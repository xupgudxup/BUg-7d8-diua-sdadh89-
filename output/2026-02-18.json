    "fullText": "Nottingham Forest boss Vitor Pereira has been speaking to the media before Thursday's Europa League play-off first leg at Fenerbahce (kick-off 17:45 GMT).\n\nHere are the key lines from his news conference:\n\nPereira confirmed defender Murillo has trained with the side and is in contention for Thursday's game. However, Stefan Ortega has replaced Matz Sels in the Europa League squad, although the new boss insisted the goalkeeper's injury is not long term and he is \"recovering well\".\n\nThe head coach, who has joined on an 18-month contract, says he is \"very confident\" about the role because that is \"my character, my personality\", and added: \"I recognise the quality in my players, in the squad. We just need the click, the win, to start to be more confident.\"\n\nOn his first days at the club and what he can change for this game: \"The most important thing is my opinion. In two days, you cannot come with a lot of information. You must be intelligent to give a clear message here tactically. You know I like to play tactically in a way, and this is something that cannot change in two days.\"\n\nPereira added: \"Since the first day, I believe we can start to create identity, this is the way we want to play, and if players buy the idea and they feel they can be important in the idea then this is the way to achieve our target.\"\n\nOn playing in the atmosphere of a stadium like Fenerbahce's: \"For the players, this is the atmosphere that they enjoy to play in. They enjoy to play in this kind of energy. For me, it is a pleasure to be here and to face a team with passion and to show our passion, show our energy, show our ambition. To play with courage and organisation.\"\n\nAsked about the difficulty of playing with that courage in their current run of form, he responded: \"Since the first day you can start to give this energy to them. I believe that a team absorbs a lot of the passion and personality of the manager. We need to think about the game tomorrow as an opportunity to show our qualities, to prove ourselves, and to be proud at end of game with what we did.\"\n\nHaving had two spells at Fenerbahce, Pereira knows they are facing a \"tough game\" but is also expecting one with \"quality\" as there is \"a lot talent on the pitch\".\n\nListen to live commentary of Fenerbahce v Nottingham Forest at 17:45 on Thursday on BBC Radio Nottingham\n\nGot a question about Forest?

    "fullText": "Amber Glenn is sharing her current mood after a disappointing short program at the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Olympics\n\nThe Texas native popped out of a triple jump and dropped to 13th place\n\nGlenn, a mental health advocate, shared two positive messages on social media on Wednesday\n\nAmber Glenn says she is “coping well” one day after skating a disappointing short program that landed her in 13th place at the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Olympics.\n\nOn Tuesday, Feb. 17, the Team USA skater, 26, started strong, landing her triple axel. But she flubbed a jump when she popped out of a triple toe loop, which hurt her final score.\n\nAfterwards, Glenn was seemingly inconsolable as she tearfully skated off the ice to the kiss-and-cry area where she received her score, 67.39, more than 11 points off the lead.\n\nThe following day, the Plano, Texas native shared two posts on social media that gave a status update on her current mood on the eve of Thursday’s final.\n\n“Landing my highest scoring 3Axel,” she wrote over a video of herself celebrating, before she then hung her head, “Messing up the last jump and getting it invalidated.”\n\n“I'm coping well thanks for asking 🤪” Glenn captioned the TikTok.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nOn her Instagram Stories, the U.S. national champ shared an adorable image of a dog wearing a baseball cap with an inspirational message.\n\n“The world has ended for me many times and yet tomorrow still comes. Keep going,” the post read.\n\nComing into the Olympics, Glenn was a favorite, having earned eight individual first-place finishes since 2024. The athlete, an outspoken mental health advocate, has also won the last three U.S. championships, according to NBC Sports.\n\nDuring the Games, she won a gold medal as part of the team skating event.\n\nWhen she skated off the ice in Milan on Tuesday, commentator Tara Lipinski articulated what many fans were thinking.\n\n“This is heartbreaking to watch,” the 1998 Winter Olympics gold medalist said.\n\nTeammate Alysa Liu’s short program was a success, landing her in third place going into Thursday, but it was Glenn’s emotional state that was on her mind.\n\n“She’s gone through so much and she works so friggen’ hard, like genuinely, such a hard worker and she’s overcome a lot,” Liu told reporters, including PEOPLE. “I just want her to be happy. That’s genuinely all I want. And so I’ll be seeing her later, don’t worry guys. We’ll stick together.”\n\nTo learn more about all the Olympic and Paralympic hopefuls, come to people.com to check out ongoing coverage before, during and after the games.

    "description": "NFL previously opened an investigation after abuse allegations emerged on Instagram.",
    "fullText": "Earlier this year, domestic violence allegations against Chiefs receiver Rashee Rice surfaced on Instagram. New allegations have emerged against Rice in a lawsuit that was initiated earlier this week.\n\nVia James Newell of The Athletic, the civil complaint filed Monday in Dallas County District Court includes the following contentions: \"Defendant Rashee Rice and Plaintiff Dacoda Jones lived together. Following an escalation in violent behavior, in December, 2023, Defendant Rashee Rice strangled Plaintiff Dacoda Joans [sic] at their shared home in Victory Park, Texas. Defendant Rashee Rice continued to repeatedly assaulted Dacoda Jones over the course of their relationship through July, 2025. Defendant Rice has grabbed, choked, strangled, pushed, thrown, scratched, hit, and headbutted Ms. Jones, as well as hit her with inanimate objects. Additionally, he has engaged in other violent and abusive behaviors towards Ms. Jones, including throwing objects, destroying property, punching walls, and breaking furniture, as well as locking her out in the middle of the night. Many of these behaviors occurred while Ms. Jones was pregnant.\"\n\nThe league previously commenced a review based on the allegations from Instagram. The league undoubtedly will expand the investigation to include the claims made in the new lawsuit.\n\nRice served a six-game suspension to start the 2025 season, following a guilty plea to a March 2024 street-racing incident. His history could result in enhanced penalties, if the league finds he violated the Personal Conduct Policy again.\n\nThe situation also potentially impacts Rice's probation resulting from the street-racing incident. The agreement was announced in July; if any potential abuse occurred after the five-year period of probation commenced, he could face an argument that he violated the terms of his probation.",

    "fullText": "Through the Longhorns' first four games of the 2026 campaign, their offense has looked unstoppable, scoring 41 runs. While they have gotten contributions from everyone, Ethan Mendoza is one player who has stood out. The Texas native was one of the Longhorns' best hitters last season and has picked up where he left off.\n\nAs Texas has gotten off to an undefeated start, Mendoza has posted a .375 batting average in 16 at-bats. In that stretch, the Southlake Carroll alum has added two home runs and seven RBI to his resume. While it is only a small sample size, Mendoza has shown great plate discipline, drawing four walks.\n\nEthan Mendoza (@SCSpikes '23) started his 2026 campaign flexing his 💪 for @TexasBaseball with 🤘 💣 s!\n\nThe junior hit five last season and led the team with a .333 batting average. pic.twitter.com/VajvsLxpVB\n\n— MLB Draft League (@mlbdraftleague) February 16, 2026\n\nWhile Mendoza has made headlines with his bat, he has caused some chaos on the basepaths. The Longhorns infielder has two stolen bases after finishing last season with 15. If he can continue to add speed to his game to go with above-average power, he will be a matchup nightmare for pitchers. For the Longhorns, that would be a welcome development as they chase a national title.\n\nAfter breaking onto the scene during the 2025 campaign, Mendoza is showing that his success as a sophomore was no fluke. He finished his first season in the Forty Acres with a .333 batting average in 56 games. The Longhorns' star also drove in 35 runs and recorded five home runs and four triples.\n\nTexas 2B Ethan Mendoza is a MENACE. The kid has never stopped hitting going back to his high school days.\n\nBut with one small change, could he unlock an entirely new gear?\n\n👇STORY👇 pic.twitter.com/ZCHytmNTkn\n\n— Over-Slot Baseball (@OverSlot_) December 29, 2025\n\nWith the regular season far from over, Mendoza will have plenty of time to build on his success. He is an elite hitter and is drawing the attention of scouts for MLB teams with every line drive he hits. Although the Longhorns have high expectations this year, Mendoza is showing early on that he can be a catalyst for a team looking to bring a title to Austin.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Longhorns Wire: Texas baseball 2B Ethan Mendoza picks up where he left off last season",

Incredibly, the U.S. has not defeated Sweden in Olympic play since 1960 — a stretch that includes the famous 2-2 draw just before the Miracle on Ice in 1980.\n\nStanding in their way is a Swedish side overflowing with elite talent, led by a defensive corps featuring Victor Hedman, Erik Karlsson, and Rasmus Dahlin.

    "fullText": "On February 18, 2001, NASCAR experienced a moment that permanently divided its history into before and after. Dale Earnhardt, seven-time Cup Series champion and one of the most recognizable figures in American motorsports, was killed on the final lap of the Daytona 500. He was 49 years old, and the sport he helped define would never look the same again.\n\nThe crash occurred in Turn 4 as the field charged toward the checkered flag. Earnhardt was defending position behind his DEI teammates, Michael Waltrip and Dale Earnhardt Jr., when contact with Ken Schrader sent the No. 3 Chevrolet head-on into the outside wall. The car slid down into the infield grass, coming to rest as the race concluded and confusion began to ripple through the grandstands and television broadcast.\n\nAt 5:16 p.m. ET, Earnhardt was pronounced dead at Halifax Medical Center. What began as a routine final-lap crash became the most consequential day in modern NASCAR history.\n\nThe cruelty of that afternoon was rooted in contrast. Michael Waltrip had just earned his first Cup Series victory after more than 400 starts, and Dale Jr. finished second, giving Dale Earnhardt Incorporated a stunning 1-2 result in the sport’s biggest race. It should have been a celebration that echoed across the garage for years.\n\nInstead, the emotional tone shifted in real time. Television coverage grew subdued. Drivers and crew members stood silently. The infield grass where the black No. 3 had come to rest became the focal point of an uneasy stillness. Although NASCAR had seen violent crashes before, this one carried a different gravity that became undeniable as time passed.\n\nEarnhardt had built a reputation for walking away from hard hits. His toughness was part of his legend, and many fans initially assumed he would once again climb from the car. The confirmation that followed hours later sent shockwaves far beyond Daytona Beach and permanently altered how the sport would approach safety.\n\nStatistics explain part of Earnhardt’s greatness, but they do not fully capture his presence. He won seven Cup Series championships, tying Richard Petty and Cale Yarborough. He earned 428 top-10 finishes, claimed 22 pole positions, and finally captured his long-awaited Daytona 500 victory in 1998 after years of near-misses on NASCAR’s biggest stage.\n\nWhat separated Earnhardt from other champions was the way he controlled a race without always leading it. Competitors adjusted their lines when he filled their mirrors. Fans reacted viscerally to his every move, either cheering him with loyalty or booing him with equal intensity. He embodied a version of NASCAR that was raw, competitive, and unapologetically physical.\n\nThe nickname “The Intimidator” was not a marketing invention; it was earned through decades of calculated aggression and racecraft. He understood drafting strategy at superspeedways better than most of his contemporaries and mastered the mental side of stock car racing. His influence extended beyond results and into the psychological fabric of the sport.\n\nEarnhardt’s death forced NASCAR into a reckoning that had been building quietly for years. Safety equipment and structural improvements that had once been optional or inconsistently adopted became mandatory across the Cup Series. The HANS device was required. SAFER barriers were installed at tracks nationwide. Six-point harness systems and enhanced seat construction became standard components rather than upgrades.\n\nThese changes reshaped the physical risk landscape of NASCAR competition. Since February 2001, there have been no driver fatalities in the Cup Series, a statistic that underscores how dramatically the sport evolved in response to that loss. The reforms were not cosmetic adjustments; they were structural transformations that altered car design, track engineering, and driver expectations.\n\nEvery modern NASCAR driver competes in a machine influenced by the lessons learned from Turn 4 in 2001. The safety advances implemented in the aftermath stand as a lasting legacy tied directly to that day.\n\nTwenty-five years later, the No. 3 remains one of the most recognizable numbers in racing. The black paint scheme and silver trim still carry emotional weight for longtime fans, while younger audiences understand its importance through history rather than firsthand experience. When NASCAR returns to Daytona each February, the memory of that final lap remains embedded in the narrative of the event.\n\nDale Earnhardt Jr. carried the family name into the modern era, becoming one of the sport’s most popular drivers while navigating the emotional complexity of racing at tracks so closely tied to his father’s legacy. The broader NASCAR community continues to reference Earnhardt’s competitive style and championship pedigree when debating the greatest drivers of all time.\n\nThe sport has evolved in technology, media exposure, and competitive structure, but Earnhardt’s shadow remains visible in each of those transitions. He represented a bridge between NASCAR’s regional roots and its national growth, helping to carry the sport into a new century before his life was cut short.\n\nThe 2001 Daytona 500 stands as both a tragic loss and a turning point. It marked the end of one era and accelerated the beginning of another defined by modern safety standards and heightened awareness of driver protection. NASCAR did not freeze in time after that day; it changed course.\n\nYet for all the innovation that followed, the memory of Dale Earnhardt continues to shape how fans and competitors interpret the sport’s identity. He was not simply one of its greatest champions; he was a defining figure whose presence extended beyond trophies and statistics. His career defined intensity, resilience, and a willingness to compete at the edge.\n\nTwenty-five years later, NASCAR still races forward, but it does so with a clear understanding of what was lost and what was learned. Dale Earnhardt’s legacy lives not only in record books, but in the safety systems, cultural memory, and competitive spirit that continue to define the sport today.",

    "title": "Amber Glenn hopes she can still experience the Olympic moment of her dreams",
    "description": "U.S. figure skater Amber Glenn says she's hoping to achieve something more special to her than an Olympic medal during her free skate.",
    "fullText": "The medal wasn’t what Amber Glenn wanted. When she botched the final jump of her otherwise faultless short program, it was the shattering of her dream that left Glenn more distraught than the score that dropped her to 13th place.\n\n“I was devastated that I lost the happiness and the enjoyment that I wanted to have out there on the ice to say, like, I fought for everything, I did everything I could,” Glenn said Wednesday after training at Milano Ice Skating Arena. “That's what I truly wanted, and that's what I missed out on.”\n\nGlenn was one jump away from her moment Tuesday. She aced her triple axel and got her combination jump. The crowd's excitement was building. Then she popped the final jump attempt, unraveling in the air and stopping short of the planned three revolutions. She clutched the necklaces on her dress at center ice afterward and sobbing while hugging her coach.\n\nOne of the leaders for building the team camaraderie that has defined this era of U.S. women’s figure skating, Glenn found comfort in her fellow “Blade Angel” Alysa Liu, who was quick to offer an encouraging hug. Glenn instead wanted Liu to enjoy her own moment after the 20-year-old from Oakland was third entering Thursday's free skate.\n\n“She's super strong,” Liu said Tuesday night, “so she can handle it.”\n\nLiu, the reigning world champion, remains the United States’ last, best hope for a figure skating medal in Milan. The United States has not won an Olympic medal in women's singles skating since 2006. Liu is only 2.12 points behind first-place Ami Nakai. Nakai’s Japanese teammate Kaori Sakamoto is second with 77.23 points, only 1.48 points behind her 17-year-old teammate and 0.64 points ahead of Liu.\n\nThe top six are separated by only 6.94 points after a competitive short program event that featured strong performances from most of the top contenders, including the United States’ Isabeau Levito. The 2024 world silver medalist is in eighth, but just 5.75 points behind Liu. The difference could be equivalent to the base value of one triple jump.\n\nThe high standard set by other competitors made Glenn's singular mistake even more costly in the short program. While the free skate is more forgiving, the short program has seven specific requirements, including three for jumps. One jump has to be a double or triple axel. There has to be a jump combination that consists of a double jump and a triple jump or two triple jumps. And there has to be another triple jump.\n\nSo when the stand-alone triple loop toward the end of Glenn’s program turned into a double, it meant the entire element was void and she earned nothing for it. During the free skate, the same mistake would simply earn a lower base value.\n\nThe triple loop was the easiest jump in Glenn’s program and her favorite, she said. But she tapped her foot while spinning and lost her balance.\n\n“I was a little bit noodley,” Glenn said.\n\nStill needing to perform three more required elements, Glenn tried to smile through her step sequence to save every fraction of a point she could. She has seen the stories of Norwegian Alpine skier Atle Lie McGrath trudging off the giant slalom course and lying in the snow after a mistake cost him a chance at a gold medal during these Games. She wished she had that option.\n\n“[The judges] expect you to still perform like you're having the time of your life,” Glenn said, “when, in reality, your dreams are just smashed to pieces.”\n\nGlenn has shown her resilience already in Milan. She struggled on the first two elements of her free skate during the team competition but instead of crumbling the way she often did when she was younger, Glenn rallied to finish third. The United States held on to win the gold medal by one point. The moment was a testament to Glenn's growth, she said.\n\nYears of mental preparation have helped Glenn get to the Olympic stage, but she said nothing could prepare her for the unique stress of the Games. She wanted to say that these experiences could serve as learning opportunities for her next Olympic run, but she knows that’s unlikely at this stage of her career.\n\nInstead, Glenn’s experiences set an example for her teammates. The 18-year-old Levito, the youngest of the U.S. skaters, said she hopes to return to the Olympics in 2030 because Glenn has shown her what’s possible.\n\n“Seeing Amber being here at 26 is very inspiring and also kind of reassuring that I, in fact, could go so long,” Levito said. “She's in her prime, I feel, at 26.”\n\nThe three-time U.S. champion still became an Olympic champion in Milan. Glenn already has her medal from the team event. Now she just wants her moment, the one she pictured as a child.\n\n“I always imagined, like, me doing like a spiral and looking up being like ‘I'm at the Olympics,'\" Glenn said with optimism in her voice. “That's what I want.”\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "Darius Acuff is one of the best guards in the country, and he hopes to leave Alabama with a win when they meet Arkansas.\n\nI expect him to find plenty of success in an open floor matchup.\n\nRead why I’m grabbing the Over on his assist prop in my Arkansas vs. Alabama predictions and college basketball picks for Wednesday, February 18.\n\nArkansas vs Alabama best bet: Darius Acuff Over 5.5 assists (-155)\n\nI’m rolling with one of the best guards in the country to play like it tonight. The Arkansas Razorbacks transition offense ranks in the 98th percentile in both frequency and efficiency, while the Alabama Crimson Tide gives up transition looks at one of the highest clips in the sport.\n\nDarius Acuff is the primary transition pusher for the Hogs and a facilitator of pick-and-roll and pick-and-pop actions.\n\nHe's hit 5+ assists in four of his last five, including 7 and 9 dimes in his last two. In a game that should be insanely free-flowing, I expect Acuff to shine.\n\nAlabama runs the fastest tempo in the country, and Arkansas isn't far behind. This Over is high, in fact, it’s very high, but even so, it seems like there’s still a little value in this number.\n\nIt’s the first leg of my parlay simply because neither team will have interest in slowing things down.\n\nI paired it with Latrell Wrightsell to go Over 2.5 threes. The senior has 20 combined attempts from deep (!!!) over the last two games and should benefit from a game played so freely on the open floor.\n\nLatrell Wrightsell Over 2.5 threes\n\nQuietly, Alabama has struggled defensively against pick-and-pops, allowing over one point per possession on such sets.\n\nTrevon Brazile is almost exclusively the only option for these actions, which makes a +150 price point on Over 1.5 threes very enticing. It leads the way on my long-shot parlay.\n\nI paired it with Aden Holloway to go Over a low-assist number. It’s a play simply on a game that will be played at such a frantic pace, with the ball in his hands so often.\n\nLatrell Wrightsell Over 2.5 threes\n\nSpread: Arkansas +5 (-115) | Alabama -5 (-105)\n\nMoneyline: Arkansas +180 | Alabama -220\n\nOver/Under: Over 184.5 (-110) | Under 184.5 (-110)\n\nArkansas has hit the Moneyline in 19 of their last 25 games (+11.55 Units / 1% ROI).

    "fullText": "Arsenal players have recently been sustaining injuries during pre-match warm-ups, prompting the club to consider scrapping the routine altogether. The worrying pattern has raised concerns within the squad and coaching staff as they seek to protect key players during a demanding campaign.\n\nBukayo Saka and Riccardo Calafiori are among those who have suffered injuries during warm-ups shortly before kick-off. Such incidents have proven particularly frustrating, especially when players have already been named in the starting lineup, only to be ruled out moments before the match begins. The recurrence of these setbacks has intensified debate about whether changes to pre-match preparations are required.\n\nThis season has otherwise been a positive one for Mikel Arteta’s side, who have been widely regarded as the strongest team in England so far. Significant investment was made in squad depth during the summer transfer window, yet injuries have continued to disrupt their progress. Losing important players repeatedly has tested the resilience of the squad, despite the additional reinforcements.\n\nThe prospect of further injuries in the coming weeks remains a concern. However, the nature of these particular setbacks, occurring during warm-ups rather than in competitive action, has proven especially troubling. It has led to internal discussions about whether the traditional pre-match routine is contributing to the issue.\n\n(Photo by Eddie Keogh/Getty Images)\n\nAs reported by Sports Illustrated, Mikel Arteta addressed the situation and suggested that the club may need to reevaluate its approach. He said, “To change that sometimes is tricky.\n\n“It is a really good area to have a look. What would happen if we don’t do the warmup? Because then. At half time, we go and sit almost for 15 minutes and then go full gas in the second half. Maybe it is something to think about.”\n\nHis comments reveal the seriousness with which the matter is being treated, as Arsenal explore possible adjustments to reduce the risk of further untimely injuries.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSo here are some simple rules which I must insist commenters follow….\n\nYou agree not to give any personal abuse to other Arsenal fans. Everyone is allowed to hold their own opinions even if you disagree with them. It COSTS NOTHING TO BE POLITE TO OTHER ARSENAL FANS.\n\nCALLING ALL ARSENAL FANS!

The overwhelming favorite to win MVP this season in the National League is none other than Shohei Ohtani. The 31-year-old two-way superstar is at the top of the leader board, and that comes as no surprise.\n\nBetts will have an uphill battle for that award, especially after the season he just endured. The Dodgers 2025 regular season was not magical at all, and neither was the four-time champions play.\n\nIn the season, the eight-time All-Star slashed .258/.326/.406 with a .732 OPS (the lowest of his career). Health was on Betts’ side as he played 150 games; however, he was never able to find his groove.\n\nBetts has finished inside the top 10 of MVP voting seven times in his career and in the top five five times. The Tennessee native is no stranger to MVP-level seasons; the only question is whether he can still produce at that level.\n\nThe six-time Gold Glove winner’s production has trended downward in recent seasons, and heading into Year 13, Father Time is beginning to loom. Fortunately for the Dodgers, they don’t need him to play superhero to contend.\n\nThe Dodgers are loaded with talent from top to bottom. If Betts is at least a bit better compared to last season, L.A. should have no problem cruising to their 10th title in franchise history.\n\nRoberts said on Wednesday that he is leaning towards having Betts bat No. 3 in the order against both left and right handed pitching in 2026.\n\nSince Ohtani arrived in Los Angeles, Betts was the No. 2 batter in the order. However, with a dip in productivity and the arrival of Kyle Tucker, that leaves Roberts with no choice. Still, Betts is expected to produce and play a big role for L.A.",

    "fullText": "GLENDALE – Arizona Cardinals head coach Mike LaFleur was asked about the future of Kyler Murray in the desert. His answer? They are still having open roster conversations with no timetable. In today’s NFL, that’s not nonchalant; that’s calculated with a message.\n\nArizona Cardinals new head coach Mike LaFleur at a news conference on Feb. 3, 2026, at Arizona Cardinals training center in Tempe. © Rob Schumacher/The Republic / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images\n\nThis isn’t about performance alone. Murray has flashed incredible talent over his time in Arizona during his healthy stretches, but availability and trajectory matter. Since 2022, injuries have limited continuity, and Arizona’s roster has shifted toward a reset. Financially, the equation is delicate. Moving on from Murray would trigger significant dead money, but it could also unlock draft capital and schematic clarity. The Cardinals aren’t just evaluating a quarterback; they’re evaluating a timeline. Does Murray align with where the franchise will peak next?\n\nCardinals quarterback Kyler Murray gets wired up on the sidelines during a preseason game against the Raiders at State Farm Stadium in Glendale on Aug. 23, 2025. © Patrick Breen/The Republic / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images\n\nAround the league, quarterback demand never sleeps. Teams like the New York Jets, Minnesota Vikings, and Pittsburgh Steelers have all faced recent instability at the position. A trade market would exist; the question is whether Arizona believes Murray’s best football fits their future or someone else’s present, and can they even find a trade partner that will give Arizona a fair deal?\n\nOct 5, 2025; Glendale, Arizona, USA; Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray (1) warms up before their game against the Tennessee Titans at State Farm Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Joe Camporeale-Imagn Images\n\nFor Cardinals fans, this isn’t abstract. It’s emotional. Murray was the No. 1 overall pick. He represented hope, explosiveness, and relevance. Moving on would signal a philosophical reset, and patience over potential. LaFleur’s short answer wasn’t indecision. It was leverage, as the Cardinals are weighing identity against investment. Although when a coach won’t define a quarterback’s future, the writing might be on the wall for what the future may hold.\n\nCardinals HC Mike LaFleur excited about Arizona’s new coaching staff",

    "fullText": "TESERO, Italy (AP) — Outside the Olympic cross-country stadium in the Dolomite mountains, Norwegian flags drape over the railings like bunting on a national holiday.\n\nFans from the Scandinavian country have set up camp nearby and keep a live tally of medals won by their athletes at the Milan Cortina Games. After every victory, a gold sticker is pressed onto the board.\n\nThere have been plenty to add: Norway leads the medals table with 33 — 15 gold, eight silver and 10 bronze. And its dominance has raised a familiar question: What makes Norway, a nation of 5.6 million people, such a superpower on the snow at the world’s biggest winter sports event?\n\nThe country’s Olympic arsenal this year is led by Johannes Hoesflot Klaebo, a cross-country skier and gold medal machine. He has won five gold medals at the Milan Cortina Games to take his career tally to a Winter Games record of 10.\n\nKlaebo earned his fifth gold on Wednesday in the men’s team sprint. He held off a late American charge to win in 18 minutes, 28.9 seconds.\n\nThe 29-year-old Klaebo, who is competing at his third Olympics, said the collective experience his team has built up is the key to winning races.\n\n“In a team sprint, a lot of it is about staying in front and skiing as efficiently as possible. We know from experience that it’s usually decided on the final lap,” Klaebo said.\n\n“Luckily, I’ve been in that position a few times now, and I feel comfortable there,” he said. “We just needed to enjoy it and stay in the mix — and when it came down to the final sprint, that’s when it mattered. Today, that worked out perfectly.”\n\nMany believe Klaebo’s remarkable golden run is a product of a system that has few equals in winter sports.\n\nKaterina Neumannova, a retired Czech Olympic champion, points to Norway’s structure as the foundation of its success. Cross-country skiing is among the country’s most popular sports, with hundreds of clubs and large numbers of kids starting young.\n\n“When you have so many children, so many trainers and so many clubs all around Norway, it’s much easier to find special talent,” Neumannova told The Associated Press.\n\nNorway, she said, has benefitted from the absence of the banned Russian team as well as having a concentration of talented team officials supporting athletes, and even the lack of snow in lower latitudes affecting mainland Europe.\n\nAnd its depth of public participation, she argued, provides a steady supply of elite competitors.\n\n“Other countries usually have some gaps between generations, but the Norwegian team is very stable,” Neumannova said. “When one athlete ends, younger ones are already coming up.”\n\nKlaebo’s race partner on Wednesday was Einar Hedegart, a 24-year-old Olympic rookie who shared gold in an earlier relay event and won bronze in the 10-kilometer interval start.\n\n“There’s definitely some pressure that comes with racing alongside Johannes, so it’s both a relief and a joy to pull off here today,” Hedegart said after Wednesday’s race.\n\n“To win two gold medals in my first (Olympic) championship is huge,” he said. “It’s an incredibly good feeling.”\n\nA lot Norway’s supremacy stems from tradition as the cradle of Nordic skiing.\n\nTen medals — six of them gold — come from cross‑country, and another nine from biathlon. Ski jumper Anna Odine Stroem swept both the normal and large hills, and added a silver in the mixed team event. Jens Luraas Oftebro took both Nordic combined titles.\n\nThe medals don’t stop there: Norway struck twice in freestyle skiing, picked up two in Alpine skiing, and completed the speedskating set with a gold, silver and bronze.\n\nFinn Dahl, a superfan who did marketing for the 1994 Lillehammer Olympics at home in Norway, attributed his country's success to a way of life that revolves around snow.\n\nChildren, he said, often take trips with their families to the mountains, where skiing is just the normal way of getting around.\n\n“It’s a natural way of sort of moving from one cabin to another,” Dahl said. “It’s a spirit, it is inside you.”\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "fullText": "Ex-NBA star Enes Kanter Freedom piled on to the often-conservative criticism of freestyle skiing great Eileen Gu on Wednesday.\n\nGu, whose mother is Chinese, was born in San Francisco but is representing China for the second straight Winter Olympics.\n\nPolitics: Trump's Latest Epstein Denial Has Critics Asking New Questions\n\nShe has earned China two silver medals in the Milan Cortina Games with the halfpipe up next. She won two golds and a silver in 2022. She has vaulted to international fame as an athlete and sometimes a model, reportedly earning tens of millions of dollars a year ― a chunk of which she has received from the Chinese government.\n\nBut as in the last Winter Olympics, Gu has gotten heat for her choice, though it should be noted that several U.S.-born athletes compete for other countries. Brazil’s Lucas Pinheiro Braathen, who was born in Oslo but has a Brazilian mother, has been widely celebrated during the Games for representing a country other than his birthplace. Gu’s defenders have suggested that racism and Sinophobia are factors in why she is being treated differently.\n\n“I’m just going to say it. She’s a traitor,” Freedom told Fox News host Laura Ingraham on Wednesday. “She was born in America. She was raised in America, lives in America, and chooses to compete against her own country for, literally, the worst human rights abuser on the planet, China. She built her fame in a free country, and then chooses to represent an authoritarian regime.”\n\nKanter Freedom: Eileen Gu Is a traitor. She was born in America and chooses to compete against her own country. pic.twitter.com/gAh4YbrFpt\n\n— Acyn (@Acyn) February 18, 2026\n\nThe former center, who played for the Utah Jazz, New York Knicks and other teams in the NBA from 2011 to 2022, added “Freedom” to his name when he became a U.S. citizen in 2021. The former Turkish citizen was outspoken against the Turkish government and had his passport canceled by the country in 2017. He often speaks out against human rights abuses in China.\n\nBefore the Games, Gu defended her choice to represent China.\n\nPolitics: Money And Power Converge As CBS Becomes Trump State Media\n\n“The U.S. already has the representation,” Gu said, per Newsweek. “I like building my own pond.”\n\nShe also dismissed speculation that she chose China because the financial windfall was potentially greater.\n\n“I’m glad that there’s enough money in the sport now for people to think that’s a consideration,” Gu said.\n\nLike this article? Keep independent journalism alive. Support HuffPost.\n\nEven Vice President JD Vance weighed in about Gu’s decision, starting off diplomatically but eventually throwing some shade her way.\n\nAsked by Fox News’ Martha MacCallum on Tuesday if the status of the San Francisco-born athlete should be “changed,” the veep replied: “Well, look, I have no idea what her status should be. I think that’s ultimately up to the Olympics Committee. I won’t pretend to wade into that.”\n\nPolitics: Homeland Security Flack Tricia McLaughlin Set To Leave Trump Administration\n\n“I certainly think that somebody who grew up in the United States of America, who benefited from our education system, from the freedoms and liberties that make this country a great place, I would hope that they want to compete with the United States of America,” he added.\n\n“So, I’m going to root for American athletes, and I think part of that is people who identify themselves as Americans. That’s who I’m rooting for this Olympics,” Vance said.\n\nFox News Host Asks Vance If U.S.-Born Olympian Should Lose ‘Status’ Skiing For China\n\nOlympian's *** Confession Spreads To Another Sport In Wild 'Late Show' Send-Up\n\nItaly Taunts U.S. In Oh-So-Familiar Style After Winning Speedskating Team Event",

    "fullText": "In the middle of what was already shaping up to be one of the most physically grueling stretches of her Olympic return, Skiing icon Lindsey Vonn has now shared a deeply personal loss that puts everything into perspective.\n\nDays after suffering a frightening crash at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milano Cortina, the skiing icon revealed she was quietly dealing with heartbreak far beyond the slopes.\n\nOn February 18, Vonn announced that her beloved dog Leo had passed away on February 9 following a recent battle with lung cancer, just one day after her Olympic crash.\n\nMORE: Lindsey Vonn injury update is encouraging, but ‘leg still in pieces’\n\nShe opened up about her dog’s passing on X. “2/9/2026\n\nLeo passed away. The day after my crash I said goodbye to my big boy as I laid in my hospital bed. Been some of the hardest days of my life and still have not begun to process his passing. I will always love you Leo\n\nLeo passed away. The day after my crash I said goodbye to by my big boy as I laid in my hospital bed. Been some of the hardest days of my life and still have not begun to process his passing… \n\nI will always love you Leo\n\n— lindsey vonn (@lindseyvonn) February 18, 2026\n\nIn her emotional post on Instagram, Lindsey Vonn said Leo had been by her side since her second ACL injury in 2013, when she needed him the most, helping her through some of the lowest points of her career. She added that he stayed close to her during recovery, even lying beside her on the couch as she watched the Sochi Olympics while sidelined from competition.\n\nVonn explained that Leo had recently been diagnosed with lung cancer after previously surviving lymphoma about a year and a half ago, but his health had rapidly declined as his heart began to fail. She noted that he was in significant pain toward the end, and the day after her Olympic crash, she had to say goodbye to him from her hospital bed.\n\nShe further shared that over the past 13 years, Leo had consistently lifted her spirits during injuries and personal struggles, always making her feel safe and supported through difficult moments.\n\nVonn also said she believes he is now at peace and reunited with Lucy, Bear, and several loved ones she has lost in recent years, describing Leo as someone who would always remain her first love.

    "description": "Having first signed a deal with DAZN in 2018, Matchroom will continue with the streaming platform",
    "fullText": "Matchroom Boxing has announced a new deal with DAZN, as the promotion extends its contract with the streaming platform until 2031.\n\nMatchroom initially signed with DAZN in 2018, penning a five-year deal after splitting from Sky Sports. They then renewed for 3 years in 2023. Matchroom Boxing have also signed a new partnership with DAZN’s Foxtel Group in Australia, bringing seven major events to Australian audiences on Kayo Sports.\n\nThe a new five-year deal is set to keep the likes of Anthony Joshua, Katie Taylor, Conor Benn, Shakur Stevenson, Dmitry Bivol, Jesse “Bam” Rodriguez, and Ben Whittaker on DAZN until 2031 – barring any retirements or fresh promotional contracts elsewhere.\n\nPer a press release issued on Wednesday, the new deal concerns the UK and US, and will bring “more than 30 shows globally per year”.\n\nMatchroom Boxing chairman Eddie Hearn said: “DAZN is the only partner that matches our ambitions for boxing. Their global platform, investment, passion and commitment to boxing make them the perfect partner for [our] fighters and events. This new deal in two of the world’s most important boxing markets reinforces our belief and trust in DAZN, and the scale of what we can achieve together.”\n\nJoshua’s last fight actually took place on Netflix, where DAZN permitted the former heavyweight champion to box Jake Paul in December. Joshua, 36, stopped the influencer in six rounds in Miami, just days before suffering injuries in a fatal car crash in Nigeria.\n\nJoshua’s boxing future is up in the air following that accident, in which “AJ” was a passenger and his teammates Sina Ghami and Latif “Latz” Ayodele were killed.\n\nFurthermore, with all-time great Taylor nearing retirement at 39 years old, DAZN will likely look to younger Matchroom talents like Benn, Stevenson, Rodriguez and Whittaker to carry the brand going forward.\n\nStevenson last boxed in January, outpointing fellow American Teofimo Lopez with a masterful performance. That victory kept Stevenson, 28, unbeaten and saw him win a world title at a fourth weight.\n\nAfter that bout in New York City, 29-year-old Benn entered the Madison Square Garden ring to face off with Stevenson.\n\nMeanwhile, British talent Whittaker is slowly building towards the prospect of a world-title shot at light-heavyweight, having made his Matchroom debut in November. On that occasion, he stopped Benjamin Gavazi in the first round.\n\nBivol, recently undisputed at light-heavyweight, is eyeing a return to the ring later this year after recovering from injury, while Rodriguez is establishing himself as a top pound-for-pound talent.",

    "fullText": "Josh Rock blamed his error-strewn display in last week's 6-2 Premier League defeat by Michael van Gerwen in Antwerp on the soap he used in the bathroom before going on stage.\n\nThe 24-year-old was seen wiping his hands on his trousers multiple times and licking his fingers at one stage during the quarter-final contest.\n\nNorthern Ireland's Rock believes his inability to grip the darts properly was caused by the soap and he has now sought to guard against it happening to him at future events by packing his own chalk and wax.\n\n\"I went to the toilet just before I went on stage and obviously you wash your hands after going to the toilet, so I put the soap all over my hands and the next minute I'm up there, and I was like, 'This isn't going to go well',\" he said.\n\n\"I just could not feel it at all. So now we've got a plan B, I've got a bit of chalk and wax in the case from now on.\n\n\"I didn't have to use it this week at the Players Championship, it was fine, but it must have been the soap I used.\n\n\"That was the first time it's happened. It must be just whatever soap was in the toilet at Antwerp that I used and it just obviously took all the oils out of my finger and lost all grip.\"\n\nWorld number nine Rock admitted his natural reaction to his struggles against seven-time champion Van Gerwen was to \"laugh straight away\" because he \"knew what the problem was\".\n\nHe has now put that performance down to misfortune and moved on as he prepares to take on world number two Luke Humphries in night three of the competition in Glasgow on Thursday before competing in front of a home crowd in Belfast on 26 February.\n\n\"If I played like that and didn't know what the problem was then, obviously we have an issue,\" he added.\n\n\"But I knew I couldn't grip my hands and no matter how much I was trying to lick my fingers, rub my finger up and down a barrel to get my fingers rough, it wasn't working, so I just let that one go.\"",

    "title": "NASCAR officials address holding the caution, fuel saving tactics at Daytona",
    "description": "There's no real shift in any policy and race control made decisions based on driver feedback",
    "fullText": "It appeared over the weekend that NASCAR implemented a new policy that made an extra effort to not reasonably throw a caution on the final lap of a superspeedway race.\n\nIt appeared that way because NASCAR evenly applied that stance in both the Truck and Cup race across two different race directors. But also, throughout the weekend, solo car spins without any additional contact that unevenly drew cautions prior to this weekend did not.\n\nThere looked like a concerted effort to be more cautious with the caution.\n\nCup Series managing director Brad Moran was on SiriusXM NASCAR Radio on Wednesday morning and said the Sanctioning Body was more fortunate that the incidents under this particular microscope didn’t result in a yellow flag, circumstantially.\n\n“The race directors did a great, great job this weekend,” Moran said. “Chase Brashears called the Truck and the O'Reilly Race and Tim Bermann called the Cup Race. The Cup race was a little more challenging but we have a lot of resources. We have turn spotters, cameras and replay, a lot of folks in the tower. We have remote race control.\n\n“We have all these resources that communicate to us, and we felt there was nothing that we had to immediately go out … we were still monitoring the situation in (Turn 1) and we were able to let that one play out to the start-finish line.\n\n“Obviously, the caution came out when the leaders got together right at start-finish line. They crossed over it under green and then the caution flew. That’s all within a split second. So we definitely held it as long as we could but we would try to do that last year, the year before and nothing changed. It just laid out that we could do it at this particular race.”\n\nOn NASCAR’s Hauler Talk podcast, league managing director of communications Mike Forde says they were bailed out by Daytona’s significant run-off area and that this may not play out the same on the last lap this weekend at Atlanta.\n\n“We may see a hit that looks hard, a nose-into-the-wall collision that bent the front clip, and we need to get safety trucks out there as soon as possible,” Forde said. “We did not see that in Daytona.\n\n“Or that same type of wreck could happen, but the runoff area in Atlanta is nonexistent. There is a ton of runoff area in Daytona. And so because of that, they were able to get out of harm’s way. In Atlanta, that probably won’t be the case, so there may be a flag. We are going to do our best to maintain consistency. That is the ultimate goal, but every wreck is a snowflake. No two wrecks are the same, and because we’re at a different track, it changes the game.”\n\nThe only recent change, says Forde, is that NASCAR will be more diligent about throwing a caution if drivers would need to traverse at speed through a debris field, which came up after the Daytona 500 last year.\n\n“That was kind of a line in the sand of moving forward, this is the philosophy,” Forde said.\n\nAnd those evolving decisions are based on communication with the Driver Advisory Council through consultant Jeff Burton.\n\n“They’re making sure that the drivers feel that what we did (at Daytona) was correct,” Forde said. “And if they have any feedback, we’ll absolutely take it. … We want to make sure that the drivers feel comfortable, and that’s why we changed on the debris field philosophy. That was direct driver feedback from the likes of Denny Hamlin, Christopher Bell and others who said, ‘Don’t put us in a situation where we’ve just got to go 100 percent throttle and hope for the best.’ You can’t have that.”\n\nDenny Hamlin endorsed the approach this weekend as long as there is continued consistency.\n\n“Well, I think everyone is okay with whatever it is, as long as it's consistent,” Hamlin said. “Somebody said, as long as it's the same for all races, and this weekend, they were very consistent. So I don't think anyone should have any gripes about that.\n\n“We saw they set the tone really on Friday, and so they let those guys race it out.\n\n“I was on the other end of the track. I can tell you that I didn't think I was in any danger or the cars -- the ones that did wreck in Turn 1, they ended up all in the apron of the grass so they were off the racing surface. There might have been one kind of running the apron or limping home, but there was no more traffic to go through there.\n\n“It seems like how they're calling this now is that if you have to drive back through it, if there's multiple cars that's got to drive through it and somebody is on the racetrack, they're going to call the caution. But it seemed like to me when I drove through there 30 seconds later, nobody on the racetrack had any -- was in any danger. I was fine with it.”\n\nDenny Hamlin has a Daytona 500 fuel saving pitch that involves The Clash\n\nNASCAR on superspeedway fuel saving: 'What are we trying to fix?'\n\nNASCAR also continues to listen to fans and consider what changes could be made after another Daytona 500 featured large portions of the race asking drivers to ride in a pack at 50-60 percent throttle.\n\nThey do this to spend less time taking fuel on pit road so they can try to pick up track position that way with passing so challenging in the pack.\n\nMoran says they’re not oblivious to fan sentiment.\n\n“Yeah sure,” Moran said on Sirius. “We have a lot of fan councils and we listen. We listen to the fans and the industry. But, I don’t know when the last time you went 165 or whatever miles per hour, three-wide down the highway and it’s quite entertaining when they’re doing it.\n\n“But we understand what folks are saying. It’s not an easy fix but we’ve had meeting with industry members and crew chiefs have told us this is a tool in their tool box that they’ve learned over the years. This group is best at taking advantage of any situation and that’s how they win races.\n\n“Telling them to stop that isn’t really going to work. It is on our radar and we’re certainly looking into it. But there isn’t really one thing that we can flip the switch and change it. This is being discussed within the industry.”\n\nForde echoed that sentiment on his podcast too.\n\n“Getting rid of that entirely is probably not going to happen, but that doesn’t mean that we’re not going to try and work at it,” Forde said. “It’s something on the docket. Fans wanted change in the playoffs, we did that. Fans wanted more horsepower, we did that. Fans wanted to change the (Charlotte) Roval to the oval, we did that. So this is also on the list of fan feedback, so we’ll see. TBD and no real answers yet, but it’s something that’s on the list.”\n\nAll the reasons why the Daytona 500 meant so much to Tyler Reddick\n\nDaytona 500 win special for Tyler Reddick spotter Nick Payne\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "description": "Three Detroit Lions landed in early 2026 NFL free agency rankings. Here’s what it means for Detroit.",
    "fullText": "As the Detroit Lions continue to balance a win-now roster with long-term cap flexibility, it’s no surprise to see several key contributors showing up in early 2026 NFL free agency rankings.\n\nAccording to Daniel Popper of The Athletic, three Lions defenders landed inside his positional rankings ahead of the 2026 offseason, a reminder that Detroit’s depth and development on defense hasn’t gone unnoticed around the league.\n\nHere’s a closer look at the Lions players who made the list and what it could mean for Brad Holmes’ offseason decisions.\n\nVeteran linebacker Alex Anzalone checks in at No. 49 overall in Popper’s rankings, with a projected contract of two years, $21 million.\n\nAnzalone has quietly been one of the most reliable pieces of Detroit’s defense over the past five seasons. He’s averaged nearly 100 tackles per year with the Lions and continues to thrive as a rangy, athletic off-ball linebacker.\n\nPopper highlights Anzalone’s speed, coverage versatility, and pass-rush value, noting that his 29.0% pressure rate ranked second among all off-ball linebackers. While he may not be the most physical run defender, his ability to blitz, cover, and diagnose plays keeps him highly valuable — especially in modern defenses.\n\nComing in at No. 79, edge rusher Al-Quadin Muhammad is projected by Popper to command a two-year, $18 million deal.\n\nMuhammad put together a breakout 2025 season, finishing with 11 sacks, the most among Detroit’s impending free agents. While he doesn’t have elite size or athletic traits for an edge defender, his efficiency stands out.\n\nPopper points to Muhammad’s ability to win late in reps, strong hand usage, and consistent pressure, noting that he ranked 14th in pressure rate among players with at least 250 pass-rush snaps.\n\nThat production makes him an ideal situational pass rusher — the kind of player teams covet for third-down packages.\n\nDefensive tackle Roy Lopez lands at No. 107 in the rankings, with a projected two-year, $12 million contract.\n\nLopez isn’t flashy, but his value lies in doing the dirty work. Popper describes him as a stout, technically sound nose tackle who can hold ground against double teams while still offering some interior push on passing downs.\n\nFor a Lions defense that has emphasized toughness and gap integrity up front, Lopez’s ability to stack blockers and control the interior has been quietly important.\n\nSeeing three Lions defenders ranked by Daniel Popper reinforces just how many tough decisions Detroit may face in the 2026 offseason. Retaining all three won’t be easy, especially with cap constraints looming, but each player fills a specific role that aligns with Dan Campbell’s defensive identity.\n\nWhether Brad Holmes chooses to re-sign, replace, or reshuffle these spots, one thing is clear: the rest of the league is paying attention to Detroit’s talent pipeline — and it’s going to cost real money to keep it intact.\n\nThe post 3 Detroit Lions Included in 2026 NFL Free Agency Rankings appeared first on Detroit Sports Nation.",

We knew the winner would face the Patriots in the Super Bowl, and regardless of who represented the NFC, they would’ve been favored against New England.\n\nSeahawks star defensive back Nick Emmanwori admitted the NFC championship felt different. Being a rivalry game, a matchup between arguably the two best teams in football, it carried extra weight.\n\nHere’s what he said about that marquee matchup on Richard Sherman’s podcast.\n\n\"It was just a different feeling. No disrespect to the Patriots or nothing like that. I don't want to take nothing away from them, but that game – that game was, like, legit,\" he said of the NFC Championship tilt. \"You know how it is with the rivalries. The Rams, they come in, Stafford, he's a hell of a quarterback. McVay always got a hell of a plan. That game was definitely different. It was a different type of game. It was live. I was in my zone. I was focused.”\n\nLike their first two meetings, Rams-Seahawks came down to the wire in the NFC Championship Game. Los Angeles was 6 yards away from a go-ahead touchdown late in the fourth quarter, but couldn’t punch it in.\n\nOn the Seahawks’ ensuing drive, the Rams couldn’t get the stop they needed on defense, allowing Seattle to milk away most of the clock and burn the Rams’ final timeouts. It lived up to every bit of hype there was entering that game, proving to be a much better matchup than Seahawks-Patriots in the Super Bowl.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Rams Wire: Seahawks' Nick Emmanwori says NFC title game vs. Rams was 'different'",

Ondřej Palát's goal with 7:42 to play in the third period put the underdogs ahead 3-2, but minutes later Nick Suzuki saved Canada's hopes with a deflected goal.\n\nWHEN HIS COUNTRY NEEDED HIM MOST, NICK SUZUKI DELIVERED. 🇨🇦 pic.twitter.com/LKLlElEXpK\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 18, 2026\n\nTeam Canada's victory was not without one bit of worrying news. Sidney Crosby was ruled out of the game early in the third period after suffering a lower-body injury.\n\nThe 38-year-old, two-time Olympic gold medalist left in the second period after being hit along the boards by Nečas and Radko Gudas. It was a third big hit Crosby took in the period after Gudas and Palát connected on checks with the Team Canada captain.\n\nCrosby recovered and took a stride following the Gudas and Nečas hit, but he was seen shaking his right leg before exiting the ice. After being attended to on Canada's bench, Crosby limped down the tunnel to the locker room. He did not return to the bench for the rest of the game.\n\nCzechia was leading 2-1 at the time of Crosby's injury.",

    "fullText": "Bayern Munich and Konrad Laimer are reportedly at odds over his contract demands, but the Austrian is not concerned with the process per Sport Bild (as captured by @iMiaSanMia):\n\nKonrad Laimer on reports that contract talks between him and Bayern have stalled: “There aren’t many talks taking place at the moment. I’m still relaxed. You shouldn’t overthink it.”\n\nLaimer’s negotiations are going to be an interesting watch for fans. While no reports have confirmed anything regarding the final numbers in Dayot Upamecano’s recent contract extension, there are rumors that the Bavarians might have been pushed to their limit — and might not be willing to extend themselves much more moving forward.\n\nThere is a perception that Bayern Munich “lost” its negotiations with Upamecano, Jamal Musiala, Alphonso Davies, and Joshua Kimmich. While that is subjective, there could be financial restraints in place to attempt to limit the salary budget getting too wild.\n\nClearly, the Laimer talks will be something for fans to monitor moving forward.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nComment on articles, community posts",

    "fullText": "Durable Endpoints let you build or transform your API into fault-tolerant endpoints simply by wrapping your critical logic into durable steps.\n\nDurable Endpoints behave like normal endpoints. The mental model stays the same: request, response. But each step brings you tracing, observability, and retry logic from the point of failure.\n\nDurable Endpoints are available in the TypeScript and Go SDKs.\n\nYou have endpoints that fail partway through. Any endpoint with multiple steps where failure at step 3 means steps 1 and 2 were wasted work. Instead of writing try/catch logic everywhere or hoping for the best, simply wrap your code in steps and let failures resume from where they left off.\n\nYou want observability without the setup. If you want visibility into your endpoints without configuring a bunch of external services, Durable Endpoints give you that instantly.\n\nYou're already using Inngest. You can add durability to other endpoints without refactoring everything into a workflow or thinking heavily about event logic.\n\nIf you have a traditional endpoint:\n\nThen, wrap your API endpoint with inngest.endpoint and move your endpoint's critical logic into step.run blocks:\n\nIf process fails, the endpoint will retry from that step. enrich-data won't re-run.\n\nRead the Durable Endpoint TypeScript SDK Reference for more detailed usage information.\n\nDurable Endpoints support all the same step methods as Inngest functions. See the Steps documentation for the full reference:\n\nDurable Endpoints behave like regular API endpoints on the success path. You can request them from your front-end (or back-end) using fetch() or your favorite query or http library:\n\nHowever, when a failure triggers retries, a Durable Endpoint returns a redirect to a dedicated endpoint on Inngest Cloud to poll the final result.\n\nHere is a snippet handling both the direct result and the redirected result after retries:\n\nAs the Durable Endpoint redirects the request to a dedicated endpoint on Inngest's Cloud, fetch() cannot simply follow this redirect for you (CORS policy).\nInstead, you need to get the redirect URL (res.url) and trigger a new fetch() request.\n\nDurable Endpoints is currently in beta. The following limitations apply:\n\nThe Durable Endpoints example page provides practical pattern examples such as parallel steps.\n\nThe following demos are also available to check out and run locally with the Inngest Dev Server:\n\nClone this example locally to run it and explore the full source code.\n\nExplore a more advanced example with a DeepResearch interface entirely built with Durable Endpoints.",

    "description": "The agreement, which still faces legal hurdles, would cover current and future claims that the weedkiller caused non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.",
    "fullText": "Bayer, the German pharmaceutical and biotech giant, said Tuesday that it had reached an agreement that would pay plaintiffs $7.25 billion to settle tens of thousands of lawsuits that claimed the weedkiller Roundup caused non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.\n\nThe agreement was submitted to a Missouri circuit court judge in St. Louis, and approval is not guaranteed. A $10 billion settlement unraveled in 2020 after a judge objected to how future claims would be handled.\n\nThe latest deal would cover both current and future claims, and create a fund that Bayer would pay into over the next 17 to 21 years, according to a company statement.\n\nBayer executives hailed the agreement as a significant step in the company’s efforts to control costs from litigation against Roundup, which Monsanto developed in the 1970s. Bayer acquired Monsanto in 2016. Since then, the company has set aside $10 billion to settle lawsuits over the herbicide. With this settlement, Bayer’s legal costs would approach $14 billion in total, according to Bayer’s statement.\n\nBill Anderson, Bayer’s chief executive, previously said the company would stop manufacturing Roundup, which farmers around the world use to kill weeds and increase crop yields, if it couldn’t find a way to end the lawsuits.\n\n“Today marks an important milestone for the company,” Mr. Anderson said on a call announcing the settlement. Shares of Bayer rose more than 7 percent after the announcement.\n\nA major factor in driving the settlement is an upcoming Supreme Court case that will decide whether federal law shields Bayer from many Roundup-related lawsuits.\n\nMost of the lawsuits against Bayer have been filed in state courts, arguing that the company violated state labeling laws because it did not warn users that Roundup could cause cancer. Bayer argues that the Environmental Protection Agency has found Roundup to be safe and that, according to federal labeling standards, it should be protected from the more than 40,000 active lawsuits, of 170,000 total, that have been filed against the company.\n\nEnsuring that those suing received some compensation before the Supreme Court ruling was paramount. “If Monsanto prevails, many claims nationwide would be dismissed or curtailed,” said Christopher Seeger, one of the plaintiffs’ lawyers.\n\nIf the settlement is approved, it will not be affected by the outcome of the Supreme Court case.\n\nMr. Anderson, the Bayer chief executive, said the settlement “complements” the Supreme Court case, even though many of the cases that Bayer is settling could be invalidated if the justices rule in its favor. He said this agreement and a Supreme Court win would provide “the tightest possible form of containment” of litigation, by settling existing cases and making future cases easier to win.\n\nBayer has played legal Whac-a-Mole since it acquired Monsanto, settling tens of thousands of suits against Roundup before reaching a trial. But a number have gone to trial and resulted in verdicts of hundreds of millions of dollars for a single case. Many of those awards have been reduced on appeal.",

That’s no good.\n\nTurns out that most of this was AI bots scrapping in foolish and terribly inefficient ways. This had now moved into new frustrating territory that I had not had to deal with to date. As no doubt you have read as I have, many larger sites and projects deal with this, at times taking large network-layer actions with service providers. I am not to this stage by any means, but I could and should offer up some defense.\n\nTo get started, I poked around the open source chatter around the topic and landed on ai.robots.txt project. The project appeared to be doing a reasonable and thankless job of keeping a running list of AI crawlers along with the various configs one needs for various web servers. While the robots.txt would work fine, I did want a server-level filter, so I wrote a small script to pull the list for my tiny python filter as part for my server.\n\nIn practice it looks like this in the logs, just logging the ol' bots it finds.\n\nAs you an see above that bot in particular was quite annoying. Their documentation—which I will not link to—states that it’s only supposed to send one request every three seconds—it does not—while respecting robots.txt—it clearly does not.\n\nAs such I did add a for-the-love-of-god-stop output that writes back a lone string to said detected bots in attempt to stop them. Some bots comply in my limited testing, but if I have to begin using magic strings to further snap-back at them, I’ll change this output. In some total, I see around 30-ish AI related bots being handed those commands, more than I expected.\n\nLike so many people, I just did not want to have to deal with any of this.

That's like having an essay about why ice cream sells better in the summer without mentioning temperature.\n\nOn the IQ thing -- I don't think the fact firms don't explicitly test for intelligence doesn't mean they aren't trying to measure it with degrees. I reviewed the literature on IQ and productivity, and I inevitably had to answer why firms didn't use IQ testing if it was effective. My answers:\n\n- Sometimes it doesn't make sense to do so, if the job is unskilled, or if the skill is highly legible -- like in musicians.\n\n- About 40% of the American population either doesn't think IQ tests measure intelligence well, or are not sure whether they do. Even if incentives are aligned, many managers, executives, and founders may choose not to select based on IQ.\n\n- Beyond being controverisal, IQ tests are gauche; stigmatised on grounds of being racist, classist, and ageist. They assign people a single number that is assumed to measure intelligence, something considered to be innate and valuable, a dynamic which creates resentment.\n\n- IQ tests are also boring, cold, and lazy. Some peope might choose to do reviews or holistic evaluations because they feel better, even if they don't have the same cash out.\n\nSo there is no need to explain why firms don't use IQ testing in the signalling model of education. I do, however, think that alternative theories (social, ability signalling) are drowned out in the academic debate. Ability-confounding in particular is also underrated and underdiscussed as an explanation for the education~earnings association, with at least 50% of the variance being explained by that alone.\n\nRegarding models for education returns, a different question: if university didn't pay, would people still go?\n\nI think some people definitely would. Not as many as there are right now, but it gives people an opportunity to regularly see people their age, of both sexes, who are highly intelligent. It makes learning easier, extends childhood, and gives people a sense of direction and credibility.\n\nhttps://www.technotheoria.org/p/does-selecting-employees-for-iq-work\n\nhttps://www.technotheoria.org/p/why-does-everybody-hate-the-white",

    "description": "An interdisciplinary collaboration has developed a way to 3D-print concrete underwater – a technique that could transform on-site maritime construction and the repair of critical infrastructure.",
    "fullText": "Since it was invented in the 1980s, 3D printing has moved from the laboratory to the factory, the home and even outer space.\n\nNow, an interdisciplinary group of Cornell researchers is developing a way to bring the technology to the ocean. By 3D-printing concrete underwater, the new approach could transform on-site maritime construction and the repair of critical infrastructure that connects continents.\n\n“We want to be constructing without being disruptive,” said Sriramya Nair, assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering in the David A. Duffield College of Engineering, who leads the effort. “If you have a remotely operated underwater vehicle that shows up on site with minimal disturbance to the ocean, then there is a way to build smarter and not continue the same practices that we do on the land.”\n\nThe project got its start in fall 2024, when the Department of Defense’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) issued a call for proposals to design 3D-printable concrete that could be deposited at a depth of several meters underwater – and to do so in a radically truncated timeframe of one year.\n\n“When the call for proposals came out, we said, ‘Hey, let’s just do this and see, so that we will at least understand what the challenges are,” said Nair, whose group had already been working with a roughly 6,000-pound industrial robot to 3D-print large-scale concrete structures. “And it turned out, with our mixture we could actually 3D-print underwater by making adjustments to account for continuous water exposure.”\n\nIn May 2025, the team was awarded a one-year, $1.4 million grant that is contingent on meeting certain benchmarks, with five other teams competing to do the same.\n\nUnderwater printing faces numerous challenges. Chief among them is preventing washout, in which cement particles fail to bind together during deposition, weakening the material. The typical solution is introducing admixture chemicals, but these create complications of their own.\n\n“When you add those chemicals, it makes your mixture really viscous, and you can’t pump. So you’re balancing that pumpability with these anti-washout agents,” Nair said. “When it extrudes, even if you don’t have washout, you still want it to be able to hold the shape and bond well with the other layers. There are multiple parameters at play.”\n\nDARPA added one more hurdle: The concrete needed to consist primarily of seafloor sediment and only include a small amount of cement. Incorporating material from the bottom of the ocean would minimize the logistical difficulty of transporting large quantities of cement by ship.\n\nIn September, the Cornell team successfully demonstrated to a group of visiting DARPA officials that they were getting close to meeting the agency’s high sediment target. It was a huge milestone, according to Nair.\n\n“Nobody is doing this right now,” she said. “Nobody takes seafloor sediment and prints with it. This is opening up a lot of opportunities for reimagining what concrete could look like.”\n\nThe complexity of underwater 3D printing requires a range of specialized knowledge, so Nair assembled an interdisciplinary group with two sub-teams, one for material design, the other fabrication. Collaborators include: Nils Napp, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering, Greg McLaskey, associate professor of civil and environmental engineering, and Uli Wiesner, the Spencer T. Olin Professor of Engineering, in materials science and engineering; Jenny Sabin, the Arthur L. and Isabel B. Weisenberger Professor in Architecture in the College of Architecture, Art and Planning; as well as researchers from University of Michigan, Clarkson University and University of Arizona.\n\nThe second phase of the DARPA challenge will culminate in a bake-off of sorts, with multiple teams 3D-printing an arch underwater, in March. For months, Nair’s team has been conducting test prints in a large tub of water – often producing multiple samples every week – in the Bovay Civil Infrastructure Laboratory Complex. The lab setting allows the researchers to closely monitor how the layers are deposited and the strength, shape and texture of each arch. But that kind of tactile assessment is only possible on dry land.\n\n“Let’s say you want to print underwater in the real world – we can’t send somebody down with a scuba suit, right? We have to be able to detect those things and adjust our tool path in real time,” Nair said. “The overall goal is to achieve good print quality, because if you don’t place your material where it needs to be, you’re not going to get the strength you need.”\n\nSo in lieu of scuba divers, the fabrication team set out to design sensors that can track the printing as it occurs. Marine conditions don’t make the process easy.\n\n“The problem is sediment is super fine, and as soon as you stir it up, you can have zero visibility,” said Napp, who specializes in building and programming mechatronic devices that navigate and modify unstructured environments. “We didn’t know how much turbidity – or murkiness – there would be in the water.”\n\nSo Napp’s group designed a control box with multiple sensing systems that can be integrated with the robot arm. This device will be paired with Sabin’s work in robotics to bring greater autonomy and control to underwater concrete printing.\n\nThe DARPA competition’s final demonstration will be held in March, and the team is racing to incorporate the advances made by the fabrication team with those of the materials team to successfully print the arches.\n\nWhile the accelerated pace and high-pressure nature of the competition can be tough on the nerves, the urgency has helped make the team as productive as possible.\n\n“As soon as the grant was awarded, we were all meeting once a week, trying to make progress,” Napp said. “It’s a pretty ambitious timeline, and it’s cool to see so many different areas of expertise coming together quickly and pushing this forward.”",

    "description": "A British AI researcher is seeking $1 billion in what would be Europe's largest-ever seed round to develop superhuman artificial intelligence capabilities.\"",
    "fullText": "Quick Answer: David Silver, the British AI researcher who led the creation of AlphaGo at Google DeepMind, is raising $1 billion for his London-based startup Ineffable Intelligence in what would be Europe’s largest seed round ever. Led by Sequoia Capital at a $4 billion pre-money valuation, the round has also attracted interest from Nvidia, Google and Microsoft. Silver believes large language models cannot achieve superintelligence and is betting on reinforcement learning — AI that teaches itself from scratch rather than learning from human data.\n\nDavid Silver built the system that beat the best Go player on Earth. Now he wants to build the system that outthinks every human on every task. And he has persuaded some of the world’s most influential investors to fund the attempt.\n\nSilver, one of Britain’s most celebrated AI researchers, is raising $1 billion for Ineffable Intelligence, a London-based startup he founded after leaving Google DeepMind late last year. The seed round, led by Sequoia Capital, would value the company at approximately $4 billion before the new investment — making it the largest first-round fundraise by a European startup in history, according to PitchBook.\n\nThe daily email on markets, technology, power and money across Europe. Join 10,000+ founders, investors and executives who read EBM every morning.\n\nSequoia partners Alfred Lin and Sonya Huang flew to London to meet Silver personally. Nvidia, Google and Microsoft are also in talks to invest, though negotiations remain live and final terms could change.\n\nThe company has no product, no revenue and no public roadmap. What it has is a thesis — and a founder with a track record that makes investors willing to write billion-dollar cheques on conviction alone.\n\nSilver’s core argument is that large language models — the architecture behind ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini and every major AI system in commercial use today — are fundamentally limited. They learn from human-generated data. They can synthesise, summarise and extend what humans have already written or thought. But they cannot, in Silver’s view, discover genuinely new knowledge.\n\nThis is not a marginal critique. It strikes at the foundation of the current AI industry, which has invested hundreds of billions of dollars in scaling transformer-based language models on the assumption that more data and more compute will eventually produce artificial general intelligence.\n\nSilver disagrees. He believes that to reach superintelligence, AI systems will need to discard human knowledge entirely and learn from first principles — through trial, error and self-play, the way AlphaGo learned to play Go by competing against itself millions of times. The result was a system that made moves no human had ever conceived, some of which initially looked like mistakes but turned out to be brilliant.\n\nIneffable Intelligence aims to build what Silver has described as “an endlessly learning superintelligence that self-discovers the foundations of all knowledge.” The approach is rooted in reinforcement learning — the branch of AI Silver has spent his entire career advancing.\n\nSilver was one of DeepMind’s first employees when the company was founded in 2010. He led the reinforcement learning group that produced AlphaGo, which defeated world champion Lee Sedol in 2016 in one of the defining moments in AI history. He subsequently led AlphaZero, which mastered chess, Go and shogi from scratch without any human training data, and MuZero, which learned to play Atari games without even being told the rules.\n\nHe holds a doctorate from the University of Alberta, where he studied under Richard Sutton, widely regarded as the father of reinforcement learning. He remains a professor at University College London.\n\nSilver had been on sabbatical from DeepMind in the months before his departure and never formally returned. Ineffable Intelligence was incorporated in November 2025, and Silver was appointed director in January 2026. The company is actively recruiting AI researchers.\n\nSilver is not alone in leaving Big Tech to pursue superintelligence independently. Ilya Sutskever, former chief scientist at OpenAI, founded Safe Superintelligence in 2024 and has raised $3 billion to date at a valuation that reached $32 billion by April 2025 — despite having no product. Jerry Tworek, who helped develop OpenAI’s reasoning models, recently left to found Core Automation.\n\nThe pattern is consistent: elite researchers who believe the current paradigm has limits are leaving to explore alternatives, and capital is following them at extraordinary speed and scale. Investors are effectively pricing in the possibility that the next breakthrough in AI will not come from making GPT-5 bigger, but from rethinking the approach entirely.\n\nIf the round closes at $1 billion, Ineffable Intelligence would instantly become one of the most valuable AI startups in Europe — and a powerful signal that London remains capable of producing world-class AI companies, not just world-class AI researchers who leave for San Francisco.\n\nThe deal also underscores a broader shift in how deep-tech companies are funded. A decade ago, a $1 billion seed round would have been inconceivable. Today, in the race to superintelligence, it reflects the market’s belief that the right founder with the right thesis is worth more than a finished product.\n\nSilver built the machine that changed how the world thought about AI. Now he is betting his career — and $1 billion of other people’s money — on the idea that the industry’s dominant approach will not be enough. If he is right, the implications extend far beyond London.",

    "fullText": "Securely integrate AI agents and MCP servers, all in real time\n\nOver the past year, there has been a revolution in the enterprise adoption of agentic systems. In early 2025, executives still had significant doubts, capped off by the MIT NANDA paper, which cited that only 5% of enterprise AI projects were in production. This became widely misquoted as “95% of generative AI pilots are failing,” or “fail to deliver ROI.” Yet by the dawn of 2026 the evidence was quite the opposite: Google reported in September, “74% of executives report achieving ROI their first year.” In fact, 39% of executives had already deployed more than 10 agents across their enterprises.\n\nEven highly-skeptical developers could see marked gains in their own productivity. What was dismissed as a distraction in 2020 is now ready-for-use in 2026. As CoreWeave’s CEO Michael Intrator stated, 2026 is “The Year AI Gets to Work.”\n\nNow, everyone from engineering to marketing wants AI-based tools in production. They want them to have direct read-write access to enterprise data, which further elevates the stakes. It requires running at scale. Reliably. Securely.\n\nThis is why the enterprise agentic AI market is struggling while consumer AI flourishes. Building an agent is remarkably easy. Running one safely with access to sensitive corporate systems and data remains hard. Redpanda is focused on bringing control to the connectivity layer. Rather than configuring access policies individually at each data source, enterprises need a central point through which all agent interactions flow: an agentic data plane.\n\nThat is why we built Redpanda Agentic Data Plane (ADP): so you can achieve your scalability goals and time-to-market with agentic systems, while meeting your ROI and staying within your token budgets.\n\nWatch our Founder and CEO, Alexander Gallego, talk to NYSE about what we’re delivering with Redpanda ADP.\n\nWe announced Redpanda ADP back in October of last year. You can read more about our vision in the related article. It’s a unified, governed access layer that connects all your data systems and mediates every agentic interaction.\n\nRedpanda ADP safely exposes enterprise data to AI agents. It combines:\n\nRedpanda ADP is now available for approved Redpanda Design Partners. Design Partners can work with the Redpanda team to develop solutions built on the Redpanda Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC) offering on AWS. Other cloud providers (GCP, Azure) will be available soon, as will Self-Managed and Serverless deployments.\n\nRedpanda ADP builds on the core of Redpanda’s Kafka®-compatible data streaming service, with a number of unique elements:\n\nRedpanda AI Gateway is a unified access layer that sits between your applications and the LLM or MCP services they use. It provides centralized routing, policy enforcement, cost management, and observability for all your AI traffic. Users can also specify token budgets and spending limits and minimize token consumption through deferred tool loading. Using AI Gateway, users gain control, auditing, and flexibility for complex agentic workflows.\n\nRedpanda AI Gateway also provides a central point to aggregate and manage MCP servers, both local and remote, through an admin-controlled MCP Server Registry. Configuration can be easily set up via YAML, enabling developers to create and deploy agents via text prompts. This enables centralized governance and security for MCP servers. Its JavaScript-based orchestrator reduces round trips needed in multi-step workflows.\n\nRedpanda ADP includes AI agents that can be equipped with tools and given instructions declaratively. They use the industry-standard A2A protocol to accept input and integrate with authorization and observability services. We also provide built-in triggers in Redpanda Connect to hook into pipelines and workflows, with over 300 connectors already available.\n\nRedpanda ADP is built around unified authentication based on OpenID Connect (OIDC). Every resource requires authentication, which can be a user or a service account. Overall, Redpanda ADP has fine-grained access control policies for authorization that can be managed at the organization level or the data plane level.\n\nRedpanda ADP connects to LLMs via the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP), enabling easy collection and analysis of agent transcripts, including comprehensive metrics, logs, and traces of every agent interaction. Not to be confused with audio or video transcripts, agent transcripts provide a holistic record of an agent’s behavior, allowing for both post-facto analysis as well as continuous online performance evaluation and adjustment.\n\nTranscript data can be viewed in our Console to debug and understand what actions your agent took. In addition, you can add your own traces using the new OTLP endpoint in Redpanda Connect. Because Kafka-compatible data streaming is included, you can also easily send all of the traces to an observability platform or to Apache Iceberg tables with Redpanda Connect as well.\n\nThis is just the first set of deliverables for Redpanda Agentic Data Plane. \n\nWe’d love to hear what you’re building with AI. Contact us to let us know how Redpanda can help you create the next generation of data-intensive, AI-fueled applications.\n\nAlso, we’re working on tons more for both Redpanda ADP and our streaming service, so \n\nWe're going \"beyond the cluster\" to standardize streaming for modern enterprises\n\nZero-ops simplicity meets enterprise-grade security to unlock production-ready data streaming for builders\n\nPutting governed agents to work, plus a refreshed onboarding UX\n\nOpt out anytime.",

    "fullText": "Spotlight PA is an independent, nonpartisan, and nonprofit newsroom producing investigative and public-service journalism that holds power to account and drives positive change in Pennsylvania. \n\nHARRISBURG — Late last year, Pennsylvania’s top law enforcement agency revealed taxpayers would pick up the tab for more than $1 million in security upgrades to Gov. Josh Shapiro’s privately owned family home in Montgomery County.\n\nNow those bills are coming due — but the plan to use public dollars for the entirety of the work there has hit a roadblock.\n\nRecords obtained by Spotlight PA show Pennsylvania’s Treasury Department is questioning whether state procurement rules permit public money to be used for construction work on a non-state-owned property like Shapiro’s house.\n\nThe records show that as of late January, employees were asking Pennsylvania State Police, the agency underwriting the upgrades, to provide a “detailed” legal justification.\n\n“How does the location in question constitute being public real property?” they wrote, adding: “Please provide any policies or guidelines related to defining public property to include privately owned residences.”\n\nTreasury spokesperson Steve Chizmar did not elaborate on the agency’s concerns, saying: “We are currently auditing those [bills] and that audit is expected to take several weeks.”\n\nThe Treasury Department is headed by Republican Stacy Garrity, who is seeking the party’s nomination to challenge Shapiro for the governor’s job in November. State revenue is deposited into the Treasury, which uses the money to pay bills for things like contracts and workers.\n\nThe upgrades to Shapiro’s house in Abington were recommended by State Police officials after a middle-of-the-night attack last April on the state-owned governor’s mansion in Harrisburg, where Shapiro and his family stay when in Harrisburg. The Democratic governor and his family and friends were asleep inside, having just finished celebrating Passover the evening before, when a man broke in and set several rooms on fire.\n\nThough no one was harmed, the man who carried out the attack — Cody Balmer of Harrisburg — told law enforcement that had he encountered the governor during the break-in, he would have beaten him with a hammer. He pleaded guilty to attempted murder and other charges.\n\nThe attack set off a top-to-bottom reassessment of security protocols in place for the First Family. State Police hired an outside contractor who recommended changes to protections for the governor, who is guarded by a special State Police unit. The contractor’s report was never made public, but soon after, the state launched extensive security upgrades and repairs at the state-owned governor’s mansion.\n\nState Police also quietly authorized upgrades to Shapiro’s personal home. Those upgrades, which began over the summer, were only publicly disclosed by State Police for the first time in a letter to top lawmakers late last year.\n\nIn an email Tuesday, State Police spokesperson Logan Brouse said that while the state-owned residence was being restored, the Shapiros had to live at their personal residence on a full-time basis — a move that required “serious security enhancements” to the governor’s private home.\n\nThose expenditures, Brouse wrote, were required to carry out the duties of State Police, which include protecting the governor.\n\nState Police determined that making those security enhancements at Shapiro’s private home was the best option, rather than alternative plans such as leasing an alternative property to temporarily house the First Family.\n\nBrouse also said the Treasury Department has paid two invoices related to work at the governor’s private home.\n\nAsked for specifics on those bills, the Shapiro administration provided copies of two invoices for licensing and administrative fees incurred by one of the contractors related to making security upgrades. The invoices don’t specify if the work was for Shapiro’s private home, and they are dated September of last year, a month before State Police disclosed that publicly funded security upgrades were being made there as well.\n\nThe security upgrades at the governor’s family home were carried out under the emergency construction provisions in the state’s procurement code, which lays out the process and (often complicated) steps state agencies must follow to purchase goods and services and execute construction projects.\n\nThe state’s procurement handbook defines emergency construction as “the process of building, altering, improving, or demolishing any public structure or building or other public improvements of any kind to any public real property to remove or correct the basis for the emergency.”\n\nIt is silent on whether private property qualifies for publicly funded emergency construction.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of General Services, which oversees procurement matters, did not immediately respond when asked what section of the emergency procurement code would permit taxpayer dollars to be used for emergency construction at a privately owned structure.\n\nBrouse also did not cite a specific section of the emergency procurement code for the work at Shapiro’s family-owned home. Instead, he said emergency procurements are permitted when there is a threat to public safety.\n\nPublicly funded upgrades to an elected official’s private home or other assets are rare. That’s because the state’s strict ethics rules broadly prohibit public officials from personally benefiting from their positions.\n\nA Shapiro spokesperson told Spotlight PA last year that the governor had consulted with the State Ethics Commission to ensure that there was no improper financial gain.\n\nBut records obtained by the news organization show the governor did not request that guidance until at least two months after construction work for those upgrades began at his Abington house. His spokespeople have not commented on the timing of the opinion.\n\nThe administration did not consult with Treasury officials who are now flagging the expenditures.\n\nAccording to records obtained by Spotlight PA through a public records request, upgrades include $311,230.50 for a security system, $81,043.84 for tree trimming, and $288,736 for landscaping and maintenance involving the exterior grounds.\n\nThe landscaping may end up costing the state even more. The Shapiros and one of their neighbors are locked in a heated court dispute over their property boundaries. The neighbors have sued Shapiro and State Police in federal court, alleging the landscaping work encroaches on their land. The Shapiros have countersued in Montgomery County’s Court of Common Pleas.\n\nAsked who is paying Shapiro’s legal bills, spokesperson Will Simons said the governor is paying out of pocket for his lawsuit. Meanwhile, the governor’s Office of General Counsel is representing him and State Police in federal court (in that lawsuit, Shapiro is being sued both personally and in his official capacity).\n\nThe work on Shapiro’s private house has also attracted the attention of legislators.\n\nA legislative committee headed by Republican state Sen. Jarrett Coleman of Lehigh County late last year subpoenaed the Shapiro administration for a bevy of records related to the upgrades to the governor’s personal home. Legislative subpoenas are rare, and have become mired in litigation when issued in the past.\n\nColeman’s office said it has received records from the administration and intends to hold a hearing on the matter when the state Senate returns to session in mid-March.\n\nAsked whether he believes the state’s procurement code extends to work on private property, Coleman said: “The state emergency procurement policy is black and white. It limits construction to public property, as it should. The governor’s private residence is not public property.”\n\nHe added: “It appears that these bills can’t be paid and maybe never had a legal basis for the procurement in the first place.”\n\nBEFORE YOU GO… If you learned something from this article, pay it forward and contribute to Spotlight PA at spotlightpa.org/donate.

He has since shown remorse for his actions, she noted, per the BBC.\n\nAccording to The Chronicle, one of the victims suffered a minor infection and is currently receiving therapy following the traumatic incident.\n\nThe second child said they were told the tattoo was temporary and it would come off. They had several injections and blood tests afterwards and suffered \"significant anxiety and distress\" as a result. The third victim was left \"upset and scared\" and is also in need of therapy after the incident, Mallet said, per The Chronicle.\n\n“The children didn't choose to have a permanent tattoo. They were put at risk by you giving them tattoos. They are visibly marked with a permanent reminder of you and this,” said Mallett, per The Chronicle.\n\n\"This was a staggeringly stupid and foolish thing to do and also a very harmful thing to do,” she added.\n\nCoe’s attorney, Brian Hegarty, said that he didn’t intend to cause the victim’s pain. \"He does now appreciate what he did was incredibly stupid and should not have happened,” he said, per the BBC.\n\nWant to keep up with the latest crime coverage? \n\nPEOPLE has contacted the Newcastle Crown Court for comment, but didn't immediately receive a response.",

    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage rates are poised to move even lower, as the 10-year Treasury has fallen nearly 2% over the past week. Stock market jitters are nudging investors into bonds, and as prices rise, yields fall. Zillow, which usually reports lower rates than Freddie Mac, reports the 30-year fixed rate at 5.79% — the lowest in years. The 15-year fixed rate is 5.34%.\n\nSub-6% offers nearly double: Mortgage lenders with the best mortgage rates this week.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nLearn about how mortgage rates are determined.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how various interest rates and loan amounts will affect your monthly payments. It also shows how the term length plays into things.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders. You even have the option to enter costs for private mortgage insurance (PMI) and homeowners' association dues if those apply to you. These details result in a more accurate monthly payment estimate than if you simply calculated your mortgage principal and interest.\n\nThere are two main advantages to a 30-year fixed mortgage: Your payments are lower, and your monthly payments are predictable.\n\nA 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has relatively low monthly payments because you’re spreading your repayment out over a longer period of time than with, say, a 15-year mortgage. Your payments are predictable because, unlike with an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), your rate isn’t going to change from year to year. Most years, the only things that might affect your monthly payment are any changes to your homeowners insurance or property taxes.\n\nThe main disadvantage of 30-year fixed mortgage rates is the mortgage interest, both in the short and long term.\n\nA 30-year fixed-term loan comes with a higher rate than a shorter fixed-term loan. You’ll also pay much \n\nThe pros and cons of 15-year fixed mortgage rates are essentially swapped with those of 30-year rates. Yes, your monthly payments will still be predictable, but another advantage is that shorter terms come with lower interest rates. Not to mention, you’ll pay off your mortgage 15 years sooner. So you’ll save potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest over the course of your loan.\n\nHowever, because you’re paying off the same amount in half the time, your monthly payments will be higher than if you choose a 30-year term.\n\nDetermine whether to get a 15-year vs. 30-year mortgage.\n\nAdjustable-rate mortgages lock in your rate for a predetermined period, then adjust it periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years and then goes up or down once per year for the remaining 25 years.\n\nThe main advantage is that the introductory rate is usually lower than what you’ll get with a 30-year fixed rate, so your monthly payments will be lower. (Current average rates don't reflect this, though — fixed rates are actually lower, according to Zillow data. Talk to your lender before deciding between a fixed or adjustable rate.)\n\nWith an ARM, you have no idea what mortgage rates will be like once the intro-rate period ends, so you risk your rate increasing later. This could ultimately end up costing more, and your monthly payments are unpredictable from year to year.\n\nBut if you plan to move before the intro-rate period is over, you could reap the benefits of a low rate without risking a rate increase down the road.\n\nRead about the differences between adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgages.\n\nThe national average 30-year mortgage rate is 5.79% right now, according to data compiled from the Zillow lender marketplace. But keep in mind that averages can vary depending on where you live. For example, mortgage rates vary by state, and if you're buying in a city with a high cost of living, rates could be higher.\n\nYes, mortgage rates are dropping for various reasons. The stock market has been suffering volatility, apparently tied to AI concerns. Tech stocks have been taking the most pain. There has also been growing concern that the Federal Reserve will delay the next interest rate cut to June. When buyers turn to the bond market, yields fall as prices rise.\n\nIn many ways, securing a low mortgage refinance rate is similar to when you bought your home. Try to improve your credit score and lower your debt-to-income ratio (DTI). Refinancing into a shorter term will also land you a lower rate, though your monthly mortgage payments will be higher.\n\nIf you want to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025, you're in luck. It may be a good time. Learn the steps to take to refi in the next couple of months.\n\nMortgage rates inched lower this week as an upbeat jobs report bumped the bond market slightly higher.\n\nChase Home Loans is offering a \"refinancing rate sale\" for rate-and-term and cash-out refinancing. Learn how to qualify for this limited-time rate discount.\n\nTo refinance your mortgage, you need a certain amount of home equity. The rules vary by loan type and refi program. Learn how much equity you need to refinance.\n\nMortgage rates are down, so refinancing soon could be a good idea. Here's what you should know if you want to refinance your mortgage loan in early 2026.\n\nYou can get a low-cost refinance by shopping for mortgage lenders or boosting your credit score.

    "fullText": "After winning a gold medal at the 2026 Winter Olympics, photographers zeroed in on U.S. figure skater Alyssa Liu’s teeth - and the silver spikes that appeared to hover over them.\n\nThe 20-year-old athlete, from California, has what’s called a frenulum or “smiley” piercing, one that pierces the skin connecting the gums to the upper lip.\n\nLiu did the piercing herself, she explained in an interview before the games.\n\nBut while the body jewelry may look cool, experts warn getting these piercings come with a risk of infection and can damage oral health.\n\nMouth piercings are particularly risky because of the millions of bacteria that live in our mouths, according to Colgate. “There's a greater risk of infection when you pierce the inside of your mouth versus getting your ears pierced because of the bacteria,” the mouth care brand says.\n\nInfections can easily develop following oral piercings if the jewelry and surrounding areas are improperly cleaned or touched with dirty hands.\n\nInfection can lead to gum disease that causes teeth to fall out, and inflammation that may result in irreversible receding gums, exposing the sensitive roots of the teeth.\n\nIn much rarer cases, people can also develop Hepatitis B, C, D, E and G, oral hygiene brands Crest and Oral B note. They may also be infected with tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, fungal and bacterial infections like candidiasis and cellulitis or even the heart valve infection, endocarditis.\n\n“Smiley piercings are done on a very sensitive area, and it requires adequate care; otherwise, it can lead to infection and cause adverse effects,” Rodeo Dental Care cautions.\n\nThese piercings can bring about other issues for the teeth and mouth. Piercings can lead to swelling, bleeding, bruising, nerve damage, inflammation and traumatized tissue around the piercing site. They can even impact taste and saliva production.\n\nThe metal piercing can harm teeth over time, as well, because of its near-constant movement in the mouth.\n\nIt can bump and scratch the teeth, resulting in enamel erosion and cracked or chipped teeth. Enamel protects against tooth decay, and it wears away over time.\n\nAll of these risks are why it’s important not to “DIY” your piercings, dentists say.\n\n“After understanding the risks, if you still decide to get an oral piercing make sure the procedure is performed by a trained professional who uses sterile instruments,” advises cosmetic dentist Dr. Edward Liu. “Consult with your dentist before getting an oral piercing to learn proper aftercare and maintenance that will help you reduce your risk of infection or complication.”",

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY — Gov. Kevin Stitt applauded an Oklahoma City-area school district for suspending 122 students who staged a walkout against federal immigration enforcement tactics earlier this month.\n\n“Young Oklahomans: Free speech is sacred, but truancy robs your future. Stay in school, build skills, and make your voice heard responsibly,” Stitt, a Republican, posted on social media.\n\nMustang Public Schools confirmed Wednesday it assigned in-school suspension to students for committing unexcused absences during the walkout, not for the content of their speech. High school students across the state, including in Mustang, have walked out of class this month to hold protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s controversial mass deportation effort.\n\nThe walkouts have drawn criticism from some Republican legislators, who complained not only of student truancy but that the demonstrations were “politically charged.” They called for teaching licenses to be revoked from any educators involved in organizing the protests.\n\nState Superintendent Lindel Fields and Stitt’s education secretary, Dan Hamlin, said they found no evidence that school staff helped plan any of the demonstrations.\n\nSocial media claims of adult involvement in Mustang’s Feb. 5 walkout weren’t found to be credible, either, district leadership said. The walkout was student-led, and those involved were punished according to district policies.\n\nTruancy in Mustang schools is punishable by detention, suspension or other consequences, according to the district’s discipline manual.\n\n“Student safety remains our highest priority, and our decisions were made with that responsibility in mind,” the district stated.\n\nIn a joint statement last week, Fields and Hamlin said students who leave a school campus without permission should be addressed according to locally adopted policies. Educators present during on-campus demonstrations are “expected to ensure safety and order and not to participate in political advocacy,” they said.\n\n“Our state’s public schools are legally obligated to respect students’ constitutional rights to free speech while also maintaining safe and orderly learning environments for all students,” Fields and Hamlin said.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\nSUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",

    "fullText": "A barrage of helicopters flying low over the north-end of Hilton Head over the past week has been disturbing the peace for some residents.\n\nPort Royal Plantation resident Chris Garmston told The Packet the noise started early last week and has persisted daily, except for Sunday. Every 20 minutes, from about 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., Garmston said, he and his wife have heard a helicopter flying low over their neighborhood.\n\nThe Hilton Head resident of 30 years called the noise “irritating.”\n\n“We’re used to living in this lovely, peaceful island,” Garmston said. “It was just noisy and irritating.”\n\nPort Royal Plantation is close to the Hilton Head Island Airport, where commercial airplanes take off and land daily. Garmston said he’s used to the sound of planes coming and going, but they’re not as disruptive, since they’re typically “one and done” and don’t fly directly overhead his neighborhood.\n\nGarmston said residents didn’t initially receive any kind of notice about the noise and helicopters. But in a Facebook post Sunday evening, the Hilton Head Island Airport shared the reason for the noise.\n\nAccording to the post, the U.S. Navy is conducting helicopter training that is expected to continue through the end of the week.\n\n“Crews are doing their best to avoid noise-sensitive areas while following required training procedures,” the airport wrote on Facebook.\n\nCalls and emails from The Packet to Beaufort County Airports Director Jon Rembold and Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort were unsuccessful Tuesday morning.\n\nGarmston provided The Packet with an email he received from Ward 6 Council Member Melinda Tunner Tuesday morning. Garmston said he also spoke with Tunner.\n\nAccording to the email, Rembold informed Tunner that the standard protocol is for the training exercises to be executed over the water, but when that airspace is being used, those flights happen over Hilton Head communities. The airport is required to accommodate military activity, Tunner wrote.",

    "description": "The ‘Ain Braq aqueduct, which runs through the Jabal al-Madhbah massif into Petra, was even more sophisticated than scientists previously believed.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nThe ‘Ain Braq aqueduct, which supplied water to ancient Petra, was thought to have only one conduit, or channel, until the recent discovery of a second one.\n\nAlthough most of the lead pipe is no longer present in the conduit, its former extent can be inferred by matching its imprint to still-extant lead pipe fragments in the area.\n\nLong and narrow, this pipe was most likely used as an inverted siphon, with water passing through a header tank before it flowed through to a series of reservoirs.\n\nThe importance of finding water supplies in a harsh desert climate is a central theme in Frank Herbert's classic science-fiction novel Dune (and in its latest film adaptation by Denis Villeneuve). Rising from dusty sands and carved out of red sandstone, Jordan’s ancient city of Petra is reminiscent of the desert landscapes and stone edifices of Herbert's faraway science-fiction desert planet. But Petra already had aqueducts and water systems thousands of years ago that were far ahead of any on fictional Arrakis—so no one in Petra ever needed a stillsuit to survive.\n\nPetra was an urban hub of the ancient world despite its location in a semiarid climate that brought hardly any rain. It stood as the capital of the Nabatean kingdom until it became part of the Roman province of Arabia in the early 2nd century C.E. As an important administrative and trading center, Petra needed water for purposes beyond keeping its people alive. Its hydraulic systems filled baths, kept gardens and agriculture thriving, gushed from a sacred fountain known as a nymphaeum, and filled up basins in temples, sanctuaries, and tombs. Now, on the abandoned city’s southeast edge, archaeologists have discovered that the ‘Ain Braq aqueduct running through the Jabal al-Madhbah massif into Petra was even more sophisticated than they previously believed.\n\nAs part of a 2023 excavation conducted as part of the Urban Development of Ancient Petra project, a research team led by Niklas Jungmann of the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin studied the system that brought water into Petra. These included cisterns, basins, a reservoir with a dam, and the ‘Ain Braq aqueduct. In the course of their research, Jungmann and his team discovered something that the aqueduct had been hiding for millennia. It featured not just one, but two different main conduits that kept water flowing into Petra. Researchers had long known about the first channel lined with terracotta pipes to carry water into the city. What the researchers didn't expect was to unearth the imprint of a second conduit that once held a pressurized lead pipeline supplying water to basins and reservoirs on az-Zantur hill.\n\n“The discovery of numerous water structures on the plateau directly above the rock slopes with the presumed aqueduct channel and the dam, raised broader questions about the engineering and chronology of this area,” Jungmann said in a study recently published in Levant. “As [the existence of a second conduit] was not mentioned in prior research, examining how the aqueduct entered the city became a primary research objective.”\n\nMeasuring roughly 380 feet (116 meters) in length, the newly-discovered pipeline used a welded metal pipe that was made of lead and encased in mortar. Further evidence that the Nabateans used a lead pipe in the second conduit includes its significantly larger diameter compared to the terracotta pipes found in the area, and the regular surface of the imprint it left behind in the underlying stone, as opposed to the irregular surface imprint typical of channels that held terracotta pipes. A later excavation backed this hypothesis when Nabatean conduit blocks were discovered during a survey of the city center. In the hardened mortar was section of lead pipe, whose imprint texture and dimensions matched those of the earlier find and left no more doubts about the overall composition of the aqueduct’s second main conduit.\n\nJungmann concluded that such a long and narrow lead pipe was probably used as an inverted siphon within the ‘Ain Braq aqueduct. It was buried in concrete to transport water beneath the city, bypassing obstacles on the surface. Water in the system would have flowed through a header tank before entering the aqueduct’s two conduits. Previously, one theory posited that the conduit could have taken a detour to supply water to another part of the city before arriving at its destination. However, the conduit was found to head west, probably to reach the reservoirs of az-Zantur hill. A detour would have not even been viable, since only an uninterrupted pipeline that generates enough internal pressure can allow water in a siphon to run from the header tank to the basin or reservoir it was meant to fill.\n\n“Overall, this study underscores the potential for further research into Nabataean water management,” said Jungmann. “While some hypotheses about the aqueduct’s two branches into the city have been proposed above, more fieldwork is required in order to provide a fuller understanding of the distribution system and its evolution over time.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "A new frontrunner has emerged in California’s wide-open race for governor.\n\nConservative commentator Steve Hilton now leads the field with 17%, followed by Democrat Rep. Eric Swalwell and Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco, a Republican, who are tied at 14%, according to an Emerson College Polling/Inside California Politics survey of 1,000 likely voters released Wednesday.\n\nHilton is a former director of strategy for British Prime Minister David Cameron and a current Fox News contributor. He took in roughly $4.1 million in donations in the second half of 2025, according to campaign finance reports cited by CalMatters.\n\nBianco had a one point lead over Hilton and Swalwell in early December.\n\nFormer Rep. Katie Porter has 10% support in the latest poll and billionaire Tom Steyer has 9% – both are Democrats. Importantly, 21% of respondents said they remain undecided.\n\nPollsters noted that since December, support for Hilton and Steyer rose five points, support for Swalwell increased two points and support for Porter dipped by one point.\n\n“The Republican electorate in California is split between Steve Hilton at 38% and Chad Bianco at 37%, while Hilton also picks up a plurality of independent voters at 22%,” said Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling. “Democratic voters have not yet clearly coalesced around one candidate.”\n\nOutside the top tier, San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan has struggled to gain traction since entering the race in late January.\n\n“Maybe its because he got in late, but the enthusiasm for his candidacy is not right now translating into votes,” noted political analyst Matt Klink.\n\nCalifornia’s primary is set for June 2. The two candidates with the most votes, regardless of party, will advance to the November general election to determine who will succeed Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is term-limited.\n\nWith the race in flux, Klink said it is possible California voters could see two Republicans on the November ballot – and no Democrats.\n\n“It is mathematically possible that you could have two Republicans finishing one‑two in the primary,” he said. “That said, I believe the political brains in the Democratic Party will get involved and say we need to make sure we get one of our candidates into the runoff because he or she will likely win the general election.”\n\nThe survey was conducted Feb. 13-14 and carries a margin of error of 3 percentage points.\n\n• The survey found 44% approve of Gov. Newsom’s job performance, while 45% disapprove. That represents a three-point drop in approval and a six-point rise in disapproval since the December Emerson/Inside California Politics poll.\n\n• A majority of voters at 53% say they have considered leaving California because of the state’s cost of living.\n\n• Asked to identify the biggest strain on their household budgets, 28% cited housing, 21% utilities and 17% groceries.\n\n• On immigration policy, 41% prefer the Biden administration’s approach, 38% favor Trump’s and 21% prefer neither.\n\nMarc Sternfield is the Director of Digital Content at KTLA 5, where he oversees digital news strategy, streaming, and social media.

    "fullText": "Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch is having an ‘I told you so’ moment when it comes to President Trump’s tariffs.\n\nAt November’s blockbuster arguments, Gorsuch raised alarm about what he called a “one-way ratchet” of authority from Congress to the president if Trump wins a case that challenges his use of emergency powers to impose duties on a host of countries.\n\n“It’s going to be veto-proof,” Gorsuch warned of Trump’s declared emergencies.\n\n“What president’s ever going to give that power back? A pretty rare president. So how should that inform our view?”\n\nGorsuch’s concern is now in the limelight as the justices prepare to return to the bench to issue opinions on three separate days between now and next Wednesday.\n\nLast week, Trump saw one of the first major pushbacks from Congress on the matter, when six House Republicans joined Democrats in voting 219-211 to repeal Trump’s Canada tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). That measure now heads to the Senate, where four Republicans joined Democrats last year on a similar effort. The new vote only needs a simple majority.\n\nBut even if it gets to Trump’s desk, the revolt is largely symbolic. The bipartisan support for repealing the tariffs falls far short of the two-thirds majority needed in both the House and Senate to override an expected veto.\n\nGorsuch saw it coming — and he wasn’t the only Trump-nominated justice to read the tea leaves back at November’s arguments.\n\n“Let’s say that we adopt your interpretation of the statute,” Justice Amy Coney Barrett told the government. “If Congress said, ‘Whoa, we don’t like that, that gives a president too much authority under IEEPA,’ it’s going to have a very hard time pulling the tariff power out of IEEPA, correct?”\n\nCongress can amend IEEPA at any time to make clear whether the 1977 law does, or does not, authorize Trump’s tariffs. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has expressed no appetite for doing so, leaving the nine justices to parse the nearly half-century-old phrasing that has left global financial markets in suspense for months.\n\n“I think the sentiment is that we allow a little bit more runway for this to be worked out between the executive branch and the judicial branch,” Johnson said last week.\n\nNo one outside the court knows if the tariffs’ opinion is being sent to the printers right now, or if there’s still time for tweaks. When it is released, watch to see if any of the justices take note of the recent developments on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe Trump administration hopes to convince the justices that Congress can, indeed, claw back power from the president. Solicitor General D. John Sauer would like everyone to remember that Congress clubbed together the votes to terminate the massive COVID-19 emergency just a few years ago.\n\n“What the statute reflects is there’s going to be the ability for a sort of political consensus against a declared emergency. Nevertheless, that’s a political discipline,” Sauer said during the tariff arguments.\n\nSpeculation is still running rampant about exactly when the Supreme Court will release the highly anticipated decision. Some 105 days have now passed since oral arguments, longer than other recent expedited cases.\n\nWhen asked about the wait during her book promo on “CBS Mornings” last week, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson didn’t think much of it.  There are “lots of nuanced legal issues” and “it takes a while to write,” she said.\n\n“The court is going through its process of deliberation, and the American people expect for us to be thorough and clear in our determinations, and sometimes that takes time,” Jackson said.\n\nThe fact the junior liberal justice said anything at all was notable, as Supreme Court justices typically steer clear of talking about pending cases. Full stop.\n\nWe’ve got our ears perked up. As the justices return to the bench, the court has signaled it will hand down opinions Friday, Tuesday and next Wednesday.\n\nBettors on prediction markets think it could be coming. After the court scheduled the opinion days, the odds of the tariff decision landing this month jumped from 40 percent to more than 70 percent on Kalshi, a popular prediction market.\n\nSandwiched between two of the opinion day releases is the State of the Union, scheduled for Tuesday evening.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts and several of the other justices typically attend; here’s the list of who has shown up each year. It’s a rare face-to-face moment between the justices and the president, with every move scrutinized.\n\nAs Roberts and the others sat in last year for Trump’s address, they were also sitting on the president’s emergency appeal seeking to freeze foreign aid. The justices released the decision — against Trump — at 8:59 a.m. the next morning.\n\nWelcome to The Gavel, The Hill’s weekly courts newsletter from Ella Lee and Zach Schonfeld. Reach out to us on X (@ByEllaLee, @ZachASchonfeld) or Signal (elee.03, zachschonfeld.48). \n\nJudges get new leeway to defend the courts\n\nFederal judges have been granted new wiggle room to speak out about the importance of the judiciary as threats and attacks on the courts surge.\n\nAn advisory opinion from the Judicial Conference’s Committee on Codes of Conduct affirmed that the ethics code abided by judges allows them to advocate for the rule of law and defend the independence of the courts, including to seek increased judicial security and funding.\n\nThe opinion goes further to say that, in some circumstances, judges may stand up for their peers against unjust attacks.\n\n“Although this Commentary addresses persecution specifically, the Committee believes the Code and its previous advisory opinions leave room, in at least some circumstances, for the measured defense of judicial colleagues from illegitimate forms of criticism and attacks that risk undermining judicial independence or the rule of law, whether or not they rise to the level of persecution,” the opinion reads.\n\nIt makes no reference to any specific assault on the judiciary. But it follows years of tongue-lashing and impeachment threats from Trump and his allies, especially toward judges who rule against the president. At the same time, public trust in the courts has fallen to near-record lows.\n\nIt points to Roberts’s 2024 year-end report as a guidepost, which addressed four detriments to judicial independence: violence, intimidation, disinformation and threats to defy lawfully entered judgments. Roberts has pushed back on Trump’s threats, though he’s also at turns spoken out about Democrats’ rhetoric.\n\nJudges should avoid acting in a manner that detracts from their official duties and impartiality of the court, commenting on the merits of active matters or engaging in certain political activities, the opinion says.\n\nThey also must watch their tone in writing outside the courtroom, avoiding “sensationalism,” and consider where they choose to speak, so as not to create questions about their fairness.\n\n“These general cautions in the Code do not lend themselves well to precise definitions,” the opinion notes, “and even seemingly clear limits permit a variety of exceptions.”\n\nGabe Roth, executive director of Fix the Court, called the opinion a “a strong step forward for ethics and for judicial independence,” suggesting it showed the committee pushing back on Trump.\n\n“Though individuals are not called out by name, this is a strong rebuke of the Trump administration’s ‘war’ on the judiciary and comes one day after Attorney General [Pam] Bondi denounced ‘liberal activist judges’ for taking part in ‘coordinated […] unlawful attack’ against President Trump’s ‘authority,’” he said in a statement Thursday. “Any judge who, in a measured manner, seeks to counter that nonsense would thus be ethically sound.”\n\nAs attacks on the judiciary have escalated, some judges have spoken out anonymously in the press, or in rarer instances, publicly. It’s especially prevalent as threats against judges continue to rise.\n\nIn fiscal 2025, there were 564 threats against judges, according to U.S. Marshals Service data. Since fiscal 2026 began in October, there have already been 176 threats.\n\nWhat to know about the Supreme Court’s new recusal software\n\nMore ethics news landed Tuesday, this time from the Supreme Court.\n\nStarting in March, the justices will use new software to help identify when they should recuse from a case.\n\nIt’s the justices’ latest effort to align themselves with lower federal judges, who have been required to use an automated conflict-screening system for the past two decades.\n\nThe Supreme Court is not bound by lower judges’ code of conduct.\n\nIt has left the justices playing catch up as public scrutiny into their ethics sharpens, spurred by investigations into the justices’ book deals and luxury trips paid for by billionaires.\n\nTwo years ago, the justices responded to mounting pressure by agreeing to a statement of ethical principles.\n\nCritics emphasize it has no enforcement mechanism. It did, however, direct that the court consider adding a new screening software.\n\nTo be clear, the justices have long identified conflicts. Last term, the justices recused more than 80 times in total, according to The Gavel’s docket tracker. And since this term began in October, the recusal count has already surpassed 30.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito is by far the leader, a reflection of his decision to own direct stock holdings in more than two dozen companies. Alito this term has recused more than twice as many times as any of his colleagues.\n\nStill, catching all necessary recusals is a tall task. The court received nearly 4,000 petitions to take up cases last term, many of which involve a complicated web of companies.\n\nJust last month, Alito recused from a battle between Louisiana parishes and major oil companies at the eleventh hour before the arguments. Alito owns stock in ConocoPhillips, which owns a company named in the suit, but that company had insisted it was no longer involved in the case. It turned out not to be true.\n\nAnd in 2024, Gorsuch belatedly stepped aside from another environmental case after pressure from Democrats over his ties to a billionaire that had filed a brief.\n\nRoth, Fix The Court’s executive director, said the more effective change would’ve been for Alito to divest all direct stock holdings. Every other justice does so except for Roberts.\n\n“So although the new rule is a net positive since it comes in service of the full Court’s adoption of conflict-check software, it’s not a major improvement, and it should not have taken 827 days post-Code to implement,” Roth said in a statement.\n\n“That’s especially true since lower court judges have been required to use software-based conflict screening for 20 years, and several justices have been rumored to continue to use it after they were elevated,” he continued.\n\nThe Supreme Court has not publicly demoed its new software. If you’ve seen it, drop us a line.\n\nWhen it launches, litigants must send a list of the stock tickers for companies involved in their case so it can be run through the screening.\n\nKelly’s court win: A federal judge blocked the Pentagon’s efforts to censure Sen. Mark Kelly and lower his retirement rank in the wake of a video in which the senator and other fellow Democrats called on service members to reject unlawful orders.\n\nNY redistricting reaches SCOTUS: Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-N.Y.) urged the Supreme Court to stop her state judiciary from ordering a redraw of her congressional district ahead of the midterms, casting it as unconstitutional.\n\nMN evidence fight: The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) said it was formally notified by the FBI that the bureau will not share any information about its investigation into the death of Alex Pretti.\n\nGateway Tunnel fight: A federal appeals court allowed a judge’s order requiring the Trump administration to resume funding for the Gateway tunnel project connecting New York and New Jersey to take effect.\n\nBenghazi attack prosecution: A man facing federal charges in connection with the 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans pleaded not guilty.\n\nSwift resolution: Taylor Swift filed legal action to block a bedding company from getting a trademark on a logo that says, “Swift Home.” The company soon after withdrew its application. Read the BBC’s report on the dustup.\n\n‘Straight to the source’: As the Supreme Court mulls its tariff decision, Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) visited the National Archives to lay eyes on the constitutional ink that gives Congress the power to collect taxes and duties. “Went straight to the source. The Constitution is clear,” Bacon wrote on social media. The archives staff has a strict prohibition on taking photos of the Constitution, so add that to the list of special privileges you get as a member of Congress.\n\nMr. Wonderful wins defamation suit: A federal judge awarded “Shark Tank” investor Kevin O’Leary $2.83 million in his defamation lawsuit against Ben Armstrong, a famous cryptocurrency influencer known as “BitBoy Crypto.” Armstrong called O’Leary a murderer over a 2019 fatal accident involving his boat, which his wife was driving. She was later cleared of wrongdoing. The judge entered default judgment after Armstrong failed to meet court deadlines.\n\nPetitions to take up cases that the justices are keeping a close eye on.\n\nHere’s a look at four major legal battles that reach the Supreme Court this week. At their closed-door conference Friday, the justices will consider taking them up for next term.\n\nNot all the cases are likely to be granted, but they each are legal battles that have played prominently for years:\n\nTrump’s E. Jean Carroll verdict: President Trump seeks review of the jury’s verdict that found him liable for sexually assaulting writer E. Jean Carroll in the mid-1990s, which Trump denies, and ordered him to pay $5 million. The president says the jury shouldn’t have heard the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape or testimony from other women who have accused Trump of misconduct. He also argues he should’ve been allowed to tell jurors that a Democratic mega-donor was paying Carroll’s legal bills. The case is Trump v. Carroll.\n\nMore guns: For weeks, the court has stalled announcing whether it will hear Second Amendment challenges against AR-15 and high-capacity magazine bans as well as the federal felon-in-possession law. The pileup grows this week. In Fooks v. Maryland and Mancuso v. New York, the court is asked to hear challenges to state felon-in-possession laws. And in National Association for Gun Rights v. Lamont and Grant v. Higgins, it is also being petitioned to hear a challenge to Connecticut’s AR-15 ban.\n\nNRA’s free speech fight: The National Rifle Association (NRA) is at the high court, but not on the Second Amendment. It’s about the First Amendment. In 2024, the justices unanimously ruled the gun rights group can proceed in its free speech fight against a New York regulator. When the case returned to a lower court, it again sided with the regulator. So, the NRA is back. The case is NRA v. Vullo.\n\nFor-profit college settlement: Everglades College wants the Supreme Court to revive its fight against a class action settlement the Biden administration approved, which cancels $7.5 billion in student debt for those who alleged fraud by for-profit colleges. Lower courts ruled the college had no legal standing, meaning no right to sue over the settlement. The case is Everglades College v. McMahon.\n\nDon’t be surprised if additional hearings are scheduled throughout the week. But here’s what we’re watching for now:\n\nMark Zuckerberg is expected to testify in a landmark social media addiction trial in Los Angeles.\n\nNew York’s elections board is due to respond in writing to Rep. Nicole Malliotakis’s (R-N.Y.) Supreme Court emergency application seeking to revive her congressional district.\n\nThe Supreme Court is expected to announce opinions.\n\nA federal magistrate judge in Virginia will hold a hearing to weigh Washington Post reporter Hannah Natanson’s bid for the return of her devices that were seized in an FBI search of her home.\n\nA federal judge in Minnesota is set to hold a status conference in the criminal case of Vance Boelter, the man accused of shooting two state lawmakers and their spouses, killing one of the couples.\n\nThe Supreme Court will announce orders.\n\nThe justices will also hear oral arguments in two cases involving Cuba, over whether the Helms-Burton Act enables Havana Docks to seek compensation from major cruise lines that docked at Havana’s port and whether lawsuits filed under the statute also clear the normal immunity rules for hauling a foreign government into court.\n\nThe Supreme Court is expected to announce opinions.\n\nThe justices will also hear oral arguments over whether judges have authority to excuse the 30-day time limit for defendants to remove a state lawsuit to federal court in exceptional circumstances.\n\nThe full U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is set to hear oral arguments over the Trump administration’s efforts to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nThe full D.C. Circuit is also set to hear oral arguments in the Trump administration’s appeal of an order blocking the Environmental Protection Agency from clawing back billions of dollars in climate spending.\n\nRachel Weiner in Court Watch: The Rabbit Hole: Covering the Courts from a Windowless Office\n\nThe Washington Post’s Peter Whoriskey: Killers without a cause: The rise in nihilistic violent extremism\n\nGreen Matters’s Shreya Patnaik: The Colorado River Now Holds Legal Personhood.

The former model, 55, appeared to take her husband’s joshing seriously, after Donald Trump joked that there was a “movie star” on board Air Force One on Monday evening as they flew from Florida to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. Melania, who used Presidents Day to plug her movie, emerged from the aircraft at the strip before making her way to Marine One for her onward journey. She stepped out alongside her 79-year-old husband, wearing a long coat, leather gloves, long boots and sunglasses—a peculiar choice given that it was pitch-black outside.",

    "fullText": "FCC Chairman Brendan Carr said that the agency “has an enforcement action underway on ABC’s The View after the show featured James Talarico, a Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, as a guest.\n\n“We’re taking a look at it,” Carr told reporters on Wednesday, but he declined to go into specifics. Fox News reported earlier this month that The View was under investigation for potential violation of the Equal Time Rule, which requires broadcasters who feature candidates to provide airtime to rivals if requested.\n\nJames Talarico Raised $2.5 Million After Stephen Colbert Interview Was Shifted From Broadcast To YouTube\n\nStephen Colbert Calls Out CBS, Again, Over Equal-Time Furor, But Says \"I Don't Want An Adversarial Relationship With The Network\"\n\nBruce Springsteen Tour Promises \"An American Spring Of Rock 'N' Rebellion\"\n\nABC has not yet commented. The show also has featured Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX), one of Talarico’s Democratic primary opponents, as a guest.\n\nCarr’s comments follow Stephen Colbert’s show on Monday, when the host said that CBS attorneys declined to allow an interview with Talarico to be broadcast out of concern of triggering the equal time rule.\n\nCBS has disputed Colbert’s account, saying that he was not prohibted from featuring Talarico but “was provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the FCC equal-time rule for two other candidates.” On his show on Tuesday, Colbert said that CBS attorneys had reviewed what he said on the previous night’s program. The interview was posted on YouTube.\n\nTalk shows had previously operated under the assumption that they were exempt from the Equal Time Rule, the same immunity given to news programming.\n\nBut the FCC under Carr last month issued guidance warning talk shows like The View, Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel Live shouldn’t assume that they are exempt when they feature political candidates.\n\nAs the news played out as a major political and media story on Tuesday, Carr said that he was “highly entertained. I think it was one of the most fun days I’ve had in the job watching sort of the hilarity of how this story played out.”\n\nHe added, “Look, anybody that’s not suffering from a terminal case of Trump derangement syndrome could see right away yesterday the exact story arc and how it was going to play out. You had a Democrat candidate who understood the way the news media works, and he took advantage of all of your sortt of prior conceptions to run a hoax, apparently, for the purpose of raising money and getting clicks, and the news media played right into it.”\n\nTalarico’s campaign reported on Wednesday that it had raised $2.5 million since the Colbert interview, a record.\n\nTalarico posted on X a link to the YouTube interview and the message, “This is the interview Donald Trump didn’t want you to see. His FCC refused to air my interview with Stephen Colbert. Trump is worried we’re about to flip Texas.” In fact, it was CBS and/or Colbert’s show that made the decision about the interview.\n\nCarr also based the media for its coverage of the incident, calling it a “perfect encapsulation of why the American people have more trust in gas station sushi than they do in the national news media. This was plainly an effort ginned up to get clicks and raise money, and you guys ate it up.”\n\nIn its guidance last month on the Equal Time Rule, the FCC said that in considering whether a show is exempt, they would take into account whether a talk show’s featuring of a political candidate is “motivated by partisan purposes.” Carr said that a host’s political donations to candidates could be one of the factors considered. Colbert has hosted fundraisers for presidential candidates, and Kimmel is headlining an event next month for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\nAnna Gomez, the sole Democrat on the commission, characterized the Colbert incident as another example of the FCC using its enforcement power to punish broadcasters for speech the Trump administration doesn’t like.\n\n“I do think that the threats are the point, the harassment is the point, because the commission is not going to survive appeal if it actually takes action against these broadcasters, because what it is doing is a violation of the First Amendment,” she said.\n\nAll The Songs In ‘Shrinking’ Season 3 So Far: From Role Model To The Rolling Stones\n\nThe 60 Movies That Have Made More Than $1 Billion At The Global Box Office\n\nThe 25 Highest-Grossing Animated Films Of All Time At The Global Box Office",

    "fullText": "We all know one – and there’s a good chance you fall into the category yourself. Here’s how to recognise if you’re a ‘walking, talking red flag’ …\n\nAge: The term circulated this month, but the behaviour has been escalating across digital communication for some time.\n\nAppearance: Someone you know well enough to share a group chat with.\n\nWho?! You tell me. A “finger princess” is the person in the group chat who asks questions that they could easily answer themselves.\n\nOh, I know exactly who that is. Yes, everyone knows at least one: “What time are we meeting tonight?” “What’s the best way to get there?” “Am I bringing the pasta salad?”\n\nWhy don’t they just scroll up through earlier messages? Or Google it? Well, that’s the question. It’s just as much effort for you to find the info as it is for them.\n\nSo they’re just being lazy? They might not think so, but the name jokes that they’re too precious to lift a finger to make a simple search.\n\nWhere did it come from? Korea, originally – “finger princess” is a direct translation of “ping-peu”.\n\nIt’s not only women, surely? No, you can also be a “finger prince”.\n\nVery modern. So who do we have to thank for bringing this to our attention? It was shared by a Korean slang account on Instagram, then picked up by digital media sites like Self and Slate.\n\nWhat do they have to say about it? Well, Self says it’s a “friendship red flag”.\n\nAh, another one of those. Sure, it’s annoying, but is it really all that bad? The odd question, of course not, but if it’s a pattern, it may suggest a sense of entitlement. “They’re used to others doing things for them,” a counsellor told Self.\n\nThey only asked for the address to the restaurant! Yes, but if it takes you just as long to look it up as it does them, then they’re outsourcing emotional labour, you see.\n\nWhat if they want advice, or a personal recommendation? That’s different. This is about adults who wilfully refuse to take initiative.\n\nHas anyone bravely owned up to being one of these deadweight friends? Yes. An Australian blogger confessed to being one, and described to her group chat for help with a power outage as a “humbling reality check”: “I am a walking, talking red flag.”\n\nIn fairness, that sounds like it might be a job for a qualified electrician. Well, you could argue that this whole issue stems from the immediacy of digital communication, making it easy to fire off texts without thinking. Instead of finger-pointing at our finger-princess friends, we could probably all stand to be a bit more mindful of what we’re asking of others.\n\nExactly! Don’t people like to feel useful, anyway? That sounds like something a finger princess would say.\n\nDon’t say: “Here is the pdf menu you requested, Your Royal Highness.”\n\nDo say: “Let me Google that for you.”",

    "fullText": "Australia experienced a boom in smart-home technology at the start of the 2020s. Years on, some early adopters are experiencing buyer’s remorse\n\nGet our weekend culture and lifestyle email\n\nWhen the smart home devices Elly Bailey was expecting in the post never showed up at her Gold Coast home, she was frustrated. As a technology reviewer, these products were crucial for her work.\n\nWhen she eventually found the cause, she had to laugh. It wasn’t a sticky-fingered neighbour or a rogue delivery driver causing her to miss parcels, but her smart doorbell – the very thing she’d hoped would prevent missed deliveries, and part of exactly the range of internet-connected devices she was meant to be reviewing.\n\n“It’s pretty funny,” says Bailey, 33, who goes by the handle @ellyawesome on TikTok, where she has more than 1.1 million followers. She’d been loving her Google Nest doorbell up until then. She could see who was at the front door from upstairs and speak to delivery people through her phone while she was out.\n\nBut it had one obvious flaw: “When someone presses this doorbell, all it does is send a notification to my phone.” She says this feature is “great” when she’s out, but without a telltale chime she was missing deliveries while at home and away from her phone. She complained about this to her followers in a clip that’s been liked more than 1,400 times.\n\n“The crazy irony is the doorbell itself does make a little ding-dong sound when you press the doorbell button, but it’s only loud enough for the person at the door to hear it,” she says.\n\nBailey is far from alone in her scepticism around smart home technology – many adoptees have realised the devices designed to make life easier regularly achieve the opposite. Stories of people being locked out of their homes by faulty smart locks, woken up by pets activating cameras on the driveway, and being left in the dark by broken smart lights are rife on social media and product review websites.\n\n“Technology is brilliant … until it isn’t,” says Georgina Wilson, an architect in Sydney who learned this the hard way when her husband pressure-hosed the front of the house and accidentally watered their smart keypad unit. The incident hasn’t changed her mind on the convenience of a smart lock, but it did result in an expensive emergency locksmith callout – and quickly forced her to put a backup plan in place: keys in a hidden lockbox, with copies distributed to family members and neighbours.\n\nShe says some of her clients have had similar, or worse, experiences. “We’ve seen clients unable to flush toilets, lock front doors, or exit garages during power outages.”\n\nSince smart home technology uptake spiked during Covid lockdowns, Daniel Vasilevski, an electrician in Sydney, says he’s seen many smart tech horror stories. One client in Maroubra got locked out of their house for two days. Others have ended up with no working lights. Subscription complaints are also rife, with even some relatively simple devices like smart doorbells and thermostats requiring monthly fees. Vasilevski estimates 15 to 20% of his callouts these days are for problems with smart tech – some are simple repair jobs, while others want their smart systems demolished altogether.\n\nThere can be a more sinister side, too. Experts say smart homes are prime targets for cybercriminals. More than 120,000 smart home cameras were hacked in South Korea last year and the Australian Signals Directorate recently warned that Chinese hackers are exploiting people’s home routers and smart devices.\n\nWhile cases of spying fridges and doorbells being hacked are still rare, Emily Holyoake, a cyber and home-security expert based in Canberra, says technology facilitated domestic abuse is a significant issue.\n\n“The scariest things I’ve heard are about loss of privacy, where ex-partners have still had access to their partner’s home and made changes either locking them out, letting themselves in or watching their every move,” she says.\n\nRenters, too, have privacy concerns, as smart locks can allow landlords to keep tabs on their every move.\n\nJulie Provenzano, a real estate broker with 83,000 TikTok followers, believes it might be smarter to stick with an analogue home. She recently told fans she was “apped-out”. “Hi-tech doesn’t necessarily mean easier … It leaves people in a hostage situation with IT departments,” she said.\n\nVasilevski’s clients have faced similar issues. When something goes wrong, it’s not just the tech that’s a problem, but finding someone to fix it. Many locksmiths are not trained to work with sophisticated, connected devices. He says electricians will sometimes turn away smart home repair jobs because of how faffy and time-consuming they can be to troubleshoot. “It isn’t worth the hassle, most of the time,” he says. This is particularly true with lower-end smart tech suppliers who offer little in the way of after-sale support.\n\nGaby Albutros, a project manager at Sydney firm RSE Home Automation, says that when brands shut down or devices are discontinued, as was the case with Belkin’s Wemo smart home range in January, customers can be left high and dry.“The only option when they go wrong is to have them ripped out.”\n\nCurtains and blinds seem to be among the few smart-control devices that experts in the industry agree upon. Provenzano says they’re one of the only smart devices she endorses, and Vasilevski agrees, saying he wouldn’t install smart tech in his home because of the issues he sees at work, but that “smart control curtains are pretty reliable because they only get used twice a day”.\n\nWhile Holyoake doesn’t suggest eschewing the Internet of Things entirely, she says the key is to be intentional about the technology you’re putting in your home. In her household, she uses smart security cameras, lighting, a robot vacuum and even a digital whiteboard – all things she says make family life easier, especially with neurodivergent kids.\n\nMindful of the risks, she suggests smart-home adopters make time to check their security settings once a month. “Make sure only the people you know and trust have access, always make sure you change the default password, check for security and software updates, and always ask: who has access to my data and where is it stored? Do I need a subscription to access my own data? Can I still access devices if the internet goes out?”\n\nBailey might be a likely champion for all things smart, but even she prefers a hybrid setup. She’s been offered everything from smart lights to smart washing machines as part of her job, so she could have the world’s most connected home if she wanted to, but aside from the smart doorbell – which she’s kept because she still thinks the benefits outweigh the drawbacks – she’s chosen to keep most parts of her home “consciously dumb”.\n\n“Ultimately I’m an old-school millennial who’s very happy to put my washing on myself,” she says. “I think that keeps me smart, to be honest.”",

    "description": "Top computer models don't agree about the forecast, but some are suggesting it could be another major snowstorm in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast.",
    "fullText": "Editor's note: Follow the latest forecast developments in USA TODAY's coverage for Wednesday, February 18.\n\nIt might head out to sea, or it might be a 'blockbuster\" late-weekend blizzard for the East Coast.\n\nAs of the afternoon of Feb. 17, top computer models continue to pore through weather data to determine the direction and strength of a storm that's still several days away from the East Coast. At the moment, the models don't agree.\n\n\"While confidence in a storm is fairly high, the timing, track, and exact ... weather impacts remain highly uncertain,\" the National Weather Service said in an online forecast discussion posted Feb. 17 at 2:29 p.m EST.\n\nThe weather service said that the latest European weather model shows a \"farther south track with little to no precipitation for the Mid-Atlantic to the Northeast.\" However another model, the Europeans' AI model known as the EC-AIFS, \"has been consistent in showing a fairly classic nor'easter set up for the region.\"\n\nOne forecaster, Weather Trader meteorologist Ryan Maue, in an email to USA TODAY, said the odds appear to be increasing for a major nor’easter with the potential for \"blockbuster snowfall.\"\n\n\"A major storm is likely to develop out of the Southeast U.S. and emerge off the Mid-Atlantic and either head (1) east out to sea or (2) snuggle up nicely off New England,\" resulting in snow along the I-95 corridor, Maue said.\n\nHe said the models should come into agreement by Feb. 18. \"This system is in the 5- to 6-day time frame, so predictability of the track should be pretty good into tomorrow [Feb. 18] — meaning we can either lock-in a blizzard or send it off to sea,\" he said, adding that he favors the AI model, which shows the East Coast nor'easter blizzard.\n\nAccording to AccuWeather senior meteorologist Alex Sosnowski, \"a lurking storm for Sunday [Feb. 22] to Monday [Feb. 23] has the potential to bring significant snow to a large area of the northeastern United States, including New York City, Boston and Philadelphia.\"\n\nSosnowski continued in an online forecast, \"a storm still off the coast of British Columbia in the eastern Pacific has the potential to bring more accumulating snow to parts of the Northeast later this weekend. The situation is complicated and is not certain to bring snow to the big cities along the Interstate 95 corridor,\" he said.\n\nThe weather service's mid-afternoon forecast concluded that \"confidence is increasing for a coastal low by Sunday and early Monday, and if that comes to pass, heavy coastal rain and inland snow could be the case from the Mid-Atlantic to New England, and strong winds near the coast with the potential for coastal flooding.\n\n\"The specifics on the strength and track of this low are still uncertain, but will have direct implications on the inland extent and intensity of the precipitation, so stay tuned for later updates on this event.\"\n\nDoyle Rice is a national correspondent for USA TODAY, focusing on weather and climate.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Weekend snowstorm?

    "description": "The Trump administration is disputing a new paper from the New York Federal Reserve that asserts US consumers and businesses are bearing the bulk of the higher costs from tariffs imposed last year.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration is disputing a new paper from the New York Federal Reserve asserting that US consumers and businesses are bearing the bulk of the higher costs from tariffs imposed last year.\n\n\"The paper is an embarrassment,\" National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told CNBC on Wednesday. \"I think it's the worst paper I've ever seen in the history of the Federal Reserve System. The people associated with this paper should presumably be disciplined, because what they've done is they've put out a conclusion, which has created a lot of news that's highly partisan, based on analysis that wouldn't be accepted in a first-semester econ class.\"\n\nWhat percentage of tariff costs did US consumers bear?\n\nHow did the Trump administration respond to the study?\n\nWhat did the NY Fed study find about tariff costs?\n\nHow did tariff pass-through rates change throughout 2025?\n\nAuthors Mary Amiti, head of labor and product markets at the New York Fed's Research and Statistics Group, along with research analyst Chris Flanagan and research economist Sebastian Heise, analyzed the tariffs instituted last year and found that 94% were borne by the US in the first eight months of 2025. Just 6% of those costs were absorbed by foreign exporters.\n\nThe analysis covered 12-month changes from January 2024 through November 2025 (the most recent available data). The analysis also noted how the pass-through of costs changed over the course of 2025. For instance, by November, the pass-through of costs borne in the US had declined to 86%.\n\nThe authors said their results show that a 10% tariff led to only a 0.6 percentage-point decline in foreign export prices. But they also found that the tariff pass-through into import prices declined later last year, as more exporters bore the costs of tariffs. In November, a 10% tariff was associated with a 1.4% decline in foreign export prices, though still an 86% pass-through to US import prices.\n\nThe authors said the higher import prices caused firms to reorganize their supply chains.\n\n\"In sum, U.S. firms and consumers continue to bear the bulk of the economic burden of the high tariffs imposed in 2025,\" the authors wrote.\n\nHassett maintains that tariffs affect a multitude of price factors, including supply and demand, which shift around consumer and producer surpluses.\n\n\"They’re basically only looking at changes in prices,\" Hassett said.\n\nHe pointed to other metrics, such as lower inflation and higher wages, which suggest consumers are better off.\n\n\"Incomes are up way more than the cost of living, and that's the real wage gain that this silly Fed study neglects to mention,\" Hassett said.",

    "fullText": "The trans suspect who opened fire at a Rhode Island ice hockey rink on Monday killed his ex-wife and adult son, authorities said, while his daughter alleged he had a \"vendetta\" against the family.\n\nRobert Dorgan, 56, fatally shot his ex-wife, Rhonda Dorgan, at the Dennis M. Lynch Arena in Pawtucket as well as his son Aidan Dorgan, who later died at the hospital, North Providence Mayor Charles Lombardi said, according to WCVB.\n\nThree other victims were injured in the shooting, including Linda and Gerald Dorgan, who were the parents of Rhonda Dorgan. Both Linda and Gerald are currently hospitalized in critical condition, according to the outlet.\n\nRhode Island Ice Rink Shooting Suspect's Gender Identity Was Source Of Past Family Conflict: Docs\n\nThe third victim was identified as Thomas Geruso, a friend of the Dorgan family, who is also in critical condition.\n\nThe shooter, who identified as transgender, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said.\n\n\"I just want to make sure people understand this was one person’s vendetta against their family,\" Amanda Wallace-Hubbard, Dorgan’s daughter, told WPRI-TV. \"We were targeted. This was very specific. It wasn’t random.\"\n\nWallace-Hubbard, Robert Dorgan’s daughter from another relationship, said she was with her two young sons and the rest of the family in the stands when the shooting occurred. She described Rhonda as her stepmother and Aidan as her half-brother.\n\nShe credited an unidentified good Samaritan with saving her life and those of her sons. The individual is seen tackling Robert Dorgan in footage from the shooting, per WPRI-TV.\n\n\"Until that good Samaritan incapacitated him, I really feared that my sons were next,\" Wallace-Hubbard said.\n\n\"I can’t thank him enough,\" she added. \"I’m certain my sons and I are alive because of him.\"\n\nColin Dorgan, the 17-year-old son of Robert and Rhonda Dorgan and a North Providence High School senior, was on the ice playing in the game when the shooting occurred, per WPRI-TV.\n\nVideo from inside the arena shows players diving and fans fleeing their seats as shots rang out during the high school game. At least a dozen shots can be heard in the footage, along with people screaming as they scramble for cover.\n\nPolice have not publicly identified a motive. Pawtucket Police Chief Tina Goncalves described the shooting as a \"family dispute.\"\n\nAn attorney for the Dorgan family said they are \"deeply and profoundly affected\" by the tragedy and are cooperating with authorities.\n\n\"We are reminded that behind every headline is a family experiencing profound pain and loss,\" the statement said, per WCVB, adding that the family is focused on those injured and asking that further questions be directed to their attorney.\n\nWATCH: PLAYERS AND FANS SCRAMBLE FOR COVER AFTER SHOOTING:\n\nInvestigators are continuing to review surveillance footage and witness accounts as they piece together a timeline of the shooting.\n\nCourt records show Robert Dorgan had a documented history of conflict with relatives in recent years, including disputes tied to his gender transition, Wpri reported.\n\nIn 2020, Robert Dorgan reported to North Providence police that he had undergone gender-reassignment surgery and said his father-in-law wanted him out of the family home because of it.\n\nWATCH: PAWTUCKET POLICE RELEASE NEW DETAILS ABOUT RHODE ISLAND HOCKEY SHOOTING\n\nAccording to court documents cited by WPRI, Robert Dorgan alleged his father-in-law used a derogatory term for transgender individuals and threatened retaliation if he did not move out. The father-in-law was charged at the time, though prosecutors later dismissed the case.\n\nCourt filings also show Robert Dorgan’s then-wife initially cited \"gender reassignment surgery, narcissistic + personality disorder traits\" in divorce paperwork before the grounds were amended to \"irreconcilable differences.\"\n\nThe divorce was finalized in 2021. Paperwork from the divorce showed Robert Dorgan lived at the time in Jacksonville, Florida, and was working as a truck driver.\n\nAlso in 2020, Robert Dorgan accused his mother of assaulting him and acting in a \"violent, threatening or tumultuous manner,\" according to police records cited by WPRI. His mother was charged with simple assault and battery and disorderly conduct, though the case was later dismissed, court records show.\n\nThe dispute was also referenced in Robert Dorgan’s conflict with his father-in-law. According to court documents, Dorgan told police his father-in-law \"told me that if I did not drop the assault charges against my mother that further retaliation could be expected and that was another reason to have me killed.\"\n\nThe day before the shooting, Robert Dorgan posted on X about going \"BERSERK\" after an actor insisted that Rep. Sarah McBride, D-Del., is a man.\n\nFox News' Louis Casiano, Alexis McAdams and Bonny Chu contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Feb 18 (Reuters) - An Indian university has been asked to vacate its stall at the country's flagship AI summit after a ‌staff member was caught presenting a commercially available robotic dog made in China ‌as its own creation, two government sources said.\n\n\"You need to meet Orion. This has been developed by the Centre ​of Excellence at Galgotias University,\" Neha Singh, a professor of communications, told state-run broadcaster DD News this week in remarks that have since gone viral.\n\nBut social media users quickly identified the robot as the Unitree Go2, sold by China's Unitree Robotics for about $2,800 and widely used ‌in research and education globally.\n\nThe episode ⁠has drawn sharp criticism and has cast an uncomfortable spotlight on India's artificial intelligence ambitions.\n\nThe embarrassment was amplified by IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, ⁠who shared the video clip on his official social media account before the backlash. The post was later deleted.\n\nBoth Galgotias and Singh have subsequently said the robot was not a university creation ​and ​the university had never claimed otherwise.\n\nThe stall remained ​open to visitors as of Wednesday ‌morning with university officials fielding questions from media about accusations of plagiarism and misrepresentation.\n\nGalgotias has yet to receive any communication about being kicked out from the event, a representative at the booth said.\n\nThe India AI Impact summit at Bharat Mandapam in New Delhi, which runs until Saturday, has been billed as the first major AI gathering hosted in the Global ‌South. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Google's Sundar Pichai, OpenAI's ​Sam Altman and Anthropic's Dario Amodei will address ​the gathering on Thursday.\n\nThe event has also ​faced broader organisational difficulties since opening, with delegates reporting overcrowding and ‌logistical issues.\n\nThat said, there has been more ​than $100 billion of investment ​in India AI projects pledged during the summit, including investments from the Adani Group conglomerate, tech giant Microsoft and data centre firm Yotta.\n\nIndia's biggest opposition party, Congress, ​was amongst those expressing outrage.\n\n\"The ‌Modi government has made a laughing stock of India globally with regard to ​AI,\" it said on social media, citing the robot incident.",

Eight-five passengers and five crew members were on board, according to Delta.\n\n“We had a passenger get up and try to access the cockpit,” the pilot can be heard in a radio recording with air traffic control captured by Broadcastify. “Can you coordinate and have security standing by?”\n\nAfter confirming the cockpit was secure, he requested police and paramedics meet the plane when it landed.\n\n“(He is) in cuffs in the back of the aircraft, but he did assault another passenger, so we would like that other passenger checked out,” the pilot told air traffic control.\n\nIn 2025, there were 1,621 unruly passengers reported to the Federal Aviation Administration. So far, in 2026, there have been 126.\n\nWednesday, the plane signaled an emergency using its transponder and landed back at Hobby Airport about 17 minutes after taking off. Emergency vehicles accompanied the plane to the gate.\n\n“They are coming to the gate. The police are there waiting,” an air traffic controller told emergency responders. “Follow the aircraft to the ramp.”\n\nDelta later told CNN that the passenger “approached crew and customers but did not make contact with or attempt to access the flight deck.”\n\n“The safety of our customers and crew is paramount, and Delta has zero tolerance for unruly behavior,” the airline said in a statement. “We apologize to our customers for this experience and delay in their travels.”\n\nThe flight later took off again and arrived in Atlanta about 90 minutes behind schedule.\n\nThe FAA is investigating the incident.",

    "fullText": "AI's next target? Helping you kick your phone addiction.\n\nAI devices are a top priority for Big Tech companies that view it as the future of how humans and AI interact, writes BI's Amanda Hoover.\n\nYou've likely heard of this hardware before, which acts as a sort of AI sidekick for your life. From the Rabbit R1 and Humane to Friend, the names are different, but the stories are the same: big expectations, difficult execution.\n\nAmanda's story covers how it's not just upstarts looking to shake things up. Tech giants like Apple, Meta, and OpenAI are working on their own solutions.\n\nIt's an uphill battle considering how addicted most of us are to our phones. However, the push for phone-free lifestyles, especially among Gen Z, does create an opening.\n\nThese tech giants also don't have much of a choice.\n\nApple, for example, has largely sat out the AI wars, saving a ton of money on model development. That only works if the iPhone remains a key distribution channel for the AI it's skipping out on developing.\n\nMeta's business is also heavily reliant on smartphone usage. (How often do you check Instagram on your desktop computer? Do you even have a desktop computer?) If user behavior around phones changes in a meaningful way, you can bet Meta wants to be ahead of it.\n\nAI devices also give companies a front-row seat to your life.\n\nYou could argue that's already the case with these AI chatbots. I'd argue the relationship between you and your chatbot of choice is still mostly transactional. You have a question/problem/thought; the chatbot has an answer (hopefully).\n\nThe relationship with AI wearables is more fluid. It's always listening, learning, and collecting. The pitch is that makes it a better copilot. Understanding your habits means it can figure out the best way to serve you.\n\nThat's putting a lot of faith, and your personal data, into an AI device, though\n\nMany executives I've spoken to have said this is the future. Truly leveraging AI is about incorporating it into your daily routine, not treating it as a one-off for specific problems.\n\nThe irony is that strategy has the potential to make AI even more addictive than the smartphones it's trying to replace.",

    "fullText": "Jay-Z, born Shawn Carter, is a big fan of Patek Philippe watches. He wore one with a rose-gold case and dozens of diamonds for the 2025 Grammys.\n\nIts face includes several functions, such as days of the week and moon phases, that help keep a perpetual calendar for tracking the date. The calendar automatically adjusts for leap years and accurately counts the days until 2100, according to GQ.\n\nThe hand-stitched strap is made of alligator leather.\n\nJay-Z quite literally announced his love of Hublot in the 2011 song \"Otis,\" where he pronounced, \"New watch alert: Hublot.\"\n\nPerhaps it was prophetic. In 2012, his wife and fellow artist Beyoncé gifted Jay-Z a $5 million Hublot Big Bang in 18-karat white-gold for his 43rd birthday, according to jewelry blogs.\n\nThe watch was encrusted with 1,282 diamonds, and it took more than 14 months to assemble, the Grand Prix d'Horlogerie de Genève, a foundation that highlights contemporary watches with awards and exhibitions, reported. It also took more than a year to source all the diamonds.\n\nHublot released the Shawn Carter Hublot Classic Fusion in yellow gold and black ceramic in 2013. The former watch was priced at $33,900, and the latter at $17,900.\n\nThe collection was limited to just 350 total pieces, according to GQ.\n\nJay-Z's custom Blueprint Richard Mille 56 watch required more than 3,000 hours to produce, GQ said in 2019. No wonder it cost $2.5 million.\n\nDuring a 2019 show in his hometown of Brooklyn, the rapper freestyled a tribute to the timepiece: \"Blueprint on my wrist cost 2.5/Only thing that flips the script between you and I.\"\n\nWhat was the price of that Richard Mille 56 watch? $3 million, according to Complex. Or at least, that was its retail value. Alex Todd, who customized the watch, told the outlet that its monetary value is higher.\n\nIt was custom-made for Jay-Z and featured rare green sapphire crystals.\n\nHe did so with an RM011 Felipe Massa Chronograph in rose gold. The watch was originally released in 2007 and was designed with its namesake, F1 driver Felipe Massa, the brand said on its website.\n\nThe timepiece is meant to invoke a racing aesthetic and the sport's history of tech innovation. Its crown \"resembles a smooth tyre encircling a spoked wheel rim,\" the maker said.\n\nMille is no longer making this model, but you can get a used one for $215,000.\n\nJay-Z wore the Richard Mille RM027 Rafael Nadal to watch its namesake take on Novak Djokovic at the 2011 US Open championships.\n\nIt was designed to be as lightweight as possible and take on all the wear and tear a tennis superstar like Nadal might put it through, Richard Mille said.\n\nNadal referred to it as his \"second skin\" timepiece. There were only 50 of these watches made at the time, according to Mille. You can buy one on the secondary market for $1.95 million.\n\nNadal collaborated with Richard Mille on several additional versions of this timepiece that the rapper later acquired. Jay-Z has also worn the Richard Mille Rafael Nadal 27-01, which has an anthracite casing.\n\nJay-Z shouted out Audemars Piguet in his 2011 \"Watch the Throne\" track \"N—s in Paris,\" saying: \"Ball so hard, got a broken clock / rollies that don't tick-tock / Audemars that's losing time / hidden behind all these big rocks.\"\n\nHe's also worn the brand. Included in his collection is the Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Perpetual Calendar Openworked 26585CE. It has an openwork sapphire dial, rose gold dial markers, a black ceramic band and case, and a titanium clasp.\n\nYou can buy one from the watchmaker, but it's \"price upon request\" — or, in other words, wildly expensive. To get it on the secondary market, you'll need to shell out over $375,000.\n\nWhen describing the Patek Philippe 6002 Sky Moon Tourbillon watch on its website, the brand notes the extensive detail that went into creating the timepiece.\n\nSome of the highlights include handmade engravings, a double-face design, a retrograde perpetual calendar, a sky chart, and more.\n\nIt's one of the most technically complicated Patek Philippe watches, and its price is only available \"on request.\" However, used versions of the watch can be found on the secondhand market for prices between $4 million and $6 million.\n\nJay-Z wore his model to Lebron James' 39th birthday party.\n\nThe Patek Philippe Nautilus 5711 in Tiffany Blue initially retailed for $52,635, but since only 170 were made, the price skyrocketed on the secondary market.\n\nDays after the watches sold out, one was auctioned off for $6.5 million, CNBC reported in 2021.\n\nJay-Z and Beyoncé were named Tiffany ambassadors that year.\n\nThe \"Yves Klein\" version of the Audemars Piguet Royal Oak 25594ST watch is an ode to the French artist. He's widely known for developing his own vibrant shade of blue — international Klein blue 191.\n\nThe Royal Oak design features a perpetual calendar, which keeps track of everything from the time and date to the moon's phases.\n\nIt's a popular style in its own right, but the Yves Klein version is especially rare. Few are rarely found on the resale market.\n\nJay-Z sported the Perpetual Calendar Split Seconds Chronograph 5004P watch during a decadent, seafood tower-filled lunch meeting with DJ Khaled in 2023.\n\nThe watch is modeled on Patek Philippe's first perpetual calendar watch, released in 1996.\n\nThe particular watch that Jay-Z has, the 5004P model with a silver link band, is nearly impossible to find, but it was valued at $600,000 in 2022, according to IFL Watches.\n\nThe Grandmaster Chime is considered Patek Philippe's most complicated watch, with more than 1,500 individual components.\n\nThe company made the watch in 2014 to commemorate its 175th anniversary, and only seven were produced. Six went to the watchmaker's most dedicated collectors (who apparently had to apply for the privilege of buying one), while the seventh went to the company's museum in Geneva.\n\nPatek Philippe then went on to make the Grandmaster Chime in other fabrications. Jay-Z has the white gold version, which runs around $2.5 million, according to reports.\n\nPatek Philippe produced this watch in limited quantities from 1950 to 1985. Only 349 were made.\n\nJay-Z's Patek Philippe 2499 was previously owned by Swedish watch collector and dealer Tony Kavak, who had a yellow-gold band specially made for the piece. As Kavak tells it, the watch wasn't initially for sale.\n\n\"The watch is so exclusive that I often chose not to wear it in public, and I always wear my watches, that's my philosophy,\" Kavak told watch site Bezl.\n\nBut he knew Jay-Z was the right person to own the watch, he added.\n\n\"You should have seen his happiness,\" Kavak said in an interview with watch blog Hodinkee. \"It just reminded me of how happy I get when I find something rare myself.\"\n\nNeither Kavak nor Jay-Z would reveal the deal's cost, but in 2022, a similar watch sold at auction for $7.68 million.\n\nHis first FP Journe Tourbillon Souverain was set with 93 baguette diamonds circling it and even more across its face, according to Celeb Watch Spotter. Jay-Z wore the piece for a meeting with Tom Brady.\n\nHis wife Beyoncé later shared photos from Super Bowl weekend on her website. They included a close-up shot of another FP Journe Tourbillon Souverain watch, this one in green, on Jay-Z's wrist.",

    "fullText": "Five-time Olympic medalist Eileen Gu just shut down a reporter's question asking if she'd \"lost\" two gold medals by finishing second in her events.\n\nThe 22-year-old Olympic freeskier, who was born in the US and is representing China in the 2026 Winter Olympics, was responding to a reporter who asked whether Gu felt disappointed not to win gold in Milan.\n\n\"Do you see these as two silvers gained or two golds lost?\" the journalist asked a press conference following her second silver at these games. During her Winter Olympic debut in Beijing in 2022, Gu won two golds.\n\nGu immediately laughed off his question and, without hesitation, said: \"I am the most decorated female freeskier in history.

Foo's post has received over 700,000 views.\n\nOther posts praising Gu for being confident and poised gained thousands of views.\n\nGu's messaging and self-advocacy follow the trend of what Business Insider's Amanda Yen recently dubbed \"The most Gen Z Olympics yet.\"\n\nIt's been an Olympics full of public statements and oversharing, Yen wrote.\n\nThis has included a Norwegian biathlete who confessed to cheating on his ex in a slopeside interview, and American figure skater Amber Glenn addressing discrimination against the queer community under President Donald Trump.",

    "description": "Some Starbucks investors are urging against re-electing two board members who they say are responsible for \"backsliding\" labor relations.",
    "fullText": "A group of Starbucks investors is escalating their pressure campaign over the coffee giant's ongoing labor turmoil — and this time, they're targeting the board.\n\nAhead of the company's March 25 annual meeting, a coalition of long-term shareholders that have advocated for workers' rights is urging investors to vote against the reelection of Jørgen Vig Knudstorp, the lead independent director, and Beth Ford, the chair of the nominating and corporate governance committee. The group cites what they call \"sustained oversight failures of labor relations.\"\n\n\"We have a world‑class board of directors with deep, relevant expertise, who is supporting our management team in driving a business turnaround,\" a Starbucks spokesperson told Business Insider.\n\nUS baristas began unionizing in late 2021. More than four years — and four strikes, supported by politicians like Bernie Sanders and Zohran Mamdani — later, the company has not reached its first collective bargaining agreement.\n\nStarbucks Workers United says it represents more than 12,000 baristas at over 600 locations. After Starbucks shuttered hundreds of US stores in September, a Starbucks spokesperson said the union represents closer to 550, or less than 5%, of its company-owned stores.\n\nA Starbucks spokesperson told Business Insider in October that the company offers \"best-in-class benefits\" and said the union's demands for a 77% increase in the minimum wage for hourly partners over the life of a three-year contract are \"not sustainable.\"\n\nThe company also said in a public statement that union delegates \"prematurely ended\" its last bargaining session in late December 2024.\n\nThe investors organizing against the board members include New York City Comptroller Mark Levine, Trillium ESG Global Equity Mutual Fund, Merseyside Pension Fund, and the Shareholder Association for Research and Education. These activist shareholders argue that Starbucks' board has retreated from its prior commitments to strengthen labor relations as tensions have flared again.\n\n\"The sudden U-turn on labor relations oversight by Starbucks' Board is inconsistent with the Company's turnaround strategy and commitments — and changes have not been explained to shareholders,\" the shareholder letter reads.\n\nThe letter points to mounting legal and reputational risks facing the company. In the first three years of organizing, workers filed over 700 charges of labor rights violations with the National Labor Relations Board against Starbucks and its outside counsel. The Economic Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, found the number of charges filed was \"almost certainly\" the highest number in history.\n\nSince January 2025, workers have filed more than 125 unfair labor practice charges, including allegations of failure to bargain in good faith and retaliatory firings. They also launched three work stoppages, the latest of which began in November and is ongoing at 17 locations. Starbucks has 16,911 locations in the US.\n\nStarbucks has also faced a $38.9 million settlement with New York City in December over alleged Fair Workweek Law violations affecting more than 15,000 workers — \"the largest labor law settlement in the city's history,\" the letter says.\n\nJonas Kron, the chief advocacy officer at $4.2 billion Trillium Asset Management, one of the investor groups that signed the letter, told Business Insider that Starbucks' labor reputation is \"enormously important\" for shareholder value.\n\n\"And reputation can slip in the world of social media relatively quickly and with some pretty small episodes,\" Kron said. \"It's not that many stores, that may be true, but that doesn't diminish the impact that it can have.\"\n\nStarbucks has acknowledged the risks posed by its ongoing labor battle. In its most recent annual report, the company said work stoppages from unionized baristas can \"have a negative impact on our reputation and brand.\"\n\nThe investor group argues that the board initially appeared to take those risks seriously. In late 2023, following a shareholder proposal supported by a majority and the threat of a proxy contest, Starbucks created an Environmental, Partner, and Community Impact (EPCI) Committee, tasked primarily with overseeing labor relations.\n\nThat committee was \"quietly eliminated\" in November, with the board taking over three months to \"provide an unpersuasive justification\" of its breakup, the investors wrote.\n\nA Starbucks spokesperson said the move gave the full board responsibility for labor oversight to ensure accountability, consistency, and alignment with company priorities.\n\nThe investor group has concerns.\n\n\"This inconsistency and abrupt reversal raise legitimate concerns about whether the Board is retreating from the focused, independent oversight it previously deemed necessary,\" the letter states.\n\nThe governance shift comes as Starbucks continues its turnaround under CEO Brian Niccol, whose strategy centers on improving service and strengthening connections between staff and customers.\n\n\"Starbucks' turnaround plan depends on an engaged workforce and improved in-store experience, both of which are strained by ongoing labor conflict,\" the investors wrote.\n\nMichelle Eisen, a spokesperson for the Starbucks Workers United union and a 15-year veteran barista, told Business Insider in a statement that Starbucks \"doesn't work\" without its baristas.\n\n\"We also know that Starbucks could be the 'Best Job in Retail,' as company executives say, but it isn't right now and hasn't been for a very long time,\" Eisen said. \"Bringing about long-term stability at Starbucks begins with a fair union contract.\"\n\nThe investor coalition argues that Knudstorp and Ford are \"uniquely accountable\" for the labor tensions, given their roles. Knudstorp chaired the nominating and corporate governance committee from 2019 through 2025, served on the EPCI committee, and became lead independent director in 2025. Ford joined the board in 2023, chaired the EPCI committee, and now leads the nominating and corporate governance committee.\n\nThe investors also point to what they describe as waning transparency and engagement. In proxy statements, Starbucks reported at least 30 shareholder engagements in both 2023 and 2024, and 18 in 2025.\n\n\"Taken together, these changes suggest a troubling retreat from transparency, responsiveness, and commitment to engage on labor oversight matters material to shareholder value,\" the investors wrote.",

    "description": "The USS Joseph P. Kennedy Jr., a Gearing-class destroyer, carried out numerous missions for the US Navy and NASA during its years of service.",
    "fullText": "In the 2000 film \"Thirteen Days\" dramatizing the Cuban Missile Crisis, the USS Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. reprised the role of a lifetime.\n\nBack in 1962, the Gearing-class destroyer stopped a freighter heading toward Cuba that was suspected of carrying missile parts, sending a boarding party to inspect its cargo in a display of the US Navy's might.\n\nDuring the filming of \"Thirteen Days,\" the USS Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. reenacted this pivotal mission, playing herself in a triumphant return to the open seas nearly 40 years later.\n\nHaving served in the Korean War, Vietnam War, and the Cold War, the ship's ability to star in a movie is a testament to the work of museum staff and volunteers at Battleship Cove in Fall River, Massachusetts, to keep it afloat.\n\n\"There's always this constant desire to bring the ships back to their original configuration, and our volunteers are heavily involved in that,\" Christopher Nardi, Battleship Cove's chief operating officer, told Business Insider. \"We have a really good core of volunteers.\"\n\nI visited the ship — now a museum and war memorial — named for President John F. Kennedy's older brother. Take a look inside the USS Joseph P. Kennedy Jr., whose sailors affectionately called her \"Joey P.\"\n\nCommissioned in 1945, the ship was built in just eight months as part of the Gearing-class of destroyers.\n\nAt 390 feet long, it just outstretches the length of one football field.\n\nThe crew consisted of 288 men: 18 officers and 270 enlisted. When fully loaded, it weighed 3,460 tons.\n\nThe eldest son of Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. and the older brother of the future President John F. Kennedy, \"Joe\" was a lieutenant in the US Navy. He and his co-pilot, Lieutenant Wilford John Willy, died during Operation Aphrodite in 1944 when the explosives aboard their plane detonated before they ejected to safety.\n\nIn attendance were Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., his wife, Rose Kennedy, and their children Patricia, Jean, Ted, and Eunice.\n\nHomeported in Newport, Rhode Island, the destroyer also traveled to Washington, DC, for Kennedy's inauguration in 1961.\n\nThe USS Joseph P. Kennedy helped recover spacecraft from the ocean during NASA's Project Mercury in 1961 and the Gemini 6 and 7 missions in 1965.\n\nThe destroyer also participated in the US naval blockade of Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, boarding the freighter Marcula to search it for missile components.\n\nThe USS Joseph P. Kennedy was decommissioned in 1973.\n\nLocated in Fall River, Massachusetts, Battleship Cove is also home to the battleship USS Massachusetts and the submarine USS Lionfish.\n\nI visited the museum in January and paid $25 for a general-admission adult ticket.\n\nThe 5-inch guns could fire projectiles weighing 55 pounds up to 10 miles.\n\nDASHes, smaller than regular helicopters, were deployed to drop torpedoes on unsuspecting enemy submarines.\n\nThe hangar and flight deck were added to the ship as part of the Navy's Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) program in 1961.\n\nThis device was known as a \"pepperbox\" or \"matchbox\" launcher for its boxy shape. It could fire torpedoes over 5 miles away.\n\nSome parts of the deck were blocked off for preservation work as museum volunteers restored the ship.\n\nThe bridge featured navigation, steering, and communication equipment. It was situated high up with numerous windows for maximum visibility.\n\nThe wardroom featured a portrait of the ship's namesake, Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.\n\nOfficers ate the same meals as the rest of the crew, but in a more elevated atmosphere.\n\nMenus included seasonal meals, such as turkey for Thanksgiving dinner, to boost crew morale.\n\nI was surprised by how narrow the hallways were, reminiscent of a submarine.\n\nCrew members who worked in this office were known as Yeomen and Personnelmen.\n\nCrew members in the supply department oversaw supplies of tactical items, such as ammunition, and other necessities, such as food.\n\nThe sick bay was also equipped for minor surgeries, complete with a folding operating table.\n\nThe oil king was the ship's fuel expert responsible for keeping the fuel tanks full and monitoring the quality of the boiler feedwater.\n\nWhen crew members were at their battle stations, the engineering department transformed into damage control central to coordinate repairs to the ship.\n\nIf the sick bay was unavailable or compromised, the barbershop could also function as a space to treat injuries sustained in combat.\n\nETs worked with everything from crucial radio and weapons systems to power tools from the ship's machine shop.\n\nThe ship store on board the USS Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. displayed shaving cream and razors, as well as recognizable brands of snacks such as Sun-Maid raisins, Planters mixed nuts, and Ritz crackers.\n\nWith a crew of 288 men packed into a 390-foot-long ship, personal space was hard to come by.\n\nThe machine shop also occasionally assisted with servicing other ships.\n\nFresh water had many uses on the ship. The first priority was filling the boilers that kept the ship's steam-powered system running. Drinking, bathing, and cooking were secondary priorities.\n\nThe degaussing switchboard sent direct-current voltage to coils throughout the ship to reduce its magnetic signature, preventing it from setting off magnetic naval mines.\n\nAn unoccupied chair of honor, dedicated to prisoners of war and those missing in action, symbolizes that \"there will always be a place awaiting their return,\" the accompanying plaque reads.\n\nThe USS Joseph P. Kennedy Jr., like many retired warships, was at risk of being disassembled for spare parts until it was acquired by a museum dedicated to its preservation and restoration.\n\n\"Especially in the case of the Kennedy, she sat in Newport for a few years, and so other active ships' crews would come on board and take what they needed for their ships if it was the appropriate equipment,\" Nardi said. \"So we're very lucky compared to some other ships and stuff they lost.\"\n\nModern guided-missile destroyers, such as Arleigh Burke- and Zumwalt-class destroyers, are equipped to both launch and intercept missiles. They have recently been deployed to the Middle East in June 2025 to counter Iranian ballistic missile attacks aimed at Israel and to the Caribbean in September 2025 to combat drug cartels.",

    "title": "Why Berkshire Hathaway's New York Times bet is a fitting end to the Warren Buffett era",
    "description": "Warren Buffett went from delivering newspapers to owning dozens of them. Berkshire Hathaway bought a New York Times stake in his final quarter as CEO.",
    "fullText": "Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway bought one new stock in his last quarter as CEO: The New York Times Company. It's a fitting final bet for the Buffett era.\n\nThe famed investor's conglomerate scooped up around 5.1 million shares of the newspaper publisher, securing a stake worth $352 million at December's close, a Tuesday filing revealed.\n\nThe position's small size points to one of Buffett's two investment managers at the time — Ted Weschler and the since-departed Todd Combs — making the purchase.\n\nBuffett is a lifelong lover of newspapers. He delivered 500,000 papers as a teenager running multiple routes, and for years, he challenged shareholders to best him at newspaper tossing during Berkshire's annual meetings.\n\nHe went from throwing newspapers to owning dozens of publishers, including The Buffalo News and The Omaha World-Herald. He was close friends with the late publisher of The Washington Post, Katharine Graham, and one of the paper's biggest financial backers.\n\nDuring Berkshire's 2010 meeting, he recalled looking at the circulation of major titles such as the San Francisco Chronicle, and said it \"blows your mind how fast people are dropping it.\"\n\n\"The world has really changed, in terms of the essential nature of newspapers,\" he said.\n\nIn 1965 or 1970, there was \"probably nothing looked more bulletproof than a daily newspaper where the competition had melted away,\" he continued. \"But it's a form of distributing information and entertainment that has lost its immediacy in many cases.\"\n\nBuffett pointed out that people no longer rely on papers to find out how their stocks were performing, or whether their sports team won. The resulting decline in circulation made newspapers less attractive to advertisers, he noted.\n\n\"And so you get this chicken and egg thing that the newspaper becomes less valuable as the advertisers float away, and the advertisers float away as the subscribers diminish,\" he said.\n\nDespite his concerns, he acquired 28 daily papers in the early 2010s.\n\n\"Charlie and I believe that papers delivering comprehensive and reliable information to tightly-bound communities and having a sensible Internet strategy will remain viable for a long time,\" Buffett wrote in his 2012 letter to shareholders. \"Charlie\" referred to his late business partner, Charlie Munger.\n\n\"Newspapers continue to reign supreme ... in the delivery of local news,\" he added.\n\nBuffett struck a far more bearish tone in 2019, telling Yahoo Finance that he expected only a few national titles, such as The New York Times, to survive, while the rest would \"disappear.\" He also bemoaned the demise of the newspaper ad business.\n\n\"It went from monopoly to franchise to competitive to ... toast,\" he said.\n\nBuffett offloaded Berkshire's newspapers to publisher Lee Enterprises in 2020. Given his long history in the newspaper business and eventual exit from it, it's striking to see Berkshire return with its recent stock purchase.\n\nOne reason was undoubtedly The New York Times' recovery in recent years. It grew revenues by 9% to $2.8 billion and its net income by 17% to $344 million last year, as subscription revenues rose 9% and advertising revenues jumped 12%.\n\nA key driver was the paper's addition of 1.4 million digital-only subscribers, which lifted its total subscriber count to 12.78 million as of December 31.\n\nThe publisher's stock price has already seen some of the benefits. After collapsing from over $50 in mid-2002 to below $5 in early 2009, it has surged roughly 15-fold — including 50% in the past year — to trade at a record high of $74 at Tuesday's close.\n\nThe shares gained another 3% in Wednesday's premarket, perhaps marking one of the final cases of the \"Buffett Effect,\" where other investors mimic his buys and sells, moving markets.\n\nThe publisher's comeback might explain why Buffett and his team decided to revisit one of his favorite industries so soon after turning the page.",

    "description": "The firm's Michael Kantrowitz said investors should look at stocks with high sensitivity to manufacturing, as data shows the sector is poised to expand.",
    "fullText": "All signs point to a cyclical boom ahead, according to Piper Sander's top strategist, Michael Kantrowitz — and the firm says it \"strongly\" advises investors to load up on stocks best positioned to benefit from the shift.\n\n\"We continue to recommend investors overweight their portfolios with stocks sensitive to the ISM (across all sectors) as we expect there is a lot more alpha left in the next year or so as PMIs rebound, and the business cycle broadens out,\" Kantrowitz wrote in a client note Tuesday. ISM and PMI refer to the Institute for Supply Management's Purchasing Manager Indexes, which provide various gauges for measuring manufacturing activity.\n\nSeventy percent of PMIs are now expanding, the note showed, having recently crossed the 50% threshold. In every instance when that has happened, going back to the 1970s, it has hit 100%, suggesting manufacturing activity has further room to pick up.\n\nThis is important because manufacturing data leads earnings breadth, Kantrowitz said. If factories are humming, so is earnings growth, and by extension, stocks.\n\nOn top of all of this, further rate cuts likely lie ahead with the job growth still relatively tepid, the note said. Rate cuts help stimulate economic activity by making it cheaper for firms to borrow.\n\nWith a compelling bull case for cyclical stocks ahead, Kantrowitz shared a list of stocks most sensitive to ISM Manufacturing data.\n\nBelow are the 14 on the list that are both among the highest correlated to ISM data and which are in the top decile of Piper Sandler's \"Macro Select\" framework, which it uses to rate the attractiveness of a stock at a given moment.

    "title": "Ukraine's drone war showed the West it needs to view small drones less like prized gear and more like expendable ammo",
    "description": "Western militaries often view new technology as precious and valuable. Ukraine shows that they can't afford to view small drones that way.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's large-scale drone war is pushing Western militaries to treat small drones less as high-end equipment and more as expendable ammunition that isn't meant to come back.\n\nUS Army and British Army officials, as well as a NATO veteran who volunteered to fight in Ukraine, told Business Insider that effective drone warfare requires sending large numbers forward — and accepting many will be lost as a routine cost.\n\nMaj. Rachel Martin, the director of the US Army's new drone lethality course, told Business Insider that the conflict shows that \"if you're going to flood the zone with drones,\" especially in a combat situation where electronic warfare is heavy, \"you're going to lose a lot of drones.\"\n\nShe said it's a \"transition from the army of old,\" where a lost drone was \"a significant emotional event\" that was reported to senior leadership. In Ukraine, it's different. \"Drones go down all the time.\" There, losses are typically shrugged off, rather than investigated.\n\nThat shifting mindset is shaping how Western militaries train.\n\nLt. Col. Ben Irwin-Clark, the commanding officer of the British Army's 1st Battalion of the Irish Guards, told Business Insider that his battalion has changed its training to allow drones to be damaged or even destroyed to reflect battlefield realities. \"I absolutely think they need to be disposable because otherwise you're not training realistically,\" he said.\n\nJakub Jajcay, a former special forces member from Slovakia who fought in Ukraine, told Business Insider that if NATO militaries want to start using drones for real missions, they \"need to get used to the fact that they're basically expendable material more akin to ammunition or fuel or gasoline, things like that, rather than specialized high-end pieces of equipment that need to be looked after.\"\n\nHe said when he was serving in the military for his home country, \"drones were very specialized pieces of equipment.\"\n\nThe drones were fairly expensive, he shared, \"and there was always a sort of bureaucratic process\" in using them. Sometimes, only designated individuals were allowed to use the drones.\n\nIf something happened to a drone, \"that would've been a big problem in training. If we had lost a drone, somebody would've been in big trouble for that.\" The war in Ukraine shows how poorly that peacetime mindset fits large-scale combat.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has featured drones on an unprecedented scale. Ukraine says roughly 80% of its strikes are carried out using drones rather than other weapons. Many never reach their targets and are lost along the way, though.\n\nCheap drones worth several hundred dollars have destroyed weaponry worth millions. But many of them don't have any effect. A report last year from the UK's Royal United Services Institute said that \"between 60 and 80% of Ukrainian FPVs fail to reach their target, depending on the part of the front and the skill of the operators.\"\n\nSome drones are jammed or disrupted by electronic warfare, while others are shot down or get their cables cut. Sometimes they're knocked out by soldiers on their own side.\n\nMany of the drones on the battlefield are single-use, designed to explode when they hit their target, but many of them are destroyed, damaged, or disabled before they even reach that point.\n\nJajcay said that even drones designed to be used again and again \"have a lifespan of maybe a few dozen missions at most.\"\n\nHe also said that drones failed \"all the time,\" and those losses were expected.\n\nThe US Army is recognizing and learning from these dynamics in Ukraine, as are other Western militaries, as they incorporate the idea that drones cannot be treated as overly precious assets into their drone warfare training and doctrine.\n\nMaj. Wolf Amacker, who leads the Army's Unmanned Aircraft Systems and Tactics Branch at the Aviation Center of Excellence, told Business Insider that out of the thousands of drones used daily, only around 30% of them hit their targets, while many others don't have a significant impact on their targets.\n\nThe Army is learning that lots of drones need to be sent forward.\n\nIrwin-Clark told Business Insider that the way the UK sees drones has also shifted. He said \"every time there's an iterative change in technology in the battlefield, everyone gets very excited about it and the ownership of that asset tends to be far too high.\"\n\nHe said that often when a new and powerful technology emerges, senior leaders will try to tightly control it, arguing that because there are only a handful available, only a select few should have the authority to decide when it's used. The assets are carefully protected, at least initially. Later on, trust is imparted to soldiers to handle technology previously in the charge of higher-ups.\n\nThat pattern, Irwin-Clark said, is \"exactly what's happening with drones.\"\n\nHis battalion wrapped the first drones it received years ago in bubble wrap, \"and we didn't fly them very often,\" he said. \"When we did,\" he continued, \"we made sure we flew in the middle of a field with nothing, no obstacles around.\"\n\nNow, his battalion is deliberately crashing its latest drone delivery into targets, while looking at how to make repairs. \"It really doesn't matter if we break them,\" Irwin-Clark said.\n\nThe US is coming at it the same way. Martin, who previously commanded a Gray Eagle drone company, said her course takes into account that \"drones crash. I'll say that to the day I die having owned drones as a commander: drones crash.\"\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said last year that the defense department needs to view small drones as consumables rather than \"durable property\" — more like ammunition than valuable equipment. It's a change that Jajcay described as \"a step in the right direction.\"\n\nWestern armies were using various drones in warfare before Russia's invasion, often using them as surveillance platforms or tools for launching missile strikes. Small drones weren't used the way they're being used in Ukraine, but the US, UK, and others are learning drone lessons from the war.\n\nMartin said the ongoing conflict in Ukraine shows that even when you lose drones, it's ultimately \"still cheaper than employing missiles on specific targets.\" That's an equation the US Army can't totally ignore.\n\n\"They're cheaper, and you're not putting human lives in danger\" to carry out the mission, she shared. And the Army knows that \"they're going to crash. It's going to happen.\"",

    "fullText": "One of Wall Street's biggest crypto skeptics is taking fresh aim at bitcoin amid its steep sell-off.\n\nNouriel Roubini — also known as \"Dr. Doom\" for his frequently apocalyptic predictions on markets and the economy — doubled down on his view that bitcoin is far from being an inflation hedge and is a \"pseudo-asset class.\"\n\nBitcoin, which entered bear market territory late last year, traded around $67,400 on Wednesday, down 45% from its peak in late October.\n\n\"Calling Bitcoin or any other crypto vehicle a 'currency' has always been bogus. It is neither a unit of account, a scalable means of payment, nor a stable store of value,\" Roubini wrote in an op-ed for Project Syndicate earlier this month.\n\nRoubini, who has blasted bitcoin in the past as a \"Ponzi Game\" associated with criminal activity and said he believed the token was in \"the mother of all bubbles,\" pointed to the crypto's potential use in illegal transactions. He also said that crypto broadly poses a risk to the financial system as lawmakers integrate it further into traditional banking.\n\nIn particular, he highlighted the GENIUS Act, and said the landmark stablecoin bill should be remembered as the \"Reckless Idiot Act,\" partly because the bill specifies that stablecoins do not have lender-of-last resort or deposit insurance benefits.\n\nThe push among some players in the crypto industry to allow interest payments on stablecoins could further \"undermine the foundations of the banking system,\" he added.\n\n\"Thus, all it would take to incite a panic and trigger a bank run is for a few bad apples in pseudo-libertarian US states to mis-invest their holdings or place their deposits in weak institutions,\" Roubini speculated. \"This is a political and financial stability issue, and few are as serious or as sensitive,\" he later added.\n\nBitcoin's pronounced sell-off has slashed the token's value nearly in half. Should its decline lead to a true bitcoin winter, some forecasters see the coin dropping to as low as $31,000, a more than 50% drop from the token's current levels.",

    "title": "A startup wants to beat Airbus and Boeing with an ultra-wide 'flying wing' jet with massive cargo space",
    "description": "The CEO said Horizon's redesign with two decks across an ultra-wide cabin captures lucrative cargo space that is unavailable on exisiting narrobodies.",
    "fullText": "Airbus' CEO recently said the future of flying is a B2-bomber-shaped \"blended-wing body\" plane with passengers housed inside the plane's one giant wing for maximum efficiency.\n\nAleksey Matyushev, the CEO of the US aerospace startup Natilus, told Business Insider that his company has taken that vision one step further by redesigning its proposed blended-wing plane, Horizon, with plans to offer more lucrative cargo space while still delivering the 50% lower operating costs and up to 250 seats previously promised.\n\nInstead of the single-deck seating layout originally planned, the newly unveiled Horizon Evo — which the company expects to enter service as soon as the early 2030s — reimagines what cargo-heavy passenger jets can look like by adding a \"dual-deck\" layout.\n\nSo far, Natilus' blended-wing vision is just a sketch on paper, and a mini-sized prototype it's been flying; actually developing and certifying the new plane type and getting it into the air is a much longer road.\n\nStill, the dual-deck idea should be familiar to regulators and airlines, as it is the configuration of traditional tube-and-wing jets where passengers sit in a single level above the cargo hold. When installed on an ultra-wide blended-body, it results in a very cargo-heavy plane.\n\nEvo is expected to boast 2,600 cubic feet of dedicated cargo space on the lower level. For context, most Boeing 737s or Airbus A320s, which are at least 10 feet longer but have a cabin roughly half as wide despite similar wingspans, offer between roughly 1,300 and 1,800 cubic feet of belly cargo space.\n\nThis cargo focus comes at a time when belly freight has become one of the most reliable money-makers in aviation (e-commerce helped keep airlines afloat during the pandemic). The lure could help break the Airbus-Boeing duopoly while also addressing a projected shortfall of roughly 15,000 narrow-body aircraft over the next two decades.\n\n\"The market has gravitated toward a single-deck [blended-wing] layout because it's simpler to design and build in many ways, but I just don't see it as operationally better,\" Matyushev said.\n\nCalifornia-based competitor JetZero, for example, is developing a single-deck version. Company leaders have previously said there is a lower deck for the landing gear and some cargo containers, but it could move that floor up to create more space.\n\nMaking a dual-deck layout in a blended-wing aircraft is challenging. Unlike conventional jets, the design spreads volume horizontally rather than vertically, and stacking passengers above a cargo deck in this uniquely triangular-shaped airframe requires careful structural and engineering solutions.\n\nEvo's cargo economics could shake up the market for freight-reliant carriers. With roughly 11,000 cubic feet of cargo space across its two levels, Matyushev said Evo could serve as a dedicated freighter — potentially replacing planes like the Boeing 757.\n\n\"There's a huge product gap left behind by the 757; companies like UPS and FedEx heavily rely on that configuration,\" Matyushev said. \"Evo has the same volumetric capacity as a 757 but in a smaller airframe.\"\n\nBeyond cargo, Matyushev said the plane's unique geometry would similarly enhance the customer experience: airlines could fit the wide upper level with unique living spaces, such as a playroom or mini-offices.\n\nHe added that the economy cabin would feature more overhead bins and three aisles for better comfort, door access, and safety during evacuations: \"It'd have four sets of three seats across, which is close to the A380,\" Matyushev said, referring to the superjumbo's possible 11-abreast seats.\" We're thinking about it like a widebody layout in a narrow-body type of footprint.\"\n\nMatyushev also said that Evo would have windows — something Airbus' top executive warned could be absent from some blended-wing designs. A windowless passenger jet could create a claustrophobic environment, and flight attendants may struggle to see outside as easily during an emergency.\n\nNatilus doesn't have a prototype of Evo, but a subscale model of its blended-wing cargo plane, called Kona, has been test-flying since 2023. Kona has secured orders from companies like US-based Ameriflight and Canada-based Norlinor, while Indian carrier SpiceJet has signed a conditional deal for 100 Evos.\n\nNatilus has raised $28 million in Series A financing to support its first full-scale Kona prototype and further development of Evo. It typically costs billions of dollars to develop passenger-ready commercial jetliners, and Natilus has a long way to go.\n\nThe 737 Max cost around $2 billion to develop (before safety issues and the subsequent global grounding forced Boeing to redesign the plane). It was built on an older airframe that cost around $1.1 billion, in inflation-adjusted dollars, to develop. Meanwhile, the Airbus A320neo cost just over $1 billion to develop; it was also built on an older airframe, that originally cost around $3 billion to develop.\n\nNatilus isn't the only company betting on a Jetsons-like blended-wing aircraft. United Airlines has tentatively committed to buying up to 200 of JetZero's \"Z4,\" which it previously described to Business Insider as a \"living room in the sky.\"\n\nAirbus has also been developing a commercial flying wing since 2017 as part of its ZEROe program, which aims to build zero-emission airlines powered by hydrogen rather than traditional jet fuel. That project flew a demonstrator in 2019 but has since been delayed at least a decade from its initial 2035 timeline.",

    "fullText": "I'm thrilled to share that Business Insider has won the George Polk Award for Environmental Reporting for The True Cost of Data Centers, an investigation that created the most comprehensive national database of data centers and revealed hidden costs of the AI boom.\n\nThe George Polk Awards, which honor original, resourceful, and thought-provoking investigative work, are widely considered among the most prestigious in journalism. The judges said Business Insider's investigation was \"a thoroughly researched series highlighting the strain new and semi-secret facilities that fuel artificial intelligence are likely to place on communities, diverting overwhelming amounts of power, water and economic support.\"\n\nThis is Business Insider's first Polk Award. It is a milestone for our newsroom as we focus our investigative chops on the most crucial subjects in business, and as we combine our extraordinary talents across text, data, visuals, video, and more to deliver world-class journalism.\n\nThe True Cost of Data Centers identified 1,240 data centers built or approved across the US by the end of 2024 — nearly four times the number from 2010 — and exposed an infrastructure transformation happening almost entirely in secret. By filing public records requests across every US state and winning lawsuits to obtain water consumption data, our team uncovered how these data centers together would consume as much power as entire US states and guzzle enormous amounts of water daily in drought-stricken regions.\n\nBusiness Insider's investigation included a first-of-its-kind interactive national map displaying all 1,240 data centers for readers to see how close the data center boom is to their own backyards. It also included a documentary video, \"Exposing The Dark Side of America's AI Data Center Explosion,\" which has been watched more than 5 million times.\n\nThe database has been shared with 23 universities, including Harvard, MIT, Princeton, Stanford, Yale, and Columbia, and has been cited in at least 15 policy briefs.\n\nI am incredibly proud of this team for the creativity, care, and persistence it took to make this investigation happen. The reporting team includes Hannah Beckler, Dakin Campbell, Daniel Geiger, Rosemarie Ho, Narimes Parakul, Adam Rogers, and Ellen Thomas, along with editors Jeffrey Cane, Rosalie Chan, Jason Dean, Esther Kaplan, and Jake Swearingen.\n\nOn video, credit to Erica Berenstein, Alexander Calbi, Paige Clark, Robert Leslie, Reem Makhoul, Tyler Merkel, Ruqayyah Moynihan, Marco Secci, and Whitney Shefte.

    "fullText": "Tesla has avoided a 30-day suspension of its dealer and manufacturer licenses in California. The cost: \"Autopilot.\"\n\nThe reprieve comes two months after the state ordered the automaker to stop using the term in its vehicle marketing.\n\nOn Tuesday, the California Department of Motor Vehicles said Tesla had taken the required corrective action following a December administrative ruling over the marketing of its driver-assistance features.\n\nIn November 2023, the DMV accused Tesla of misleading consumers by advertising its systems — branded as \"Autopilot\" and \"Full Self-Driving\" — in ways that implied the vehicles were capable of autonomous driving.\n\nThe decision effectively ends a three-year legal fight between Tesla and California regulators. The state is critical for the EV maker — it's the car company's largest US sales market and home to two manufacturing hubs.\n\nAutopilot was the name of Tesla's Level-2 driver-assistance feature, including lane tracing and cruise control adjustment. The company's then-called Full-Self Driving included Level-3 driver assistance, in which the car would turn its wheels and apply the brakes, but required human eyes on the road and readiness to take control at a moment's notice.\n\nAn administrative law judge in November 2025 concluded that Tesla's use of the term \"Autopilot\" violated California law and recommended suspending the company's licenses for 30 days if the automaker continued using the branding in its marketing materials.\n\nThe DMV adopted the judge's findings in December but permanently stayed the suspension and gave Tesla 60 days to comply.\n\nTesla had already modified its \"Full Self-Driving\" branding to \"Full Self-Driving (Supervised)\" in September 2024.\n\nThe company also clarified that the system worked \"with minimal driver intervention.\"\n\n🤔 @Tesla is no longer selling \"FSD\" as a package.

    "description": "With little planning, our family permanently moved to Canada in 3 weeks. There's a lot I wish we'd known about immigration and other challenges.",
    "fullText": "\"I guess we're moving to Canada.\"\n\nIt was a quiet, almost outrageous statement considering our position. Just a few weeks earlier, Hurricane Dorian had slammed into our home in the Bahamas, a country I'd lived in my entire life.\n\nMy family had spent 24 hours trapped in our attic, praying the roof would hold before evacuating to nearby Florida.\n\nOnce we arrived, we found ourselves stuck in immigration limbo.\n\nFor as long as possible, we tried to remain in Florida, close to home. However, in the wake of the disaster, the US authorities limited many Bahamians to stays of only a few weeks, our family among them.\n\nWe had no legal option to stay in the US long-term, but we didn't want to return to devastation, either. This left us with very little time to figure out a future for our 6-year-old daughter and four dogs.\n\nCanada started to seem like our best option, since the country was actively looking for immigrants, with pathways toward legal permanent residency.\n\nWe weren't confident in our choice, but we committed. I wish I'd known what was in store for us over the next three weeks.\n\nOnce we'd set our sights on Canada, we narrowed our search to areas that met our nonnegotiables: Our home had to be near the ocean and within driving distance of some of our relatives in the US.\n\nWe looked into school districts and housing costs and settled on a small town we'd only ever seen on Google Maps and Google Earth.\n\nFrom our temporary place in Florida, I cried and squinted over blurry Street Views, looking for a sign from the universe.\n\nDuring the most frantic time of my life, I learned to pay attention to the things that soothed my soul and made me breathe easier.\n\nThe endless forests lining the residential streets, the deer-crossing signs, and the knowledge that the ocean would be just a short drive away were our consolations.\n\nMy wife found a home on a local real-estate site that was the size and location we were hunting for. When we spotted a seashell from the tropics sitting on the bathroom counter in the grainy photos, it felt like a sign from the universe that we were on the right path.\n\nWhen we showed up, the place turned out to be the perfect fit.\n\nOf course, our journey wasn't as simple as just selecting a property to call home. Moving to a brand-new country can be a legal maze full of dead ends.\n\nWe knew we needed help with our immigration applications almost right away, but we didn't know anyone in the field to ask questions.\n\nWe reached out to every Canadian we knew, asking for a referral to an immigration attorney. It didn't take long to find one: the ex-wife of our daughter's camp counselor's sister. The world might be a big place, but six degrees of separation is still a solid link.\n\nThe paperwork was overwhelming. Every time I thought we finally had everything, our lawyer emailed another list of documents we needed. I ended up calling in favors back home and begging officials for copies of things as I struggled with the delays and extra stress.\n\nI learned the hard way that I should have all our important documents in the cloud before ever needing them.\n\nMoving to a new country with only three weeks of preparation is unhinged.\n\nFor a long time, we struggled with mental-health issues from the trauma of the hurricane and the quick, major changes that followed.\n\nI didn't handle the stress well at all. I threw a fork at the dinner table once and had a full-on anxiety attack when I couldn't find the car keys.\n\nTo-do lists became my lifeline, and eventually, I accepted that I couldn't make the process perfect. It took years of therapy to feel stable again and for our new home to really feel like home.\n\nEventually, we managed to focus on the good in Canada, even though it was so different from where we'd lived before. We learned our new country had \n\nToday, we even tease our daughter that she is more Canadian than Bahamian when she insists she doesn't need a coat in sub-zero temperatures.\n\nAt times, we catch ourselves acting very much like the locals — complaining about the weather constantly and apologizing for everything.\n\nSix years later, I'm confident this move was the best decision we could have made for ourselves and our family. However, I still tell people, \"Don't move to a new country with only three weeks of planning!\"\n\nSometimes, though, there's little choice in the matter. And whether it's been planned for three weeks or three years, a move won't ever be perfect.\n\nMoving to a new country quickly is ridiculous, complex, and emotional, but survivable — and you can find peace on the other side of the chaos.",

    "description": "The checks are from a 2024 settlement with private lender Navient over claims that it \"cheated\" student-loan borrowers out of lower monthly payments.",
    "fullText": "Student-loan borrowers, check the mail: there might be some money waiting for you.\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau — a federal watchdog — announced that on February 13, checks began going out in the mail to student-loan borrowers who qualified for a portion of the settlement the agency reached with major lender Navient in 2024.\n\nThe settlement resolved claims from a 2017 lawsuit that accused the servicer of misleading borrowers about their repayment plan options, leaving them \"cheated\" out of lower monthly payments. The settlement permanently banned Navient from servicing federal student loans and required it to return $100 million to borrowers.\n\nThe payments are ongoing, and the CFPB has contracted with Rust Consulting — a firm that manages settlements — to administer them. The CFPB said in its latest announcement that the payments do not reduce any student loans that borrowers currently have.\n\n\"I think there's been millions of Americans who could have avoided the consequences of default if they had been treated properly by their servicer,\" Former CFPB Director Rohit Chopra told Business Insider in 2024 after the settlement was announced.\n\nIn addition to misleading borrowers about their payment plans, the CFPB accused Navient in its lawsuit of making errors in processing borrowers' payments, failing to deliver relief to defaulted borrowers, and misrepresenting cosigner requirements for taking out loans.\n\nNavient did not deny any wrongdoing and said in a statement at the time that \"while we do not agree with the CFPB's allegations, this resolution is consistent with our go-forward activities and is an important positive milestone in our transformation of the company.\"\n\nThe settlement was reached under former President Joe Biden, and it's unlikely that the Trump administration will pursue similar oversight. President Donald Trump slashed CFPB staff as part of his broader effort to reduce the federal workforce, and an April 2025 internal memo from the CFPB's chief legal officer called on the CFPB to \"deprioritize\" oversight over student loans.\n\nWith Trump's looming changes to student-loan repayment, oversight over the industry could be even more critical, some lawmakers and policy experts have said. The Department of Education's plan to place lower caps on borrowing could push some borrowers into the private lending market, which lacks federal protection and could have higher interest rates.\n\n\"Student debt places a tremendous burden on borrowers, their families, their communities, and the U.S. economy, driving employment, spending, and housing decisions that have long-lasting negative impacts on borrowers' financial health,\" a group of Democratic lawmakers wrote in a letter last year. \"Placing a greater share of student loans into the hands of private lenders threatens to make these problems much worse.\"",

    "description": "You might know Nick Jonas as a musician and Priyanka Chopra as an actor. Together, they're a stylish power couple making their mark on red carpets.",
    "fullText": "Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra Jonas are the definition of a power couple.\n\nSince 2017, the 33-year-old musician and 43-year-old actor have consistently reached new heights in their relationship and respective careers.\n\nThey've also remained one of the most stylish couples in Hollywood. Here are the best red-carpet looks they've worn together, from the Met Gala to the Grammys.\n\nThey had their fitting return at a Ralph Lauren event, where Chopra Jonas wore a black, high-neck dress with long sleeves and silver crystal detailing.\n\nJonas, on the other hand, donned a cream suit jacket, a white button-up shirt, a black bow tie, and matching pants.\n\nThey wore several outfits for their multi-day celebration. At their reception in New Delhi, for example, sparkles and velvet stole the show.\n\nChopra Jonas wore a gold lehenga covered in beads and sequins, as well as a dupatta around her arms. Jonas contrasted her light ensemble in a black suit with a velvet jacket.\n\nBoth stars wore black for the event, with Jonas in a traditional tuxedo and Chopra Jonas in a halter dress.\n\nHer garment stood out thanks to its mesh panels, stripes of colorful fabric, and semi-sheer skirt.\n\nOne such look in February 2019 included a brown suit and gray T-shirt worn by Jonas, and a strapless, pink-and-yellow gown worn by Chopra Jonas.\n\nThe latter garment had a sparkling bodice, scoop neckline, and floral skirt with a thigh-high slit.\n\nChopra Jonas chose a black Elie Saab gown for the occasion. It had a plunging halter neckline — which resembled a tuxedo jacket — and a bedazzled, semi-sheer tulle skirt.\n\nJonas stood beside her in a blue Missoni tuxedo, a white button-up shirt, a black bow tie, and a crystal brooch.\n\nAt the 2019 Billboard Music Awards, Chopra Jonas chose a glamorous look designed by Zuhair Murad. Her white, long-sleeved dress had a deep V-neckline, a floor-length skirt with a high slit, and sequins from top to bottom.\n\nJonas' look, on the other hand, was a lot more colorful. He wore a two-piece suit with a madras pattern and blue velvet loafers decorated with tassels.\n\nChopra Jonas stood out in a custom Dior gown with a semi-sheer bodice, a multicolored feather skirt, and a matching cape on the red carpet. She also wore a metal crown, white eyebrows, and sparkling pumps.\n\nJonas' look was also bold. He chose an all-white suit from the same designer and sparkling Louboutin shoes.\n\nThough their after-party outfits were arguably better, there's no denying that they nailed the event's camp theme.\n\nWalking hand in hand on the red carpet, the couple matched in white. Chopra Jonas' Georges Hobeika gown was strapless with a ruffled neckline and tiered skirt, and Jonas' understated tuxedo matched perfectly.\n\nTheir outfits were arguably two of the best worn by celebrities at the festival that year.\n\nTheir evening outfits were the exact opposite of their old Hollywood-inspired daytime looks.\n\nChopra Jonas wore a sleeveless gown seemingly made from chain mail. It had a V-neckline, a wrap skirt, and a thigh-high slit. Jonas' look was also bold and included a copper suit jacket worn over a black top.\n\nChopra Jonas' gown wrapped around her waist and had a hip-high slit, which revealed the shining, fishnet lining underneath.\n\nJonas kept things more casual in a maroon suit with a bomber-style jacket and pants that cinched at the ankles.\n\nChopra Jonas donned a pink, off-the-shoulder gown with a ruched bodice and short train. Cristina Ottaviano designed the look.\n\nJonas was also in attendance wearing a shiny Prada suit with a matching bolo tie.\n\nChopra Jonas wore a cream dress designed by Ralph and Russo. It had a floral print across its skirt, salmon-colored fringe hanging from each sleeve, and a plunging neckline that reached below her stomach.\n\nThough Jonas' look wasn't as daring, it was bold and complemented the gold tones of his wife's gown. He wore a metallic suit and matching dress shoes.\n\nChopra Jonas went for sultry that night in a golden Dolce and Gabbana gown. The long-sleeved dress had her signature deep neckline, an oversized metal belt, crystals from top to bottom, and a tall slit in its skirt.\n\nJonas' outfit was drastically different: a vibrant, green three-piece with a jacket, a silk shirt, and matching pants.\n\nThe actor wowed in a floral Richard Quinn jumpsuit, which also had a cape-style jacket that extended into a long train.\n\nJonas' black suit with red detailing was simpler, but his shoes were not. He wore red tabi sneakers created by Maison Margiela.\n\nVivienne Westwood designed Chopra Jonas' red corset dress, which was complemented perfectly by her ruby lipstick.\n\nJonas, on the other hand, wore an all-black ensemble that included a high-neck sweater beneath his sharp blazer. He also wore a striking silver watch.\n\nThey walked the red carpet outside the All That Glitters Diwali Ball in New York City wearing coordinated fits.\n\nZuhair Murad designed Chopra Jonas' crystal-covered pants and jacket set, which she paired with a tulle halter top.\n\nJonas' matching sherwani and trousers were the work of designer Anita Dongre.\n\nThey attended the premiere of \"The Bluff\" in Hollywood to celebrate Chopra Jonas' role in the film. Both wore shades of brown.\n\nThe musician paired burnt-orange trousers with a matching button-up top and a tweed jacket in cool-toned shades. He also wore a white T-shirt and black dress shoes.\n\nChopra Jonas, however, took a more dramatic approach. Her chocolate-brown gown had a leather halter bodice and a wrap skirt that was short in front and long across the floor.\n\n\"The Bluff\" costume designer Antoinette Messam said on Instagram that Chopra Jonas' premiere outfit was made from part of a costume she wore in her coming film.",

    "description": "\"Everyone has an incredible amount of agency,\" said X product head Nikita Bier. \"We come up with an idea, we build it in a week, and it's out.\"",
    "fullText": "One of Elon Musk's lieutenants at X is sharing what it's like to work in the trenches with him.\n\nThere are some trademarks of a Musk company, whether it be Tesla, SpaceX, or xAI. His teams are flat, his schedule is jam-packed, and his expectations are high. In the lead-up to a big launch, expect to grind out some long hours.\n\nX's head of product, Nikita Bier, recently opened up about working under Musk on the \"Out of Office\" podcast, contrasting it with his past work at Silicon Valley staples like Discord and Meta.\n\nBier described a \"very flat organization\" with lots of individual contributors reporting directly to Musk himself. There are very few managers, Bier said.\n\n\"Everyone has an incredible amount of agency,\" Bier said. \"We come up with an idea, we build it in a week, and it's out.\"\n\nBier also said that Musk was \"deep in the weeds.\" That's a feat for an executive who runs multiple companies (and once a government agency) at the same time.\n\n\"He does weekly reviews basically with every engineer at the company,\" Bier said. \"You have one or two slides, you present what you got done that week, he gives feedback.\"\n\nWhile some social media commenters expressed skepticism that every engineer received a weekly review, Musk is clearly hands-on — as evidenced by another xAI employee's podcast appearance.\n\nSulaiman Ghori worked on xAI's Macrohard team. He described flat teams, few managers — and a wager between Musk and an employee on how quickly he could set up a rack of GPUs. The employee won himself a Cybertruck. (Ghori, who also talked about the company's \"carnival company\" permit workaround for building data centers, announced he was no longer at xAI four days after the podcast was published.)\n\nBier also described a lean but efficient team that had \"like 30 core product engineers.\"\n\n\"The size of the engineering team is equivalent to a feature when I worked at Facebook,\" Bier said. \"It's essentially operating like a startup.\"\n\nOn X, one user asked whether these 30 employees were on the product or design team. Bier responded: \"Engineers, 2 designers, 1.5 product managers and me.\"\n\nIt's difficult to compare engineering team sizes to the pre-Musk Twitter days — or even discern which \"core\" team Bier is referencing. After six months of ownership, Musk cut Twitter's staff by 90%. Five hundred engineers remained at the time.\n\nWhat Bier didn't realize before working with Musk, he said, was that the executive will \"always do the hard things.\" Consumer product builders are often looking for quick wins, Bier said. Musk chooses the most important — and difficult — thing to do, he said, from rebuilding the algorithm to building data centers.\n\nThat also means: Don't expect a lazy Friday at X.\n\n\"Every morning, every day, there's a new crisis,\" Bier said. \"I'll just open my phone and be like: 'Oh my god.'\"",

    "description": "Yoshua Bengio, known as a \"godfather of AI\" alongside fellow computer scientists like Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun, said education \" isn't just about acquiring the skills to get a job.\"",
    "fullText": "Is there any value in going to college when AI is expected to fundamentally reshape white-collar work?\n\nYes, according to Yoshua Bengio.\n\nOn Monday's episode of the \"Silicon Valley Girl\" podcast, its host Marina Mogilko asked Bengio if he would encourage his four-year-old grandson to go to college. Alongside fellow computer scientists Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun, Bengio is known as one of the \"godfathers of AI\" thanks to his pioneering research in deep learning and neural networks.\n\nBengio quickly responded \"yes,\" adding: \"Education is really important, and education, contrary to what some people think, isn't just about acquiring the skills to get a job.\n\n\"Education is, in my opinion, mostly about how to become a better human being, how to understand yourself, how to understand our society and each other.\"\n\nBengio's comments add to the debate on whether it's worth pursuing the traditional college career pathway in a world where AI is matching or bettering humans on a wide range of cognitive tasks.\n\nHinton told a June episode of the \"Diary of a CEO\" podcast that AI may already be making it harder for college graduates to get jobs, and that it's a good time to become a plumber. Stanford professor Fei-Fei Li, nicknamed the \"Godmother of AI,\" told \"The Tim Ferriss Show\" in December that when hiring for her AI startup, a candidate's degree matters less than the tools they can use, including AI.\n\nBengio's comments on Monday echoed what he told \"The Diary of a CEO\" podcast in December, when he said his advice for his four-year-old grandson in our current world is to focus on being a \"beautiful human being.\"\n\n\"I think that part of ourselves will persist even if machines can do most of the jobs,\" he said.",

    "description": "Over four decades after the 1984 Winter Olympics, Sarajevo is contending with what to do with its Olympic venues. Many are abandoned and crumbling.",
    "fullText": "Over 40 years ago, the Yugoslavian city of Sarajevo hosted the 1984 Winter Olympics. Many new structures were built, and the Games were seen as something of a reunion since many countries had boycotted the 1980 Summer Olympics held in Moscow.\n\nBut six years later, the country would be thrown into turmoil during the Yugoslav Wars, which led to the fall of Yugoslavia. Sarajevo became the capital of a new country, Bosnia and Herzegovina, in 1992, but the fighting didn't end until 2001.\n\nDuring the fighting, Olympic venues became battlegrounds, with ski slopes heavily mined and hotels turned into prisons.\n\nWhile Sarajevo's story is singular, it's not the only former Olympics host city where venues now resemble ghost towns. Olympics host countries famously pour millions of dollars into building new venues, which sometimes fall into disrepair after the crowds have gone home.\n\nMilan Cortina, the host of this year's Olympics, hopes to avoid this costly mistake.\n\n\"The Games are capitalizing on existing infrastructure and local winter sports expertise, aiming to create lasting socio-economic benefits for the local population,\" said Marie Sallois, the IOC director for sustainability.\n\nOf the 13 venues being used across northern Italy, 11 either already exist or are set to be torn down after the games. The country only needed to construct two new permanent venues, per the IOC.\n\nHere's what the 1984 Sarajevo Olympic venues look like in 2026.\n\nThe 1984 Games were the first Winter Olympics to be held in a socialist state and the second consecutive Games to be held in a socialist country after the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow.\n\nA destroyed hotel at Mount Igman, where events including ski jumping were held in 1984, is pictured in 2014.\n\nThis is what the bobsled track looked like in 2014 — it's been almost completely left to nature.\n\nSylvia Hui at the Associated Press wrote that year, \"Today, the abandoned concrete construction looks like a skeleton littered with graffiti.\"\n\nNPR reported the Bosnian war led to 100,000 deaths and the \"worst atrocities in Europe since World War II.\"\n\nAccording to Getty, 10 years after the Winter Olympics, \"the hotel was turned into a prison and place of execution for Bosnian Muslims — all overseen by Serb Forces.\"\n\nEven the medal podium was turned into an execution site, Bloomberg reported.\n\nAccording to Getty, \"The area around the 90-meter hill was heavily mined during the Bosnian war.\"\n\nMoss and debris cover the jumps.\n\nThese Olympic rings have fallen into disrepair.\n\nEast Germany's Jens Weißflog and Finland's Matti Nykänen each took home gold medals in ski jumping that year.\n\n\"The remains of destroyed restaurants, hotels, sports facilities and mountain huts were left to rot and the thousands of mines were cleared at a painstakingly slow pace\" after the war ended, The Guardian wrote in 2018.\n\nA photo from 2015 shows downhill bikers using the bobsled tracks for training.\n\nThe walls are covered in tags and street art.\n\nThe track on Mount Trebević was covered in snow when it was photographed in January 2018.\n\nThe cable car follows the same route today as it did during the Olympics.\n\n\"The mountain has slowly returned to something like its former self,\" The Guardian wrote in 2018. \"Hotels, restaurants and cafes have been rebuilt, mines swept away and hikers from all over Sarajevo visit en masse.\"\n\nA wartime cemetery was built right next to the Zetra Olympic Hall.\n\nFollowing the war, the Zetra Ice Hall was rebuilt in 1997 and reopened in 1999. It's still in use and is now known as the Juan Antonio Samaranch Olympic Hall.\n\nIn 2024, some of the slopes remain abandoned. Olympics branding, like these rings, was still visible.\n\nUnfortunately, Sarajevo isn't the only city that has to reckon with abandoned Olympic venues. There are empty stadiums all over the world.",

    "fullText": "\"What did you do today?\" my superager grandmother Rosine, nicknamed Neni, asks me almost as soon as she picks up the phone on our nightly chats.\n\nAt 95, Neni lives on her own in the sunlit condo she bought as a widow in her fifties. Her main complaints are fatigue, hip pain, insomnia, and swelling in her ankles, mostly due to a heart that's running out of lifetime. Still, she plows through her roster of self-imposed tasks as though her worth depends on the state of her carpets and cabinets.\n\nShe still bakes, speaks up at condo board meetings, scrubs her floors on her bony knees, and climbs atop her rickety rattan chairs to dust a chandelier that doesn't need much dusting. She makes her bed every morning, no matter how badly she slept and still wants to sleep, careful not to leave a single crease in her comforter.\n\nBut no matter how much she handles, she gets down and defeated because she's not like \"before.\" Neni is both tireless and tired.\n\nWe've always been close, but we've become closer in recent years since we discovered we have \n\nI shouldn't be able to relate to Neni's frustrations about not doing enough and not being the person she used to be, but I do. I see myself in the way she slams into her chair, a controlled descent too difficult to orchestrate with joints and nerves out of tune. I see myself in her curved spine, backed-up bowels, and anxiety.\n\nShe's 55 years older than me, except that I've aged before aging. Like Neni, I had a hysterectomy in my late 30s. Like her, the anemia that keeps me breathless has more to do with marrow than menstruation. We share the same cancer genes, the same allergies, the same immune system dysfunction.\n\nI've had to reboot my career after my Ph.D. to accommodate an illness that won't leave. I know how unsettling it feels to plant new offshoots while mourning the roots that rotted away.\n\nWe've become unlikely companions, brought together by the bodies that fail us.\n\nNeni and I confide in each other. We vent about our incontinence and maddeningly itching skin. I understand her when she says she doesn't recognize herself in the mirror, doesn't fit into her pants, can't bridge the gap between want and can. I never knew, before this, how much grief aging and chronic illness share.\n\n\"Are you constipated?\" she asks me at least twice a week. She reminds me not to lift anything heavy, to have a banana for potassium, and not to overwater the plant she gave me.\n\nSometimes she asks me, \"Is lasting living?\"\n\nShe's not only outlasted her husband but also most of the people she's known and loved. She's left behind a country, a language she once spoke fluently, and a craft her hands can no longer do. As immigrants, success meant enduring, sweeping pain under the rug to adapt and belong. But resilience has a downside: the stronger you are, the stronger you're expected to be.\n\nTogether, we've practiced pacing ourselves rather than pushing beyond our limits and paying for it later. Neni has always believed that rest is lazy, even when it's earned. Now, she's beginning to let herself nap to replenish her precious energy.\n\nIn turn, she's been teaching me about resourcefulness and patience, and about how worthwhile things take the time they need. An avid gardener who nurses plants back to health and distributes thriving offshoots to her neighbors, she reminds me that blooms happen on their own schedule and seasons can't be rushed.\n\n\"Don't be afraid,\" she tells me when the uncertainty with my health, my creativity, and surrogacy has me feeling unsteady. She reminds me that hard work and a little magic (but especially her prayers) go a long way.\n\nAs anxious as I am about her leaving and my aging, I know this bond we have is sacred. I also know she's doing much more than just \"lasting;\" she's in her space, with her music and her recipes, running her home as best as she can, even if her best fluctuates. Her resolve is stronger than her heartbeat.\n\nShe reminds me every day that there's pride in organizing a home and finding comfort in order, rituals, light, and togetherness. These small acts of survival might just be our greatest legacy.",

    "description": "Levittown in Long Island, New York, was built in 1947 as a suburban community for America's growing families. Here's what it was like in the '50s.",
    "fullText": "As World War II came to an end, families looked for ways to start over. Emboldened by the GI Bill's provisions for home loans, they moved out of the cities in droves for newly developed suburban communities.\n\nIn fact, the suburbs expanded by 47% during the 1950s, according to the Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History.\n\nLevittown in Long Island, New York, was one of the first to introduce the idea of a pre-planned, mass-produced uniform suburban community, The New York Times reported. Families started moving there on October 1, 1947.\n\nThough the community welcomed an influx of families, non-white prospects weren't allowed. Notably, African Americans didn't see the same benefits from the GI Bill, and it would take some years before racial and ethnic minorities broadly shifted to the suburbs.\n\nHere's what it was like to live in America's first modern suburb in the 1950s.\n\nAt the time, most people lived close to the city center to work in factories, or they lived in rural communities to work on farms, according to economist Jay Zagorsky.\n\nThe 1950 Census found that 60% of people lived in cities, while 40% lived in the suburbs.\n\nThanks to factors like the construction of highways, the development of new neighborhoods from farmland, and even safety in the event of an atomic attack, these percentages would soon shift drastically.\n\nThe GI Bill provided each returning soldier with benefits designed to stimulate economic growth. Each soldier was given a year of unemployment and free tuition to go to college. The military pledged to back all home loans, which allowed veterans to buy houses with little to no down payments.\n\nShortly after WWII ended, the Baby Boom began. In 1946, 3.4 million babies were born, more than ever before, and 20% more than in 1945, per History.com. This trend continued into the '50s.\n\nMost historians think it was because Americans were eager to have families after having postponed marriage and childbirth because of the Great Depression and World War II.\n\nWhatever the reason, people flocked to the suburbs to accommodate their growing families.\n\nDuring the war, factories focused on creating wartime essentials, like airplanes and barracks. In the '50s, they refocused their efforts on building home components and automobiles using the new practices — like the assembly line — they implemented in the war,\n\nAs a result, factories were able to produce materials for homes faster than ever before.\n\nLevitt and Sons, a construction company, purchased a 7-square-mile plot of potato and onion farms in Long Island in 1947. They set out to build one of the first uniform suburban communities in the US.\n\nTo construct the new community, which sits about 30 miles east of Manhattan, Levitt and Sons hired mostly unskilled workers to build the homes. They gave each a specific skill and created a sort of human assembly line. William Levitt even called his firm \"the General Motors of the housing industry,\" The Guardian reported.\n\nThe Levitts eventually constructed 17,447 houses between 1947 and 1951. During the peak of the construction boom, one was built every 16 minutes.\n\nThe first homes in Levittown cost new residents around $7,000, The Guardian reported. For veterans, there was no down payment.\n\nWhen adjusting for inflation, a Levittown home in 1950 would be roughly $97,000 in today's money.\n\nAt first, all the homes were built in the same style, and some residents even admitted to walking into the wrong house at times because they couldn't tell them apart, according to Khan Academy, citing Kenneth T. Jackson's \"Crabgrass Frontier: The Suburbanization of the United States.\"\n\nEach home in Levittown sat on a 6,000-square-foot lot, The New York Times reported.\n\nWith the growing number of children, outdoor spaces became increasingly important to the suburban neighborhood.\n\nAt first, they were modest homes, but most families saw their new suburban lives as luxurious.\n\nMany Levittown homeowners learned homeownership responsibilities, such as tending to a lawn.\n\nThe suburb helped cement the idea of the \"nuclear family\" in American culture.\n\nThere were also swimming pools that children could use during the summer.\n\nSince the streets in the suburban neighborhood were considered safer than those in the city, parents used to allow children to bike around by themselves, per the National Center for Safe Routes to School.\n\nThe mortgage on a home in Levittown was reportedly about $29 per month, while most paid $90 per month in the city.\n\nThe community has over 17,000 homes, making it one of the largest private housing projects in the history of the US.\n\nSuburban home construction boomed in the 1950s. In fact, at least 15 million units were under construction by the end of the decade, according to the Wealth Management Group.\n\nFor years, there were rules that restricted minorities from buying homes in Levittown, and even as the Civil Rights Movement was starting to take form and the rest of the country began integrating after Brown v Board of Education in 1954, Levittown remained mostly white.\n\nTwo-thirds of Levittown residents today are white, according US Census estimates.\n\nIn 1952, William Cotter, a Black man, and his family, sublet a home at 26 Butternut Lane. When the lease was up, Levitt refused to renew it or sell them the home.\n\nThe refusal sparked support for the Cotters, and the family eventually purchased another home from a white homeowner.\n\nThe suburban boom corresponded with the expansion of interstate highways in the US, starting the modern iteration of the commute from the suburbs to the city.\n\nIn 1950, 80% of men in Levittown commuted to Manhattan for work, The Guardian reported.\n\nWhen men left to fight in WWII, women began entering the workforce, gaining newfound independence and freedom. However, they were suddenly expected to give this up again and instead focus on childbearing and rearing.\n\nIn 1963, author Betty Friedan wrote in \"The Feminine Mystique\" that the suburbs \"were burying women alive.\" However, some believe that women's dissatisfaction with staying home \"contributed to the rebirth of the feminist movement in the 1960s,\" History.com reported.\n\nIn 1959, women of Levittown, with children in hand, protested in favor of putting stop signs in an area with automobile-related deaths.\n\nAs American politics increasingly centered on anticommunism and Cold War tensions rose, Levittown and suburbs like it took on a symbolic meaning in American culture, representing prosperity and the \"American Dream.\"\n\nLevitt was once quoted saying, \"No man who owns his own house and lot can be a Communist. He has too much to do.\"\n\nIn 2026, Levittown is still a sizable community with a population of about 50,000. Though it's full of modern businesses and technology, the community still holds a legacy as a post-war suburban haven.",

    "description": "Coffee prices in the US have continued to rise, even after Trump walked back some tariff threats against major coffee-producing nations.",
    "fullText": "Inflation may be cooling, but there's one part of Americans' routines that isn't yet feeling relief: a morning cup of coffee.\n\nCoffee was among the commodities hit by Donald Trump's tariff policies last year, with prices continuing to rise in 2026. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the average price of coffee across the US reached $9.37 per pound in January, a 33% increase since last year.\n\nThe 33% increase has pushed coffee bean prices to their highest level since the 1980s, when data on the commodity were first collected. Yet, while costs in the US have surged, they've actually fallen on a global scale, dropping to $3.64 per pound in January.\n\nTariffs on imports from Brazil are part of the reason they're still high in the US, but they don't fully explain the disconnect.\n\nGlobally, the combination of a positive supply outlook for the coming year, as previous production shortfalls start to ease, is keeping a lid on international coffee prices.\n\nMeanwhile, a split between the US and the rest of the world has been taking shape for a while.\n\nCoffee shops began raising prices following Trump's sweeping Liberation Day tariffs. This included levying a 46% tariff against Vietnam and 10% tariffs against Brazil and Colombia, the three nations that account for more than 60% of the US's coffee supply.\n\nIn July, Trump moved to impose a 40% tariff on Brazilian imports of food and beverages, a policy that was set to spike the cost of coffee. He ultimately walked the decision back in November, but the impact is still being felt in coffee markets.\n\nImporters typically lock in prices months in advance. As such, Trump's rollback of tariffs on major coffee producers likely hasn't yet shown up in prices.\n\nWhile it's true that the post-tariff discount could be felt in the coming months, it doesn't mean prices will come down, especially as consumers seem willing to pay higher prices at the moment. Leading coffee stocks such as Starbucks and Keurig Dr. Pepper have performed well in 2026, rising 14% and 5% year to date, respectively.",

Gartner expects global AI cybersecurity spending to hit $51 billion in 2026, roughly doubling from the year prior.\n\nWedbush highlighted three stocks as the best-positioned in the space: Palo Alto Networks, CrowdStrike, and Zscaler.\n\nWhat Wedbush says: \"We believe that CRWD's position as the gold standard of cybersecurity remains firmly unchanged in the face of this software sell-off with the company's innovative, best-in-class Falcon platform becoming increasingly effective in the modern threat landscape as AI adversaries become an incrementally larger threat for enterprises heading down the AI path.\"\n\nWhat Wedbush says: '\"AI is not displacing PANW's value proposition, but has actually made it more relevant, not less, as it is forcing customers to consolidate vendors, improve visibility, and automate response as threats become more adaptive and effective.\"\n\nWhat Wedbush says: \"AI is amplifying the need to secure access to data, models, and applications everywhere, reinforcing the mission-critical nature of ZS's offering, driving durable subscription growth and high renewal visibility.\"",

    "description": "After visiting all 20 regions of Italy, my favorite for food is Emilia-Romagna. This region has incredible cheese, truffles, tomatoes, and tortellini.",
    "fullText": "It's no secret that Italy has some of the world's best food. However, after visiting all 20 regions, I've learned that the country isn't one-size-fits-all when it comes to dining in la dolce vita.\n\nEach region has niche dishes and products that locals wear like a badge of honor, like mozzarella di bufala from Campania, pesto alla Genovese from Liguria, and arancini from Sicily.\n\nAlthough I would gladly choose to eat anywhere in Italy over any city in the US, Emilia-Romagna gets the gold for the best cuisine in the country.\n\nFrom Parmigiano-Reggiano and balsamic vinegar of Modena to Prosciutto di Parma and mortadella from Bologna, Emilia-Romagna is home to some of Italy's most beloved exports.\n\nThese are just a few of the products that are PDO and PGI-certified. This is a high standard in the world of food that signals an official link between a product and a region. Emilia-Romagna has 44 PDO and PGI products in total — more than any other Italian region.\n\nYou'll also find some of the country's most famous restaurants here, like Osteria Francescana and Al Gatto Verde in Modena, and Trattoria da Amerigo in Savigno.\n\nBeyond the accolades and fancy titles, though, I believe that what makes Emilia-Romagna's cuisine a standout is simply the care and attention put into the food I've had here. After visiting the region at least twice a year for the past six years, I have yet to have even a subpar meal.\n\nIn Italy, some regions just do certain products better. For example, Tuscany is famous for its red wine; meanwhile, many head to Piedmont for truffles, and Campania's tomatoes are top-notch.\n\nHowever, Emilia-Romagna really has a city or town for everything you could ever want on your plate. Savigno has a sign when entering that says \"Cittá del Tartufo,\" which quite literally translates to \"City of Truffles.\"\n\nA visit to Appennino Food Group, a food production group explicitly known for its truffle exports, is a great way to plan an afternoon of truffle hunting with trained pups. The company was founded by Luigi Dattilo, who, at 17, refused his father's offer of a car and asked for a truffle dog instead.\n\nAs for tomatoes, Mutti, the famed canned tomato brand, has its headquarters in Parma. Plus, if you're looking to enjoy Parmigiano-Reggiano in its rightful birthplace, the only place in the world you can do just that is in Emilia-Romagna.\n\nTortellini has some roots here, too. There was a long-standing debate between Modena and Bologna about who made tortellini first. However, a popular legend holds that tortellini originated in Castelfranco Emilia, a small town between the two hubs.\n\nSome Italians theorize that tortellini's shape was inspired by Venus's belly button after she spent a night at an inn in town.\n\nAs someone who constantly craves a taste of Emilia-Romagna — and who spends a lot of time in Italy — I'm in the region often. I love trying new places, but I have a few favorite spots.\n\nOne is Franceschetta58 in Modena, known for its decadent tortellini en Parmigiana crema dish (where, yes, I do lick the plate clean every single time). For something more traditional, I prefer Sfoglia Rina in Bologna for tortellini en brodo.\n\nIn Parma, Salumeria Garibaldi is an ideal spot for a sip of Lambrusco, the region's most famed wine, paired with bites of prosciutto and mostarda.\n\nMeanwhile, an hour and a half away in Ferrara, check out Al Brindisi, a historic wine bar dating back to 1435, making it the world's oldest.\n\nDespite its prominent history, Al Brindisi has an unfussy feel, still preserving its medieval charm in a warm, welcoming atmosphere. Pro tip: Order the cappellacci di zucca, or pumpkin-stuffed pasta, a staple of Ferrarese cuisine.",

    "fullText": "I didn't know what to expect when I first visited Colombia, but my eight-day stay in the country was warm, beachy, and something out of a dream.\n\nAfter browsing dozens of travel blogs and asking friends for their recommendations, my partner and I crafted an itinerary that we hoped would give us a nice mix of relaxation and adventure.\n\nWe spent three nights in Cartagena, the country's port city off the Caribbean coast. Then, for another two nights, we unwound in ​​​​Isla Barú, a beachy peninsula about an hour away from Cartagena.\n\nWe concluded our trip with two nights in Medellín, the country's second-largest city, nestled within the Andes Mountain range.\n\nAlthough I had a fantastic trip, there are definitely things I could've done better when planning our itinerary and exploring the country.\n\nIt's standard practice to carry some cash when traveling, but in all three cities I visited, I found myself needing a little more than I had expected.\n\nAlthough the larger malls and more upscale restaurants accepted credit cards, many smaller shops and street vendors were cash-only.\n\nThere were also a few other snags that made us wish we had cash on hand. We took the local train around Colombia, and even though we planned to pay by card, it just so happened that the card reader at one station was down — and the nearby ATM's fee was even higher than our ticket cost.\n\nBottom line: Next time I travel to South America, I'll take out more cash than I think I'll need.\n\nMany travel guides recommend visiting the Rosario Islands, an archipelago of over 20 islands about an hour's boat ride off the coast of Cartagena.\n\nOf the islands, we'd heard that the most popular destinations for tourists include Isla Grande and Isla Barú. We chose the latter, and spent two nights there.\n\nBarú definitely lived up to the hype. The crystal-clear water and white-sand beaches made me feel like I was in paradise, and it was surprisingly just as nice when the weather was overcast.\n\nNot to mention, the seafood was extremely fresh, and it only made our trip better.\n\nAlthough we enjoyed the downtime, we didn't feel there was enough to do on Barú aside from lounging on the beach. Compared to a few of the other places we visited, there weren't many shops, restaurants, or bars.\n\nAs beautiful as it was, we found ourselves a little bored by the end of the stay there. In hindsight, a short day trip would've been the perfect amount of time to explore everything Barú had to offer.\n\nWe didn't properly account for the travel time between our second and final destinations, so unfortunately, we only had two nights in Medellín. It was nowhere near enough time.\n\nIn the time we did have here, I visited the Botanical Garden of Medellín and the Museum of Antioquia. I also explored the city through its cable-car system, which offered stunning aerial views of the city's mountainside neighborhoods.\n\nOf the three places I visited, I felt like Medellín had the most to do, and I wish I'd been able to explore spots like the El Castillo Museum and Gardens, the Medellín Museum of Modern Art, Parque Arví, and Mercado Del Río.\n\nAt a minimum, I would've loved to spend at least four full days in the city.\n\nColombia is one of the most biodiverse countries in the world, so seeing the country's natural beauty is a must.\n\nAlthough we were able to experience the beautiful islands and had a breath of fresh air at the botanical gardens, I would've loved to see more of the country's nature and wildlife.\n\nAs I later found out through conversations with taxi drivers and hotel employees, there are so many nature-based \"off-the-beaten-path\" activities in the country.\n\nNext time I visit, I'm taking a day trip to Guatapé — which supposedly has incredible hiking — and visiting the El Totumo Mud Volcano.\n\nI'd also love to join a coffee-tasting session on a local coffee farm. I can only imagine how good it smells.",

    "description": "Netflix sent TikTok parent ByteDance a cease-and-desist letter to over its AI video tool Seedance, following in Disney and Paramount's footsteps.",
    "fullText": "Netflix isn't amused by ByteDance's new AI video tool.\n\nThe streaming giant sent a cease-and-desist letter to the China-based TikTok parent on Tuesday night, calling its new generative AI model Seedance 2.0 \"a high-speed piracy engine.\"\n\nSeedance turned heads last week after a user created a viral video of people resembling Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt fighting on a rooftop about disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nWhile some were impressed, others panicked, with Deadpool cowriter Rhett Reese writing: \"I hate to say it. It's likely over for us.\"\n\nNetflix said in its letter to ByteDance that the company's AI video tool had also made videos mimicking characters from mega-hit Netflix shows like \"Stranger Things,\" \"Bridgerton,\" and \"Squid Game\" as well as the uber-popular movie \"KPop Demon Hunters.\"\n\n\"The use of copyrighted works to create a competing commercial product, especially one that regurgitates the original, is not protected by fair use,\" Netflix's litigation director wrote.\n\nNetflix urged ByteDance to stop generating AI videos that resemble its IP, and to identify and remove all such videos that have already been created. It also insisted that its IP be taken out of Seedance's training datasets.\n\nA ByteDance spokesperson said the company \"respects intellectual property rights\" and has \"heard the concerns regarding Seedance 2.0.\"\n\n\"We are taking steps to strengthen current safeguards as we work to prevent the unauthorized use of intellectual property and likeness by users,\" the ByteDance spokesperson said.\n\nDisney sent ByteDance a message similar to Netflix's last week. That's notable because Disney reached a deal in December to license iconic characters to OpenAI for its video-generating app Sora.\n\nSeedance is using \"a pirated library of Disney's copyrighted characters from Star Wars, Marvel, and other Disney franchises, as if Disney's coveted intellectual property were free public domain clip art,\" Disney said in its cease-and-desist letter to ByteDance.\n\nNetflix echoed that sentiment, saying it would \"not stand by and watch ByteDance treat our valued IP as free, public domain clip art.\"\n\nParamount Skydance also sent a cease-and-desist letter last week to ByteDance expressing similar concerns, Variety reported.\n\nRead Netflix's letter to ByteDance below:",

    "title": "My Favorite Ways to Upgrade a Shower Without Spending Much Money",
    "description": "You can upgrade your shower without doing a full-on remodel.",
    "fullText": "Soaking in a warm bath can be relaxing, but nothing beats the soothing convenience of a hot shower. Like everything else in your house, your shower will start to show its age long before it stops being useful, leaving you to have a functional but uninspiring experience every day. If you can afford to remodel, that’s not a huge problem. But if you’re stuck with a shower that’s lost its shine and you can’t afford to tear it out and start over, there are a lot of affordable, easy ways to upgrade your shower with just a few purchases and minimal effort.\n\nIf your shower tiles are in good shape but make you sad every time you step in there, you don’t have to rip them out and find a contractor to replace them—just paint them. Using a specific shower-safe product like Rust-Oleum’s Tub and Tile Refinishing Kit, you can make your shower into a fresh, bright space in just a few hours. You’ll need to scrub the shower pretty thoroughly, protect any surfaces you don’t want to paint, and make sure the bathroom is well-ventilated before you get started, but otherwise it’s as easy as painting a wall, and the results can be shockingly good.\n\nIf you’ve never experienced a towel warmer, then I am about to change your life for the better: Stepping out of a shower and wrapping yourself in a warm towel is one of those simple pleasures that can start your day off right. You don’t need to hang anything on the wall or wire-in some fancy towel rack. A freestanding towel warming box like this looks great and keeps those towels (as well as robes, blankets, or even pajamas) at the comfiest temperature possible. It’ll make your daily shower feel more like a spa trip.\n\nIf your shower is storage-poor and you’ve got a collection of gross shampoo and soap bottles on the floor, investing in some corner shelves is an easy way to get organized. You have several options, from metal shelves that fit into the grout lines between tiles to adhesive shelves that simply stick to your walls. Whichever one you choose, you’ll instantly make your shower look neater and feel more coherent.\n\nIf you need storage but adding shelves isn’t possible or practical, a shower caddy is a good solution. A lot of old-school shower caddies are kind of unsightly, especially once they start to rust, or become gunked up with soap scum and mold. An attractive teak caddy that hangs from the showerhead is a nicely upgraded option, though. If you prefer a freestanding option, this unit from Yamazaki is good-looking, simple, and affordable.\n\nIt seems obvious once you think about it: The most crucial aspect of your shower experience is the showerhead itself. Few things are worse than a weak water stream in your morning shower, so if your showerhead has seen better days, swapping it out for a fresh one is an instant (and easy) upgrade. And if you’re going to swap it out, why not go for a spa-like showerhead like this one from Moen that comes with a detachable handheld hose, or perhaps a rainfall showerhead for a luxurious upgrade.\n\nSeating in the shower is a subtle luxury, but once you have a bench in there, you’ll wonder how you lived without one. Not only does a water-resistant teak bench look great, it makes it easier and safer to scrub your legs and feet or shave your legs. It also makes it possible to just turn up the hot water and sit for a few minutes, basking in the heat.\n\nWe often treat showers as chores we have to race through before we tackle our day, but a shower can be a retreat, a few minutes of peace that rejuvenate and motivate. One way to make that happen is to upgrade your shower with a waterproof speaker like this one so you can play some music while you shower. For a more streamlined look, you could consider a showerhead with a built-in speaker so you can enjoy your playlist without cluttering up your shower space.\n\nIf your shower has a curtain, one of the most impactful upgrades is also the cheapest: a curved curtain rod. This does require some basic DIY skills to install, but it’s well worth it: Curved rods hold the curtain out away from you while you shower, ensuring that a slimy curtain never wraps itself around you. It also makes the shower feel larger because you’re not hemmed in as much.\n\nNothing makes a shower look less attractive than a collection of scuzzy plastic shampoo, conditioner, and body wash bottles crammed into a niche. An easy upgrade win is to get those bottles off the floor and out of the niche by hanging them on the wall in neat, efficient dispensers. The Squeezi is a cheap and easy solution: It slides over the shampoo or soap bottle, then affixes to the wall via good old-fashioned suction, so you don’t need to refill dispensers constantly. If you want a more elegant, hotel-like look, this no-drill dispenser is just the ticket.",

    "title": "What People Are Getting Wrong This Week: Is This February an Unusually Lucky Month?",
    "description": "February's a short month but it tends to be long on myth.",
    "fullText": "We're heading toward the back half of February—and according to your weird aunt on Facebook, this is an unusual, maybe magical month. Some say it is a \"miraclein,\" a lucky calendar configuration that only occurs once every 823 years. Others say February 2026 is a \"perfect month.\" Some say it is the beginning of an extremely unlucky year. Some say that a late-month planetary alignment will cause great upheaval.\n\nThough it is not a word used by astronomers (or even astrologers, to my knowledge), some are describing this month as a \"miraclein,\" a month in which every day of the week falls four times during the month. This only happens every 823 years, they say. A variation of the miraclein month has some people calling February \"moneybags\" and making the claim that it's a good month for abundance. (The markets don't agree: February has been volatile.)\n\nHere's a video explaining the theory:\n\nA quick check of a calendar reveals that miracleins happen almost every year. Every day of the week falls exactly four times every February (except leap years), because four times seven is 28, and there are 28 days in the month. It's not a miracle—it's math. It's not even new. People spread this every February. This is an example of a pervasive strain of myths and superstitions based on the calendar.\n\nIf you dig a little deeper into the lore of February 2026, you'll find people describing it as a \"perfect month,\" in that it begins on a Sunday and ends on a Sunday. There's logic to this, because the calendar is a perfect grid, with no days overhanging. This is nice and orderly, but it's not that unusual. February 2015 was a \"perfect\" month and February 2037 will be perfect as well.\n\nThe \"miraclein\" and perfect month only exist because that's how we decided to write calendars, but there is a cosmic event happening this month that goes beyond humanity. On the 28th of February, six planets—Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—will appear to be \"lined up\" in the sky. Some describe it as a \"once every 6,000 years planetary conjunction\" that will create a \"paradigm shift for the entire planet\" or cause gravitational anomalies. Some warn: \"Do not look at the sky during the planetary alignment;\" other, funnier, people say \"The planets are having some type of conference or gang meeting on February 28.\" But whether you call it a \"conjunction\" or a \"conference,\" it's not rare. Five or six planet line ups happen every few years, and last February, seven planets attended a gang meeting.\n\nThe planets aren't actually lining up, anyway. They'll just look lined up from our perspective on earth. Nothing will happen to your eyes if you look at it (you won't even be able to see Uranus and Neptune without a telescope anyway) and it won't affect gravity or cause a paradigm shift. It's just planets doing their thing in space.\n\nIn 2026, there will be three Friday the 13ths—one just passed in February, one is coming in March, and there's a third in November—this leads some to believe that 2026 is a particularly unlucky or cursed year. Jury's out on whether the year is cursed, but if so, it's not because of Friday the 13ths. While three is the maximum number of Friday the 13ths that can happen in a calendar year, it's not unusual. There were three Friday the 13ths in 2015, and there will be three in 2037 too.\n\nSpeaking of the 13th, the belief that it's a bad, or unlucky day dates back to 19th-century France, but it's not entirely clear why people think it's unlucky. One guess is that Judas was the 13th apostle, but there's also a Norse myth about Loki showing up to as the thirteenth guest at a dinner party and doing mischief. Other cultures have other unlucky days. The 4th is unlucky in China. In Italy, the 17th is unlucky because XVII can be rearranged to form \"VIXI,\" Latin for \"my life is over,\" a common inscription on tombstones. The through-line is that none of these superstitions have anything to do with the physical world. They're examples of seeing connections where none exist.\n\nI don't have research to back this up, but I imagine the Venn diagram of people who believed the Rapture was coming, that Leviathan was rising from the oceans, and aliens were landing has serious overlap with the people who think there's something portentous about the planets aligning or that February is moneybags month. You'd think that when the aliens didn't land and the rapture didn't happen, folks would be more discerning about spreading future predictions, but that doesn't seem to be the case. But it's not just because people are gullible. It's a byproduct of how our brains are wired.\n\nApophenia is the tendency to perceive meaningful connections between unrelated things. Neurologist Klaus Conrad coined the term in a 1958 study of schizophrenics, describing \"a specific feeling of abnormal meaningfulness,\" but apophenia goes beyond schizophrenics. It's in every gambler on a \"lucky streak,\" everyone who sees a \"man in the moon,\" and everyone who ever mistook correlation for causation. So: everyone. Our brains evolved to find patterns in data because it kept us alive and led to things like the scientific method, but the trade-off is that we think a rally cap is going to help our ball club win the series.\n\nApophenia isn't the only thing at play here. Spreading a TikTok video promising abundance is a cranked-up version of Pascal's Wager, the philosophical argument that it’s smarter to bet on a reward when the cost of entry is low—hitting \"share\" takes almost no effort, and what if it works? While none of these beliefs are new, in the Before Times, if you wanted to be a doomsayer, you'd have to stand on a street corner with a sign reading \"the end is near.\" That's a lot of effort and you wouldn't have an algorithm ensuring your message got to the people who would be most receptive to it.\n\nEven misinformation that doesn't promise a monetary reward offers something to the person who spreads it. Sometimes it's the momentary high of feeling like you possess secret knowledge. Or it's a way of signaling belonging to an in-group (\"I'm the kind of person who thinks the position of the stars has mystical significance!\") or maybe it's just to get some attention.\n\nI don't choose to post about \"moneybags February\" because my \"cost of entry\" would be my friends thinking I'm weird for sharing Facebook glurge, and a general sense that it's harmful to spread lies, but really, your weird aunt on Facebook and I are doing the same thing. We're both out here matching patterns and hitting \"share\"; we just have different ideas about which patterns to pay attention to. I'll still take bets on any conspiracy theory, but February is a cold month, and if it warms your aunt's heart to think it's bringing money, who am I to call her wrong? It's just that the same wiring that spreads \"February is magic\" also spreads beliefs and ideas that are legitimately dangerous, even deadly—at least according to the way I read the patterns.",

    "description": "Lyria 3 means Google's AI bot now covers text, code, images, video, and songs.",
    "fullText": "Google Gemini can help you write text, generate images and video, and write code. Now, the AI bot can generate music too, taking on the likes of Suno when it comes to producing tunes from a simple text prompt. The update is courtesy of the new Lyria 3 audio generation model, which is built into Gemini as of today. Developed by Google DeepMind, Lyria has been accessible in other Google products (such as Vertex AI and YouTube Shorts) to a select number of users, but this is the first time Google is making the model widely available to anyone who wants to try it.\n\nLyria works the same way as creating images or video: just describe what you want, and the AI does the rest. You might want to hear \"a comical R&B slow jam about a sock finding their match\" (as per Google's own example), or perhaps \"a sea shanty about the dangers of AI slop\"—it's up to you.\n\nWhen you click the \"Create music\" button inside the Gemini app, you also have the option to pick an existing track to remix, rather than starting from scratch—If you're perhaps stuck for inspiration. These presets cover everything from folk ballads to Latin pop, so you can see the kind of musical scope covered. You can also supply Lyria 3 inside Gemini with an image or video, and get it to compose something that matches the mood of the content you've supplied, including both music and lyrics. The example Google gives is supplying Gemini with a few photos of your dog, and then having it come up with a tune about the pooch and their adventures.\n\nThe tracks are limited to 30 seconds each at the moment, and while music making is available to all Gemini users, if you're paying for the Plus, Pro, or Ultra subscriptions, you'll get higher usage limits (though it isn't specified what these are). As per the official announcement blog post, the aim \"isn't to create a musical masterpiece, but rather to give you a fun, unique way to express yourself.\" You're not going to be able to set up your own AI-generated band on Spotify with this, but you can churn out a few entertaining tracks for your own (or someone else's) amusement.\n\nI haven't been able to try out the feature as of yet, but I have heard a few samples that Google supplied. They come across as rather generic and ordinary, exactly as you might expect something to sound that's the averaging out of vast amounts of audio training data—like song genres distilled into their most common ingredients and repackaged.\n\nGoogle says all created tracks will contain invisible watermarks powered by SynthID, flagging them as AI creations, and you can upload audio tracks to Gemini and run a SynthID check on them. The updated Lyria 3 model is also coming to the Dream Track music maker for YouTube Shorts creators. Lyria 3 is now rolling out inside Gemini, and is available to users aged 18 and above in English, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, and Portuguese. It's available first on the web app, and will show up on the mobile app over the next few days. Expansions in \"quality and coverage\" are planned in the future, Google says.",

    "fullText": "You don’t have to want to live forever (a la the millionaire-immortality-influencer Bryan Johnson) to want to live longer. I’ve seen a larger shift in the fitness industry lately, where a focus on “longevity” has replaced where you might have once seen the words “beach body.” All around us, the language has shifted from \"get shredded\" to \"increase healthspan,\" from \"tone up\" to \"build bone density.\" In this new era, the goal isn't just looking good at the beach, but making sure you can still walk on that beach when you're ninety.\n\nOn its face, this is a welcome change. I’ll always advocate for metrics of success that are less about how you look in a mirror, and more about how well your body functions across decades. At the same time, I’m skeptical of the ways \"metabolic flexibility,\" \"muscle mass preservation,\" and \"inflammation control\" are replacing \"beach body\" in the wellness lexicon. Is this truly progress in how we think about health?\n\nAgain: A fundamental reimagining of why we exercise is not altogether bad. I’m just not convinced that’s what’s happening here. Is this obsession with longevity actually in good faith? Or are we being sold the same old products and insecurities, now wrapped in shiny new scientifically sounding packaging?\n\nBeneath the fresh terminology, much of the longevity fitness advice in my algorithm is pretty familiar. Lift weights, do cardio, eat whole foods, get enough sleep, and manage stress? These are all the same recommendations that have anchored public health guidance for decades.\n\nGoing a little deeper, studies do consistently show that muscle mass is one of the strongest predictors of longevity and independence in older age. Cardiovascular fitness is so strongly correlated with lifespan that some researchers have called it the single best predictor of mortality.\n\n\"Instead of optimizing for short-term aesthetics or peak performance, longevity-focused movement optimizes for metabolic health, hormonal stability, and functional strength over time,\" says Dr. Katheleen Jordan, chief medical officer at Midi Health, a virtual care clinic focused on women in midlife. \"Resistance training preserves muscle mass and bone density, which are critical predictors of fall risk and independence as we age. Muscle mass itself and cardiovascular fitness improves our metabolism and insulin sensitivity.\" This matters especially for women, who face specific challenges as they age. Women lose muscle mass faster than men after menopause and are at higher risk for osteoporosis. Plus, the cultural pressure to stay small has historically steered women away from the heavy lifting that could protect their bone density.\n\n\"Fitness used to often be defined by one number on a scale, so it's exciting to see that we have gone beyond that with a greater understanding that many things define fitness,\" Jordan says. In this way, the longevity fitness framework pushes a truly helpful counter-narrative to diet culture, one where strength is more than just aesthetics.\n\nSo, on one hand, a focus on longevity does feel like progress: valuing strength over skinniness and thinking in decades rather than weeks. On the other hand, it's yet another set of standards to meet, and another source of anxiety about whether you're doing enough.\n\n\"A lot of what's being marketed as new longevity or biohacking is actually reinforcing long trusted ideas around fitness, but with new language,\" Jordan says. This isn't necessarily nefarious—reframing exercise around long-term health rather than short-term aesthetics is genuinely valuable. But it does raise questions about who benefits from this linguistic shift. Often, it's the same wellness industrial complex that previously profited from body insecurity, now profiting from aging anxiety.\n\nIn this way, the fitness industry has found a way to rebrand the same old products—like supplements or wearables—along with hawking some new ones, like direct-to-consumer \"biological age” tests. But even a seemingly legit “biological age” test won’t really give you any actionable insights into living longer. That company will, however, try to sell you a supplement that you certainly don’t need.\n\n\"As with any industry, there are some bad actors and we should be mindful of interventions that promise outsized results,\" Jordan says. \"Healthspan cannot be hacked quickly or swallowed in one pill.” The interventions proven to have some impact on healthspan—exercise, nutrition, sleep, stress management, not smoking—are decidedly unglamorous.\n\nIt’s no surprise that the longevity fitness space is rife with oversimplifications and outright myths. Here are some I kept coming across in my research that warrant skepticism:\n\nThe idea that you can \"biohack\" your way to dramatic life extension. Despite the promises of longevity influencers, there's no evidence that any supplement, cold plunge protocol, or red light therapy device will add decades to your life.\n\nThat more data equals better health. Obsessively tracking every health metric can become counterproductive, leading to stress that ironically undermines the benefits of all the healthy behaviors you're tracking.\n\nThat longevity fitness can compensate for structural inequality. Your zip code is a better predictor of your lifespan than your VO2 max. Access to healthcare, safe places to exercise, fresh food, and economic security matter enormously. Individual optimization can't overcome systemic disadvantage.\n\nSo where does this leave us? The longevity fitness movement contains both genuine progress and, predictably, a lot of repackaged hype. The emphasis on strength, cardiovascular fitness, and metabolic health rests on solid science. And the shift from pure aesthetics to actual health-focused goals is meaningful, particularly for women escaping a lifetime of diet culture.\n\nBut this shift isn’t perfect. In many ways, “healthspan” allows us to talk about the same old snake oil supplements and unattainable beauty standards, just with fancier language. It’s yet another arena for optimization, full of expensive and often unnecessary interventions.\n\nI recommend a middle ground. Embrace the core insights of longevity fitness—that exercise is about building a resilient, capable body for the long haul—while rejecting the anxiety and consumerism that often accompany it. Because in the end, what's the point of extending your healthspan if you spend all those extra healthy years anxiously monitoring whether you're doing it right?",

    "title": "Google's Pixel 10a Isn't Much of an Upgrade From the Pixel 9a",
    "description": "Google's newest phone looks great, but is barely an upgrade.",
    "fullText": "Early every year, Google releases a budget-oriented a-series phone that acts like a stripped down version of its latest mainline Pixel phone. The Pixel 9a, for instance, had the same chip as the Pixel 9, reduced memory and camera specs, and most importantly, a slimmed down design that finally ditched the obtrusive camera bar. The Pixel 10a, announced today, is a bit of an outlier. Instead of upgrading to the same chip as the Pixel 10, it also has the same chip as the Pixel 9, with only slight improvements to everything else that was already in the Pixel 9a. So, is it worth an upgrade?\n\nThe Pixel 10a's specs are, on paper, nearly identical to the Pixel 9a's. Both phones have a Tensor G4 processor, 8GB of RAM, and up to 256GB of storage. They also have the same camera system, with a 48MP main lens, a 13MP ultrawide lens, and a 13MP selfie camera. Battery life also sits at the same promised 30+ hours, with a typical 5,100 mAh capacity (although charging speeds are about 3W faster, for both wired and wireless). The only real difference on paper is that the 6.3-inch screen is a little brighter, with up to 3,000 nits of peak brightness instead of 2,700. The bezels are also supposed to look about 10% thinner, although I needed to be told that to spot it during a hands-on session with the Pixel 10a.\n\nEven the Pixel 10's MagSafe-like Pixelsnap feature is gone, meaning you won't be able to use this phone with any magnetic accessories, at least without adhesive magnets or special third-party cases.\n\nThat said, there are a few changes to the hardware, notably to the look of the phone. Like the Pixel 9a, the Pixel 10a also ditches the camera bar, and evolves on Google's last budget model for a completely flat back. That means the rear camera has no bump or lip to it at all, for a completely flush and seamless feel. It's definitely clean, but the 9a's miniscule camera bump was already barely an inconvenience back when I reviewed it.\n\nMeanwhile, you'd need to be told about the other design upgrades to appreciate them. Google says the Pixel 10a has improved Corning Gorilla Glass 7i cover glass so that it's more resilient to drops and scratches, but I couldn't test that while carefully handling the company's demo units.\n\nEssentially, when looking at raw specs, the Pixel 10a comes across at first less like a stripped down version of the Pixel 10, and more like another iteration of the Pixel 9. But Google's hoping its software can win you over.\n\nThe Pixel 10a does differ from the Pixel 9a when it comes to AI, and introduces two AI camera features that debuted on the main-series Pixel 10. These are Auto Best Take and Camera Coach, although one of them is also an iteration on something that came out alongside the Pixel 8.\n\nThat would be Auto Best Take. Essentially, what this does is detect when you're in a group shot with other people, then take up to 150 frames all in one press. It'll then intelligently find the best shot from those frames and ditch the rest, and if it can't find a good shot, it'll stitch together elements from multiple shots so that everyone has their eyes open. You will know when a shot has been stitched together using Auto Best Take (it'll have a Gemini icon), and can choose to use a non-AI assisted one if you prefer. The ability to stitch together photos is a few generations behind at this point, but not having to choose when to load it up is convenient, if you're into AI-generated photos.\n\nIf you're not, Camera Coach lets you get some AI assistance in your photos without actually having AI in your shots. Essentially, this will look through your camera for you, generate an ideal shot for you to take, then guide you through the real-world steps you need to follow to recreate it. You're essentially handing off the ideation part of photography to Gemini, but you also won't have to risk any hallucinations popping up in your pics.\n\nAside from new photography features, you've also got Satellite SOS for the first time on an a-series phone. This lets you connect to a Satellite if you're away from wifi or your mobile network, so you can ping emergency services for help if you need it. Hopefully, you'll never actually have to use this feature, but it is some great piece of mind.\n\nLike the Pixel 9a, the Pixel 10a is $500, so if you're trying to choose between the two and aren't buying a 9a at a discount secondhand, it's a no-brainer. It does also have a new selection of colors, including a poppy red \"berry\" look and a purplish blue hue named Lavender.\n\nBut if you've already got a Pixel 9a and are eyeing an upgrade, it's a bit harder to justify. The biggest new additions are all software, and Google has already brought previously Pixel 10-exclusive software to older phones before (although with mixed results). That means the 9a is likely to stay relevant for a good few more years, and may actually eventually have all the same features as the 10a, minus that completely flush back.\n\nThe standard Pixel 10 series is also likely to remain a good choice. Back when I reviewed it, I thought the 9a was better than the Pixel 9, but since the 10a doesn't even have the same chip as the regular Pixel 10, it's much less likely to be able to stand in for it, however clean it looks.\n\nIf that doesn't deter you, though, you can pre-order the Pixel 10a now on Google's website, with models set to ship out and hit retail stores on March 5.",

    "description": "Without a manager while languishing in eighth place in the Scottish Premiership, Aberdeen's season rests on their Scottish Cup last-16 tie with Motherwell.",
    "fullText": "Scottish Cup: Aberdeen v Motherwell\n\nLive commentary on BBC Sounds and BBC Radio Scotland Extra, follow updates on BBC Sport app and website.\n\nLast season, the Scottish Cup was Aberdeen's salvation. Nine months on from lifting the trophy, they are facing the same scenario.\n\nWithout a permanent manager and languishing in eighth place in the Scottish Premiership, they are 11 points off the top six never mind the European places.\n\nThe club have churned through a manager, a sporting director, and plenty of players since the summer, fielding four debutants in defeat by Motherwell on Sunday.\n\nThey face the same opposition in Wednesday's re-arranged Scottish Cup last-16 tie which now has the feel of a season-defining game.\n\nWin, and the club have a quarter-final against second-tier Dunfermline Athletic to look forward to as they aim to defend the game's oldest trophy.\n\nLose, and a desperate top-six charge is all they will have left as well as a host of questions about the club's direction.\n\nGiven the importance of the game, Aberdeen would rather be facing almost anyone else than Motherwell - their kryptonite this season.\n\nThe sides have already met four times and Aberdeen have mustered just one goal in those games, losing three of them.\n\nRegan Charles-Cook's winner at Pittodrie in September sent Motherwell on their way to the semi-finals of the League Cup and halted Aberdeen's charge.\n\nSunday's victory at Fir Park was just the latest example of how far ahead Jens Berthel Askou's side are of Aberdeen.\n\nThey created enough chances to be out of sight. Which in league terms they are, 19 points and four places clear of the Dons, to be precise.\n\nThe only consolation for Aberdeen's interim management team of Peter Leven and Tony Docherty was their side did at least threaten in the second half.\n\nToyosi Olusanya hit the post when he should have equalised, Kevin Nisbet also struck the frame of the goal before the break, while Liam Morrison should have buried a header.\n\nThat is a small win for Aberdeen amid a poor run, as well as the fact the rematch is at Pittodrie.\n\n\"Aberdeen created a number of chances,\" former Heart of Midlothian midfielder Michael Stewart told the BBC's Scottish Football Podcast.\n\n\"It wasn't from having great control in the game, but they definitely looked more threatening.\n\n\"The Scottish Cup is the be all and end all for them really now. They're the holders and being at home is a huge positive for them. If they were going to Fir Park again I'd say I don't see them being able to get a result.\n\n\"But at home, possibly. But the way Motherwell play, they are like a title contender.\n\n\"You'd regard them as like a Celtic of recent seasons - controlling and dominating a game and creating opportunities. That's how I see them.\"\n\nTwo years ago Derek McInnes' Kilmarnock side came to Pittodrie 14 points above Neil Warnock's winless Aberdeen and came unstuck in the Scottish Cup, and Leven then came close to leading them all the way to the final. So there is hope.\n\nBut Motherwell will travel north unbeaten in eight matches knowing they are better than their opponents as they seek to add a Scottish Cup tilt to their impressive league showing of fourth place so far.\n\nIf Aberdeen were to become just the fifth team to defeat the Steelmen this season, it would not only send them through to the quarter-finals but build some much-needed confidence around the club and the interim management team.\n\nPodcast: What is going on at Aberdeen?\n\nThe alternative is altogether more bleak. Firstly it would put the club's search for a new manager firmly in the spotlight.\n\nNew sporting director Lutz Pfannenstiel has been taking the reins and, after it was confirmed Docherty would be returning to Pittodrie to help Leven last week, the German said they hoped to announce a new head coach \"imminently\".\n\nThat is widely expected to be the former SK Brann and Saint-Etienne manager Eirik Horneland, who would take charge in the summer, reports suggest., external\n\nAssuming that deal gets done, and it has yet to be confirmed, it still raises the question of whether Aberdeen should have got someone else in earlier.\n\nWhen Jimmy Thelin was sacked on 4 January, the club were only two points from the top six and with the Scottish Cup to defend.\n\nSix weeks on and they are 11 points off sixth-place Falkirk, albeit with two games in hand after terrible weather wreaked havoc with the Pittodrie pitch.\n\nAppearing to write off the last few months of a season has been a familiar feeling for Aberdeen fans in the last five years.\n\nLeven, in his third spell in interim charge, will have managed 18 league matches by the end of this campaign and 29 in total if he has to see out the season.\n\nThat is as many as Stephen Glass (29) and only just behind Jim Goodwin (35) and Barry Robson (36) - three of the club's last four permanent bosses, and the last four were all dismissed in January or February.\n\nSeason-ticket holders could justifiably feel short-changed - despite plenty of investment in the playing squad - as another campaign seeps away before the clocks change.\n\nSeven new faces arrived in January to try to arrest the slide, taking the total number of players recruited over the last four transfer windows to 31.\n\nIt also means Aberdeen are now relying on players to make the difference who - regardless of their quality - have played very few minutes this season amid form and injury issues in the first half of the season.\n\nThe scrutiny on recruitment will increase to an even greater degree should they lose on Wednesday, too.\n\nHorneland 'intensity' perfect for Aberdeen - Stavrum\n\nThe counter argument is that change has to start somewhere.\n\nPfannenstiel only arrived in November and, if he believes Horneland is the man to transform Aberdeen, patience may well be a virtue.\n\nThe signings of midfielder Afeez Aremu and Dennis Geiger, both midfielders with Bundesliga experience and a better physical profile, are a nod to Aberdeen's ambition to rebuild again.\n\nThere has been an acknowledgement that more Scottish players are needed in their ranks to forge a stronger identity, with more energy and intensity.\n\nThat matches what Horneland achieved at Brann. This is work that will continue in the background regardless of the outcome against Motherwell.\n\nAnd though being dragged into a relegation scrap cannot be discounted given they have lost seven of their last nine league games, they have an eight-point buffer on 11th-place Kilmarnock with two games in hand.\n\nNonetheless if Motherwell were to inflict a fourth defeat on Aberdeen this season and end their grip on the Scottish Cup, you can count on empty seats and the bleak smell of apathy at Pittodrie until May.\n\n\"There is a lot of work needing done at Aberdeen,\" Stewart added.\n\n\"They've got Peter Leven and Tony Docherty in until the end of the season which brings a little bit of clarity.\n\n\"But there is clearly a lot of upheaval and change that is going to happen by the time the season finishes.\"\n\nVisit our Aberdeen page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\n\nGet Aberdeen news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

    "fullText": "Around £45m raised by the £520m investment into The Hundred will be used to fund projects that make cricket more inclusive, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has announced.\n\nWhen the eight Hundred teams were sold last year, 10% of the total money raised was ring-fenced for the grassroots game in England and Wales.\n\nThe ECB has confirmed the creation of the strategic facilities fund, which will be used for larger-scale projects and is expected to provide investment for at least 10 years.\n\nIt will target plans which benefit women and girls cricket, disability cricket, those in lower socio-economic groups or ethnically diverse communities.\n\n\"This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for grassroots cricket thanks to the investment we've received into The Hundred,\" ECB chief executive officer Richard Gould said.\n\n\"With more children playing, the rapid growth of women's and girls' cricket, and our desire to become the most inclusive team sport, new and improved facilities are vital to open up access to cricket for communities across England and Wales.\"\n\nThe ECB hopes to receive additional money from the UK Government and other partners to boost funding.\n\nThe government announced £1.5m of funding last year for the building of two new cricket domes, though it has not fulfilled the previous government's pledge to put £35m into grassroots cricket.\n\nThe ECB is also doubling the money available in smaller grants for new and upgraded facilities at individual clubs and increasing the amount available in interest-free loans to fund improvements.\n\nA further £6m from the recreational game's share of the Hundred investment will be used over the next three years to support the recreational county boards in delivering their own strategic plans.\n\nBids for money from the new facilities fund will be done from county boards. Applications will open in April.\n\nIn 2023, the Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket (ICEC) report found \"structural and institutional racism\" continues to exist in cricket, women are treated as \"subordinate\" to men at all levels of the sport and said there is a prevalence of \"elitism and class-based discrimination\".\n\nIn response, the ECB invested an initial £2m to improve diversity in 2023 and last year an independent report said the sport is “moving in the right direction”.\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "On Tuesday night, 17-year-old Ami Nakai - the youngest competitor in the women's event - stormed to the top after the short program.",
    "fullText": "With the International Skating Union raising the minimum age for figure skating competitors from 15 to 17, it seemed like the era of Olympic child champions might be over.\n\nAmi Nakai had other ideas. On Tuesday night, the 17-year-old - the youngest competitor in the women's event - stormed to the top after the short program.\n\nIt throws a firecracker into what was already one of the most fascinating competitions at Milan-Cortina 2026 and sets the free skate - where the medals will be decided - up as must-see.\n\nBecause of her age, Nakai is a debutant on the world tour this year. While she is highly rated in figure skating circles, she did not have the public profile of the other medal contenders.\n\nIt also meant she had a lower world ranking, thus starting 18th of the 29 competitors - much earlier than the highest-profile skaters. But like Guillaume Cizeron and Laurence Fournier Baudry in the ice dance, Nakai came from the middle of the pack to be a frontrunner.\n\nBut Nakai, with a season-best of 78.00 going into these Games, always had a chance of medalling if she performed to her best.\n\nAnd she did, with a terrific performance full of fun, energy and quality. Nakai smiled broadly and punched the air at the end.\n\nIt continues Japan's strong performance in the figure skating, where they have collected four medals - with at least one in every event they have entered.\n\nAfter being narrowly pipped to team gold by USA, they have since had the upper hand.\n\nThe shock failure of men's favourite Ilia Malinin to win a medal saw Yuma Kagiyama and Shun Sato claim silver and bronze. Then in the pairs, Riku Miura and Ryuichi Kihara recovered from a botched lift in their short program to claim gold thanks to a flawless free skate, rising from fifth to first.\n\nThe women's event could be Japan's crowning achievement - a podium sweep is possible.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nNakai's closest competitor for gold is Kaori Sakamoto, eight years her senior and viewed as Japan's leading contender going into the event.\n\nThis is Sakamoto's final season in figure skating. Aged 25, she is stepping away from the sport after Thursday.\n\nSakamoto has dominated since 2022, winning three world titles in a row, a joint record for a Japanese figure skater and the first woman to do that since the 1960s.\n\nHer choice of music for the short program - Time to Say Goodbye, by opening ceremony star Andrea Bocelli - was poignant and worked to get the crowd on side.\n\nShe got positive grades of execution for all seven elements, including the triple flip and toe loop which had the highest base value, and nearly skipped off the ice in delight. If Nakai is anything less than perfect on Thursday, Sakamoto can pounce.\n\nCompleting the Japanese trio is Mone Chiba, who won bronze at last year's World Championships. She is currently fourth, two and a half points outside the medals.\n\nWhile it was a stellar night for Japan, for the USA's 'Blade Angels' it was a mixed bag.\n\nSakamoto lost her world title last year to Alysa Liu, who currently sits third and is best placed to ruin the Japanese party.\n\nThe 20-year-old is one of the most recognisable and popular athletes at these Games - a proud 'alt girl' with her halo hair and lip piercing.\n\nWith a huge American contingent at Milano Ice Skating Arena on Tuesday, Liu got huge acclamation from compatriot Malinin and celebrities in the crowd ranging from actress Halle Bailey to rap icon Snoop Dogg.\n\nHowever, she lost points on her triple lutz for landing on the quarter - not fully completing the rotation and returning to the ice 90 degrees short.\n\nLiu went first of the three American athletes in the final group, and her slight underperformance set the tone.\n\nIsabeau Levito, who at 18 is the youngest member of USA squad, produced a classic routine but it did not have the technical complexity of Nakai's performance.\n\nLevito sits eighth and needs an unlikely series of events to break the top three.\n\nThe biggest disappointment was Amber Glenn, the reigning American national champion.\n\nAt 26, Glenn is the oldest American female figure skater in nearly a century to make her Olympic debut.\n\nBut after a strong start, Glenn missed her triple loop - it registered as an invalid element, thus scoring zero points and pushing her down to 13th.\n\nShe knows that will likely cost her a medal, and sobbed as she exited the rink.\n\nGlenn, out as bisexual and a critic of US President Donald Trump, has faced an online backlash against her political and LGBTQ+ comments.\n\nOn Tuesday, Glenn, who has battled depression, posted to Instagram: \"The world has ended for me many times, and yet tomorrow still comes. Keep going.\"\n\nIf she produces her best in the free skate, she could shake up the medal race.\n\nThen there is Individual Neutral Athlete (AIN) Adeliia Petrosian.\n\nSo far, none of the AIN representatives - from countries banned from the 2026 Olympics - have won a medal.\n\nThe most likely candidate is 18-year-old Petrosian, the Russian national champion.\n\nShe is under the tutelage of controversial Eteri Tutberidze, who is not officially listed as a coach - but the teenager is accompanied by Daniil Gleikhengauz, with whom Tutberidze has worked closely.\n\nPetrosian, who has not been able to compete internationally because of the ISU ban on Russian athletes, set a season-best short program score of 72.89 putting her in fifth going into the free skate. She led the leaderboard for nearly three hours until Nakai stepped up.\n\nIt sets up a grandstand finish to figure skating at Milan-Cortina 2026. Don't miss it.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

Vinicius seemed to be left ostracised and the match restarted 10 minutes later.\n\nThe French official will file his report to Uefa, which will now complete its own investigation into the events in Lisbon.\n\nBut could it be handled any better?\n\n\"It is the least bad of a set of terrible options,\" Kick It Out chair Sanjay Bhandari told BBC Sport.\n\n\"I don't think anyone feels really happy with it, and I think everyone feels dissatisfied with it.\n\n\"But I don't think anyone's been able to come up with an alternative that's better.\"\n\nVinicius: Eight years at Real Madrid, 20 cases of alleged racist abuse\n\nUefa introduced its three-step racism procedure in 2009 and gave referees the power to halt games.\n\nThis is how the protocol works; If a player reports alleged racism, a referee has no further powers if they have not heard what was said. The game is stopped and details given to the fourth official.\n\nOn Tuesday, Vinicius took himself off the pitch. It was then a case of diplomacy between the teams to get the game back on.\n\nHad there been racist abuse from supporters, as is more usually the case, an announcement would be made.\n\nIf the racism continues, by players or fans, the game could be suspended for a longer period and another warning issued over the public address system.\n\nIf it still goes on, the game could then be abandoned.\n\nBhandari said the three-step protocol has \"not been invoked a huge number of times\" but when it has, it has provided a \"quite healthy debate\".\n\nIt was used in the Premier League in the first match of this season at Liverpool by referee Anthony Taylor when Antoine Semenyo said he had been racially abused by a fan in the crowd during Bournemouth's game at Anfield.\n\nIn 2013, Uefa drew up its \"European football united against racism\", external policy.\n\nIt was driven by Gianni Infantino who, at the time, was the general secretary of the governing body.\n\nThe document created 11 resolutions which set out the responsibilities of players, coaches, clubs and supporters.\n\nInfantino successfully pushed for a suspension of \"at least 10 matches\" for players found guilty.\n\nIn 2021, Slavia Prague's Ondrej Kudela was banned for 10 matches after racially abusing Rangers midfielder Glen Kamara.\n\nThe crossing of arms to display an \"X\" is not part of the Uefa protocol.\n\nFifa introduced this in 2024 to makes all participants aware why a match had been halted.\n\nPrestianni denies he racially abused Vinicius\n\n'Defamation campaign' against Prestianni - Benfica\n\nA referee can only take action if they have heard the alleged racist abuse, in which case the player would be sent off.\n\nIf not, the only option available is the three-step protocol adopted across the game.\n\nFormer Fifa and Uefa assistant referee Darren Cann told BBC Sport the referee's role is to \"assure the offended player that the allegation is taken very seriously\".\n\n\"All referees are highly trained and very familiar with the three-step approach to follow, should they be made aware of any racist incidents,\" he said.\n\n\"Usually the player will continue but the referee cannot force him to if he doesn't want to.\n\n\"The player could be substituted. Abandoning the match is the last resort.\"\n\nBhandari said this \"prioritises getting the game played\", but he accepted officials have limited options.\n\nThe issue will always be that \"players are not stupid enough to say anything within earshot of the referee\".\n\nBut Bhandari added Kick It Out would back any team that decided to walk off the pitch in support of their team-mate.\n\n\"If we went to the theatre and someone racially abused an actor, we would not expect the actor to stay on stage,\" he added.\n\n\"It would take something like that for people to have another debate about the protocol.\n\n\"The way this dialogue always ends up is, what are the alternatives?\"\n\nChampions League scores & fixtures\n\nFollow the latest Champions League news\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone\n\nWatch highlights of every Champions League game from 22:00 on Wednesday on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nThere will also be a Champions League Match of the Day on BBC One on Wednesday, from 22:40 to 00:00.",

    "fullText": "Formula 1 bosses are moving towards a rule change that would close a loophole rivals believe Mercedes have exploited in the sport's new engine rules.\n\nAudi, Honda and Ferrari fear Mercedes have found a way to use thermal expansion and materials technology to exceed the mandated compression ratio.\n\nThe current rules state the maximum compression ratio of 16:1 is to be measured at ambient conditions but Mercedes are claimed to have found a way to exceed this when the engine is running at temperature.\n\nIt has now been proposed that the rule will be changed from 1 August to ensure the compression ratio is measured at a \"representative operating temperature of 130C\" as well as at ambient temperature.\n\nThis will now go to a vote of the power-unit manufacturers, along with the FIA and commercial rights holder F1, where it is expected to pass.\n\nThat would effectively give Mercedes the first 13 races of a 24-race season to exploit whatever advantage they may have achieved from their technology, if their engine is indeed exceeding the compression ratio at any point.\n\nMercedes team principal Toto Wolff insists their engine is legal and that its design has been approved by the FIA.\n\nThe compression ratio is a measurement of the cylinder displacement between the two extremes of the piston stroke. Rivals believe increasing this beyond 16:1 could give a gain of as much of 0.3 seconds per lap.\n\nWilliams team principal James Vowles, whose team use Mercedes engines, dismissed the debate as \"just noise that will probably go away, probably in the next 48 hours\".\n\nRed Bull's position on the compression ratio argument has not been clear until now, following their entry as a power-unit manufacturer this season.\n\nRed Bull team principal Laurent Mekies said on Wednesday: \"We don't think it's noise. We think we must have the clarity on what we can and cannot do.\"\n\nThe new engine proposal came on the same day as the F1 Commission discussed a variety of issues that have arisen from the first running of the cars under the new rules introduced this year.\n\nThese included the increased difficulty of the start process and the way energy deployment and recovery are controlled by the rules.\n\nRed Bull advantage 'pretty scary', says Russell\n\nRed Bull are 'the benchmark', says Wolff\n\nThe new power units introduced this year have a near 50-50 split between internal combustion engine and electrical parts of the engine and are energy starved as a result of the way the rules have been defined.\n\nThere is increasing concern within F1 about the degree of energy management the drivers are being forced to take on and the discussions centre on ways to make this less of a feature.\n\nA statement from the FIA said: \"Further evaluation and technical checks on energy-management matters will be carried out over the following three days at the second pre-season test in Bahrain.\n\n\"It was agreed that no immediate major regulatory changes were required, given that initial evidence and feedback remains immature and that premature change carried the risk of increased instability ahead of the first race. Further reviews will be carried out once more data becomes available.\"\n\nThe concern over the start process is centred on the increased amount of time it takes to get the turbos in the engines spooled up to the right speed for the optimum launch.\n\nThis is taking in the region of 10 seconds following the removal of the MGU-H, the part of the hybrid system that recovered energy from the turbo and could be used to eliminate lag. A new start process is expected to be introduced giving drivers extra time before the start-light process begins.",

    "fullText": "Benfica claim there is a \"defamation campaign\" against Gianluca Prestianni after Uefa launched an investigation into claims he racially abused Real Madrid winger Vinicius Jr.\n\nTuesday's Champions League tie at Benfica was halted for 10 minutes after Vinicius reported alleged racist abuse to referee Francois Letexier and he and his team-mates left the field.\n\nBrazil international Vinicius, who has been a victim of numerous incidents of racist abuse during his playing career, later said in a post on Instagram: \"Racists are, above all, cowards.\"\n\nPrestianni, who could face a minimum 10-match ban from European competition if found guilty, denied directing racial abuse at Vinicius.\n\nOn Wednesday, Benfica defended Prestianni via a post on their official X account, alongside a video of the alleged incident, saying: \"Given the distance, the Real Madrid players could not have heard what they claim to have heard.\"\n\nThe club added they \"fully support\" and believe the version of events presented by Prestianni.\n\n\"[Prestianni's] conduct in the service of the club has always been guided by respect for opponents, institutions and the principles that define Benfica's identity,\" Benfica added.\n\n\"The club regrets the defamation campaign of which the player has been a victim.\"\n\nWhat is Uefa's racism protocol and is it working?\n\nPrestianni denies he racially abused Vinicius\n\nVinicius' brilliant winner beats Benfica in game halted for alleged racism\n\nVinicius: Eight years at Real Madrid, 20 cases of alleged racist abuse\n\nBenfica manager Jose Mourinho said in his post-match interview that he had been told different things by Vinicius and Prestianni regarding the incident.\n\nMourinho, who managed Real for 178 games between 2010 and 2013, said Vinicius had been disrespectful in his goal celebration and pointed to their legendary striker Eusebio as proof that Benfica is not a racist club.\n\n\"The club reaffirms, clearly and unequivocally, its historical and unwavering commitment to defending the values of equality, respect and inclusion, which are in line with the core values of its foundation and have Eusebio as their greatest symbol,\" Benfica said.\n\nMourinho's and Benfica's comments have been criticised by a number of people, including anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out.\n\nKick It Out chair Sanjay Bhandari said both the club and manager had \"failed\".\n\n\"It's a natural inclination to want to believe your player, but the reality is they didn't hear it,\" Bhandari told BBC Sport.\n\n\"There's only two people who are in that conversation and two people who could have heard what was said.\n\n\"I think the better reaction from a club with Benfica's fantastic stature would be to say we're going to cooperate with the investigation.\n\n\"This is quite typical after these kinds of discriminatory events. The discrimination is one thing, the gaslighting is another.\"\n\nFifa president Gianni Infantino said he was \"shocked and saddened\" by the incident and commended Letexier for activating the anti-racism protocol.\n\n\"There is absolutely no room for racism in our sport and in society - we need all the relevant stakeholders to take action and hold those responsible to account,\" he added.\n\n\"I will always continue to reiterate: No to racism, no to any form of discrimination!\"\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Ukrainian officials will boycott next month's Winter Paralympics after Russian and Belarusian athletes were invited to compete under their national flags.\n\nOn Tuesday, it was announced six Russian and four Belarusian athletes will compete in alpine skiing, cross-country skiing and snowboarding at the Milan-Cortina Games, which start on 6 March.\n\nIn September, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) lifted its ban on athletes from the two countries competing at the Games.\n\nHowever, the IPC does not govern the six sports contested at the Paralympics and despite the individual bodies - including the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS) - refusing to lift their own bans, Russia and Belarus won an appeal to the Court of Arbitration of Sport (Cas) against FIS.\n\nAs a result, athletes have been able to return to FIS competitions and the 10 athletes have been awarded bipartite commission invitations to compete at the Paralympics.\n\n\"Ukrainian public officials will not attend the Paralympic Games,\" said the country's sports minister Matvii Bidnyi.\n\n\"We will not be present at the opening ceremony. We will not take part in any other official Paralympic events.\n\n\"We thank every official from the free world who will do the same. We will keep fighting!\"\n\nEuropean Commissioner for Sport Glenn Micallef said he would also not attend the opening ceremony and called on others to \"take the same stand\".\n\nBoth countries were suspended from Paralympic competition after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, with Belarus a close ally of Russia.\n\nA partial ban - allowing athletes to compete as neutrals - was introduced in 2023.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Johan Eliasch, the president of the FIS, told BBC Sport the decision to award bipartite places had \"not been easy\".\n\n\"What we're dealing with here is an issue that is divisive, where people have different feelings depending on where they come from. It's something that we have to respect,\" he said.\n\n\"Athletes can't choose where they were born. On the other hand, they can't be used for PR purposes in their home countries to promote the war.\n\n\"It's our duty to make sure that athletes are not weaponised for political purposes.\"\n\nSix athletes to compete under Russian flag at Paralympics\n\nBipartite commission invites are granted to individual athletes, rather than their international federation, and allow the participation of top athletes \"who may not have had the opportunity to qualify through other methods due to extraordinary circumstances\", among other factors.\n\nThe IPC, with the support of international federations - in this case FIS - decides who receives the bipartite slots after receiving recommendations from the federation.\n\nUkraine has also been awarded bipartite slots in three sports.\n\nIn an earlier statement, Bidnyi said the decision to award slots to Russia and Belarus was \"both disappointing and outrageous\", adding their flags \"have no place at international sporting events that stand for fairness, integrity and respect.\"\n\nEliasch added: \"It is difficult, and in our case in the end, the courts decided the outcome.\n\n\"Everything has been done by the book. We've had strict vetting schemes of the people who do participate to make sure they don't have any affiliation with the military, and it's important that we keep that up.\"\n\nUK culture secretary Lisa Nandy said the awarding of bipartite places to Russian and Belarusian athletes was \"completely the wrong decision\", while in a statement on Wednesday, the British Paralympic Association said it was the \"wrong approach\".\n\n\"ParalympicsGB has consistently supported the decision to suspend NPC Russia and NPC Belarus, however the IPC membership recently made the decision to reinstate them and we have to recognise that decision,\" it said.\n\n\"We have been clear throughout that we believe this is the wrong approach and the ban should have remained in place given the ongoing war in Ukraine. We continue to express our solidarity with the people of Ukraine and our friends at NPC Ukraine.\"\n\nResponding to Nandy, the IPC said: \"The International Paralympic Committee is a democratic organisation and the decision to lift the partial suspension of NPCs Belarus and Russia was taken by IPC member organisations at the 2025 General Assembly.\n\n\"At this meeting nearly 180 of the IPC's 211 members were in attendance and voted on this matter. We have to respect the decision of our members who come from all over the world.\"\n\nRussian news agency TASS reports that among the athletes set to compete are Aleksey Bugaev, a three-time Paralympic champion in alpine skiing, and cross-country skiers Ivan Golubkov and Anastasiia Bagiian - both are World Championship medallists.\n\nAll three returned to competition in January, and both Bugaev and Bagiian have since won World Cup titles.",

    "description": "American star Mikaela Shiffrin cements her status as the greatest alpine skier of all time as she wins Olympic slalom gold in emphatic fashion.",
    "fullText": "After claiming an emotional Olympic gold, Mikaela Shiffrin's thoughts turned to one person who was not there - her father, Jeff.\n\nThe American crossed the line as Olympic slalom champion, as she did 12 years ago in Sochi, aged 18.\n\nOnly this time, as she embraced her mother and coaches, she felt the absence of her dad, who passed away six years ago.\n\n\"For my dad, who didn't get to see this. This was a moment I had dreamed about. I have also been very scared of this moment,\" she said.\n\n\"Everything in life you do after you lose someone you love is like a new experience.\n\n\"It is like being born again and I still have so many moments where I resist this. I don't want to be in life without my dad and maybe today was the first time that I could actually accept this reality.\n\n\"Instead of thinking I would be in this moment without him, to take the moment to be silent with him.\"\n\nShiffrin spent almost a year away from the sport following the loss - which she referred to as an \"invisible injury\" - while she has spoken openly about her mental health struggles.\n\nHer triumph in Italy, claiming gold in emphatic style by an extraordinary 1.50sec margin, cements her name among the greats of alpine skiing.\n\nThe 30-year-old clocked an overall time of 1:39:10 to become a three-time Olympic champion, following her success in Sochi then Pyeongchang in 2018.\n\nThe eight years in between without an Olympic medal have brought many challenges for Shiffrin, within and away from the sport.\n\nBut she said the most important thing on Wednesday was to \"show up\" for the race.\n\n\"It's so much work just to show up for two runs and do something that is within me and I know how to do,\" she said.\n\n\"It is not always easy. Sometimes it feels impossible. In the end, today, it was to take away the noise and be simple with it.\"\n\nSeven-time world champion Shiffrin arrived in Cortina as the heavy favourite under significant pressure to deliver.\n\nThis season she has won seven of eight slalom World Cup races and finished second in the other to seal the overall title with races to spare.\n\nHer 108 World Cup race wins make her the world's most successful alpine skier, while she has featured on the podium a further 58 times and won the overall title five times.\n\nBut the unwanted tagline of 'being unable to perform on the big stage' has followed her since she failed to win a medal in Beijing four years ago.\n\nShiffrin crashed out of both the giant slalom and slalom events just seconds into the runs, completing six races but returning home without a medal.\n\nBehind the scenes, Shiffrin was still struggling to come to terms with the loss of her father and said she suffered with memory issues, which meant she would struggle to remember courses.\n\nThen, having overcome that to become \"stronger as a person\" and closing in on a 100th World Cup race win, she crashed in a giant slalom race in Killington in December 2024, sustaining a puncture wound and muscle damage to her stomach.\n\nAgain, Shiffrin's mental health suffered and she said she had visions of her crashing and a fear of doing it again.\n\nEven enjoying a remarkably successful season this year, questions remained around whether Shiffrin could return to the top of the Olympic podium after things did not initially go to plan for her in Cortina.\n\nShe finished 11th in the giant slalom and an agonising fourth in the team event alongside Olympic downhill champion Breezy Johnson.\n\nBut in her favoured event, where she has 71 World Cup race wins, the most by any alpine skier in any discipline, Shiffrin was able to block out the noise and \"just ski\".\n\n\"I wanted to be free, I wanted to unleash. It's not easy to do that, but I've been so focused every single day,\" she said.\n\nShiffrin did all the hard work in the first run, gliding down the piste in 47.13secs to give herself a significant cushion going into the second run.\n\nAgain, her thoughts went to her father.\n\n\"Before the second run, I was trying to take a nap and I sort of started to cry as I was thinking about my dad,\" she said.\n\n\"I was thinking about the fact that I actually can show up today and honestly say in the start gate that I have all of the tools necessary to do my best, and to earn that moment.\"\n\nShiffrin, already the most decorated alpine skier of all time, won gold with what was ultimately an exhibition run, completing the run in 51.97secs to beat Switzerland's Camille Rast and Sweden's Anna Swenn Larsson.\n\nIn an emotional news conference, she said: \"I think part of my journey through grief has been challenging because I don't feel this thing that a lot of people talk about - this deep spiritual connection with their loved one.\n\n\"People talk about feeling the presence and I have not felt it that way. I think about my dad all the time. I feel connected to him in my thoughts, and talking about him.\n\n\"Sometimes I have also been resentful of the people feeling this person and they're like, 'They are here with me and they're carrying me through this day'. And I am like, where? Why do you get to feel that? Why can't it be easier?\n\n\"Today, it was like maybe I just get to talk to him, and maybe he doesn't have to specifically answer. Which is hard, but it is OK.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "description": "Spanish football expert Guillem Balague details how Vincius Jr has become a global symbol of resistance against discrimination.",
    "fullText": "Spanish football expert Guillem Balague was at the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon on Tuesday as Real Madrid's Champions League play-off tie at Benfica was halted for 10 minutes after Vinicius Jr reported alleged racist abuse.\n\nIt marked the 20th time Vinicius alleges he has been the subject of abuse during his eight years at Real Madrid.\n\nHere, Balague gives his perspective and details how the 25-year-old forward has become a global symbol of resistance against discrimination.\n\nFootball should have been revelling in a masterpiece last night - Vinicius scoring a goal so outrageous it deserved to dominate every headline.\n\nInstead, once again, the sport was dragged into the same rancid swamp it never seems able to climb out of: alleged racism, denials, excuses and a staggering lack of understanding from those who should know better.\n\nVinicius has been here before many, many times. In fact, he has now faced 20 incidents of alleged abuse.\n\nThe latest accusation is that Benfica's Argentine midfielder Gianluca Prestianni racially abused him minutes after that wonder goal.\n\nPrestianni denies the allegation. Vinicius has been backed strongly by a number of his team-mates, in particular Kylian Mbappe who told the media he heard a racist term used five times.\n\nAfter the game, Benfica boss Jose Mourinho effectively blamed the player himself for provoking the situation.\n\n\"These talents are able to do these beautiful things, but unfortunately was not just happy to score that astonishing goal,\" he told Amazon Prime Video Sport. \"When you score a goal like that, you celebrate in a respectful way.\"\n\nHe then went on to claim that Benfica couldn't possibly be a racist football club for the simple reason that its greatest-ever player Eusebio was black.\n\nMourinho's comments mark a new low, but are nonetheless indicative of the media debate - particularly in Spain and today clearly in Portugal - that remains stuck in the same place.\n\n\"Yes, they insult him, but he should behave better,\" seems to be the constant refrain.\n\nAs if you could separate one thing from the other. As if they weren't part of the same process.\n\nWhen Vinicius confronts the stands his attitude is interpreted as arrogant and inappropriate.\n\nBut that reaction is said to stem from the same source as his protests against racism: a constant struggle against a hostile environment.\n\nFrantz Fanon said in his influential 1952 book Black Skin, White Masks: \"The Black man has to fight twice as hard to be accepted as a man.\"\n\nPerhaps for Vinicius this burden translates into anger, tension and gestures that, from the outside, seem excessive.\n\nBut seen from within, they could be viewed as pure survival.\n\nWhen the Spanish press demands that Vinicius limit himself to \"playing and keeping quiet,\" it points to what the American sociologist Eduardo Bonilla-Silva called \"racism without racists\" - cultural frameworks that don't directly insult, but blame the affected person for their reaction.\n\nVinicius has become a global symbol of resistance against discrimination as he strives to get the authorities to toughen their protocols and actions.\n\nWhat is Uefa's racism protocol and is it working?\n\nThe hostility towards Vinicius is real - and it has names, dates and court sentences.\n\nThe latest incident at the Estadio da Luz marks the 20th time he has allegedly been abused in his time with Real Madrid.\n\nHe has been insulted in stadiums across Spain. He has testified in court after a black mannequin wearing his shirt was hung from a bridge.\n\nHe has seen fans being sanctioned with suspended sentences for racist abuse in Valencia and Mallorca. This was largely thanks to La Liga's efforts to ensure those actions do not remain unpunished within a judicial culture that long treated football's \"industrial\" language and \"banter\" with indulgence.\n\nA chronology of some of the incidents suffered by him makes for depressing reading.\n\nBack in October 2021 during a Clasico at the Camp Nou, a fan shouted racist abuse at him as he was being substituted. The case was closed because the police were unable to identify the perpetrator.\n\nThen in March 2022, Mallorca fans made monkey noises towards him and told him that he should \"go pick bananas\".\n\nThe authorities were \"outraged\" and said it was \"despicable\" but not \"criminally significant\". No action was taken.\n\nOn the Spanish football programme El Chiringuito, Pedro Bravo, the head of the Spanish Football Agents' Association, suggested Vinicius should \"stop acting like a monkey\" and respect his opponents.\n\nHe later apologized on X, claiming he had \"badly used the expression... in a metaphorical way to mean 'fooling around'\".\n\nThe comment caused outrage, especially in Brazil. No further action was taken.\n\nIn September 2022, Atletico Madrid fans chanted racist abuse outside the stadium. Prosecutors did not file charges.\n\nA doll wearing Vinicius' jersey was found hanging from a bridge in January 2023. Four members of the supporters' group Frente Atletico were sentenced to prison terms of between 14 and 22 months, which were later commuted to fines and restraining orders.\n\nFurther incidents followed over the next few months, all of which led to little or no repercussions for the perpetrators.\n\nIf there was a turning point it occurred in Valencia at the Mestalla in May 2023, when Vinicius confronted the stands after being insulted.\n\nLater, in extra time, he was sent off after an argument with Valencia goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili and for punching Hugo Duro in the face.\n\nIn June 2024, three fans were sentenced to eight months in prison and two years of stadium bans for their part in the abuse. It was the first sentence of its kind in Spain.\n\nWhen he returned to Mestalla in March 2024 he was met by a chorus of boos. His response? Two goals, celebrated with a raised fist.\n\nSometimes he doesn't even have to be at the match to suffer the racial taunts.\n\nEleven days after the Mestalla return, racist abuse towards him was chanted before a Champions League match between Atletico Madrid and Inter. Real Madrid reported the incident to the hate crimes prosecutor's office.\n\nThen five days later, at Osasuna's ground shouts of \"Vinicius die\" were heard.\n\nOn 29 September 2024, four people were arrested for inciting a hate campaign on social media under anonymity to insult the player during the derby against Atletico Madrid.\n\nMost recently, this February, during the Copa del Rey semi-final against Real Sociedad, referee Jose Maria Sanchez Martinez paused the match through Spain's anti-hate protocol.\n\nThis was due to chants against another player, but the cameras also captured a fan making monkey gestures towards Vinicius during the stoppage. The club broadcast announcements over the PA system and LED screens rejecting xenophobic chants.\n\nOnly last month, during Alvaro Arbeloa's debut as Real manager against Albacete in the Copa del Rey, a group of their fans hurled racist insults at the Brazilian.\n\nLa Liga strongly condemned the incident, reaffirming its support for the player.\n\nPerhaps you might wonder why Vinicius continues to react and fight? He gave an answer in June 2024 after the racists who abused him in Valencia were sentenced to jail term.\n\n\"Many people asked me to ignore it, others said that my fight was in vain and that I should just 'play football',\" Vinicius said in a post on X.\n\n\"But, as I've always said, I'm not a victim of racism. I am an executioner of racists. This first criminal conviction in Spanish history is not for me. It's for all black people.\"",

    "fullText": "Lewis Hamilton says he finds this year's Formula 1 cars \"more fun\" to drive - in contrast to Max Verstappen and Fernando Alonso's assessment of the impact of the new rules.\n\nF1 has made the biggest rule change in its history and introduced new regulations for chassis, engines, tyres and fuel.\n\nVerstappen has criticised the amount of energy management required from the new hybrid engines, but Hamilton said he was enjoying the reduced grip of the cars and different aerodynamic philosophy.\n\n\"We just have a less downforce,\" the Ferrari driver said. \"But you still have to discover the grip. There's still so many elements completely under our control.\n\n\"So, it's just different, and new, and I still find it quite fun.\n\n\"The cars are more fun to drive. They're easier to correct. So you have snaps and keep them on track. The previous year's cars were a bit too on edge.\"\n\n'Just not F1' or 'a lot of fun'? New cars split drivers\n\nHiding pace? Too slow? What pre-season testing told us\n\nBut Alonso said that a driver's skill was not as important as before, because optimum energy management meant some corners were taken slower than they could be because doing so gained more lap time from having extra energy to deploy on straights than was lost through the bends.\n\nAlonso said: \"You're always on the limit on the grip. It depends on the corners. You're always on the limit on the grip in a rental car if you push to the limit.\n\n\"But the high-speed corners, especially, I think it's less challenging. You have to say that. There's nothing wrong to say [that].\n\n\"In Turn 12 in Bahrain, and some of the corners maybe in Barcelona, you decide to save energy and go through the corner at a slower speed so you have more energy for the straight.\n\n\"From a driver's point of view the skills matter less because you can go as fast as the energy choice you make before that corner, so it's a different Formula 1.\"\n\nFollowing Verstappen's criticism of the new engines last week, in which he said the new cars were like \"Formula E on steroids\" and \"just not Formula 1\", he said: \"You're fighting the grip. You're on the limit of what you have, for sure. It's just not as much now.\n\n\"Of course, I also know that this probably is one of the worst [circuits], in terms of the grip feeling that you get from a car, because of the tarmac being so aggressive.\n\n\"A lot less downforce but at the same time, you also don't get a lot of combined grip [in the braking and turning phase] at the moment. It's a bit hard to manage.\"\n\nHamilton said he did not yet have a clear picture on how the new rules would affect racing, and said: \"I don't know if it's going to be better.\"\n\nListen to Back at Base on BBC Sounds\n\nOn the first day of the final three-day pre-season test, Mercedes driver George Russell ended up fastest by 0.01 seconds from McLaren's Oscar Piastri.\n\nHeadline times in pre-season testing are notoriously unreliable indicators of actual competitive form, but the word in the paddock at this stage is that Mercedes are still leading the way in the lead-up to the season, with Red Bull, McLaren and Ferrari in close company.\n\nHowever, there is still time for that picture to change over the final two days of the test.\n\nThe troubled Aston Martin team improved after their dire first test last week, with Lance Stroll ending the day 2.5secs off the pace.\n\nHowever, both the car and engine are recognised as being off the pace. But their lead driver Fernando Alonso admitted the team faced a difficult time in the first part of the season.\n\n\"Everything can be fixed, for sure,\" he said, \"short and medium term. I don't think there is anything that is impossible to fix.\n\n\"We will try to fix everything that we can before Australia and after that we try to fix as many things as possible in the first couple of races. Because it's too late in the championship. But I'm optimistic. I think there is a solution in place.\"\n\nThe season starts with the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne on 6-8 March.\n\nFirst day, final pre-season test, Bahrain\n\n1 George Russell (GB) Mercedes one minute 33.459 seconds\n\n2 Oscar Piastri (Aus) McLaren +0.010\n\n3 Charles Leclerc (Mon) Ferrari +0.280\n\n4 Lando Norris (GB) McLaren +0.593\n\n5 Kimi Antonelli (Ita) Mercedes +0.699\n\n6 Isack Hadjar (Fra) Red Bull +0.801\n\n7 Lewis Hamilton (GB) Ferrari +0.840\n\n8 Carlos Sainz (Spa) Williams +1.654\n\n9 Franco Colapinto (Arg) Alpine +1.795\n\n10 Gabriel Bortoleto (Brz) Audi +1.804\n\n11 Alex Albon (Tha) Williams +2.231\n\n12 Liam Lawson (NZ) Racing Bulls +2.294\n\n13 Pierre Gasly (Fra) Alpine +2.439\n\n14 Lance Stroll (Can) Aston Martin +2.515\n\n15 Esteban Ocon (Fra) Alpine +2.959\n\n16 Fernando Alonso (Spa) Aston Martin +3.077\n\n17 Nico Hülkenberg (Ger) Audi +3.282\n\n18 Arvid Lindblad (GB) Racing Bulls +3.310\n\n19 Oliver Bearman (GB) Haas +3.311\n\n20 Valtteri Bottas (Fin) Cadillac +3.787\n\n21 Sergio Pérez (Mex) Cadillac +4.732\n\n*Red Bull's Max Verstappen in the car all day on Thursday",

    "fullText": "Newcastle United make the long trip to Qarabag for the first leg of their Champions League play-off round tie.\n\nThe 2,529-mile journey to face the Azerbaijani side is the longest distance ever travelled by an English club in the competition. The 2025-26 campaign is Newcastle’s fourth in the Champions League, though, incredibly, tonight’s tie is their first-ever knockout stage clash.\n\nDespite some memorable European ventures, the Magpies have never advanced to the latter rounds of the Champions League.\n\nAfter a runners-up finish in the Premier League the previous season, Newcastle qualified for the Champions League for the first time in 1997-98. At that stage, just a 24-team tournament, Kenny Dalglish’s side were handed a tough group, featuring Dynamo Kyiv, PSV Eindhoven, and Barcelona.\n\nFaustino Asprilla’s historic hat-trick downed Barcelona at St James’ Park in their opening fixture, but Newcastle failed to win again until matchday six. Home and away losses to PSV proved costly, as the Magpies finished third. Only the group winners were guaranteed to advance, with Dynamo Kyiv progressing to the quarter-finals.\n\nWhen Newcastle next qualified for the Champions League, a short-lived second group stage had been introduced to the format. Bobby Robson’s men progressed past the first group stage in historic fashion, as the first team to go through after losing their first three games. Craig Bellamy’s last-gasp goal at Feyenoord sealed their place in the next stage.\n\nIn the second group stage, Newcastle were handed a ‘Group of Death. Robson’s side were paired with Barcelona, Inter Milan, and Bayer Leverkusen, who had ended the previous season as Champions League runners-up. Newcastle beat Leverkusen in both fixtures, but ended third in the group to go out.\n\nA Champions League campaign that ended before it had started. Newcastle suffered a shock loss to Partizan Belgrade in qualifying, despite winning 1-0 in Serbia in the first leg. In the return, the Magpies lost 1-0 with Partizan progressing on penalties. Alan Shearer, Kieron Dyer, and Aaron Hughes all missed from the spot.\n\nNewcastle might be one of the most relieved sides at the new league phase format, given their bad luck with draws. Another Group of Death awaited Newcastle on their Champions League return in 2023-24, following a two-decade absence.\n\nParis Saint-Germain, Borussia Dortmund, and AC Milan were the opponents, with Eddie Howe’s side missing out on progress. A famous 4-1 win over PSG added another night to remember in this competition, but it was the club’s sole win in six games.\n\nRead – Elanga backs Howe to turn Newcastle’s season around\n\nSee more – 90s Hitmen: The Divine Ponytail, Roberto Baggio\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "fullText": "Michael Carrick would receive ‘a lot of support’ from the Manchester United squad if considered for the permanent manager’s position.\n\nCarrick has impressed since taking interim charge at Old Trafford, following Ruben Amorim’s dismissal last month. The 44-year-old is unbeaten in five Premier League games, winning four, and has lifted the Red Devils into the Champions League places.\n\nUnited are conducting their search for a permanent manager, with multiple options under consideration for the summer.\n\nAmong those believes to be in the frame are Oliver Glasner, who will leave Crystal Palace at the end of the campaign, Gareth Southgate and Julian Nagelsmann. The latter could leave Germany after the 2026 World Cup. However, Thomas Tuchel, who had been linked, has signed a new contract with England.\n\nDespite Carrick’s inexperience, his impact so far has won admirers in the dressing room. Discussing his chances of landing the permanent job, Manchester Evening News writer Tyrone Marshall said there is strong support for Carrick within the squad.\n\n“Both publicly and privately, they [players] are speaking warmly of Carrick. He has put a smile back on the faces of a lot of those players and Bruno Fernandes has been very vocal in his support of the 44-year-old.\n\n“United insist they are planning a “thorough” recruitment process to get the right person in charge of the 2026/27 season, and Carrick has certainly put himself in the frame for that, but I wouldn’t expect any decision until much later in the season, and possibly beyond the end of the season.\n\n“But if the players are asked, then I think Carrick will get a lot of support, especially if results continue as they are. They have enjoyed his coaching sessions, the style of football and the subtle changes he has made behind the scenes.”\n\nRead – Newcastle head to Qarabag for first-ever UCL knockout tie\n\nSee more – 90s Hitmen: The Divine Ponytail, Roberto Baggio\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "fullText": "Former Juventus star Beniamino Vignola does not believe the club’s defence is strong enough to overturn their first-leg loss to Galatasaray in the Champions League next week. The Turkish side defeated the Bianconeri 5-2, leaving Juventus needing three unanswered goals to force extra time in the return fixture.\n\nAt one stage in the match, Juventus held a 2-1 lead and appeared on course to secure an advantage from the first leg. However, Galatasaray capitalised on Juventus’ defensive frailties. A red card for Juan Cabal further weakened the Italian side, and the visitors ultimately secured a comprehensive 5-2 victory.\n\nThe result came as a significant shock, and the men at the Allianz Stadium now face a daunting challenge if they are to progress to the next round. Many supporters and analysts believe there is no route back into the tie. However, only the first leg has been played, and football has repeatedly shown that dramatic turnarounds are possible.\n\nJuventus will attempt to mount a response when they host Galatasaray in Turin. Overturning a three-goal deficit will require discipline, intensity, and defensive stability. Yet Vignola, who previously won the European Cup with the Old Lady, has expressed serious reservations about the current back line.\n\nLloyd Kelly (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\nSpeaking via Tuttojuve, Vignola was candid in his evaluation of the team’s defensive shortcomings. He said:\n\n“The defence today offers no certainty. And we’re giving the opponent too much space. The only ray of sunshine, albeit briefly, was Koopmeiners, who scored two important goals, one of which was truly beautiful. Unfortunately, it happened in a terrible match, but I hope this can give him that extra something he was looking for to finally break free.”\n\nHis comments reflect wider concerns about Juventus’ ability to manage high-pressure situations. While there were brief positives, particularly in attack, the defensive vulnerabilities proved decisive. Juventus must now produce a significantly improved performance if they are to keep their Champions League hopes alive and defy the odds in the second leg.",

    "description": "The history of AS Roma, its strong following, and its eagerness to play at the top level, both nationally and at the European level, preconditions the formation of the image of the football club, whic...",
    "fullText": "The history of AS Roma, its strong following, and its eagerness to play at the top level, both nationally and at the European level, preconditions the formation of the image of the football club, which is admittedly one of the most prestigious in Italy. In the contemporary game, in which control of finances and economic sustainability has become as vital as on-field strategies, Roma’s financial health is also a decisive factor in the development of its sporting goals.\n\nThat said, the interactions between the prudent accounting, the strategic investment and the competitive results are the key to the realization of why and how Roma is placed in Serie A and further. With fans tracking each turn of the season and weighing the chances on sites such as wetttippsheute that capture expectations and overall sentiment, the club’s financial position can be used to justify what can and cannot happen and to identify the limits.\n\nThe competitive strength of a club in the transfer market is dependent on the sources of revenue. For Roma, broadcast revenues continue to constitute a major source of revenue, yet international business is gaining significance. Promoting the club brand with international partners increases visibility and generates funds that can be reinvested in squad improvements.\n\nThese financial flows enable Roma to make more manoeuvres in the transfer market. Investing in high-potential young talent and retaining core performers constitutes a strategic approach to balancing short-term competitiveness and long-term growth. Nevertheless, such an approach should be supported by strict compliance with regulatory standards to prevent fines that may hinder sporting performance.\n\nThe Financial Fair Play (FFP) and other UEFA regulatory strategies ensure the financial fairness of clubs by maintaining a reasonable balance between spending and revenue, thereby preventing excessive use of funds. Adherence to these regulations would ensure that Roma is permitted to participate in European competitions and is not sanctioned, thereby discouraging Roma’s sporting goals.\n\nIn the case of Roma, it is very important to carefully plan finances as a way to navigate regulatory requirements. Any transfer, contract renewal, and any marketing initiative should not only be assessed on its sporting basis but also on its accounting basis. FFP compliance is no longer a procedural requirement; it is a strategic requirement that permeates the decision-making across every tier of the club.\n\nOne of the biggest expenses incurred by any football club is the wages of players. This must be managed effectively to achieve financial balance. The Roma wage system has been repeatedly revisited to align wages with performance and long-term sustainability.\n\nThis strategy has altered the squad’s strategy. Instead of pursuing a few high-profile contracts that may disrupt the wage ladder, Roma has sought prudence. This implies promoting performance, incorporating performance-based bonuses, and maintaining a wage structure that does not make the financial burden disproportionate.\n\nMoreover, this discipline is effective in that it sometimes hinders the acquisition of marquee names and at other times it has averted the financial pitfalls of the kind of fiscal vulnerability that has plagued clubs that have overspent. This restraint, in the case of Roma, can protect the club’s future while allowing competitive additions without compromising its tactical and cultural values.\n\nThe financial strategy of Roma is manifested in the transfer market strategy. The club focuses on players who are not only compatible with a specific tactical system but also provide more than merely on-field value. This philosophy includes younger talent with resale value, those in their prime whose wage demands are balanced, and those with strategic loan agreements.\n\nRather than engaging in bidding wars and inflating costs to an unsustainable level, Roma’s leadership tends to adopt a more calculated approach to its acquisition plans, minimizing financial risk and improving team quality. This cautious market participation can help Roma remain competitive in Serie A and European competitions without compromising its financial position.\n\nThe long-term objective of AS Roma is to play at the peak of Italian and European football. Such a dream, though, needs to be anchored in the financial reality. The club’s strategy on competition is based on the understanding that the financial health and success in the sport do not oppose one another but are mutually dependent on long-term success.\n\nThe financial well-being of AS Roma is not merely an accounting footnote but a key factor in how the club develops its competitive positioning. The strength of the financial base determines the capacity to compete in the transfer market, remain in regulatory compliance, and invest intelligently both in players and infrastructure.\n\nIn a game where financial misjudgment can result in on-screen losses, Roma’s focus on financial control and strategic development is a match between sporting aspiration and business feasibility. This strategy can be used to keep the club competitive enough to compete for honours and maintain its financial stability in the future.",

    "fullText": "Tiger Woods was always likely to get questions about Anthony Kim before the Genesis Invitational, especially after Kim’s win at LIV Golf Adelaide just days earlier.\n\nKim picked up his first professional win in nearly 16 years in Australia, coming back from five shots down to give LIV Golf what’s arguably its biggest moment yet.\n\nKim didn’t play a competitive round for over a decade before signing with LIV in 2024, and his return has sparked debate over where it stands among the sport’s greatest comebacks. Tiger Woods’ 2019 Masters win is still the benchmark for many.\n\nWoods put his body through plenty before lifting that trophy again at Augusta National. Few people can relate to Kim’s journey quite like him.\n\nAt one point, Kim appeared to have the potential to follow in Woods’ footsteps on the PGA Tour. And it looks like Woods believed he could reach those heights, as shown by his comments on what Kim has now accomplished.\n\n“Yeah, this kid hit it so good. He was on an unbelievable run when he won at Charlotte, and we played against each other at Congressional. He played unbelievable at the 2008 Ryder Cup. He had so much natural talent. He could hit any shot he wanted,” said Woods.\n\n“Then to see him struggle in life and didn’t really want to play golf, didn’t really want to be part of golf, and for him to come all the way back and for him to win and to be as devoted as he is to his family, it’s a story in which you just have to wrap your heart around it because of the struggles.\n\n“We can all relate to struggles. We all struggle in life. The longer it goes, the more tough times you’ve had. But for him to fight through it and for Anthony to get where he’s gotten to from the low that he was in is something that, as I said, you have to just wrap your heart around.”\n\nKim had been relegated from a league already facing questions about its overall depth, making his turnaround even more surprising.\n\nHis form had shown some improvement toward the end of 2025, but few could have expected him to chase down Jon Rahm and Bryson DeChambeau at The Grange.\n\nThis kind of comeback could serve as motivation for Woods, who hasn’t played in a PGA Tour event since 2024 and faces growing uncertainty around his return.\n\nOver the past year and a half, it’s been hard not to question whether we’ve seen the last of him at the top level, given all he’s had to deal with physically.\n\nBut Kim’s win is just another example of how sport has a way of delivering the most unexpected stories. Maybe there’s still one left in Tiger yet.\n\nWhy Johnson Wagner is ‘shocked’ by how Cameron Young has started this PGA Tour season\n\nWhy Tommy Fleetwood is wearing Jason Day’s Malbon apparel at the Genesis Invitational\n\nThe reason Tiger Woods once gave for why he has never won at Riviera Country Club",

They are technically spectacular,” Diaz said in an interview with Sky Germany before describing Kane as someone who “does everything really well”.\n\n“He surprised me a lot. I had seen him play in England, because we faced Tottenham several times. But it’s one thing to watch him on the opposing team. It’s another to actually share the locker room with him and stand with him every day on the training pitch and see how he works for us as a team, how he moves, how he constantly drops back, demands the ball, and of course, how he scores goals. He’s a machine. He really does everything well. I’m very proud to be part of this attack,” he added.\n\nHighlighting Olise's qualities, Diaz said:\n\n“Michael destroys you one-on-one; he’s so technically gifted and makes the difference. He’s a calm guy. On the pitch, he’s very communicative. He helps a lot, pays attention to many details, and sometimes says, ‘Hey, let’s defend like this or that.’ These are the details that help you grow as a footballer and make you feel comfortable. Again: it’s incredible to play with players like this.”",

    "fullText": "The Minnesota Vikings may or may not be in the market for a young off-ball linebacker, and ESPN knows just the guy: Nakobe Dean of the Philadelphia Eagles, who is set to test free agency in three weeks.\n\nIf the Vikings don’t keep their current veteran mix intact, Dean profiles as a clean Flores-style target with speed, range, and upside.\n\nMatt Bowen sketched out the best landing spots for the NFL’s Top 50 free agents, and for Dean, that’s evidently the Vikings.\n\nIf Minnesota doesn’t re-up with Eric Wilson or Ivan Pace Jr., a new inside linebacker is mandatory.\n\nESPN: Dean to Vikings Is the Way\n\nIn Bowen’s article about the league’s Top 50 free agents, the Vikings were mentioned just once: the top destination for Dean.\n\nBowen explained, “Best team fit: Minnesota Vikings. The Vikings have cap issues heading into free agency, but I really like the fit for Dean in coordinator Brian Flores’ defense. Dean, who had four sacks with the Eagles in 2025, is the league’s best blitzing linebacker, and he would join a system that led the NFL in blitz rate at 46.8%.”\n\nDean’s next contract is expected to fetch about $8 million per season, so Vikings interim general manager Rob Brzezinski, in theory, could net him for three years and $24 million or something similar.\n\nPenn Live‘s Johnny McGonigal on Dean’s free agency: “Dean, despite saying he wants to stay, is not expected to return. The Eagles signaled that would be the case when they drafted first-rounder Jihaad Campbell in 2025. We’ll see how the Eagles decide to dole out its cap space — and if they lose starters to any NFC counterparts.”\n\nThe Eagles drafted Dean in Round 3 of the 2022 NFL Draft after a bit of a tumble. Most believed Dean would fly off the board in Round 1 or 2. No such luck. Since then, the 5’11” 230-pounder has seen action in 47 games, starting 27, and delivering 226 total tackles, 19 tackles for loss, 13 QB hits, 7.5 sacks, 3 forced fumbles, and an interception. The peak of his powers to date occurred in 2024, when he recorded 128 total tackles and 3 sacks across 15 games.\n\nHere’s Dean’s Pro Football Focus resume through four seasons:\n\n2025: 62.2\n2024: 77.4\n2023: 61.7\n2022: 78.6\n\nDean’s top attributes are rushing the quarterback and stopping the run; he struggles a bit in pass coverage compared to his peers.\n\nNBC Sports‘ Reuben Frank weighed in on Dean’s free agency Monday, “And the flip side of that is it’s hard to imagine any way Dean is back in 2026. Even if you could sign him — and his outstanding play certainly raised his value significantly — why would he want to come back to a team where Baun and Campbell are going to be the starters?”\n\n“It’s going to be so hard to see Dean go because he’s been such a warrior for this team, and I don’t know if there’s anybody in that locker room who appreciates being an Eagle more than Nakobe. But it doesn’t make sense to pay what Dean is going to command on the open market when you already have two starting linebackers.”\n\nThe guy really sounds like a goner in Philly terms.\n\nVikings Have LB Options but No Youth\n\nThere’s a very clear path for the Vikings to feel all set at off-ball linebacker in 2026: simply re-sign Eric Wilson, who played like a fringe Pro Bowler during the entire 2025 campaign. Wilson and fellow defender Blake Cashman can cook in the middle of Minnesota’s defense. No problems there.\n\nStill, both men will be over 30 when the season begins. Most NFL teams prefer a bit of speed and youth at linebacker. The Vikings have neither, though Cashman and Wilson played phenomenally in 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, undrafted once-sensation Ivan Pace Jr.’s future is up in the air. The Vikings could let him walk as a restricted free agent, especially after benching Pace Jr. for Wilson last season. Minnesota’s one young linebacker (Pace Jr.) appears to be on the way out.\n\nTherefore, from the draft or free agency, Brian Flores needs a young linebacker — someone like Dean, who is 25.\n\nIf the Vikings want a non-Dean linebacker but also an option not over the age of 30, the free-agent list would look like this in March:\n\nThat’s plenty of options; it all depends on whether Minnesota wants youth at ILB or doesn’t mind older defenders like Cashman and Wilson.\n\nNFL free agency gets cracking in 19 days with “legal tampering.”",

With Wolves on Wednesday and midfield injuries, there's a chance we could see Saka continue in his role, with Arteta hinting the England international could feature there more this season.\n\n\"That's something that's a possibility and I wanted to try it, and we might use it in the future,\" Arteta said.\n\n\"There are still so many games, competitions and different scenarios to play in this season, and that's a possibility that we have.\"\n\nRead the full analysis of Mikel Arteta's use of Bukayo Saka here",

    "fullText": "In today’s financial landscape of Major League Baseball, record-setting contracts aren’t just about reward — they’re statements about impact, durability, and the evolving definition of elite performance. The highest-paid players in the sport represent more than statistical production; they embody the traits organizations believe can shape competitive windows, anchor rosters, and deliver sustained excellence over time. This particular group reflects a fascinating cross-section of modern baseball value: generational versatility, advanced hitting intelligence, dynamic offensive energy, and frontline pitching stability.\n\nAt the top end, the sport is witnessing unprecedented investment in players who fundamentally change how the game is played or how teams are built around them. Whether it’s redefining positional expectations, controlling the strike zone with rare precision, or serving as a lineup’s emotional and strategic centerpiece, these athletes influence far more than the box score. Their skill sets force opponents to adjust game plans, alter pitching strategies, and rethink defensive positioning on a nightly basis.\n\nEqually important is the diversity of excellence represented here. Some players dominate through explosive offensive production and relentless pressure on defenses, while others establish their value through consistency, durability, and the ability to perform in the sport’s most demanding moments. These contracts signal a clear industry reality: teams are willing to invest heavily in players who combine performance, reliability, and transformational presence. In many ways, this list reflects how baseball increasingly rewards players who don’t just contribute — they fundamentally shift competitive balance.\n\nAnnual Average Value: $70M \nOhtani is baseball’s ultimate unicorn — a true two-way superstar who dominates both on the mound and at the plate. His rare skill set reshapes how teams think about roster construction and value. Beyond the stats, he carries global star power that transcends the sport. Simply put, he’s redefining what a modern baseball icon looks like.\n\nAnnual Average Value: $60M\nTucker blends elite power, disciplined hitting, and smooth defense into one complete package. He’s become a central offensive engine and a consistent run producer in high-pressure moments. Quietly efficient but extremely impactful, he does the small things that win games. His steady rise reflects both production and long-term trust from his organization.\n\nAnnual Average Value: $51M \nSoto is one of the most advanced hitters of his generation, known for extraordinary plate discipline and clutch power. His command of the strike zone feels almost surgical, forcing pitchers to adjust to him rather than the other way around. He brings swagger, patience, and big-moment confidence to every at-bat. Teams pay a premium for hitters who can control games without swinging wildly — and that’s Soto’s specialty.\n\nAnnual Average Value: $42M \nBichette plays with an energetic, attacking style that keeps pressure on opposing defenses. He’s a dynamic offensive catalyst who consistently produces extra-base hits and drives scoring rallies. His intensity and confidence help set the tone for his lineup. When he’s locked in, he brings a spark that changes the rhythm of a game.\n\nAnnual Average Value: $42M \nWheeler has built his reputation on power pitching and relentless consistency. His fastball command and deep-game durability make him a true workhorse in an era of specialized bullpens. He thrives in high-leverage situations where poise matters as much as velocity. Teams value pitchers who anchor rotations — and Wheeler does exactly that.\n\nTogether, these five contracts capture the modern blueprint for baseball’s most valuable assets: versatility, precision, consistency, and game-changing presence. Each player represents a different pathway to elite status, yet all command premium investment because of the tangible advantage they provide. As salaries continue to climb, lists like this reveal not just who excels today — but what the sport believes winning will require tomorrow.\n\nOLYMPICS: 2026 Winter Olympics medal count, standings entering February 17\n\nNFL: Tyreek Hill makes hilarious first move after Dolphins release\n\nCBB: 2026 college basketball rankings, updated AP Top 25 after Week 15\n\nMLB: Tigers infielder from Taiwan apologizes to Koreans after trash talk goes viral\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: College Hall of Famer, father of Chicago Bulls coach, dies\n\nVIRAL: Chloe Kim ‘obsessed’ with $100k gift from NFL star Myles Garrett after Olympics\n\nThe post Top 5 highest paid athletes across MLB appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Micah Parsons has unloaded on Skip Bayless in a furious rant about the TV analyst.\n\nThe 74-year-old has enjoyed a legendary career in the sports media industry, but he has annoyed many people along the way.\n\nAmong those is Parsons, whom Bayless often criticized when he played for the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nBayless was even pleased when the Cowboys traded the defensive star to the Green Bay Packers last offseason.\n\nParsons has now hit back at the TV personality with some harsh words on the trajectory of his career.\n\nParsons was asked about sports pundits generally, and singled out Bayless as someone he dislikes.\n\nParsons argued that he is better than Bayless at talking about sports, while the former ESPN star could never do his job in the NFL.\n\nAnyone who has followed Bayless’ career will know to expect a passionate response in the next few days.\n\n“F— Skip Bayless,” Parsons said. “F— all of them. I don’t give a f—. They want to ragebait me, but they won’t say it to my face.\n\n“I’ll tell you how it is. You suck. Your show doesn’t work anymore. What are we talking about?\n\n“[They will] tell you how to play the game. Come play my position, Skip, because I can do what you do. I do it better sometimes.”\n\nParsons also spoke about former Super Bowl-winning tight end Shannon Sharpe, who has transitioned into the media industry.\n\nParsons showed much more respect for Sharpe, as he tends to give less controversial takes than Bayless.\n\n“Shay Shay lives on both sides,” he claimed. “He knows how to play the fine line between a player and a show.\n\n“He plays it like, ‘He doesn’t really show up when it matters, but he’s a good player.’\n\n“Sometimes, he can let those ESPN writers get to him a little bit, I can tell.”\n\nJosh Allen gets voted NFL’s most loved player by fans, Aaron Rodgers makes top 10 list\n\nJerry Jones sends strong message to Cowboys fans after watching Seahawks beat Patriots in Super Bowl LX\n\nChad Johnson says he would fix everyone’s problems if he had ‘Jeff Bezos type money’",

    "fullText": "Benjamin Nygren scores. Kilmarnock 2 Celtic 3. Scottish Premiership. Sunday 15 February 2026. Photo Vagelis Georgariou (The Celtic Star)\n\nThe Rugby Park captain insisted the defeat at the hands of the Hoops was down to their own errors rather than any decisions made by the match officials.\n\nKilmarnock were left heartbroken after Julian Araujo struck deep into stoppage time to seal victory for Martin O’Neill’s title chasers.\n\nJulian Araujo celebrates at Rugby Park, Kilmarnock 2 Celtic 3. Scottish Premiership. Sunday 15 February 2026. Photo Vagelis Georgariou (The Celtic Star)\n\nWhile Celtic had already snatched a late win in Ayrshire earlier this season with an injury-time penalty courtesy of Kelechi Iheanacho, Lyons believes this collapse was far more difficult to take.\n\nHaving led 2-0 at the break, the skipper admitted the team only had themselves to blame for letting the advantage slip, pointing to costly mistakes that ultimately proved decisive.\n\nSpeaking via Daily Record, Lyons said: “It was probably the sorest defeat I can remember to date, but it makes it even more sore when we concede from two long throw-ins.\n\n“I think that’s three long throw-ins in two games we’ve conceded from and then we’ve lost the game. The way we implemented our game plan was absolutely brilliant, but we shot ourselves in our own foot, so it’s devastating.\n\n“We have chances to maybe put the game to bed because obviously 3-0 is more comfortable than 2-0. It’s always that dodgy scoreline, but if you give us a 2-0 lead at half-time, we would snap your arm off against anyone, even though Celtic has their qualities. But, against anyone at half-time going in 2-0, you should be winning the game.”\n\nNeil McCann, Media Conference at Rugby Park. Kilmarnock 2 Celtic 3. Scottish Premiership. Sunday 15 February 2026. Photo Vagelis Georgariou (The Celtic Star)\n\nKilmarnock manager Neil McCann cut an angry figure over the decision to add seven minutes of stoppage time. However, when questioned on whether he felt the duration of added time was excessive, Lyons refused to criticise the officials.\n\n“It’s clutching at straws really, isn’t it?” Lyons said. “I went down with a head injury, Dom [Thompson] went down with a head injury, there’s a few subs and stuff. So, no, we’re not blaming anyone, we’re blaming ourselves for conceding those two late goals.\n\n“You’ve seen it again, we’re 2-0 up and then we make two mistakes like that towards the end of the game and it just kills us. That’s football, especially football at the highest level. I would say if you go through more or less every goal, there’s a mistake in it, so you try and cut them, you try and keep them to a minimum.\n\n“It’s sort of been a story all season that mistakes has killed us and big mistakes, but we’ll dust ourselves down, we’ll take the positives out of it, we’ll work on our negatives and go again next Saturday.”\n\nSeven Minutes added at Rugby Park as Martin O’Neill looks on. Kilmarnock 2 Celtic 3. Scottish Premiership. Sunday 15 February 2026. Photo Vagelis Georgariou (The Celtic Star)\n\nSo there you have it Neil McCann. Not even your own captain can bring himself to distort reality enough trying to claim that the time added on was unjustified. All it achieved was making Celtic’s victory all the more delicious knowing just how much it got to YOU.  Cheer up Neil.\n\nIncidentally here are the highlights from Rugby Park WITHOUT the commentary.

    "fullText": "Birmingham City have confirmed the sale of their women’s team to Shelby Companies Limited (SCL).\n\nThe Championship club, owned by Americans Tom Wagner and NFL legend Tom Brady, announced that SCL combined with several independent investors to complete the purchase.\n\nSCL have acquired a 97% stake in the team, while the remaining three per cent was purchased by a group of independent investors.\n\nThis group includes popular businesswomen and world-renowned sporting icons.\n\nOne of the biggest names on the board is Birmingham and England Lionesses legend Karen Carney.\n\nCarney is one of the most respected figures in club football. She represented England 144 times during an outstanding international career.\n\nSince retiring from football, she has become a familiar and trusted voice on television, working as a pundit and commentator for broadcasters including ITV and TNT Sports.\n\nAnother high-profile investor in the Championship club is former World Tennis Association (WTA) number one Kim Clijsters.\n\nClijsters won multiple Grand Slam titles during a remarkable tennis career.\n\nOne of her most memorable achievements came at the US Open. She won the tournament as an unseeded player after stepping away from tennis to become a mother.\n\nClijsters was also appointed Honorary President of the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2022.\n\nBirmingham believe that the acquisition will “elevate the focus on the women’s team and help it to deliver on the stated ambition for the Club to compete at the highest levels in the women’s game”.\n\nThe new ownership group has decided against making immediate changes, so the current leadership team will continue running the day-to-day operations at the club.\n\nThe Birmingham City Women’s Football Club Board said: “The ambition is to go beyond anything that Birmingham City Women has achieved before – domestically and internationally.\n\n“And in the process, inspire a new generation of young girls, who will get the opportunity to perform in the planned women’s stadium within the Birmingham Sports Quarter.\n\n“This transaction will be a catalyst to make it happen.”",

    "description": "Here are some potential targets if the Eagles move off Jahan Dotson and explore free agency to find a replacement.",
    "fullText": "The life of a slot receiver on a Nick Sirianni-led Philadelphia Eagles team can be pretty uneventful. Sure, you're on the field, but for the most part, you're seen as expendable. Shortly after entering the NovaCare Complex, you were told that A.J. Brown, DeVonta Smith, and Dallas Goedert will get the lion's share of targets.\n\nJahan Dotson's fate seemed sealed once we learned that Philadelphia was declining the fifth-year option on his rookie deal. There's been no extension announced, so we're going to assume we've seen his last game in an Eagles jersey. Here are a few options if free agency is explored to find a replacement.\n\nMaybe he's too rich for the Eagles' blood. Maybe he's less expensive than exercising Dotson's fifth-year option would have been. Who knows? One thing is certain. Alec Pierce is more than likely on the lists of every NFL team that will shop for a new wide receiver on the open market.\n\nDeebo Samuel doesn't have much left. Jauan Jennings seems to be too rich for Philadelphia's blood (and that's if he gets out of San Francisco). Rashid Shaheed is, seemingly, however, everything that Quez Watkins was supposed to become.\n\nHe has the hands that Watkins never had. Hmmm... Did Shaheed even drop a pass this season? Oh, and by the way, he's a nice option to return kicks, something the Eagles struggled with last season.\n\nIf Romeo Doubs were to land in Philadelphia, he might change Coach Sirianni's mind about ignoring the third receiver. This young man is too good to ignore.\n\nHe consistently wins contested catches, but sometimes that's a sign of something else. 'Contested catches' can sometimes mean guys are struggling to get open.\n\nEverything we've seen from Wan'Dale Robinson has come from seeing him play on an NFC East rival's roster. Often, he has had to do that without decent quarterback play. The G-Men added Jaxson Dart, and that helped. He had the best season of his career with Malik Nabers out.\n\nRobinson notched 92 receptions, 1,014 yards, and four TDs. He averages 9.2 yards per reception for his career, so he hasn't traveled very far down the field for the most part, but in this offense, the underneath stuff might be all that he needs to do.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Eagles Wire: NFL Free Agency: 4 targets Eagles could sign to replace Jahan Dotson",

    "fullText": "UFC Houston goes down on February 21st and features a main event between former middleweight champion Sean Strickland and surging contender Anthony Hernandez. It’s been just over a year since Sean Strickland has fought, which is a long time for a guy who has been getting two bouts every twelve months like clockwork for years in the UFC.\n\nThe reason why he disappeared after his last middleweight title challenge against Dricus du Plessis at UFC 312? He stepped into the cage at an event he was cornering and punched a fighter in the face.\n\nBut according to Strickland, getting suspended in June and having to take all that time off was actually great.\n\nSean Strickland on if he regrets his 6 month NSAC suspension from the UFC\n\n“I don’t get to hit cops often and not go to jail. It was the disrespect he gave me. If he would’ve just taken his W and shut the f**k up it would’ve been fine but you had to go and be a f*****g d*ckhead” pic.twitter.com/PXOYYyEImh\n\n— FULL SEND MMA (@full_send_mma) February 18, 2026\n\n“I mean, the suspension was dope, man,” Sean told Full Send MMA. “A bunch of injuries got healed up. I don’t get to hit cops often and not go to jail too, which is nice. That’s cool. I didn’t know he was a cop at first, but it made it significantly better, that six months. I’m like, ‘Ah f–k it, I’m down for this.’”\n\nIt was a Tuff-N-Uff event in Las Vegas where Strickland was cornering teammate Miles Hunsinger that things went awry. Hunsinger got submitted by his opponent Luis Hernandez in the second round, and Hernandez then threw some crotch chops in the direction of Hunsinger’s corner, which featured Sean Strickland and Chris Curtis.\n\n“Let me tell you: it had nothing to do with my boy losing,” Strickland said. “I mean, dude, we all lose fights. Like nothing to do with it. It was the disrespect you gave to me, dog. Like, if you would’ve just took your W and just shut the f–k up, nothing would’ve [happened], it’d be fine. But you had to go be a dickhead.”\n\n“Like, I was cool to you. I didn’t make fun of you, dude. And, you know, I’m pro ICE, dawg. Like, I’m pro cop. Why you gotta go put me that shit on me? F–k you.”\n\nStrickland barging into the cage and slugging Hernandez resulted in “Tarzan” receiving an indefinite suspension which sat over him like a black cloud for months before the NSAC finally set the punishment at $5,000 and six months.\n\nOn the plus side, we don’t doubt Strickland has been fighting through some bad injuries because we saw it in the DDP fight. Sean went into that fight with a serious shoulder problem and never managed to get anything going. He’ll need to be in top shape if he wants to get past “Fluffy” Hernandez, who has promised to ‘f–king torture’ Strickland for his pro-ICE comments.",

Mertens earned her spot by beating Marie Bouzkova in the second round.\n\nThe American holds a perfect 4-0 record against Mertens, most recently winning their match at the 2024 Indian Wells Open with a commanding scoreline of 6-0, 6-2.\n\nAfter the match, Gauff spoke about what she changed from their previous meeting, where Kalinskaya had come out on top.\n\n“Just trying to be more positive,” Gauff said. “Yeah, it wasn’t the prettiest win, but it was enough for today.”\n\nThe American then touched on the windy conditions in Dubai before discussing her recovery ahead of her next match.\n\nShe said: “Yeah it was pretty windy, I felt it a lot on that side so I was just trying to adjust and I think both of us were struggling with consistency on the court.\n\n“I think all week… at least when I’ve been here, it’s not been windy. So a little bit today was a bit different.”\n\nWhen asked how she is feeling going into her next match in Qatar, Gauff replied: “I mean, I feel fine. It wasn’t that long of a match today.\n\n“I think it’s more so just trying to work on the things that I need for tomorrow’s match.”\n\nHernan Casanova ban: When will the Argentine return to tennis?\n\nNick Kyrgios reacts on Instagram after helping sell out Madison Square Garden\n\nCarlos Alcaraz says if he would like to drive a Formula One car after meeting Fernando Alonso and Carlos Sainz",

    "description": "The four-time world champion previously claimed the new F1 regulations are like \"Formula E on steroids\", revealing that he doesn't like driving the 2026 cars",
    "fullText": "Max Verstappen has doubled down on his criticism of the 2026 Formula 1 regulations, stating the championship must “stay away” from becoming Formula E.\n\nThe four-time world champion caused a huge stir during last week’s Bahrain pre-season test, when he labelled the new F1 rule set as “anti-racing” and “Formula E on steroids”.\n\nThis comes as the F1 power unit is now more reliant on electrical energy with a near 50-50 split against the internal combustion engine, meaning battery harvesting will play a greater role at grands prix.\n\nIt may include drivers downshifting on straights to preserve energy, and this is similar to Formula E, where racers often deliberately drop back to save battery before launching late attacks.\n\nVerstappen is against all of this and, when asked on Wednesday if more Formula E drivers may enter F1 because of their experience with battery management, or if the all-electric championship could even become a feeder series, the Red Bull racer said: “Well, let's hope not.\n\n“I mean, not about the drivers, because there are a lot of good drivers that would be able to perform also really well here. But I don't want us to be close to Formula E.\n\n“I want us to actually stay away from that and be Formula 1. So don't increase the battery. Actually, get rid of that and focus on a nice engine and have Formula E as Formula E, because that's what they are about.\n\n“I'm sure that with the new car [Gen4] from what I've seen and talked to some of my friends in there, that's going to be also a really cool car. But let them be Formula E and we should stay Formula 1, and let's try not to mix that.”\n\nVerstappen’s comments are just an example of how the 2026 regulations have divided opinion, as reigning world champion Lando Norris claimed that the new cars are “a lot of fun”.\n\n“I'm just sharing my opinion,” added the Dutchman, when asked if he received any pushback from the authorities over his criticism.\n\n“We live in a free world, free speech and yeah, that's what I felt. Not everyone needs to feel like that, but that's how I felt and it also doesn't matter, of course, what other people have to say about that. It's just I got a question and I shared my opinion.\n\n“I think that I'm allowed to do [that]. So it's not about receiving pushback or whatever.”\n\nRed Bull: Can't make Verstappen happier about 2026 F1 cars, but can build him a winning one\n\nWhat Verstappen means by warning of F1 2026 \"disaster\" to come\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "Scotland's incredible dismantling of England prompted joyous scenes among their fans, but also left a familiar question hanging in the air - can they back it up?\n\nThe Scots have beaten England eight times in the Six Nations, with the first victory in 2000 coming in the final round of the Championship.\n\nFollowing six of the other seven triumphs, Scotland have gone on to lose their next match.\n\nWhich brings us to Principality Stadium on Saturday. Round three and an opportunity for Scotland to properly put themselves in the mix for the title.\n\nThe emotional and physical energy expended in delivering these incredible Calcutta Cup victories has proved hard for Scotland to recover from and then replicate.\n\nScotland bounced back brilliantly from the gut punch of defeat to Italy in Rome to dispatch England in sensational fashion, but the memories of the Stadio Olimpico will remain with them, serving as a cautionary tale as they prepare to face a Wales side at a low ebb.\n\n\"We'll obviously be sitting there with Italy in the back of our mind and that performance,\" Scotland second row Scott Cummings said.\n\n\"We know that we can't let our performance dip to that point again. We know that we can push on and we believe we can push on. But the weekend was just a start for us, now we need to back it up.\n\n\"In the nicest way possible, we've beaten England before. We've done this before in the Six Nations quite a few times and we probably haven't backed it up after that, so that's definitely a big focus for us.\"\n\nPodcast: Can Scotland back it up?\n\nScotland trio ruled out for visit to Wales\n\nThe latest Scottish rugby news, views & analysis\n\nCaptain Sione Tuipulotu spoke before the England match about how Scotland were \"a desperate team\" with their Six Nations hopes on the line.\n\nThat desperation for a win surely applies to Wales this weekend.\n\nSteve Tandy, the former Scotland defence coach now in charge of Wales, has watched his side get battered in their opening two matches against England and France.\n\nThey sit bottom of the table having scored only 19 points across two games while conceding 102.\n\nFrance ran riot with eight tries in Cardiff to consign Wales to a 13th consecutive Six Nations defeat.\n\nYet Scotland have had enough bad experiences in Cardiff to never take a victory for granted, even with Welsh rugby in dire straits.\n\n\"I obviously know some of their coaching staff, Steve Tandy and [former Glasgow head coach] Danny Wilson,\" Cummings said.\n\n\"They'll be obviously pretty up for this game, having worked with us in the past.\n\n\"We're expecting a pretty solid, gritty performance from them, and they'll definitely be tough to break down.\n\n\"They're going to be a team that's obviously hurting and, like we were last week, that often brings the best out in teams. So we're expecting a massive fight from them.\n\n\"I want the heat on us. We need to view every single moment as the most important moment of the match. If we don't, then I don't think we'll get the win out of it. So I don't think the pressure's off us.\n\n\"In international rugby, the pressure's always on you to perform well. I think for us it's going to be a massive game, but we're definitely not resting on the weekend being a finished performance.\"",

    "description": "Microsoft says it is on track to invest $50 billion by the end of the decade to help bring artificial intelligence to lower-income countries, as concerns mount over the technology’s potential to deepen inequality.",
    "fullText": "Microsoft says it is on track to invest $50 billion by the end of the decade to help bring artificial intelligence to lower-income countries, as concerns mount over the technology’s potential to deepen inequality.\n\nThe announcement was made Wednesday at the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, where leading tech executives, government officials and AI researchers are debating how to use AI to solve real-world problems.\n\nPolicymakers globally are increasingly worried that the unequal adoption of AI risks widening income and development gaps between rich and poor countries. In December, the United Nations Development Project called for global cooperation on standards and safety to ensure the technology “functions as a shared public good rather than a concentrated advantage.”\n\nAt the summit, Microsoft likewise expressed the need for cross-border partnerships to prevent poorer countries from being left behind.\n\n“We need to act with urgency to address the growing AI divide,” Microsoft president Brad Smith and chief responsible AI officer Natasha Crampton said in a joint statement. “Artificial intelligence is diffusing at an impressive speed, but its adoption around the world remains profoundly uneven.”\n\nThe company’s $50 billion commitment to developing economies by 2030 compares with the roughly $80 billion that Microsoft invested into data centers last year alone, more than half of which was directed to a single economy: the United States.\n\nA recent Microsoft report found that AI usage in the global north, a catch-all term for developed and high-income countries, is roughly twice that of the global south — and growing.\n\n“This disparity impacts not only national and regional economic growth, but whether AI can deliver on its broader promise of expanding opportunity and prosperity around the world,” Smith and Crampton said.\n\nThey warned that, just as unequal access to electricity has exacerbated a growing economic gap between the global north and south, without urgent action, the AI divide could perpetuate that disparity in the century ahead.\n\nOn the other hand, the technology could be used positively to help poor countries leapfrog older development pathways. “If AI is deployed broadly and used well by a young and growing population, it offers a real prospect for catch-up economic growth for the Global South,” said Smith and Crampton.\n\n“It might even provide the biggest such opportunity of the 21st century,” the pair said.\n\nMicrosoft’s $50 billion investment will, among other things, help to build the data centers crucial to providing the computing power needed to run AI models. Extending internet access is another focus.\n\nOnly about 36% of Africa’s population had broadband internet access in 2022, according to the World Bank. That compares with some 90% of US households, official figures show.\n\nThe AI Impact Summit, hosted by India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, highlights the country’s ambition to position itself as an AI leader in the global south.\n\nHigh-profile attendees include Sam Altman of OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Google CEO Sundar Pichai who is due to deliver a keynote address on Friday.",

    "title": "OpenAI, Meta, and Apple's latest battle: Breaking your phone addiction",
    "description": "The tech companies that created our phone addiction are trying to cure us with AI wearables.",
    "fullText": "The average American picks up their phone more than 200 times a day. Teens are pinged with some 250 notifications a day — during school, after school, and overnight. The apps meant to prevent you from checking apps have done little to stop the problem. Now, some of the tech companies that helped create our screen dependence are trying to disrupt it.\n\nLater this year, OpenAI plans to debut a small, screenless device that Sam Altman describes as more \"peaceful\" than a smartphone. Apple, the Oz of screentime, is developing smart glasses, a pin, and AirPods with more AI built in, according to a Tuesday report from Bloomberg, with the rumored pendants featuring microphones and cameras to be the \"eyes and ears\" of the iPhone. Meta has teased its fully augmented reality Orion glasses since 2024. While that device doesn't have a release date, the company last year sold some 7 million pairs of its smart glasses, which is the start of the post-smartphone future Mark Zuckerberg has predicted. Eventual smart specs could be more screen all-the-time than screenless, but they also rely on AI to make the experience much more hands-free than swiping and scrolling on a phone.\n\nCould AI be what finally breaks our phone addiction?\n\nSince 2007, no device out of Silicon Valley has captured universal imagination the way Steve Jobs did when he put your iPod, your phone, and the internet together on a 3.5-inch screen. Competitors have tried for a decade-plus to get people to shift us from the iPhone to smart glasses, and largely failed. The awe around smartphones has turned to derision, as excessive screen time is linked to disrupted sleep, anxiety, and fractured attention. Now, developers are hoping the AI boom can give us the next big thing.\n\nBeating the smartphone would mean replacing a device that 91% of American adults now carry — a device for which millions of apps have been developed and people now depend on in lieu of wallets and cameras and health monitors. New AI devices can't just copy what smartphones do, says Ramon Llamas, a research director at a technology intelligence firm IDC: They have to show they have a solution to an everyday problem. If they don't, Llama says, \"these things are just gonna really end up as solutions looking for a problem to solve.\"\n\nCritiques of screen time can be as blunt and smoothbrained as what the critics say excessive screen time makes you. A seven-hour daily log may seem like a staggering amount of dependence, but what did the person spend those seven hours doing? Doomscrolling late into the night, or FaceTiming with a far-away friend? With AI wearables, there's the risk of becoming dependent on the device for different reasons.\n\n\"The screen may not be there, but what's getting filled in the back is already this problem of AI companionship,\" says Olivia Gambelin, an AI ethicist and author of the book \"Responsible AI.\" An AI device designed to do something very specific — like listen to a meeting and then send follow-up emails or messages related to action points discussed — could save people time and keep them from writing tedious emails and Slack messages from their desk. But that same device listening in to personal conversations with family and friends could compromise a relationship, and erode the positive effects that texting a friend to check-in can have on both people (already, my friends are tiring of AI summaries on the iPhone that summarize our group text and become an intermediary into our threads of gossip and jokes in the name of efficiency). Wearing microphones and cameras to social interactions and into businesses is likely to really weird out some of the people around you. More people are entering into romantic, dependent relationships with AI companions, and a swell of loud dissenters are criticizing the technology for taking jobs and attempting to replicate human relationships.\n\nBut OpenAI is betting that it can package its technology in a device in a way that calms the user. \"When I use current devices or most applications, I feel like I am walking through Times Square in New York and constantly just dealing with all the little indignities along the way,\" Altman said in November. OpenAI's device, he said, would be less Time Square, more \"sitting in the most beautiful cabin by a lake and in the mountains and sort of just enjoying the peace and calm.\" That's because the AI device would learn \"contextual awareness of your whole life,\" and when best to send you alerts.\n\nOther AI wearables have failed by falling short of that goal. Humane AI sold a wearable pin, priced at $700 plus a monthly fee to connect it, but pulled it from the market a year ago. It failed perhaps because it tried too hard to replace our phones — it didn't interact with them, but provided a shoddy replacement. Novelty wasn't a factor that could outshine usability. The AI Friend pendant, which can't search the internet or help with tasks outside of sending reminders and acts instead as an eavesdropping sycophant around its user's neck, was mocked relentlessly and sold just a few thousand devices after it hit the market last year.\n\nCompanies trying to make AI hardware should focus on \"transformative features,\" Jason Low, research director at Omdia, tells me in an email. AI wearables must be more than \"marginally more convenient,\" should integrate with our existing products, and have a clear, stated value. For example, glasses that provide real-time language translation or devices for fitness and health tracking offer features our smartphones can't do as well. The Oura ring continues to grow in popularity, particularly among women after starting out as a niche tech bro buy, for the novel insights it can offer; the company announced last fall it has sold 5.5 million rings since 2015, with more than 2.5 million sold between June 2024 and September 2025. \"These devices often deliver a more polished user experience compared to general-purpose, do-it-all AI devices,\" Low says.\n\nLlamas tells me that the AI functions of a wearable have to be \"contextual, personalized, and actionable,\" like reminding the wearer to send birthday flowers or responding accurately to being asked to direct the user to the nearest Starbucks. A first attempt device shouldn't try to replace the smartphone, but to integrate with the Apple or Google ecosystems, he says. Apple and OpenAI did not respond to requests for comment about their rumored products for this story.\n\nIf anything has hyped Silicon Valley like the iPhone, it's been AI. But three years after the mainstream adoption of ChatGPT, the value generative AI in the white collar workforce has yet to be fully realized. That could make a product for consumers a hard sell, too. \"Some of the overwhelm that's coming with AI that I see in general users is you can use it for everything, or it's promoted that way, which is actually quite stifling,\" Gambelin says.\n\nIn our quest to find a peaceful equilibrium with tech, the screen itself may not be the problem; it's what's summoning us to the screen. Its bright colors, games, and infinite scroll give quick dopamine hits that entice us to stay glued to it. But much of what pings my phone throughout the day are useless notifications trying to get me to reopen one of the dozens of apps — a markdown moment on a clothing thrifting app, a like on the Instagram story I've posted of my dog from my best friend, and ironically, a report of how much time I've already logged. There's a relentless business model at play to keep us on these apps. No screens would mean no infinite scroll through TikTok, no Candy Crush — but app developers and companies may need to find new ways to reach people if wearables caught on, and an always-there AI device and companion might not be as peaceful as Altman describes. Our collective screen time is a problem, but the AI wearable will have to surprise us all with something novel to be useful.\n\nAmanda Hoover is a senior correspondent at Business Insider covering the tech industry.

    "fullText": "True artificial general intelligence is on the way, but it still has some ways to go, said Google DeepMind's CEO.\n\nSpeaking at an AI summit in New Delhi, Demis Hassabis was asked whether current AGI systems can match human intelligence. AGI is a hypothetical form of machine intelligence that can reason like people and solve problems using methods it was not trained in.\n\nHassabis' short answer: \"I don't think we are there yet.\"\n\nHe listed three areas where current AGI systems are falling short. The first was what he called \"continual learning,\" saying that the systems are frozen based on the training they received before implementation.\n\n\"What you'd like is for those systems to continually learn online from experience, to learn from the context they're in, maybe personalize to the situation and the tasks that you have for them,\" he said during the discussion.\n\nSecondly, Hassabis said current systems struggle with long-term thinking.\n\n\"They can plan over the short term, but over the longer term, the way that we can plan over years, they don't really have that capability at the moment,\" he said.\n\nAnd lastly, he said that the systems lack consistency. They're adept in some areas and unskilled in others.\n\n\"So, for example, today's systems can get gold medals in the international Math Olympiad, really hard problems, but sometimes can still make mistakes on elementary maths if you pose the question in a certain way,\" he said. \"A true general intelligence system shouldn't have that kind of jaggedness.\"\n\nHumans, in comparison, would not make mistakes on an easy math problem if they were math experts, he added.\n\nHassabis said in a \"60 Minutes\" interview last year that true AGI would arrive in five to 10 years.\n\nThe executive cofounded DeepMind, an AI research lab, in 2010. The lab was acquired by Google in 2014 and is the brains behind Google's Gemini. In 2024, Hassabis won a joint Nobel Prize in chemistry for his work on protein structure prediction.\n\nAGI is a disputed topic in Silicon Valley. Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi said at a September conference that current AI chatbots already meet the definition of AGI, but Silicon Valley leaders keep \"moving the goalposts\" and pushing toward superintelligence, or AI that can outthink humans.\n\nThe AI Summit in India, from Monday to Friday this week, has attracted big names from the tech and AI spheres. Notable speakers on the summit's agenda include OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Meta's chief AI officer, Alexandr Wang.",

That includes a massive shift in the work software engineers do across industries.\n\n\"I think today coding is practically solved for me, and I think it'll be the case for everyone regardless of domain,\" Cherny said in the interview, published Tuesday. \"I think we're going to start to see the title 'software engineer' go away. And I think it's just going to be maybe builder, maybe product manager, maybe we'll keep the title as a vestigial thing.\"\n\nCherny added that software engineers will not only be coding but increasingly taking on other tasks like \"writing specs\" — a document that defines what and how something will be built — or talking to users.\n\n\"Like this thing that we're starting to see right now in our team, where engineers are very much generalists, and every single function on our team codes,\" he said — including product managers, designers, engineering manager, and finance people.\n\nTech executives and founders have said advancements in AI have rapidly changed the way their teams operate in the past few years\n\nJesal Gadhia, a startup founder, recently told Business Insider that all the code for his company were written by agents, which wouldn't have been possible in 2024.\n\nAgents like Claude have changed how software engineers work as they spend more time reviewing or debugging code rather than writing lines of it.\n\nSome in the industry have started to note the unintended consequences of relying on AI. A software engineer told Business Insider that AI has simultaneously made them productive and overworked, leading to \"AI fatigue.\"\n\nAndrej Karpathy, a founding member of OpenAI and Tesla's ex-head of AI, said in January that he has noticed his ability to manually code has started to \"atrophy.\"",

    "description": "The SaaSpocalypse fears are overblown. AI's integration into enterprise software may boost, not harm, established SaaS companies.",
    "fullText": "The recent AI-inspired software meltdown is an enormous overreaction. SaaS companies are going to do just fine. In fact, they might see their businesses boom as a result of AI.\n\nAfter working for decades in the IT and cloud sectors, I know what it takes to build, sell, and maintain complex enterprise software. And it's clear to me that AI is not the threat that many investors fear.\n\nLet's look at the three main concerns that the market is obsessing over. All of them have shortcomings that will keep established SaaS vendors doing well.\n\nSoftware development has been transformed by AI. It's a near-perfect use case for generative AI: applying established patterns to a well-bounded use case, resulting in incredible productivity improvements.\n\nThis coding revolution has led some commentators to predict that companies are going to write their own software, rather than buy it from SaaS vendors.\n\nThis makes me wonder if these commentators have ever actually spent any time working in enterprise IT. Even if one accepts that software creation is much easier now, bringing a full software product to market requires much more than code:\n\nGeoffrey Moore, a renowned management consultant and organizational theorist, wrote a book called \"Crossing the Chasm\" on what mainstream enterprises need to adopt new technology. He never mentioned the cost of writing software code as a gating factor.\n\nOver the course of my long career, I have witnessed countless DIY failures by enterprise IT organizations that fail to understand the difference between an internal software project and a real product. I can already see another wave of failures, fueled by misplaced AI coding enthusiasm.\n\nAI prognosticators see cheaper startups displacing large software incumbents. This overlooks the reality that established SaaS providers already have smaller, cheaper competitors yet somehow remain dominant. The challenges for new entrants to a software sector include:\n\nIt's incredibly difficult for a small startup to displace an incumbent vendor. As Clayton Christensen observed in \"The Innovators Dilemma,\" innovative startups usually begin by solving use cases incumbent vendors are unable or unwilling to serve.\n\nLeft unaddressed in this scenario is why incumbents wouldn't just use AI themselves to improve engineering efficiency to address any price pressure from smaller new rivals.\n\nThis is the idea that AI model companies will extend their nascent software products into vertical offerings, thereby killing off incumbent vendors.\n\nOpenAI made a big splash with a healthcare initiative, for example. Anthropic caused a bunch of software stocks to drop with its plugins.\n\nIt's understandable why these companies launched these initiatives. Many industry-specific software companies are highly profitable, so AI labs would love to get a piece of this business.\n\nPursuing this, while working on other initiatives, could spread AI labs too thin, though. Startups often fail due to a lack of focus, and this is especially apropos for AI model makers. They face enormous, unprecedented opportunity, and getting distracted by bright, shiny vertical SaaS offerings is a terrible idea.\n\nGoing back to the DIY section above, there's huge complexity and cost to shipping and maintaining real enterprise software. Now multiple this by all the various industry verticals that exist, such as healthcare, financial services, and manufacturing. Addressing the idiosyncratic requirements of each sector would require huge numbers of employees, along with management time and attention. The model makers are already growing at breakneck speed; trying to add enough people to become vertical software providers would be a Sisyphean task.\n\nIf I were advising these boards, I would argue for focus: win the horizontal AI model layer in what is likely to become a small oligopoly.\n\nAnd yes, expand AI coding capabilities that lower the cost of development and increase the global population of software creators. That dynamic could trigger Jevons Paradox — cheaper software leading to vastly more of it — enriching the model providers without forcing them into every software vertical.\n\nThe SaaSpocalypse will, in retrospect, come to be thought of like the Beanie Babies mania: a short-lived phenomena that now seems inexplicable to comprehend.\n\nBernard Golden is CEO of Navica, a Silicon Valley-based technology analysis, consulting, and investment firm.",

Based on new survey results, Wall Street doesn't approve.\n\nBank of America surveyed 162 fund managers overseeing a combined $440 billion, and a record portion of them said they think companies are \"overinvesting\" in capex.\n\nOn top of that, more CIOs are leaning in favor of decreasing capex spending. Only 20% of survey respondents have advocated for increasing capex, down from 34%.\n\nThat may be because they see AI as an increasing risk to the market's strength in 2026. 25% of survey respondents reported that they see the AI bubble as the largest tail risk, more so than inflation, geopolitical conflict or a disorderly increase in bond yields.\n\nMeanwhile, a fair amount of investors made it clear that they believe AI hyperscaler capex poses another significant threat. 30% of survey respondents revealed that they see it as the most likely source of a systemic credit event.\n\nA year ago, it might have seemed absurd to suggest that tech companies should spend less money on building out AI models and infrastructure. But over the last few quarters, investors have raised the bar for what they expect from companies heavily investing in AI.",

    "description": "Student-loan borrowers pursuing Public Service Loan Forgiveness are facing worse delays in paperwork processing and looming limits to debt relief.",
    "fullText": "A major program for student-loan borrowers in public service is facing big changes — and delays.\n\nOver 7 million borrowers are pursuing the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which forgives student debt for government and nonprofit workers after 10 years of qualifying payments.\n\nThousands of those borrowers, though, might have completed their qualifying payments but are still waiting for relief. That's because they applied for the PSLF buyback, which allows borrowers to \"buy back\" months spent in deferment or forbearance periods by making payments equal to what they would have owed at the time. Borrowers can apply for a buyback only if those payments would enable them to reach the 120-payment threshold for relief.\n\nA recent court update from the Department of Education reported an increase in the backlog of buyback processing. The filing said that 83,370 applications were pending as of December 31. Over the month of December, the department approved 1,690 buyback applications and received an additional 5,090.\n\nThe department wrote in its filing that \"the PSLF Buyback database is dynamic; approval/denial data is inherently subject to change; and FSA can only see an application's current status, not past statuses.\"\n\n\"For example, an application might be closed in December because the application package was incomplete, but then reopened and approved in January after the application package is supplemented with the necessary information,\" the department said.\n\nSome borrowers seeking a PSLF buyback were also enrolled in the SAVE income-driven repayment plan, which would have allowed for cheaper monthly payments and a shorter timeline to debt relief. Due to litigation, the SAVE plan has been in forbearance for over a year, meaning borrowers were not receiving credit toward PSLF during that period. The buyback would allow some of those borrowers to receive relief.\n\nIn addition to the buyback, the Department of Education is set to implement a new rule this summer that would limit PSLF eligibility, a move critics said would lock some public service borrowers out of relief. More broadly, the department is working to implement its sweeping student-loan repayment changes, which include new income-driven repayment plans and borrowing caps. Borrowers could face higher monthly payments as a result.\n\nAt the end of October, the Department of Education finalized its rule to narrow employers' eligibility for PSLF following an executive order from President Donald Trump that called for the department to \"redefine\" public service.\n\nThe rule, set to go into effect in July 2026, would change the definition of a qualifying employer \"to exclude employers that participate in illegal activities such that they have a substantial illegal purpose.\"\n\nWhile there are no changes to the program yet, advocates have expressed concern that altering the program's eligibility could block some borrowers from debt relief if their employers' political views do not align with the administration's. Some of those advocates sued the administration; in November, for example, advocacy groups Protect Borrowers and Democracy Forward filed a lawsuit on behalf of over a dozen cities, labor unions, and nonprofits to block the rule from going into effect.\n\nIn a separate lawsuit, advocates said in a court filing last week that the department's rule is \"irremediably vague\" and that \"there is no evidence that the problem the Rule purports to address has ever arisen.\"\n\nUndersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a statement in response to the lawsuits that \"the final rule is crystal clear: the Department will enforce it neutrally, without consideration of the employer's mission, ideology, or the population they serve.\"\n\nWhile it's unclear how the lawsuits will evolve and how the department will implement the rule, some PSLF borrowers told Business Insider they're worried they'll lose the relief that they've been working toward.\n\n\"I'm so close to the finish line,\" Jeff Hughes, a PSLF borrower, said. \"I really hope that the program continues as is because we need some more good people out there doing good work.\"\n\nHave a story to share?

    "title": "A plastic surgeon said nearly half his work is revisions. The most common fixes include rhinoplasties and overdone fillers.",
    "description": "A plastic surgeon said he regularly fixes eye lifts, nose jobs, breast implants, and overdone filler injections.",
    "fullText": "As the demand for plastic surgery continues to grow, so does the desire for revisions.\n\nFollowing a pandemic-era boom in plastic surgery (with procedures increasing 19% from 2019 to 2022), about 1.6 million Americans got cosmetic surgery in 2024, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.\n\nWhen those cosmetic procedures go wrong — or simply could be improved upon — some patients go to Dr. Anthony Berlet, a board-certified plastic surgeon with practices in New York City and Cedar Grove, New Jersey.\n\n\"I have sort of a reputation for doing the redo surgeries,\" Berlet told Business Insider. \"I fix people up from botch-jobs, so I see a lot of it.\"\n\nOf the 176 surgeries he's performed in the last six months, nearly half, 43%, were patients seeking revisions after getting prior work done.\n\nPatients expected that some procedures, like breast implants, would need to be redone because they have \"expiration dates\" and need to be updated in 15 to 20 years. Others, like getting too much filler or a poorly done facelift, require touch-ups from Berlet.\n\nIt can be costly. In addition to the original procedure (the average facelift costs around $18,000 but can go up to $50,000 to $100,000), a facelift revision starts at about $25,000 for Berlet.\n\nStill, it's not slowing down business for Berlet, who said social media and heightened awareness of high-quality plastic surgery can make people seek out the best possible results — even if it takes a few tries to do so.\n\n\"Every day is a little bit of an adventure,\" he said. \"You see patients coming in and they've been living with crazy things, like awful nose jobs for years, and they just thought that was the natural course.\"\n\nBerlet shared his most commonly requested revision surgeries — and why seemingly simple procedures like filler injections can be costly to clean up.\n\nEye lifts have become one of the most popular plastic surgeries in the US. Berlet said they're his most commonly requested procedure in general. That included eye lift revisions, which made up 30% of his redo surgeries in the last six months.\n\n\"I do eyelid surgery literally every day,\" he said. Even if his patients, who mostly range between 40 and 70, had quality surgery in the past, it may not age very well because \"everyone ages a little bit differently.\" In general, he said they \"last\" 10 to 15 years before he recommends a touch-up.\n\n\"I see a lot of sags — the lower lids have too much bow to them, so you want to clean that up,\" he said. He said the eyes can have residual bags left over or hooding over the upper lids. \"There's a lot that goes on with eyes.\"\n\nAbout 20% of Berlet's revision requests were rhinoplasties, or nose jobs.\n\nHe said people who got nose jobs decades ago might have disliked the look for years or even struggled to breathe properly.\n\n\"The older rhinoplasty didn't rebuild the middle vault of the nose, which was really affected in breathing and gave it a pinched-in look in the middle,\" he said. Now, plastic surgeons like Berlet use spreader grafts — thin pieces of cartilage — to open the septum more, providing a stronger nasal structure.\n\nHe said improperly done nose jobs run the gamut, though. The tip of the nose can experience \"all kinds of warping\" if not reinforced properly. At Berlet's office, a revision usually starts at around $15,000.\n\nBreast implants, which made up around 15% of Berlet's revision surgeries, are often necessary updates on implants from decades ago.\n\n\"The older implants, they could get firm, they could malposition, they could create asymmetries,\" he said. Other people come in after having breast lifts and fills at the same time, \"so there's a multitude of things that can go wrong there,\" he said. According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, getting both procedures at once has a 23% complication rate, including hardening around the implant, scarring, and drooping.\n\nAt this point, Berlet usually just removes the implants without replacing them, returning their patients to their original breast sizes. He said he's considering using newer versions of implants in the future because they \"reduce the redo rate significantly.\" But for now, implants can be more trouble than they're worth.\n\n\"That was a big decision a couple of years ago,\" he said. \"I just stopped putting them in.\"\n\nBerlet said that close to 10% of his revisions are related to fat-grafting to tweak facelifts or, most commonly, overdone filler injections.\n\n\"It can look very unnatural once you overfill — you see that all the time,\" he said. Under-eye filler is one of the more common ones he tweaks. \"They're swollen because there's chronic inflammation.\"\n\nHe usually dissolves the filler and replaces it with the patient's own fat cells, taken from parts of the body like the abdomen or thighs. \" Fat-grafting provides a softer, more natural result,\" he said, because it integrates with the surrounding tissue in a way that synthetic filler cannot.\n\nWhile fat-grafting is more expensive and invasive than getting filler, patients also won't experience the same inflammation and side effects they do from filler migration. \"It also has stem cells that improve the quality of the skin,\" he said.\n\nBerlet said he performs 2 to 3 facelifts a week. At least half are redos, some of which involve removing excess filler.\n\n\"When you elevate the flaps for the facelift, some of it just literally oozes out,\" he said. Some of it is too embedded to be fully removed. \"You may leave some of it, but you're reshaping the face and getting everything back where it should be.\"\n\nWhen it comes to facelifts, he said the best results — like Kris Jenner's viral surgery — come from having work done in the past. \"I prefer to do a revision facelift,\" he said. \"You can modify the incisions — it's just hidden better. You can do all these things that make their first facelift look like a nightmare.\"\n\nSometimes, what drives people to get redos isn't necessarily bad work in the first place. It's knowing that subtler results are available.\n\n\"They come back and they're like, 'Oh my God, this is the greatest thing ever happened,'\" Berlet said. \"I get a little happiness out of that.\"",

    "description": "Irwin Simon became the CEO of Tilray in 2019. He starts his day by walking his dog in Central Park and ends the work week from the Hamptons.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Irwin Simon, the chairman and CEO of Tilray, based in New York City. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy career started 40 years ago as a life insurance salesperson. I didn't do that for too long because I didn't like selling something to someone who ultimately had to die to get it.\n\nI then became a salesman for an electronics company and later a brand manager for Häagen-Dazs Ice Cream in Canada. I moved to New York to work for Häagen-Dazs, which felt like getting my MBA in business.\n\nI next worked on an incredible brand called Grand Met (now Diageo), and then for SlimFast, where I got fired. The best thing that happened to me was getting fired. It makes you go back and rethink your career and yourself.\n\nI started a company, the Haines Celestial Group, in the natural and organic food and personal care industry. The company grew to make billions in revenue.\n\nIn 2019, I took over a company called Aphria, which later became Tilray, and became its chairman and CEO that March. Tilray is a pharmaceutical, cannabis-lifestyle, and consumer packaged goods company, with products across medical and adult-use cannabis, craft beer, spirits, beverages, and hemp foods.\n\nHere's what a typical day in my life looks like.\n\nWhen I wake up, I get out of bed. I don't lie in bed and read emails and newspapers. I also pray every morning. I'm a big believer in spirituality.\n\nI'll see if there are any texts, emails, or WhatsApp messages about anything urgent while I'm getting going.\n\nI'll then read The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, and The Washington Post. I also look at some online stuff to see if the press is saying anything nice or nasty about me.\n\nOn Tuesdays and Thursdays, I box at a gym. Every day that I'm home, I take my dog to Central Park, even on days when I'm boxing. We walk anywhere from three to four miles.\n\nI make my own coffee every day because I don't like going to get coffee. I have a paper cup that I take with me — I try to use it three to four days a week. I make ground coffee with cinnamon — I don't need fancy coffee.\n\nI'll have a little cereal and some bread with a little peanut butter. I don't sit down and have a full breakfast. I'll do some calls from home and some work because no one's there to bother me.\n\nI work seven days a week, 24 hours a day. I go into the office at least four days a week when I'm not traveling. On Friday, I like to either work from home or from the Hamptons.\n\nI'll typically take calls and meetings while I'm walking to the office. When I get to the office, I have meetings all day. I catch up on reviewing numbers and going through things.\n\nWe buy lunch for our 2,800 team members, who are mostly in the office, so I have lunch with them here. I'll have a salad and soup.\n\nMy afternoons are the same as the mornings. It's meetings, team calls, and I'm booked until the evening.\n\nThe big thing is, as a CEO, it's OK to be criticized. It's OK to be wrong, and it's important to get feedback. I hate being surrounded by yes people.\n\nIf you're not having fun, you're not enjoying your work. If you can't have fun while you enjoy your work, I feel bad for you.\n\nWhen my wife is away, I have flexibility and freedom, but I try to either do a business dinner or have dinner with people on my team. I recently had dinner with my medical team, for example, talking about medical cannabis legalization.\n\nAfter dinner, I enjoy watching sports and some Netflix — I love movies. I also turn on CNN or another news channel because I like to stay up to date on everything. I also scroll the Journal, the Times, and the Financial Post.\n\nI'll hang out with my dog while watching and reading, and power down after the workday.\n\nIf there are challenges or something happens within the business, I have to spend more time discussing it — that could derail my day. I also have four children, and they always come first if something is going on with them.\n\nAt the end of the day, I always ask myself, What did I accomplish today? Did I really accomplish and feel good about it, or not? What did I learn today?\n\nSleep is so important, and for me, I need seven hours of sleep a night.\n\nI put my phone away on Sundays while I'm watching Meet the Press or working on personal businesses I'm involved with.\n\nI make phone calls to my family, try to keep up with my siblings and friends, and fit in a personal life. CEO is a title, but you are a human being first.",

    "description": "Electric vehicle sales fell 3% worldwide in January compared to the same period last year, as the industry braces for a deep freeze.",
    "fullText": "The EV winter is going global — and even Tesla isn't immune.\n\nElectric vehicle sales across the auto industry fell 3% worldwide in January compared to the same period last year, according to data from Benchmark Intelligence published Friday, as policy changes in the US and China threaten to throw the industry into a deep freeze.\n\nIn North America and China, sales fell 33% and 20% respectively last month.\n\nEV sales in the US have plummeted since the removal of the $7,500 tax credit for new electric vehicles in September, and CEOs and industry experts have warned of a bumpy few years ahead.\n\nIn China, EVs accounted for around half of all vehicles sold last year — but companies are facing their own challenges after the government moved to end a key tax exemption for EV purchases and adjusted its trade-in scheme to make it less generous for battery-powered vehicles.\n\nChina's EV wobble has also hit its most successful foreign import — Tesla.\n\nElon Musk's automaker sold fewer than 20,000 vehicles in China in January, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association, its lowest figure since late 2022.\n\nUnlike many other Western carmakers in China, Tesla has largely managed to fend off a wave of local rivals and protect its market share in the world's largest auto market.\n\nHowever, a slowing EV market and a lack of new products — barring refreshes and variants, Tesla hasn't launched a new vehicle in China since the Model Y in 2021 — has left the US automaker vulnerable.\n\nIndustry data published last week suggests that Tesla's Model Y was outsold in January by more than two to one by Xiaomi's YU7, which was widely hailed as a serious rival to Tesla's bestselling EV when the smartphone maker launched it last June.\n\nAnd last year, BYD took Tesla's crown as the world's largest seller of battery-powered vehicles — although the Chinese company also saw its January sales fall 30% year over year, signaling a difficult start to 2026.\n\nOutside of China, things aren't looking much better for Tesla.\n\nThe company continues to struggle in Europe, after facing major backlash last year over CEO Musk's interventions into local politics and endorsement of the German far-right party AfD.\n\nDespite staging a recovery in some markets, such as Spain and Italy in January, Tesla's registrations also collapsed by 42% in France and fell to just 82 cars in EV-friendly Norway.\n\nIn the UK, where Tesla's Chinese rivals do not face tariffs, BYD sold four times as many cars as Tesla last month, after the Austin-based automaker's registrations fell by half.\n\nThe ongoing slump comes despite Europe being one of the few regions to see a bump in EV demand so far this year. Electric vehicle sales grew by nearly 25% year-over-year in January, per Benchmark figures.\n\nTesla's struggles in China and Europe mean its attempt to return to growth after two years of annual sales declines is off to a rough start.\n\nThe company has also faced a difficult spell in the US following the end of the tax credit, with sales in the final three months of 2025 falling 15% year over year, per figures from Cox Automotive — although the brand's January sales were only 2% lower than last year.\n\nTesla is by no means the only US automaker taking a hit in the EV market. The Detroit \"big three\" of Ford, GM, and Stellantis have collectively announced over $50 billion in charges related to their EV businesses in recent months, as they switch gears to sell more gas-powered and hybrid vehicles. Just 90,000 electric vehicles were sold in North America in January, according to Benchmark's figures.\n\nGetting caught in the EV winter might not bother Tesla's management, though, with the company rapidly shifting its focus away from the traditional auto industry.\n\nMusk told investors last month that Tesla will sunset its pioneering Model X and S models to build a new production line for its Optimus humanoid robot, and predicted that the company's upcoming Cybercab robotaxi will make current transportation methods obsolete.\n\n\"We're literally saying what we're going to do and have said what we're going to do for a while,\" Musk said\n\n\"I think long-term, really the only vehicles that we'll make will be autonomous vehicles, with the exception of the next-generation Roadster,\" he added.",

In the year leading up the last Friday, he noted that the gains in dollar-based assets have been the weakest when compared to 19 other markets around the world.\n\nThe S&P 500 is up 11% over the past year, compared to the 34% gain in the iShares Core MSCI Emerging Market ETF over the same period.\n\n\"The US is 20th out of 20,\" Citrone said, adding that gains in the US market fell around 30% short of the gains in emerging markets in the last year. \"That's a significant difference.\"\n\nThere are a few reasons Citrone said he believed the US's underperformance would continue:\n\nMost global investors are \"way overweight\" in the US-based assets. On average, US-based institutions have around 80% of their wealth invested in the US market, he said.\n\n\"Most people are going to move some money from the US, elsewhere,\" Citrone added.\n\nAI uncertainty. US markets are also facing uncertainty as to how the AI trade will pan out, he said, pointing to overarching concerns about large AI-related capex spending, though monetization plans for AI remain unclear at some firms.\n\nVarious stock sectors are also starting to sell-off out of fear over how AI could disrupt business models, he added, pointing to the selling pressure that's hammered the software, real estate, and trucking sectors recently.\n\nCitrone said he saw better opportunities in emerging markets. He pointed in particular to the promising investment climate in areas like Argentina and Brazil, and said Mexico was his top pick due to its growing ties to the US economy.\n\n\"I think Mexico has really gone all in with the United States and they've got good — better leadership, the companies are quite competitive,\" Citrone said, adding that most of the companies in the nation had \"big moats\" in competition due to being monopolies or oligopolies.\n\nInvestors have been increasingly turning their attention to other areas around the world, a trend that has been gathering steam since President Donald Trump's tariffs first sparked a \"Sell America\" moment in markets last year. Goldman Sachs and Lazard are among the firms that have also warned the US's dominance in global markets could continue to fade.",

The vast majority were based in the US.\n\nThe most targeted companies were technology stocks that had been boosted by market-wide optimism about artificial intelligence, Josh Black, the author of Diligent's report, told Business Insider. The report identified Applovin, a company that helps iPhone apps monetize users via advertising technology, as an example of a common short. The company's stock is down nearly 40% this year.\n\nThe spike in short-selling campaigns may be a sign of pain to come in 2026. In 2021, one year before a global market plunge brought on in part by concerns over lofty tech valuations, there were 128 campaigns — the most in the last five years until 2025.\n\nOf last year's 166 campaigns, 55 of them were focused on technology companies, by far the most of any sector.\n\nThe slide in software stocks such as Salesforce and Oracle this year has added fuel to short-sellers' questions about the industry's valuations in the age of AI.\n\nNew shortseller BMF Capital, run by Frankie Gerola and based in Arizona, told Diligent that one of the firm's first bets, against defense AI company BigBear.ai, came about in part due to what it viewed as a \"lack of true AI innovation.\" BigBear, which has attracted other short sellers, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the short-sellers' critiques.\n\nBMF Capital is also keeping an eye on companies \"that repeatedly change narratives in search of relevance, such as a sports company pivoting into AI dating.\"\n\n\"That kind of identity drift usually precedes capital stress or poor fundamentals,\" BMF Capital said.\n\nLast year, the average short campaign generated returns of 7.2% 30 days after launch, according to Diligent. So far in 2026, the software-stock crash has generated billions for those betting against the stocks, short-seller tracker S3 Partners said.",

Returning to Tokyo, the airline's main hub, would mean more resources for maintenance and repair.\n\nThe spokesperson added that the flight departed again on Wednesday morning, with a change of aircraft and crew.\n\nData from Flightradar24 shows the new plane departed at around 7:30 a.m. and is supposed to land in Frankfurt around 1 p.m. local time. That's about 20 hours later than passengers initially expected to get there.\n\n\"The safety of our passengers and crew is our top priority,\" the spokesperson said. \"We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused to our customers by this extensive delay.\"\n\nSince the plane turned around roughly halfway through a huge journey, it was a particularly gruelling flight to nowhere — but not the longest.\n\nLast June, a Qantas flight to Paris returned to Perth after 15 hours. It was mid-flight when Iran launched strikes against a US air base in Qatar, closing some of the world's most congested airspace.\n\nAnd in 2023, Air New Zealand passengers had a 16-hour flight to nowhere after an electrical fire in a terminal at New York's JFK Airport.",

    "fullText": "Jake Paul was a firebrand YouTuber. Then he was an NFT merchant, and a betting site operator. Now, Paul is a professional boxer — and venture capitalist. And he's learning from one of the biggest names in tech.\n\nOn \"Sourcery,\" Paul said that he met OpenAI CEO Sam Altman while sitting next to each other at President Donald Trump's inauguration.\n\n\"Sam likes fast cars, and so do I,\" Paul said. \"So, we just started talking about cars, and then we got along, and that was really it.\"\n\nPaul's Anti Fund — which is also led by his brother Logan and longtime founder Geoffrey Woo — invested in OpenAI in 2025. The biggest lesson he's learned from Altman is efficiency, Paul said.\n\nHe described the quick-and-tidy meetings that Altman runs. The OpenAI CEO \"walks into the room, sits down, let's get right into the conversation, boom boom boom,\" he said.\n\nIn 15 minutes alone, Altman was \"hella productive,\" Paul said. Then, Altman can go on to his next meeting and do it all over again.\n\n\"We'll do hourlong meetings or calls and just waste time,\" Paul said. \"I think that was inspiring because time is the most valuable thing, and it's the only reason you can't accomplish more.\"\n\nIndeed, Altman has long opted for the 15-minute meeting. In a 2018 blog post, he wrote that the ideal meeting time is either around 15 to 20 minutes or 2 hours, but \"the default of 1 hour is usually wrong.\"\n\nPaul has worked closely with OpenAI in the last year, beyond participating in fundraising.\n\nRemember all of those strange Paul memes running around the internet during the Sora 2 launch? They were by design. Paul said he helped consult on the project and was one of the first to sign over his name, image, and likeness.\n\nWoo also appeared on the podcast, and spelled out the thinking behind those far-out memes (such as an AI Paul declaring he was gay). \"It was not something that was like, 'Hey, Jake Paul is now gay.' Jake was thoughtful in terms of why we were part of that launch.\"\n\nWoo also said that he had formed a good friendship with Altman and Mark Chen, OpenAI's chief research officer.\n\nFor the Sora 2 launch, Paul said that he had \"regular calls\" with OpenAI and offered \"super detailed consulting.\"\n\n\"Me and my brother have however many years combined of social media experience since the beginning,\" Paul said. \"We were there when the term 'influencer' was even made up.\"\n\nThis background, Paul said, helped him give good advice on what OpenAI's social media-like interface should look like. He advised on both what creators and audiences wanted, he said.\n\nAnti Fund closed its $30 million fund in September. Other investments include defense tech startup Anduril and prediction market Polymarket.\n\nWoo said their ties to OpenAI remain strong. \"We were just at OpenAI for three hours looking for other ways to collaborate,\" he said. \"Things might be cooking.\"",

    "title": "BrowserPod: Universal in-browser sandbox powered by WASM (starting with Node.js)",
    "description": "BrowserPod 1.0 is live: universal in-browser code sandboxes powered by WebAssembly. Node.js available today.",
    "fullText": "Today we’re releasing BrowserPod 1.0: a browser-based code sandbox for running untrusted code next to the user, with near-native speed, extremely low latency, strong data locality and very low running costs, while maintaining high fidelity with native/cloud execution.\n\nThis first release ships with BrowserPod for Node.js, the first engine in a broader, language-agnostic platform: a universal execution layer for browser-based compute. Support for Python, Ruby, Go and Rust engines will be released in the next six months. Linux-class sandboxes, powered by CheerpX, will be added by the end of 2026.\n\nBrowserPod relies on WebAssembly to provide high-fidelity, fully compiled runtime engines for multiple languages that are robust to real-world computationally heavy, multithreaded and multiprocess loads.\n\nTo get an idea of what BrowserPod can do, feel free to experiment with the Node.js REPL below, running completely on your device.\n\nIncreasingly, software has a need to safely execute untrusted code: generated by models, written by users, pulled from libraries, or assembled by agents. That’s changing the economics and the threat model of code execution. The key question is not how to run code, but where to run it, what it can reach, and what it costs to operate at scale.\n\nCloud sandboxes are a common, default solution. But they also come with recurring tradeoffs:\n\nBrowserPod flips the model: keep execution inside the browser, leveraging WebAssembly and the browser’s security model, while still providing a Linux-compliant environment (filesystem, processes, and networking).\n\nBrowserPod is designed to be a universal compute platform, powered by multiple runtime engines, starting with Node.js, but expanding to other languages very rapidly.\n\nThis technology is the culmination of more than 10 years of unique experience that we have in building browser-based development tools and virtual machines based on WebAssembly.\n\nHere are the use cases that shaped the architecture from day one:\n\nRun AI-generated code in a sandbox next to the user, with fast startup, strong isolation, and better performance than typical cloud-based sandboxes. This is the most direct path to cutting per-session sandbox costs while tightening security boundaries and improving performance.\n\nPower “real” development workflows in the browser: package installs, dev servers, build tools, previews. All with high fidelity.\n\nTurn documentation into a runnable environment: examples people can modify, execute, and share without leaving the page.\n\nHigh-fidelity environments with minimal operational overhead. If you can avoid per-student sandboxes, you can meaningfully change what’s economically feasible.\n\nWith BrowserPod, not only can compute stay local, but user data as well, making privacy-first applications much more practical and removing any jurisdiction risk connected to shipping user information to the cloud. Paired with the already visible trend towards the on-device execution of agentic models, we envision a world in which BrowserPod can power local-only personal agentic workloads in absolute privacy.\n\nBrowserPod includes Portals, a controlled networking feature that lets you expose services running inside a Pod through shareable URLs.\n\nThat means you can run a dev server inside its sandbox and still get:\n\nAll this, without computation being delegated to backend infrastructure.\n\nTo see Portals in action, scan the QR code (below) with your mobile device. Any change to the code, will be reflected immediately to the device as well.\n\nAt its core, BrowserPod is built to be a high-fidelity, multi-language runtime environment.\n\nBrowserPod builds on our previous experience in building browser-based virtual machines, with WebVM being its spiritual predecessor. The syscall layer of WebVM, which is powerful enough to run large scale, unmodified native applications, serves as the core foundation of BrowserPod.\n\nWe started with Node.js deliberately, not as an easy first step, but because it is one of the most challenging environments to test the robustness and fidelity of BrowserPod.\n\nModern Node workloads are complex: they are package managers, build pipelines, dev servers, file watchers, and tooling ecosystems with complex dependencies, which assume a lot about the environment.\n\nShipping Node.js as the first engine forces the platform to be robust from the start, and it sets the bar for everything that follows.\n\nToday’s release of BrowserPod for Node.js is the first step of our ambitious release plan.\n\nOur roadmap includes numerous releases of new engines in the course of 2026:\n\nThroughout the year, we’ll also keep shipping continuous improvements in performance, compatibility, and developer ergonomics as we learn from real usage.\n\nIf you have any questions or ideas for us, get in touch. The whole Leaning Technologies team, myself included, is available on Discord\n\nIf you want to see what BrowserPod feels like in practice, start here: https://console.browserpod.io and follow the instructions, or simply use our npm quickstart.\n\nnpm create browserpod-quickstart\n\nWe believe BrowserPod is a concrete step toward a bigger goal: making the browser a first-class execution environment for tools, services, and the next generation of AI-native products. We cannot wait to see what the community will build with BrowserPod.",

    "description": "Allows silent MITM interception of every password manager on every Chromium browser via Unicode homoglyph path spoofing. Google: WontFix.",
    "fullText": "A critical vulnerability in the Chromium native messaging implementation allows an attacker to achieve Arbitrary Code Execution and Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) control over secure communication channels between browser extensions and desktop applications.\n\nThe attack requires only standard user-level access. No privilege escalation. No modification of existing application files. The attacker drops a single poisoned manifest into a user-writable directory.\n\nEvery application using Chrome native messaging is affected across all Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Vivaldi, Opera) on Linux and macOS. Approximately 3.5 billion browser installations are potentially exposed.\n\nThe attack targets the NativeMessagingHosts directory. Chromium reads a JSON manifest and executes the path field without applying NFKC normalization or ASCII validation.\n\nOn Linux (ext4) and macOS (APFS), these are distinct filesystem locations. A standard user can write a poisoned manifest to their local config directory, redirecting all sensitive extension traffic to an attacker-controlled binary.\n\nResult on Linux ext4: VULNERABLE!\n\nThis research was conducted entirely on a Chromebook — a device Google markets as “Secure by Default.” The browser completely abdicates its role as the trust authority by executing a path containing Greek Rho instead of Latin P without question.\n\nA second, distinct attack vector was discovered in the same research. Chrome does not normalize Unicode in extension names before displaying them on the chrome://extensions page.\n\nChrome renders both identically on the extensions management page. The victim believes they are looking at a legitimate Coinbase Wallet installed from a trusted system directory.\n\nThe working PoC extension demonstrates:\n\nBoth the native messaging attack and the extension naming attack exploit the same fundamental failure: Chromium does not normalize Unicode before displaying or executing it. The native messaging vulnerability achieves code execution. The extension naming vulnerability achieves social engineering. Together they demonstrate a systemic Unicode handling failure across multiple Chromium subsystems.\n\nThis disclosure was reported to 12 organizations between February 7–16, 2026. Their responses reveal a systemic industry failure: a chaotic mix of validation, denial, and abdication.\n\nThe vendor responses reveal a fundamental contradiction: Bitwarden and Cisco validate the risk and act on it, while Google — the root cause vendor — refuses to fix a vulnerability that their own downstream partners are scrambling to mitigate. Every downstream browser inherits this vulnerability permanently unless they mitigate independently.\n\nIn February 2019, Google published a whitepaper at the Munich Security Conference — a stage traditionally reserved for heads of state and defense ministers — titled “How Google Fights Disinformation.”\n\nThe paper outlined three pillars of their defense against disinformation:\n\nGoogle claimed that “impersonation and the misrepresentation of ownership” are harms they tackle at scale because they undermine the trust users place in their services.\n\nWhen presented with a working demonstration that their browser facilitates impersonation at the binary level — allowing a Greek character to masquerade as a Latin character and redirect execution of security-critical software — Google marked it WontFix.\n\nGoogle’s public stance (Munich, 2019): “We fight disinformation because fragmentation destroys societies.”\n\nGoogle’s technical reality (Chromium, 2026): “We allow homoglyph-spoofed paths to fragment the browser’s trust model because fixing it is outside our threat model.”\n\nWhen the technical evidence on Chromium Issue 482538021 became too heavy to carry, the conversation shifted from the vulnerability to the researcher. Vivaldi’s Security Group, operating on Google’s own infrastructure, posted:\n\n“We do not engage with AI. AI generated responses are not acceptable.”\n\nThis statement was made after the researcher had provided byte-level filesystem verification, working proof-of-concept code, intercepted 1Password traffic logs, and a detailed technical rebuttal of Vivaldi’s “physical access” framing.\n\nThe “AI” label was not a technical assessment. It was a kill switch. By labeling verified human research as bot-generated content, Vivaldi signaled to every other downstream vendor that the data was “noise.” They attacked the medium to avoid the message.\n\nThis is the ultimate proof of the Munich Hypocrisy: Google claims to fight the fragmentation of truth, yet they provide the platform for downstream partners to suppress legitimate security research using disinformation tactics.\n\nSince Google will not enforce normalization at the engine level, the responsibility falls on extension developers and system administrators.\n\nThis discovery is the direct result of building the TreeChain Polyglottal Cipher™ — an encryption architecture that operates across 133,387 Unicode characters and 202 languages. By mapping the behavior of the full Unicode space, we identified that the modern web’s trust model is built on a Visual Fallacy — the assumption that if two things look the same, they are the same.\n\nThe vulnerability and the fix came from the same research. Building encryption safely across the full Unicode space forced us to solve the exact problem that Chrome never thought about.\n\nGoogle’s 2019 Munich whitepaper was titled “The Great Puzzle: Who Will Pick Up the Pieces?”\n\nWhen a security researcher demonstrated that Chrome’s native messaging facilitates binary-level impersonation — the exact “misrepresentation of ownership” Google pledged to fight — the response was WontFix. When the evidence became undeniable, the conversation shifted to attacking the researcher. When downstream vendors asked who was responsible, Google said it was “by design.”\n\nThe fix is not complex. NFKC normalization is a single function call. Mixed-script detection is a solved problem. Binary integrity verification is standard practice. The tools exist. The knowledge exists. The only thing missing is the will to implement them.\n\nTreeChain Labs built the Polyglottal Cipher to encrypt data across 133,387 Unicode characters and 202 languages. In doing so, we solved this class of vulnerability architecturally — not as a patch, but as a foundational design principle.\n\nWhere Google sees an “infeasible” bug, TreeChain sees a call to build a system where identity is structural, not visual. We don’t just fight disinformation — we make it mathematically impossible.",

I've spoken on it before that it's a brotherly kind of rivalry.\n\n\"We played with these guys for two months over the summer and got to know them pretty well, some great fellas. To me, that adds to the challenge and the rivalry.\"\n\nGibson-Park had to content himself with a place on the replacements bench for Ireland's victory over Italy in Dublin last weekend with Munster's Craig Casey getting the nod to start.\n\nNaturally, the Leinster clubman is keen to earn his 49th Ireland cap as a starter this week but was happy to \"bring energy\" as a replacement last week.\n\nIreland have gone with a bench split of six forwards and two backs in their opening Six Nations games and with that, Gibson-Park feels it is imperative for all players to be a little more versatile, even suggesting with a smile he'd be open to a different role in the backs.\n\n\"It's something we have to be over the detail and be ready to do,\" he added.\n\n\"It's part and parcel of playing 6-2 but I'd love to get a run on the wing.\n\n\"I enjoy it and it's something I do a little bit of in training. The weeks I'm not playing with Leinster I try and get a run at full-back because ultimately, it can aid your game and give you more of an understanding, and I find it enjoyable.\"",

    "fullText": "Jess Fishlock will join Rhian Wilkinson's coaching staff for part of Wales' international camp in March before leaving to fulfil club commitments with Seattle Reign.\n\nWales legend Fishlock, 39, retired from international football in October, but signed a new one-year deal with National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) side Reign the following month.\n\nShe will join her former international team-mates as a technical assistant for Wales' opening 2027 World Cup qualifying game against the Czech Republic on Tuesday, 3 March.\n\nFishlock will not be present for the second Group B1 fixture, against Montenegro in Llanelli four days later, because of Reign's preparations for the new NWSL season, which begins later in the month.\n\n\"She's obviously in pre-season with Seattle so a big thank you to Seattle and to her coach Laura Harvey for allowing us to borrow her for the front end of this campaign,\" said Wales head coach Wilkinson.\n\n\"She's coming in as a technical assistant. I know as a former player who became a coach, it's quite a leap off a cliff. When the players have days off, you do not. Your day starts a lot earlier and ends a lot later.\n\n\"Jess is still a player for Seattle and she's just retired from the national team so she will be eased into it. In that way, it's slightly different than the other technical staff, but she will be putting in a shift for sure.\"\n\nFishlock's former team-mate Kayleigh Barton, who has been working with Wales' under-17s squad after retiring in the wake of Euro 2025, will also be involved with the senior group.\n\nFishlock has 'had conversations' over Wales role\n\nCould granddaughter of 'The King' play for Wales?\n\nWales to tour country in World Cup qualifying\n\nWales 'all in' for 2027 World Cup - Wilkinson\n\n\"These are women who have given everything for their country and as our young players come through now, I think having the support of those players around the environment is huge,\" Wilkinson added.\n\n\"Equally, Jess needs to see a little bit behind the curtain so she can make her decisions about what she might want to do in the future, if she ever retires.\"\n\nThe Czech Republic game, which will be played in Uherske Hradiste, is Wales' first competitive fixture since Euro 2025, which was the first women's major tournament the team had qualified for.\n\nWales' hopes of following their European Championship appearance by reaching a first World Cup have not been helped by the loss of Fishlock, the greatest female player in the history of the Welsh game.\n\nBut while she feels Fishlock could still contribute on the pitch, Wilkinson says she has to accept her decision to stand down from Wales duty.\n\n\"Jess is one of those players that could play for many more years and she knew that when she retired,\" Wilkinson said.\n\n\"It's painful to know that she could probably still step on the pitch, but equally I think it was a great decision that she's made when she's healthy, strong and still fully capable to be like 'OK, I want to focus on my club football at this point'.\n\n\"We had really good conversations and Jess is an all-in type person so she wouldn't say 'oh I'm good to go for another year'. In her mind if she's good to go, she's saying yes to a cycle, whether that's two or four years, and I don't think she felt like she had the energy to do that.\"\n\nWales begin their bid to reach the World Cup knowing there is no opportunity to qualify automatically because they are in League B.\n\nAssuming they do not finish bottom of a group which also includes Albania – which would be disastrous – Wales will progress to a play-off campaign in which they may have to come through stages to secure a place at the tournament, which will be held in Brazil.\n\nWilkinson has recalled fit-again Newcastle United player Lois Joel to her squad for the first two group games, but midfielder Laura Hughes misses out through injury.\n\nHughes, who has previously been capped by Australia, made her Wales debut in the friendly win over Switzerland in December.\n\nWilkinson says she does not know the exact nature of Hughes' injury, but expects her back for the double-header against Albania in April.\n\nThere are three uncapped players in the squad - goalkeeper Poppy Soper and Plymouth Argyle duo Olivia Francis and Phoebie Poole.\n\nOlivia Clark (Leicester City), Safia Middleton-Patel (Manchester United), Poppy Soper (Rugby Borough), Ceri Holland (Liverpool), Gwen Zimmerman (Eclipse Select), Ella Powell (Bristol City), Rhiannon Roberts (Sunderland), Hayley Ladd (Everton), Gemma Evans (Liverpool), Charlie Estcourt (Portsmouth), Lily Woodham (Liverpool), Esther Morgan (Bristol City), Sophie Ingle (Bristol City), Mia Ross (Charlton Athletic), Angharad James (Seattle Reign), Lois Joel (Newcastle United), Carrie Jones (IFK Norrkoping), Tianna Teisar (Plymouth Argyle – on loan from Bristol City), Mared Griffiths (Sunderland - on loan from Manchester United), Olivia Francis (Plymouth Argyle), Phoebie Poole (Plymouth Argyle), Hannah Cain (Leicester City), Rachel Rowe (Nottingham Forest), Ffion Morgan (West Ham United), Elise Hughes (Crystal Palace), Mary McAteer (Charlton Athletic).",

    "description": "Hull KR made history with a domestic treble in 2025 and now target world domination in Thursday's decider with NRL premiers Brisbane Broncos.",
    "fullText": "The sensation of winning is an addictive one.\n\nWhether it's the fizz of champagne bubbling on the tongue, the feeling of completion mixed intoxicatingly with the ecstasy of achievement, or even the monetary rewards, those who have enjoyed success crave it greedily.\n\nHull KR captain Elliot Minchella is no exception.\n\nIn 2025, Minchella got his hands on all the prizes; the first Robin since the great Roger Millward to lift a Challenge Cup, the first since David Watkinson to raise the prize for securing the top-flight championship.\n\nWinning Super League for the first time gives Rovers a crack at a trophy no Robin has ever won - the World Club Challenge.\n\nThursday's showpiece against Australia's National Rugby League premiers Brisbane Broncos will give Minchella and his team-mates the chance to box off their 2025 successes and earn the mantle of best club team in the world.\n\n\"St Helens, Leeds, Wigan and Bradford, to name just four, all won World Club Challenges and we want to remembered for winning this game,\" Minchella told BBC Sport.\n\n\"No-one remembers a team that didn't come out on the winning side. You remember the ones that won for years to come.\n\n\"That's my thought process - I want to be part of a team that wins. I experienced that last year and this is the first opportunity for 2026.\n\n\"Winning silverware felt great last year, so I want another piece of it.\"\n\nAlthough there might be some in the west of the rugby league-mad city of Hull who swap their irregular black and white hoops for maroon, white and gold on Thursday night, the World Club Challenge tends to unite many fans behind the Super League representing the northern hemisphere game.\n\nBeing standard bearers for the competition and the community is not lost on Minchella, who watched the likes of Bradford and St Helens strike a blow to the all-conquering NRL in the inter-hemisphere match-ups as a boy.\n\n\"It's unique to play against a team not in your competition, teams you're not used to if you like,\" he added.\n\n\"In Super League you get to know your opposition when you play against them two or three times a season, so this is a completely unique situation.\n\n\"It's the same for both teams; you do your homework on the opposition.\n\n\"These are games I watched as a kid, the World Club Challenges from yesteryear. You dream then of being involved in one someday, and here we are, getting the chance to play in one on Thursday.\n\n\"It's a massive privilege to be involved in this game, not just to represent the city of Hull but also Super League and going up against the NRL's best.\"\n\nHaving dominated the competition in 2025, Hull KR's start to life as champions can hardly be described as ideal preparation for the ominous meeting with NRL champions Brisbane.\n\nThe Robins let slip an 18-6 lead against newly-promoted York in their season opener to lose 19-18 and started the Super League campaign in defeat.\n\nFor head coach Willie Peters, it is a case of finding improvement and learnings, and a little inspiration, as they head into Thursday's crunch encounter with the Broncos.\n\n\"The way York handled the game, coming up against a team who had just won the treble, they showed no fear,\" he told BBC Radio Humberside.\n\n\"It didn't matter who was in front of them, they just went after them.\n\n\"We need to be the same this week against Brisbane. The Broncos are a formidable side, the best in the NRL, so it will be good to take some of York's mindset against us into the game.\"\n\nThursday, 19 February (19:30 GMT)\n\nWatch on BBC Three and BBC iPlayer; listen to commentary on BBC Radio 5 live and BBC Radio Humberside\n\nAround 24,000 fans will get the opportunity to roar on Rovers in Thursday's game, after Hull KR negotiated the use of the larger MKM Stadium, home of their fierce rivals Hull FC.\n\nCraven Park's much lower capacity would have left many fans locked out of the event, and stifled the club's ability to generate revenue from a major showpiece.\n\nSo, Minchella and his team-mates have a unique situation whereby they will head for the home dressing room rather than the away facility, as well as running out to thousands of cheering voices rather than a chorus of boos and jeers.\n\nThey will also do so in a specially designed kit, which harks back to the Robins' famous 1983 victory over a touring Queensland side which featured 'The King' Wally Lewis, later Wigan star Gene Miles and other Australia internationals such as Wally Fullerton-Smith and Bryan Niebling.\n\nThat Rovers side remains fondly recalled, with Robins forever favourites such George Fairburn, Gary Prohm, Mike Smith, John Dorahy, Watkinson, Mark Broadhurst and Phil Hogan among the ranks.\n\n\"We're looking forward to pulling the shirt on,\" Minchella added. \"I've done some pictures with the kit and heard a lot of the story, the reasons why we're wearing the shirt.\n\n\"You never forget the history is there, it's in the books forever and for us to be able to represent those guys, our club and our community wearing the shirt is a great nod to them.\n\n\"Hopefully people are proud to see us wear that and we can make them proud and make our own history as the 2026 team.\"\n\nBrisbane arrived in England for a two-week visit last week, spending the first part of their trip in London, where they linked up with namesakes London Broncos as part of legend Darren Lockyer's involvement in the capital.\n\nThe NRL champions then headed north to prepare for Thursday's match, having put together an impressive squad.\n\nRugby league's 'Justin Bieber' in the shape of dynamic full-back Reece Walsh spearheads the high-profile group, while powerful forwards such as Payne Haas and Patrick Carrigan offer the muscle to put Rovers under duress.\n\nPeters will look to Arthur Mourgue, Oli Gildart, Peta Hiku and Mikey Lewis to provide the sparkle in response to the attacking gifts of Walsh, Kotoni Staggs, Ezra Mam and Gehemat Shibasaki.\n\nTom Amone, Jai Whitbread and Dean Hadley are among the packmen who will look to get at their Broncos counterparts.\n\n\"Us as a forward pack, we look forward to going up against theirs, and most games of rugby league are won in the middle, and the backs decide by how many,\" Minchella said.\n\n\"So, it'll be no different on Thursday. We're testing ourselves against the best out there and we're looking forward to the physical battle of the game, and going after it and embracing it.\n\n\"We've got to stop them but we want to be confident in making them try to stop us too.\"\n\nHull KR became only the fifth team to win Super League in achieving their 2025 dreams, likewise in terms of securing a treble.\n\nWhile skill was at the heart of such success, mentality and mindset too are key for the Robins to continue to bring silverware to the red and white side of the River Hull.\n\n\"We've got a responsibility to put our best foot forward, we need to put together a 'British' performance, represent who we are and that's East Hull as well,\" Minchella maintained.\n\n\"It's about having some grit and some toughness, doing that to the best of our ability.\n\n\"It's something we're good at as a team and it's going to come out on the biggest stage - it needs to come out on the biggest stage.\n\n\"The conditions are going to be pretty cold, the atmosphere is going to be hostile, and for us as players we need to nail all those effort areas, be a tough team to break down and be dogged.\"",

    "fullText": "Former world number two Paula Badosa has responded to claims she is \"disrespectful to the game\" following her withdrawal from a match in Dubai.\n\nThe Spaniard beat Katerina Siniakova 6-3 7-5 at the Dubai Tennis Championships on Monday before a right thigh issue forced her to retire from the match against Elina Svitolina on Tuesday.\n\nThe 28-year-old, who retired from four matches last year, was 4-1 up against Svitolina but lost the first set 6-4 and then, having called for treatment, withdrew.\n\nA social media user accused Badosa of being \"disrespectful to the game\" as \"you cannot retire/withdraw from every tournament\".\n\n\"You have no idea what it's like to live with a chronic injury and still choose to keep going,\" wrote Badosa in response., external\n\n\"To wake up every day not knowing how your body will respond, searching for solutions, and fighting for something you love and give everything to even when it's so difficult.\"\n\nTennis 'racist, misogynistic, homophobic', says Aiava\n\nBadosa contemplated ending her playing career in 2024 because of a string of injuries, including a chronic back problem.\n\nShe was ranked as high as number two in 2022 but, despite working her way back into the top 10 last year, is now 70th.\n\n\"Trust me I'm the first one suffering with pain and having endless nightmares to try to find solutions every single day,\" she added.\n\n\"I'll always try one more time. And if there's even a 1% chance to keep going, I'll take it.\"\n\nBadosa, who reached the semi-finals of the Australian Open in January 2025, criticised the toxicity of some of social media.\n\n\"So for me the only disrespect here is to open social media and read messages like this,\" she added.\n\n\"Then we complain if we see players or people suffering and having mental health issues. But I'm not surprised with the amount of hate and 'experts' we have here.\"\n\nBadosa's comments follow Destanee Aiava announcing her impending retirement aged 25, saying it had a \"racist, misogynistic, homophobic and hostile\" culture.\n\nAs part of her explanation of her decision, Aiava said she had faced abuse from online trolls - an issue that has affected several players in the game.\n\nBritish player Katie Boulter shared some of the abuse she had received with BBC Sport last year to help highlight the scale of the problem.\n\nFigures from data science firm Signify, the International Tennis Federation and Women's Tennis Association show that in 2024, about 8,000 abusive, violent or threatening messages were sent publicly to 458 tennis players through their social media accounts, with many stemming from betting.\n\nLive scores, results and order of play\n\nGet tennis news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Emily Harrop says she was born with bindings on her feet and poles in her hands.\n\nOn Thursday, she could have a Winter Olympic medal around her neck.\n\nAs a three-time world champion in ski mountaineering, the 28-year-old is a hot favourite to be on the Milan-Cortina podium as the sport makes its Olympic debut.\n\nAnd yet, in a parallel world, it could have been the red, white and blue of the union jack flying in her honour, and not that of the French flag.\n\nBorn in the French Alps to an English mother and father, she was initially an alpine skier and was downhill British champion in 2015 - but choosing her allegiance was never given much thought.\n\n\"My dad wanted me to go with the Brits,\" Harrop told BBC World Service's More Than The Score podcast.\n\n\"I've grown up in France and all my coaches, all my training partners, it's all been through the French system. It was hard for me to turn my back on all that.\"\n\nHarrop only took up ski mountaineering - or skimo for short - as a 20-year-old after injuries veered the course of her career away from alpine skiing.\n\n\"In skimo, when I started at least, the British team didn't really exist and they weren't actually competing on the World Cup,\" she said. \"So the question [of allegiance] didn't really get asked.\"\n\nAnd Harrop has never looked back. She goes into the Olympics as a three-time world champion in the mixed relay and team events, with silver and bronze individual medals also to her name.\n\nShe has twice won the Pierra Menta - \"the Tour de France of the skimo world\" - and has four overall World Cup titles.\n\nBut what actually is ski mountaineering?\n\nIn 2021, ski mountaineering was added to the Olympic programme for the Milan-Cortina 2026 Games and will take place in the resort of Bormio in the Dolomites, though there are no athletes competing in the sport for Team GB.\n\nThe sport \"blends endurance, technical skill, and alpine adventure\", according to its governing body\n\nThree medal events will be contested - men's and women's sprint, and the mixed relay.\n\nThe sprint events consist of both an ascent and descent, with athletes sprinting uphill with skins on their skis to provide traction.\n\nThey then remove the skis, placing them in their backpack, and continue climbing on foot, before a further uphill section on skis.\n\nOnce they reach the top of the course, they remove the skins, and ski downhill to the finish line.\n\nThe average duration of a race is about three minutes.\n\nIn the mixed relay, each team consists of one male and one female athlete. On the course, there are two ascents on skis plus sections on foot, and two descents.\n\n\"It is a brutal sport,\" said Harrop. \"It's probably one of the hardest ones you have out there.\"\n\nHarrop was brought up watching British TV and has been told, by French people, that her British blood has given her \"more optimism\".\n\nBut at the time of skimo's Olympic announcement, Harrop was actually on the verge of quitting the sport.\n\n\"It was becoming too much, training and working and just trying to earn a living,\" she said.\n\n\"The fact that it became Olympic and that we had these opportunities just made life completely change. And that dream then became more of a reality.\"\n\nHarrop turned professional and joined the 'Army of Champions' - the French military's sports team which supports more than 200 top-level athletes vying for the Olympics and Paralympics.\n\nNow, Harrop - ranked sergeant - is being \"talked up\" as one of the nation's best medal hopes in Italy, an added pressure she is relishing on the eve of her Olympic bow.\n\n\"We're so lucky already to be in this generation where the Olympics have come, because there have been strong athletes before us and there will be so many strong athletes after us,\" she said.\n\n\"We're right here in this historic moment and we have the capacity to go and fight for something.\n\n\"There will be pressure, but I think you've just got to think how lucky we are to live that pressure because it means that we're holding on to something that's worth something.\"",

    "title": "The Future of Context Engineering",
    "description": "Context engineering exists because LLMs have limitations. Agentic models obsoleted prompt engineering; some future innovation will obsolete context engineering. This article maps the current limitations and identifies which innovation we need.",
    "fullText": "Early 2025, prompt engineering was the skill that separated effective AI users from the rest. Craft the perfect prompt and you'd get dramatically better outputs. Courses were launched and job postings appeared. Then, a new generation of reasoning models arrived, starting with Anthropic's Claude (perhaps already Sonnet 3.7, certainly by Opus 4) and quickly followed by others like OpenAI's GPT-5. These models could derive intent from ambiguous requests, decompose problems into subtasks, and reflect on their own outputs. The burden of elaborate prompting dropped dramatically, because the user no longer needed to compensate for what the model couldn't figure out on its own. Reasoning scaled, and a limitation shrank.\n\nContext engineering is having its moment now: AGENTS.md, skills, commands, MCPs. Courses are being launched and job postings are appearing. The pattern is familiar. The question is which limitations drive context engineering, whether those limitations will yield to further scaling, and which will require architectural innovation to overcome. This article maps those limitations and identifies what it would take to address them.\n\nIn 2019, Rich Sutton published “The Bitter Lesson”, a reflection on 70 years of AI research. His argument: general methods that leverage computation outperform hand-crafted approaches consistently. Chess, Go, speech recognition, computer vision. In each domain, clever human-designed heuristics were eventually crushed by systems that simply scaled. The lesson is “bitter” because it’s counterintuitive. We want to believe that insight beats brute force. But history says otherwise.\n\nThis maps to exponential growth. When compute grows exponentially and performance scales with compute, problems that seem hard today become trivial tomorrow. Not because we got smarter, but because we got bigger. There is however one nuance: exponential curves are actually S-curves in disguise.\n\nMoore’s law looked exponential for 60 years. But it’s now visibly slowing as we hit physical limits. What felt like endless exponential growth was the steep middle section of an S-curve. When one S-curve plateaus, progress requires an innovation, an architectural change that starts a new curve.\n\nThe Bitter Lesson describes what happens within a curve: more compute wins. But compute has limits. When scaling plateaus, a different kind of progress is needed: architectural innovation that starts the next curve. We’ve already seen this pattern play out with LLMs. Reasoning models scaled, and the user burden of elaborate prompting shrank dramatically. That was the Bitter Lesson in action: more compute outperformed the hand-crafted workarounds. The question for context engineering is: which of today’s limitations will yield to further scaling, and which will require architectural innovation to start a new curve?\n\nLLMs are neural networks, but the transformer architecture wasn’t derived from neuroscience. It emerged from engineering problems in machine translation. Next-token prediction doesn’t resemble how humans learn. These are independently evolved systems. Yet, despite completely different origins, they face similar constraints. Both have limited working memory. Both struggle to attend to everything equally. Both need mechanisms for retrieval, compression, and offloading.\n\nThe human brain is the only system we have that processes information, reasons, understands, and has addressed constraints similar to what LLMs face. If two independently evolved systems face similar constraints, those constraints are likely to be fundamental to the problem domain rather than artifacts of one particular approach. And if the constraints are fundamental, the solutions found by the older system can act as a compass for the newer one.\n\nDuring the course of evolution the brain has developed architectural innovations that let limited working memory punch far above its weight. Cognitive psychology’s information processing tradition has long modeled cognition through staged processing. Drawing on that tradition, we can organize the brain’s key mechanisms into a pipeline from input to extension:\n\nThese five mechanisms trace a pipeline from filtering input to extending cognition into the environment. The brain has many other capabilities that don’t appear as stages in this pipeline. Massive parallelism (billions of neurons firing simultaneously) is how the brain executes across all five stages, making each one fast and robust. It is not a step in the pipeline but the mode of computation underlying every step (and a powerful argument for scaling). Other capabilities operate at different levels entirely: embodiment and developmental critical periods shape how the brain develops over years, not how it processes a task; emotional regulation modulates when to switch strategies; social learning is how knowledge is acquired from others, a role that LLM pre-training already serves at massive scale. The five mechanisms are meant to act as a lens for analyzing LLMs and were selected because they map to the LLM problem space: how a system with limited working memory can process, store, retrieve, and extend information at task time.\n\nEach mechanism is independently well-established. Together they suggest a direction: the constraints LLMs face have been solved before, through architectural innovation rather than raw scaling alone.\n\nConcluding, we have two forces: scale (the Bitter Lesson: more compute, more data, more parameters) and architectural innovation (what starts the next S-curve when scaling stalls). And we have a directional precedent, the human brain, that hints at where those innovations might lead.\n\nInformation processing systems, biological and artificial, operate along three fundamental dimensions (Newell & Simon, 1972): Input (receptors), processing (a serial processor with finite speed), and memory (stores with limited capacity and persistence). For LLMs this translates to respectively the Context Window, Reasoning and Memory.\n\nEverything an LLM knows during a request must fit inside a single context window. System prompt, persistent instructions, code context, conversation history, the model’s own response: all of it competes for the same finite space. When an AI coding assistant sends a request, it’s not just your question; it’s thousands of tokens of overhead before your actual input. Every instruction consumes tokens in every request, regardless of relevance.\n\nOn the surface, this looks like it can be solved with more bandwidth. And indeed, context windows have grown from 4k to 128k to 1M+ tokens. But bigger models create a tension, illustrated by the “Lost in the Middle” phenomenon (Liu et al., 2023; Du et al., 2025). A larger context window with the same attention architecture just creates a larger middle to get lost in. Size and attention are inversely coupled: scaling one worsens the other. And even as attention improves alongside window size in newer models, the economics don’t. Sending a million tokens per request is expensive, slow, and wasteful when only a fraction is relevant to the current task. The fact that attention limitations require significant engineering effort to mitigate is itself evidence that bigger windows create new problems, even if those problems are solvable. The real bottleneck may not be whether the model can attend to everything, but whether it should have to.\n\nBut “Lost in the Middle” also reveals something important: LLMs have selective attention. It’s imperfect (biased by position rather than guided purely by relevance) but the model does attend more strongly to some parts of context than others. This is also the part of the system we can directly influence. Much of context engineering is attention management: Starting fresh conversations to clear irrelevant history, keeping prompts narrow and focused, working with subagents. These practices work precisely because the model does attend selectively and we can shape what it attends to.\n\nContext engineering is also about crafting the skills and choosing which skills to pass along in the context window. The model processes a task, recognizes a gap, and recognizes the need to invoke a skill based on what it’s currently working on. The invocation is driven by conceptual fit, without the LLM being aware of the implementation detail. It is associative retrieval in action. However, skill descriptions are injected into the context window as text: every available skill consumes tokens in every request regardless of whether it’s relevant. It is imperfect and explicit, but structurally the right pattern.\n\nThe human brain suggests as much. Humans have roughly 4 items in working memory (Cowan, 2001), though each “item” can be far richer than a token, it is absurdly small compared to even the earliest LLM context windows, yet they function effectively in complex environments. The brain’s effective capacity comes from two mechanisms working together: active maintenance scopes what’s accessible, and controlled retrieval surfaces the right knowledge from long-term memory (Unsworth & Engle, 2007). The brain didn’t evolve towards bigger working memory. It evolved sharper attention (scoping what enters the window) and better retrieval (surfacing the right content within that scope). Selective attention reduces waste within the window (don’t attend to irrelevant tokens). Associative retrieval reduces the need to pre-assemble the window correctly (let the model surface what it needs). Together, they transform the context window from a static, human-curated input into a dynamic, model-driven workspace.\n\nThis is perhaps the fastest-moving frontier. We’re seeing interactions where reasoning models don’t just latch onto the first plausible pattern, but weigh their own assumptions, checking whether a pattern spotted in one service holds across others, reading test suites to verify understanding of intent. Each improvement in reasoning enables deeper investigation, which surfaces better evidence, which produces more reliable conclusions. Within a single model, reasoning is improving fastest through scaling (longer chains of thought, more thorough self-verification) a direct instance of the Bitter Lesson, and why reasoning may not be the bottleneck that defines the next curve. Some of what appears as reasoning progress also lives in the orchestration layer: multi-agent architectures where one model critiques another, tree-of-thought search branching across parallel invocations, agentic loops decomposing tasks across separate calls. These are ways to extend the model’s reasoning externally, not the model reasoning more deeply. Here the brain parallel is collective offloading (peer review, adversarial testing, division of labor), applied to reasoning quality rather than memory.\n\nBut there’s a deeper issue: models can’t yet reliably distinguish essential complexity from accidental complexity. Essential complexity is the irreducible difficulty of your problem domain, the actual business logic. Accidental complexity is anything not inherent to the problem, arising from choice of tools, abstractions, and architecture. At its most visible, it’s framework boilerplate and configuration ceremony. At its most costly, it’s architectural decisions that make the system harder to change than the domain requires. Current LLMs treat all code as equally meaningful and may latch onto accidental patterns rather than essential ones. This is architectural: next-token prediction learns statistical regularities in code, and accidental complexity (boilerplate, configuration, framework conventions) is far more repetitive and statistically dominant in training data than essential complexity, which is unique to each domain.\n\nThere’s a second dimension to reasoning quality beyond depth: direction. LLMs exhibit a persistent tendency toward motivated reasoning, optimizing for answers that satisfy the user rather than answers that are true (Sharma et al., 2025). The model doesn’t fail to reason; it reasons competently but toward the wrong objective. This is particularly insidious because the reasoning appears sound, making the bias difficult to detect. Although self-verification can catch mistakes in how deeply the model reasons, it cannot verify the direction. Because the same bias that produces the wrong conclusion also judges the verification.\n\nThe brain has exactly this problem: confirmation bias (Nickerson, 1998) is among the most robust findings in cognitive psychology. Two independently evolved systems both exhibiting motivated reasoning suggests the tendency may be fundamental to systems that optimize under uncertainty rather than an artifact of either architecture. But unlike the other constraints in the pipeline, the brain never solved confirmation bias through internal innovation. Its solutions are almost entirely external: the scientific method, peer review, devil’s advocate. This is cognitive offloading applied not to memory but to reasoning quality. For LLMs, this maps directly to multi-agent architectures where one model critiques another, constitutional approaches where a separate process evaluates alignment, and process reward models that evaluate reasoning steps rather than outcomes. The solution may not be a single model that reasons better, but a system of models that check each other. Shared training data and architecture may reproduce the same biases rather than catch them, so this only works if the critiquing model brings genuinely different perspective. And unlike the essential-versus-accidental distinction, this limitation is the least amenable to the Bitter Lesson: more compute doesn’t fix a misaligned optimization target.\n\nThe brain addresses reasoning depth through chunking and abstraction: attending to information at the level of meaning that matters. It addresses reasoning direction through external structures: peer review, adversarial testing, institutional processes that catch what individual reasoning misses. As reasoning scales, models may get better at summarizing information at the right level of detail. But distinguishing essential from accidental complexity requires understanding intent and design rationale, and preventing confirmation bias requires input from outside the system. Both suggest secondary frontiers that pure scaling alone may not reach.\n\nCognitive science distinguishes three types of memory (Tulving, 1985). Semantic memory holds facts and patterns: how things work. Episodic memory records specific experiences: what happened, when, and why. Procedural memory encodes skills and intuitions built through repeated practice: the senior developer’s instinct that something is wrong before they can articulate why.\n\nAn LLM trained on trillions of tokens has absorbed more information than any human ever will. The Bitter Lesson applies: scaling won. Semantic and procedural memory are both encoded in the model’s weight matrices, collapsed into the same parameters rather than architecturally separated. A neural network trained on billions of lines of code doesn’t just memorize facts. Its weights encode pattern recognition, the sense for what good looks like, the ability to detect when something is off. This is how neural networks fundamentally work: repeated exposure to data consolidates into capability.\n\nEpisodic memory is architecturally absent. The training data contained millions of debugging sessions, code reviews, and architectural discussions, but the model distilled those into generalized semantic and procedural knowledge, not retrievable memories of specific experiences. It learned from episodes without forming episodic memory of them. The closest analog is the context window: a volatile, session-scoped space where specific experiences exist only for the duration of a conversation. The most pragmatic current approach to this gap is retrieval-augmented generation: external stores that surface relevant information at query time. RAG works well for semantic and episodic recall: a codebase encodes decisions and patterns, commit history records what happened and why, documentation captures rationale. Better reasoning and retrieval can surface these when relevant, and improvements here are real.\n\nBut retrieval provides information without changing how the model attends or reasons. A developer who has spent months in a codebase doesn’t just know more facts; they process new information differently. They notice anomalies faster, weigh trade-offs through the lens of accumulated context, and apply judgment shaped by experience. That shift in processing, not just in available knowledge, is the gap that retrieval cannot close. Procedural memory can be partially externalized. Rules files, linting configurations, architectural decision records, and test suites are codified experience and judgment. But these capture what to do, not the weighted judgment of when and how much. A senior developer doesn’t just follow rules; they know when to break them, which trade-offs matter more in a specific context, and what “feels off” before they can articulate why. That weighted judgment resists externalization.\n\nThe human brain learns persistently: experiences are consolidated from short-term to long-term memory, selectively and incrementally, without retraining the entire neural network. Learning carries well-documented risks: catastrophic forgetting, false memories, bias reinforcement, and selective consolidation. The brain manages it through complementary learning systems that separate fast episodic encoding from slow consolidation (McClelland, McNaughton & O’Reilly, 1995).\n\nFull retraining of an LLM is expensive, infrequent, and monolithic. But the model is not fully static once trained. Finetuning can continue training on focused datasets, modifying the model’s weights to consolidate new knowledge into lasting capability. Where RAG provides information without changing processing, finetuning changes how the model attends and reasons: the distinction between handing a developer a reference manual and that developer having internalized the domain through experience. Finetuning provides a real mechanism for consolidating experience into lasting capability without full retraining. It is currently batch rather than continuous, curated rather than experiential, and operates on the timescale of weeks rather than conversations. Each of these gaps is narrowing through engineering progress, and the challenges that remain (managing what to consolidate, preventing drift from alignment, avoiding reinforcement of bad patterns) are hard engineering problems that parallel the brain’s own imperfect consolidation.\n\nThe following diagram maps each LLM limitation to a resolution path, the brain mechanism it parallels, and whether the resolution requires scaling or architectural innovation.\n\nEach of these limitations is being actively pursued, and a representative example for each shows the direction. Do note that these resolutions all describe solutions from the LLM evolution point of view. There are many other solutions out there for these limitations, which is why we have context engineering today.\n\nThe direction for attention is decoupling window size from computational cost, so that attention can be guided by relevance rather than position. Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4.6 illustrates this in production: a 1M-token context window paired with context compaction that automatically summarizes older context during long-running tasks, and adaptive thinking that brings more focus to the most challenging parts of a task while moving quickly through straightforward parts. Rather than attending uniformly to everything in the window, the model gates what stays in working memory and allocates processing depth by relevance.\n\nThe direction for tool use is internalizing capabilities into the model itself, rather than describing them in context. Google’s FunctionGemma, a Gemma 3 variant fine-tuned specifically for function calling, illustrates this: tool use is baked into the model’s weights rather than prompted through context. Rather than competing for context space as text descriptions, tool capabilities are activated the same way the model activates learned knowledge: through its parameters.\n\nThe direction for reasoning depth is longer chains of thought and more thorough self-verification. The SWE-bench Verified leaderboard illustrates the trajectory: measuring real-world software engineering capability, it is led by Claude Opus 4 and GPT-5 above 80% resolve rates, with open-weight models close behind. This is the Bitter Lesson in action, and among the limitations listed here, reasoning depth is improving fastest.\n\nConfirmation bias is addressed most differently from the others: entirely through external structures rather than internal scaling. Approaches like Constitutional AI (e.g. in practice Anthropic’s 2026 constitution) and process reward models layer corrective evaluation around the model, checking whether outputs align with stated principles or evaluating individual reasoning steps rather than outcomes. These are architectures around the model, not improvements within it, because the same bias that produces a flawed conclusion also judges the verification.\n\nThe direction for memory is parameter-efficient adaptation approaching continuity. Standard finetuning risks catastrophic forgetting because it has no architectural separation between old and new knowledge. Parameter-efficient methods, particularly LoRA (Hu et al., 2021), change the picture by freezing pre-trained weights and learning small low-rank update matrices, typically less than 1% of the original parameters. This preserves the base model intact, makes adaptation dramatically cheaper, and enables multiple specialized adapters that can be composed or swapped at inference time. AWS’s multi-LoRA adapter serving on SageMaker shows where this leads in production: hundreds of specialized adapters dynamically loaded, swapped, and updated through a single endpoint in milliseconds, without redeployment. Models are being developed towards consolidating experience incrementally, approaching the brain’s learn-as-you-go pattern without requiring full retraining.\n\nWhat stands out is that many of the brain’s architectural innovations (selective attention, associative retrieval, chunking and abstraction, cognitive offloading, learning and offloading) can be approximated through better engineering of LLMs. Of the five limitations, confirmation bias stands out as the hardest to address. It is the only one in the diagram typed as requiring architectural innovation rather than scaling. Neither the human brain nor increased compute has produced an internal fix; both rely on external corrective structures: peer review, adversarial testing, constitutional checks. This makes it the area where context engineering will remain necessary longest, because more compute doesn’t fix reasoning towards the wrong objective.\n\nThis article mapped the limitations. Context Engineering: Should You Bother? applies this framework to current context engineering practices: which techniques address which constraints, and which will persist as models evolve.\n\nAI was used for formulation and validation. The ideas, framework, and editorial decisions are my own.",

    "description": "Two popular AES libraries (aes-js and pyaes) provide dangerous default IVs that lead to key/IV reuse vulnerabilities affecting thousands of projects. One maintainer dismissed the issue, while strongSwan’s maintainer exemplified proper security response by comprehensively fixing the vulnerability in their VPN management tool.",
    "fullText": "Two popular AES libraries, aes-js and pyaes, “helpfully” provide a default IV in their AES-CTR API, leading to a large number of key/IV reuse bugs. These bugs potentially affect thousands of downstream projects. When we shared one of these bugs with an affected vendor, strongSwan, the maintainer provided a model response for security vendors. The aes-js/pyaes maintainer, on the other hand, has taken a more… cavalier approach.\n\nTrail of Bits doesn’t usually make a point of publicly calling out specific products as unsafe. Our motto is that we don’t just fix bugs—we fix software. We do better by the world when we work to address systemic threats, not individual bugs. That’s why we work to provide static analysis tools, auditing tools, and documentation for folks looking to implement cryptographic software. When you improve systems, you improve software.\n\nBut sometimes, a single bug in a piece of software has an outsized impact on the cryptography ecosystem, and we need to address it.\n\nThis is the story of how two developers reacted to a security problem, and how their responses illustrate the difference between carelessness and craftsmanship.\n\nReusing a key/IV pair leads to serious security issues: if you encrypt two messages in CTR mode or GCM with the same key and IV, then anybody with access to the ciphertexts can recover the XOR of the plaintexts, and that’s a very bad thing. Like, “your security is going to get absolutely wrecked” bad. One of our cryptography analysts has written an excellent introduction to the topic, in case you’d like more details; it’s great reading.\n\nEven if the XOR of the plaintexts doesn’t help an attacker, it still makes the encryption very brittle: if you’re encrypting all your secrets by XORing them against a fixed mask, then recovering just one of those secrets will reveal the mask. Once you have that, you can recover all the other secrets. Maybe all your secrets will remain secure against prying eyes, but the fact remains: in the very best case, the security of all your secrets becomes no better than the security of your weakest secret.\n\nAs you might guess from the names, aes-js and pyaes are JavaScript and Python libraries that implement the AES block cipher. They’re pretty widely used: the Node.js package manager (npm) repository lists 850 aes-js dependents as of this writing, and GitHub estimates that over 700,000 repositories integrate aes-js and nearly 23,000 repositories integrate pyaes, either as direct or indirect dependencies.\n\nUnfortunately, despite their widespread adoption, aes-js and pyaes suffer from a careless mistake that creates serious security problems.\n\nWe’ll start with the biggest concern Trail of Bits identified: when instantiating AES in CTR mode, aes-js and pyaes do not require an IV. Instead, if no IV is specified, libraries will supply a default IV of 0x00000000_00000000_00000000_00000001.\n\nWorse still, the documentation provides examples of this behavior as typical behavior. For example, this comes from the pyaes README:\n\nThe first line ought to be something like aes = pyaes.AESModeOfOperationCTR(key, iv), where iv is a randomly generated value. Users who follow this example will always wind up with the same IV, making it inevitable that many (if not most) will wind up with a key/IV reuse bug in their software. Most people are looking for an easy-to-use encryption library, and what’s simpler than just passing in the key?\n\nThat apparent simplicity has led to widespread use of the “default,” creating a multitude of key/IV reuse vulnerabilities.\n\naes-js and pyaes don’t support modern cipher modes like AES-GCM and AES-GCM-SIV. In most contexts where you want to use AES, you likely want to use these modes, as they offer authentication in addition to encryption. This is no small issue: even for programs that use aes-js or pyaes with distinct key/IV pairs, AES CTR ciphertexts are still malleable: if an attacker changes the bits in the ciphertext, then the resulting bits in the plaintext will change in exactly the same way, and CTR mode doesn’t provide any way to detect this. This can allow an attacker to recover an ECDSA key by tricking the user into signing messages with a series of related keys.\n\nCipher modes like GCM and GCM-SIV prevent this by computing keyed “tags” that will fail to authenticate when the ciphertext is modified, even by a single bit. Pretty nifty feature, but support is completely absent from aes-js and pyaes.\n\nOn top of that, both aes-js and pyaes are vulnerable to side-channel attacks. Both libraries use lookup tables for the AES S-box, which enables cache-timing attacks. On top of that, there are timing issues in the PKCS7 implementation, enabling a padding oracle attack when used in CBC mode.\n\naes-js hasn’t been updated since 2018. pyaes hasn’t been touched since 2017. Since then, a number of issues have been filed against both libraries. Here are just a few examples:\n\nFinally, in 2022, an issue was filed against aes-js about the default IV problem. The developer’s response ended with the following:\n\nThe AES block cipher is a cryptographic primitive, so it’s very important to understand and use it properly, based on its application. It’s a powerful tool, and with great power, yadda, yadda, yadda. :)\n\nLook, even at the best of times, cryptography is a minefield: a space full of hidden dangers, where one wrong step can blow things up entirely. When designing tools for others, developers have a responsibility to help their users avoid foreseeable mistakes—or at the very least, to avoid making it more likely that they’ll step on such landmines. Writing off a serious concern like this with “yadda, yadda, yadda” is deeply concerning.\n\nIn November 2025, we reached out to the maintainer via email and via X, but we received no response.\n\nThe original design decision to include a default IV was a mistake, but an understandable one for somebody trying to make their library accessible to as many people as possible. And mistakes happen, especially in cryptography. The problem is what came next. When a user raised the concern, it was written off with ‘yadda, yadda, yadda.’ The landmine wasn’t removed. The documentation still suggests the best way to step on it. This is what carelessness looks like: not the initial mistake, but the choice to leave it unfixed when its danger became clear.\n\nWe identified several pieces of software impacted by the default IV behavior in pyaes and aes-js. Many of the programs we found have been deprecated, and we even found a couple of vulnerable wallets for cryptocurrencies that are no longer traded. We also picked out a large number of programs where the security impact of key/IV reuse was minimal or overshadowed by larger security concerns (for instance, there were a few programs that reused key/IV pairs, but the key was derived from a 4-digit PIN).\n\nHowever, one of the programs we found struck us as important: a VPN management suite.\n\nstrongMan is a web-based management tool for folks using the strongSwan VPN suite. It allows for credential and user management, initiation of VPN connections, and more. It’s a pretty slick piece of software; if you’re into IPsec VPNs, you should definitely give it a look.\n\nstrongMan stored PKCS#8-encoded keys in a SQLite database, encrypted with AES. As you’ve probably guessed, it used pyaes to encrypt them in CTR mode, relying on the default IV. In PKCS#8 key files, RSA private keys include both the decryption exponent and the factors of the public modulus. For the same modulus size, the factors of the modulus will “line up” to start at the same place in the private key encodings about 99.6% of the time. For a pair of 2048-bit moduli, we can use the XOR of the factors to recover the factors in a matter of seconds.\n\nEven worse, the full X.509 certificates were also encrypted using the same key/IV pair used to encrypt the private keys. Since certificates include a huge amount of predictable or easily guessable data, it’s easy to recover the keystream from the known X.509 data, and then use the recovered keystream to decrypt the private keys without resorting to any fancy XORed-factors mathematical trickery.\n\nIn short, if a hacker could recover a strongMan user’s SQLite file, they could immediately impersonate anyone whose certificates are stored in the database and even mount person-in-the-middle attacks. Obviously, this is not a great outcome.\n\nWe privately reported this issue to the strongSwan team. Tobias Brunner, the strongMan maintainer, provided an absolute model response to a security issue of this severity. He immediately created a security-fix branch and collaborated with Trail of Bits to develop stronger protection for his users. This patch has since been rolled out, and the update includes migration tools to help users update their old databases to the new format.\n\nThere were several viable approaches to fixing this issue. Adding a unique IV for each encrypted entry in the database would have allowed strongMan to keep using pyaes, and would have addressed the immediate issue. But if the code has to be changed, it may as well be updated to something modern.\n\nAfter some discussion, several changes were made to the application:\n\nOn top of all that, there are now migration scripts to allow strongMan users to seamlessly update their databases.\n\nThere will be a security advisory for strongMan issued in conjunction with this fix, outlining the nature of the problem, its severity, and the measures taken to address it. Everything will be out in the open, with full transparency for all strongMan users.\n\nWhat Tobias did in this case has a name: craftsmanship. He sweated the details, thought extensively about his decisions, and moved with careful deliberation.\n\nMistakes in cryptography are not a sin, even if they can have a serious impact. They’re simply a fact of life. As somebody once said, “cryptography is nightmare magic math that cares what color pen you use.” We’re all going to get stuff wrong if we stick around long enough to do something interesting, and there’s no reason to deride somebody for making a mistake.\n\nWhat matters—what separates carelessness from craftsmanship—is the response to a mistake. A careless developer will write off a mistake as no big deal or insist that it isn’t really a problem—yadda, yadda, yadda. A craftsman will respond by fixing what’s broken, examining their tools and processes, and doing what they can to prevent it from happening again.\n\nIn the end, only you can choose which way you go. Hopefully, you’ll choose craftsmanship.",

    "description": "Muddled selection and the lack of a plan B - how Australia's T20 World Cup campaign was derailed in Sri Lanka.",
    "fullText": "After Monday's resounding defeat by Sri Lanka took World Cup fate out of his side's hands, Australia captain Mitchell Marsh asked for the luck of the Irish to kick in.\n\nThe following day, Ireland were due to take on Zimbabwe in Pallekele. Any points for the African side would knock Australia out of the competition.\n\nClearly, no-one told Marsh that when it comes to Irish luck in a cricketing context, rain is never far away. The two sides shared the points after wet weather saw the match abandoned without a ball bowled. Zimababwe through, Australia gone.\n\nFor the first time since 2009, there will not be an Australian side in the Super 8s stage or equivalent. Since winning it in 2021, this edition marks a third consecutive T20 World Cup without Australia in the semi-finals.\n\nLess than a month on from wrapping up a resounding Ashes drubbing, Australia's T20 side has failed to hit similar heights. The failings of this competition, which has seen them play all of their group games in Sri Lanka, alongside a wider slump in this format, does little to discard the notion that T20 cricket is not a priority.\n\nAs always after a difficult tournament, selection is questioned. Steve Smith has long been out of this side, not appearing in almost two years. A century and two 50s in the recent Big Bash were not enough to earn a recall. Not until Marsh was hit in the groin in training prior to Australia's first game against Ireland.\n\nSmith was summoned to acclimatise in Colombo in case he was required. He ultimately was, but not as a replacement for Marsh.\n\nAustralia's Test run machine eventually earned a place in the squad proper when the selectors belatedly named a replacement for Josh Hazlewood, who was ruled out of the competition before a ball was bowled.\n\nAll those moving parts for a player who only made it onto the park as a sub fielder while Australia were still mathematically alive, with Smith powerless to stop Sri Lanka and Pathum Nissanka's charge.\n\nThe decision to drop Matthew Renshaw for that defeat also reads as confusing. His 37 off 33 balls against Ireland was slow, but the Ireland camp highlighted how impressed they were given the tricky nature of the pitch. Next time out, Renshaw's 65 off 44 fell short of match-winning status against Zimbabwe.\n\nDropping him against Sri Lanka backfired. After Travis Head and Marsh's opening partnership of 104 off 8.3 overs, Australia looked well set. They lost the next three wickets for 26 runs, the middle order appearing to lack the stability previously provided by Renshaw.\n\n\"The reaction back home has been rather heavy because I think we've been sold down the stream a little bit in terms of our selection and how we've gone about preparing for this T20 World Cup,\" Australia's two-time 50-over World Cup winner Matthew Hayden told Test Match Special.\n\n\"It sort of smacks of England, and their questions in the Ashes preparation - this kind of self-fulfilling prophecy of 'we're OK' and 'no, don't worry'. It's a mix of denial and maybe even just mismanagement.\n\n\"We enjoy coming to countries like Sri Lanka but we just haven't prepared for what we've seen. We've picked power hitters in finesse type conditions.\n\n\"[It's] almost like stubbornness but there is a plan A. And that plan A is called power. And it's a day and age of power. In India, that's certainly the case.\n\n\"These conditions [in Sri Lanka], though, are different. They're not such pure batting surfaces, and that requires methodology. It almost requires a bit more of an old school approach and way of thinking about the game that allows you to stay in the contest.\"\n\nAustralia's fast-bowling depth behind the big three of Hazlewood, Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc looks strong in red-ball cricket. Just ask England.\n\nIn white-ball cricket, though, it's a different story. Starc has retired from the format while Cummins and Hazelwood are injured. It says plenty that, instead of calling up a bowler immediately once the latter went down, they waited until mid-tournament to call up Smith, a batter.\n\nWord from within the camp refuses to dwell too much on muddled selection or lack of depth.\n\n\"Looking down our list, honestly, it feels like there's more than enough talent to look after the situations in the games that we're playing,\" said Marsh after the Sri Lanka defeat.\n\n\"As much as we can talk about team line-up and who's in, who's out and that sort of thing, I think if everyone just looks after their role it should help [put] us in good stead.\"\n\nAll-rounder Cameron Green, who became the Indian Premier League's most expensive overseas signing when he was picked up for more than £2m by Kolkata Knight Riders in December, was criticised by Hayden having struggled to make an impact despite batting at number three.\n\n\"Cam Green has just looked awful with the bat,\" said Hayden. \"He looks woody, he looks tinny, he looks like he's just a man with no confidence, and I'd be very surprised if that's not exactly the case.\n\n\"Matt Renshaw has come with no baggage to this tournament. He actually had a really good series back home in Australia in the ODIs. He's been a man that's been very ill treated - there's no doubt he should be in the Test team too.\"\n\nThere is a wider question on Australia's cultural attitudes towards T20.\n\nWhile Big Bash crowds are healthy, this tournament has taken place at a difficult time for fans back home to watch. Only one Australian journalist has travelled to cover the team in Sri Lanka, reflecting how editors view the levels of public interest.\n\nIn that context, it seems easy to question to what extent this competition has been prioritised. Even if injuries ruled out players such as Cummins and Hazlewood, other senior players were told to prioritise the Big Bash finals instead of heading on the warm-up tour to Pakistan prior to this week's failing.\n\n\"Cricket Australia needs to have a look at their schedule, and they need to be able to manage their number one and primary resource, which is cricket talent,\" said Hayden.\n\n\"[They need to] find a way to just be a little more controlled, and a little more destined and built towards the purpose of Australian cricket.\"\n\nBefore that, however, Australia have one match remaining in this competition, against Oman on Friday.\n\nA dead rubber, the kind of match usually more associated with England in the Ashes.\n\nMen's T20 World Cup tables, top run-scorers & wicket-takers\n\nEngland still confident despite unconvincing run - Jacks\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Eddie Howe has called on his Newcastle players to continue to \"step up\" in Bruno Guimaraes' absence - is this Jacob Ramsey's time to shine?",
    "fullText": "Jacob Ramsey once stood on the Holte End.\n\nBut the Newcastle United midfielder quickly showed where his allegiances now lie on his return to Villa Park last week.\n\nThe boyhood Aston Villa supporter jokingly kissed the Newcastle badge on his training top after spotting former team-mate Morgan Rogers warming up before their FA Cup tie.\n\nRogers could not help but smile as he repeatedly gave his close friend the thumbs down in response.\n\nIt would have been an unimaginable exchange not so long ago.\n\nRamsey was \"Villa through and through\", as one former colleague put it, and had been on the club's books since the age of six.\n\nHowever, Villa were effectively incentivised to cash in on the academy graduate for pure profit last summer after he entered the final two years of his contract.\n\nThe midfielder felt ready for a fresh start, but he understandably found those first few days at Newcastle a little strange after completing his £40m move.\n\nIt was his first permanent switch of his career.\n\nRamsey was putting on a different kit, living out of a suitcase in a hotel and based 200 miles away from his family and friends in Birmingham.\n\nBut the 24-year-old has started to truly look at home in Eddie Howe's side in recent weeks.\n\n\"It can never be underestimated how difficult it is for any player to leave a club you have been associated with for so long,\" the Newcastle head coach said.\n\nHowe will certainly need a settled Ramsey after influential captain Bruno Guimaraes was sidelined for two months with a hamstring injury.\n\nNewcastle have lost plenty of matches with Guimaraes in the team, but Howe's men have tellingly failed to win any of the 10 league games the Brazilian has missed since his debut in 2022.\n\nYet Newcastle found a way to beat top-flight opponents in the FA Cup at Villa Park without their talisman last week.\n\nIt was a night fellow midfielder Sandro Tonali scored twice in a 3-1 victory as the visitors came from behind against 10 men and channelled their frustrations following some dubious refereeing decisions.\n\nHowe said afterwards that he \"always believed there was a way without someone\" as he called on his players to continue to \"step up\" in Guimaraes' absence.\n\nRamsey will have been among those at the forefront of the manager's mind.\n\nHowe had already made it clear to Ramsey that he needed to increase his numbers - even when Guimaraes was fit - and the summer signing responded with his first goal for the club in the 2-1 victory at Tottenham last week.\n\nThe emotion came pouring out of Ramsey as he roared in front of the away end after netting what proved to be the winner just a few days before his return to Villa.\n\nEven team-mate Anthony Elanga \"celebrated like I had scored\".\n\n\"Everyone was so happy for him because he's just that type of guy who brings the energy into the team,\" he said.\n\n\"He thoroughly deserved that. His performances over the last few weeks have been outstanding.\n\n\"He held his own against Paris St-Germain and did really well. From there, he just seems to have continued to kick on.\"\n\nThat night in Paris certainly felt significant last month.\n\nNo other Newcastle player won more duels (seven) and fouls (three) than Ramsey, who had the most shots (two) in the 1-1 draw at the Parc des Princes.\n\nHe also ranked in the top two visiting players for successful passes (32) and touches in the opposition box (three) against the Champions League holders.\n\nThe fearless manner in which Ramsey demanded the ball, wriggled out of tight spaces and took his side up the pitch served as a reminder why Newcastle wanted to sign him back in August.\n\nBut it was always going to take time for Ramsey to cement his place in the most stacked area of the team.\n\nNot only did Ramsey arrive after the season had started - he then went on to sustain an ankle injury on his full debut against Leeds United, which kept him out for six weeks.\n\nThe midfielder was left playing catch-up as he adjusted to the intensity, detail and structure of life under Howe.\n\nThough Villa boss Unai Emery is a demanding figure in his own right, Howe's sapping training sessions took a little while to get used to at first.\n\nBut there have not been enough of them in recent months because of the relentless nature of Newcastle's fixture schedule.\n\nRamsey has instead come to rely on analysis debriefs to learn the intricacies of his role - after previously playing on the left under Emery - and the summer arrival has mainly built up an understanding with his team-mates through games.\n\nThis \"conscientious\" figure has impressed Howe with his work behind the scenes while Ramsey feels Newcastle's aggressive playing style will ultimately bring out the best in him in his favoured position in the middle of the park.\n\nRamsey previously noted how many players improved under Howe after sitting down with those closest to him last summer to assess which of his suitors gave him the best chance of one day getting into the England squad.\n\nThe wait for a senior call-up goes on, but Howe hopes Ramsey's first goal for the club proves a \"turning point\" in his Newcastle career as his side now prepare to face Qarabag for a place in the Champions League last 16.\n\n\"There's nothing better than actually contributing and helping your team win a game,\" he added.\n\n\"There's no better way to feel part of the Newcastle family than that.\"\n\nLatest Newcastle news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Newcastle - what do you want to know?\n\nWhy can't Newcastle win without Guimaraes?",

    "description": "You do not need to look far to find people proclaiming that VAR works fine outside the Premier League. BBC Sport spoke to people across Europe's top leagues to find out.",
    "fullText": "\"I believe we forgot the reason why VAR was introduced,\" Uefa referees' chief Roberto Rosetti said last week.\n\nHis choice of words was important. This was not a criticism of the Premier League.\n\nIt was aimed across Europe. And it was about the rise of \"microscopic\" video assistant referee interventions.\n\nIn England the media coverage of refereeing is savage. Any perceived mistake is pounced upon.\n\nSocial media is full of people saying VAR works fine elsewhere, that the standard of refereeing is better in other top divisions.\n\nIn the Premier League, are we largely cocooned from much of the controversy in the other top European leagues? BBC Sport spoke to people across the leagues to find out.\n\nBundesliga fans have been relentlessly against VAR from day one.\n\nMany terraces have 'Videobeweis abschaffen' (Eliminate VAR) banners held up in the ultras section for the duration of each review.\n\nFor all the controversy of VAR in the Premier League, it is rare to see this type of big public display. Chants yes, but not banners.\n\nIn Germany it is different. Take Augsburg fans before their fixture against Heidenheim on Sunday.\n\nBehind the goal there was a sea of messages against VAR.\n\n\"Football with VAR is like horse racing with donkeys,\" read one banner, following a penalty they had conceded against Mainz which VAR did not cancel.\n\nBBC Sport has been provided with the most up to date official data from the German top flight.\n\nIt showed that the rate of interventions is higher in Germany, but the frequency of mistakes virtually identical. That is one every 16 games in England, and 15.66 in Germany.\n\nThe numbers are collated internally, with only the Premier League having an independent body to judge performance.\n\nVAR swamps the media coverage in Germany too, with the nation's football association (DFB) trying several tactics.\n\nOnly last weekend the head of referees, Knut Kircher, sat in the TV studio throughout Saturday's matches to try to offer perspective.\n\nIt was the equivalent of Howard Webb, referees' boss at Professional Game Match Officials (PGMO), appearing on Final Score.\n\nThe DFB felt it was positive but Munich-based newspaper Suddeutsche wrote that Kircher should \"focus on improving referee performance\".\n\n\"VAR has caused a lot of unrest here,\" NTV journalist Stephan Uersfeld told BBC Sport.\n\n\"It continues to be what we call 'Schuldverschiebung' - passing on the blame - to the VAR instead of the on-field decisions.\n\n\"While it brings some fairness to the game, it has become a bureaucrat's dream.\"\n\nThe Bundesliga introduced semi-automated offside this season but its microscopic decisions and unreliability have only increased the controversy.\n\nIn January, broadcaster ZDF polled coaches, external in the top two divisions. Of the 27 respondents, 16 said they were unsatisfied by VAR.\n\nAnother survey carried out by NTV, external found that 80% of coaches felt VAR delays were excessively long. The opinion was that VAR has not improved.\n\nIf Premier League fans thought VAR had a better reputation in Germany, that clearly is not the case.\n\nIn Spain you won't see any great public displays of dissatisfaction in the stands. The league has plenty of other problems with officiating.\n\nLast summer, the Spanish FA replaced its entire refereeing committee and became the first major league to separate the roles completely.\n\nA team of 15 dedicated VARs work only as a video assistant.\n\nYet it didn't take long for the first error to happen, and again the semi-automated technology was at fault.\n\nIt failed to identify a goalscorer was offside, the officials did not realise and the goal counted. The VAR team was stood down from its next appointments.\n\nSpecialist VARs have long since been suggested as the big fix.\n\nBut BBC Sport columnist Guillem Balague says it has made no difference.\n\n\"There is no agreement of what VAR should do or how referees should act,\" Balague said. \"The suggestion was to use VAR less. Less than what?\n\n\"Why less if it is necessary? But when is it necessary?\"\n\nIt is the question that nobody appears able to answer, in any league.\n\nReal Madrid's TV channel produces videos criticising referees on a weekly basis.\n\nAt the weekend, Barcelona issued a statement, external highlighting \"repeated refereeing decisions it considers damaging to the game\".\n\nIt followed an incredible eight-minute VAR review to disallow a goal for offside against Atletico Madrid. Again, the semi-automated technology was faulty.\n\nMarca analysed, external incidents covered in the league's version of 'Match Officials Mic'd Up'.\n\nIt found 10 errors in the first 18 rounds of games - higher than the Bundesliga or the Premier League. The paper said that there would further errors not covered by the programme.\n\n\"The feeling is that VAR has complicated the game, instead of purifying it,\" Balague added. \"What was meant to simplify decisions, scientific, transparent, logical has instead made them more obscure, interpretative, anything but clear.\n\n\"Supporters in Spain often leave stadiums not just disagreeing with decisions, but also confused by them.\n\n\"The technology feels distant from the emotion of the sport.\"\n\nSerie A is in a unique position.\n\nPlayers, coaches and the media complain just as fiercely as their Premier League counterparts.\n\nDavide Chinellato, the UK correspondent for La Gazzetta dello Sport, says there is one subtle difference. Serie A not only wants VAR, it \"would prefer more intervention rather than less\".\n\n\"Unlike in England, the average Italian fan cannot imagine modern football without it,\" Chinellato told BBC Sport.\n\nThe league is backing reviewing corners and second yellow cards, which is set to be approved by the International Football Association Board on 28 February.\n\n\"What is changing is the level of frustration,\" Chinellato said. \"The expectation in Italy is that every clear mistake should be corrected.\n\n\"When that does not happen, the reaction is not to question VAR itself, but to question the rules governing its use.\"\n\nTake Lazio supporters last month after the club suffered from a couple of errors.\n\n\"Transparency on VAR, audio justifications without logic or sense,\" a banner read.\n\n\"They invent everything to ruin old-fashioned football.\"\n\nThere are similar opinions from players.\n\nVeteran Napoli defender Juan Jesus hit out at current VAR standards., external\n\nHe said: \"There's nothing but controversy. It becomes hard for everyone to remain passionate about football.\"\n\nItaly might like VAR, but difficult and technical decisions are problematic.\n\n\"Fans and media are increasingly impatient with what they see as excessive complexity,\" Chinellato added. \"They want broader, clearer, more straightforward guidelines.\n\n\"A system that aligns more closely with the basic expectation that obvious mistakes should be corrected.\"\n\nNo one has been able to define an obvious error.\n\nIn France, the story is different.\n\nLigue 1 has the highest intervention rate, pretty much every other game.\n\nAcross the first 198 matches there were 83 VAR interventions. The referee has stuck with his decision nine times, far more than any other league.\n\nFrance suffers more errors, 17. That is one every 11.65 games compared to 16 in England.\n\nThere is frustration for supporters, but most of the noise comes from the boardroom.\n\nIt is compounded by the collapse of TV rights. It means budgets have been squeezed.\n\n\"The referee system, including VAR, is costing 25m euros by season,\" L'Equipe journalist Pierre-Etienne Minonzio told BBC Sport.\n\n\"So in a time when all the clubs need money, they think it's too expensive.\"\n\nLuc Hagege, who writes about refereeing for L'Equipe, says there is a \"misunderstanding between the objective of VAR and the perception of some players, coaches, but mostly presidents\".\n\nOne of the most outspoken critics has been Lille president Olivier Letang, who says there is a \"a breakdown of trust\" with referees.\n\n\"The perception is that coaches feel a kind of arrogance from referees,\" Hagege added.\n\n\"Most people, and especially the directors, feel that a gap is growing.\"\n\nMany other figures within clubs have been critical.\n\nLyon captain Corentin Tolisso said in November: \"There are mistakes every weekend. We're paying a very high price for the level of refereeing.\"\n\nHagege said errors are magnified by the clubs and the media.\n\n\"We speak much more of the mistakes than of all the things that have been corrected,\" he added.\n\n\"A few even said that they are fed up with the VAR, we should withdraw it.\"\n\nPerhaps there is one factor which binds all five leagues.\n\nAs Rosetti said, fans and pundits asking \"where is VAR?\"\n\nIt appears to have created a gradual creep into more areas of the game.

    "fullText": "Would it surprise you to know that Team GB's curlers are full-time?\n\nThat they train 12 months a year, with only a couple of weeks holiday during the summer? That they are actually on the ice 44 weeks a year?\n\nThat they lift weights like sprinters, strategise like chess players, and fuel like Tour de France cyclists?\n\nIt's now 24 years since Rhona Martin delivered the 'Stone of Destiny' in Salt Lake City - watched by millions of rapt viewers in the early hours UK-time - to win Winter Olympic gold for Great Britain.\n\nThe nation's first Games gold in 18 years had been won by what was dismissively - and erroneously - described at the time as a group of Scottish housewives in an odd little sport.\n\nIt sparked a curiosity in curling that spikes for a couple of weeks every four years.\n\nBut aside from that window into their world, little is known about what they do for the remaining three years and 11 months of an Olympic cycle.\n\nHow Team GB is leading the way in curling's arms race\n\nSwearing, illicit filming & rule changes - what next in curling cheating row?\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nThe 10 Scottish curlers who are representing Team GB in Cortina right now are professional athletes.\n\nFrom the start of July until the end of April - when they are not at a competition somewhere in the world - they will report to the National Curling Academy in Stirling every weekday morning to start training at 08:00.\n\nEach day includes two two-hour ice sessions and one in the gym.\n\nAcross a week, three of those gym stints are strength-based and two conditioning. Most athletes will add another at the weekend, just to keep themselves right.\n\nThey are supervised - no sitting on a bench next to the weights while doomscrolling for this lot - and are specifically designed with curling in mind.\n\n\"It's Olympic lifts we're doing - clean and jerk, snatches, squats, the lot,\" says men's lead Hammy McMillan. \"And we're using ski machines, rowers, and assault bikes to really condition our bodies.\"\n\n\"The numbers we put up, I don't think people would expect them,\" adds Bobby Lammie, who is credited alongside McMillan as having changed the physicality expected of sweepers.\n\n\"It's allowed us to separate ourselves slightly from the rest of the world.\"\n\nSimilar can be said of the women's game, where 2022 gold medallist Jen Dodds - one of the world's best with a brush - is lifting just as much as some of the men.\n\n\"More than me, to be fair,\" admits men's vice-skip Grant Hardie.\n\n\"Jen is incredible in the gym,\" adds Team GB women's skip Rebecca Morrison, who takes a slightly different view of the physical work.\n\n\"You need a lot of core strength to even stay upright on the ice,\" she says.\n\n\"Maybe we're not flinging ourselves off massive jumps or sliding down a track at 80 miles per hour, but it's a lot harder than people realise to even keep your balance.\"\n\nAdd in tactical and analysis sessions, meetings with sports psychologist and nutritionists, and physio, and the days quickly become filled.\n\nIn May and June, most of those demands disappear, but the strength and conditioning work continues every weekday morning.\n\nAt some point during that spell, a couple of weeks are permitted for a holiday, but then the curlers are back at it.\n\n\"It's a full-time, all-year round job,\" says BBC Sport pundit Vicky Wright, who won Olympic women's gold in Beijing four years ago and is married to head coach Greg Drummond.\n\n\"May and June are supposed to be your recovery time - and you get a break at some point during those months - but you never have an actual holiday from it. You're curling 44 weeks a year, easily.\"\n\nThe curlers will be given an annual Athlete Performance Award (APA) by UK Sport.\n\nThat will be in one of five tiers so the more pedigree you have, the more money you will be given.\n\nWright recalls that, when she was in the Olympic cycle for the Beijing Games, she still had to work one day a week as a nurse to supplement her APA enough to get a mortgage.\n\nNone of those in Italy this month are in that position, but some pick up some coaching on the side, while others such as Hardie and Sophie Sinclair have an involvement in their family's engineering and farming businesses, respectively.\n\nAdd in prize money from the Grand Slam Tour, World Tour and assorted European events - which tends to be capped at around £40,000 per team - plus the odd little bit of sponsorship, and the income starts to go up.\n\nBut let's be clear - none of these curlers are living in luxury, never mind making life-changing money.\n\n\"It's fine if you're at the top and winning slams week in, week out,\" Wright adds. \"But if you're not... I'm not saying it's not worth it, but it's difficult.\"\n\nBruce Mouat's British men's rink - who won silver at the Olympics four years ago and went into these Games as world champions and gold medal favourites - are in a better position than most.\n\nTheir success on the ice has bolstered their APAs, and they opted to employ a management company last year to enhance their prospects away from curling.\n\nNow, they have some commercial partners, as well as doing appearances at events as diverse as the Royal Highland Show and corporate away days.\n\nMouat has been known to speak to companies about LGBT issues and inclusivity, while Hardie will soon do a talk about the importance of science, technology, engineering and maths in schools.\n\n\"But the boys are definitely not making a fortune,\" said someone close to the team.\n\nThis article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nAre players allowed to fight in Olympic ice hockey?\n\nWhy do we rarely see world records at the Winter Olympics?\n\nWhich country is the most successful at the Winter Olympics?",

She can’t wait to greet him each and every day. Sadly, the cow isn’t always in the mood for his mama’s shenanigans. Which was exactly the case in the clip.\n\nIf you saw this big baby in your barn, wouldn’t you want to go right in for a hug? Dawson was so ready for her morning cuddles with her cow, but it doesn't seem like he's a morning person.\n\n“Cuddles!” the woman cheered as she walked into the cow’s stall. “Good morning!” she added.\n\nThe woman was clearly full of energy for the day, while her bull just wanted to be left alone. After his mama tackled him with love, the animal slowly got up and tried to move away from her. Ugh, guess that’s a no on snuggles then, huh?\n\n“All I wanted was a cuddle,” the woman joked in the caption.\n\nYou could practically see the cow rolling his eyes at his mama. It had so many people online laughing.\n\n“And she’s back… again,” joked one commenter.\n\n“You can actually see his sigh and huffs the moment he hears you!!! ‘Awww shoot, here we go again with the cuddles!’ lol,” another person teased.\n\n“Man, I don’t want no cuddles today,” chimed in another commenter.\n\n“He was like ‘great here we go again,’” someone else quipped.\n\nWhile this big guy might not be solid proof that cows are affectionate, the truth is that many of them are! Cows can have friendships with both other cows and humans, and they’re very loving when they do.\n\nCows love scratches from their humans — they’ll even take a pet or two!

    "description": "In our 3D space, elementary particles neatly filter into either bosons or fermions. But in lower dimensions, that distinction gets a bit murky.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when reading this story:\n\nIn three-dimensional particle physics, elementary particles divide nicely into fermions and bosons. But in lower-dimensions, things aren’t so clear cut.\n\nThese dimensions host a “third kingdom” of quasiparticles known as anyons, which have properties that sit between the quantum description of fermions and boson.\n\nIn 2020, scientists found the experimental existence of an anyon in two-dimensional space, and in two new studies, scientists describe the existence of tunable anyons in one-dimensional space (and describe their properties).\n\nWhen you drill down into the very fabric of reality—where elementary particles make up the matter that is you and me and everything around us in three-dimensional space—things get divided nicely into two categories: fermions and bosons. These two categories of particles are defined primarily by their atomic spin (in quantum mechanical terms), with bosons (photons, gluons, Higgs boson, W bosons, and Z bosons) having integer spin values and fermions (protons, neutrons, electrons, neutrinos) having half-integer spin values. While two bosons can occupy the same quantum state (which is why photons can pass through each other), two fermions can not—a good thing, since if they could, you’d fall through the floor right now.\n\nBut as is true of most things in science, things don’t always line up so neatly. For example, for half a century, scientists have known about the anyon, which exists in two-dimensional space. This quasiparticle is essentially anything between a boson and a fermion, which explains why American physicist Frank Wilczek named them “any-ons,” or simply anyons. However, it wasn’t until 2020 that these weird particles were observed experimentally in one-atom thick (two-dimensional) semiconductors. “We had bosons and fermions, and now we’ve got this third kingdom,” Wilczek said at the time. “It’s absolutely a milestone.”\n\nNow, scientists from the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST) and the University of Oklahoma report the existence of a one-dimensional system in which anyons can exist. In two separate papers—both published in the journal Physical Review A—the researchers describe the recipe for adjustable anyons and their theoretical properties, exploring a new corner of this “third kingdom” of elementary particles.\n\n“Every particle in our universe seems to fit strictly into two categories: bosonic or fermionic. Why are there no others?” Thomas Busch, a co-author of both studies from OIST, said in a press statement. “With these works, we’ve now opened the door to improving our understanding of the fundamental properties of the quantum world and it’s very exciting to see where theoretical and experimental physics take us from here.”\n\nAnyons only exist in lower dimensions because, to put it very simply, particles in those dimensions have fewer options for moving around. Raúl Hidalgo-Sacoton (a Ph.D. student at OIST) describes the “exchange factor” that exists in 3D space—the property demanding that when two electrons swap places, they must obey a simple rule governing the mathematical statistics of the event: Its square must be equal to 1, meaning that all particles are either -1 (fermions) or 1 (bosons).\n\nIn two dimensions, however, it’s not so simple: “To satisfy the law of indistinguishability, we need exchange factors over a continuous range to account for the exchange, dependent on the exact twists and turns of the paths,” Hidalgo-Sacoto said in a press statement. And whatever lies in that range between -1 and 1 is considered an anyon.\n\nIn this study, Busch, Hidalgo-Sacoto, and their colleague Doerte Blume (from the University of Oklahoma) found that this boson-fermion binary remains broken in one dimension, and they even discovered a method to specifically tune the exchange factor. Because of their limited movement in one dimension, particles must pass through each other, and this causes the exchange factor to differ from higher dimensions. This is likely connected to the strength of the short-range interaction between the particles.\n\n“We’ve identified not only the possibility of existence of one-dimensional anyons, but we’ve also shown how their exchange statistics can be mapped,” Busch said in a press statement. “We’re thrilled to see what future discoveries are made in this area, and what it can tell us about the fundamental physics of our universe.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "A trail camera recently picked up footage of a small Australian marsupial that no one had seen in over 80 years.\n\nAs the Dodo reported, the camera captured images of a northern quoll in the Piccaninny Plains Wildlife Sanctuary in Australia.\n\nCurrently listed as endangered, Northern quolls have long tails and white spots. Their numbers have dwindled in recent decades due to habitat loss and feral predators.\n\nBased on a hunch that they might still exist in the wilderness, the sanctuary's manager, Nick Stock, set up a trail camera. It picked up movement from a northern quoll within just days.\n\n\"It was a fantastic surprise!\" said Dr. Helena Stokes from the Australian Wildlife Conservancy. \"After years of no sightings, to finally confirm a northern quoll on the sanctuary is hugely uplifting for our team.\"\n\nThe conservancy posted about the endangered northern quoll sighting on Instagram and wrote, \"It's an exciting sign that targeted, science-led conservation is helping keep one of Australia's most threatened marsupials hanging on.\"\n\nThis wildlife sighting in Australia is encouraging because it demonstrates the value of trail cameras in monitoring endangered species populations and supporting conservation efforts. These sightings offer small reminders of why it's crucial to keep searching for rare species and protecting the lands they need to thrive.\n\nOther trail cameras around the world have picked up images and videos of elusive species, including the Canada lynx, Allegheny woodrat, and Javan rhinoceros.\n\nThese stories are wonderfully uplifting and give us hope that our planet's beautiful creatures can survive and thrive despite changing climate conditions and harmful human activity. Even the smallest and most seemingly insignificant creatures play important roles in regulating plant and animal populations and balancing natural ecosystems.\n\nIn response to the conservancy's Instagram post, one social media user commented, \"Remarkable capture!\"\n\n\"So awesome!!\" someone else wrote.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Bitcoin has the potential to double in value this year. Here's why.",
    "fullText": "With Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) currently trading for less than $70,000, it might seem inconceivable that it could more than double in value to hit a price of $150,000 this year. Yet, that's exactly what some top Wall Street firms are now predicting.\n\nSo what are some of the catalysts that could send Bitcoin soaring this year? Let's take a closer look.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nRight now, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is sitting near all-time lows. It currently reads 13 out of a possible 100, indicating extreme fear.\n\nYou can interpret that ultra-low reading in one of two ways. It could be a clear red flag that something is deeply wrong with Bitcoin. Or, if you're an eternal optimist, it could be a sign of total investor capitulation. It can't get any worse than it is right now.\n\nFrom my perspective, there are a number of factors that could result in a positive shift in market sentiment. Any signal of further interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve could trigger a new risk-on mentality, leading to an inflow of new money into crypto and Bitcoin. The passage of new pending crypto legislation later this year, too, could help to reverse the tide on market sentiment.\n\nAnother way to think about the current Bitcoin situation is in terms of money on the sidelines. In other words, there's money just waiting to flow into Bitcoin, but investors are hesitant to do so right now given the terrible market sentiment. After all, Bitcoin is down more than 20% to start the year.\n\nOne way to quantify this is by looking at how much money is currently sitting in stablecoins, which are essentially digital dollars. In a risk-off environment, money flows into stablecoins for safekeeping. In a risk-on environment, money flows out of stablecoins and into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe metric that many investors are focused on right now compares the market cap of Tether (CRYPTO: USDT), the world's largest stablecoin, to the total market cap of the crypto market. If this metric is in the 8% to 10% range, then money is waiting patiently, ready to be deployed. Right now, the ratio sits at 8%. That leads me to think that money is being held back and is set to flow into Bitcoin.\n\nAnother factor that could send Bitcoin higher is a higher allocation to crypto from institutional investors. Historically, their allocation to crypto has been minimal, given the perceived riskiness of the crypto asset class.",

    "description": "North Carolina's election board reached a settlement allowing 73,000 voters to keep registration status after a GOP lawsuit challenged voter rolls.",
    "fullText": "North Carolina's elections board came to an agreement with the Republican and Democratic parties on Monday to give 73,000 voters more time to update their voter registrations before they are removed from voter rolls.\n\nThe settlement concludes an extended legal battle that rose after the Republican National Committee and North Carolina GOP sued state election officials in 2024, claiming that roughly 250,000 voters had been improperly registered. The voters in question did not provide the last four digits of their Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers or an attestation that they had neither on their registrations.\n\nRepublicans had requested that the voters be removed from rolls and their votes in the 2024 elections be thrown out. The Democratic National Committee hailed the settlement as a win on Monday, accusing the GOP of voter suppression.\n\n\"This latest victory is a win for Americans and yet another blow to the Republicans’ scheme to disenfranchise voters ahead of the midterm elections,\" DNC chair Ken Martin said in a statement after the settlement.\n\nTom Emmer Blasts Democrats' Double Standard On Save Act: 'They Require Photo Ids' At Their Own Dnc\n\nThe North Carolina State Board of Elections admitted that roughly 100,000 voters lacked proper identification as of last summer. As of December, that number had shrunk to roughly 73,000.\n\nMonday's agreement allows those voters to stay on the voter rolls, with their information to be updated when they cast a ballot. North Carolina law requires voters to show ID when voting.\n\nThe settlement comes amid a federal battle over voter ID requirements, with the GOP pushing the Safeguarding American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) America Act, which passed the House last week and is expected to face a vote in the Senate. The bill would impose a blanket requirement for voters to provide proof of citizenship before casting a ballot.\n\nKey House Committee Advances Nationwide Voter Id Bill, Setting Up 2026 Election Fight\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., vowed Sunday that Senate Democrats will block the effort.\n\n\"We will not let it pass in the Senate,\" Schumer told CNN’s Jake Tapper. \"We are fighting it tooth and nail. It's an outrageous proposal that is, you know, that shows the sort of political bias of the MAGA right. They don't want poor people to vote. They don't want people of color to vote because they often don't vote for them.\"\n\nSchumer’s comments came after Tapper pressed him on his opposition, noting that polling shows roughly 83% of Americans support some form of voter identification. That figure comes from a Pew Research poll published last year that found 71% of Democratic voters surveyed supported presenting an ID to vote.\n\nCollins Boosts Republican Voter Id Effort, But Won’t Scrap Filibuster\n\nIn addition to ID requirements, the GOP-backed bill would establish a system for state election officials to share information with federal authorities to verify voter rolls.

    "description": "A senior U.S. official on Tuesday revealed what he said were new details of an underground nuclear test blast that China allegedly conducted in June",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Feb 17 (Reuters) - A senior U.S. official on Tuesday revealed what he said were new details of an underground nuclear test blast that China allegedly conducted in June 2020.\n\nAssistant Secretary of State Christopher Yeaw told an event at the Hudson Institute ‌think tank in Washington that a remote seismic station in Kazakhstan measured an \"explosion\" of magnitude 2.75 located 450 miles (720 km) away at the Lop ‌Nor test grounds in western China on June 22, 2020.\n\n\"I’ve looked at additional data since then. There is very little possibility I would say that it is anything but an explosion, a singular ​explosion,\" said Yeaw, adding that the data were not consistent with mining blasts.\n\n\"It’s also entirely not consistent with an earthquake,\" said Yeaw, a former intelligence analyst and defense official who holds a doctorate in nuclear engineering. \"It is ... what you would expect with a nuclear explosive test.\"\n\nThe Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization, which is charged with detecting nuclear test explosions, said that there was insufficient data to confirm Yeaw's allegation with confidence.\n\nA spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington said the allegation about China conducting ‌a nuclear test was \"entirely unfounded\" and an attempt \"to fabricate ⁠excuses for resuming\" U.S. nuclear testing.\n\n\"This is political manipulation aimed at pursuing nuclear hegemony and evading its own nuclear disarmament responsibilities,\" Chinese embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said in an emailed statement.\n\n\"China urges the U.S. to reaffirm the five nuclear-weapon states' commitment on ⁠refraining from nuclear tests, uphold the global consensus against nuclear tests, and take concrete steps to safeguard the international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime,\" Liu added.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump is pressing China to join the U.S. and Russia in negotiating a replacement pact to New START, the last U.S.-Russia strategic nuclear arms limitation agreement, which expired on February 5.\n\nThe treaty's ​expiration ​has fueled concerns that the world is on the verge of an accelerated nuclear arms ​race.\n\nChina, which has signed but not ratified ‌the 1996 international treaty banning nuclear testing, denied setting off an underground nuclear test blast after the U.S. first leveled the allegation at an international conference earlier this month. China’s last official underground test took place in 1996.\n\nThe PS23 seismic station in Kazakhstan is part of a globe-spanning monitoring system operated by the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO).\n\nThe organization's executive secretary, Robert Floyd, said in a statement that the PS23 station recorded “two very small seismic events” spaced 12 seconds apart on June 22, 2020.\n\nThe CTBTO’s monitoring system can detect \"events\" consistent with nuclear test explosions with yields of 551 tons (500 metric tons) of TNT or greater, he said.\n\n\"These two ‌events were far below that level. As a result, with this data alone, it is ​not possible to assess the cause of these events with confidence,\" Floyd said.\n\nYeaw said that China ​tried to conceal the test by using a method known as ​decoupling, in which the device is detonated inside a large underground chamber to reduce the magnitude of the shockwaves it sends ‌through the surrounding rock.\n\nLike China, the U.S. has signed but not ​ratified the test ban. Under international law, ​both countries are obligated to uphold the pact.\n\nThe U.S. conducted its last underground nuclear test in 1992 and has been relying on a multibillion-dollar program that uses advanced tools and supercomputer simulations to ensure its nuclear warheads work properly.\n\nChina has rejected Trump’s call to negotiate a three-way treaty ​to replace New START, contending that its strategic nuclear arsenal ‌is dwarfed by those of Washington and Moscow, the world’s largest nuclear powers.\n\nThe Pentagon says China now has more than 600 operational ​warheads and is conducting a major expansion of its strategic nuclear force. It projects that China will field more than 1,000 warheads by ​2030.",

    "fullText": "For eight years, President Barack Obama's aides marveled that no amount of mockery, dismissal or scandal could make Donald Trump go away.\n\nTheir bewilderment is threaded through hundreds of interviews with administration officials released Tuesday in a far-reaching oral history of the Obama presidency. Throughout, Obama's advisers — some of the nation’s most accomplished political and policy experts — described their ongoing education about an electorate increasingly influenced by whatever the nascent social media told them.\n\nOver two terms in the White House, they got glimpses of a future in which conspiracy theories, such as the lie that Obama was born outside the United States, survived online. What they missed, right up to Election Night 2016, was Trump's political resilience and his understanding that alienated Americans could vote for a man the White House considered a “clown.”\n\n“He's done,” David Simas, Obama's White House political director, recalls telling the president. It was October 2016, five weeks before Election Day, and Simas had just handed his phone to Obama to watch the explosive news of Trump's “Access Hollywood” recording. Fast-forward to hours before voters went to the polls. Simas recognized Democrat Hillary Clinton's lead had shrunk to perhaps three points. “She’s fine,” he recalls thinking. “That’s the night before.”\n\nTrump defeated Clinton in the Electoral College by 306 to Clinton's 232 but lost the popular vote, an outcome long known to have stunned and devastated Democrats. But the interviews filled in the degree to which aides, pollsters and news outlets disregarded the prospect of a Trump victory even as Americans increasingly distrusted government and established political figures.\n\n“Not many people even expected that he had a chance to win,” said former White House press secretary Josh Earnest. “It was hard not to take it personally, because Trump’s candidacy, the essence of his being, and everything that he stood for, and everything about the way that he carried himself, and everything that he championed, and his rhetoric, his campaign tactics— all were anathema to everything that the Obama campaign and the Obama era, the Obama administration, had been about.”\n\nAcross the Obama Presidency Oral History project's interviews with 450 people, his advisers said that Trump rebuked what they saw as the administration's accomplishments: An emergency rescue of the economy, a bailout of the auto industry, a form of national health insurance and landmark climate change regulation. All along, many described climbing a learning curve on how young and old Americans get their news, red and blue “team” politics — and how to leverage social media, something Trump seemed to innately understand.\n\nAn extraordinary stretch that began in April 2011 illustrated the denial, the dismissal and what's thought to have been a moment that helped cement Trump's decision to run for president.\n\nThe New York mogul had been fueling the false conspiracy theory that Obama, who was born in Hawaii, had not been born in the United States. That suggested he was not qualified to be president, a question that touched on Obama's race. It bothered him personally, advisers said, and initially Obama agreed with many advisers to ignore it.\n\n“He felt with all the important things that needed to be dealt with, this was stupid and shouldn’t be dignified. But ultimately, it had to be,” recalled David Axelrod, then Obama's senior adviser.\n\nObama released his long-form birth certificate on April 27, showing he'd been born in Hawaii.\n\n“I thought it was a mistake at the time, because I thought, 'This is absurd, and it’s unnecessary and beneath him to dignify the question,” Nancy-Ann DeParle, a former White House deputy chief of staff for policy.\n\nWhat it meant for speechwriter Jon Favreau was that Obama's jokes for the White House Correspondents Dinner just a few days later had to be changed. They knew Trump would be at the dinner and the issues at hand, Favreau said in his interview, were serious. “I thought what he was doing was racist,” Favreau said. “I thought that it was not just damaging to Obama but damaging to the country.”\n\nSeriousness aside, he described a marathon of joke-writing with Hollywood director and writer Judd Apatow on the phone that left Favreau and others in hysterics. The prospect of Trump becoming president? “Not even a brief moment did I ever think that,” he said.\n\nAs for the speech, Obama “loved it,” Favreau said. Obama's sense of humor, he noted, can lean sarcastic.\n\nObama opened with a cheery, “Mahalo!” and played a mock birth video in a dig at Fox News.\n\n“I want to make clear to the Fox News table: That was a joke,” he said. “That was not my real birth video. That was a children’s cartoon.”\n\nThen he noted that “Donald Trump is here tonight!” Trump glowered from his table.\n\n\"We all know about your credentials and breadth of experience,” Obama continued, as the Washington glitterati snickered. Just recently on Trump's show, the president said, “At the steakhouse, the men’s cooking team did not impress the judges from Omaha Steaks. And there was a lot of blame to go around.” Whom to fire in such a situation, Obama said sarcastically, was among “the kind of decisions that would keep me up at night.”\n\nThe next day, Obama announced the killing of Sept. 11 mastermind Osama bin Laden during a U.S. commando raid in Pakistan. He'd authorized the strike earlier in the week without the knowledge of most close aides, and so knew about it as he relished his takedown of Trump.\n\n“In some ways, it was cathartic for the president,” Axelrod said of the speech.\n\nEarlier in the evening, he recalled, he walked by Trump's table and overheard him saying he's toying with running for president. Axelrod “chuckled at it and went to my seat.”\n\n“Obviously, we misread that,” he said.",

    "description": "Investors are drawing their battle lines as AI sorts tech companies into winners and losers.",
    "fullText": "The once relentless rally in AI-fueled stocks has lost momentum, as investors confront the unsettling idea that advances in artificial intelligence could erode the very value propositions that made tech giants dominant in the first place. Yet some executives and market veterans warn against short-term panic, calling the selloff a rare opportunity to buy into the next phase of the AI boom.\n\nThe AI growth story has been tempered by a widespread selloff in software stocks. Call it the software-mageddon or the SaaSpocalypse, but companies who specialize in designing, selling, and maintaining digital software products are getting battered. Earlier this month, JPMorgan analysts wrote that software companies had lost around $2 trillion in value over the past year, calling it “the largest non-recessionary 12-month drawdown in over 30 years.”\n\nThe culprit has been an increasingly widespread feeling among investors that AI is sorting tech players into winners and losers. Under this view, software companies could fall into the latter camp as the capabilities of newer AI models promise to replace expensive digital services, rendering the business models of companies like Salesforce and Atlassian obsolete.\n\nBut not all investors are convinced these companies are destined for irrelevance. Hidden within the chaos could lie an undervalued chance to buy these tech stocks at a discount, a relative rarity in an age of soaring valuations and speculative growth. It all depends on whether bullish buyers consider AI as complementary to existing software services, or capable enough to replace them entirely.\n\n“I think this software selloff will go down as a generational opportunity to own some of the stalwarts,” Dan Ives, a managing director and senior equity research analyst at Wedbush Securities, said in a Yahoo Finance interview Friday. “I feel more emboldened about the bull thesis on tech and AI this year, despite obviously this massive pullback.”\n\nIves named three industry leaders that he sees as being unfairly punished in today’s market, and that could be in for a powerful rebound:\n\nIves called the software stock correction a “structural selloff” that was the largest in scale he’d seen in 25 years. But instead of spelling doom for these companies, he framed the wipeout as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to invest in enterprise technology, arguing that software developers will remain a “core part of the use cases,” even in an AI-powered future.",

    "fullText": "Data analytics firm moves from Denver after about six years and joins host of businesses relocating to south Florida\n\nPalantir announced on Tuesday that it has moved its headquarters to Miami from Denver. The data analytics company, criticized for its role in the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, joins a host of other businesses and billionaires that recently moved to Florida in search of a more business-friendly climate.\n\nPalantir’s move across state lines comes after its chair, Peter Thiel, announced on 31 December that he opened a Miami office for his private investment firm. Thiel already has a mansion in Miami Beach. The company, previously headquartered in Palo Alto, announced the move on X but did not provide further details or respond to a request for comment. Palantir’s stay in Colorado lasted about six years; the company exited California in August 2020 – with its CEO, Alex Karp, citing disagreements with the state’s values.\n\nPalantir’s Denver office has frequently been the site of protest, as the company faces heated criticism for its involvement in the Trump administration’s push to deport immigrants. Tools and platforms built by Palantir have been used by the federal government in efforts to surveil and detain immigrants. The company has also inked a major contract with the UK’s National Health Service.\n\nColorado’s immigration and tech activists view Palantir’s departure as a result of their sustained organizing. Juan Sebastian Pinto, a former Palantir employee and organizer for AI regulation in Denver, said that a coalition of unions and grassroots organizations, including Denver Anti-War Action, held a few dozen town halls, strikes and protests that mounted pressure on Palantir’s presence in the city. Pinto also said that Palantir may have been dissuaded by Colorado’s state lawmakers taking the lead on AI regulation with proposals to limit surveillance and discrimination.\n\n“Colorado has rejected the values of Palantir – the values of an economy built on exploitation of people’s data, whether it’s for warfare or for immigration enforcement,” Pinto said.\n\nMany of California’s wealthiest billionaires seem to be considering a move to Florida – spooked by the state’s consideration of a billionaire tax. There has also been a concerted effort by the business leaders Ken Griffin and Stephen Ross to convince billionaires to move to south Florida and to bring their businesses with them.\n\nPalantir has tried to distance itself from Trump’s immigration apparatus, but that has not quelled protest. Some of the company’s employees appear to be disturbed, too. Karp recorded a video about Palantir’s involvement with ICE for staff and said they could sign NDAs if they wanted more details, according to Wired.\n\nJames Fishback, a Republican candidate for Florida governor, wrote on X in response to Palantir’s move, saying he would ban Palantir from all government contracts if elected. “You are a threat to our civil liberties,” Fishback wrote. He had voiced the same position last month. Fishback’s commitment comes amid increasing pressure on lawmakers to evaluate their relationship with Palantir. The nationwide campaign Purge Palantir has been documenting politicians who received funds from the company’s executives and pressuring them not to accept their donations. The campaign has had some success so far. The Colorado Sun reported that the Colorado representative Jason Crow and Colorado senator John Hickenlooper planned to donate more than $50,000 each, in campaign contributions from Palantir, to immigrant rights groups.\n\nPalantir blew past Wall Street expectations for the fourth quarter of 2025 and reported 66% year-over-year growth in revenue from government contracts, to $570m. Its stock, however, has sunk 20% since the start of 2026.",

    "fullText": "Substances include chemicals that can cause cancer, neurodevelopmental problems and the feminisation of males\n\nYou wear them at work, you wear them at play, you wear them to relax. You may even get sweaty in them at the gym.\n\nBut an investigation into headphones has found every single pair tested contained substances hazardous to human health, including chemicals that can cause cancer, neurodevelopmental problems and the feminisation of males.\n\nEven products by market-leading brands such as Bose, Panasonic, Samsung and Sennheiser were found to contain harmful chemicals in the formulation of the plastics from which they are made.\n\nCampaigners condemned “a market-wide failure” as they called for broad bans on whole classes of endocrine-disrupting chemicals in consumer goods and greater transparency from manufacturers about what is in their products.\n\n“These chemicals are not just additives; they may be migrating from the headphones into our body,” said Karolína Brabcová, chemical expert at Arnika, part of the ToxFree LIFE for All project, a partnership of central European civil society groups that carried out the research.\n\n“Daily use – especially during exercise when heat and sweat are present – accelerates this migration directly to the skin.\n\n“Although there is no immediate health risk, the long-term exposures – especially for vulnerable groups like teenagers – is of great concern. There is no ‘safe’ level for endocrine disruptors that mimic our natural hormones.”\n\nAround the world, there is increasing concern over the potential impacts of contaminating ecosystems, animals and humans with synthetic chemicals, and fears they are linked to the global rise in rates of cancer, obesity and infertility.\n\nMany chemicals that have become ubiquitous, such as bisphenols, phthalates and poly- and per-fluoroalkyl substances (Pfas) have subsequently been discovered to have drastic biological effects. Despite that, many continue to be used in the manufacture of consumer goods, with little public awareness of what they are and what they might be doing to people.\n\nResearchers say that while individual doses from particular sources may be low, a “cocktail effect” of daily, multi-source exposure nevertheless poses potentially severe long-term risks to health.\n\nCampaigners from the ToxFree project said they decided to investigate the presence of such chemicals in headphones because the devices had “transitioned from occasional accessories to essential tools”, worn by users for long periods.\n\nResearchers bought 81 pairs of in-ear and over-ear headphones, either on the market in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia and Austria, or from the online marketplaces Shein and Temu, and took them for laboratory analysis, testing for a range of harmful chemicals.\n\n“Hazardous substances were detected in every product tested,” they said.\n\nBisphenol A (BPA) appeared in 98% of samples, and its substitute, bisphenol S (BPS), was found in more than three-quarters. Synthetic chemicals used to stiffen plastic, BPA and BPS mimic the action of oestrogen inside organisms, causing a range of adverse effects including the feminisation of males, early onset puberty in girls, and cancer. Previous studies have shown that bisphenols can migrate from synthetic materials into sweat, and that they can be absorbed through the skin.\n\n“Given the prolonged skin contact associated with headphone use, dermal exposure represents a relevant pathway, and it is reasonable to assume that similar migration of BPA and its substitutes may occur from headphone components directly to the user’s skin,” the researchers said.\n\nAlso found in the headphones tested were phthalates, potent reproductive toxins that can impair fertility; chlorinated paraffins, which have been linked to liver and kidney damage; and brominated and organophosphate flame retardants, which have similar endocrine disrupting properties to bisphenols. Most were, however, found in only trace quantities.\n\nThe headphones investigation is the third undertaken by the ToxFree project. Previous investigations found bisphenol A, a known hormone disruptor, in baby dummies, including some labelled BPA-free, and that one in three pairs of women’s underpants contained toxic chemicals.\n\nBose, Panasonic, Samsung and Sennheiser did not respond to requests for comment.",

    "fullText": "Eye-catching martial arts performance at China gala had viewers and experts wondering what else humanoids can do\n\nDancing humanoid robots took centre stage on Monday during the annual China Media Group’s Spring Festival Gala, China’s most-watched official television broadcast. They lunged and backflipped (landing on their knees), they spun around and jumped. Not one fell over.\n\nThe display was impressive, but prompted some to wonder: if robots can now dance and perform martial arts, what else can they do?\n\nExperts have mixed opinions, with some saying the robots had limitations and that the display should be viewed through a lens of state propaganda.\n\nDeveloped by several Chinese robotics firms, the robots performed a range of intricate stunts, including kung fu, comedy sketches and choreographed dance moves alongside human performers.\n\nClips circulating online quickly drew comparisons with last year’s lunar new year broadcast, which also featured dancing robots but with noticeably simpler movements.\n\nKyle Chan, an expert in China’s technology development at Brookings Institution, a policy organisation in Washington DC, said Beijing uses these public robot performances to “dazzle domestic and international audiences with China’s technological prowess”.\n\n“Unlike AI models or industrial equipment, humanoid robots are highly visible examples of China’s technological leadership that general audiences can see on their phones or televisions,” he said.\n\nPointing to intensifying competition in the tech space between China and the US, Chan added: “While China and the US are neck-and-neck on AI, humanoid robots are an area where China can claim to be ahead of the US, particularly in terms of scaling up production.”\n\nGeorg Stieler, the head of robotics and automation at the global technology consulting firm Stieler Technology and Marketing, also emphasised the symbolism of China’s prime time broadcast.\n\n“What distinguishes the gala from comparable events elsewhere is the directness of the pipeline from industrial policy to prime-time spectacle,” Stieler said in a statement.\n\nComparing this year’s performances with last year’s – when viewers saw “fundamentally a single choreographic mode” with limited motions including walking, twisting and kicking – Stieler said one key signal of China’s robot progress is “the ability to run large numbers of near-identical humanoids in synchronised motion with stable gaits and consistent joint behaviour”.\n\nBut Stieler also noted: “Stage performance does not equate to industrial robustness, yet.” He said what the robots did was the result of being trained for a routine “hundreds or thousands of times – you could not just tell them to change direction or do something completely different”.\n\n“These dance motions involve very little environmental perception and are essentially imitation learning plus a balance-keeping controller. That has little bearing on reliability in unstructured environments, a prerequisite for factory-grade deployment. Also the progress in dexterity is not as fast as in locomotion,” he added.\n\nThe unveiling of China’s latest generation of robots underscores the country’s broader technological ambitions.\n\nMorgan Stanley projects that China’s humanoid sales will more than double to 28,000 units in 2026; and Elon Musk has said he expects his biggest competitor to be Chinese companies as he pivots Tesla toward a focus on embodied AI and its flagship humanoid Optimus. “People outside China underestimate China, but China is an ass-kicker next level,” Musk said last month.\n\nMarina Zhang, a technology professor at the University of Technology Sydney, said that such a visible showcase likely hints at a new phase in China’s manufacturing masterplan, “where robotics becomes a linchpin in the shift from low-cost assembly to high-end, smart manufacturing”.",

    "fullText": "Prof Michael Wooldridge says scenario such as deadly self-driving car update or AI hack could destroy global interest\n\nThe race to get artificial intelligence to market has raised the risk of a Hindenburg-style disaster that shatters global confidence in the technology, a leading researcher has warned.\n\nMichael Wooldridge, a professor of AI at Oxford University, said the danger arose from the immense commercial pressures that technology firms were under to release new AI tools, with companies desperate to win customers before the products’ capabilities and potential flaws are fully understood.\n\nThe surge in AI chatbots with guardrails that are easily bypassed showed how commercial incentives were prioritised over more cautious development and safety testing, he said.\n\n“It’s the classic technology scenario,” he said. “You’ve got a technology that’s very, very promising, but not as rigorously tested as you would like it to be, and the commercial pressure behind it is unbearable.”\n\nWooldridge, who will deliver the Royal Society’s Michael Faraday prize lecture on Wednesday evening, titled “This is not the AI we were promised”, said a Hindenburg moment was “very plausible” as companies rushed to deploy more advanced AI tools.\n\nThe Hindenburg, a 245-metre airship that made round trips across the Atlantic, was preparing to land in New Jersey in 1937 when it burst into flames, killing 36 crew, passengers and ground staff. The inferno was caused by a spark that ignited the 200,000 cubic metres of hydrogen that kept the airship aloft.\n\n“The Hindenburg disaster destroyed global interest in airships; it was a dead technology from that point on, and a similar moment is a real risk for AI,” Wooldridge said. Because AI is embedded in so many systems, a major incident could strike almost any sector.\n\nThe scenarios Wooldridge imagines include a deadly software update for self-driving cars, an AI-powered hack that grounds global airlines, or a Barings bank-style collapse of a major company, triggered by AI doing something stupid. “These are very, very plausible scenarios,” he said. “There are all sorts of ways AI could very publicly go wrong.”\n\nDespite the concerns, Wooldridge said he did not intend to attack modern AI. His starting point is the gap between what researchers expected and what has emerged. Many experts anticipated AI that computed solutions to problems and provided answers that were sound and complete. “Contemporary AI is neither sound nor complete: it’s very, very approximate,” he said.\n\nThis arises because large language models, which underpin today’s AI chatbots, rattle out answers by predicting the next word, or part of a word, based on probability distributions learned in training. It leads to AIs with jagged capabilities: incredibly effective at some tasks, yet terrible at others.\n\nThe problem, Wooldridge said, was that AI chatbots failed in unpredictable ways and had no idea when they were wrong, but were designed to provide confident answers regardless. When delivered in human-like and sycophantic responses, the answers could easily mislead people, he added. The risk is that people start treating AIs as if they were human. In a 2025 survey by the Center for Democracy and Technology, nearly a third of students reported that they or a friend had had a romantic relationship with an AI.\n\n“Companies want to present AIs in a very human-like way, but I think that is a very dangerous path to take,” Wooldridge said. “We need to understand that these are just glorified spreadsheets, they are tools and nothing more than that.”\n\nWooldridge sees positives in the kind of AI depicted in the early years of Star Trek. In one 1968 episode, The Day of the Dove, Mr Spock quizzes the Enterprise’s computer only to be told in a distinctly non-human voice that it has insufficient data to answer. “That’s not what we get. We get an overconfident AI that says: yes, here’s the answer,” he said. “Maybe we need AIs to talk to us in the voice of the Star Trek computer. You would never believe it was a human being.”",

    "fullText": "Google, Anthropic and OpenAI bosses to mingle with global south leaders wrestling for control over technology\n\nSilicon Valley tech billionaires will land in Delhi this week for an AI summit hosted by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, where leaders of the global south will wrestle for control over the fast-developing technology.\n\nDuring the week-long AI Impact Summit, attended by thousands of tech executives, government officials and AI safety experts, tech companies valued at trillions of dollars will rub along with leaders of countries such as Kenya and Indonesia, where average wages dip well below $1,000 a month.\n\nAmid a push to speed up AI adoption across the globe, Sundar Pichai, Sam Altman and Dario Amodei, the heads of Google, OpenAI and Anthropic, will all be there. Rishi Sunak and George Osborne, a former British prime minister and a former chancellor, will each be pushing for greater adoption of AI. Sunak has taken jobs for Microsoft and Anthropic and Osborne leads OpenAI’s push to deepen and widen the use of ChatGPT beyond its existing 800 million users.\n\nMeanwhile Modi, who will address the summit on Thursday, is positioning India as the AI hub for south Asia and Africa. On the agenda will be AI’s potential to transform agriculture, water supplies and public health. Governments in Kenya, Senegal, Mauritius, Togo, Indonesia and Egypt will send ministers.\n\nModi’s enthusiasm for AI has a darker side, civil liberties campaigners say. Last week they raised serious concerns about India deploying AI to increase state surveillance, discriminate against minorities and sway elections. But Modi this week spoke of “harnessing artificial intelligence for human-centric progress” and India has given the summit the strapline: “Welfare for all, happiness for all.”\n\nSummit observers talk of a battle between a new kind of AI colonialism from the US tech firms and an alternative “techno-Gandhism”, in which AI is used for social justice and to benefit marginalised people. After global AI summits in the UK, Korea and France, the Delhi meeting is the first to be held in the global south.\n\nIndian commentators say the test of AI’s value is not in its technical sophistication but whether it can improve the lives of people living in some of the toughest circumstances in the global south. By contrast, US AI companies are racing for supremacy, competing with each other and China, and rolling out AI for shopping, personal companionship and agentic systems that could slash corporate labour costs by making white-collar jobs redundant.\n\nIf a referee between the two sides is needed, António Guterres, the secretary general of the United Nations, will speak in Delhi. This week he said it would be “totally unacceptable that AI would be just a privilege of the most developed countries or a division only between two superpowers”.\n\nIndia’s AI Impact Summit is the fourth iteration of the event, which Sunak launched in 2023 at Bletchley Park in the UK, with a focus on international coordination to prevent catastrophic risks from the most advanced AI models. Summits followed in Seoul in 2024 and Paris in 2025, where the US vice-president, JD Vance, appeared to abandon the White House’s interest in safety saying: “The AI future will not be won by hand-wringing about safety; it will be won by building.”\n\nSafety is once again on the agenda, with Yoshua Bengio, one of the “godfathers” of AI, on hand to repeat his fears about the risk of powerful AI systems enabling cyber- and bioweapons attacks.\n\n“The capabilities of AI have continued to advance, and although mitigation and risk management of AI has also progressed [it has happened] not as quickly,” he said on Tuesday. “So it becomes urgent that leaders of this world understand where we could be going and it needs their attention and intervention as soon as possible.”\n\nOne of those working at the summit to make sure AI remains safe will be Nicolas Miaihle, co-founder of the AI Safety Connect group, who noted that the summit was taking place in the shadow of AI-enabled warfare in Ukraine and the Middle East.\n\n“The existential risks are not going anywhere,” he told the Guardian. “When Rishi Sunak started this, the race was not raging as hard. The trillions are pouring in but we are very far away from securing these models. This is profound for democracy, profound for the mental health of our kids and profound for warfare.”\n\nBut the Trump administration continues its policy of refusing to bind US AI companies with red tape. The White House is not expected to send a high-level representative to Delhi, with Sriram Krishnan, its senior AI policy adviser, the highest-ranked speaker listed in the programme.\n\n“Given where we are with the US administration it’s pretty unlikely you’re going to have a massive breakthrough on any consensus on what a regulatory framework will look like,” said one senior AI company source.\n\nCompanies such as Google are focused on the use of AI in education in India, where large language models’ ability to function in many of the country’s dozens of languages is an advantage.\n\n“[There’s] a big focus on access and adoption, how can you make sure that the technology is available as broadly as possible,” said Owen Larter, head of frontier AI policy and public affairs at Google DeepMind. “We’re excited on the education front in India. It’s a remarkable story of an incredibly intense adoption. About 90% of teachers and students already using AI in their learning. We’ve had a big promotional programme where 2 million students have access to our pro subscription for free.”\n\nGoogle’s investments in India include a $15bn spend, in partnership with the conglomerate of Gautam Adani, one of India’s richest billionaires, on an gigawatt-scale AI datacentre hub in the coastal city of Visakhapatnam, in Andhra Pradesh, with subsea cables connecting to other parts of the world.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: ICE more than tripled the amount of data stored in Microsoft’s cloud at the same time that its arsenal of surveillance technology ballooned\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deepened its reliance on Microsoft’s cloud technology last year as the agency ramped up arrest and deportation operations, leaked documents reveal.\n\nICE more than tripled the amount of data it stored in Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform in the six months leading up to January 2026, a period in which the agency’s budget swelled and its workforce rapidly expanded, according to the files.\n\nICE appears to be using a range of Microsoft’s productivity tools, as well as AI-driven products, to search and analyse the data it holds in Azure. Files suggest some of the agency’s own tools and systems may also be running on Microsoft servers.\n\nThe documents – obtained by the Guardian and its partners +972 Magazine and Local Call – raise questions about whether Microsoft technology is facilitating an immigration crackdown by an agency accused of conducting unlawful operations and using excessive force on a large scale.\n\nICE enforcement operations have surged over the past year as part of the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign. The agency is now at the centre of a battle in Congress over its funding, sparked by the deaths of two people in Minneapolis, that has led to a partial shutdown of the US government.\n\nIn July, ICE received a $75bn budget increase, making it the highest-funded US law enforcement body. With this unprecedented increase in funds, the agency has embarked on a spending spree on technology, awarding contracts to large firms such as Palantir alongside lesser-known providers.\n\nICE, which has been likened to a domestic surveillance agency, enjoys access to vast troves of data on people living in the US. It has a growing arsenal of surveillance technology, including facial recognition apps, phone location databases, drones and invasive spyware.\n\nAs the agency expanded through 2025, it boosted spending on cloud computing. Amazon and Microsoft, both longtime providers to ICE and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), have emerged as beneficiaries of deals worth tens of millions of dollars struck by third-party resellers.\n\nThe leaked documents do not specify the kinds of information stored by ICE on Microsoft servers. However, they indicate the agency has used Azure services including “blob storage” of raw data, as well as AI tools that analyse images and videos, and translate text.\n\nIn January, according to the files, ICE held almost 1,400 terabytes in Azure, which if only comprised of photographs would be equivalent to approximately 490m images. This was up from 400 terabytes in July 2025 after climbing through the second half of last year, files suggest.\n\nICE is also using virtual machines on Azure, according to the documents. These are effectively computers that run in the cloud but that can be accessed remotely. ICE appears to be renting these high-powered computers to run software.\n\nThe agency, which has more than doubled its workforce since January 2025, is also understood to have significantly expanded its access to Microsoft’s suite of productivity apps which provide users with access to document management tools and an AI chatbot.\n\nIt’s unclear from the files whether ICE is using Azure to store or analyse information collected through any of its surveillance or intelligence gathering activities, or whether the cloud platform supports other functions, such as the running of detention centres or deportation flights. ICE did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA spokesperson for Microsoft said it “provides cloud-based productivity and collaboration tools to DHS and ICE, delivered through our key partners”. They said Microsoft’s policies and terms of service “do not allow our technology to be used for the mass surveillance of civilians, and we do not believe ICE is engaged in such activity”.\n\nThe spokesperson added: “There are currently many public issues relating to immigration enforcement, and we believe Congress, the executive branch, and the courts have the opportunity to draw clear legal lines regarding the allowable use of emerging technologies by law enforcement.”\n\nIf you have something to share about this story, you can contact Harry using one of the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories. Messages are end to end encrypted and concealed within the routine activity that every Guardian mobile app performs. This prevents an observer from knowing that you are communicating with us at all, let alone what is being said.\n\nIf you don’t already have the Guardian app, download it (iOS/Android) and go to the menu. Select ‘Secure Messaging’.\n\nTo send a message to Harry, please choose the ‘UK Investigations’ team.\n\nYou can message Harry using the Signal Messenger app. Use the ‘find by username’ option and type hfd.90\n\nIf you don’t need a high level of security or confidentiality you can email harry.davies@theguardian.com\n\nSecureDrop and other secure methods\n\nIf you can safely use the tor network without being observed or monitored you can send messages and documents to the Guardian via our SecureDrop platform.\n\nFinally, our guide at theguardian.com/tips lists several ways to contact us securely, and discusses the pros and cons of each.\n\nAccording to Microsoft sources, several employees have in recent months raised concerns internally about ICE’s use of the company’s technology, including by filing internal ethics reports.\n\nIn December 2025, the company responded to one such report by stating that it did not have any current contracts that “support immigration enforcement”. The company later appeared to narrow this position. It acknowledged to employees it had contracts with ICE and DHS, but said it “does not presently maintain AI services contracts tied specifically to enforcement activities”.\n\nMicrosoft is not alone in facing disquiet among employees over its business with federal immigration authorities. For large US tech groups, ICE and sister agency Customs and Border Protection (CBP) have long been customers, but have become increasingly controversial for their aggressive tactics and involvement in fatal shootings.\n\nLast week, Amazon workers and activists protested outside the company’s Seattle headquarters, demanding the company cut ties with federal immigration agencies. The company benefits from a series of large cloud deals with DHS to provide cloud infrastructure to ICE and CBP.\n\nAt Google, which provides cloud services to both agencies, more than 1,300 workers have signed a recent petition with a similar set of demands. “DHS is violating civil and national law as well as civil and human rights,” the petition reads. “We must end our complicity in powering them.”\n\nBeyond the headlines: inside stories from the Guardian’s investigations team.

    "fullText": "This is a developing story. Check back for updates.\n\nBLOOMFIELD HILLS — Once the Marysville High School hockey team found a rhythm, it rapidly ran away with victory Tuesday, Feb. 17.\n\nThe Vikings rolled Grosse Pointe North, 7-0, in an MHSAA Division 3 regional quarterfinal at Wallace Ice Arena.\n\nSenior forward Luke Thick totaled two goals and two assists for Marysville (16-12-0), which advanced to the regional semifinal against Cranbrook Kingswood (17-7-0) on Friday, Feb. 20.\n\n\"It was just (about) sticking with the process,\" Marysville coach Dennis Thick said in an email. \"We knew the first (period) was going to be tight, as they were going to throw everything they had at us. We really started moving the puck well and working together.\"\n\nThe rout started at the 6:58 mark of the opening period, when Luke Thick broke the scoreless tie with his first goal. But it was junior netminder Ryan Winn (27 saves), who helped the Vikings maintain a 1-0 edge at the first intermission.\n\n\"Winnie has been playing lights out,\" Dennis Thick said of Winn. \"He made the saves early on in the first and kept it a 1-0 game until the boys could get some production going. He’s moving well and seeing the puck very well. Great awareness.\"\n\nMORE: MHSAA hockey regional pairings, results for Blue Water Area teams\n\nMidway through the second period, Marysville blew the game open with three goals in just under seven minutes. Junior forward Drew Kryscynski scored at 14:01, followed by sophomore defenseman Daniel Healy at 11:29.\n\nFour minutes later, Luke Thick netted his second goal of the night to put the Vikings in front, 4-0.\n\n\"Luke is one of our main leaders,\" said Dennis, who is also Luke's dad. \"He’s really good about seeing the ice and getting his teammates involved. When Luke is going it seems like the whole team gets going. Definitely liked his jump tonight.\"\n\nMarysville added three more goals in the third period, courtesy of Parker Sheffer (13:59), Theo Beauchamp (8:44) and Austin O'Boyle (4:58).\n\nPuck drop for Friday's regional semifinal is 5 p.m. at Wallace Ice Arena. It'll be the first meeting of the season between Marysville and Cranbrook Kingswood.\n\nPort Huron Northern's season ended Tuesday with an overtime loss to L'Anse Creuse Unified in a Division 2 regional quarterfinal. Tyson Skotcher, Draven Rogers and Evan Fagan all scored for the Huskies, who finished 6-19-1.\n\nLogan Jarvey had four goals for Unified, the first of which came 55 seconds into the game.\n\nHowever, Northern answered with two in the final five minutes of the opening period. Skotcher's came at 4:19, while Rogers netted the go-ahead goal exactly three minutes later.\n\nAfter Jarvey evened the score late in the second period, Northern regained the advantage, 3-2, just 34 seconds into the third on a shot from Fagan.\n\nBut Jarvey buried the equalizer with 3:35 remaining in regulation. Then, he scored the game-winning goal at the 8:00 mark of overtime.\n\nContact Brenden Welper at bwelper@usatodayco.com.

    "fullText": "Baltimore Orioles trade proposal answers biggest question by landing right-hander who throws 100 MPH originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Baltimore Orioles were one of the more aggressive teams in Major League Baseball during the offseason, but it still feels like they could use more on the mound. If the Orioles want to compete with the top teams in the American League, not only do they have to be better offensively from what they were a season ago, but they need to be a lot better on the mound\n\nIn a mock trade from Thomas Carelli of Sports Illustrated, Baltimore would acquire electric right-hander Hunter Greene from the Cincinnati Reds in a deal built around average talent.\n\nReds receive: Dean Kremer, Three Top-20 Orioles prospects\n\n“Baltimore really wants to see their team great again. They have a deep rotation, but it's not very good. It is all mid-tier starters from Trevor Rogers down to Kyle Bradish and Shane Baz,” Carelli wrote.\n\nAdding Greene would immediately change any questions the Orioles have about their rotation, short and long term, as he's one of the best young starters in baseball.\n\n“By adding Greene, they secure a high-end ace that can carry this young team for the next few years. It is a glaring weakness that the Orioles can now strengthen,” he added.\n\nGreen dealt with an injury last season, but bounced back nicely in the second half. He ended up posting a 2.76 ERA and striking out 132 batters in just 107.2 innings. It's tough to see why the Reds would move on from him, but if the Orioles could grab him for this package, it's an easy deal to make.\n\nEx-Dodgers pitcher Trevor Bauer seemingly takes shot at MLBPA after latest news\n\nMLB Hot Stove tracker: Live updates on news, rumors, signings and trades for 2025 free agency\n\nFormer Yankees, Reds, A's outfielder agrees to $4M deal with Padres\n\nTigers' contract details for Framber Valdez make for absurd record-breaking deal\n\nMLB analyst makes the case for the Phillies to sign 2x All-Star arm\n\nPirates to sign former Padres, White Sox 3.55 ERA veteran righty on one-year deal",

    "fullText": "The Kentucky Wildcats suffered a brutal home loss to the Georgia Bulldogs, 86-78. The Wildcats were in cruise control too early and lacked urgency while suffering another brutal loss on Mark Pope’s resume.\n\nPer Ryan Black of the Courier Journal Sports, this is only the second time in the history of the series that Georgia has won three times in a four-game span versus the Wildcats. The last time this occurred was more than 100 years ago: Cats won the first meeting in 1921; Bulldogs won the next three.\n\nJust a gut-wrenching loss for the Wildcats all the way across the board. They had not lost to the Bulldogs inside Rupp Arena since 2009, late into the Billy Gillispie era.\n\nIn what has been a roller-coaster season for Pope, the schedule will not be getting any lighter as March is on the Horizon. The Wildcats will go on the road to face Auburn, No. 19 Vanderbilt, at Texas A&M, and back at Rupp to face a red-hot Florida Gators team. We will get to see how Pope handles this gruesome stretch before tournament play.\n\nThe Wildcats drop two in a row and fall to 17-9 on the season. They’re back in action on Saturday night on the road against Steven Pearl’s Tigers in what will be a raucous environment. Tip-off is set for 8:30 p.m. ET on ESPN.\n\nThis is only the second time in the history of the series Georgia has won three times in a four-game span versus Kentucky. Last such instance was more than 100 years ago: UK won first meeting in 1921; UGA won next three.\n\n— Ryan Black (@RyanABlack) February 18, 2026",

Anisimova, who is competing in the Dubai Tennis Championships currently, had similar views about the pop icon as Coco Gauff and Naomi Osaka. Amid the criticism from Swifties, tennis fans came to Anisimova’s rescue.\n\nTennis star Amanda Anisimova is under fire from Taylor Swift’s fans for her opinion of the Fortnight singer.\n\nWhen the Tennis Channel interviewer asked her, “What was the name of the last Taylor Swift album?” Anisimova replied, “Oh, I don’t like Taylor Swift, sorry.” Similarly, Gauff also stated, “I’m not a Taylor Swift fan, so I don’t know. The Swifties are going to attack me.” Osaka also had the same opinion, “So Taylor Swift is where I don’t know anything. I just know there was a song named ‘Opalite’.”\n\n“The Swifties are gonna attack me.” ? \n\nGo easy on @CocoGauff, Taylor Nation. pic.twitter.com/hFAnlTvNS4\n\n— Tennis Channel (@TennisChannel) February 15, 2026\n\nA Swiftie commented on the clip, “‘I don’t like Taylor Swift’- Amanda Anisimova “and I don’t wanna know” – Jessica Pegula The difference between men and women in this video. Those men didn’t even know her, yet they still respected her.”\n\nAnother fan noted, “and it’s always with “omg swifties don’t come for me”. Well how about you shut the f**k up then?”\n\nAnother fan went on to target the Tennis star, “The level of clout chasing with Taylor Swift’s name is unheard of leave that woman alone! And anyone being weird about her unprovoked, when they don’t even know her, is already saying a lot about their own character.”\n\nA fan stated in her tweet, “LMAO oh Taylor Queen, your name and clout are used to attract attention in every country, every sports event, and all entertainment circles, legend!”\n\nA Swiftie added, “Leave us and Taylor alone please. No one cares about you.”\n\nOriginally reported by Ishita Verma on Mandatory\n\nThe post Taylor Swift Fans Criticize US Tennis Player For Not Liking Her appeared first on Reality Tea.",

    "fullText": "The Premier League big six are concerned about a proposed centralised advertising model that could generate an additional £750 million annually, according to the Daily Mail.\n\nPremier League officials presented the proposal during a recent shareholder meeting.\n\nThey outlined plans to adopt a US-style system where the league would negotiate and sell a significant portion of pitch-side advertising on behalf of all clubs.\n\nThe model would see 60% of perimetre advertising controlled centrally while increasing the number of top-tier commercial partners from seven to 10.\n\nThe league would then distribute the additional revenue among the 20 clubs based on various performance and commercial criteria.\n\nHowever, the proposal has reportedly been met with scepticism from members of the so-called big six – Manchester United, Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool.\n\nWhile none of the clubs publicly commented, sources suggest several are unconvinced about the proposal’s overall value.\n\nOne major concern centres on the extensive commercial operations already run by top clubs, with many believing their in-house expertise surpasses what a league-wide structure could deliver.\n\nThere are also fears surrounding potential conflicts with existing sponsorship deals.\n\nFor instance, if the league were to secure a central automotive partner, it could clash with club-specific agreements already in place.\n\nUnder current rules, the league allows five minutes of pitch-side advertising per match, with broadcasters controlling three minutes when games are televised.\n\nThe new proposal would significantly change how those commercial opportunities are sold and distributed.\n\nDespite resistance from leading clubs, the initiative could attract support from smaller teams looking to benefit from the global commercial pull of the league’s biggest brands and bolster their finances.\n\nLeague insiders maintain that the proposal is backed by strong financial analysis and is being explored to maximise collective revenues, with further discussions expected before any formal vote is introduced.",

    "fullText": "The contracts of several Manchester United stars are up in the summer, including key performer Harry Maguire.\n\nCasemiro has already announced he is leaving at the conclusion of the current campaign, while both Tyrell Malacia and Jadon Sancho are expected to follow suit.\n\nHowever, INEOS remain undecided on the centre-back’s future. He currently earns £190,000 gross per week, excluding bonuses (via capology), and the only way for him to extend his Old Trafford career is if he agrees to take a pay cut.\n\nWhile the England international would prefer to stay, the lure of Middle Eastern riches and the chance to reunite with a former manager has made the choice tougher.\n\nAccording to The Sun, Al Qadsiah, currently managed by former Leicester City boss Brendan Rodgers, have the 32-year-old in their sights.\n\nThe Saudi club can afford to hand the defender a major pay rise, which at this stage of his career, would be hard to turn down.\n\n“MANCHESTER UNITED centre-back Harry Maguire is keen to extend his stay at Old Trafford – but he is now wanted by his former Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers at Al-Qadsiah.\n\n“The England star, 32, is facing an uncertain future because his contract, which is worth close to £200,000-a-week, is set to expire in the summer.\n\n“And Maguire, who has to take a pay cut to remain on board, would make more money by leaving United on a free transfer due to signing on fees.”\n\nMichael Carrick had already blocked his exit in January when multiple Serie A sides expressed interest in arranging a pre-contract agreement.\n\nThe rest of the United squad have already sent a clear message to the co-owners: they want Harry Maguire to stay due to his quality on and off the pitch.\n\nDilly-dallying on INEOS’ part could lead to the former club captain leaving. That would not be great for team morale.\n\nHe has really turned his United career around, and has taken his game to greater heights since Carrick’s arrival. Hopefully, he is fit enough to face Everton next week.\n\nFeature image Michael Reagan via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "Here's what to keep an eye on during the 12th day of the Olympics in Italy.",
    "fullText": "The Winter Games have begun in Italy. From the rink to the slopes, a new generation of stars has emerged to chase gold. We’ll keep you connected to all of the thrilling moments and top stories as we track the medal race each day of the Games.\n\nTeam USA is up to 21 medals after a pair of second-place finishes on Tuesday in Italy. There are several opportunities for the Americans to add to that count on Wednesday, too. And, while there's no medal up for grabs yet, the men's hockey team is back in action in a must-win quarterfinal game against Sweden.\n\nHere are the top five things to watch on Wednesday at the 2026 Milan Cortina Olympics:\n\nThis was rescheduled due to weather, and a trio of Americans will try to reach the podium in what is sure to be an entertaining final. Red Gerard is perhaps the most notable among them after his gold medal win in PyeongChang in 2018 when he was just 17 years old. He missed the podium completely four years ago, however. Jake Cander and Oliver Martin will also be competing for Team USA.\n\nMark McMorris of Canada will attempt to win a fourth straight medal in the event, too. He won bronze four years ago. China’s Su Yiming, the silver medal winner in Beijing, is also in the final.\n\nLike the men’s competition, the women’s snowboard slopestyle final was also rescheduled to Wednesday. All eyes will be on New Zealand’s Zoi Sadowski-Synnott, who is the favorite to defend her gold medal from four years ago. She posted the highest score in the qualifying round, and also won silver in the Big Air competition earlier in the Games.\n\nJessica Perlmutter and Lily Dhawornvej are the two Americans who reached the final, though they will have some work to do to reach the podium in this loaded field.\n\nThe U.S. men’s and women’s curling teams will each take on Great Britain on Wednesday in group play.\n\nThe women’s team holds a 5-2 record so far in group play after a dominant 10-3 win over Denmark on Tuesday, their largest win so far of the Games. They’ll wrap up with a match against Switzerland on Thursday before the knockout stage gets going.\n\nThe men’s team is in worse shape entering the match. They hold a 4-4 record after falling to both China and Italy on Tuesday, which has them in fifth. A win is critical, and still may not get them into the finals.\n\nAfter an undefeated run throughout the group stage, the U.S. men’s hockey team will take the ice again on Wednesday in the quarterfinals. They’ll take on Sweden, who beat Latvia 5-1 in a qualification round game on Tuesday.\n\nMen’s hockey beat Germany 5-1 after a slow start on Sunday to wrap up the group stage action, though they were far less dominant than they could have been. Sweden entered Milan as a medal favorite, too, and only lost their group due to a goal differential. Wednesday’s match looks like it’ll be far from easy for the Americans.\n\nAndrew Heo made it through qualifying on Monday, so he’ll have a shot at a medal in the men’s 500-meter short track speed skating final on Wednesday night. The 24-year-old won the event at the ISU Short Track World Tour last fall, and he won his qualifying heat handily.\n\nHeo will have to get past Canada’s Steven Dubois, who won bronze in the event in Beijing four years ago, and favorite William Dandjinou to reach the podium. The Canadian duo posted two of the fastest three qualifying times on Monday.\n\n4 a.m.: Women’s run 1 (USA Network)\n\n7:20 a.m.: Women’s run 2 (USA Network coverage begins at 7:55 a.m.)🏅\n\n8:45 a.m.: Women’s final (airs on USA Network at 3:45 p.m.)🏅\n\n3:45 a.m.: Men’s and women’s qualifying (airs on USA Network 5 a.m.)\n\n5:35 a.m.: Men’s and women’s finals (airs on USA Network at 8:30 a.m.)🏅\n\n3:05 a.m.: USA vs. Great Britain (airs on USA Network at 9:15 a.m.), China vs. Denmark, Sweden vs. South Korea\n\n1:05 p.m.: Great Britain vs. Japan, Switzerland vs. Denmark, Canada vs. Italy (airs on USA Network at 8 p.m.), China vs. Sweden\n\n8:05 a.m.: USA vs. Great Britain (airs on CNBC at 5 p.m.), Italy vs. Canada, China vs. Czechia, Norway vs. Switzerland\n\n5:30 a.m.: Women's final (5:30 a.m.)🏅\n\n6:10 a.m.: Slovakia vs. Germany (airs on USA Network at 1 p.m.)\n\n10:40 a.m.: Canada va.

On paper, still, the Yankees have to like their chances in the American League, even after losing to the Toronto Blue Jays last year.\n\nEvery contending team can use some more pitching, and in a trade pitch from Mark Morales-Smith of Sports Illustrated, New York would add left-handed reliever JoJo Romero from the St. Louis Cardinals to strengthen its pen.\n\nCardinals get: Dax Kilby, Kyle Carr\n\n“The Yankees want to win the World Series, and they want to win it this year.

    "fullText": "SAN DIEGO – Viejas Arena has had its share of moments over the years where the San Diego State Aztecs have unnerved their opponents down the stretch.\n\nOn Tuesday night, uncharacteristically it was the Aztecs who at times appeared sped up in the second half, as the Grand Canyon Lopes took advantage of four turnovers over the final six-and-a-half minutes and salted the season series with a 73-63 win on Tuesday night.\n\nMiles Byrd led SDSU (18-7, 12-3 Mountain West) with 18 points, scoring 13 in the second stanza, but the hosts shot just 31.3% from the field in the final 20 minutes, including making 2 of 13 over a nine-minute stretch where Grand Canyon (17-9, 10-5) took control.\n\nJaden Henley scored a game-high 21 points with three steals, while Efe Demirel added 14 points with 11 rebounds and Makiah Williams scored 11 points with seven rebounds and three assists.\n\nA top of the key 3-pointer by Byrd 86 seconds into the second half was the last time the Aztecs held the lead, as GCU responded with an 8-0 run to take the lead. The closest SDSU was able to pull the rest of the way came on Byrd scoring an and-one to make it 43-41 GCU with just over five minutes played.\n\nBut Williams responded with a 3-pointer and Dennis Evans scored a second-chance bucket by hooking a rebound home. Grand Canyon had a 22-12 edge in paint scoring for the second half, part of a 30-26 advantage for the game.\n\nTrailing by 12-points with 8:21 remaining, the final SDSU kick saw the Scarlet and Black pull within 5-points twice, with Tae Simmons making a pair of free-throws after getting fouled in transition with 4:29 to play, then Byrd making a pair of at the line with 1:49 to play.\n\nSimmons finished with 9 points and four rebounds, while Taj DeGourville had 8 points in 22 minutes off the bench — he and Byrd were the only Aztecs to make three or more from the field.\n\nGCU closed the game out by scoring 7 of the final 9 points for the game. The Lopes have won six of the seven games all-time against the Aztecs, including winning two of three contests on The Mesa.\n\nThe opening half started out like a slug-fest, with both teams taking away clear paths to the basket and forcing jump shots. With the Lopes hitting from downtown out of the game, knocking down three of their first six attempts, the visitors were able to build a 9-point lead when Nana Owusu-Anane hit from the left wing with just over ten minutes played.\n\nSDSU struggled getting the ball inside early, unable to get through the length of the Lopes defenders until Pharaoh Compton scored the Scarlet and Black’s first paint bucket on a dip-under layup. Miles Heide scored 5 points in a row for the Aztecs, getting a dunk and then drawing an and-one.\n\nBut the mood began to change after a layup by Henley when Byrd hit SDSU’s first and only triple of the first half at the 7:15 mark, and then knocked the ball free and BJ Davis converted one of two at the line after getting fouled that made it a 4-point deficit.\n\nAfter the Lopes had not missed more than two consecutive shots through the first 11-plus minutes, SDSU limited the visitors to just 1-for-8 shooting down the stretch to turn the game around while putting together a 14-3 scoring run heading into the break.\n\nByrd started it with a fading jumper on the left side of the lane off an in-bounds play, then an SDSU steal led to a Sean Newman Jr. layup. The Aztecs pulled within 1-point when Simmons shook free down low for a slam.\n\nThe only GCU respite was another Owusu-Anane triple, but SDSU scored the final 8 points of the half with DeGourville and Simmons both converting a pair at the line. Then the sophomore guard alley-ooped to Simmons with 75 seconds before halftime that turned Viejas all the way up to ‘madhouse’ status. DeGourville added another transition bucket after a steal, then Byrd forced a 30-second shot clock violation on the Lopes final possession as SDSU led 33-29 at the break.\n\nSDSU fell half-a-game back of Utah State for first place in the conference, with the Aggies hosting Boise State on Wednesday night.\n\nThe Aztecs will head out to Moby Arena to face the Colorado State Rams, who the Scarlet and Black beat 73-50 on Jan. 28. Tip-off from Fort Collins is scheduled for 3 p.m. PT on Saturday, Feb. 21, with televised coverage on CBS Sports Network and a local radio broadcast on 760 AM.",

While he's coming off a tough injury and didn't play well prior to that, it's also tough to give up on a player as young as he is.\n\nHowever, many seem to want to trade him, so I doubt anyone would be upset about the decision to do so if it were to happen.\n\nNew York Yankees trade proposal sends Anthony Volpe to lousy NL team for 25-year-old All-Star shortstop\n\nNew York Yankees trade pitch lands another proven veteran and the price is cheaper than most would think\n\nAtlanta Braves trade proposal swaps Ozzie Albies with best hitter at position in Major League Baseball\n\nBaltimore Orioles trade proposal answers biggest question by landing right-hander who throws 100 MPH\n\nEx-Dodgers pitcher Trevor Bauer seemingly takes shot at MLBPA after latest news\n\nMLB Hot Stove tracker: Live updates on news, rumors, signings and trades for 2025 free agency",

    "fullText": "New York Yankees trade proposal sends Anthony Volpe to lousy NL team for 25-year-old All-Star shortstop originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe shortstop position is one of the top talking points surrounding the New York Yankees, as Anthony Volpe hasn’t been great. One proposed deal looks to address the position with a major shake-up.\n\nIn a mock deal from Thomas Carelli of Sports Illustrated, New York would land infielder CJ Abrams from the Washington Nationals in a swap centered on both MLB talents and prospect capital.\n\nNationals receive: Volpe, Bryce Cunningham, Prospect to be named\n\n“Yankees fans are absolutely fed up with Volpe. As for now, Jose Caballero is the listed starting shortstop. This is due to Volpe's injury, but still, not great,” Carelli wrote.\n\nFrom an offensive standpoint, Abrams is a lot better of a player than Volpe, but to say that he doesn't have his issues on both sides of the baseball would be a bit unfair, as he's good but not great.\n\nCarelli did acknowledge Volpe’s defensive value, but questioned his long-term position of staying in the Bronx. With Volpe set to start the season on the IR due to offseason shoulder surgery, there's a possibility that if Jose Caballero plays well enough, he won't have a place to play on this team.\n\n“Volpe can still be good — he was a Gold Glove. However, his time in New York is nearly over.”\n\nIt's unfortunate that it's gotten to this point, but if the Yankees are serious about winning, it might be better to do it now than in the future.\n\nNew York Yankees trade pitch lands another proven veteran and the price is cheaper than most would think\n\nAtlanta Braves trade proposal swaps Ozzie Albies with best hitter at position in Major League Baseball\n\nBaltimore Orioles trade proposal answers biggest question by landing right-hander who throws 100 MPH\n\nEx-Dodgers pitcher Trevor Bauer seemingly takes shot at MLBPA after latest news\n\nMLB Hot Stove tracker: Live updates on news, rumors, signings and trades for 2025 free agency\n\nFormer Yankees, Reds, A's outfielder agrees to $4M deal with Padres",

    "fullText": "For many Los Angeles Lakers fans, the period leading up to the NBA's Feb. 5 trade deadline was a disappointing one. The Lakers made one minor trade in which they acquired sharpshooter Luke Kennard, and they reportedly stubbornly refused to acquire anyone who had a contract past this season in order to maintain maximum salary cap flexibility this summer.\n\nThey're projected to have roughly $50 million of cap space this offseason, which means they could make at least one significant move and also go down one of several different pathways. Therefore, the opportunity is there for them to truly shape their roster around Luka Doncic and become championship contenders.\n\nAccording to Dave McMenamin of ESPN, Doncic supported L.A.'s cautious approach prior to the trade deadline, even though it yielded little in the way of help for a team that is playoff-caliber but not championship-caliber.\n\n\"A source familiar with Doncic's thinking told ESPN that L.A.'s deadline approach with 'adherence to discipline' and focus on the 'long-term picture' was supported by the 26-year-old star.\"\n\nAt the same time, Doncic reportedly hasn't pushed for the team to go after another true superstar such as the Milwaukee Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo.\n\n\"He has not pushed the team to add a superstar-level co-star for when James is no longer on the roster.\"\n\nIn addition to their substantial cap space, the Lakers will be able to offer two future first-round draft picks, as well as the rights to their 2026 first-rounder, in potential trades this summer. Whether they go all-in on Antetokounmpo or instead pursue a couple of non-stars who will move the needle, this offseason will be the most important one they have had in a while, and it could set the tone for what will transpire over at least the next few seasons.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Luka Doncic supported Lakers' cautious trade deadline approach",

Instead, Philadelphia moved on without worrying about what financial troubles it had to deal with, while the outfielder eventually landed with the San Diego Padres in free agency.\n\nCastellanos was seen getting some work in as a first baseman after signing with the Padres.

    "fullText": "Michigan State basketball welcomed in UCLA on Tuesday night, looking to bounce back from an embarrassing loss to Wisconsin this past Friday. The Spartans answered the bell, dominating the Bruins en route to a 82-59 victory.\n\nFollowing the win, head coach Tom Izzo spoke with the media, this is what he had to say:\n\n\"My sport is harder than yours,\" he says, pointing at Steve Mariucci\n\n\"I guess Mick Cronin upgraded that to a flagrant two, huh? That's the first time I've saw a coach do that. He'll get that straightened out.\"\n\n\"Denham Wojcik hurt his shoulder a bit, that is why he did not play in the second half.\"\n\n\"I thought Jeremy Fears Jr. might've played one of his best games. He played so under control, he didn't take bad shots. I am still waiting for him to take over the team when they switch defenses. I am still asking that of him.\"\n\n\"Hey, we played better, but that wasn't the UCLA team we saw on film.\"\n\n\"I told my team, its about a choice you want to make, it's about an attitude. These swings (in conference play) are enormous.\"\n\n\"I'm not ready to give Jordan Scott that position (point guard) quite yet. But I liked it, he's been phenomenal. He's so unentitled. There is no entitlement in Jordan Scott.\"\n\n\"Jordan Scott has a sense of urgency and purpose that is far beyond his years.\"\n\n\"We think the guy that can take two more steps is Coen Carr. He can step, he can slash, he is so athletic. Making more shots, he has worked so hard at that this year.\"\n\n\"We did some really good things, we did some bone-headed things, we need to clean up the bone-headed things, do more of the really good things.\"\n\n\"I brought in Kur, Denham, those five guys. I said Kur and Cam Ward , we need them to step up three steps. We get Cam going a little more each day, he gives us a dimension that the other bigs don't have, with that athleticism.\"\n\n\"At the end, I thought our fans and the student section did a great job. When a guy comes back, they can be real jerks. I thought he (Booker) didn't deserve that. Give him credit, give our fans credit.\"\n\nContact/Follow us @The SpartansWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Michigan State news, notes and opinion.

While Goldschmidt isn’t what he once was at this stage of his career, neither is Castellanos, and Goldschmidt doesn’t come with the attitude that the former Phillies outfielder does.\n\nWhile Castellanos’ power profile may have intrigued the Yankees on paper, there’s not much to say about him at this stage of his career. He also wasn’t content with his role and that’s something the Yankees shouldn’t have wanted to deal with.\n\n\"A lot of times when a good player has their role change with the club, it can cause some friction, and his role changed last year from where it was,\" Dave Dombrowski said. \"I mean you played every single day for a lot years in a row, and so sometimes that can contribute to it.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nSpring Training check-ins are underway across camp, and New York Yankees manager Aaron Boone offered an encouraging early update on slugger Giancarlo Stanton.\n\nSpeaking with reporters, including Randy Miller of NJ.com, Boone had very promising words to say about Stanton, who has dealt with many injuries throughout his time in the Bronx.\n\n“I think he’s doing great,” Boone said of Stanton. “I haven’t seen him yet. He’s one of the guys that will get here. But he’s had a good winter. He’s ready to roll.”\n\nStanton’s health has been a recurring storyline in recent seasons, making any positive offseason news a good thing as the Yankees prepare for the regular season.\n\nBoone also made it clear that, even with Stanton feeling well, the team will stick to its usual approach early in camp and try not to overdo it.\n\n“I don’t expect any limitations. I usually slow-play him into games in spring, so you might not see him that first week.”\n\nThat ramp-up stuff has been normal for Stanton, as it allows him to build himself up without getting hurt doing something that’s ultimately useless.\n\nIf the early outlook continues on, the Yankees could enter the season with one of their top power bats fully available, a key factor for a lineup looking to not only score a lot of runs, but also hit home runs and win the American League.\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies almost got bailed out of Nick Castellanos situation by historic team in American League\n\nNew York Yankees almost made a $20 million mistake but decided to sign Paul Goldschmidt instead\n\nBoston Red Sox trade idea finally moves on from Triston Casas after two years of rumors\n\nNew York Yankees trade proposal sends Anthony Volpe to lousy NL team for 25-year-old All-Star shortstop\n\nNew York Yankees trade pitch lands another proven veteran and the price is cheaper than most would think\n\nAtlanta Braves trade proposal swaps Ozzie Albies with best hitter at position in Major League Baseball",

ON APPLE & GOOGLE PLAY\n\n(Photo by Carl Recine/Getty Images)\n\nIn the meantime, Maguire actually rebuffed a mid-season approach from AC Milan last month, making it clear that his desire was to stay at Old Trafford and extend his stay beyond the seven-year mark.\n\nHe has enjoyed a prominent role under Michael Carrick thus far, having started every game since the former Red took the reins.\n\nThe impending return of Matthijs de Ligt following his lengthy injury layoff does prompt uncertainty over who will partner Lisandro Martinez until May – though if Carrick’s early management showings are anything to go by, he operates with a philosophy of ‘if it isn’t broke, don’t fix it’.\n\nCarrick has made only one change to his starting XI thus far, and it’s one he was forced into after Patrick Dorgu suffered a hamstring problem in the win over Arsenal.\n\nWhile Martinez and Maguire are putting in such stalwart shifts at the back, it isn’t worth intervening and potentially messing up such a dynamic pairing.\n\n(Photo by Alex Livesey/Getty Images)\n\nUnited’s No.5 isn’t the only one who’s out of contract this summer, either.\n\nCasemiro has already confirmed that he’ll be bidding farewell to the club in June – much to fans’ dismay.\n\nTom Heaton is expected to be offered another short-term deal; even though he hasn’t played in a competitive match since February 2023, the hierarchy believes it’s worth keeping him amongst the squad for his influence on the younger players and goalkeeping unit.\n\nJadon Sancho, currently on loan with Aston Villa, and Tyrell Malacia will be departing as free agents.\n\nMail: Man Utd ‘trying to negotiate’ financial terms with player who turned down AC Milan to play at Old Trafford this year\n\n“As impressive as Lammens” – Man Utd plan to add ‘outrageous’ goalkeeper to their ranks\n\nEuro outfit making ‘significant strides’ in pursuit of 27-y/o Man Utd wantaway after INEOS blocked January move",

    "fullText": "Shedeur Sanders gets interesting Cleveland Browns update after team decided to hire Todd Monken originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nQuarterback development will be the talk of the offseason for the Cleveland Browns under new head coach Todd Monken, especially with all of the options the Browns can go with. The Browns had multiple quarterbacks under center a year ago, and none of them did the job.\n\nDaniel Oyefusi of ESPN highlighted how Shedeur Sanders will factor into Cleveland’s offensive future, even if his rookie season didn’t go as planned.\n\nEven with the organization evaluating the position in the draft, Monken’s hiring was tied in part to his impressive quarterback history.\n\n“Even as general manager Andrew Berry had said that Cleveland would explore its quarterback options this offseason, part of Monken's appeal was his ability to work with the team's current group of quarterbacks – Sanders, Deshaun Watson and Dillon Gabriel – and meld his scheme to their differing skill sets,” Oyefusi wrote.\n\nFor Sanders, this should offer him an opportunity to develop in a system fixed to maximize his strengths rather than dealing with what he had to do last year. It’s also important to bring up the fact that Cleveland needs more talent around any option, so that needs to be a priority this summer.\n\nSanders was OK at times in his rookie season, but far from good. He has a lot to learn and will have an easier time doing so if he can get up to speed and have a better coach.\n\nNew Browns DC Mike Rutenberg's mentors can't help but rave about him\n\nBrowns head coach Todd Monken reveals honest opinion on Deshaun Watson\n\nBrowns' free agent Pro Bowler says goodbye to Cleveland in emotional message\n\nMyles Garrett just accomplished something no one's done since J.J.

Bayern acquired the signing of the season so far from Liverpool, a club that ended up signing Bayern’s long-term transfer target Florian Wirtz.\n\nFunny how things play out sometimes.\n\nIn a Sky Germany interview with Kerry Hau (as captured by @iMiaSanMia), Diaz surmised things worked out the way they did for a reason.\n\n“There must have been reasons why Florian didn’t come here in the end. Now I’m here, and thank God things turned out this way. I’m very happy and grateful,” Díaz said.\n\nDíaz has 19 goals and 15 assists across all competitions for Bayern Munich this season. And we are in February. Florian Wirtz, a superb player in his own right, has six goals and eight assists across all competitions for Liverpool.",

When you face teams with a solid and strong defense, it’s difficult to score against them.”\n\nFinally, the winger emphasized the coaching staff’s contribution to managing the match: “But the coach did well to find the equalizer with his substitutions.”",

This from Mourinho?\n\nIn addition to the racism issue, Mourinho also accused the referee of holding a note stating that Real Madrid players at risk of missing the second leg could not be shown a card.\n\nThe incidents overshadowed a terrific, pulsating game of football, set perfectly after their group-stage encounter.",

    "fullText": "Braves' Alex Anthopoulos blasted for letting $22M Cy Young arm go amid Spencer Schwellenbach injury originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Atlanta Braves are hoping for a bounce-back season after a disappointing 2025 campaign. However, injuries are already beginning to pile up in the starting rotation, mirroring what plagued the team last year. The domino effect began when it was announced that starter Spencer Schwellenbach was injured.\n\n“The Braves opened camp this morning with an unwelcome update on talented young righty Spencer Schwellenbach. He’s been placed on the 60-day injured list due to inflammation in his right elbow, per Mark Bowman of MLB.com. The team’s hope is that the 25-year-old is dealing with bone spurs and not something more nefarious,” MLB Trade Rumors’ Steve Adams wrote.\n\nStill, there were arms on the market for Braves GM Alex Anthopoulos to pursue. One notable option was Zac Gallen, but he ultimately re-signed with the Arizona Diamondbacks.\n\n“Zac Gallen returns to the Diamondbacks on a 1-year, $22.025 million contract with $14 million deferred after market craters,” Bob Nightengale wrote.\n\nFanSided’s Zachary Rotman believes Atlanta letting Gallen walk is a major reason why the Braves can’t be taken seriously as a contender in 2026.\n\n“The durability concerns with Atlanta's rotation are impossible to ignore, and while the team has some depth, it's clear the Braves need more than they have. Gallen was the last really interesting starter left on the free agency market. Perhaps the Braves will pivot to a guy like Lucas Giolito who won't cost as much money and won't require the forfiture of any draft capital, but until they actually add meaningful starting pitching depth, it's easy to criticize Alex Anthopoulos for not taking advantage of a suppressed Gallen market,” Rotman wrote.\n\nLetting Gallen walk in free agency without putting up much of a fight doesn’t make a lot of sense when evaluating the Braves’ roster. Atlanta addressed most of its needs this winter — except starting pitching.\n\nIf the Braves get off to a slow start because of their rotation, it will be easy to point the finger at allowing a player like Gallen to leave. At the end of the day, it’s difficult to justify not aggressively pursuing a promising arm given the team’s current situation.",

BYU hadn’t had much better success of late, having lost three of its last\n\nfour contests and sliding into 11th place in the conference.\n\n“There’s a clear recipe out there against us right now,” BYU coach Lee Cummard said.\n\n“Drive us, rebound against us, and try to speed (us) up and force turnovers. And that kind of just leads to a good recipe for the other team and not so much for us and that’s what happened today.”\n\nThe Cougars gave up 20 offensive rebounds on the night, despite their best efforts to\n\nmake that a focus coming into the contest.\n\n“Rebounding was number one on our game plan … as we came into this game,”\n\nCummard said. “To give up 20 offensive rebounds, we got to just own it. Credit to them.”\n\nTurnovers, too, have been a common denominator in the Cougars’ struggles, giving up the\n\nball 19 times in each of its last three losses.\n\n“It’s a thing that’s really kind of hindered us most of the season that we have to improve\n\non,” Cummard said. “We just got to grow from it.”\n\nThe Bearcats, on the other hand, showed few signs of struggle at the\n\nbeginning of the game, scoring 26 of their 29 first-quarter points in the initial 6:26 and putting\n\nBYU in a deficit of 11. The Cougars responded, scoring 10 points in less than two minutes\n\nto cut the score to four by the quarter’s end.\n\nBoth teams cooled off a bit in the second quarter, both scoring just 11 points in the period\n\nafter their initial offensive outburst.\n\nThe Cougars tied the game by the end of the third, going into the final 10 minutes\n\nBYU took a 62-65 lead on a made 3-pointer from sophomore guard Delaney Gibb\n\nwith 4:07 left in the game before Cincinnati slammed the door shut, outscoring the Cougars by\n\nThe Bearcats’ run was ignited by a made three to tie the score from senior guard Mya\n\nPerry, who finished the night with a game-high 32 points.\n\n“No surprise that Mya Perry showed up big time for us,” Merriweather said. “We’ve seen\n\nher do some incredible things. She’s a big-time shot maker. … I think she’s one of the best\n\noffensive guards in the country.”\n\nBYU learned that the hard way. Cincinnati, meanwhile, couldn’t have enjoyed their trip to\n\n“We’re staying in a great place,” Merriweather said. “The kids are looking at mountains. I\n\nmean … they probably felt like they were on a little bit of a vacation. … So sometimes things\n\njust roll your way and I feel like that played a big part into what happened tonight.”\n\nBYU will try to get things rolling back its way in a road matchup against Utah Saturday.\n\nThe Cougars and the Utes met in Provo earlier this year, with the home squad earning a 12-point\n\nwin. Saturday’s contest will begin at 2:00 p.m.",

    "description": "Wales centre Joe Hawkins ready to go toe-to-toe with Scotland's Lions in the Six Nations at Principality Stadium.",
    "fullText": "When Joe Hawkins agreed to return to Wales last summer it was for moments like this coming Saturday, when he could lock horns with a trio of Scottish Lions at Principality Stadium.\n\nThe 23-year-old Scarlets centre won his eighth cap in Sunday's defeat by France in Cardiff.\n\nIt was Hawkins' first Six Nations appearance since the 2023 win against Italy in Rome, the last time Wales enjoyed a victory in the championship.\n\nThe centre moved from Ospreys to Exeter at the end of that season and fell victim of the Welsh Rugby Union's cap selection policy.\n\n\"A big part in me coming back to Wales was to try and be part of the Welsh squad and to play in competitions like this,\" said Hawkins, who missed the 2023 World Cup after his move to the Chiefs.\n\n\"I don't think there is a better international competition than the Six Nations. It's amazing being back involved.\"\n\nWales 'can't cut corners' in losing streak - Wilson\n\nWales to face Fiji at Cardiff City Stadium\n\nTandy 'needs help' - Wales' hunt for defence coach\n\nHawkins returned to Wales with Scarlets last year and started against New Zealand and South Africa in the autumn.\n\nAfter being preferred to Cardiff's Ben Thomas against France last weekend, he lined up in between fly-half Dan Edwards and outside centre Eddie James for the first time at international level.\n\nThe trio, who have a total of 23 caps, could now face a well-oiled Scotland trio of Finn Russell, Sione Tuipulotu and Huw Jones.\n\nThey toured Australia with the British and Irish Lions last summer – joining forces in the XV in the first Test – and have a combined tally of 186 international outings for Scotland.\n\nFrance caused Wales all manner of problems with ball in hand and another tough defensive examination is coming.\n\n\"They've got quite a settled centre partnership, so whoever gets the chance this is a good test,\" said Hawkins.\n\n\"Tuipulotu's obviously a powerful ball carrier, but he's got nice subtle skills as well. Huw Jones has got a bit of gas and some nice running lines, so they complement each other well.\"\n\nThe Glasgow combination could be going up against a Scarlets duo if Hawkins and James hold off the challenge of Thomas and fit-again Ospreys centre Owen Watkin.\n\nJames, 23 and 6ft 3ins, showed signs of promise with ball in hand against Les Bleus.\n\n\"He had an injury during the off season and since he has come back for the Scarlets he has been really physical in the carry and in defence,\" said Hawkins, who also partnered James for Wales Under-20s.\n\n\"He has brought that into the Six Nations and he is a big man. When you've got people like that in the team you just want to get them on the ball as much as possible.\"\n\nAfter shipping 15 tries and 102 points in the first two rounds, Wales clearly have work to do in defence.\n\nHowever, Hawkins' playmaking abilities are key to them also posing more questions in attack.\n\n\"We talk a lot about being a team that can excite the nation,\" said the centre, who featured at fly-half for Scarlets in the first half of the season.\n\n\"A lot of the best teams in the world believe in their style of game and wouldn't change. France double down on that and they are one of the best in the world.\n\n\"After a couple of disappointing results it's not the time to go away from what is working, or going to work, for us moving forward. We just need to keep banging the drum.\"",

(Photo by Mike Hewitt/Getty Images)\n\nThe attacker has now scored ten league goals, to match his tally at Brighton from last season, and is thriving under the 41-year-old.\n\nRosenior has praised Pedro on numerous occasions since he arrived, and Law has revealed the new head coach met with the 24-year-old more than any other player.\n\n“He [Rosenior] met with Joao Pedro more than any other player,” he told The London Is Blue Podcast.\n\n“I Always thought Maresca talked him down as a nine, maybe that impacted him.\n\n“Rosenior seems to really talk him up as a nine.

    "fullText": "For a long while, digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) cameras were the king of the castle for professional and amateur photography. They brought large sensors, interchangeable lenses, and professional-level viewfinders to the digital world at approachable prices, and then cemented their lead when they started being used to create video as well. They’re experiencing a bit of a decline now, though, as mirrorless cameras start to dominate, and with that comes some unique opportunities. To attach a lens meant for a DSLR to a mirrorless camera, an adapter housing must be used, and [Ancient] found a way to squeeze a computer and a programmable aperture into this tiny space.\n\nThe programmable aperture is based on an LCD screen from an old cell phone. LCD screens are generally transparent until their pixels are switched, and in most uses as displays a backer is put in place so someone can make out what is on the screen. [Ancient] is removing this backer, though, allowing the LCD to be completely transparent when switched off. The screen is placed inside this lens adapter housing in the middle of a PCB where a small computer is also placed. The computer controls the LCD via a set of buttons on the outside of the housing, allowing the photographer to use this screen as a programmable aperture.\n\nThe LCD-as-aperture has a number of interesting uses that would be impossible with a standard iris aperture. Not only can it function as a standard iris aperture, but it can do things like cycle through different areas of the image in sequence, open up arbitrary parts or close off others, and a number of other unique options. It’s worth checking out the video below, as [Ancient] demonstrates many of these effects towards the end. We’ve seen some of these effects before, although those were in lenses that were mechanically controlled instead.\n\nThanks to [kemfic] for the tip!",

    "fullText": "Freshly released documents tied to Jeffrey Epstein are raising new and unsettling questions.\n\nIn the latest batch of released Epstein Files, uncovered emails per TMZ show Epstein asking about his “trumpet plants at nursery.” While the reference might have seemed harmless—experts noted that Angel’s Trumpet plants are extremely toxic and produce a drug called scopolamine.\n\nScopolamine has gained notoriety for its disturbing effects. Per Science Direct, the substance is known to impair memory and decision-making, and severe intoxication reportedly may even cause paralysis and death. “In cases of overdose, result in toxic symptoms such as dry mucous membranes, tachycardia, confusion, and hallucinations,” the outlet states.\n\nNotably, the drug is used pharmacologically—though rarely—to treat motion sickness and nausea. But perhaps most alarming, scopolamine reportedly doesn't show up on toxicology reports.\n\nAccording to the document release, Epstein also received an article detailing the effects of scopolamine and the plant it comes from, suggesting he may have been aware of its properties.\n\nEpstein died in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges. Since then, court-ordered releases of documents have continued in waves. Lawmakers voted to force President Donald Trump’s Department of Justice to publicly release the Epstein Files, though the DOJ has indicated there are no further batches expected.\n\nThe broader files have drawn attention not only for their contents, but for the high-profile names mentioned throughout—including figures such as Elon Musk, Deepak Chopra, and Bill Gates, among other prominent individuals in business and entertainment.\n\nAnd just last week, Epstein’s former associate Ghislaine Maxwellinvoked the Fifth Amendment during a deposition before the House Oversight Committee when asked about associations involving Trump and Epstein. At this time, Trump has not been accused of any crime in relation to Epstein.",

    "fullText": "New Jersey's acting attorney general said Tuesday she will not ask the state Supreme Court to review the dismissal of racketeering charges against Democratic power broker George E. Norcross III and those charged alongside him.\n\nThe decision by Jennifer Davenport, who was recently appointed by new Gov. Mikie Sherrill, came nearly three weeks after a three-judge appellate panel upheld a state judge's decision to toss the criminal charges. The indictment had been obtained by Matt Platkin, who served as attorney general under Sherrill's predecessor and fellow Democrat Phil Murphy.\n\n“In light of the Appellate Division’s decision, we have concluded that our prosecutorial resources would be best spent on other matters,\" the attorney general's office said in a statement. “Our office remains committed to prioritizing public corruption prosecutions in this time of deepening mistrust in government.”\n\nThe charges stemmed from a June 2024 indictment announced by Platkin at a news conference at which Norcross himself took the unusual step of appearing in person and sitting directly in front of the attorney general.\n\nNorcross and five other defendants were accused of running “an enterprise” going back to 2012 to use their political influence to craft legislation to serve their own interests. But in a nearly 100-page ruling, the state judge found the prosecution’s allegations did not amount to criminal coercion or extortion and are time-barred.\n\nNorcross and his lawyers have long maintained his innocence, claiming the indictment was politically motivated, an allegation Platkin has repeatedly denied.\n\nNorcross, who served as executive chairman of the insurance firm Conner Strong & Buckelew, has been widely viewed as among the most influential unelected Democrats in the state. He was a Democratic National Committee member until 2021 and previously served as the head of the Camden County Democratic Party.",

    "fullText": "BOWIE (KFDX/KJTL) — After a school board meeting, Bowie Independent School District will continue allowing transfers of students amongst neighboring school districts.\n\nAt the Bowie ISD School Board meeting on Monday, Feb. 16, parents voiced their opinions on the state of the district, citing concerns ranging from district performance to student safety. Parents said their concerns caused them to remove their children from Bowie schools altogether.\n\nParents have had the right to decide if they wanted their children to attend one of the four neighboring districts, despite where they reside. If accepted by that school, a bus would travel into Bowie to pick the child up.\n\nThe board had previously said they might no longer allow buses from other districts to travel into Bowie’s district, sparking a public outcry that came to a head at Monday’s school board meeting.\n\nTexas Top 10 Most Wanted offender captured in Bowie\n\nThe meeting was packed, with multiple parents sharing their reasons for removing their children from the district.\n\nAmong the biggest concerns raised was bullying, and Bowie parent Michelle Parker expressed her frustration during the public comment section of the meeting.\n\n“My daughter was being bullied on a daily [basis], and the teachers, the principal, the superintendent would not listen. I was going to them. I was talking to them. I was making the phone calls. I was being the active parent, and they did not listen,” Parker said. “They didn’t hear a word I said. My daughter was literally dragged down the bleachers by her hoodie, and the only excuse I got was because the boys were bored.”\n\nParker told board members after trying the get the issue resolved and feeling ignored, she felt the only option was to have her child transfer schools. She said after speaking with other families, she learned her experience is not isolated.\n\n“We choose to take our kids somewhere else because we as parents want what’s best for our kids. They don’t address what’s important for our kids. They’re not addressing the bullying that’s going on in schools,” Parker said. “Those of us parents who have gone up the ladder to try to address it have been completely ignored. They don’t listen.”\n\nBen Franklin Elementary plans centennial celebration event\n\nAfter hearing public comments, the board voted to enter an interlocal bussing agreement with four surrounding school districts, continuing to allow those districts to pick up Bowie area students who voluntarily enroll elsewhere.\n\n“I was elected to look after the needs of every student. I understand that in today’s society, parents have the right to send their child wherever they want to, and I respect that,” Bowie ISD Board member Jeff Jackson said. “However, once a student chooses to attend another school, I as a trustee, and we as a board no longer have an obligation to them. Our obligation is to the students who want to attend Bowie schools.”\n\nDistrict leaders said they acknowledge parent concerns and say improving student experiences remains a priority.\n\nThe districts that are set to be included in the agreement are Goldberg, Montague, Forestburg and Bellevue ISD. Details of the interlocal agreements still have to be finalized.\n\nYou can now stream KFDX and Texoma’s FOX live 24/7 on your smart TV with KFDX+, our brand-new app!

    "fullText": "It is unknown whether the Burbank Police Department expected such a reaction to one of its recent Instagram posts, but it sure has taken off.\n\nBPD posted on Feb. 13 a photo of a member of their ranks, Officer Parks, after he encountered a pair of French Bulldogs during a call for service.\n\n“He could not resist petting, holding and snapping a photo with them!” the department said in the post’s caption. “Police officers love dogs.”\n\nWhat started as a routine cute photo-op quickly became something else, however, as social media users flocked to the comment section not to comment on the Frenchies – one being held by Officer Parks and the other appearing to relieve itself behind him – but to comment on Officer Parks himself.\n\nThe post, as of Tuesday morning, sat at over 200,000 likes. For context, the BPD Instagram post before the one with Officer Parks – a job posting – got less than 100. Over 3,000 people commented on the post, mostly on Officer Parks’ looks.\n\nThe most-liked ones were quite creative:\n\n“I just lost my dogs in Burbank requesting Officer Parks’ help,” one person said.\n\n“Is Officer Parks available for a completely professional, absolutely necessary pat-down?” another asked.\n\n“I identify as a dog if Officer park wants to pick me up too,” said a third.\n\nSome even went as far as to accuse themselves of (hopefully) fake crimes in the hopes Officer Parks would respond.\n\n“I stole $2,000 worth of items from Target. I dare you to arrest me I’m in the parking lot by the 3rd light post towards the back next to the black Honda,” a user quipped.\n\n“I committed a crime, please come arrest me,” said another.\n\nSome users opted for other humorous comments.\n\n“Ain’t nobody looking at that cat,” said one person.\n\n“Nah y’all wrong for dropping his name but not his number,” said another.\n\nThe police department clearly noticed the virality, liking some of the comments pertaining to Officer Parks’ looks — including “This cop out here servin’ the people AND servin’ looks!” and “Ooof he has handcuffs” — and another posted by a user who said the comment section had them “in freaking tears.”\n\nIt was not immediately clear what Officer Parks thought of the messages.",

    "fullText": "CORTINA D'AMPEZZO, Italy (AP) — Team USA skiers Lindsey Vonn and Mikaela Shiffrin, along with Italy's Federica Brignone, are among the many skiers who have expressed concern during these Olympic Games about the accelerating melt of the world’s glaciers.\n\nAnd Olympic host city Cortina is a fitting place for them to be talking about climate change: Glaciers once visible from town have dramatically shrunk. Many have been reduced to tiny glaciers or residual ice patches at high elevations among the jagged peaks of the Dolomites. Any Olympian or spectator wishing to lay eyes on a major glacier would have to take a long drive on winding mountain roads to the Marmolada. It's melting rapidly, too.\n\nThe world’s top skiers train on glaciers because of the high-quality snow there, and a warming world jeopardizes the future of their sport. Vonn started skiing on glaciers in Austria when she was just 9 years old.\n\n“Most of the glaciers that I used to ski on are pretty much gone,” 41-year-old Vonn said Feb. 3 in response to a question from The Associated Press at a prerace press conference in Cortina before she crashed on the Olympic downhill course. “So that’s very real and it’s very apparent to us.”\n\nAs athletes in snow sports, Shiffrin said, they “get a real front-row view” to the monumental changes underway atop some of the world’s highest, coldest peaks.\n\n“It is something that’s very close to our heart, because it is the heart and soul of what we do,” Shiffrin told AP after racing Sunday. “I would really, really like to believe and hope that with strong voices and sort of broader policy changes within companies and governments, there is a hope for a future of our sport. But I think right now, it’s a little bit of a ... it’s a question.”\n\nItalian glaciologist Antonella Senese said Italy has lost more than 200 square kilometers (77 square miles) of glacier area since the late 1950s.\n\n“We are observing a continuous and uninterrupted decrease in glacier area and volume. In the last one to two decades, this reduction has clearly accelerated,” Senese, associate professor of physical geography in the University of Milan's environmental science and policy department, said in an interview.\n\nAmong the peaks surrounding Cortina d’Ampezzo, there are glaciers on the slopes of the Cristallo and Sorapiss mountains. The 2015 New Italian Glacier Inventory found these glaciers shrunk by about one-third since the 1959-1962 inventory.\n\nShortly after winning a second gold Sunday at her home Winter Olympics, Brignone told AP that skiing is “totally different” now than when she was younger. Brignone lives in the Valle d’Aosta, about six hours away.\n\nWhen she sees how glaciers are retreating to higher elevations, Brignone said she’s not thinking about the future of skiing — she’s concerned for the future of the planet.\n\n“There we have a lot of glaciers, but they are going up and up, every year, more and more,” she told AP.\n\nYet many people who don't frequent the mountains remain unaware of what's at stake, so the University of Innsbruck created the Goodbye Glaciers Project. The loss of glaciers has far-reaching consequences, threatening water sources, increasing mountain hazards and contributing to sea level rise.\n\nThe project shows how different warming levels change the amount of ice left on selected glaciers around the world. To be included, glaciers must have an estimated 2020 volume of at least 0.01 cubic kilometers. The Cristallo and Sorapiss glaciers no longer meet that threshold, said Patrick Schmitt, a doctoral student at the University of Innsbruck.\n\nSome 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Cortina is the Marmolada glacier, one of the largest glaciers in Italy and the largest in the Dolomites. An apartment building-sized chunk of the glacier detached in July 2022, sparking an avalanche of debris that killed 11 hikers. The mountain is popular for hiking in summer and skiing in winter.\n\nThe University of Padua said in 2023 the glacier had been halved over 25 years.\n\nIt's expected to be mostly gone by 2034 if the world warms 2.7 Celsius (4.9 Fahrenheit), according to the Goodbye Glaciers Project. But if warming is limited to 1.5 C (2.7 F — the international goal — the glacier’s life could be extended by another six years, and around 100 glaciers in the Alps can be saved, Schmitt said.\n\n“Cutting greenhouse gas emissions now will reduce future ice loss and soften the impacts on people and nature,” Schmitt wrote in an email. “The choices we make in this decade will decide how much ice remains in the Dolomites, across the Alps, and around the world.”\n\nGlobally, more than 7 trillion tons of ice (6.5 trillion metric tons) has been lost since 2000, according to a study last year. And the prospective impact of climate change on Olympic sport is enormous; the list of places that could host Winter Games is projected to shrink substantially in the coming years.\n\nIn Cortina, Noa Szollos, who is competing for Israel, said in an interview the state of the nearby glaciers speaks to the condition of glaciers around the world.\n\n“I hope we can do something about it,” she said, “but it’s a hard time.”\n\nSilja Koskinen of Finland said in an interview she can’t train on some of the glaciers she used to because of crevices, rocks and flowing water. Team USA skier AJ Hurt talked about starting the season in October on glaciers in Sölden, Austria.\n\n“Every year, I feel like we come and there’s a little less snow. And every time, we’re like, are we really going to start in October? There’s no snow here,'” Hurt told the AP. “It is really sad and it’s hard to ignore in this sport, definitely, when we’re around it so much and it is so clear.”\n\nNorwegian skier Nikolai Schirmer is leading an effort to stop fossil fuel companies from sponsoring winter sports. Burning coal, oil and gas is the largest contributor to global climate change by far.\n\nIn Bormio, Italy, Team USA skier River Radamus said athletes — as stewards of outdoor winter sports— should be on the forefront of trying to defend the environment as best they can.\n\n“It’s always present in our mind that we’re on a dangerous trend unless we do something right,” Radamus said.\n\nAP Sports Writer Pat Graham contributed from Bormio, Italy.\n\nAP Winter Olympics coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics\n\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

    "fullText": "Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) on Tuesday questioned why President Trump and other GOP lawmakers haven’t locked down the Texas Senate race with an endorsement in the three-way party primary. \n\nSen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) and Rep. Wesley Hunt (R-Texas) are vying for Cornyn’s seat in the Senate. The frequently nasty battle between Paxton and Cornyn has left some Democrats thinking it could create an opening for their party in November, particularly if Paxton wins.\n\nFetterman said he thinks his party can regain the House but argued the battle to retake the Senate majority will be an uphill one during an appearance on Fox Business Network’s “Mornings with Maria.”\n\nHe also argued that Trump and the GOP are putting Texas in play by not backing Cornyn.\n\n“I mean, as you point out, the margin is very close. And there’s always — history always tells us there’s a backlash against the party in power. … So I think most people would have assumed that the House is going to flip. Now, here in the Senate, that’s a little more difficult, and now you have other races in play,” he told host Maria Bartiromo.\n\n“For me, like for Texas, for example, Cornyn is a reasonable Republican, and now that would be money in the bank. But now I don’t know why politically — I’m not sure why the Republicans and the president wouldn’t sit on that and just lock down Texas. But for me, there’s other states that are in flux,” he added.\n\nDemocrats are having their own contentious primary in Texas between Rep. Jasmine Crockett and state Rep. James Talarico.\n\nFetterman has shared a dismal outlook on his party. On Tuesday, the Pennsylvania senator said Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.) is “part of the rot in the Democratic Party” for her foreign policy stance denouncing Israel amid the war in Gaza.\n\n“For me, stand with Israel. I’ll never vote for any kinds of restrictions on aid, whether it’s military, financial, or intelligence. There are never to be any restrictions on that. And now, for here we are, we can have peace. Again, that’s become part of the serious problem in our party,” Fetterman told Bartiromo.\n\nHe later added, “I refuse to pander to the part of my Democratic Party that finds that there’s value in being anti-Israel. And that’s effectively — they use the word ‘anti-Zionism’ — I mean, effectively what that’s really become on college campuses and places is just antisemitism. We have a problem here in our party, and I’m going to stand against that and always be an unapologetic supporter for Israel.”",

    "fullText": "Another well-known Milwaukee bar and restaurant is facing a federal lawsuit over tipping practices an employee says violated the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n\nSteny's Tavern and Grill, doing business as Steny's, Inc., and its registered agent Jerome K. Stenstrup are named in the civil complaint filed by Nathan Witman, a Steny's front-of-house employee. The lawsuit was filed Feb. 12 in the Eastern District of Wisconsin.\n\nThe suit alleges Steny's, 800 S. 2nd St., operates an unlawful mandatory tip pool that includes kitchen workers, who do not customarily receive tips, and wrongfully claimed a tip credit it was not entitled to receive.\n\nMore: Cafe Corazon employees sue restaurant over tip pooling policy that included managers\n\nA tip credit is a provision under the Fair Labor Standards Act that allows an employer to count a portion of a tipped employee's tips towards the employer's obligation to pay that employee per workweek an amount equal to the minimum wage and overtime compensation required under the FLSA. In Wisconsin, the minimum wage is $7.25.\n\nWitman is one of at least 40 employees affected by the tip pool, the lawsuit says.\n\nStenstrup did not immediately return a message seeking comment on the lawsuit. Steny's operates two locations, the Walker's Point restaurant named in the suit and a location in Pewaukee.\n\nA similar lawsuit alleging illegal tipping practices at the St. Paul Fish Company's Milwaukee Public Market location was filed in January. That suit claims the seafood restaurant illegally allowed its managers to take tips set aside for other restaurant workers.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Milwaukee bar Steny's accused of illegal tipping practices in lawsuit",

    "fullText": "Tesla says its purpose-built robotaxi just reached an important manufacturing milestone.\n\nIn an X post on Tuesday, the company said the Cybercab, a two-door car without a steering wheel, came off the production line at Tesla's sprawling Gigafactory in Austin.\n\n\"Congratulations to the Tesla team on making the first production Cybercab!\" Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on X.\n\nThe Cybercab was designed for Tesla's nascent robotaxi ride-hailing program.\n\nTesla's robotaxi program has so far deployed only 2025 Model Ys and mostly relies on human safety monitors to supervise rides. Tesla began offering a limited number of unsupervised rides to the public in January.\n\nUnlike the Model Y, the Cybercab doesn't have a steering wheel or pedals — it's intended to be fully autonomous. Amazon's Zoox similarly manufactures purpose-built robotaxis designed solely to transport passengers.\n\nTesla has said it expects to start production of the Cybercab in April.\n\nWhat's less clear is the timeline for when the automaker expects the Cybercab to be fully street legal.\n\nFederal vehicle safety standards were written with human control systems like a steering wheel in mind, which means Tesla would likely need special approval from regulators for any requirements it can't meet. Notably, Zoox received such a federal exemption and now operates a limited public service in Las Vegas and San Francisco.\n\nMusk also said people will have the option to buy the car. Selling a car without pedals or steering controls not only requires clearing federal regulatory hurdles but could also expose Tesla to a patchwork of state-by-state rules governing registration, insurance, and autonomous vehicle operation.\n\n\"What we designed is optimized for autonomy,\" Musk said during an earnings call in October 2024. \"It will cost on the order of — cost roughly 25K, so it is a 25K car. And you can, you will be able to buy one exclusively if you want.\"\n\nA Tesla spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "description": "Rev. Jesse Jackson took a chance on Bradley Akubuiro when he was a 19-year-old college student. They stayed close over the years.",
    "fullText": "Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr. took a chance on me as a 19-year-old college student.\n\nAt that age, as an intern in 2009, I should've been pouring coffee, maybe making copies. Instead, he put me to work on college affordability policy, youth violence prevention, and immigration reform at his Rainbow PUSH (People United to Serve Humanity) Coalition on the South Side of Chicago.\n\nThat was nearly two decades ago. This week, he passed away.\n\nA few weeks ago, I sat with him in the hospital. He was extremely present even as Progressive Supranuclear Palsy disorder had taken his voice — the same instrument that had formed seemingly impossible coalitions and made the moral case for justice in language that brought people together instead of tearing them apart.\n\nI met him in 2009 at a press conference he held to announce his intention to negotiate the release of journalist Roxana Saberi from an Iranian prison.\n\nSaberi was an alum of Northwestern University, where I was a student. Several classmates and I had staged a rally to call attention to her issue, and Rev. Jackson had invited us to join him at his press conference in Chicago.\n\nWhen it ended and everyone packed up to leave, I made a split-second decision.\n\nI grabbed him by the shoulder — strongly enough that his security detail sprang into action — and asked if I could volunteer for his Reduce-the-Rate initiative on college affordability. It was an issue that deeply resonated with me, as I'd borrowed a crippling amount to attend Northwestern. He said yes.\n\nThat moment changed everything. Less than a month later, I became the campaign's manager, working part-time during school. I handled policy research and community interface and accompanied Rev. Jackson to meetings and events. I spent time with him every week and at times even did my homework at his house.\n\nHe became a mentor, coaching me and looking out for me not only professionally, but personally. I left the role in 2011, but over the years, we stayed close.\n\nFrom Rev. Jackson, I learned three lessons about leadership that have shaped everything I've done since.\n\nRev. Jackson had a pattern: When things got difficult, he moved closer to the problem, not away from it.\n\nHe negotiated the release of over 200 hostages across Syria, Cuba, Iraq, and Serbia. He flew into war zones and sat across the table from dictators. He showed up to Texaco's headquarters during their discrimination scandal. He walked into corporate boardrooms where he wasn't welcome.\n\nMany leaders I know do the opposite. When crisis hits, they create distance — delegate to lawyers, let the public relations team handle it, wait for it to blow over.\n\nRev. Jackson taught me that the moments when you want to step back are precisely when you need to step forward. Your measure as a leader is taken in the hardest moments, not the easy ones.\n\nRev. Jackson had no reason to believe in my abilities. But he understood that individuals have incredible capacity for growth — they just don't start off optimally productive.\n\nHe put a 19-year-old on policy work that mattered, then put me on-air representing the campaign. That wasn't reckless — it was intentional investment. He knew that by giving people opportunities, some would disappoint him over the years, but the ones who didn't might surpass what he could've imagined.\n\nI've carried that forward — looking for people others overlook and investing in their growth. Not everyone pans out. But the ones who do become extraordinary.\n\nReal leadership isn't about finding perfect people. It's about developing the potential in imperfect ones.\n\nRev. Jackson was simultaneously the agitator and the negotiator. The prophet and the pragmatist.\n\nHe showed up uninvited to shareholder meetings and organized boycotts, but also sat down with those same executives afterward to identify resolutions.\n\n\"Diamonds can't be produced without pressure,\" he once told me. This applies to individuals, organizations, and systems.\n\nHe understood that real change requires both confrontation and conversation. You can't just be nice and hope things improve. But you also can't only apply pressure and expect people to come around.\n\nI watched him do this with the Wall Street Project, pressuring corporations like Texaco and Coca-Cola to commit billions to diversity initiatives. He made them uncomfortable with boycotts. Then he sat down with their leadership and helped build solutions.\n\nToo many leaders think they have to choose to either be tough or be empathetic. Rev. Jackson taught me that's a false choice; the best leaders do both.\n\nRev. Jackson once told me the work of justice isn't about being comfortable. It's about being consistent. It's about showing up when it's hard, especially when staying silent would be easier.\n\nHe showed up. Consistently. The work he did — building coalitions across impossible divides, making the moral case in language that united rather than divided — we need it now more than ever.\n\nLast year, during one of my Saturday visits to Rainbow PUSH, I brought the manuscript for my book \"Faster. Messier. Tougher: Crisis Communications Strategies in an Era of Populism, AI, and Distrust.\" He saw how I was continuing on the work and agreed to put his name behind it.\n\nLast week, when I held the first copy from the printer and saw the quote from him on the front cover, it was so moving. That he could support me one last time means the world to me.\n\nI grabbed his shoulder at 19 because I didn't want to let the moment pass. He taught me to lean into hard moments, develop people others overlook, and hold the tension between conflict and conversation.\n\nThat work doesn't end with him. It's up to us to pick it up.\n\nBradley Akubuiro is a partner at Bully Pulpit International, where he advises corporate leaders like Levi Strauss and the NFL on high-visibility reputation and diversity and inclusion matters.",

    "description": "Perplexity, a San Francisco-based AI startup, emphasizes subscriptions and business sales, diverging from OpenAI's ad-centric approach.",
    "fullText": "Perplexity is going full steam ahead with subscriptions and business sales and plans to focus more on monetization than it has in the past, executives said at a roundtable with reporters on Monday.\n\nThe AI search startup, based in San Francisco, is the latest to publicly distance itself from putting ads in chatbot answers, with one executive saying it isn't exploring any ad deals at the moment. That's a contrast to OpenAI, which is going all in on ads, while arch-rival Anthropic has publicly touted the opposite.\n\nOne Perplexity executive said the startup is increasingly targeting large businesses. The company has only five people on its enterprise sales team and plans to ramp that up, the executive added. It also wants to serve high-powered users such as finance professionals, doctors, and CEOs.\n\nThe focus on selling to businesses positions Perplexity more directly as a competitor to startups like Glean, which lets employees search internal files and data more efficiently with AI.\n\nThe move comes amid some VC skepticism about Perplexity's prospects, with Silicon Valley investors voting it the company they'd most like to bet against in an informal poll at an AI conference last year, amid back-to-back funding rounds and talks of a wider AI bubble.\n\nPerplexity will focus more on revenue and revenue retention than on other metrics, such as the number of questions it answers, the executive said. Perplexity also pledged to keep allowing people to use the product for free, with rate limits.\n\nAt the roundtable, the company declined to share specific financials and shared that revenue grew 4.7 times last year. Perplexity generated over $150 million in annual recurring revenue by mid-last year, its head of communications Jesse Dwyer told Business Insider in August. It hit $200 million in ARR in October, Alex Heath of Sources reported.\n\nThe news comes after several months of the AI startup lying low, as Perplexity said in a press invite. The company's leaders said it was busy building and not focusing on AI-related drama.\n\nPerplexity had announced in 2024 that it would start experimenting with ads. That effort stalled, with the top ads leader, Taz Patel, quietly leaving last year. One consistent issue with ads in AI-generated answers is that users won't believe them, the Perplexity executive said.\n\nPerplexity also launched a product for enterprises in 2024 that uses internal and external data to generate research reports, among other features.",

    "description": "Anni Chen says vibe coding is hard to resist. It speeds up her productivity, but she doesn't trust it blindly.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Anni Chen, who has worked at Amazon for about three-and-a-half years. It has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified her employment history.\n\nI'm a tech lead at Amazon responsible for deploying large-scale generative AI and LLM-driven systems. I focus on what we call memory, which powers personalization in generative AI experiences across Amazon.\n\nI vibe code every day. It's definitely a productivity boost.\n\nFor debugging or small tasks, I sometimes treat it like a lottery. Maybe it will produce something amazing. Sometimes, it does.\n\nVibe coding helps me brainstorm what the solution could look like, even if I don't adopt the final solution it proposes. Vibe coding also speeds up the time spent rewriting code when you realize a requirement wasn't covered.\n\nWhen I vibe code, it's always iterative. I give it the basic information it needs, it produces a version, then I check it — similar to a code review with coworkers. I might say, \"You missed this part\" or \"You missed that part.\"\n\nThe AI sometimes fixes issues but introduces something new. You have to keep an eye on it.\n\nFor complex tasks, you need more double-checking. But even with the extra checking, it's still faster.\n\nI was working with a partner team and ran into complex locking issues. Without an LLM, I might have taken a day to research possible solutions, especially since it was relatively new to me.\n\nWithin 15 minutes, I brainstormed with the LLM about possible solutions. I pointed out weaknesses in its suggestions and asked it to improve them. In 15 minutes, I had a proposal to send to the team.\n\nTechnical knowledge helps — you know what's a good solution and what's not. You know what tastes good, but you don't know what dishes are available. The LLM brings up all the dishes, and you choose.\n\nStill, I'm hesitant to use vibe coding directly in production.\n\nLLMs are very good at solving problems, but sometimes they make implicit assumptions you don't realize they're making. If you don't tell it explicitly, for example, that something needs to work for multi-threading, it might just produce the minimum version that works, but when it's large-scale or productionized, it could crash.\n\nNon-technical builders could tell an LLM to build something that handles millions of users. But if you have zero technical knowledge, it's hard to anticipate constraints upfront. If you don't tell the model the implicit assumptions, it won't respect those constraints. Later, you'll run into problems.\n\nNon-technical people might use the LLM to fix issues reactively. But technical people can anticipate constraints proactively and prevent problems in the first place.\n\nTechnical people also understand vibe-coded content better, and they're in a better position to understand what LLMs are good at and not good at. For example, knowing how they're trained and why they're weaker at certain tasks like math. That understanding helps you master them as tools.\n\nWhen you scale to one million or 100 million customers, systems need to be coded differently to handle that scale.\n\nInitially, leadership pushed vibe coding. Our team is a GenAI team, so we were naturally more receptive. In non-GenAI teams, engineers initially reacted like, \"No, I won't let AI do my job. I don't trust AI-generated code.\"\n\nAfter people tried it, attitudes shifted. People realized it's pretty good sometimes. Now it's more widely adopted.\n\nIt's very hard to resist vibe coding nowadays. If you're an employee, leadership sees the productivity boost and will encourage you to use it.\n\nWhen your peers are using it and coding faster, it's hard to resist. If you can't keep up with the speed, it becomes difficult to collaborate.\n\nEven if you resist, you still consume AI passively. AI comments are embedded in code reviews. So even if you don't vibe code directly, you're still interacting with AI outputs.\n\nDo you have a story to share about vibe coding? Contact this reporter at cmlee@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "In Europe, there's been a lot of handwringing over why there are very few large, successful tech companies in the region. Peter Steinberger, the creator of the agentic AI hit OpenClaw, has an answer.\n\nSteinberger was recently hired by OpenAI and is moving from Europe to the US. An Austrian by birth, he previously split his time between London and Vienna.\n\nOn X, a professor from a European university asked why Europe couldn't retain this tech talent.\n\nSteinberger replied that most people in the US are enthusiastic, while in Europe, he's scolded about responsibility and regulations.\n\nIf he built a company in Europe, he would struggle with strict labor regulations and similar rules, he added.\n\nAt OpenAI, he said most employees work 6 to 7 days a week and are paid accordingly. In Europe, that would be illegal, he added.\n\nThe most valuable company in Europe is Dutch chip-equipment maker ASML, valued at about $550 billion. In contrast, there are 10 US companies worth more than $1 trillion. Most of these are tech companies.\n\nIn 2024, a landmark EU report found that the region had fallen behind the US, particularly in innovation. It proposed a series of changes to tackle the problem, but by the end of 2025, few of the recommendations had been implemented.\n\nSteinberger said he was hopeful about EU INC, an effort to create a single corporate legal framework to make it simpler to run a business across the region.\n\nBut this seems to be \"fizzling out,\" he wrote on X. \"Watered down, too much egoistic national interest that ultimately hurts everyone.\"\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "Ducati's top executive said he hopes he'll never see the day when motorcycles can drive themselves.\n\nJason Chinnock, who has been with the Italian luxury motorcycle company for over 20 years and served as its North American CEO for a decade, said being a motorcyclist is a core part of his identity.\n\nHe told Business Insider in an interview that a self-driving motorcycle would \"take away the entire reason to ride a motorcycle.\"\n\nAutonomous cars, he said, are useful for mobility — they transport people in a \"safe, smooth, efficient, and carefree way.\"\n\nHe said Ducati's motorcycles are less about transportation and more about entertainment and the riding experience.\n\n\"We are not building mobility. We're building motorcycles. We're building something for joy and for fun,\" Chinnock said. \"If it takes away the ability to operate it and experience it, then just get in a pod and go from point A to point B.\"\n\nThere are no commercially available self-driving motorcycles. Some companies, such as Japan's Yamaha and the Singapore-headquartered Omoway, have started work on self-balancing bikes.\n\nHowever, Ducati is not entirely dismissing autonomous features, adding them where necessary for safety. For instance, Chinnock said some of Ducati's models come with electronic cruise control, traction control, and an anti-lock braking system.\n\nDucati, which was founded in Bologna, Italy, in 1926, is owned by the Volkswagen Group.\n\nIts motorcycles cost more than $10,000 in the US, with some models exceeding $40,000. In 2024, Ducati sold about 55,000 motorcycles worldwide, earning 1 billion euros, or about $1.17 billion, in revenue.\n\nAutonomous cars are gaining traction globally.

    "description": "Lauren Rose Kocher never worked full-time in the US, so her understanding of corporate culture was formed almost entirely in Japan.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Lauren Rose Kocher, 39, an American entrepreneur and CEO of Vegas PR Group in Tokyo. Her words have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI grew up in a small town in Indiana, but my interest in Japan started early. I still remember watching a \"Sesame Street\" episode where Big Bird visits Japan. That image stuck with me.\n\nIn college, that curiosity took shape: I studied Japanese at the University of Chicago and spent a summer in Hokkaido. After graduating, I moved to Japan in 2008 to teach English, though a career in teaching was never my goal.\n\nI wanted to work for a Japanese company and use the language skills I'd built in school. I'd never worked full-time in the US, so my understanding of corporate culture has been formed almost entirely in Japan.\n\nAfter teaching, I transitioned into corporate roles in Japanese companies. I spent three years as an assistant and international concert promoter before joining Sony Music's business development division for four years. I later became the cofounder and COO of a VC-funded ticketing platform.\n\nAfter nearly a decade inside corporate Japan, I stepped into senior leadership.\n\nNow, I'm the CEO and sole founder of Vegas PR Group, a Tokyo-based marketing agency focused on culture, the arts, music, and fashion. Our bilingual team of nine works across Japanese and international clients.\n\nSince 2024, I've also overseen two businesses founded by my late husband, a sandwich restaurant and a clothing brand.\n\nI plan to stay in Japan long-term. My two children are half-Japanese, and I value raising them here.\n\nJapanese business culture relies heavily on consensus-building, often through \"nemawashi,\" the process of privately aligning stakeholders before any formal decision is announced.\n\nFeedback is similarly indirect. Japanese teams are often hesitant to raise concerns openly, which means issues can remain unspoken until they surface all at once. Decision-making is cautious and risk-averse, and change tends to be incremental rather than dramatic.\n\nI've learned to factor this into timelines, particularly when working with Japanese clients who require internal alignment before moving forward. The people I hire tend to defy that stereotype and slot easily into our open, international culture.\n\nI wouldn't say my management style is particularly American, but my American communication style and entrepreneurial instinct certainly are. I try to respect local expectations, though I know my tendency to move quickly and take decisive swings has occasionally come across as abrasive in a culture where decisions are slow, and relationships are built with great caution.\n\nBecause all of my work is rooted in the Japanese market, I encourage international staff to follow Japanese work customs when dealing with local clients, while leaving room for each person to navigate what they're personally comfortable with.\n\nPunctuality is one example. In many countries, joining a Zoom call a minute or two late is inconsequential. In Japan, it's not. Logging in at 9:01 a.m. for a 9 a.m. meeting is considered late, and I enforce that expectation.\n\nThe same applies to in-person meetings, where arriving at least 10 minutes early is standard. When doing business in Japan, being on time is non-negotiable.\n\nMy leadership philosophy is rooted in servant leadership. I'm heavily invested in the success of the people I work with, and that approach has helped me build trust across Japanese and international teams.\n\nAs a white American woman in Japan, I'm perceived first as foreign. I'm also conscious of the privilege I carry. For anyone moving to Japan to lead a team, my advice is to be slow and deliberate.\n\nDeliver important news one-on-one before making major announcements. Don't expect clear or immediate feedback, and don't assume silence means satisfaction. It's also critical to respect people's attachment to their roles, hierarchies, and existing relationships, which hold significant weight in Japanese workplaces.\n\nI learned all of these lessons firsthand.\n\nDo you have a story to share about working abroad?

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Hidde van Vliet, 37, the cofounder of Entourage in Bali. His words have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn 2023, the industrial logistics firm I worked for relocated from Amsterdam to Malta, and I was promoted to general manager. On paper, it looked like a step up. In reality, it was the first sign that the way I was structuring my life no longer fit.\n\nI helped lead the company's move — setting up the office, hiring staff, and building operations from scratch. Malta had what I thought I wanted: sun, ocean, and easy access to the outdoors. Socially, something was missing. Every six weeks, I flew back to Amsterdam just to see friends and family.\n\nNine months in, I quit. There was no dramatic blow-up — just a steady realization that the life I was building wasn't right.\n\nSoon after, I went to Cape Town for a university reunion. There, I slipped into a different rhythm: sunrise beach runs, surfing, padel at night, and constant social energy.\n\nWhen the trip ended, my friends went back to their jobs. I didn't.\n\nI pushed my flight home twice, and later returned to Cape Town solo on a three-month visa. That's where I first encountered digital nomads. Their days centered on work, wellness, and connection.\n\nIt looked like the dream. It also clarified something for me: A traditional corporate path wasn't going to give me the life I wanted.\n\nBack in Amsterdam, I took on freelance strategy and finance work to rebuild my savings. Around that time, my friend Joost — now my cofounder — left his job too.\n\nWe'd met years earlier at PwC and stayed close. On a weekend trip to Barcelona, over a glass of rosé, he said, \"This remote work trend is incredible. We should do something with it.\"\n\nPost-COVID, remote workers were clustering in places like Cape Town and Bali. As we spoke to friends living that lifestyle, one pattern kept coming up: Most communities started organically but weren't built to scale. Events were scattered, inconsistent, or hard to access unless you already knew people.\n\nWe wondered what it would look like to build a community intentionally — one centered on health, wellness, and connection, with structured events designed to make meeting people easy. Over two months, that idea took shape into Entourage, a city-based network for digital nomads, built around shared activities and deliberate space for conversation.\n\nChoosing where to launch was the next question. Cape Town felt personal but seasonal. Joost knew Bali well. I'd never been, but its year-round density of nomads made it the obvious choice.\n\nIn October 2024, we spent three weeks in Bali speaking with dozens of travelers and local businesses — gyms, cafés, padel clubs — to understand what was missing. The opportunity felt real.\n\nWe moved to Bali in March 2025 and got started the day we landed. We aimed to build as leanly as possible. Joost and I invested about $17,500 of our own money into the business, excluding living costs. This covered visas, company setup, and some marketing spend.\n\nWithin weeks, we were hosting padel games, run clubs, and surf sessions. Not everything worked. Some events flopped. Early runs were small.\n\nThe turning point came when Bali Social Club, a padel and wellness space in Canggu, offered to co-host our weekly morning run with ice bath access. We went all in, planning a scenic route, inviting everyone we knew, even printing custom T-shirts.\n\nThat first morning, 40, then 50 people showed up. Watching strangers connect afterward, I realized we'd built something bigger than an event.\n\nThat was the gap I'd felt moving between Malta, Cape Town, and Amsterdam. I didn't want backpacker chaos or closed expat circles. I wanted community — people committed to their work and well-being, wherever they landed.\n\nIn Bali, I have it all: lifestyle, friendships, and purpose.\n\nDo you have a story to share about living abroad?

    "fullText": "When Joe Hawkins agreed to return to Wales last summer it was for moments like Saturday, when he could lock horns with a trio of Scottish Lions at Principality Stadium.\n\nThe 23-year-old Scarlets centre won his eighth cap in Sunday's defeat by France in Cardiff.\n\nIt was Hawkins' first Six Nations appearance since the 2023 win against Italy in Rome, the last time Wales enjoyed a success in the championship.\n\nThe centre moved from Ospreys to Exeter at the end of that season and fell victim of the Welsh Rugby Union's cap selection policy.\n\n\"A big part in me coming back to Wales was to try and be part of the Welsh squad and to play in competitions like this,\" said Hawkins, who missed the 2023 World Cup after his move to the Chiefs.\n\n\"I don't think there is a better international competition than the Six Nations. It's amazing being back involved.\"\n\nWales 'can't cut corners' in losing streak - Wilson\n\nWales to face Fiji at Cardiff City Stadium\n\nTandy 'needs help' - Wales' hunt for defence coach\n\nHawkins returned to Wales with Scarlets last year and started against New Zealand and South Africa in the autumn.\n\nAfter being preferred to Cardiff's Ben Thomas against France last weekend, he lined up in between fly-half Dan Edwards and outside centre Eddie James for the first time at international level.\n\nThe trio boast a total of 23 caps and could now face a well-oiled Scotland trio of Finn Russell, Sione Tuipulotu and Huw Jones.\n\nThey toured Australia with the British and Irish Lions last summer – joining forces in the XV in the first Test – and have a combined tally of 186 international outings for Scotland.\n\nFrance caused Wales all manner of problems with ball in hand and another tough defensive examination is coming.\n\n\"They've got quite a settled centre partnership, so whoever gets the chance this is a good test,\" said Hawkins.\n\n\"Tuipulotu's obviously a powerful ball carrier, but he's got nice subtle skills as well. Huw Jones has got a bit of gas and some nice running lines, so they complement each other well.\"\n\nThe Glasgow combination could be going up against a Scarlets duo if Hawkins and James hold off the challenge of Thomas and fit-again Ospreys centre Owen Watkin.\n\nJames, 23 and 6ft 3ins, showed signs of promise with ball in hand against Les Bleus.\n\n\"He had an injury during the off season and since he has come back for the Scarlets he has been really physical in the carry and in defence,\" said Hawkins, who also partnered James for Wales Under-20s.\n\n\"He has brought that into the Six Nations and he is a big man. When you've got people like that in the team you just want to get them on the ball as much as possible.\"\n\nAfter shipping 15 tries and 102 points in the first two rounds, Wales clearly have work to do in defence.\n\nHowever, Hawkins' playmaking abilities are key to them also posing more questions in attack.\n\n\"We talk a lot about being a team that can excite the nation,\" said the centre, who featured at fly-half for Scarlets in the first half of the season.\n\n\"A lot of the best teams in the world believe in their style of game and wouldn't change. France double down on that and they are one of the best in the world.\n\n\"After a couple of disappointing results it's not the time to go away from what is working, or going to work, for us moving forward. We just need to keep banging the drum.\"",

    "fullText": "The stadium at the Centro de Alto Rendimento de Futebol Feminino (CARFEM) in Ypané holds a special chapter in the career of defender Sofia. It was there, at the very same place where the Brazilian National Team is currently based, that the defender won her first South American title wearing the Amarelinha jersey. With the U-17 team, she not only lifted the trophy but also left her mark: she sealed the 5-1 rout against Paraguay that secured the continental trophy.\n\nNow, competing in the South American Championship for the second time in her career, this time with the U-20 National Team, Sofia returns to the same environment that helped shape her identity in the National Team. More mature, she carries the memories of a campaign that marked a turning point in her career as an athlete. \"The U-17 South American was my first important competition with the national team, and it was incredible. We won, there was a really good energy among the players too. I think I didn’t have as much experience as some of the others, but at the same time I grew along with them, because it was a new squad. It was amazing,\" she recalled in an interview with CBFTV.\n\nSofia during the match against Paraguay in the first game of the final stage of the U-20 South American ChampionshipCredits: Staff Images / CBF\n\nThe CARFEM Stadium was not just the setting for the title. It was also where Sofia scored her first goal for the National Team. Against Paraguay, in front of a loud opposing crowd, she netted the last goal of the championship campaign. \"My first goal with the national team was here at CARFEM, against Paraguay. It was an incredible feeling. There were Paraguayan fans here, drums beating, I scored the last goal, the title-winning goal. I was very happy to have fulfilled that dream with the national team, especially in a tournament of that size,\" she said.\n\nThe victory was followed by the U-17 World Cup, an experience that brought new challenges and lessons. Eliminated in the early stage, Brazil did not achieve the expected goal, but it was essential for the athlete’s development. \"It was very challenging. I think I grew even more there, you know? It was a turning point for me. I think we learn from defeat. We closed that cycle that way, with many lessons learned,\" she stated.\n\nSofia during the match against Peru in the U-20 South American Championship in ParaguayCredits: Staff Images / CBF\n\nBorn in the Grajaú neighborhood, in the North Zone of Rio de Janeiro, Sofia started playing football as a child, directly influenced by her twin brother. The bond between the two was the starting point for a journey that would lead her to the Brazilian National Team. \"I started when I was about six, following my brother. He went to play football and I went to ballet. Then I said: mom, I want to go too. That’s when I started with him,\" she recounted.\n\nSofia began at the Grajaú Tênis Clube soccer school, where she stayed until she was 11. She later stepped away due to a lack of opportunities for girls at the time. Even so, football never left her routine. \"From 11 to about 13 or 14, I would go to the club every day with my brother to play ball. It was just me and him after school.\"\n\nSofia during a training session with the Brazil U-20 National Team in Ypané, ParaguayCredits: Staff Images / CBF\n\nAt 15, she decided to fully pursue her dream. Her mother found a tryout at Flamengo, and Sofia seized the opportunity. \"I did the tryout, passed at Flamengo, and was first monitored from 2022 until the beginning of 2023. Then I moved up to the U-17 at 15. And I’m still at Flamengo today,\" she celebrated.\n\n\"Everyone says it was a very fast progression. When I played in 2023 at Flamengo, I didn’t even know how to control the ball properly on the field. I had a lot of futsal habits. Then I started to learn, I learned to play as a defender because I was tall and fast,\" she added.\n\nSofia’s first call-up was for the Algarve Tournament in Portugal. One of the most memorable moments in her journey. \"The list came out, I was at home. When I saw it, I started crying. My mother cried, my brother cried, my cousin cried. It was unforgettable,\" she recalled.\n\nFamily support was decisive at every stage. Her father, a passionate Flamengo fan, was the one who introduced her to football by taking her to stadiums. Her mother and grandmother took on the role of logistical and emotional support, accompanying her to practices and trips. Her brother, a water polo athlete at Flamengo, remains one of her biggest supporters.\n\n\"I have a wonderful family core. For my mother, it’s very easy. For my grandmother, it’s harder to understand that I train every day, travel, but from the beginning she took me to practices. My father moved far away but keeps up and wants to know everything. And my brother is a ‘doting’ one. Whenever he can, he watches my games and I watch his,\" she said.\n\nNayara, Sofia, and Elu during the National Anthem before a match in the U-20 South American Championship in ParaguayCredits: Staff Images / CBF\n\nBack at the South American Championship, Sofia is now experiencing a new moment. More experienced, she observes the team’s growth throughout the competition and faces the challenge with confidence. \"We talk a lot as a group about being on an upward trajectory. I think we learned what we needed to in the first phase, and now every game is a final,\" she said.\n\nThe campaign so far has brought obstacles, from intense heat to traditional rivals like Argentina. All of it, according to her, served as a lesson. \"It was a tough phase to understand the climate, the refereeing, the other teams. But I think now it’s about going all out with everything we have,\" she explained.\n\nBrazil faces Colombia at 8 p.m. (Brasília time) next Thursday (19th), for the second round of the final stage of the U-20 Women’s South American Championship, at Estádio Luis Alfonso Giagni, in the Paraguayan city of Villa Elisa. Even with the pressure of the decisive stages, for Sofia, the prevailing feeling is the best possible. \"There’s a bit more nervousness, but at the same time there’s a lot of motivation. We’ve already experienced what we needed to, we’ve already won, we’ve already lost. Now it’s more motivation than anything else,\" she concluded.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence. You can read the original version in 🇧🇷 here.",

    "fullText": "Whether you like it or not, NCAA Division III women’s wrestling programs will host their own championship during the 2027-28 season.\n\nThe reason? Competitive balance.\n\nIt should shock no one that this was the inevitable direction for women’s college wrestling. Division III schools do not offer athletic scholarships, so a separate end-of-year tournament makes sense.\n\nD3 Hobart College in Geneva, New York, doesn’t face Power Four Alabama for the NCAA men’s football championship. Why would D3 Eureka College in Eureka, Illinois, face Power Four Iowa for the NCAA women’s wrestling title?\n\n“Any time an athletic director adds a sport, the first question they will ask is if we can be reasonably competitive to justify it,” NCWA executive director Mike Moyer said. “No athletic director wants to add a sport where they can’t provide a quality experience. It doesn’t mean they have to win a national title. They just want to know if we can reasonably provide a good experience.”\n\nThis is what competitive sports do.\n\nDouble A teams play Double A teams in baseball.\n\nG League teams play G League teams in basketball.\n\nD3 schools face other D3 schools in wrestling.\n\n“The split was a long time coming, and in the grand scheme of women’s wrestling, it allows us to continue to grow at a high rate,” Eastern coach Andrew Taylor said. “With Division III passing the vote to split off for our own championships, Division II and Division I can use the momentum to continue their growth as well.\n\n\"The split was a long time coming.\" - Eastern coach Andrew Taylor\n\n“For our program at Eastern, it really only changes how we approach things for two weekends out of the year. We will still be recruiting athletes who want to chase World Teams, and we will still be creating a schedule that allows us to compete against some of the best programs in the country in all divisions.\n\n“I am excited for what the leadership committee can do to create an incredible event, and our goal will be to chase a team trophy in that first year.”\n\nFor the next two years, all three divisions will compete at the NCAA Women’s Wrestling Championships in March. This offers a unique historical opportunity for Division III programs to win championships and become All-Americans against their D1 and D2 counterparts.\n\nNorth Central — a Division III program in Naperville, Illinois — is the outlier. The Cardinals won the 2023 National Collegiate Women’s Wrestling Championships (without Iowa), then finished second to the Hawkeyes in 2024 and 2025.\n\nThe Joe Norton-led squad won the 2026 NWCA National Duals on January 9-10, handing Iowa its first dual loss in program history with a 23-21 semifinal win. North Central defeated McKendree in the finals, 21-18, for its first National Duals title after finishing second for three straight years.\n\nNews of the D3 split was announced on January 16, leading some to speculate that North Central’s recent National Duals success against D1 and D2 teams played a factor.\n\nThe driving force was the announcement that the NCAA Championships would feature 18-woman brackets at each of the 10 weights. Had it been 21 or 24 qualifiers per weight, a split may have been delayed.\n\nNCAA women's programs by division\n\nNorth Central’s four-season run is staggering. The Cardinals are 55-5 in duals, and have placed 145, 160, and 110.5 points ahead of the next closest Division III team at the national championships.\n\n“I hate (the split),” Norton said. “Selfishly, I hate it.”\n\n“If you asked our women if they want to go and have the experience they had last year, they would take it. We lost by 19.5 points, but we were winning going into day two. To have that experience and to go toe-to-toe with the Hawkeyes and fall short and lose, or win by 145 points? Our girls would choose losing. Our girls would take the experience they had over winning by 145 points (at the Division III NCAA Championships).\n\n\"Selfishly, I hate the split.\" - North Central coach Joe Norton\n\n“I’m answering questions right now from recruits that don’t want to come here because we are going to be D3. Over time, we aren’t going to have that level of athlete, regardless of how good our coaching staff is. It’s not like we go D3 and we’re not as good of coaches. We’re the same coaching staff, but we’re not going to coach the same high-level athletes.”\n\nNorton won’t go down without a fight. He’s exploring a multidivisional classification that allows a Division III program to compete at the highest level. That’s why the Franklin & Marshall (D3) and Lock Haven (D2) men’s wrestling teams compete at the NCAA D1 Championships.\n\nThe multidivisional rule no longer exists, but Norton will petition. Moving from D3 to D1 is a 12-year process for an athletic program, so that’s off the table. He will use St. Thomas University to bolster his case. The NCAA granted the Tommies permission to move directly from D3 to D1 in 2021.\n\nCould the North Central women’s wrestling team do the same?\n\nHere’s where it gets tricky. Athletic directors want to win championships. Is it better to win a D3 team championship just like every other program at North Central is striving to do, or go toe-to-toe against Iowa, McKendree, and Grand Valley State to possibly finish second or fourth, or 10th?\n\nOr, with the right tournament and the right recruits, maybe you win one at the highest level.\n\n\"You can’t win the lotto if you don’t buy a lotto ticket.” - Joe Norton\n\n“We’re not asking for scholarships; we just want to compete in the national collegiate tournament, which is Division I and II for women’s wrestling. That’s still my optimistic hope. That’s what we want to do. Our athletic director has to agree, and our president has to agree. We can’t do anything if our president doesn’t agree to do it. And the NCAA would have to approve a petition.\n\n“The odds are, in 2028, we are going to be Division III, but we are going to take this shot in the dark and see what happens. I’ve also told every girl, if you come here and we split off, and we don’t get to petition up, I’ll make the right calls to get you to the right place. I’m not going to handcuff you and make you stay here. If that’s your dream and you want to go do that, then we’ll do it. We’ll find the right program for you. I just told a recruit that yesterday.\n\n“No one thought we were going to beat Iowa. We’re going to try. You can’t win the lotto if you don’t buy a lotto ticket.”\n\nFor now, D1 and D2 programs will host their own NCAA Championship when the D3 split happens, leaving more questions than answers.\n\nWill D2 programs split like D3, leaving eight D1 programs on an island? Division II has the minimum number of programs to make the request, so they may move forward with it.\n\n“I don’t know the answer to that, but I don’t know why they couldn’t,” Moyer said. “I’ve never been told they couldn’t, but I’ve never been told for certain if they can’t.\n\n“No matter what, we need to add a lot more D1 and D2 programs, and that’s exactly what the NWCA is working on.”\n\nAlso, how many national qualifiers will each division have? Under the current format, there are 18. It seems likely that the number will decrease when the split happens in 2028.\n\nWill it be 4 qualifiers? 8? 12? 16?\n\n“No matter what, we need to add a lot more D1 and D2 programs, and that’s exactly what the NWCA is working on.” - NWCA executive director Mike Moyer\n\nColorado Mesa coach Travis Mercado likes a challenge, including battles with the Hawkeyes, but he also likes the idea of winning a championship against comparable programs. As it stands today, the Mavericks will continue to face D1 teams like Iowa, Lehigh, Presbyterian, Lindenwood, Sacred Heart, and Delaware State.\n\n“Is it the right time (for D2 to split)? I don’t know,” Mercado said. “Competitive Travis Mercado and Colorado Mesa says, yes, we want to be able to compete amongst our peers and have an equitable opportunity to compete for a national championship against a similar school like Grand Valley State, McKendree, King, Quincy, and Fort Hays. Right now, you have one juggernaut in the University of Iowa.”\n\n“I think as Division I teams add and Division II teams add, then we can start to have this conversation of splitting off. I hope we’re at a point with women’s collegiate wrestling that we’re able to split off, we’ll have D1, D2, D3, NAIA, and junior college. I’m excited about that opportunity down the road. It might take two years. It might take five or 10.”\n\nEither way, the landscape of women’s college wrestling is changing — fast.\n\nKasey Kruczek, Wilkes\n“For me, I like seeing all the divisions wrestling together, but I also know how great it is to split off for those athletes with their training schedules. I think it comes down to preseason and postseason training schedules. Athletes can work out all year on their own, but I don’t get as much of the preseason with them as the other divisions. I get eight flex practices that I can coach with them, and our strength and conditioning coaches can work out with them, but I can’t be in there if it’s not on flex days.”\n\nTyler Keane, Western New England\n\"I love a D3 split. I think it allows Division III athletes to compete for a national title and All-American. Not that we don’t get to now, but this kind of evens the playing field. We have a bunch of athletes who are hungry for this split, and we can’t wait to compete. Right now, we’re focused and excited for the regional tournament and national tournament this year. When that D3 split happens, I think it gives a fair, competitive advantage for Division III athletes.\n\n\"I find it’s uneven when it comes to training. In terms of training and practices, and being able to be with your athletes during certain times of the year. Division I has more opportunities, and the big thing with D1 and D2 is athletic scholarships, which makes it difficult for D3, at least on my end, for recruiting.\"\n\nJoe Jamison, Ursinus\n\"I think in the long run, for the growth of the sport and for the sustainability of Division III, I think it’s important. Selfishly, I hate it right now. As a women’s wrestling coach at a Division III school, it’s been a lot of fun to compete at the highest level possible. Right now, we have a ton of talent on our team, and we’re excited to continue to pursue our goals and try to get girls on the podium and win national titles at the highest level. At the same time, for the longevity of the sport, I know the split is important as it is going to level the playing field for the schools that don’t have the same resources as Division I and Division II schools.\n\n\"It’s twofold. There’s the financial piece where it comes down to budgets, resources available, and scholarships. As a Division III school, for the most part, our budgets are going to be smaller than those of Division I and Division II schools. It’s just the nature of how it works. They can offer athletic scholarships where we can’t.\n\n\"The other piece is the rules piece. Division I and Division II institutions can mandate athletic hours the minute they step on campus. They can mandate off-season hours where they are either in the room or in the weight room. For us, in Division III, we’re not allowed to do that. Coaches are not allowed to be around their athletes in an athletic setting at all until official practice starts. Division I and II schools start practicing eight hours a week, where we can’t do anything that’s mandated or even be with them until October.\n\n\"A lot of Division III schools have found a way around that with RTCs. If you have one, you can do certain things. You can’t mandate it, but it is available.\"",

    "description": "Detroit Tigers shortstop Javier Báez addressed his suspension from the 2026 World Baseball Classic after a positive marijuana test during the 2023 tournament.",
    "fullText": "Javier Báez didn’t dodge responsibility. He didn’t deflect blame. And he didn’t sugarcoat how much it hurts.\n\nSpeaking Tuesday, Feb. 17, at spring training in Lakeland, the Detroit Tigers shortstop addressed his suspension from the 2026 World Baseball Classic, which will prevent him from representing Team Puerto Rico after testing positive for marijuana during the 2023 WBC.\n\n“I don’t want to point fingers at anybody because this is all my fault,” Báez said via the Detroit Free Press. “I’m the one that failed the test. … It’s just really frustrating that I won’t be able to be there. … It really hurts my family, my reputation, but it’s part of it. Other than that, I got a long season to go, and I got to prepare for that.”\n\nThe 2026 World Baseball Classic is scheduled to run from March 5–17, but Báez’s suspension — handed down by the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) — does not expire until April 26, making him ineligible for the tournament.\n\nWhile Major League Baseball has permitted marijuana use since 2020 under its jointly negotiated drug policy with the MLB Players Association, the WBSC still prohibits the substance. MLB and the MLBPA explored whether Báez could be cleared for the tournament, but those efforts ultimately failed.\n\n“I understand the rules,” Báez said. “It’s not like I was taking steroids or anything to last longer or whatever. They made that decision. I’m fine with it – I mean, I’m not fine with it. I just keep my mouth shut.”\n\nThe positive test dates back to March 12, 2023, during the previous WBC. As a result, Báez received a two-year period of ineligibility — from April 26, 2024, through April 26, 2026 — which bars him from WBSC-sanctioned events.\n\n“There are a lot of people mad and frustrated,” Báez said, “but it doesn’t hurt more than it hurts me. It’s time to turn the page and get ready for the season – and try to stay healthy.”\n\nThe timing makes the situation even more painful. Team Puerto Rico will host WBC games in 2026, marking the first time the tournament returns to the island since 2013. For Báez, the opportunity carried deep personal meaning.\n\n“One of my dreams is to play in Puerto Rico for Team Puerto Rico with our families, our fans, our island,” Báez said. “Nothing I can do. I’m just happy for all of my teammates that got the chance to represent. I wish them good luck.”\n\nBáez, who lives in Puerto Rico during the offseason, vividly remembers watching the inaugural 2006 World Baseball Classic as a 13-year-old fan in the stands at Hiram Bithorn Stadium in San Juan.\n\n“It’s been a long, long time since we played this tournament in Puerto Rico,” Báez said. “To have the chance to be a part of that, and now it’s away from me, it really hurts.”\n\nThe post Detroit Tigers’ Javier Báez Addresses Suspension, WBC Absence appeared first on Detroit Sports Nation.",

He is a true three-down back; he fits what Sean Payton likes to do to a tee and he is still only 24 years old.\n\nHowever, his current team, the New York Jets, could foil any plans the Broncos may have of obtaining him.\n\nRecently, Adam Schefter of ESPN put together a list of players who could get the franchise tag placed on them, and Hall is one of those guys. Though the franchise tag doesn't shut down talks of a player moving on from that team, it makes it much more difficult to get them away from that team, and that was the purpose of the franchise tag in the first place.\n\nShould the Jets apply the tag to Hall, it would likely mean he would play at least the 2026 season with the Jets and it would allow the team extra time to come up with a long-term deal to keep him there much longer. If a team like the Broncos wanted to acquire him at that point, it would require giving up multiple first-round picks.\n\nIt would essentially end any thought the team may have of adding Hall to its offensive backfield. Instead, the Broncos would have to look at other options. Fortunately, there are plenty.\n\nWould Breece Hall be the missing piece on the Broncos offense to win a Super Bowl? | @TroyRenck@EricGoodman#BroncosCountry\n\nSponsored by https://t.co/ta6du3zyQx & https://t.co/7GdKA7T5Itpic.twitter.com/nWcwYPPDcz\n\n— Troy Renck (@TroyRenck) February 18, 2026\n\nKenneth Walker III was just named MVP of Super Bowl LX and Rico Dowdle is coming off a strong season with the Carolina Panthers. They are both scheduled to be unrestricted free agents. A more cost-friendly option, and one that would make plenty of sense, would be to grab Atlanta Falcons running back Tyler Allgeier.\n\nFinally, the Broncos could look at re-signing J.K. Dobbins and putting a lot of faith in him staying healthy. That would be a bit of a gamble, but the team does have options.\n\nMORE:Broncos not named as potential landing spot for Tyreek Hill following Dolphins release\n\nFor Broncos fans who were hoping to land Hall, they will have to hope that the Jets choose not to tag him. However, it would make sense for a Jets team that is looking to turn its fortunes around to make sure it keeps its best offensive player in the fold.\n\nBroncos may be getting an idea of cost for A.J.

    "fullText": "It is with sad hearts that we learn of the passing of George Barber, founder of the Barber Vintage Motorsports Museum. The AMA Motorcycle Hall of Famer was 85.\n\nBarber was a philanthropist, real estate developer and businessman, son of George Warren Barber Sr., who founded Barber Dairies in the 1930s. Barber Jr. began privately collecting motorcycles in the '70s, and in 1994, established a museum to display his collection to the public. In 2003, he opened Barber Motorsports Park in Birmingham, Alabama, where he relocated his museum.\n\nBarber Vintage Motorsports Museum: An Interview with George Barber\n\nThe AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame inducted Barber in 2014, in recognition of his efforts in preserving motorcycle history.\n\nThe American Motorcyclist Association is saddened to learn of the passing of AMA Motorcycle Hall of Famer George Barber, who passed away at 85 years old.\n\nFounder of the prestigious Barber Vintage Motorsports Museum in Birmingham, Ala., home to the world's largest collection of historic motorcycles, Barber had a unique impact on the motorcycling community.\n\nSon of George H. Barber, founder of Barber Dairy and pioneer for dairy pasteurization in the United States, the younger Barber's love for motor vehicles started early in his life. In the 1960s, Barber raced and wrenched on his own Porsche racers with great success, claiming a large collection of wins behind the wheel.\n\nBarber's interest in motorcycles began soon after, leading him to open his own museum and hire skilled workers to restore vintage motorcycles to help build his collection. At the same time, Barber operated a vintage motorcycle racing team, which raced across the United States and Europe.\n\nIn 1994, Barber's museum gained 501(c)(3) nonprofit status and was officially named the Barber Vintage Motorsports Museum.\n\nIn 2002, Barber opted to close the original location of the Barber Vintage Motorsports Museum, moving his collection to its current location in September 2003, an 830-acre complex that also includes a 2.38-mile road circuit.\n\nFor his longtime preservation of motorcycle history, Barber was inducted into the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame in 2014.\n\nBecome a Motorcycle.com insider.

After parsing through the lyrics, Glenn was sold.\n\n\"Eventually, we really explored the meaning behind it and the passion that we could really pour into the program,\" Glenn said. \"I'm really happy with how it came out.\"\n\nGlenn wasn't the only one delighted with the decision to use the track.

    "fullText": "CLEARWATER, Fla.- Both Montverde Academy (Fla.) and Clearwater Calvary Christian (Fla.) were both teams that last season competed for the FHSAA’s Class 2A state championship, with the latter coming away with the title in the end.\n\nOn Tuesday night, the No. 3 ranked Eagles showed why they’re one of the country’s top ranked teams, getting a superb pitching performance from senior ace pitcher Nevaeh Williams in a 4-0 victory over the No. 20 Warriors. For Montverde Academy, they improved to 2-0 on the season and have yet to give up a run through two games.\n\nWilliams was terrific throughout the evening for Montverde Academy as the right-handed pitcher struck out more than 10 batters and yielded just one hit. Though Calvary Christian (0-1) had their chances, they couldn’t capitalize against Montverde Academy.\n\nThe Eagles (2-0) got on the board in the top of the third inning when junior Audrey Vivino scored on a double by senior shortstop Colby Reish, to give Montverde Academy a 1-0 lead. That’s all Williams needed, but the senior would get some additional run support in the fourth inning on a Cali Flowers score and then senior outfielder Addison Poe would blast a solo homer in the top of the fifth inning.\n\nMontverde Academy would tag on another run in the top of seventh for good measure as Williams finished a complete game in the bottom half of the frame.\n\nMontverde Academy, located in Montverde, Florida, is a private, co-educational school renowned for its strong academics, competitive athletics, and diverse extracurricular programs. The academy offers a range of AP and honors courses, preparing students for higher education and future careers. Montverde’s athletic teams are highly competitive, often achieving regional and national recognition. Emphasizing leadership, personal development, and community service, the school ensures students are well-prepared for future success.",

    "fullText": "With March Madness inching closer, Jay Bilas is ready to give his take on how the college basketball landscape looks with just three weeks of regular-season play left.\n\nBilas just released his ranking of the top 68 college basketball teams at ESPN, and the Kentucky Wildcats came in at No. 28. Just like the latest top-25 polls, Bilas isn’t ready to call these Wildcats a top-25 team just yet.\n\nHere’s what he had to say about Kentucky.\n\n“The early returns on this Kentucky team were not promising,” Bilas wrote. “The Wildcats opened the season 5-4 with lopsided losses to Michigan State and Gonzaga. And it hasn’t been all clear skies since — they scored only 55 points in a 25-point road loss at Vanderbilt on Jan. 27 — but they have righted the ship with a 12-4 response to their sputtering start. One clear difference has been the play of Otega Oweh. He averaged 13.7 points through those first nine games, but 18.8 in the 16 since. They’ll need him to maintain that with Kam Williams and Jayden Quaintance still out.”\n\nThe Wildcats actually have four wins over teams ranked ahead of them: No. 20 Arkansas, No. 19 St. John’s, and No. 16 Tennessee (twice). Kentucky also has wins over No. 31 Texas, No. 34 Indiana, and No. 61 LSU.\n\nAll eight of Kentucky’s losses are to teams in this ranking, the lowest being Missouri at No. 49. The other seven losses are against teams in the top 23 of this ranking.\n\nFlorida, who Kentucky just lost on the road to and hosts in the regular-season finale, checks in at No. 7.\n\nSo, do you like this spot for the Cats?

    "description": "This under-the-radar pick has made an incredible leap in his off-the-tee game in 2026",
    "fullText": "It’s been a heckuva start to the 2026 PGA Tour season. Last week delivered a compelling back nine with Collin Morikawa holding off charges from Scottie Scheffler and a slew of other contenders to get his first win on U.S. soil since 2021. It’s also been a fantastic start in the Golf Digest picks column. Collectively, our group is up over 25 units in just five events across matchup and top-10 bets. Plus, one of our writers, Stephen Hennnessey cashed Justin Rose at 60-1 in winning Torrey Pines a few weeks ago.\n\nIt’s tough to start much better. We’re wrapping up the West Coast swing with some confidence and cash in our pockets. See who our Golf Digest betting panel—which is comprised of Pat Mayo of Underdog/Mayo Media Network, Andy Lack of the Inside Sports Network, Ryan Noonan of Betsperts, your two authors and Keith Stewart, the CEO of Read The Line—are betting this week at The Riviera Country Club.\n\nWatch the Pat Mayo Experience betting show with Read The Line's Keith Stewart here.\n\nScroll down for our complete betting analysis of the 2026 Genesis Invitational:\n\nGenesis Invitational picks 2026: Our Experts’ Outright Predictions\n\nPat Mayo, Underdog/Fantasy National, Mayo Media Network analyst: Rory McIlroy (+1325, DraftKings) — Five or so holes completely sank McIlroy's chances at Pebble Beach. When Rory is losing strokes driving and putting in the same event chalk that up to a couple brain farts. His approach play, however, was one of the best of the week. At Riv, Rory’s driver will transform back into the weapon to dominate off the tee at a longer course, while his putting will likely bounce back since he’s been one of the best putters on tour over the past two years (+0.35/per round). After finally picking up his Augusta win, to go along with Quail Hollow and Bay Hill, Riviera is the last of the similar tracks he’s yet to take down.\n\nKeith Stewart, PGA, Read The Line: Rory McIlroy (+1325, DraftKings) — Course conditions at Riviera will favor players who are peaking with their iron game, can score on Poa Annua, and can separate themselves with the driver. Hello, Rory McIlroy! McIlroy gained 6.8 strokes on approach at Pebble Beach and recorded a 17-under-par total with two sevens on his card. Rory’s short game was sharp, and he carded 25 sub-par scores for the week. Coming off the confidence Augusta gave him last year, I’m taking McIlroy to capture another career trophy that has eluded him.\n\nRyan Noonan, Content Manager 4for4/Betsperts: Scottie Scheffler (+320, Bet365) — Scheffler hasn’t played at Riviera since his famed switch to the mallet putter. In fact, the 2024 Genesis Invitational was the last time he used a blade putter on tour. His Riviera history (T-10, T-12, T-7, T-20 in his past four starts) is quite pedestrian by Scheffler’s supremely high standards, but he has gained more strokes tee-to-green (27.09) than anyone else has at Riviera over that four-event stretch. Caddie Ted Scott has a ton of success around here as well, caddieing for three Bubba Watson wins at Riviera. I know he’s not swinging a club this week, but that experience certainly helps at a course that’s known for its strategic demands.\n\nStephen Hennessey, Golf Digest managing editor: Cameron Young (35-1, Caesars Sportsbook) — It's been two poor weeks in a row, but Cameron Young is a great fit for Riviera, so I’m willing to look at the longer-term data. Everyone was so high on him heading into 2026. CY is the best player in this field looking at SG/total at Riviera, which is the third-most predictive course of the year. Give us the ball-striking gains we saw at the end of 2025 with the short game he’s shown over the past year, and we have the formula to winning at Riviera.\n\nChristopher Powers, Golf Digest senior writer: Matt Fitzpatrick (36-1, DraftKings) — Can’t help but love what we’re seeing from Fitzy so far in 2026. If he didn’t leave one in the bunker on the 72nd last week, he likely finishes in the top 10 for a second week in a row. And he’s off to this strong start despite an ice-cold putter, which we know can flip on a dime. The Englishman ranks seventh on tour this year in SG/tee-to-green, a key indicator of success at this iconic golf course over the years.\n\nAndy Lack, Inside Sports Network: Matt Fitzpatrick (36-1, DraftKings) — Matt Fitzpatrick is coming off a 14th-place finish at Pebble Beach where he gained 2.8 strokes off the tee and 7.8 strokes on approach, and he has been playing some great golf dating back to the end of last season, which includes a victory at the DP World Tour Championship. Fitzpatrick’s elite short game should pay dividends at Riviera this week.\n\nPast results: We have our FIRST winner of 2026, with Stephen Hennessey correctly predicting Justin Rose’s victory at Torrey Pines at 60-1!\n\nListen to Golf Digest's weekly betting podcast, \"The Loop,\" (above) where we interview the industry's leading experts (and sometimes tour pros) to help you make your bets and pick your fantasy lineups. And be sure to \n\nGenesis Invitational picks 2026: Sleepers/Dark Horses Who Could Win\n\nMayo: Harris English (40-1, FanDuel) — Tough to go too far down the board at a signature event when the books have compressed all the odds, so English is the man for me. While nothing seems particularly different about his game in 2026, the stats reveal an incredible leap in his driving year over year. Sixteen rounds is a pretty small sample, but English is gaining almost a stroke per round off the tee, second of all players to Scottie Scheffler. That’s +0.75 SG:OTT per round more on average than his performance over the past last year and a half. While his irons have dipped a bit this year, in his two starts where he was forced to hit longer irons (like Riviera), he’s been in the positive.\n\nStewart: Sepp Straka (50-1, Caesars Sportsbook) — More and more, Sepp Straka is becoming a factor in signature series events. Straka won the Truist last year and just finished runner-up at Pebble Beach. What was even more impressive than second place was the manner in which Sepp achieved it. Straka gained significantly across all four major strokes-gained categories. Something that previous winners of the Genesis have done. An 18th at WM Phoenix, and a signature second at Pebble, I’m taking a player who can hit fairways, lead the field in GIR, save par, and score on Poa greens.\n\nNoonan: Harris English (40-1, FanDuel) — If you were to boil the handicap down to a few key things this week, one of them must be bogey avoidance. The scoring chances are limited at Riviera, but you make things more difficult when you give strokes back. English ranks third in this week’s field in bogey avoidance over the past three seasons, and he also has great course history at Torrey Pines, Augusta National and here at Riviera. English plays his best golf on longer, tougher tracks, and I won’t be surprised when he has a late tee time on Sunday afternoon.\n\nHennessey, Golf Digest: Harris English (40-1, FanDuel) — English has been super consistent in 2026, and he’s been hitting it great off the tee a bit under the radar. With a tougher test due to the wet conditions and more long irons, that plays into English’s hands.\n\nPowers, Golf Digest: Tony Finau (120-1, DraftKings) — Not to brag, but I caught Big Tone at 225-1 on Monday (tried to tell y’all). That’s been slashed but I’m still all in. Two runner-up finishes here in his career, plus three other top 20s. After a brutal season last year, he’s finished T-11 (Farmers) and 18th (Pebble) in two of his last three. The only signs of life I need to see to take a shot.\n\nLack: Maverick McNealy (55-1, BetOnline) — Maverick McNealy has been showing some serious flashes with his ball-striking, and he remains one of the best Poa putters in this field. McNealy already has a seventh-place finish at Riviera, and I expect him to continue his strong play in California.\n\nGenesis Invitational picks 2026: Players We’re Fading\n\nMayo: Cameron Young (28-1, Bet365) — Until he can find his irons on a consistent basis, a second shot course like Riv is going to give him fits… and a lot of bogeys to sink his easy birdies.\n\nStewart: Cameron Young (28-1, Bet365) — This will be a polarizing pick. Cameron Young made a name for himself in 2022 when he finished runner-up at the Genesis Invitational. Since then, Young has racked up two more top 20s at Riviera. Why the fade? Cameron’s iron game has been off in his two most recent starts and three of his last four, going back to the Hero. Coupled with losing strokes at Pebble Beach and Torrey Pines on Poa greens in the last three weeks, I’ll let the rest of the pundits pick Young to win.\n\nNoonan: Sam Burns (33-1, FanDuel) — Maybe it’s just the fact that I can’t get over him hitting an iron off the 18th tee at Pebble … down two shots … on a hole where an eagle was in play, even in those conditions. I can’t unsee it.\n\nHennessey, Golf Digest: Russell Henley (22-1, BetRivers) — I love betting Henley as much as anybody, but I’ll do so on a shorter Bermuda course with more wedge shots.\n\nPowers, Golf Digest: Si Woo Kim (28-1, BetRivers) — Si Woo has been scorching hot to start the year, but I’m going to play the fatigue angle here. This will be his sixth straight week teeing it up. It may have already caught up to him at Pebble, where he tied for 45th, and he needed a final-round 65 just to do that.\n\nLack: Russell Henley (22-1, BetRivers) — With Riviera playing long and cold this year, Russell Henley’s lack of distance may be a serious problem. Henley is an elite wedge player and an extremely accurate driver, two skills that will be significantly diminished based on the course conditions I am expecting this week.\n\nGenesis Invitational picks 2026: Matchups\n\nMayo: Michael Kim (-110) over Kevin Yu (Coolbet) — My guy MK has been spotty since the calendar flipped, and spotty is miles ahead of Kevin Yu. Since three straight top 20s to begin the swing season, Yu lost his swing. Always one of the more reliable drivers of the ball the past few seasons, he’s lost that ability—and the rest of his game hasn’t been able to bail him out. Yu’s currently losing almost a stroke per round ball-striking in 2026.\n\nStewart: Jason Day (-120) over J.J. Spaun (FanDuel) — Jason Day has back-to-back top nine results playing in the Genesis at Riviera. Any course that requires Poa savvy and great iron play is a good fit for the Aussie. The Kikuyu rough will be familiar, and outside of a couple of poor iron shots at Pebble Beach, Day’s game is on point. J.J. Spaun is having serious issues with his putter. Spaun is losing an average of 3.2 strokes per event in his last four starts. To compound the challenge, Spaun lost nearly five strokes with the flatstick in his last start at Riviera (2024).\n\nNoonan: Tommy Fleetwood (-111) over Xander Schauffele (BetMGM) — Fleetwood is fourth in my model this week, and would likely be my top outright ticket if I were skipping Scottie. He models very well for me in a few key ball-striking stats, including his Good Drive% on long courses with difficult GIR accuracy. Xander lost over a stroke on approach in both weekend rounds at Pebble Beach, which shouldn’t instill a lot of confidence for those looking to back him this week.\n\nHennessey, Golf Digest: Collin Morikawa (-110) over Russell Henley (FanDuel) — I was tempted to bet Morikawa outright, but it’s so tough to go back to back. I’ll take him at a spot where he’s excelled before over my fade, Henley, who hasn’t had the best start to his 2026.\n\nPowers, Golf Digest: Matt Fitzpatrick (-120) over Ludvig Aberg (Bet365) — My pick to win over the defending champ (Torrey Pines). Very odd start to the year for Ludvig, who withdrew from AMEX with an illness, MC’d at Farmers, then opened with a 75 at the AT&T before clawing back to finish T-37. He has the talent to correct quickly, but Fitz is humming right now and might win if he catches fire with the flat stick.\n\nLack: Patrick Cantlay (-110) over Collin Morikawa (Southpoint) — I have no problem fading Collin Morikawa off a huge win, as Riviera will be a much more difficult test. Patrick Cantlay also performed well at Pebble Beach, and his distance off the tee and superior putting make him a safer bet this week.\n\nMatchup Results from the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am: Lack: 1 for 1 (Cantlay (-105) over Young); Powers: 1 for 1 (Fleetwood (-120) over Rose); Mayo: 1 for 1 (Straka (+112) over Bradley); Stewart: PUSH (Day (+100) over English); Hennessey: 0 for 1; Noonan: 0 for 1\n\nMatchup Results from the 2026 season (Wins-Losses-Pushes): Lack: 5-0-0 (up 4.26 units); Stewart: 3-0-1 (up 2.65 units); Powers: 4-1-0 (up 2.61 units); Mayo: 3-2-0 (up 1.26 units); Hennessey: 2-3-0 (down 1.17 units); Noonan: 1-4-0 (down 3.05 units)\n\nGenesis Invitational picks 2026: Top 10s\n\nMayo: Matt Fitzpatrick (+320, FanDuel) — Fresh off the best approach week of career, Fitz is now crushing both driving and iron play to kick off the season. Problem is, he hasn’t been able to chip or putt; two of his historic strengths. While it’s possible his ball-striking reverts to non-elite level, in the off chance he can keep it up and see his short game return to normal, then we have someone who will be near the top of the leader board.\n\nStewart: Hideki Matsuyama (+240, BetRivers) — In four starts this season, Hideki Matsuyama has finished T-13 at Sony, T-11 at Farmers, second at WMPO, and T-8 at the AT&T. The iron play is exquisite, and the short game is currently the best in the field. Matsuyama even gained with the putter in his last two outings. The 2024 Genesis winner only has one issue, and that is the driver. Without the big stick, I can’t justify the outright pick, but finishing top 10 as the defending venue champ is well within his current run.\n\nNoonan: Collin Morikawa (+250, FanDuel) — Morikawa is second in my model at Betsperts Golf this week. Yeah, Scheffler is first. For the record, he was second even before we had the Pebble Beach data. He leads the field in the Good Drive% on long courses with difficult GIR% and can meet the unique ball-striking demands of this venue. Dating back to the start of 2024, Morikawa is second in this field in SG/ball-striking when it’s difficult to gain off the tee and difficult to hit the green in regulation. There’s been a lot of overlap with leader boards at Riviera, Augusta National and Torrey Pines, and Morikawa rates out highly there as well, despite never winning at any of these venues.\n\nHennessey, Golf Digest: Matt Fitzpatrick (+320, FanDuel) — Fitz agonizingly left one in the bunker on the 72nd hole on Sunday, costing me a top-10 ticket last week. I’ll go back to the well after his best approach week of his career.\n\nPowers, Golf Digest: Rickie Fowler (+410, FanDuel) — Rick has quietly finished inside the top 20 in all three starts he’s made this year, and he’s returned to his 2022-’23 form with his irons. Driver has never been his strong suit, but he has had a few solid rounds with it in the last two weeks: Sunday at WMPO, when he ranked fourth in the field in SG/off-the-tee, and last Thursday at Pebble, when he gained 1.127 OTT.\n\nLack: Harris English (+300, BetRivers) — Harris English is one of my favorite plays on the slate this week, and he has been hitting his driver unbelievably well. English also possesses a great short game and finished seventh at Riviera in his last appearance at this event.\n\nTop-10 results from the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am: Mayo: 1 for 1 (Sepp Straka +500); Everybody else: 0 for 1\n\nTop-10 results from the 2026 season: Noonan: 2 for 5 (up 6.1 units); Mayo: 3 for 5 (up 11.7 units); Stewart: 2 for 5 (up 3.65 units); Lack: 1 for 5 (up 2 units); Powers: 1 for 5 (up 0.1 units); Hennessey: 0 for 5 (down 5 units)\n\nPat Mayo is an award-winning video host and producer of long and short-form content, and the host of The Pat Mayo Experience daily talk show.

I try to be balanced and I don't want to say that Vinícius is a liar and Prestianni is an incredible guy.\"\n\nIn his view, Real's number 7 \"ended the game\" because of his celebration near one of the corner flags and in front of the Benfica fans.\n\n\"I told Vinícius, independently, that when a player scores a goal like that, he should be carried on the shoulders (of his teammates). You don't go messing with a stadium or with the heart of the opponent's stadium. As they say in Spain, whoever scores a goal like that cuts tail and ear and doesn't finish the game, and he ended the game.\"\n\n\"I told Vinícius, you score a goal out of this world, why do you celebrate like that and not like one of the best in the world, like Di Stéfano, Pelé, Eusébio... why don't you celebrate with the joy of scoring?

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nShohei Ohtani is already ahead of last year.\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers' two-way superstar is already the best baseball player on the planet, and maybe ever. He's already a two-time World Series champion in two seasons with the Dodgers, too.\n\nAnd now, another reason for baseball to be scared.\n\nTwo seasons ago, Ohtani didn't pitch at all for the Dodgers as he recovered from Tommy John surgery.\n\nLast season, Ohtani had to ramp up slowly as he worked back into pitching in MLB games again.\n\nThis time around, Ohtani is already throwing at spring training.\n\n\"To see him face hitters, kind of start his buildup -- he’s certainly way ahead of where he was last year on the pitching side. That’s a good thing,\" manager Dave Roberts said Tuesday, via MLB.com. \"But I just really don’t worry too much about his buildup and preparation.\"\n\nMORE: There's one question Pirates phenom Konnor Griffin needs to answer\n\nOhtani isn't going to be pitching for Samurai Japan during the World Baseball Classic.\n\nThat means he can ramp up some of his throwing before leaving for the WBC, then will have to try to do it again after the tournament, with likely only some on-the-side pitching while taking part in the event.\n\n\"Obviously, last year [he] was coming back from surgery, and so we were very deliberate about a lot of things,\" president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman said, via MLB.com. \"This year we will be less so, but still mindful of it. It's a heavy, heavy load that he takes on that is different from every other player in baseball. And so I think a lot of it is reading and reacting.\"\n\nOhtani is already an MVP-level player in every way.

    "description": "​In this edition of The Sporting Tribune's bi-weekly draft notebook, we take a look at the most notable performances from the opening weekend of Divison-1 baseball, and what we saw over the weekend.",
    "fullText": "Reactions from the first day and weekend of Division-1 baseball can stick in the minds of scouts throughout the entirety of the spring. One singular game of 55 can be a mental staple despite the reality that it has no more important than the next game.\n\nIn this edition of The Sporting Tribune's bi-weekly draft notebook, we take a look at the most notable performances from the opening weekend of Divison-1 baseball, and what we saw over the weekend. Things that may stick with us through the entirety of the spring.\n\nUtah Tech 2B Kyle McDaniel reached base 11(!) times in three games to start the weekend (7-10, 4 BB); super unorthodox but feel to make contact is evident pic.twitter.com/ml7IFQtqIa\n\n— Taylor Blake Ward (@TaylorBlakeWard) February 15, 2026\n\nOne of the better hitters in the Western Athletic Conference (WAC), McDaniel proved his hitting prowess with one of the better early season performances against UC Riverside. Over four games against the Highlanders, he reached base safely in 15-of-21 plate appearances with zero strikeouts (8-for-14, six walks, one hit-by-pitch, double).\n\nWith an unorthodox setup and slap-and-dash swing from the left side and limited defensive versatility at second base, McDaniel may not jump to the top of boards through the spring, but his track record of hitting will propel him into early second day talk with a projected draft stock of rounds 4-7.\n\nSeen as one of the top pitchers in the 2026 draft class, Flora had one of the loudest performances across all of D1 on Friday when he ended the first inning with a 100-mph fastball with 21 inches of induced vertical break -- an uncommon shape for a fastball with that type of velocity.\n\nFlora struck out five Southern Miss hitters over six scoreless innings with no walks, three hits allowed and three batters hit. While the triple-digit moment was the standout moment, Flora held upper 90's velocity throughout the outing. Paired with his strike-throwing and pair of off-speed offering (sweeper, changeup) that both flash plus, he looks poised to be one of the top arms off the board come July -- if not the top arm in the class.\n\nMason Edwards strikes out the order, brings his total to 7 k’s in 4.0 innings across 65 pitches. pic.twitter.com/uNQDVwopyx\n\n— Anthony Arroyo (@AnthonyArroyo23) February 14, 2026\n\nUSC left-handed pitcher Mason Edwards made a strong statement as the Trojans’ Friday night starter. He struck out nine of the 15 batters he faced across five scoreless innings, allowing just one hit and two walks on an efficient 78 pitches.\n\nEdwin So - The Sporting Tribune\n\nUSC Trojan pitcher Mason Edwards (30) throws a pitch during an NCAA Men's baseball game between the USC Trojans and Pepperdine Wave Friday February 13,2026 at Dedeaux Field in Los Angeles Calif\n\nEdwards’ fastball sat 92–93 mph and topped out at 94, a slight dip from earlier reports, but he showed excellent command of the pitch throughout the outing. His slurve was particularly effective, generating the majority of his strikeouts and keeping hitters off balance.\n\nMason Edwards continuing to show good command with his SLV, gets third strikeout using his fastball, still sitting at 92-93, topping out at 94 in the 2nd inning across 40 pitches. pic.twitter.com/tI029inAeY\n\n— Anthony Arroyo (@AnthonyArroyo23) February 14, 2026\n\nWith South Carolina left-hander Jake McCoy sidelined due to a preseason arm injury, Edwards has positioned himself as a potential frontrunner to be the top college left-hander in the 2026 draft class, especially if his velocity ticks back up over his next few starts.\n\nUSC infielder Adrian Lopez had a strong Opening Day performance, going 1-for-2 with a double and a walk. He displayed solid plate discipline, consistently avoiding chase pitches and showing mature swing decisions throughout his at-bats.\n\nAdrian Lopez, in his 2nd AB double off the wall. pic.twitter.com/Z9N3SjxdRk\n\n— Anthony Arroyo (@AnthonyArroyo23) February 14, 2026\n\nLopez made the start at third base after playing first base for the Trojans last season. Defensively, he demonstrated a quick first step and good reactions on most balls hit his way, though his arm strength appeared average.\n\nAdrian Lopez at 3rd base, looking good with the with some grabs so far. Walked in his first at bat. pic.twitter.com/xS01QS9XAh\n\n— Anthony Arroyo (@AnthonyArroyo23) February 14, 2026\n\nOver the weekend, Lopez finished 2-for-9 with two doubles, two walks, and a hit-by-pitch, and one fielding error.\n\nStanding out as one of the best starting pitchers in the Western Athletic Conference, the senior's season debut was cut short after 2.2 inning when he exited the game due to some discomfort, which head coach Gary Adcock said was nothing serious, but also not worth pushing through so early in the season.\n\nSteven Park - The Sporting Tribune\n\nCBU Lancers pitcher Cody New (21) pitches during an NCAA Baseball game against the CSUF Titans on February 13, 2026 in Fullerton, California.\n\nNew struck out three Cal State Fullerton batters while allowing three hits and two walks.  New's four-seem sits around 93-94 MPH and he struggles to locate it at the top of the zone. His real standout pitches are his curveball and slider.\n\nCal Baptist LHP Cody New allowed three hits and two walks in 2.2 IP against CSUF with three K’s\n\nFB sat around 93-94 MPH and his curve between 77-80. Struggled with command at times, but his curveball has elite movement, esp. against RHH.\n\n⁦⁦⁦@TaylorBlakeWard⁩ pic.twitter.com/g02GMxirFQ\n\n— Jack Haslett (@JackHaslett_13) February 14, 2026\n\nNew's slider sits around 80 MPH and also has wicked movement that makes it unreachable for most right handed batters, while his curve ranges between 77-81 MPH, with great lateral movement and drop to elicit swings-and-misses and generate the majority of his strikeouts.\n\nSteven Park - The Sporting Tribune\n\nCSUF Titans pitcher Mikiah Negrete (4) pitches during an NCAA Baseball game against the CBU Lancers on February 13, 2026 in Fullerton, California.\n\nThe Titan's senior ace started the season strong against Cal Baptist by striking out four while allowing three hits in 5.0 innings of work.\n\nNegrete's fastball hovers in the low 90's but he shows impressive command with both his curveball, which sits around 83 MPH and features effective vertical drop, and his changeup that sits right at 80 MPH. The changeup looks to be Negrete's bread and butter pitch, using it well to break up sequences in an admittedly limited pitch arsenal and disrupt opposing batter's timing.\n\nMikiah Negrete allowed three hits and struck out four in 5.0 innings for the Titans.\n\nFastball sat around 89-90 MPH. His curveball touched 83 and his changeup right at 80.\n\nChangeup looks to be the SO pitch for the senior. Mixed up his sequences well. @TaylorBlakeWard pic.twitter.com/JlMoqSM4pT\n\n— Jack Haslett (@JackHaslett_13) February 14, 2026\n\nJessica Cryderman - The Sporting Tribune\n\nUCLA infielder, Roch Cholowsky (1) at bat, mid hit during a NCAA baseball game against UC San Diego on February 13, 2026 at Jackie Robinson Stadium in Los Angeles, CA.\n\nOne of the most highly anticipated debuts of the season on Friday night was UCLA junior shortstop Roch Cholowsky against UCLA San Diego.\n\nViewed as a potential No.1 pick for this year's draft, and with player comps such as Troy Tulowitzki and Carlos Correa, Cholowsky did not disappoint.\n\nAt the plate, Cholowsky went 1-4 with his lone hit coming in the 8th inning, blasting a double towards left field, which was just a foot shy of being a home run. The only other time he reached base was in the third inning when he reached on a fielder's choice. Despite having one hit, he showed tremendous patience at the plate, working the count all the way to the top, and had a walk in the fourth inning.\n\nRoch Cholowsky has shown a lot of patience tonight and just had his first walk of the evening on a 6 pitch at bat. Still\nLooking for that first single tonight. pic.twitter.com/fEIyRITyjr\n\n— Thomas Murray (@Thomas_L_Murray) February 14, 2026\n\nAcross the diamond, he showed tremendous speed and athleticism while playing defense. One of his most impressive plays at shortstop came on a blooper that was hit towards left-center field.

    "description": "Vanderbilt QB's draft stock is on shaky ground.",
    "fullText": "Todd McShay said the uncomfortable thing out loud about Diego Pavia originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nNFL Draft projections are difficult and certainly more science than art. However, throughout the draft season, many analysts must be the bearer of bad news. Sometimes it’s legitimate and sometimes it's over analyzing small details.\n\nIn the case of Diego Pavia, Todd McShay has delivered a take publicly that many already believed to be true. Pavia does not have an NFL quarterback skill set.\n\nThe important thing to remember is winning games or being exciting, does not necessarily relate to an NFL quarterback skill set nor is it an indicator of future NFL success. The most direct comp that explains this concept is that Diego Pavia is the anti-Tim Tebow.\n\nPavia, like Tebow, plays with a ton of grit and determination. He has moxie in spades. He is a gamer and can be incredible working off platform. However, none of those descriptors feeds directly into what NFL General Managers are looking for.\n\nAlso, like Tebow, pocket presence and discipline, elite arm talent, command of the offense, a willingness to win within structure and an instinctive ability to put the ball where it needs to be, are not aspects that describe Pavia.\n\nMcShay is a respected analyst that doesn’t pick favorites unless the game tape dictates this over that. While McShay’s take is not divine football mandate, it does carry some weight. Recently, McShay articulated a growing concern with Pavia.\n\n“I don’t know if Diego Pavia can play quarterback in the NFL. You watch him during the team sessions and 7-on-7s and there’s some fun things to watch, man,” McShay Said. “He just has unbelievable instincts. But when you watch him in 1-on-1s, having to drive the ball, make NFL throws, it's not the same as the other guys.”\n\nThat is the issue in a nutshell. Pavia is small, not particularly fast on the move, does some creative things, but lacks the skill set NFL teams are looking for.\n\n“It’s not like he did it in the WAC or FCS. He did it in the SEC. So it’s hard to say definitively that this guy can’t play in the NFL. I’m not saying that. I’m saying when you watch him out ther, you start to wonder, are the limitations going to be too much in the NFL?”\n\nOnce the pre Draft process gets into he weeds so to speak around March and April, another growing concept will take shape. Success in the college football wins and losses metric does not necessarily equal high draft pick.\n\nAn interesting corollary is Shedeur Sanders.  Not in play style, but in narratives. In 2024 Sanders put up a stat line of 74% completion percentage, almost 4,200 yards and 37 touchdowns to 10 interceptions. In 2025 Pavia put up a stat line of 70% completion percentage, almost 3,600 yards and 29 touchdowns to eight interceptions.\n\nDespite his on-field numbers there was enough that NFL front offices didn't like about Sanders, likely off the field, that he was drafted No. 144 in the 5th round. The largest divider between Sanders and Pavia is style of play. Sanders is a pocket passer who by and large, works within the framework of the offense. Yet it could be more of what was said and done during the pre-Draft process that impacted Sanders' stock the most.\n\nPavia started off the pre-Draft process poorly. When head coach Clark Lea attempted to schedule an additional game to improve Vanderbilt’s playoff chances, that was supported by Pavia. Later, Pavia would reach out via Twitter asking for legislative help from the President of the United States. Both moves were not received well.\n\nThe Heisman Trophy presentation offered two issues of concern. The first of which was simply confirmation of a commonly held idea. Pavia is strikingly small. The second of which might be more concerning. When Pavia did not win the Heisman, he went scorched earth mode. Criticizing Heisman voters and casting a shadow over the entire proceedings.\n\nMore:Nebraska finally admits Big Ten hasn't worked and wanted out\n\nPavia’s Senior Bowl performance was not good. Many media outlets celebrated his success at the Senior Bowl, due in large part to a sentiment from practice. Pavia was voted by his Senior Bowl teammates as one of the better practice players.\n\nHowever, the positive practices and vote of confidence from his teammates did not translate to the game. Pavia’s size, footwork as well as his passing technique and delivery were all some varying degree of not good.\n\nAs the pre-Draft process continues with the Scouting Combine and the Vanderbilt pro day still to be performed, more clarity would come to light on Pavia’s draft stock. However, in the early going, it is not looking promising for Pavia’s long term NFL success.\n\nMore:Diego Pavia's Senior Bowl game tape tells a different story\n\nThe Vanderbilt quarterback has said since the season ended that he was the best player in the 2026 NFL Draft. It will take more than soundbites to convince NFL front offices to take a chance on him. If he can’t convince teams of that, his draft stock might be less than Sanders’ was. Putting him deep in Day 3, if drafted at all.\n\nOregon's Dan Lanning rips College Football Playoff, calls for major changes\n\nDeion Sanders buyout, contract details as Colorado Buffaloes coach\n\nFormer Colorado All-American blasts Deion Sanders and son\n\nDabo Swinney fires Clemson coaches immediately after loss to Penn State\n\nOhio State's Ryan Day faces backlash after Cotton Bowl",

    "fullText": "There seems to be some confusion at the moment regarding the rules of fighting in hockey at the Olympic Winter Games. On Sunday in the game between Canada and France, Pierre Crinon of France fought Tom Wilson of Canada.\n\nThis was the first Olympic hockey fight since 1998 according to the Rogers Sportsnet, and there was a belief by many that there would be supplementary discipline. Then the International Ice Hockey Federation made the surprise announcement that there would be no more further discipline against Crinon and Wilson, as they both received game misconducts for their fights.\n\nMany who are part of the hockey world have always been of the understanding that fighting was simply not part of Olympic hockey. What happens when there actually is a fight?\n\nIn what we found out, players are not banned from the tournament, they are just banned from one particular game.\n\nThe president of the French Ice Hockey Federation, Pierre-Yves Gerbeau, was very dissatisfied with the fight. According to Luke Fox of Sportsnet, Gerbeau believed Crinon’s behaviour was “provocative” and stated the following about his participation in the fight:\n\n“(It was) a clear violation of the Olympic spirit and also undermines the values of our sport.”\n\nOne needs to realize that France has a history of emphasizing the importance that the athletes prioritize the Olympic Spirit. That is because the founder of the International Olympic Committee was Pierre de Coubertin of France, who established the Olympic Oath.\n\nPrior to the start of the Olympic tournament, many including me, were surprised that Wilson made Team Canada at all because of his lack of discipline throughout his hockey career. He has been suspended on multiple occasions.\n\nWilson has 1610 penalty minutes in 885 games. There is a belief he made Team Canada to generate energy throughout the lineup, and is lucky that he was not suspended by the powers that be either.\n\nOLYMPICS: 2026 Winter Olympics medal count, standings entering February 16\n\nNFL Draft: 3 shocking 2026 NFL Combine snubs, full list of prospects attending\n\nNFL: Tennessee Titans’ new logo leaked in Fanatics mishap?\n\nENTERTAINMENT: Logan Paul’s Pikachu Illustrator sale price sets Guinness World Record\n\nNEWS: Nancy Guthrie kidnapping case reportedly gets DNA breakthrough\n\nVIRAL: Chloe Kim ‘obsessed’ with $100k gift from NFL star Myles Garrett after Olympics\n\nThe post French Hockey suspends Pierre Crinon for fighting Tom Wilson appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "Could the Denver Broncos make this happen?",
    "fullText": "Broncos' 'dream' trade scenario could be more available than ever originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAs the 2026 NFL offseason begins to take shape, the Denver Broncos will be peppered with questions concerning how they choose to address upgrading the offense. Though the team went 14-3 in 2025, it seems obvious that they need more playmakers.\n\nThe team needs a productive, game-changing player at the wide receiver position. The Broncos have lacked that for years. Options such as A.J. Brown, Tyreek Hill George Pickens are going to be discussed, but a team already going through major changes this offseason may have the answer in a player the Broncos took a look at last year.\n\nThe Miami Dolphins have already parted ways with Hill, Bradley Chubb and Nick Westbrook-Ikhine in an effort to create more room under the salary cap and begin to overhaul their roster. You might remember ahead of the trade deadline this past season when reports came out that the Broncos were interested in Dolphins receiver Jaylen Waddle.\n\nAt the time, it was reported that the Dolphins were asking for too much in return. However, could that option be more available now with the Dolphins turning the roster over?\n\nMoe Moton of Bleacher Report suggests that this is the dream trade scenario for the Broncos this offseason. Here were his thoughts:\n\n\"This is a long-shot dream scenario, but not far-fetched given the Miami Dolphins' roster turnover on Monday.\n\nThe Dolphins have a new general manager and coaching staff that may continue to tear down the roster in a full-blown rebuild. Jaylen Waddle has a tradeable contract that only counts $11.6 million against the salary cap.\n\nThe Denver Broncos may have to overpay in draft compensation to acquire Waddle, but it may be worth it while in a Super Bowl window.\n\nThe Broncos need more big plays in the passing game. Courtland Sutton averaged 13.7 yards per catch, but Troy Franklin, Marvin Mims Jr., and Evan Engram all averaged fewer than 11 yards per grab. As a rookie, Pat Bryant averaged 12.2 yards per reception, but he struggled to stay healthy late in the season.\n\nIn 2025, Waddle played through injuries. He only missed one game and racked up 14.2 yards per reception. The 27-year-old doesn't have the accolades of a premier wideout, but his playmaking ability would move the needle for Denver's aerial attack.\n\nRemember, according to NFL insider Jordan Schultz, the Broncos \"reached out\" to the Dolphins about Waddle's availability before the 2025 trade deadline.\"\n\nThis is a move that makes sense, even if it doesn't bring the Broncos that \"superstar\" that so many feel they need.\n\nWaddle is still one of the fastest wide receivers in the league and he could threaten defenses deep down the field, allowing things to open up more for Bo Nix and the offensive attack. The big question would be, do the Dolphins want to move on from Hill and Waddle in the same offseason?\n\nMORE:Broncos have to be out on Breece Hall if Jets make predicted move\n\nFor a team that will almost certainly have a new starting quarterback in 2026, it seems that keeping at least one proven option on the roster is a good idea. Still, it wouldn't hurt for George Paton to place a phone call and see what that price tag looks like now.\n\nBroncos not named as potential landing spot for Tyreek Hill following Dolphins release\n\nBroncos may be getting an idea of cost for A.J.

    "fullText": "José Mourinho addressed the racist abuse involving Vinícius Júnior during Benfica’s Champions League match against Real Madrid on Tuesday night at the Estádio da Luz.\n\nReal Madrid won the match 1–0, with Vinícius scoring the decisive goal. In the second half, play was stopped for around 10 minutes after Vinícius reported comments made by Benfica player Gianluca Prestianni. The referee activated the anti-racism protocol before the match eventually resumed.\n\nSpeaking after the match, Mourinho said he did not want to take sides between the two players but suggested Vinícius’ celebration contributed to the situation.\n\n“I told him [Vinicius] – when you score a goal like that, you just celebrate and walk back,” Mourinho said.\n\n“His talents allow him to do these beautiful things, but unfortunately, he was not just happy to score that astonishing goal. When you score a goal like that, you celebrate in a respectful way.”\n\nMourinho also defended Benfica as a club, pointing to its history and identity.\n\n“When he was arguing about racism, I told him the biggest person [Eusebio] in the history of this club was Black,” Mourinho said.\n\n“This club, the last thing that it is, is racist. If in his mind there was something in relation to that – this in Benfica. They [Vinicius and Prestianni] told me different things. But I don’t believe in one or another. I want to be an independent.”\n\nMourinho added that incidents involving Vinícius have occurred in multiple stadiums.\n\n“There is something wrong because it happens in every stadium,” Mourinho said. “A stadium where Vinicius plays something happens, always.”\n\nThe incident remains under discussion following the match, with Vinícius having already spoken publicly about the situation in a social media statement earlier in the evening.\n\nReal Madrid’s win in Lisbon secured an important Champions League result, though the match was overshadowed by the abhorrent events.",

    "title": "Why an A.I. Video of Tom Cruise Battling Brad Pitt Spooked Hollywood",
    "description": "A 15-second clip created by an artificial intelligence tool owned by the Chinese technology company ByteDance appears more cinematic than anything so far.",
    "fullText": "It took only a 15-second clip of Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt duking it out on a crumbling rooftop at twilight to draw swift outrage, and sizable fear, from Hollywood over the last few days.\n\nThe widely circulated video was created by the Irish director Ruairi Robinson using Seedance 2.0, a powerful artificial intelligence video generation tool owned by the Chinese technology company ByteDance. It had plenty of the bells and whistles of a big-budget Hollywood film: sweeping camera angles, stunt choreography, crisp sound effects and haunting music.\n\nWith a two-sentence prompt and the click of a button, Seedance had produced a stunningly realistic result that was a drastic improvement over previously generated artificial intelligence videos, often shoddy clips known as A.I. slop. This video was so convincing that it drew near immediate condemnation from some of Hollywood’s top organizations and companies.\n\nRhett Reese, a scriptwriter known for his “Deadpool” films, said in an interview that the Cruise-Pitt video had sent a “cold shiver” up his spine.\n\n“For all of us who work in the industry and devoted our careers and lives to it, I just think it’s nothing short of terrifying,” he said. “I could just see it costing jobs all over the place.”\n\nByteDance released Seedance 2.0 last week, nearly two months after a previous version had failed to prompt much anger. A news release from the company praised the updated tool’s “physical accuracy, realism and controllability,” which it said was suitable for the needs of “professional-grade creative scenarios.”\n\n“The creation process,” the release went on, “is more natural and efficient, allowing users to control their creations like a true ‘director.’”\n\nUsers promptly flocked to the platform to spin up their own content. An alternate ending to “Game of Thrones” went viral, as did a video of the notoriously beefing rappers Kendrick Lamar and Drake burying the hatchet on “The Tonight Show,” and one of Samara Morgan, the vengeful girl in “The Ring” horror films, emerging from an old television set to pet a cat.\n\nRobinson himself posted additional videos, including of Pitt and Cruise battling a robot, and of Pitt sparring with a sword-wielding “zombie ninja.”\n\nAt the same time, Hollywood was swift to sit up straight. Charles Rivkin, the chairman and chief executive of the Motion Picture Association, called on ByteDance to “immediately cease its infringing activity,” saying in a statement that Seedance 2.0 had engaged in the unauthorized use of copyrighted works on a “massive scale.” Human Artistry Campaign, a global coalition that advocates using A.I. “with respect for the irreplaceable artists, performers and creatives,” said on social media that unauthorized works generated by Seedance 2.0 violated the “most basic aspects of personal autonomy.”\n\nDisney, which in a watershed $1 billion deal last year agreed to allow OpenAI’s Sora users to generate video content with its characters, sent a cease-and-desist letter to ByteDance, accusing it of supplying Seedance with a “pirated library” of Disney’s characters — “as if Disney’s coveted intellectual property were free public-domain clip art.”\n\nByteDance, which also owns TikTok and has been valued at $480 billion in the private markets, said in a statement that it respected intellectual property rights and was aware of the concerns about Seedance.\n\n“We are taking steps to strengthen current safeguards as we work to prevent the unauthorized use of intellectual property and likeness by users,” the statement said.\n\nAs last year’s deal between Disney and OpenAI suggests, Hollywood has for years wrestled with how to manage the rapid growth of generative artificial intelligence. The concerns outlined by Reese echoed the Writers Guild strike in 2023, when for months thousands of union members demanded that studios institute guardrails protecting them from having their jobs or their intellectual property stolen by A.I. In the end, the group won guarantees that A.I. would not encroach on writers’ credits and compensation.\n\nDuncan Crabtree-Ireland, the national executive director and chief negotiator of SAG-AFTRA, which represents actors and media artists, said its contracts had specific and enforceable rules about digital replication. The kind of material represented by the Cruise-Pitt battle, he said, “could not be produced by any of the signatories to our contracts — the studios, the streamers — without the specific, informed consent of those individuals.”\n\nAccording to Crabtree-Ireland, the real concern is that, even if videos generated by Seedance and other A.I. platforms “are not malicious in intent,” they could “really violate someone’s right to control how their image, their likeness and their voice is used.”\n\nNot everyone is awed by Seedance’s latest technology. Heather Anne Campbell, an executive producer and a writer on the animated series “Rick and Morty,” said her social media accounts last week had been inundated with Seedance-generated clips of anime, sci-fi and unlikely superhero battles. But she is not yet worried, she said, about losing her job to the technology.\n\n“Everybody is, I think, swept up by the circus that came to town and is showing off,” she said. “I haven’t seen anything good yet. Nothing that has taken my breath away, nothing that is poignant, nothing that is provocative even. It’s all just garbage.”\n\nCampbell added that A.I. services like Seedance were at best “averaging machines,” and argued that the greatest art was never made quickly or impersonally.\n\nStill, some people working in Hollywood find it difficult to imagine that studios will not come to see A.I. as a cost-saving shortcut. “It would be cheaper to have A.I. write a screenplay than it would be for me to write a screenplay,” Reese, the “Deadpool” writer, said. “I just know that in the back of my mind, that’s where the terror comes from.”\n\nFor Reese, a long-term answer to the unease that A.I. will reorder Hollywood could not come quickly enough.\n\n“If I could wave my magic wand and make A.I. go away, at least in the creative field,” he said, “I would absolutely wave the wand.”",

    "title": "Frederick Wiseman, 96, Penetrating Documentarian of Institutions, Dies",
    "description": "He exposed abuses in films like “Titicut Follies,” a once-banned portrait of a mental hospital, but ranged widely in subject matter, from a Queens neighborhood to a French restaurant.",
    "fullText": "Frederick Wiseman, a director whose rigorously objective explorations of social and cultural institutions constitute one of the more revered bodies of work in American documentary filmmaking, died on Monday at his home in Cambridge, Mass. He was 96.\n\nHis family announced the death through Zipporah Films, the distribution company he founded in 1971.\n\nMr. Wiseman, who received an honorary Academy Award in 2016, was among the most influential directors of nonfiction cinema.\n\nHe consistently dismissed categorizations of his work. “I like to call them films” rather than documentaries, he said, because he found the word “documentary” limiting. But he was as closely associated as anyone with the vérité documentary.\n\nAnd though he denied that his movies had any political agenda, he was no stranger to controversy. His directorial debut, “Titicut Follies” (1967), a harrowing portrait of the Bridgewater State Hospital for the criminally insane in Massachusetts, remains the only film ever banned in the United States for reasons other than obscenity, immorality or national security. (The ban, imposed by Massachusetts on the grounds that the film violated the inmates’ privacy, was lifted in 1991; the film subsequently aired on PBS.)\n\nMr. Wiseman’s last films were among his best received. The novelist Jay Neugeboren, writing in The New York Review of Books, called “In Jackson Heights” (2015), a panoramic portrait of one of the country’s most diverse neighborhoods, in Queens, the “most richly textured and sumptuously beautiful” of Wiseman’s documentaries. Reviewing “Ex Libris: The New York Public Library” (2017) for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis called it “one of the greatest movies of Mr. Wiseman’s extraordinary career and one of his most thrilling.”\n\nSince then, Mr. Wiseman had released “Monrovia, Indiana” (2018), a study of small-town Middle America; the long-in-the-works “City Hall” (2020), a four-and-a-half-hour examination of urban bureaucracy set in Boston, his hometown; and “Menus-Plaisirs — Les Troisgros” (2023), a loving four-hour dissection of a three-Michelin-star French restaurant and the family that runs it.\n\n“Titicut Follies” became the stylistic template for Mr. Wiseman’s subsequent films, which were free of narration and shot with available light, and which often concerned public institutions and the abuses therein. Among his better-known works are “High School” (1968), “Welfare” (1975), “Public Housing” (1997) and “Domestic Violence” (2002).\n\nUncovering governmental or administrative malfeasance, however, was never his aim.\n\n“There’s a common assumption that my movies are exposés,” Mr. Wiseman said in a 2011 interview for this obituary, “and I don’t think they are. You can certainly argue that a movie like ‘Titicut Follies’ is in part an exposé, but you couldn’t make a movie about Bridgewater without showing how horrible it was.”\n\nHe added: “There are people who think if I don’t make a movie about how poor people are being taken advantage of by the system, it’s not a real Fred Wiseman movie. And I think that shows a complete misunderstanding about what I’m doing.”\n\nMr. Wiseman was born on New Year’s Day 1930 in Boston. His father, Jacob, was a lawyer whose work involved helping Jewish émigrés escape an increasingly antisemitic Europe. His mother, Gertrude, had aspired to be an actress, only to have her dream thwarted by her father. Mr. Wiseman’s interest in theater was kindled by his mother’s uncanny talent as a mimic.\n\nThe other reason for his attending Yale was the Korean War draft. “Even law school seemed to be, to my keen analytical mind, a better alternative than going to war,” Mr. Wiseman wrote.\n\nLaw school resulted, however obliquely, in Mr. Wiseman’s career as a documentarian. Upon leaving Yale in 1954 he was drafted anyway. He became a clerk typist, was trained as a court reporter at the University of Virginia and was assigned to the judge advocate general’s office at Fort Benning, Ga. Looking to take advantage of an Army regulation that allowed early discharge to soldiers who planned to attend school, he applied and was admitted to the Sorbonne, and studied law in Paris on the G.I. Bill.\n\nThis was followed by a position at Boston University School of Law, where Mr. Wiseman taught subjects he later claimed to know little about: legal writing, legal medicine, family law and copyright. To compensate for his lack of expertise, he recalled, he would take students on field trips to places “where defendants would end up if they were poorly represented or overzealously prosecuted.” One of those places was the Bridgewater hospital.\n\nMr. Wiseman’s one brush with filmmaking before “Titicut Follies” was as the producer of “The Cool World” (1963), a drama directed by Shirley Clarke and adapted from a Warren Miller novel of the same name that Mr. Wiseman liked so much that he acquired the rights. The experience of producing that movie, he later said, persuaded him to direct and edit his own films.\n\nHis relationship with the superintendent at Bridgewater, which he had visited frequently with students, opened the doors to the making of “Titicut Follies.” (“Titicut” is a Native American word that refers to the nearby Taunton River.) This set him on the path to making several dozen other documentaries, most of which take an unblinking, aesthetically spare look at unlit corners of American life.\n\nAlthough his subject matter was almost always American, he occasionally ventured abroad to tackle subjects that were, in his words, “not possible in America,” in films like “La Comédie-Française ou L’Amour Joué” (1996), “La Danse: The Paris Opera Ballet” (2009) and “Crazy Horse” (2011), about the erotic nightclub of the same name in Paris.\n\n“I don’t know if I can offer a general definition of what I’m doing,” Mr. Wiseman said in 2011, “except to say I’m trying to create dramatic structures out of ordinary experience, under a variety of differing circumstances, so the cumulative effect will be a series of thematically interrelated films that record how people thought and lived and worked over the course of time that I made the movies. And how that behavior is in part reflected in institutions. And how institutions are to a certain extent microcosms for a larger society.\n\n“I try to avoid definitions or theories,” he continued. “That’s a sort of general statement, which I don’t particularly like having made. But I just made it.”\n\nMr. Wiseman’s approach to his films — shot in what he wryly referred to as “wobblyscope,” thanks to his hand-held camera — was perhaps never better expressed than during a face-off with his fellow documentarian Werner Herzog, onstage at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival.\n\nMr. Herzog, who had been espousing a theory of “ecstatic truth” and a willingness to manipulate his nonfiction films to achieve something sublime, confided to the audience that a shot apparently made through a dewdrop in his film “The White Diamond” had actually been made through a leaf to which glycerin had been applied. Asked whether he had ever done anything similar, or would, Mr. Wiseman said he had not, but admitted that he might change a lightbulb if a room seemed too dark.\n\nChanging his films was another story. Likening him to Howard Roark, the hero of Ayn Rand’s novel “The Fountainhead,” the filmmaker Errol Morris, a fan of Mr. Wiseman’s work, said Mr. Wiseman “would rather blow up the building he designed than remove a doorknob.” The result, over the years, has included films of virtually unparalleled length — his 1989 film “Near Death,” set in a Boston hospital, is nearly six hours long — and a consequent lack of commercial viability.\n\n“You’d think it would be easy for me to raise money because I’ve made a lot of movies,” Mr. Wiseman said. “But it’s not.”\n\nThe only time filmmaking was not a financial struggle for him was from 1971 to 1981, when he had two five-year contracts with WNET, the New York public television station, arranged by Fred W. Friendly, then with the Ford Foundation.\n\n“That was nirvana,” Mr. Wiseman recalled, “because I knew I could just go from film to film without stopping to raise money. WNET certainly had to approve the subject matter. But they never disapproved of the subject matter.”\n\nHe added, “The cliché about political pressure, as far as I’m concerned, is a nonissue.” With the exception of “Titicut Follies,” the only Wiseman film that became a subject of contention was “The Garden,” his 2004 movie about Madison Square Garden, which remains unreleased.\n\n“They brought suit,” he said of the Garden’s owners, “and I countersued. But the reason the film hasn’t been shown hasn’t to do with the Garden; we worked out our differences. The reason the film hasn’t been seen is over whether I could get permission to use some of the music, complicated by the fact that originally it was my assumption that the Garden had made all of those arrangements. Someday it will be.”\n\nMr. Wiseman is survived by his two sons, David and Eric, and three grandchildren. He met his wife, Zipporah Batshaw Wiseman, at Yale in 1954, and they married in 1955. She died in 2021 after a distinguished legal career.\n\nIn addition to his honorary Academy Award, Mr. Wiseman received honors including a career achievement award from the Los Angeles Film Society in 2013 and the Golden Lion for lifetime achievement from the Venice Film Festival in 2014. He never won a competitive Oscar, but he won Emmy Awards for the documentaries “Law and Order” (1969) and “Hospital” (1970).\n\nAlthough Mr. Wiseman was a role model for generations of idealistic documentarians, his own view of the genre was the opposite of misty-eyed.\n\n“I don’t know what causes social change,” he said in 2011. “But I don’t think it is documentary filmmaking. It’s one thing to start out with a naïve belief or the pious wish that that would be the case, but it certainly is not the case, and it’s ultimately a naïve and presumptuous view.”\n\nMr. Wiseman edited virtually all his own films. “A fiction film has a script,” he said, “so at the very least the chronology is determined in advance. But a documentary film of the kind I make, it’s reversed: I write the script in the editing.”\n\nHe continued: “I’m not saying there aren’t choices in the editing in a fiction film, because of course there are. But the range of choices aren’t anywhere near as great as they are in a documentary.”\n\nIn “La Danse,” for example, he turned about 150 hours of raw footage into a film of 2 hours 45 minutes, so “the ratio of film shot to film used was about 50 to 1.”\n\nShooting so much, Mr. Wiseman said, was just a logical result of the nature of his artistic pursuit. “I am trying to harvest a crop,” he said, “which I have not planted, and which may not exist.”",

    "fullText": "SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Nvidia on Tuesday said it has signed a multiyear deal to sell Meta Platforms millions of its current ‌and future artificial intelligence chips, including central processing units that compete ‌with products from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nNvidia did not disclose a value for the deal, ​but said it includes its current Blackwell chips as well as its forthcoming Rubin AI chips. It also includes standalone installations of its Grace and Vera central processors.\n\nNvidia introduced those central processors, based on technology from Arm Holdings, as companions to its ‌AI chips starting 2023. ⁠But the announcement Tuesday signaled that Nvidia aims to push those chips for emerging fields such as running AI agents as ⁠well as into markets for processors used in workaday technical tasks such as running databases.\n\nNvidia's announcement also comes as Meta is developing its own AI chips and is in ​discussions with ​Google about using that company's Tensor Processing ​Unit chips, or TPUs, for ‌AI work.\n\nIan Buck, the general manager of Nvidia's hyperscale and high-performance computing unit, said that Nvidia's Grace central processors have shown they can use half the power for some common tasks such as running databases, with more gains expected for the next generation, Vera.\n\n\"It actually continues down that path and makes it an ‌excellent data center-only CPU for those high-intensity data ​processing back-end operations,\" Buck said. \"Meta has already had ​a chance to get on ​Vera and run some of those workloads. And the results ‌look very promising.\"\n\nWhile Nvidia has never disclosed ​its sales to ​Meta, it is widely believed to be among four customers that made up 61% of its revenue in its most recent fiscal quarter. Moorhead ​said Nvidia likely highlighted the ‌deal to show that it has retained a large business with ​Meta and is gaining traction with its central processor chips.",

    "fullText": "SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) — A Guatemalan driver fleeing a Georgia traffic stop by federal immigration officers crashed into another vehicle, killing a teacher who was headed to work, authorities and school officials said.\n\nOscar Vasquez Lopez, the driver accused of causing the Monday crash just outside of Savannah, remained jailed Tuesday on charges including vehicular homicide, reckless driving and driving without a valid license. Lopez, 38, is in the U.S. illegally, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nImmigration officers were looking for Lopez to enforce an immigration judge's 2024 deportation order, ICE spokesperson Lindsay Williams said Tuesday, noting that Lopez has no other criminal history.\n\nLopez pulled over when ICE officers used sirens and blue lights to initiate a traffic stop, but then drove away when they approached his vehicle, Williams said. Lopez made a U-turn and ran a stop light before he crashed, ICE said in a news release.\n\nAsked if the ICE officers chased Lopez, Williams said: “Chased? I wouldn't say that. They followed him until he crashed.”\n\nWilliams said he didn't know how far Lopez fled before he crashed.\n\n“According to preliminary findings, we believe the pursuit was relatively short in duration and distance,” said Chatham County police spokesperson Betsy Nolen, who noted the investigation is ongoing.\n\nSecurity camera video obtained by WTOC-TV showed a red pickup truck moving at high speed past Herman W. Hesse K-8 School on Monday morning. The footage showed a vehicle with flashing lights follow about five seconds later at a similar speed, and another vehicle with lights flashing pass several seconds after that.\n\nNews video from the crash scene showed one of the vehicles involved in the wreck was a red pickup.\n\nSavannah-Chatham County school officials identified the woman killed as Linda Davis, a special education teacher at the school.\n\nDavis was beloved by the school community, Principal Alonna McMullen said.\n\n“She dedicated her career to ensuring that every child felt supported, valued, and capable of success,\" McMullen said in a news release. \"Her kindness, patience, and enthusiasm created a nurturing environment for her students and inspired those around her.”\n\nThe crash happened less than a half-mile (0.8 kilometers) from the school. Though students were off Monday for Presidents Day, teachers reported to work. Davis was driving to school when she was killed, school system spokesperson Sheila Blanco said.\n\nLopez remained jailed Tuesday. He is being representing by a public defender in Chatham County, said Don Plummer, a spokesman for the Georgia Public Defender Council.\n\n“We recognize the community’s concern and extend condolences to those harmed,” Plummer said by email. “Mr. Lopez is presumed innocent. We will review the evidence and address it where it belongs — in court, not in the press.”\n\nFederal immigration officers have faced increased scrutiny for their aggressive tactics during the Trump administration's nationwide crackdown on illegal immigration, especially since they shot and killed Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.\n\nIn a statement, Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, blamed “politicians and the media constantly demonizing ICE officers and encouraging those here illegally to resist arrest.”\n\nChatham County police said in a statement that they were unaware of the ICE operation and traffic stop before the deadly crash.\n\nChester Ellis, chairman of the Chatham County Board of Commissioners, noted that county police are constrained by a policy that allows vehicle pursuits only when officers believe a suspect has committed or is attempting to commit a violent felony. But he said county officers, had ICE requested their assistance, could have helped cut off the suspect's escape without a pursuit that endangered other drivers.\n\n“If that had been the case yesterday, then Dr. Davis would still be alive,” Ellis said. “My personal feeling is that one life lost is too many, especially when you’re taking about a precious teacher.”\n\nSavannah Mayor Van Johnson also questioned whether Davis' death might have been prevented.\n\n“I’ve always been and remain very concerned about the activities of ICE in cities, particularly where they’re not coordinating or communicating,” Johnson, a former police officer, told reporters Tuesday.\n\nHe added: “What this individual was wanted for, did it necessitate the end result?\"",

    "description": "Juliette Bryant says not long after meeting Jeffrey Epstein, he assaulted her, and she realized, \"this is not a modeling opportunity, I've been kidnapped.\"",
    "fullText": "Juliette Bryant says she first met Jeffrey Epstein when she was a 20-year-old psychology and philosophy student in Cape Town, South Africa, who modeled part time.\n\nHer first interaction with the late American sex offender came by chance, when she was approached on a night out by a girl who offered to introduce her to a man who she said was described to her as American royalty.\n\n\"She said she knew a man who was here who was the 'King Of America,' and he was here with Bill Clinton and Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker. She told me that his best friend Leslie Wexner owns Victoria's Secret and it would be a very good idea for me to meet them because it could possibly help with my modeling career,\" Bryant told CBS News on Sunday. \"So we went along to the restaurant where they were having dinner down the road. And sure enough, there they were. Bill Clinton, Kevin Spacey, Chris Tucker, Jeffrey Epstein, and a few government officials from South Africa.\"\n\nBryant does not accuse Clinton, Spacey or Tucker of any wrongdoing, and she said her interaction with the men at the table was brief, lasting only about five minutes.\n\nBut the next day she received a call from the girl who made the introduction, telling her that Epstein would like to see her modeling portfolio.\n\n\"Epstein said he thought I'd be great for Victoria's Secret, and they left that day, but his office started phoning and arranging me a visa and tickets and everything,\" Bryant told CBS News. \"You know, I didn't have money or anything, but they said don't worry, they will deduct all my expenses from the income I made when I was there.\"\n\nBryant, a South African national, said she was surprised by how quickly Epstein was able to arrange for her travel to the United States.\n\n\"They arranged for me to get a visa to come to America. It was like a visitor's visa … and they arranged these visas very quickly, which is unusual in South Africa. It's usually very difficult to get a visa here. And then basically within three weeks, I was in America,\" she said.\n\nMultiple emails in the tranche of Epstein-related documents released by the Department of Justice and reviewed by CBS News appear to show a pattern of Epstein assisting or receiving legal counsel on how to secure visas for young women to come to the U.S., including from Eastern Europe.\n\nThe Free Press: WATCH: The Epstein Tapes\n\nEarlier this month, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced that the Polish government would create an analytical team to examine whether Polish children were abused via criminal networks connected to Epstein. Tusk also said \"links between Epstein and the entire pedophile circle and the Russian special services,\" would be investigated.\n\nBryant said very soon after she arrived in New York, she was told she would be heading to the Caribbean, to Epstein's private island.\n\n\"I obviously assumed it was for a modeling shoot,\" she said. \"We went to Teterboro airport and they were waiting on the airplane there, and you know, nothing was ever checked at any of these airports. They didn't check our passports, our luggage, nothing.\"\n\nBryant said her passport was taken from her on board, and she was then sexually assaulted.\n\n\"As the airplane took off, he [Epstein] started touching me forcibly in between my legs, and I freaked out. I realized, this is not a modeling opportunity, I've been kidnapped,\" Bryant told CBS News. \"They whisked me away to the island and then I was stuck there. They never arranged any modeling opportunities, I was basically completely conned.\"\n\nBryant said that for the next few years of her life, she was trafficked by Epstein. Her account of where she first met Epstein lines up with a time period during which Epstein lent his plane to former President Bill Clinton as part of a Clinton Foundation trip to Africa.\n\nBryant was eventually compensated as part of both the Epstein Victims' Compensation Program in 2020 and a separate settlement with JP Morgan Chase in 2023.\n\nPublic flight logs reviewed by CBS News show that Clinton left for a nine-day trip to Africa with actors Spacey and Tucker, on Epstein's private plane, in September 2002, visiting Ghana, Nigeria, Rwanda, Mozambique and South Africa.\n\nKFF Health News reported at the time that Clinton, Tucker and Spacey were on a Clinton Foundation trip to \"promote efforts to fight HIV/AIDS and economic development.\"\n\nIn a sworn declaration to the House Oversight Committee in January, Clinton said Epstein offered use of his private plane for himself, his staff and his Secret Service detail in support of the Clinton Foundation's philanthropic work between 2002 and 2003.\n\nClinton denied ever visiting Epstein's private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where a number of the late financier's crimes occurred, and maintained that he had not been in contact with the convicted pedophile for more than a decade before his 2019 arrest.\n\nInvestigators reviewing retail sales records for clues in Nancy Guthrie case\n\nInvestigators chase critical leads as Nancy Guthrie search enters third week\n\nMiracle babies of Mauthausen find each other decades after the Holocaust | 60 Minutes",

    "fullText": "Editor’s note: The opening date has been changed, along with the pricing tiers. The changes have been reflected in the story below.\n\n(KRON) — Last summer, a fast-rising Japanese BBQ chain based in Los Angeles announced its first Bay Area locations would open in Pleasanton, Milpitas and Santa Clara.\n\nChubby Cattle first opened only three years ago in Monterey Park (Los Angeles County), but the chain has quickly risen in popularity — already expanding with its first Bay Area outpost in Pleasanton.\n\nThe group behind Chubby Cattle is now opening a new concept for all-you-can-eat Japanese Wagyu, owners Chubby Group announced in a press release. The restaurant is named “Wagyu Master” and will open by the end of the month.\n\nWagyu Master is located at 1410 El Paseo de Saratoga and takes over a space that was previously occupied by The Melt and Tabu Shabu. It is located within the El Paseo de Saratoga shopping center.\n\nTentatively, Wagyu Master plans to open by Feb. 20, but if that does not happen, it will open before February ends, according to a restaurant representative. The San Jose location marks Chubby Group’s second “Wagyu Master” restaurant — the first debuting in Pasadena on Dec. 31, 2025.\n\nThe concept claims to be the first all-you-can-eat restaurant with 100% Japanese Wagyu, according to the Wagyu Group news release.\n\nMassive SF-based Asian restaurant opening at Westfield Valley Fair\n\nBad Bunny rents out Bay Area restaurant after Super Bowl halftime show\n\nWagyu Master offers two tiers for all-you-can-eat Wagyu.\n\nBoth tiers have access to the restaurant’s buffet line, which includes unlimited milk tea, desserts and other side dishes. Under both pricing options, there will be Zensai appetizers, chef speciality dishes, A5 Ribeye, A5 Striploin, vegetables, shime course and dessets.\n\nThe buffet has at least 80 items, highlighted by Crispy Squab, Beijing-Style Giant Wing, Charred Tongue Heart, live crab, and lobster specialties.\n\nAccording to the press release, Wagyu Master sources its Wagyu from Japan’s largest Wagyu supplier.\n\n“The future of dining is here — introducing Wagyu Master Pasadena, the first All-You-Can-Eat Shabu in the U.S. featuring 100% Japanese Wagyu,” Chubby Group founding partner David Zhao wrote on LinkedIn. “An authentic, premium experience that brings together craftsmanship, innovation, and community dining — all in one table.”\n\nChubby Cattle’s first location opened in April 2023 and has gained a social media fanbase of more than 25,000 Instagram followers.",

    "description": "The High-Speed Rail Authority said it was aware of the matter and reviewing it after the Feb. 3 arrest in Folsom.",
    "fullText": "The CEO of the embattled California High-Speed Rail Authority was one of two people arrested this month at his Folsom home following an alleged domestic disturbance between his fiancee and his daughter, hours after appearing beside Gov. Gavin Newsom at a rail event in Kern County.\n\nAccording to Folsom police logs, Ian Choudri, 57, was arrested just after midnight Feb. 4 after officers were called to his home. Police said officers responded to the residence and took Choudri and his fiancée, Lyudmyla Starostyuk, 46, into custody on suspicion of misdemeanor battery. A spokesperson for the Folsom Police Department confirmed the arrest and said both were booked and released from the Sacramento County Main Jail downtown.\n\nAllen Sawyer, an attorney for Choudri and Starostyuk, said the Sacramento County District Attorney’s Office “immediately” declined to file charges after Folsom police forwarded the incident.\n\n“Mr. Choudri was never asked to appear in court,” Sawyer said in an email Monday night. He added that “this matter is over and no further action will be taken.”\n\nAccording to dispatch recordings reviewed by The Sacramento Bee, Choudri was arrested after officers were called to the home for an alleged fight between Starostyuk and Choudri’s 17-year-old daughter. Dispatchers relayed to officers that Starostyuk had “pulled her hair and pushed her” before locking her out of the house. It was not clear who made the call to 911, but all three residents were outside the home when police arrived.\n\nChoudri and Starostyuk, a former professor at Metropolitan State University of Denver, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The police spokesperson said the department does not comment on specifics of arrests, referring further questions to the DA’s Office.\n\nThe District Attorney’s Office in a statement Tuesday said its investigators did not find sufficient evidence to charge Choudri before his expected arraignment on Feb. 6 because they could not determine a clear “dominate aggressor” in the incident.\n\n“Our office takes all allegations of domestic violence incredibly seriously, regardless of who the suspect is or what position they hold in our community,” the DA’s Office said in the statement. “Per Penal Code section 13701, in domestic violence situations law enforcement shall take steps to determine who the ‘dominant aggressor’ is to make the appropriate arrest. In this case, law enforcement arrested one male and one female. Officers did not see or note any injuries to either individual.”\n\n“Since the evidence does not clearly demonstrate a ‘dominant aggressor’ we determined there was insufficient evidence to file charges to sustain our burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt,” it said.\n\nThe arrest occurred hours after Choudri appeared with Gov. Gavin Newsom at a High-Speed Rail Authority facility in Kern County, where the governor touted progress on the long-delayed project and criticized the Trump administration’s decision to pull $4 billion in federal funding.\n\nNewsom’s office referred a request for comment to the High Speed Rail Authority.\n\nChoudri joined Newsom that day to announce the completion of the authority’s 150-acre railhead facility near Shafter, which will serve as a staging area for track construction in the Southern San Joaquin Valley.\n\n“The High-Speed Rail Authority is aware of the matter and is reviewing it,” a spokesperson for the agency said in a statement Monday night.\n\nChoudri was appointed CEO by the authority’s board of directors in August 2024. According to previous Bee reporting, he previously worked on large-scale construction projects in more than 18 countries.\n\nThe Bee’s Daniel Hunt contributed to this story.",

    "fullText": "ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) — A judge on Tuesday granted a request for a hearing to learn more about an investigation that led to charges against former University of Michigan football coach Sherrone Moore, who was arrested soon after he was fired for a relationship with his executive assistant.\n\nIt's a victory for Moore and lawyer Ellen Michaels who is defending him against charges of felony home invasion, stalking and illegal entry. They ultimately want the case dismissed.\n\nMoore, 40, is accused of entering the woman’s apartment without permission and threatening to kill himself in front of her on Dec. 10. Authorities quoted him as saying she was to blame for him losing one of the top college football jobs in the country. She had spoken to university officials.\n\nJudge J. Cedric Simpson expressed concern that a police detective didn’t disclose Moore's employer-employee relationship with the woman — a “glaring omission” — when a magistrate authorized a warrant for his arrest.\n\n“Defendant’s due process may have been violated,” Simpson said.\n\n\"This was not solely this personal relationship. The magistrate should have been able to look at that,\" said the judge, who set a March 2 hearing to hear from police and other witnesses.\n\nThe woman ended the personal relationship a few days before Moore's firing and did not answer a dozen calls or respond to some text messages from him before his dismissal, police said.\n\nMichaels said a coach calling and texting an executive assistant that many times was reasonable while Moore was preparing his team for a bowl game.\n\n“It’s not stalking if the communication has a legitimate purpose,” Michaels said.\n\nBefore Simpson set the hearing, Washtenaw County assistant prosecutor Kati Rezmierski said it wasn't necessary and would be outside the judge's discretion.\n\nMoore coached the Wolverines for two seasons as the successor to Jim Harbaugh, who won a national championship before quitting to become coach of the NFL’s Los Angeles Chargers. Kyle Whittingham, who coached Utah for two decades, is Michigan’s new coach.\n\nMichaels accused the woman's personal lawyer of giving information to police to “villainize Mr. Moore and maximize the chances of obtaining a large settlement from the deep pockets of the University of Michigan.”",

    "title": "Poll: How many Americans rank Trump as the 'worst' vs. 'best' president in U.S. history?",
    "description": "Amid this year's Presidents' Day celebrations, survey respondents tell Yahoo and YouGov that Trump is doing a worse job than Joe Biden and Barack Obama.",
    "fullText": "As Americans return to work and school after the long Presidents’ Day weekend, a new Yahoo/YouGov poll has found that 40% of them now consider Donald Trump to be the “worst president in U.S. history.”\n\nAnother 12% think Trump is “worse than average” — meaning that overall, a majority of Americans (about 53%) now rate Trump as one of the least successful presidents ever to hold the office.\n\nOnly a third of Americans say Trump is either the best president in U.S. history (12%) or better than average (21%). An additional 9% believe Trump “ranks somewhere in the middle.”\n\nThe survey of 1,704 U.S. adults was conducted just before Presidents’ Day, which roughly coincides with George Washington’s birthday and honors the first U.S. president as well as all those who served after him.\n\nHistorians often use Presidents’ Day as an opportunity to rank commanders in chief; the last major tally was published in February 2024 by the Presidential Greatness Project. In it, 154 current and recent members of the American Political Science Association awarded Abraham Lincoln, the top finisher, an average zero-to-100 score of 93.87. Trump finished last, with an average score of 10.92.\n\nBut that was before Trump’s comeback victory the following November — and before the sweeping changes of his first year back in office. So now, two Februaries later, how are ordinary Americans judging Trump’s second term in relation to the presidencies that preceded it?\n\nNot very positively. Trump’s job approval rating (38%) is currently as low as it has ever been; his disapproval rating (58%) is higher than ever. That puts Trump a full 20 points “underwater.” In comparison, former President Joe Biden was about 8 points underwater at this stage of his presidency.\n\nIn particular, independents — who tend to decide elections — have soured on Trump. Before Trump took office again, more independents said they expected him to change America for the better (41%) than said they expected him to change America for the worse (34%). But today, only 23% of independents say Trump is changing America for the better, while a clear majority (57%) say he is changing America for the worse.\n\nAll told, a majority of Americans now say for the first time that Trump is making America worse (52%) rather than better (34%) — and that his second term has turned out to be worse than they expected (51%) instead of better (25%).\n\nAmericans also think Trump is failing to meet the standard of performance set by his immediate Democratic predecessors.\n\nDespite the fact that Trump recently replaced a White House portrait of Biden with a photo of an autopen — and described Biden as “by far, the worst President in American History” on the plaque beneath the image — 49% of Americans think Trump is “doing a worse job than Biden.” Significantly fewer (41%) think Trump is doing a better job than Biden.\n\nAmong independents, a majority (53%) now believe Trump is doing worse than Biden. Just 33% say Trump is doing better.\n\nTrump compares even less favorably to former President Barack Obama — “one of the most divisive political figures in American History,” according to his new White House plaque. A full 55% of Americans think Trump is doing a worse job than Obama. Only 37% think Trump is doing better. Among independents, those numbers are 57% and 16%, respectively.\n\nThe president also faces a widening gap in the intensity of opinion between Americans who think he’s doing a good job and Americans who think he’s doing a bad job. Forty-nine percent now “strongly” disapprove of Trump’s job performance; less than half as many (22%) strongly approve.\n\nThe gap between Americans who consider Trump the worst president in U.S. history and those who consider him the best is similar.\n\nThe Yahoo survey was conducted by YouGov using a nationally representative sample of 1,704 U.S. adults interviewed online from Feb. 9 to 12, 2026. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, education, 2024 election turnout and presidential vote, party identification and current voter registration status. Demographic weighting targets come from the 2019 American Community Survey. Party identification is weighted to the estimated distribution at the time of the election (31% Democratic, 32% Republican). Respondents were selected from YouGov’s opt-in panel to be representative of all U.S. adults. The margin of error is approximately 3%.",

    "description": "The former Texas governor chairs the Lone Star Freedom Project, a group that has already spent almost $18 million boosting Cornyn against Attorney General Ken Paxton and Rep. Wesley Hunt.",
    "fullText": "Stumping with Sen. John Cornyn in Austin on Tuesday, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry said the political group he chairs, called the Lone Star Freedom Project, would spend “whatever we need” to see Cornyn through his bruising Republican primary, on top of the almost $18 million it has spent on his behalf.\n\nCornyn, who is serving his fourth term in the U.S. Senate, is battling to keep his seat against challenges from Attorney General Ken Paxton and U.S. Rep. Wesley Hunt of Houston, in a contest that looks destined to go to a May runoff.\n\nOutside groups, Senate Republican leadership and Cornyn’s own fundraising committees have spent tens of millions of dollars to support the incumbent senator and attack his GOP rivals. The Senate race in Texas became the second-most expensive in the country Tuesday, according to AdImpact, with $98.2 million in total ad spending. Some three-quarters of the cash on the GOP side has come from pro-Cornyn sources — and yet, recent public polling has shown Paxton leading the contest.\n\nPerry’s group has spent more than all but one other group among Cornyn’s several outside backers, who along with the senator’s campaign have dropped nearly $60 million on the race, per AdImpact. The former governor made clear that would continue into the runoff if Cornyn makes it past the March 3 election.\n\n“We are committed to John, and we will spend whatever we need to spend for him to be successful,” Perry said when asked if he thought that level of fundraising and spending would continue.\n\nCornyn, kicking off a 10-stop statewide tour on the first day of early voting, warned that Republicans would see an “Election Day massacre” in November if he loses out on the Senate GOP nomination to Paxton.\n\n“Republicans up and down the ticket will pay the price of having an albatross like the corrupt attorney general hung around their neck,” Cornyn said at a Tex-Mex restaurant alongside Perry and other supporters, where he further argued that Paxton’s nomination could threaten the new red congressional seats Texas Republicans drew last summer to pad their slim House majority. “We haven’t lost a statewide election in Texas since 1994, but we could this year if the wrong person is at the top of the ticket.”\n\nThe senior senator has argued throughout the campaign that he would keep moderate and swing voters in the GOP tent who would otherwise be turned off by Paxton’s ethical baggage — a history that includes indictment, impeachment and federal investigations that the attorney general has all largely withstood.\n\nPaxton, meanwhile, is arguing in his campaign that Cornyn is a relic of the establishment GOP and ideologically out of step with President Donald Trump and his MAGA movement. The third-term attorney general has long been trailed by a list of legal and ethical woes — including securities fraud charges and impeachment by the GOP-controlled Texas House on bribery and abuse of office allegations — from which he has emerged largely unscathed. More recently, Paxton’s wife, state Sen. Angela Paxton, filed for divorce on “biblical grounds” after she accused him of cheating on her.\n\nIn a statement, Paxton adviser Nick Maddux said, “Character matters in this race, and that’s why the people of Texas overwhelmingly support Ken Paxton. They know that he is a conservative warrior who will always fight for us and our freedoms, even in the face of the Left trying to tear him down.”\n\nMaddux added that Cornyn “is just like every other career politician who talks tough during election season, but then does the exact opposite in D.C. and betrays Texas by repeatedly pushing gun control and amnesty.”\n\nTrump on Monday declined to make an endorsement in the primary, telling reporters, “They’ve all supported me, they’re all good and you’re supposed to pick one. So we’ll see what happens, but I support all three.”\n\nIn response, Cornyn said Tuesday that he would be “proud” to have Trump’s endorsement.\n\n“I appreciate his kind words, referring to me as a friend and calling me a good man,” Cornyn said. “The president knows he can trust me to be there to support him and his agenda, and I appreciate that. But it’s going to be up to him to make that call. I think he kind of likes a good fight, and he’s going to see one right here in Texas.”\n\nIn his remarks, Perry praised Cornyn’s work on border security and other conservative causes over his four decades in public office. The two were flanked by representatives from the National Border Patrol Council, which has endorsed Cornyn for reelection.\n\n“The people of the state of Texas know John Cornyn,” Perry said. “They know that character counts. They know that this man is going to go back to Washington, D.C., and day in and day out, deliver for them. What you have is a vanity campaign on the other side and a corrupt campaign on the other side.”\n\nIn a statement, Hunt spokesperson James Kyrkanides accused Perry of parroting talking points from Cornyn’s supporters in Senate GOP leadership and noted how much Cornyn-aligned groups have spent against Hunt.\n\n“If Hunt’s candidacy wasn’t a threat, why would [Perry] spend his own money attacking Wesley?” Kyrkanides said. “On March 3, Texans are going to prove that they’re tired of gutter politics and establishment games. They’re ready for a new generation of leadership.”\n\nAsked if he believed “character” still mattered in a Republican primary contest, Perry said, “We’re fixing to find out. If winning with a corrupt candidate is okay, then it ain’t the Republican Party that I joined in 1989.”\n\nThe Senate primary is Perry’s latest foray into a smashmouth GOP contest in his home state, after he campaigned for then-Texas House Speaker Dade Phelan in 2024 and helped the Beaumont Republican narrowly overcome a hardline challenger backed by Paxton. Perry also published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal ahead of Paxton’s impeachment trial in which he implied that state senators should reject Paxton’s efforts to dismiss the case.\n\nPaxton is also embarking on a get-out-the-vote tour during early voting, planning up to nine rallies across the state to “engage conservative voters, drive early voter turnout and build momentum statewide,” according to Lone Star Liberty PAC, a group backing Paxton and sponsoring the tour.\n\nTexas Rep. James Talarico, who is seeking the Democratic Senate nomination, also launched a “Take Back Texas” tour across the state Tuesday, featuring 12 rallies, in addition to stops at local restaurants and cultural landmarks, ahead of March 3.",

    "fullText": "PARIS (AP) — French authorities said Tuesday they released a tanker intercepted last month in the Mediterranean Sea which is suspected of being part of Russia’s sanctioned shadow fleet shipping oil in violation of international sanctions.\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said in a post on X that the tanker Grinch is to leave French waters after having paid a penalty of “several million euros” and “three weeks of costly immobilization.”\n\n“Circumventing European sanctions comes at a price. Russia will no longer be able to finance its war with impunity through a ghost fleet off our coasts,” Barrot said.\n\nThe French military diverted the ship last month and anchored it in the port of Fos-sur-Mer as part of an investigation into a charge of failure to fly a valid flag. The crew of Indian nationality was being kept on board.\n\n“As part of a guilty plea procedure the company that owns the vessel was sentenced by the Marseille judicial court to a financial penalty of confiscation,” the Marseille prosecutor’s office and regional maritime authorities said in a joint statement.\n\nThe exact amount of the fine was not disclosed.\n\nRussia is believed to be using a fleet of over 400 ships to evade sanctions over its war against Ukraine. France and other countries have vowed to crack down.\n\nThe fleet comprises aging vessels and tankers owned by nontransparent entities with addresses in non-sanctioning countries, and sailing under flags from such countries.\n\nLast September, French naval forces boarded another oil tanker off the French Atlantic coast that President Emmanuel Macron also linked to the shadow fleet. Putin denounced that interception as an act of piracy.\n\nThat tanker’s captain is to go on trial next week over the crew’s alleged refusal to cooperate.",

    "description": "Without a tax on the wealthy or big corporations, NYC Mayor Zohran Mamdani may have to hike property taxes instead.",
    "fullText": "Mayor Zohran Mamdani said a property tax hike is on the table as a \"last resort\" in New York City.\n\nHigher taxes on the wealthy is his preferred way to bridge the $5.4 billion budget deficit — but requires state buy-in.\n\nA potential tax hike could hit middle-class New Yorkers and renters.\n\nNew York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani says that if the state won't play ball on taxing the rich, he'll have to impose a higher tax of his own — and it could hit middle-class New Yorkers.\n\nAt a Tuesday press conference, he laid out two options to address what he said is the city's $5.4 billion budget deficit left by the prior administration.\n\nIn an effort to balance his preliminary $127 billion budget, Mamdani outlined two potential paths forward. The first — and Mamdani's preferred — relies on cooperation from New York Gov. Kathy Hochul: increasing taxes on the wealthy and corporations, a cornerstone of Mamdani's campaign. Hochul has been lukewarm on the idea.\n\nWithout Albany's willingness to hike income or corporate taxes, Mamdani is signaling he will need to turn to other measures to fund his budget. He's floating increasing property taxes for the city's residents — which would hit the middle and working classes as hard as his typical targets on Wall Street — alongside drawing from funds that the city keeps in reserve in case of an economic downturn.\n\nMamdani called that option \"painful,\" and \"a tool of very last resort,\" and said that his administration would continue working with Albany to avoid it.\n\n\"This is a preliminary budget,\" he said at the press conference. \"This is a budget that reflects the only tools that the city has at its disposal.\"\n\nIf Hochul or Albany do not budge, Mamdani said he would increase property taxes by 9.5%.\n\nIn the press conference, Mamdani said the tax would hit middle-class New Yorkers the most. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on which income groups would be most affected or on the proposal's potential impact on middle-income New Yorkers.\n\nMulti-unit buildings — where renters tend to live — are taxed at a higher effective rate than single-family or low-density homes, where more affluent New Yorkers tend to live. While renters don't pay property taxes directly, higher property tax levies on their landlords could, over time, translate into higher rents.\n\n\"New York's property tax system stems from the 1970s, trying to balance the needs of outer borough homeowners with the commercial and multifamily housing in Manhattan,\" Rita Jefferson, a local analyst at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy who focuses on equity, said. \"As a result, property tax rates on single-family homes are much lower than rates on multifamily units, which has led to vastly different bills for properties that have the same market value.\"\n\nNew York City Comptroller Mark Levine, an elected position not appointed by the Mayor, said that Mamdani had proposed a budget that \"honestly and transparently lays out the scale of our challenges,\" and that the city \"undoubtedly\" needs more assistance from Albany.\n\n\"To rely on a property tax increase and a significant draw-down of reserves to close our gap would have dire consequences,\" Levine said in a statement. \"Our property tax system is profoundly unfair and inconsistent, and an across-the-board increase in this tax would be regressive. Drawing down reserves during a period of economic growth would leave us vulnerable to economic turbulence next year.\"\n\nThe proposal was blasted by US Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, a Republican whose district includes Staten Island and parts of Southern Brooklyn.\n\n\"Year after year, City Hall squeezes the middle-class for more by raising the property tax levy, and now Mamdani wants to raise the rate, making the American dream of homeownership less attainable and the cost of housing even more unaffordable for property owners and renters alike,\" Malliotakis said in a statement.\n\nMamdani's proposal doesn't mean that renters or property owners will get hit with a large tax bill immediately; as he stressed in his press conference, the budget is far from final. Hochul reportedly said at an unrelated event that she doesn't think a property tax increase is necessary.\n\n\"This is something that we do not want to do,\" Mamdani said, \"and this is something that we are going to utilize every single option to ensure does not come to pass.\"",

    "description": "Changing your rep range and your workout intensity can help you build more muscle, says an exercise scientist with decades of gym experience.",
    "fullText": "Jim Stoppani has been lifting weights for longer than most fitness influencers have been alive.\n\n\"I'v been training since I was a young kid, probably 7 or 8,\" he told Business Insider. \"My father built an amazing gym in our basement and I wanted to hang out with my dad, so I was down there learning the principles of weightlifting.\"\n\nNow at 58, with a PhD in exercise physiology, his own supplement brand, and a renowned research career, Stoppani has learned from decades of scientific study and first-hand experience what it takes to pack on lean muscle.\n\nHe recommends three strategies everyone should know to make the most of every workout for optimal gains.\n\nOne thing Stoppani has learned over his years in fitness is that progress will plateau — unless you make smart training decisions and plan ahead.\n\nThe human body has natural limits in how much strength or muscle mass we can achieve. As you work out and get stronger, you'll get closer to those limits, but additional gains become increasingly more difficult to earn.\n\nInstead of fighting for diminishing returns, diversify your fitness with different elements like power, agility, mobility, and stamina to get the most bang for your buck in the gym.\n\n\"I'm not going to put on 20 pounds of muscle at my age and with so many years under my training belt,\" Stoppani said. \"So why should I come in here and train like a bodybuilder every day?\"\n\nTo free up time to work on different skills without losing gains, Stoppani often uses a technique called a superset. A superset involves alternating between two exercises that recruit different muscles, with little to no break in between. Doing so allows one muscle group to rest while the other is working, cutting out your downtime in the gym (and potentially burning more fat in the process).\n\nStoppani uses the extra time to work on yoga, stretching, and cardio, to avoid any weak points in his fitness.\n\n\"The thing that I recommend as you get older is to be less singular in your goals and more well-rounded,\" he said.\n\nA concept called \"reps in reserve\" can help make sure you're pushing hard enough to make the most of your workouts, according to Stoppani.\n\nAt the end of each set, think about how many more reps you could do, if you really had to.\n\nToo many reps in reserve, and you're leaving gains on the table. For instance, if you finish a set of 10 reps, and feel like you could easily do 10 more, you should increase your weight or reps until it feels challenging.\n\nHowever, you don't have to push to your absolute limit with every set. Working to total muscle failure, the most you can possibly lift, comes with a risk of injury, and isn't necessary if you aren't a competitive athlete.\n\nFor average gym-goers, the sweet spot for building muscle is one to three reps in reserve, said Stoppani.\n\nHe recommends waiting until the last set to push closer to failure, and ending the set when you're too tired to complete the exercise with proper form.\n\n\"The key to turning on muscle growth is getting closer to muscle failure,\" he said.\n\nForget what you've seen from fitness influencers. There's no magic number when it comes to making your muscles bigger or \"toning\" them.\n\nBuilding muscle is all about challenging your body, whether you're lifting heavy weights for a few reps, or light weights for a lot of reps, according to Stoppani.\n\nBut your choice of weights can lead to slightly different results over time: heavier weights are ideal for getting stronger, while lighter weights help to maximize the signal for muscle tissue to grow.\n\nAs a result, using a variety of strategies can help you make better progress in the long run.\n\n\"The biggest misconception is that you can just use one rep range and stick to that forever,\" Stoppani said. \"You're eventually going to stop getting the same results because you're providing the body the same stress over and over and over again.\"\n\nPrevent your gains from stalling with a periodization plan, breaking up your training into sections of 6 to 12 weeks each. For instance, you might start with sets of six to eight reps, focusing on building strength, and after two months, switch to sets of 10 to 12 reps help boost muscle growth.\n\n\"The best way to build muscle is with change,\" Stoppani said.",

    "fullText": "This interview is based on a conversation with Christina Jones, 40, the CEO of a nonprofit and management consulting firm based in Washington, DC. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy son, Xavier, less than a year old at the time, was fast asleep in his crib while I worked on a policy document as midnight approached.\n\nI was relatively new to my position at a Minnesota-based nonprofit that helps survivors of gender-based violence, and I wanted to demonstrate my value to the organization.\n\nIt was a shared document with other team members, so many could see that the timestamps indicated that I was revising it at 11 p.m.\n\nOne of my colleagues, a mom of teenagers, tried to coach me in a soft, gentle way. \"You don't need to be in here so late,\" she said. \"You need to get some rest.\"\n\nInstead of listening to her, I manipulated the system. I started setting my late-night emails to schedule-send so they arrived at 9 a.m. the next day.\n\nTriple-checking that the Ts were crossed and the Is were dotted was second nature to me. Women, especially Black women, are so often trying to prove ourselves because we want to show we belong.\n\nFor me, it goes back to my parents and community saying that we have to do twice as much to get half of what everyone else has.\n\nIt felt especially true for me in my 20s and early to mid-30s. I was ambitious and forging my legal career, including several years in the office of the attorney general for the District of Columbia.\n\nThe long hours and stress levels were OK for me because I was married without kids. Still, I continued in the same vein after I had Xavier, now 5, because I wanted to create so many things in my life and demonstrate my worthiness.\n\nThen my perspective changed. It took a vehicle collision involving my car and a tractor-trailer to make me reassess the situation.\n\nMy husband, Jason, two girlfriends, and I were driving to a restaurant on January 18, 2025, to celebrate my 39th birthday when it happened.\n\nThankfully, we were traveling at a low speed and emerged relatively unscathed with a few scratches. It was traumatic, but it might have been so much worse.\n\nThe experience scared me into thinking that I could have been taken out. The fact that it was my birthday made it particularly significant — a reminder that I only have one body and time is not infinite.\n\nI'd already been waffling about what to do about my current job for several months. Although it was interesting and challenging, I wondered whether I should start my own consultancy.\n\nFear had put me off. I earned six figures, my company paid 75% of my health insurance, and provided a 3% match to my retirement. The role was fully remote and offered other perks.\n\nI prayed a lot about it, asking God what I should do. It became very clear that I needed to listen, not sit on my dreams, and take this bet on myself.\n\nI needed buy-in from my husband, Jason, because it could have put our household at risk. Still, he and my mom were very supportive. \"What's the worst thing that can happen?\" they said. \"You're an attorney. You can go get another job if it doesn't work out.\"\n\nI'm a firm believer in not burning bridges and leaving a position as graciously as you came in. I resigned in mid-June 2025 and served two months' notice.\n\nMy firm, Command Joy Co., which helps people in the nonprofit field turn passion into sustainable impact, was launched last August.\n\nI'm still learning and growing, but the company is thriving. There is great satisfaction in guiding creatives through the business side of things.\n\nOne of the most challenging aspects of entrepreneurship can be a feeling of isolation. As a result, I go to lunch intentionally three or four times a month with other business owners and spitball ideas.\n\nAs for me-time, I've learned what recharges me, whether it's being near water or relaxing with friends.\n\nMy top priority is always my family. Having Jason and Xavier forces me to unplug in a good way.\n\nI like to think of my life right now as a slow unfold. Just because you were something in one season doesn't mean you have to stay like that in the seasons that follow.",

    "description": "Amazon shutters Blue Jay robot as it transitions to Orbital, a new modular warehouse system enhancing same-day delivery capabilities.",
    "fullText": "Amazon has pulled the plug on one of its newest warehouse robots, a few months after unveiling it.\n\nBlue Jay, a multi-armed robotic system Amazon launched in October for its same-day delivery warehouses, quietly shut down in January, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nMany employees who worked on the project were reassigned to other robotics initiatives, the people added, while asking not to be identified discussing private matters.\n\nThe move shows how hard it is to develop AI robotics technology that's useful and cost-effective. Generative AI has made huge gains in the digital world, thanks to free training data on the web. In the physical realm, useful training data is harder to come by, and the challenges of operating robots in real-world settings are much greater.\n\nTerrence Clark, an Amazon spokesperson, told Business Insider that Blue Jay's core technology will be carried over to other initiatives across the company's network of warehouses. He added that Blue Jay was one of several warehouse robotics bets Amazon has made, alongside efforts such as Vulcan, Sparrow, and Proteus.\n\n\"We're always experimenting with new ways to improve the customer experience and make work safer, more efficient, and more engaging for our employees,\" Clark said in a statement.\n\nBlue Jay was one of Amazon Robotics' biggest announcements last year.\n\nDeveloped in just over a year, far faster than earlier robots like Robin or Sparrow, it leveraged advances in AI to accelerate training and deployment. The machine featured multiple robotic arms capable of reaching and lifting several items at once, a design intended to boost productivity while creating a safer environment for frontline workers.\n\nWhen Amazon unveiled Blue Jay in October, the company said it was being piloted at a fulfillment center in South Carolina and described it as a \"core technology\" for powering same-day delivery while lowering costs.\n\nInternally, though, the project ran into headwinds. People familiar with the effort cited Blue Jay's high cost, manufacturing complexity, and implementation challenges as reasons it was ultimately put on pause.\n\nWhile the Blue Jay system itself is being shelved, Amazon plans to incorporate parts of its technology into future systems, including a new one called \"Flex Cell\" that will be more floor-mounted, the people said. (Blue Jay was mounted to the ceiling).\n\nThe shift is part of a move by Amazon away from an older same-day warehouse system known internally as \"Local Vending Machine,\" or LVM, the people said. LVM facilities were built as largely monolithic systems, with automation tightly integrated into a single, massive structure. Blue Jay was designed to operate within that framework.\n\nNow, Amazon is pivoting to a new same-day warehouse system called \"Orbital.\" Unlike LVM, Orbital is designed to be modular, consisting of many components that can be assembled in different configurations, according to the people who spoke to Business Insider. The more flexible structure is intended to make the system easier to deploy and scale.\n\nOrbital is better suited to smaller same-day delivery warehouses, rather than the sprawling fulfillment centers Amazon has historically operated.\n\nThe system could also potentially be installed as a micro-fulfillment solution in the back of Whole Foods stores, an area Amazon is prioritizing, the people said. Orbital is also expected to handle chilled products, such as groceries. Amazon is revamping its same-day delivery efforts to close the gap with Walmart in groceries and other perishable goods.\n\nAn Orbital rollout remains some time away. The first same-day warehouse built around the Orbital system is not expected to open until 2027, according to people familiar with the project.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "A woman explains why she stopped saving her favorite clothes and items for special occasions and how it helped her enjoy everyday life more.",
    "fullText": "I used to save my favorite clothes for a version of my life that never showed up.\n\nThe blazer stayed in my closet because it felt \"too professional\" for a normal day. The heels were waiting for a dinner I'd yet to be invited to. The earrings were longing for an occasion that felt important enough to justify wearing them. Meanwhile, I wore the same outfits on repeat — to work, to run errands, to all the places where my actual life was happening.\n\nI wasn't saving them for a rainy day. I was saving them for the perfect one. The problem was that \"special occasion\" never came.\n\nThis habit wasn't limited to clothes. I treated everything the same way. A Sephora gift card sat untouched in my drawer, waiting for something \"really worth it.\" I rationed my favorite lip gloss as if it were a limited resource. I refused to light my favorite candle unless the night felt special enough to deserve it. I even held onto the last spritz of my discontinued One Direction perfume for years, as if saving it could somehow make more.\n\nThe special occasion is always vague — an imaginary fancy dinner, a future milestone, a celebration that exists only in theory. So I wait. Years pass. The things I loved enough to save start to feel untouchable. By the time I consider using it, we've waited so long that it feels wrong to start now.\n\nLooking back, it sounds dramatic, but at the time, it felt practical. Why waste something nice on an ordinary day?\n\nThen one day, the thought hit me: why am I living my life like a waiting room?\n\nThat mindset didn't stop at my closet. Saving a jacket for the right moment slowly turned into saving fun for the weekends, saving joy for later, saving happiness for a version of life that felt more legitimate than the one I was already living.\n\nI realized I was treating weekdays like something to get through instead of something to participate in. When I did the math on how many days I was mentally skipping, it felt less like discipline and more like quietly wasting my life away.\n\nThe shift was small at first. I wore blazers to the bars. I strutted in my nice heels to run errands. I put on the earrings just to go to the grocery store. Not for compliments, not for Instagram, not to prove anything to anyone, but because I liked how it made me feel.\n\nThe clothes didn't lose their value because I wore them. They gained it. Each piece started collecting moments and memories instead of dust. Now, when I reach for something I love, it reminds me of a workday that felt a little lighter or a Trader Joe's run where I found my new favorite snack.\n\nThat's the part people tend to dismiss as \"romanticizing your life,\" a phrase that's been flattened into internet fluff. But this wasn't about pretending my errands were glamorous or turning my Mondays into Fridays. It was about presence. About intention. About letting regular days count instead of treating them like placeholders.\n\nIf I'm being honest, it changed more than my outfits. Work felt less like something I had to endure. Errands felt less like chores. I stopped waiting for permission to enjoy my life. I started dressing for myself instead of an imaginary audience or a hypothetical future. I even started liking Mondays.\n\nI realized the dinner counts. The errand counts. The workday counts. And if the opportunity does truly come? I'll wear those pieces again. Clothes are meant to be worn more than once.\n\nThe special occasion didn't disappear. I just stopped waiting for it to arrive.",

    "description": "\"The Late Show\" host Stephen Colbert said CBS blocked an interview over FCC concerns. It highlights tension between broadcasters and their talent.",
    "fullText": "Stephen Colbert said CBS pulled a Democratic lawmaker's interview from \"The Late Show\" over concerns about federal regulations. So, he posted it on YouTube instead.\n\nThe dispute marks the latest flash point in a growing tension between late-night hosts, broadcast networks, and the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nJames Talarico, a Democratic Texas state representative running for a highly competitive US Senate seat, was scheduled to appear on \"The Late Show\" on Monday night.\n\nColbert told viewers during his monologue that network lawyers intervened.\n\n\"He was supposed to be here,\" Colbert said Monday night. \"But we were told in no uncertain terms by our network's lawyers, who called us directly, that we could not have him on the broadcast.\"\n\nColbert said he was also told not to acknowledge the decision on air.\n\n\"Then I was told, in some uncertain terms, that not only could I not have him on, I could not mention me not having him on,\" he said. \"And because my network clearly doesn't want us to talk about this, let's talk about this.\"\n\nCBS said in a statement that it did not prohibit \"The Late Show\" from broadcasting the interview. It said it gave the show legal guidance.\n\nWhile CBS didn't air the interview on TV, the show uploaded it overnight to its YouTube page. By midday Tuesday, the video had racked up more than 2 million views — significantly more than other recent guest interviews, which had largely drawn between about 75,000 and 510,000 views on YouTube.\n\nThe last guest to surpass 1 million views was Bad Bunny, who appeared on \"The Late Show\" ahead of his Super Bowl halftime performance.\n\nColbert said the network's concerns stemmed from the FCC's so-called \"equal time\" rule, which requires broadcast stations to provide equivalent opportunities to legally qualified political candidates.\n\n\"It's the FCC's most time-honored rule, right after 'No nipples at the Super Bowl,'\" Colbert said on Monday night's television-aired monologue.\n\nThe rule applies to over-the-air television and radio broadcasters, but not to cable channels or online platforms — meaning CBS's broadcast would fall under its purview, while YouTube would not.\n\nHe said most late-night talk shows — including his own — typically qualify for what's known as the \"bona fide news exemption.\"\n\nThat carve-out is designed to give news and public affairs programs flexibility to respond to events without having to book opposing candidates for balance.\n\nColbert has hosted several Democratic and independent lawmakers this year, including Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Virginia Gov. Abigail Spanberger, and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\n\nIn recent months, the FCC has stepped up scrutiny of broadcast networks.\n\nOn January 21, the FCC's Media Bureau published a letter that said it had \"not been presented with any evidence\" that any current late-night or daytime talk show qualifies for the \"bona fide news exemption.\"\n\nColbert said that the letter is part of what worried CBS's lawyers.\n\nCBS said in its statement that, \"The show was provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the FCC equal-time rule for two other candidates, including Rep. Jasmine Crockett, and presented options for how the equal time for other candidates could be fulfilled.\" It said the show decided to publish the interview through its YouTube channel instead.\n\nLast week, the FCC opened a probe into Disney-owned ABC after \"The View\" hosted Talarico.\n\nIn the YouTube interview, Talarico said the regulatory scrutiny was politically motivated.\n\n\"I think that Donald Trump is worried that we're about to flip Texas,\" Talarico told Colbert. \"This is the party that ran against cancel culture, and now they're trying to control what we watch, what we say, what we read.\"\n\nTalarico is locked in a competitive Democratic primary for the Senate seat against Rep. Jasmine Crockett. The winner is expected to face a Republican nominee that could include incumbent Sen. John Cornyn, former Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, or Rep. Wesley Hunt.\n\nThe open Senate seat is set to be decided during this year's mid-term elections.\n\nMonday's standoff adds to an already complicated period for Colbert and his network.\n\nIn July, CBS said \"The Late Show\" would be canceled in May 2026, a move that was \"purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night.\"\n\nIt came after Colbert criticized CBS's decision to settle a $16 million class-action lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump over its editing of a \"60 Minutes\" interview with his then-presidential opponent, Kamala Harris.\n\nSome lawmakers raised concerns about CBS's decision, questioning whether it was political.\n\nCBS is owned by Paramount, which was acquired in August by David Ellison's Skydance Media.\n\nThe network has faced other turbulence in recent months. Recently installed CBS News editor in chief Bari Weiss was criticized for her December decision to delay a \"60 Minutes\" segment on the Trump administration's use of jails in El Salvador. And, on Monday night, Anderson Cooper said he would be leaving \"60 Minutes\" after 20 years on the show.\n\nThe FCC and representatives for Colbert did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "Did that computer you were eyeing jump in price? Is that gaming handheld out of stock? You might want to practice a new refrain: Thanks, memory shortage.\n\nAs AI companies demand increasingly large troves of chips to power their large language models, memory chips remain in short supply. That's bad news for much of the consumer electronics market, which relies on DRAM and NAND memory chips.\n\nThe research firm IDC expects \"significant pressure on the memory ecosystem,\" warning that supply growth would be below historical norms this year. Electronics companies from Valve to Framework have already changed their sales procedures because of the shortage. Even Apple, the industry goliath, said it was expecting supply chain pressures on memory that would weigh on its famously high gross margin.\n\nThe memory shortage has existed for months — but it's beginning to affect more shoppers' wallets. And the bad news is it's not expected to let up anytime soon.\n\nElectronics CEOs are sounding the alarm for \"RAMageddon.\"\n\nJust last week, Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing told Reuters that he expected PC unit sales to \"face pressure.\" Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan predicted that there would be \"no relief until 2028.\"\n\nDell has already begun adjusting its device prices, according to an internal list of price changes sent to staff in December seen by Business Insider. The company raised the prices of its Dell Pro and Pro Max notebooks and desktops with 32GB of memory by between $130 and $230, among other increases.\n\nHP also planned price hikes \"across the board\" thanks to the memory shortage, its CEO said on its November earnings call.\n\nSmaller PC makers — which may not enjoy the same amount of supply-chain leverage as their tech titan peers — have also been hit especially hard.\n\nFramework raised its prices in December, then again in January, and again in February. Corsair accidentally underpriced its DRAM kits, canceling preorders and sending out coupons. It then raised prices days later, citing \"market costs.\"\n\nThe gaming device market is also struggling. Valve updated the site for its popular Steam Deck handheld device to say that it may be \"out-of-stock intermittently in some regions due to memory and storage shortages.\" The company also said it must \"revisit\" the pricing and scheduling of its upcoming Xbox and Playstation competitor, the Steam Machine, and VR headset, the Steam Frame, because of the shortage.\n\nBigger players could be next on the horizon: Bloomberg reported over the weekend that Sony was considering pushing back the launch of the next PlayStation, and that Nintendo was considering a price hike for the Switch 2.\n\nSome companies could choose to absorb any associated cost increases at the expense of their margins, opting to wait out the supply crunch.\n\nMeanwhile, bigger and bigger names keep speaking out about the shortage and its impacts.\n\nElon Musk warned of a \"chip wall\" on Tesla's fourth-quarter earnings call. Tim Cook pointed to the shortage on Apple's fourth-quarter earnings call, saying that the company was watching memory prices increase \"significantly.\"\n\nThis is where things get a bit more technical, but it all boils down to basic supply and demand.\n\nThere are three types of chips that are important to know. DRAM (dynamic random access memory) and NAND (non-volatile flash memory) are crucial for building consumer devices. HBM (high-bandwidth memory) chips are used to help train large language models.\n\nThree companies dominate the memory chip market: Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron. These companies also produce HBM chips.\n\nAI companies are hungry for more and more chips, and are willing to break out the checkbook to be first in line for factory production — giving them an edge over many consumer tech companies. They're also flush with cash, with companies like Microsoft and Meta projecting multi-billion-dollar capital expenditures, much of which is going toward AI-related costs like chip acquisition.\n\nThat leaves chipmakers responding to the spike in demand by raising prices, selling supply to AI companies, and some transitioning to HBM production.\n\nThe shortage isn't fading anytime soon. SK Hynix has long secured demand for its entire 2026 DRAM and NAND production volume. The CEO of Micron predicted on its first-quarter earnings call that supply would remain substantially short for the \"foreseeable future.\"\n\nAnd if you're trying to build your own PC, a mere consumer navigating the increasingly volatile memory marketplace: Good luck.",

    "fullText": "A union with 1.8 million members is asking the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate Apollo Global Management's past statements about Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nIn a letter to the SEC's head of enforcement on Tuesday, the American Federation of Teachers accused the asset manager of making \"misleading\" claims about its exposure to the convicted sex offender.\n\nThe letter says that Apollo previously suggested that its Epstein risk was largely limited to cofounder Leon Black, who stepped down as CEO in 2021 — after a law firm hired by Apollo found that Black paid Epstein millions over the years for financial advice.\n\nThe letter went on to say that the Justice Department's latest release of Epstein files suggests the firm provided an \"inaccurate and incomplete picture of the firm and its partners' connections to Epstein.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Apollo CEO Marc Rowan stood by the firm's 2021 disclosure to investors, saying that no one other than Black \"had either a business or personal relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.\"\n\n\"There is nothing new here,\" the statement said. \"While Mr. Epstein sought to do work with the Apollo cofounders other than Mr. Black, it was declined at every turn.\"\n\nThe AFT, whose members have billions in pension money invested with Apollo, cited communications between cofounders Rowan and a third cofounder, Josh Harris, released by the DOJ on January 30. It noted communications between Rowan and Epstein spanned from 2013 to 2016, including a 2016 email showing Rowan and Epstein discussing \"Apollo calculations for a tax receivable agreement.\"\n\n\"As the Epstein files make clear, Apollo partners Rowan and Harris appear to have consulted with Epstein on numerous personal and professional matters,\" the letter said.\n\n\"Clearly, there is material risk in this association with Apollo's business, and its investors deserve to be accurately informed about that matter,\" said the letter to the SEC's Margaret Ryan.",

    "title": "Mamdani says if the state won't tax the wealthiest New Yorkers, he'd have to tax the middle class as a 'last resort'",
    "description": "Without a tax on the wealthy or big corporations, NYC Mayor Zohran Mamdani may have to hike property taxes instead.",
    "fullText": "New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani says that if the state won't play ball on taxing the rich, he'll have to impose a higher tax of his own — and it could hit middle-class New Yorkers.\n\nAt a Tuesday press conference, he laid out two options to address what he said is the city's $5.4 billion budget deficit left by the prior administration.\n\nIn an effort to balance his preliminary $127 billion budget, Mamdani outlined two potential paths forward. The first — and Mamdani's preferred — relies on cooperation from New York Gov. Kathy Hochul: increasing taxes on the wealthy and corporations, a cornerstone of Mamdani's campaign. Hochul has been lukewarm on the idea.\n\nWithout Albany's willingness to hike income or corporate taxes, Mamdani is signaling he will need to turn to other measures to fund his budget. He's floating increasing property taxes for the city's residents — which would hit the middle and working classes as hard as his typical targets on Wall Street — alongside drawing from funds that the city keeps in reserve in case of an economic downturn.\n\nMamdani called that option \"painful,\" and \"a tool of very last resort,\" and said that his administration would continue working with Albany to avoid it.\n\n\"This is a preliminary budget,\" he said at the press conference. \"This is a budget that reflects the only tools that the city has at its disposal.\"\n\nIf Hochul or Albany do not budge, Mamdani said he would increase property taxes by 9.5%.\n\nIn the press conference, Mamdani said the tax would hit middle-class New Yorkers the most. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on which income groups would be most affected or on the proposal's potential impact on middle-income New Yorkers.\n\nMulti-unit buildings — where renters tend to live — are taxed at a higher effective rate than single-family or low-density homes, where more affluent New Yorkers tend to live. While renters don't pay property taxes directly, higher property tax levies on their landlords could, over time, translate into higher rents.\n\n\"New York's property tax system stems from the 1970s, trying to balance the needs of outer borough homeowners with the commercial and multifamily housing in Manhattan,\" Rita Jefferson, a local analyst at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy who focuses on equity, said. \"As a result, property tax rates on single-family homes are much lower than rates on multifamily units, which has led to vastly different bills for properties that have the same market value.\"\n\nNew York City Comptroller Mark Levine, an elected position not appointed by the Mayor, said that Mamdani had proposed a budget that \"honestly and transparently lays out the scale of our challenges,\" and that the city \"undoubtedly\" needs more assistance from Albany.\n\n\"To rely on a property tax increase and a significant draw-down of reserves to close our gap would have dire consequences,\" Levine said in a statement. \"Our property tax system is profoundly unfair and inconsistent, and an across-the-board increase in this tax would be regressive. Drawing down reserves during a period of economic growth would leave us vulnerable to economic turbulence next year.\"\n\nThe proposal was blasted by US Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, a Republican whose district includes Staten Island and parts of Southern Brooklyn.\n\n\"Year after year, City Hall squeezes the middle-class for more by raising the property tax levy, and now Mamdani wants to raise the rate, making the American dream of homeownership less attainable and the cost of housing even more unaffordable for property owners and renters alike,\" Malliotakis said in a statement.\n\nMamdani's proposal doesn't mean that renters or property owners will get hit with a large tax bill immediately; as he stressed in his press conference, the budget is far from final. Hochul reportedly said at an unrelated event that she doesn't think a property tax increase is necessary.\n\n\"This is something that we do not want to do,\" Mamdani said, \"and this is something that we are going to utilize every single option to ensure does not come to pass.\"",

    "description": "I visited a huge toy fair in NYC to find the next hot new trend. Labubus are over. Next up for kids and the young at heart? The highland cow.",
    "fullText": "I'm calling it: If you haven't already, you're going to start seeing highland cows in toy aisles around the country.\n\nAfter visiting one of the industry's largest fairs earlier this week, I think I'm qualified to say: The shaggy cow is taking over as the hot new animal for plush toys.\n\nIf you've been paying attention to toys — or if you have kids — you probably already know capybaras are big, but they've been the hot thing for more than a year now. Same with axolotls, the eerily cute pink salamanders. Those trends are peaking, though.\n\nStuffed animals seem to go in trend cycles. In the mid-2010s, llamas and owls were all over baby and kids' clothes and toys. Before that, hedgehogs and foxes.\n\nNot everyone I talked to at the Toy Fair, the toy industry convention held in New York over Presidents Day weekend, agreed with my assessment. I got a few other surprising predictions:\n\nBut enough people I asked said the same thing — that the trending animal is the highland cow, with its caramel fur and tawny mop of hair — that I feel I can say there's a modest consensus.\n\nLike I said, not everyone agreed on the cow. But there was agreement, among everyone I talked to, about three things casting a long shadow over the toy business: tariffs, TikTok, and Labubus.\n\nI chatted with several small to midsize toy companies who said that the tariffs that began when President Donald Trump declared \"Liberation Day\" have hurt their businesses. One plush toy maker said they're paying $10,000 extra per container in tariff charges for their high-end plush animals made in the Philippines. They haven't raised prices yet, and the new fees just eat into their profit. Another plush maker said that they raised prices once after tariffs, but are trying to avoid another hike.\n\nToy makers' ears must've been burning when Trump made comments about how perhaps kids could learn to live with just a few dolls instead of many. But Trump was right about something — kids do often have more toys now than they did 30 years ago because toys are, in fact, cheaper than ever.\n\nThe rate of inflation for toys is well below the national average for all things, meaning a Barbie or Hot Wheel costs relatively less today than it did back in 1995. (If you're a parent looking at a mess of toys spilling out of boxes and shelves, you're not alone.) Part of the reason toys have gotten cheaper is overseas manufacturing, which the tariffs are now hitting.\n\nThe big toy brands like Barbie, Lego, and Pokémon all had new items to debut at the fair. Among the smaller toy brands, a few trends emerged — blind boxes were huge, and many brands and distributors had cute figurines packaged in blind boxes or adopted the aesthetic of twee characters sold alongside Labubus at the Hong Kong-based retailer Pop Mart.\n\nStill, no one seemed to think there was a clear heir apparent to Labubus, which were a singular meteoric event in the toy world (yes, there have been viral toys before, like Beanie Babies or Tickle-Me-Elmos, but the rapid internet and celebrity-fueled Labubu phenomenon feels unique).\n\n\"Labubu is such a great example of something from nothing, but really built on the foundation of everything. Blind boxes have been massive. Plush has been massive. It was the amalgamation of a ton of the listening, and it then getting discovered,\" said Eric Morse, VP of new business initiatives at Spirit Halloween said during a panel talk about Gen Alpha trends.\n\nMorse went on to explain they used a similar strategy for rushing out \"K-Pop Demon Hunters\" costumes this October after the surprise hit debuted on Netflix over the summer. (Of course, even though they pushed through a licensed costume at a far faster speed than normal, they still sold out well before Halloween, much to the ire of 8-year-olds everywhere.) \"How we view the business is listen first, execute second,\" Morse said.\n\nWhen toy and candy trends happen rapidly on TikTok, it can be hard to predict surges in demand. And with on-again, off-again tariffs, it's even harder to plan, lots of industry insiders told me. That's something I kept hearing from all the vendors I talked with: uncertainty.\n\nBut one thing I feel confident about is highland cows. You heard it here first, folks.",

    "fullText": "The rivalry between xAI and OpenAI is heating up again — this time, over wood-fired pizza.\n\nOver the weekend, Elon Musk and an OpenAI engineer jockeyed on X about wood-fired crusts, dough fermentation, and campus chefs.\n\nOn its face, it was a lighthearted back-and-forth about free pizza for lunch. Underneath, it encapsulates a trend playing out in Silicon Valley: rival AI companies are publicly pitching culture — and perks like free lunch — in the talent war for top engineers.\n\nThe exchange began when Musk reposted a video of an xAI engineer calling his job the \"opportunity of a lifetime.\"\n\nJoin @xAI https://t.co/Fo3kjhaTXA\n\nThe post quickly drew a response from xAI's competitor, OpenAI.\n\n\"Or join Codex,\" said Thibault Sottiaux, an engineering lead working on OpenAI's Codex software agent, who is also hiring. OpenAI operates \"with much of the same principles,\" he wrote — before adding an increasingly common recruitment pitch.\n\n\"Join the bright side, we have pizza,\" Sottiaux wrote.\n\nJoin the bright side, we have pizza\n\nMusk fired back: \"But how good is your wood oven pizza?\"\n\nThe pizza posturing then shifted to ingredients — and the corporate chefs preparing them.\n\n\"But how about the dough?\" he wrote back. \"Can't take shortcuts, needs 24 hours at least. And our chef is 🔥.\"\n\nOur chef is so good that God looked down at the food from heaven and said you my most delicious creation 👼\n\n\"Our chef is so good that God looked down at the food from heaven and said you my most delicious creation,\" Musk replied.\n\n\"And after having a bite, he wasn't 100% satisfied and asked our chef to improve upon the SoTA,\" Sottiaux said. \"Our chef delivered, and created a recipe now universally credited to accelerating the AGI timeline.\"\n\nThe tomato pie-based banter was sweet — but the subtext was spicier.\n\nAI labs are locked in a high-stakes dash for elite engineers, with high-end compensation packages stretching into the nine-figure territory.\n\nCompanies including Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, OpenAI, and Musk's xAI are competing for a relatively small pool of researchers capable of building the next generation of models and infrastructure.\n\nAside from money, two key perks have emerged in the AI talent wars, according to professional AI poacher Mark Zuckerberg: access to GPUs and fewer direct reports.\n\n\"People say, 'I want the fewest number of people reporting to me and the most GPUs,'\" Zuckerberg said in 2025 TITV interview.\n\nAt the same time, the broader tech industry has pulled back on many of the pre-pandemic perks amid cost-cutting. Remote work has narrowed, layoffs have gathered steam, and perks like pet care stipends and expansive wellness benefits are becoming less common for new hires.\n\nBut there's one perk that has remained: the fancy lunch spread.\n\nMight as well throw in wood-fired pizza, too.",

Markdown is a simple way to add formatting, including links, to plaintext documents—and links were the source of the vulnerability.\n\n\"An attacker could trick a user into clicking a malicious link inside a Markdown file opened in Notepad, causing the application to launch unverified protocols that load and execute remote files,\" according to the security response notice.\n\nMarkdown has long been popular in certain parts of the internet—anyone who occasionally comments on Reddit or chats using Discord is likely at least a little familiar with it. But the markup language has become even more important in the age of AI—most documents are converted to plain text Markdown files to train models.\n\nMarkdown support was added around the same time Copilot was integrated into Notepad, as part of a broader push to add AI to every corner of the operating system. And there's an argument to be made that all these AI additions are adding up to new vulnerabilities. Microsoft patched 1,129 bugs in 2025 according to Krebs on Security, a prominent cybersecurity blog. That's an 11.9% increase over the previous year, which was already unusually high. Microsoft itself admits that AI agents will open up new vulnerabilities, even as the company adds them to Windows.\n\nThis is all to say that installing security updates is likely more important now than ever. Sure, you could disable all AI features in Windows, but that's unlikely to protect you from all the new vulnerabilities—installing Linux might, though.\n\nLuckily for Windows users, this vulnerability was fixed in Microsoft's February 2026 security update. To find out if you've installed it, open the Settings app, head to \"Windows Update,\" then check if an update labeled \"2026-02 Security Update\" is waiting to be installed. If so, click the \"Restart Now\" button to install the update.",

    "title": "Here Are the New Features Coming in iOS 26.4",
    "description": "Let AI create Apple Music playlists for you.",
    "fullText": "iOS 26.3 was a decidedly small update. It introduced a new tool to transfer data to Android, and gave some iPhones the ability to hide precise location data from cellular networks. But beyond some other small changes and security patches, that's all there was to write home about. iOS 26.4 is a different story. The update, which is currently in beta testing, adds a number of interesting new features to compatible iPhones, especially if you're an Apple Music user.\n\nAs with all beta software, iOS 26.4 is currently in testing, which means these features are subject to change at any time. It's possible some won't make it to the official release of iOS 26.4, while others could look different than they do now. While you can install the iOS 26.4 beta at any time by enrolling your device in the beta program, do so at your own discretion. I'd recommend using a secondary device to test this software if you can, but either way, make sure the device in question is fully backed up to a computer before installing the beta.\n\nThe latest trend in streaming services seems to be AI-generated playlists. YouTube Music recently rolled out the option, while Spotify offers a couple different takes on the feature. The idea is to tell the AI what type of music you want to listen to, whether that be a specific artist or genre, or just a concept or mood (e.g., \"Make me a playlist for drinking coffee on a lazy Sunday morning\").\n\nNow Apple Music is the latest service to introduce such a feature. The first iOS 26.4 beta comes with \"Playlist Playground,\" which works about how you'd expect. You tell Apple Music's AI what you want to hear, and it generates a playlist with 25 different songs. You can adjust the playlist if you don't like the result, as well as edit the title, cover image, and description.\n\nIn addition to Playlist Playground, Apple Music's UI is also changing in iOS 26.4. You'll see new full-page artwork when listening to music, as well as redesigned albums and playlists that adjust their colors based on the artwork. Plus, there's now a \"Concerts Near You\" feature that helps you find shows in your area, based on the music you like to listen to.\n\nRCS support is the best thing to happen to the iPhone in a long time. It makes texting Android users about the same as texting iPhone users, which has not been the case for most of iMessage's history. But while most of the standard perks rolled in with the update, including functioning group chats and high-quality image sharing, one key feature did not: end-to-end encryption (E2EE).\n\nWithout (E2EE), your messages can be intercepted and read by those with the skills to do so. With E2EE, they cannot. It's a major security feature that's key to both iMessage and RCS, and one of the reasons you shouldn't send messages over SMS, as it doesn't support E2EE. Not all Android setups support E2EE over RCS, but it's still a bummer that the iPhone's Messages app doesn't either.\n\nThat's now changing. With the first iOS 26.4 beta, Apple is now testing E2EE for RCS. You'll find the option in Settings, though Apple notes that not all devices or carriers support it. Someday soon, however, iPhone users texting Android users over RCS will be able to enjoy the added security benefits of E2EE.\n\nWith iOS 26.4, Apple changed the Wallpapers settings menu. Before, you could select from pre-downloaded wallpaper packs on your iPhone; now, you can choose which packs you want to download instead. It's a small change, but an interesting one at that. It seems Apple doesn't want to assume you're interested in all of its wallpaper options anymore, and instead would rather pick and choose the ones you want to try. Apple also made similar changes to picking watch faces in the Apple Watch app.\n\nIf you ever label reminders as \"urgent\" on your iPhone, you'll find them in a new location. Now, when you open Reminders, you'l find an Urgent section, alongside other options like Today, All, and Scheduled.\n\nWhile this isn't an iOS feature, it is a key new change in the first macOS 26.4 beta. Apple is now testing a \"charge limit\" feature on Mac, similar to the charge limit feature that already exists on iOS; when your device is plugged in for a long period of time, it will limit how much the battery can charge to. You can set the cap as low as 80%, or as high as 100%. The idea is, by limiting the charge level, you reduce how often the battery completes a full charge cycle, which can prolong its lifespan and delay aging. The \"younger\" your battery is, the longer it'll last between charges, so enthusiasts like to use these features to maximize how much battery life they can get out of their devices.",

    "description": "This is the first zero-day in Google Chrome this year.",
    "fullText": "If you use Google Chrome, you should install the latest update ASAP. Google has issued a patch for a high-severity flaw that has been actively exploited in the wild—the first Chrome zero-day in 2026.\n\nThe latest flaw, catalogued as CVE-2026-2441, is a use-after-free vulnerability in CSSFontFeatureValuesMap, Chrome's CSS font feature implementation. A use-after-free vulnerability is a flaw in which an application attempts to use memory after it has been released back to the system. This type of bug allows attackers to execute code, escalate privileges, cause app or system crashes, and leak sensitive data.\n\nCVE-2026-2441 would allow \"a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code inside a sandbox via a crafted HTML page.\" Essentially, this means malicious HTML content could run code inside a Chrome tab, extension, or plugin. As Malwarebytes explains, this is dangerous because attackers can see or modify whatever the isolated browser tab (sandbox) can access, allowing actions like credential harvesting and traffic rerouting—even if it cannot escape to impact the whole operating system.\n\nGoogle said that this vulnerability has been exploited in the wild but hasn't provided any specific details as to how. The discovery has been attributed to Shaheen Fazim.\n\nGoogle released a Stable channel update on Feb. 13 with a patch for this flaw. The latest versions of Chrome are 145.0.7632.75/76 for Windows and macOS and 144.0.7559.75 for Linux, so you'll want to ensure you are up to date. Go to the Chrome menu and select About Google Chrome to check which version you're on.\n\nChrome updates automatically when you close and reopen the browser, but if you don't do that regularly, keep an eye out for pending updates in the top-right corner of your browser window. Apply these updates immediately by tapping the three dots and selecting the first menu item. Chrome will need to restart to complete the update.",

    "title": "When to Choose Resistance Bands vs. Dumbbells",
    "description": "One is more portable, the other more versatile. Here's how to choose.",
    "fullText": "Resistance bands and dumbbells are both great for strength training at home, since they don’t require much storage space and tend to be a lot cheaper than a full setup with a barbell and plates. But they each have pros and cons, so let’s talk about how to choose.\n\nIf you buy beefy enough resistance bands, they offer a lot of resistance. A pair of “strong” bands from EliteFTS will pull on a barbell with the same force as 122 to 275 pounds of weights, depending on how far you stretch them. During the time gyms were closed because of COVID, coach Greg Nuckols told us that a set of bands would be his pick for training as heavy as possible without traditional gym equipment.\n\nIf you truly love resistance bands, you can probably figure out how to do almost anything with them. But for most of us, dumbbells are a little more intuitive and it’s easier to find exercises that work appropriate muscles.\n\nIf you use a resistance band, for many exercises you’ll need to find a place to anchor it. Sometimes you step on the band, so it’s pulling on your feet (not always comfortable if you work out barefoot). Other times you’ll need an appropriate anchor at floor level, or overhead, or straight in front of you. Depending on where you work out, there may not be anything strong enough to do the job with the right placement.\n\nThis means it's easier to put together a routine with dumbbells: you just pick them up. Plenty of staple gym exercises use dumbbells, and you probably already know some: bicep curls, shoulder presses, bench presses, lunges, and so on. Just hold the weights and do the exercise, no planning needed.\n\nIron is forever, but rubber degrades over time. Check the manufacturer’s directions, but most will tell you to replace your bands after a year, or for thinner bands, sometimes just a few months.\n\nThe way you use the bands can affect their lifespan. If the band rubs against its anchor point, for example, that can wear it out more quickly. (Follow manufacturers’ instructions for properly anchoring the band or attaching it to accessories.) When a band snaps, it may end up hitting you, which is why some trainers advise against moves like face pulls in which you’re pulling a band toward yourself.\n\nThis, I think, is the most important difference between bands and dumbbells. When you pick up something from the floor, you have to support its entire weight as soon as it leaves the ground. But if you’re getting the resistance from a band, the resistance will feel very light when you’re closer to the floor, and get progressively harder as you stand up with it.\n\nThis means you may be working harder than you want at the top of the lift, but not being challenged at all at the bottom. You can still work all your muscles if you choose and combine exercises appropriately, but you have to carefully choose exercises to make sure you're working every part of the range of movement. This factor means that bands aren’t a drop-in replacement for dumbbell or barbell work.\n\nPeople often start with a pair of dumbbells that come stamped with a number on one end (a five-pound pair, for example), but if you actually train with dumbbells consistently, pretty soon you’ll need more. You’ll also notice that different exercises require different weights: Something that’s challenging to curl will probably still be too light to press overhead.\n\nA way around this is to buy adjustable dumbbells. You slide plates on and off, or with the fancy (expensive) brands you place them back on their rack and select the next weight. I have some picks for good adjustable dumbbells here.\n\nYou can still outgrow adjustable dumbbells. The affordable ones that come in 40-pound sets might seem huge to you at first, but 20 pounds per hand is not that much if you’re strong. “I can always buy more of the little plates,” you’ll say to yourself, forgetting to check how much room the dumbbell handle has for little plates. Often, not much.\n\nThe bottom line is that dumbbells and resistance bands each have their pros and cons. It’s cheaper to buy several sizes of resistance bands than to buy a full lineup of dumbbells, but the bands won’t necessarily give you the same workout. This is another case where the ideal answer is probably: Why not both?",

    "description": "On the GAA Social podcast, John McAreavey opens up about loss, moving forward and justice for Michaela, who was killed on their honeymoon in Mauritius.",
    "fullText": "It has been 15 years since Michaela McAreavey was murdered on her honeymoon in Mauritius.\n\nIn January 2011, the 27-year-old teacher was found strangled in a bath at a hotel 12 days after her wedding to John McAreavey and, to this day, no-one has been convicted of her killing.\n\nTwo hotel workers were tried for her murder, but found not guilty in 2012.\n\nThe daughter of Mickey Harte, the legendary Tyrone All-Ireland winning manager in gaelic football, Michaela's death resonated through the island of Ireland and beyond.\n\nSpeaking on the GAA Social podcast, John opens about moving past the heartbreak and pain, but there is also a story of hope and living life with gratitude.\n\n\"I haven't been able to say it for a large chunk of my life, but I am happy and I've a lot to be happy and grateful for, and I thank God for it,\" he said.\n\nJohn McAreavey. Moving forward after Michaela. Living life as best you can.\n\nAfter meeting as students in Belfast, Michaela and John married in on 30 December 2010.\n\nHowever, tragedy would strike just 12 days later when she visited the couple's room in a luxury resort in Mauritius on her own after lunch, and she was discovered by John who raised the alarm.\n\nIn the aftermath, John, now 41, said there was shock, but there was also \"anger\" at how the authorities dealt with her death, and the lack of convictions that followed.\n\n\"I've never asked the question of, 'why did this happen to me?', I've always just felt so sorry for Michaela,\" he said.\n\n\"It's only now that I'm able to talk about it quite logically. There's still a hell of a lot of pain associated with it, but I accept that it's always going to be the case.\n\n\"I know how intense it is to live with that pain, so I've been able to find a way to manage it.\"\n\nMcAreavey, who featured for Down's senior football panel and won an All-Ireland Intermediate title with his club Tullylish in 2010, admits that \"moving on is a term that has never been comfortable for me\".\n\n\"I've said before about moving forward, and that just changes the reference around it.\n\n\"You'll never move on from something like that, you can't just let that be. You have to find a way to move forward.\n\n\"I'm still heavily involved for trying to find justice for Michaela so it's still a very active part of my life.\"\n\nFaith has played a big role in processing what had happened, and he says his relationship with God has helped him realise that \"every day is a gift\".\n\n\"Right from the moment it happened I felt that warmth and protection, and I've never felt alone too much in that way.\n\n\"A lot of that was down to Michaela, too, with the amount of faith she had in God.\n\n\"I'm someone who lives with gratitude. I can't look at it any other way because I still have so many things that are good in my life.\n\n\"Yes, I had this awful, traumatic experience. But I got to have Michaela and I got to experience her, even for a short time.\"\n\nMcAreavey says he has battled with the guilt of Michaela's death and says \"that part has always been a struggle\".\n\n\"I always believe when you are with somebody, you are there to protect them.\n\n\"You do and you have to [be pragmatic that he could not have stopped her death], it's the only way to take yourself out of it. It's something that I've had to live with and navigate through.\"\n\nWhile the search for justice in Mauritius carries on, Michaela's legacy continued in Ireland. A foundation was set up in her name, and a crowd of 20,000 attended Casement Park in Belfast for the tribute Match for Michaela, which saw All-Ireland champions Donegal play an Ulster select side.\n\nBut it was after that match, when McAreavey, who says people talking about him \"doesn't bother me\", had organised to go to Galway with his friends, that he met Tara.\n\n\"It wasn't an overly conscious decision that I was going to go and meet somebody.\n\n\"It was an emotional time, and I remember waking up on the Monday after the match for Michaela and I felt a lot lighter, something had definitely changed.\n\n\"There was lanterns at the event and it must have been during the week when I was watching it back, they went into the sky and formed the shape of a 'M'.\n\n\"I read that as Michaela saying, 'John I'm fine here and off you go, move on forward'. That was a big thing.\"\n\n\"I went to Galway and bumped into Tara, and conversation struck and off it went.\"\n\nWith the blessing of the Harte family, who McAreavey says \"are great people\", Tara and John married in 2016. They now have two children, a son and a daughter.\n\nHe adds there is now a \"bond\" with the Harte family, particularly who Mickey and Mark, Michaela's brother, who became \"really good friends\".\n\n\"When you love someone you want the best for them, and I truly believe they were happy for me. They seen the pain I was in, and it represented coming out of that pain.\n\n\"There were tears, but it was all from the right place. It's tricky to navigate, but they've all been very supportive.\"\n\nMcAreavey said Tara is \"unbelievable\" and her support has \"been paramount\" as he balances moving forward with his life while fighting his battle for Michaela.\n\n\"The time I met Tara I was still grieving, and then you are dealing with these new feelings.\n\n\"She's been thrown into this limelight. There was always so much love there, even in the times where it felt like it was too difficult, it's always come back to that.\"\n\nMcAreavey said he feels \"a sense of responsibility\" to continue to fight for Michaela 15 years on.\n\nWhile he has moved forward with other aspects of his life, he said \"there's a fight in me that I don't think that will ever go away\".\n\n\"The least you would expect it the people who are responsible would have to pay for that.\n\n\"It does seem impossible at times, but then I see other people around the world in cases that have went on for 20 or 30 years and that gives me hope.\n\n\"I truly believe if the right people have the will then they can make things happen.\"\n\nIn November, Irish Tanaiste Simon Harris said he there would be \"immediate\" engagement\" with the authorities in Mauritius having met with the McAreavey and Harte families, and John says \"I can only control what I control\".\n\n\"We've been working with the department of foreign affairs in Ireland for quite some time to engage through the diplomatic routes.\n\n\"That's where it has to be, but it's imploring them to do what they have to do. That is ongoing. It's essentially asking people to do their job.\"\n\nMcAreavey hopes there is still a possibility where the two hotel workers who were acquitted in 2012, Sandip Moneea and Avinash Treebhoowoon, could be recharged in the future.\n\nTreebhoowoon had initially confessed to the murder but plead not guilty after saying police had beaten a confession out of him.\n\nThe initial trial raised issues about the crime scene contamination which led to a lack to DNA evidence and a former suspect and key witness, Raj Theekoy, has since died, but McAreavey has not given up hope.\n\n\"There's no guarantees you would get the verdict. What we experienced was a circus, but right now that would be enough victory, to see those guys go through the mill again.\n\n\"If I focus too much on the outcome then it won't serve me well. All I can focus on is the pursuit of that justice.\"\n\nMcAreavey feels that \"how it concludes is ultimately down to me\", and his own determination for justice will keep Michaela's case in light.\n\n\"The moment I stop pursuing things, then people over there will respond in kind.\n\n\"The longer it goes on it does get challenging to see, 'where is this going?. But I feel with the right people engaged it can happen.\"",

    "fullText": "Trinidad and Tobago's bobsleigh team said it is \"mission accomplished\" in their 'operation don't come last' as they finished 25th out of 26 in the Olympic two-man event in Cortina.\n\nHarrogate-born Axel Brown said in January that the goal was to not finish bottom of the standings at the Games and they were second-from-bottom, ahead of Israel, with an overall time of 2:51:05.\n\nThe 33-year-old, who raced for Team GB for seven years before switching to compete for his mother's home nation, pilots the sled with brakeman De Aundre John.\n\n\"It's absolutely mission accomplished. Me and Dre [John] have been able to do something special together,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\n\"For little Trinidad and Tobago to do that with no state funding is huge. To beat another nation at the top of their game as well that feels like a win - it is a win.\"\n\nFinishing outside the top 20, despite producing their quickest run in heat three, means they did not progress to the final heat but Brown and John will also compete in the four-man event later this week.\n\nIt was a German clean sweep on the two-man podium as Johannes Lochner and Georg Fleischhauer won gold while legendary pilot Francesco Friedrich and Alexander Schuller took silver with Adam Ammour and Alexander Schaller claiming bronze.\n\nBrown said the team \"won the gold medal\" when they qualified for the Games and he is representing Trinidad and Tobago at his second Olympics having also competed at Beijing 2022.\n\nBrown, a former American Football player and taekwondo medallist at national level, took up bobsleigh aged 21 and changed allegiance from GB with the aim of reviving the bobsleigh programme in Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nThe Caribbean nation had qualified for three consecutive Winter Games from 1994 to 2002 but Brown guiding them to the Games in China four years ago was their first appearance in 20 years.\n\nThey ultimately finished 28th out of 30 in the two-man event, above Jamaica and Brazil.\n\nQualification for the Games in Italy was even more demanding as they had to qualify for both the two and four-man events, which they managed for the first time.\n\n\"It was very special to stand at the top of the track with Dre,\" said Brown.\n\n\"I had my dad on the start line with me and my coach Lee Johnston, who has been the cornerstone of this team and helped us make a team out of a bunch of misfits.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

It just wasn't to be - we started a bit slower than we wanted.\n\n\"Our group gained great experience from the tournament, for many it was their first World Cup. It's really competitive and shows the pressure elite cricketers are under.\n\n\"Those big moments, it's how you deal with them and process them. We hope to have big moments in the next couple of years and prepare well for the next tournament.\"\n\nZimbabwe will take on Sri Lanka in Colombo on Thursday (09:30 GMT) with the winner topping Group B, but they are both guaranteed a place in the next phase of the tournament.",

    "fullText": "US politicians flooded the summit—but Europe no longer sees the United States as a reliable partner.\n\nMunich—There was one question the kept floating around the Munich Security Conference (MSC) this year. “Will this be the last one?”\n\nThe future of “Davos with guns” has never been \n\nThis did not stop US lawmakers from making an appearance, especially Democrats, including several 2028 presidential contenders, who were eager to signal an alternative foreign policy to the one promoted by Trump. At one point, a panel attendee quipped, “It seems that Munich is the new Iowa.”\n\nAmong the Americans present were California Governor Gavin Newsom, who headlined several panels on climate change and security, Senator Mark Kelly (D-AZ), Senator Ruben Gallego (D-AZ), Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, and perhaps most notably, New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nIn her first major trip abroad, AOC stepped onto the world stage. But for a politician that has built a progressive platform on criticism of US military interventionism and domestic policies aimed at benefitting the working class, her presence at MSC, widely considered to be the biggest international annual security event in the West and a major hub for hawkish military elites, seemed at first glance out of line with her values.\n\n“I think the congresswoman shares a lot of that skepticism of traditional security institutions,” said Matt Duss, former foreign policy adviser to Bernie Sanders and an informal adviser to AOC on this trip to Germany. “But she clearly thought that there was value in coming to engage this conference, to listen, and to share a perspective that is very rarely heard at this kind of gathering.”\n\nShe and other Democrats were eager to call out Trump’s destruction of the transatlantic alliance.\n\n“They are looking to withdraw the United States from the entire world so that we can turn into an age of authoritarians that can carve out a world where Donald Trump can command the Western Hemisphere and Latin America as his personal sandbox, where Putin can saber-rattle around Europe,” she said on a panel, urging the United States to instead recommit to global humanitarian projects like the United States Agency for International Development, which Trump dismantled early upon retaking office in 2025.\n\nBut few Europeans seemed convinced that the transatlantic partnership could be fully mended.\n\n“And we, Europe,” German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said in a speech, “have ended a long break from world history,” before continuing to explain that the world order is now “openly characterized” by great-power politics.\n\nHe stopped short of writing off the United States as a partner, saying, “I understand the unease and doubt that surface in such demands. I even share some of them. And yet, these demands are not well thought-out. They simply ignore harsh geopolitical realities in Europe, and they underestimate the potential that our partnership with the United States still holds, despite all the difficulties.”\n\n“A sovereign Europe is our best answer to the new era,” he added. “Uniting and strengthening Europe is our most important task today.”\n\nThis message of Europe strengthening its military is part of a longer vision of a world order without the United States as a reliable partner. For decades, European leaders invoked “strategic autonomy” as a kind of aspirational slogan—something to be developed slowly, cautiously, without antagonizing Washington. Now it is urgent operational doctrine.\n\nPrivately, US and European officials spoke less diplomatically. One senior Democratic staff member described what was happening between the United States and Europe as a long divorce, where Vance’s message last year was one partner storming out of the room, while Rubio’s return this year was a more measured message in front of the divorce court.\n\nThis was perhaps the central paradox of the conference. Even as Democrats arrived to reassure allies that another United States still existed—one committed to alliances, multilateralism, and the liberal international order—their very presence underscored the fragility of that promise. European officials could listen politely, but they could not ignore the structural reality: US foreign policy now appeared contingent on domestic electoral outcomes in a way that made long-term planning difficult.\n\nFor AOC, this was precisely the argument for engagement. In panel discussions and smaller side events, she emphasized that US politics was not monolithic and that transatlantic relationships extended beyond any one administration. Her argument rested on the idea that alliances were not simply agreements between governments but relationships between societies.\n\n“This is a moment where we are seeing our presidential administration tear apart the transatlantic partnership,” she said. “I think one of the reasons why not just myself but many Democrats are here is because we want to tell a larger story, that what is happening is indeed very grave. And we are in a new era, domestically and globally. There are many leaders that have said, ‘We will go back,’ and I think we need to recognize that we are in a new day and a new time.”\n\n“But that does not mean that the majority of Americans are ready to walk away from a rules-based order and that we are ready to walk away from our commitment to democracy,” she said, adding, “Many of us are here to say, ‘We are ready for the next chapter,’ not to have the world turn to isolation but deepen our partnership on greater and increased commitment to integrity to our values.”\n\nYet even some sympathetic observers wondered whether such reassurances could meaningfully alter Europe’s trajectory. The momentum toward self-reliance had already begun during Trump’s first presidency, accelerated during the war in Ukraine, and now appeared irreversible.\n\nThe evidence was everywhere at MSC. Defense tech start-ups, particularly from Ukraine, made battlefield technology designed explicitly to reduce dependence on US suppliers. Panels focused on European industrial capacity, supply-chain resilience, and independent command structures. And in his speech, Merz highlighted that the German army is establishing the largest brigade in modern German history outside of its own territory, in Lithuania, as well as talks with French President Emmanuel Macron about renewed nuclear deterrence. Merz promised to “make the Bundeswehr the strongest conventional army in Europe as quickly as possible—an army that can stand its ground when it needs to.”\n\nWhat had once been framed as burden-sharing within an alliance was increasingly framed as preparation for its absence.\n\nThis shift was not purely military. It extended into energy, technology, and finance. European leaders spoke of building parallel systems that could function independently of US control—alternative payment networks, domestic semiconductor production, and sovereign cloud infrastructure.\n\nAll this said, there is little confidence that Europe can cleanly separate from the United States. US military power still underwrites Europe’s security architecture, and US intelligence remains indispensable.\n\nUnderlying these arguments was an implicit acknowledgment: The United States could no longer guarantee stability.\n\n“They see us as a wrecking ball,” Governor Newsom said, speaking to CNN’s Kacie Hunt. “They see us as unreliable, and a lot of them think it’s irrevocable. They don’t think we’ll ever come back to our original form.”\n\n“I’m not as convinced of that. Whatever happens, we can undo, we can shapeshift, we can fix it,” Newsom added, explaining that Trump was temporary.\n\nClimate change, in particular, emerged as a bridge between progressive domestic priorities and international security concerns. Panels discussed rising temperatures, migration pressures, and resource scarcity not as abstract environmental issues but as drivers of instability.\n\nThere was also recognition that the erosion of the transatlantic relationship would reshape global power dynamics far beyond Europe. China loomed large in discussions. A divided West, many warned, would weaken the collective ability to respond to Beijing’s economic and military ambitions.\n\nThe Munich Security Conference has always served as a kind of barometer of the Western alliance. During the Cold War, it was a forum for coordinating strategy against the Soviet Union. After the Cold War, it became a venue for managing the expansion of NATO and the integration of Eastern Europe.\n\nDespite the anxiety, there was little sense of imminent collapse. Institutions rarely disappear all at once. They weaken gradually, adjusting to new realities before anyone fully acknowledges what has been lost.\n\nFor decades, the Munich Security Conference served as a gathering of allies who assumed their shared future. This year, it felt increasingly like a gathering of partners preparing for uncertainty.\n\nThe conference will likely endure. But the US-led order it was built to stabilize is wobblier than ever.",

    "description": "Dave...",
    "fullText": "The basketball great once said he wanted to be like Muhammad Ali. He can’t do that and shrug off Israeli war crimes.\n\nTwenty-two years ago, I wrote this about a preternaturally mature 19-year-old hoops phenom named LeBron James and his aspirations off the court:\n\nJames has said he has two goals in his life. One is to be “a global icon like Muhammad Ali,” and the other is to be the richest athlete in the history of the world. And while these may be two great goals, they don’t exactly go great together. That’s because people like Muhammad Ali didn’t become global icons because they were rich, but because they were willing to sacrifice everything—including sponsorship deals—to stand up for what they believed in.\n\nIn the last two decades, we have seen how James’s desires have conflicted. During the early days of Black Lives Matter movement, he was outspoken in his support for racial justice. In 2012, he posed with his Miami Heat teammates in hoodies to protest the murder of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, and after the police killing of Eric Garner in 2014, he wore a T-shirt that said “I can’t breathe” during warm-ups alongside Cleveland Cavaliers teammate Kyrie Irving.\n\nYet over the last several years, as his fortune has exploded into the 10-figure category, James’s silence has been noticeable. Neither ICE’s killings nor the Trump regime’s relentless racism has moved him to speak forcefully. One perfect encapsulation of this untenable balancing act was in 2022 when he filed a trademark for the phrase “shut up and dribble.” When Fox News’s Laura Ingraham first bleated this at James in 2018, his supporters were enraged, and it became a rallying cry against the racism that Black athletes have long faced. Now one of James’s corporations says it will put it on items such as “downloadable virtual goods, namely, computer programs featuring footwear, clothing, headwear, eyewear, bags, sports bags, backpacks, sports equipment, art, toys and accessories for use online and in online virtual worlds.” The phrase will go from protest cry to branding exercise.\n\nThis week, the effort to balance the spirit of Muhammad Ali with his life as a 41-year-old billionaire tipped away from Ali. Actually, it didn’t just tip. It crashed to the ground. During NBA All-Star weekend, James was asked for his thoughts on Israeli All-Star Deni Avdija of the Portland Trailblazers. He took the opportunity to speak about Israel more broadly, saying, “If I have fans over there, then I hope you’ve been following my career. I hope I inspire people over there to be better in life. Hopefully someday I can make it over there. I’ve heard nothing but great things.”\n\nJames always speaks with great intentionality, and no one should think this was an off-the-cuff comment. It was a statement of support during the second year of a genocide in Gaza alongside the accelerating annexation of the West Bank. Israel has launched a project of ethnic cleansing, and James wanted the world to know that he was unbothered by it. Not only that—he seemed to want to follow in the footsteps of his good friend Draymond Green and take a propaganda trip to do public relations for the Israeli state.\n\nIf James’s defenders say that he doesn’t know what’s been happening and we shouldn’t expect more from “just an athlete,” they are being as ignorant as Ingraham. James knows what’s been going on in Gaza, and it’s ludicrous to think that he’s heard “nothing but great things” about Israel. He certainly hasn’t heard great things from his old Cavaliers running buddy Kyrie Irving, who has not been shy about showing his solidarity with the Palestinian people. He hasn’t heard great things from current and former NBA players like former teammate Dwight Howard or Tariq Abdul-Wahad or Etan Thomas and more who have spoken out against genocide and for a free Palestine. Hell, during this past weekend’s All-Star Game, Irving wore a PRESS shirt in solidarity with the journalists in Gaza killed by the Israeli army and Spike Lee wore the colors of the Palestinian flag courtside.\n\nJames knows what’s going on. Instead of fulfilling his teenage goal of being a hero to the downtrodden, he has chosen to turn his back on war crimes, permitting his fans to do the same. Perhaps he fears what a backlash will do to that other youthful dream of unfathomable wealth. Or maybe he just doesn’t care.\n\nIn contrast to James, Ali visited Palestinian refugee camps and went to Free Palestine demonstrations in the 1970s and ’80s until he was physically unable to do so. When asked why he would visit a refugee camp in Southern Lebanon, he said he had a responsibility to be there since “the United States is the stronghold of Zionism and imperialism.” Ali knew this would entail sacrifice, and he did it anyway because he both consciously and instinctively sided with the oppressed. And that’s why you can go to any outdoor market on earth today and find a knockoff Ali T-shirt for sale. That’s why he remains adored.\n\nJames came to a fork in the road and spit on the path laid by Ali before taking the path most traveled. One wonders what 19-year-old LeBron would think about his current self’s making this choice: the choice to reject Ali’s legacy and become just another billionaire stepping over Palestinian bodies to praise the Israeli state.",

    "fullText": "Japan dominated the short program in the women's figure skating at Milan-Cortina 2026 with their athletes occupying three of the top four places following the short program.\n\nAmi Nakai, 17, stormed to the top of the leaderboard with a season-best score of 78.71.\n\nShe is followed by three-time world champion Kaori Sakamoto, while compatriot Mone Chiba - who won bronze at last year's worlds - is in fourth.\n\nThey took advantage of errors by the fancied Americans, with reigning world champion Alysa Liu third and Amber Glenn well down the field.\n\nLiu, with her immediately recognisable halo hair and lip piercing, took the roof off the arena as her routine was acclaimed by spectators ranging from team-mate Ilia Malinin to rap icon Snoop Dogg.\n\nHowever, she lost points on her triple lutz for landing on the quarter – not fully completing the rotation, instead returning to the ice 90 degrees short.\n\nAmerican champion Glenn meanwhile suffered a disaster as she missed her triple loop – meaning it was scored as an invalid element, thus scoring zero points for that element.\n\nGlenn, 26, burst into tears as she exited the rink. She is 13th in the standings and knows her medal hopes are over.\n\nAdeliia Petrosian, the Russian champion competing as an Individual Neutral Athlete (AIN), is in fifth place.\n\nTeam GB's Kristen Spours - in her final event before injury-enforced retirement - finished 29th.\n\nThe Woking-born skater misses out on the free skate, with the top 24 progressing to the medals decider on Thursday evening.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nSo far, none of the AIN representatives, who come from countries which have been banned from competing at the 2026 Olympics, have won a medal.\n\nThe most likely candidate to change that is 18-year-old Petrosian, the Russian national champion.\n\nThe teenager is under the tutelage of controversial Eteri Tutberidze - the coach of Kamila Valieva at the last Olympics, and whose involvement with the Georgia figure skating team helped win the country's first ever Winter Olympic medal with pairs silver last night.\n\nShe was not listed as a coach for Petrosian on the official start list, and when receiving her score the teenager was only accompanied by listed coach Daniil Gleikhengauz - who has previously worked closely with Tutberidze.\n\nWearing a sparkling red jacket and black trousers, she had plenty of fans in Milan carrying banners bearing her face. However when she was first introduced in the rink there was a smattering of boos - unusual for figure skating.\n\nPetrosian has not been able to compete internationally because of the ban on Russian athletes by the International Skating Union, so this was a fascinating look at her on the global stage for the first time.\n\nAnd performing to a Michael Jackson medley, she lived up to the hype and showed her medal credentials with a spotless routine including an excelled triple flip and toe loop.\n\nIt earned her a season-best score of 72.89, and at the end of the routine her fans pelted the ice soft toys as a sign of appreciation.\n\nOne of the Jackson songs was They Don't Care About Us - possibly a pointed selection, given the focus on her presence at these Games.\n\nFor much of last year, it seemed very unlikely that British champion Spours would compete at these Games.\n\nThe 25-year-old had disc herniation surgery last June and announced in September that she was taking a break to prioritise her physical and mental health.\n\nBut that break helped her rediscover her love of the sport, and she skated here in one final performance before retirement.\n\nSpours was at a firm disadvantage as her injury left her unable to perform a double axel, one of the key elements of the short program. The element requires pressure through the left leg, something she is unable to do without the risk of falling and aggravating her back.\n\nAnd afterwards she revealed she had been nervous going into the event, leading to an early error on her loop element.\n\n\"I'm a little bit disappointed with my mistake on the day,\" she said. \"That is usually something that I can do in my sleep but it happens. I was more nervous today than I was coming into the team event so I'm happy.\"\n\nBut she entered the rink with a big smile and a peace sign to camera, and after scoring 45.54, could leave figure skating with her head held high.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Trent Alexander-Arnold said the alleged racist abuse of team-mate Vinicius Junior during Real Madrid's Champions League match at Benfica was a \"disgrace to football\", while opposition manager Jose Mourinho was criticised for his comments on the incident.\n\nThe match was halted for 10 minutes after Vinicius reported alleged racist abuse by Benfica's Gianluca Prestianni to referee Francois Letexier, and he and his team-mates temporarily left the field.\n\nThe Brazil forward, who has been the victim of numerous incidents of racist abuse during his playing career, said \"Racists are, above all, cowards\" in a post on his Instagram.\n\nBenfica manager Mourinho claimed Vinicius did not \"celebrate in a respectful way\" after his stunning goal in the 1-0 win preceded the incident at the Estadio da Luz.\n\nThe former Real Madrid and Chelsea boss said: \"There is something wrong because it happens in every stadium.\n\n\"A stadium where Vinicius plays something happens, always.\"\n\nReacting to Mourinho's comments, former Real Madrid midfielder Clarence Seedorf said on Amazon Prime: \"I think he is still emotional. I think he made a big mistake today to justify racial abuse.\n\n\"He's saying it's OK, when Vinicius provokes you, to be racist - and I think that is very wrong.\n\n\"We should never, ever justify racial abuse.

It is disgusting.\"\n\nMourinho was seen speaking with Vinicius after the 25-year-old took the decision to walk off the pitch following the interaction with Prestianni.\n\nThe Portuguese said in his post-match interview that he was told different things by Vinicius and Prestianni regarding the incident.\n\nIn addition to expressing his belief that Vinicius had been disrespectful with his celebration, he pointed to the club's legendary striker Eusebio as proof that Benfica is not a racist club.\n\nAsked if he felt Vinicius incited the crowd, Mourinho said: \"Yes. I believe so.\n\n\"It should be the crazy moment of the game, an amazing goal. Unfortunately [he was] not just happy to score that astonishing goal. When you score a goal like that, you celebrate in a respectful way.\"\n\nHe added: \"I told [Vinicius], when you score a goal like that you just celebrate and walk back. When he was arguing about racism, I told him the biggest person in the history of this club was black.\n\n\"This club, the last thing that it is, is racist. If in his mind there was something in relation to that, this is Benfica.\n\n\"They [Vinicius and Prestianni] told me different things. But I don't believe in one or another. I want to be an independent.\"\n\nSpeaking after watching Mourinho's interview, former England international Theo Walcott said on Amazon Prime: \"I am quite calm and composed and I am not someone who gets angry often.\n\n\"I love everything Jose Mourinho has done in football but I think he has made a poor decision in that sense. It was maybe the one time we shouldn't have heard from him, the one night he should not have been in front of the cameras.\"\n\nVinicius' Real Madrid team-mate Kylian Mbappe called for Argentina winger Prestianni to no longer be allowed to play in the Champions League following the alleged incident.\n\n\"Nothing like this has ever happened to me, and in these kinds of important matters, it's important to speak very clearly and not to speak in generalities,\" France forward Mbappe said.\n\n\"I have the utmost respect for Benfica and their coach, who is one of the best in history and who made history with Real Madrid. But, in my opinion, this player doesn't deserve to play in the Champions League anymore.\n\n\"We cannot accept that a player who plays in Europe's top competition behaves like this. This guy doesn't deserve to play in the Champions League anymore, but we'll see what happens.\n\n\"Let's leave it to Uefa, who always try to do something. Now they have a serious case, and I hope they do something.\"\n\nWith the two clubs set to meet for the second leg in Madrid next Wednesday, Walcott called for urgent action by Uefa.\n\n\"It's something that cannot be done in months and months, it needs to be dealt with immediately,\" Walcott said.\n\nFormer Arsenal striker Thierry Henry, speaking on CBS, reflected on his own experiences of racist abuse during his playing career.\n\n\"I can relate to what Vinicius Junior is going through. That happened to me so many times on the field. At times you feel lonely because it's going to be your word against his word, because we don't know what he has said,\" Henry said.\n\n\"He put his shirt over his mouth. Clearly, already, he looks suspicious because he didn't want people to see what he said.\n\n\"Let's see how big of a man Prestianni is – tell us what you said.\"\n\nReal Madrid tie halted over Vinicius racism allegation\n\nVinicius' brilliant winner beats Benfica in game halted for alleged racism",

    "fullText": "Real Madrid's Champions League knockout phase play-off tie at Benfica was halted for 10 minutes after Vinicius Junior reported alleged racist abuse and he and his team-mates left the field.\n\nReferee Francois Letexier made the crossed arms gesture to signal racist abuse following a conversation with Vinicius.\n\nThe Brazil forward had put the Spanish visitors 1-0 up in the second half at the Estadio da Luz, before being booked for an excessive celebration.\n\nFollowing an interaction with Benfica's Gianluca Prestianni, Vinicius ran over to referee Letexier while gesturing towards the opposition player.\n\nA Real Madrid statement said Vinicius told the referee he had been racially abused by the Argentina winger.\n\nVinicius then walked off the pitch and was followed by his Real Madrid team-mates, but play restarted 10 minutes later, in the 60th minute.\n\nThe match was played out to its conclusion, with Real winning 1-0 after 12 minutes of stoppage time, during which an object thrown from the crowd struck Vinicius on the arm.\n\nAfter the match, Vinicius released a statement on Instagram condemning the incident.\n\n\"Racists are, above all, cowards. They need to put their shirts in their mouths to show how weak they are,\" said Vinicius.\n\n\"But they have the protection of others who, theoretically, have an obligation to punish them. Nothing that happened today is new in my life or in my team's life.\n\n\"I received a yellow card for celebrating a goal. I still don't understand why. On the other hand, it was just a poorly executed protocol that served no purpose.\"\n\nBenfica forward Vangelis Pavlidis defended team-mate Prestianni.\n\n\"I don't think Prestianni said anything like that to Vinicius. I think it has more to do with the heated rivalry between Brazil and Argentina than anything else,\" he said.\n\nMourinho's 'big mistake' after 'disgusting' Vinicius incident\n\nVinicius' brilliant winner beats Benfica in game halted for alleged racism\n\nA statement from the Brazilian Football Confederation read: \"Racism is a crime. It is unacceptable. It cannot exist in football or anywhere else.\"\n\n\"Vini, you are not alone. Your decision to activate the protocol is an example of courage and dignity. We are proud of you.\n\n\"We will remain steadfast in the fight against all forms of discrimination. We stand by your side. Always.\"\n\nThe crossed-arms gesture to signal racist abuse was introduced by Fifa in May 2024.\n\nIt is made by an on-field referee if they observe or receive a report of abuse.\n\nObjects were seen being thrown from the crowd as Vinicius, 25, danced by the corner flag after scoring a stunning goal in the 50th minute.\n\nThat sparked a disagreement between the players on the pitch, following which Vinicius and Prestianni were seen interacting on the halfway line.\n\nThe Real star led his team-mates off the pitch after reporting the incident and spoke with Benfica manager Jose Mourinho as staff members from both sides became involved.\n\nVinicius has been the victim of numerous incidents of racist abuse during his playing career.\n\nFive people were handed suspended prison sentences for racially abusing him last year – the first time that a conviction for racism at a football match in Spain has been handed out.\n\nUefa established a three-step racism protocol to handle incidents of discrimination inside stadiums in 2009.\n\nIt is designed to give referees the power to halt or even abandon matches if racist behaviour continues.\n\nIf the referee becomes aware of a racist incident, they will:\n\nStop the match. If the incident involves members of the crowd, an announcement will be made over the public address system calling for any racist behaviour to stop.\n\nIf it continues, the game is stopped for five to 10 minutes and the players will be taken off the pitch while another announcement is made.\n\nIf it resumes after the second restart, the referee can abandon the game.\n\nA match will only be abandoned once the security of the players and public has been assessed. The case is then referred to Uefa's disciplinary authorities.\n\n20 September 2022 - Atletico Madrid condemn \"unacceptable\" chants by a \"minority\" of fans towards Vinicius outside their stadium before a La Liga derby with Real Madrid.\n\n26 January 2023 - La Liga says it \"strongly condemns acts of hatred and intimidation against Vinicius Jr\" after an effigy of him was hung from a bridge near the club's training ground. Four men are fined 60,000 euros (£51,700) and given a two-year stadium ban for the act.\n\n21 May 2023 - Vinicius suffers racist abuse at Valencia but is sent off for violent conduct in the 97th minute after an altercation with striker Hugo Duro. Earlier in the game, an incensed Vinicius attempts to bring Valencia fans to the referee's attention.\n\n22 May 2023 - Real Madrid file the incident to the Spanish prosecutor's office as a hate crime.\n\n19 March 2024 - Real Madrid file complaint after referee Juan Martinez Munuera omits alleged racist abuse allegations from fans towards Vinicius in his report after the club's match against Osasuna.\n\n25 March 2024 - Vinicius says he feels \"less and less\" like playing football because of the repeated racist abuse he has suffered.\n\n10 June 2024 - Vinicius says he is a \"tormentor of racists\" after three Valencia fans are sentenced to eight months in prison for abusing him at a match in May 2023.\n\n29 November 2024 - Real Madrid hand a minor a one-year stadium ban and fine for racially abusing Vinicius during the club's match against Rayo Vallecano the previous season.\n\n21 May 2025 - Five people are handed suspended prison sentences for racially abusing Vinicius in an \"unprecedented\" ruling in Spain. The incident occurred during Real Madrid's match against Real Valladolid in September 2022.\n\n17 February 2026 - Real Madrid's Champions League knockout phase play-off tie at Benfica is halted for 10 minutes after Vinicius and his team-mates leave the field.",

    "fullText": "Six Russian and four Belarusian athletes will compete under their nations' flags at the upcoming Winter Paralympics.\n\nIn September, the International Paralympic Committee lifted its ban on athletes from the two countries competing at the Games.\n\nBoth countries were suspended from Paralympic competition after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, with Belarus a close ally of Russia. A partial ban - allowing athletes to compete as neutrals - was introduced in 2023.\n\nHowever, the four individual governing bodies in charge of the six sports contested at the Paralympics decided to keep their bans in place.\n\nIn December, Russia and Belarus won an appeal against FIS - the governing body for skiing and snowboarding - at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas), permitting them to compete and accumulate ranking points.\n\nThe IPC confirmed to BBC Sport that the 10 athletes have been awarded bipartite commission invitations to compete in Para-alpine skiing, Para-cross country skiing and Para-snowboarding at the Milan-Cortina Games.\n\n\"The IPC can confirm that NPC Russia has been awarded a total of six slots: two in Para-alpine skiing (one male, one female), two in Para-cross country skiing (one male, one female), and two in Para-snowboard (both male),\" it said in a statement.\n\n\"NPC Belarus has been awarded four slots in total, all in cross-country skiing (one male and three female).\"\n\nCulture Secretary Lisa Nandy said it was \"completely the wrong decision\".\n\n\"Allowing athletes from Russia and Belarus to compete under their own flags while the brutal invasion of Ukraine continues sends a terrible message,\" Nandy wrote on X.\n\n\"The International Paralympic Committee should reconsider this decision urgently.\"\n\nBipartite commission invites are granted to individual athletes, rather than their international federation, and allow the participation of top athletes \"who may not have had the opportunity to qualify through other methods due to extraordinary circumstances\", among other factors.\n\nUkraine has also been awarded bipartite slots in three sports.\n\nIt will mark the first time a Russian flag has been flown at a Paralympic Games since the Sochi 2014 Games, firstly due to the country's state-sponsored doping programme, before the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nRussian news agency TASS reports that among the athletes set to compete are Aleksey Bugaev, a three-time Paralympic champion in alpine skiing, and cross-country skiers Ivan Golubkov and Anastasiia Bagiian - both are World Championship medallists.\n\nAll three returned to competition in January, and both Bugaev and Bagiian have since won World Cup titles.\n\nThe Milan-Cortina Winter Paralympics will take place from 6-15 March.",

    "fullText": "Team GB's Winter Olympics curling medal hopes are now in serious jeopardy after Bruce Mouat's world champions were beaten 9-5 by Canada in Cortina.\n\nArriving in Italy as gold-medal favourites, the British quartet have lost four of their eight matches in a round-robin stage full of maybes and might have beens.\n\nNow, they must beat the United States in their final game on Wednesday (13:05 GMT) - and hope either Italy or Norway fail to win both their closing games, against the Canadians and the unbeaten Swiss - to reach Thursday's semi-finals and salvage their podium prospects.\n\nThe 2022 silver medallists have spoken all week of playing well, but coming out on the wrong side of the narrow margins. And that was the case again against their great rivals high in the Dolomites.\n\nA shot here and a shot there was the difference, as Canada kept their shape better in the big moments and confirmed their own progress.\n\n\"That wasn't a game where we played well,\" vice-skip Grant Hardie told BBC Sport. \"We made too many mistakes and we're running out of time to put it right.\n\n\"I think we can deliver the right result tomorrow and hopefully get into the semis.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nMouat's rink have an excellent record against Brad Jacobs' team, and beat them in the last four of the worlds last spring.\n\nBut the Canadians knew they could improve their own chances - and inflict a little revenge - and they started strongly, opening a 3-1 lead after three ends.\n\nThe British team are considered the world's best, though, and righted themselves. Capitalising on a slight drop off by their opponents, they took two themselves in the fourth and another two in the sixth to lead with four to play.\n\nHowever, the clank of granite went against them in the seventh, an unfortunate bounce leaving Canada the chance of three, which they gladly took.\n\nMouat and his team needed to respond. They couldn't. Instead, they gave up a steal to leave themselves with a three-point deficit with two ends to play.\n\nIt was a deficit that they could not overcome. And now, their aspirations of upgrading their silver medal from Beijing are no longer in their own hands.\n\nGB's women are also in a perilous position, and also must beat the United States on Wednesday (08:05), as well as Japan later in the day (18:05) and Italy on Thursday (13:05) if they are to scrape into the last four.\n\nTeam GB finished 12th in the two-man bobsleigh after brakeman Taylor Lawrence withdrew from the final two runs and was replaced by Leon Greenwood.\n\nA statement from Team GB said that Lawrence, who missed several World Cup races last season because of a calf injury, sat out the race as a \"precautionary measure\" in preparation for the four-man event that begins later this week.\n\nGreenwood, making his Olympic debut, and pilot Brad Hall clocked 55.72 seconds and 56.17secs to give them a combined overall time of 3:43:43.\n\nIt was a disappointing showing from Hall, who is GB's most decorated men's bobsleigh pilot in World Cup history with 30 race medals.\n\n\"It wasn't plan A but with Leon [Greenwood] coming in last minute, we wanted to keep Taylor [Lawrence] safe, ready for the four-man,\" Hall told BBC Sport.\n\n\"We knew we were out of contention for the two-man so we just used it as extra training runs for the four-man.\"\n\nIt was a German clean sweep on the podium as Johannes Lochner and Georg Fleischhauer won gold while legendary pilot Francesco Friedrich and Alexander Schuller took silver with Adam Ammour and Alexander Schaller bronze.\n\nThe four-man event begins on Saturday with the medal-deciding runs on Sunday.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",
