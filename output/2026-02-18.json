    "fullText": "The stadium at the Centro de Alto Rendimento de Futebol Feminino (CARFEM) in Ypané holds a special chapter in the career of defender Sofia. It was there, at the very same place where the Brazilian National Team is currently based, that the defender won her first South American title wearing the Amarelinha jersey. With the U-17 team, she not only lifted the trophy but also left her mark: she sealed the 5-1 rout against Paraguay that secured the continental trophy.\n\nNow, competing in the South American Championship for the second time in her career, this time with the U-20 National Team, Sofia returns to the same environment that helped shape her identity in the National Team. More mature, she carries the memories of a campaign that marked a turning point in her career as an athlete. \"The U-17 South American was my first important competition with the national team, and it was incredible. We won, there was a really good energy among the players too. I think I didn’t have as much experience as some of the others, but at the same time I grew along with them, because it was a new squad. It was amazing,\" she recalled in an interview with CBFTV.\n\nSofia during the match against Paraguay in the first game of the final stage of the U-20 South American ChampionshipCredits: Staff Images / CBF\n\nThe CARFEM Stadium was not just the setting for the title. It was also where Sofia scored her first goal for the National Team. Against Paraguay, in front of a loud opposing crowd, she netted the last goal of the championship campaign. \"My first goal with the national team was here at CARFEM, against Paraguay. It was an incredible feeling. There were Paraguayan fans here, drums beating, I scored the last goal, the title-winning goal. I was very happy to have fulfilled that dream with the national team, especially in a tournament of that size,\" she said.\n\nThe victory was followed by the U-17 World Cup, an experience that brought new challenges and lessons. Eliminated in the early stage, Brazil did not achieve the expected goal, but it was essential for the athlete’s development. \"It was very challenging. I think I grew even more there, you know? It was a turning point for me. I think we learn from defeat. We closed that cycle that way, with many lessons learned,\" she stated.\n\nSofia during the match against Peru in the U-20 South American Championship in ParaguayCredits: Staff Images / CBF\n\nBorn in the Grajaú neighborhood, in the North Zone of Rio de Janeiro, Sofia started playing football as a child, directly influenced by her twin brother. The bond between the two was the starting point for a journey that would lead her to the Brazilian National Team. \"I started when I was about six, following my brother. He went to play football and I went to ballet. Then I said: mom, I want to go too. That’s when I started with him,\" she recounted.\n\nSofia began at the Grajaú Tênis Clube soccer school, where she stayed until she was 11. She later stepped away due to a lack of opportunities for girls at the time. Even so, football never left her routine. \"From 11 to about 13 or 14, I would go to the club every day with my brother to play ball. It was just me and him after school.\"\n\nSofia during a training session with the Brazil U-20 National Team in Ypané, ParaguayCredits: Staff Images / CBF\n\nAt 15, she decided to fully pursue her dream. Her mother found a tryout at Flamengo, and Sofia seized the opportunity. \"I did the tryout, passed at Flamengo, and was first monitored from 2022 until the beginning of 2023. Then I moved up to the U-17 at 15. And I’m still at Flamengo today,\" she celebrated.\n\n\"Everyone says it was a very fast progression. When I played in 2023 at Flamengo, I didn’t even know how to control the ball properly on the field. I had a lot of futsal habits. Then I started to learn, I learned to play as a defender because I was tall and fast,\" she added.\n\nSofia’s first call-up was for the Algarve Tournament in Portugal. One of the most memorable moments in her journey. \"The list came out, I was at home. When I saw it, I started crying. My mother cried, my brother cried, my cousin cried. It was unforgettable,\" she recalled.\n\nFamily support was decisive at every stage. Her father, a passionate Flamengo fan, was the one who introduced her to football by taking her to stadiums. Her mother and grandmother took on the role of logistical and emotional support, accompanying her to practices and trips. Her brother, a water polo athlete at Flamengo, remains one of her biggest supporters.\n\n\"I have a wonderful family core. For my mother, it’s very easy. For my grandmother, it’s harder to understand that I train every day, travel, but from the beginning she took me to practices. My father moved far away but keeps up and wants to know everything. And my brother is a ‘doting’ one. Whenever he can, he watches my games and I watch his,\" she said.\n\nNayara, Sofia, and Elu during the National Anthem before a match in the U-20 South American Championship in ParaguayCredits: Staff Images / CBF\n\nBack at the South American Championship, Sofia is now experiencing a new moment. More experienced, she observes the team’s growth throughout the competition and faces the challenge with confidence. \"We talk a lot as a group about being on an upward trajectory. I think we learned what we needed to in the first phase, and now every game is a final,\" she said.\n\nThe campaign so far has brought obstacles, from intense heat to traditional rivals like Argentina. All of it, according to her, served as a lesson. \"It was a tough phase to understand the climate, the refereeing, the other teams. But I think now it’s about going all out with everything we have,\" she explained.\n\nBrazil faces Colombia at 8 p.m. (Brasília time) next Thursday (19th), for the second round of the final stage of the U-20 Women’s South American Championship, at Estádio Luis Alfonso Giagni, in the Paraguayan city of Villa Elisa. Even with the pressure of the decisive stages, for Sofia, the prevailing feeling is the best possible. \"There’s a bit more nervousness, but at the same time there’s a lot of motivation. We’ve already experienced what we needed to, we’ve already won, we’ve already lost. Now it’s more motivation than anything else,\" she concluded.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence. You can read the original version in 🇧🇷 here.",

    "fullText": "Whether you like it or not, NCAA Division III women’s wrestling programs will host their own championship during the 2027-28 season.\n\nThe reason? Competitive balance.\n\nIt should shock no one that this was the inevitable direction for women’s college wrestling. Division III schools do not offer athletic scholarships, so a separate end-of-year tournament makes sense.\n\nD3 Hobart College in Geneva, New York, doesn’t face Power Four Alabama for the NCAA men’s football championship. Why would D3 Eureka College in Eureka, Illinois, face Power Four Iowa for the NCAA women’s wrestling title?\n\n“Any time an athletic director adds a sport, the first question they will ask is if we can be reasonably competitive to justify it,” NCWA executive director Mike Moyer said. “No athletic director wants to add a sport where they can’t provide a quality experience. It doesn’t mean they have to win a national title. They just want to know if we can reasonably provide a good experience.”\n\nThis is what competitive sports do.\n\nDouble A teams play Double A teams in baseball.\n\nG League teams play G League teams in basketball.\n\nD3 schools face other D3 schools in wrestling.\n\n“The split was a long time coming, and in the grand scheme of women’s wrestling, it allows us to continue to grow at a high rate,” Eastern coach Andrew Taylor said. “With Division III passing the vote to split off for our own championships, Division II and Division I can use the momentum to continue their growth as well.\n\n\"The split was a long time coming.\" - Eastern coach Andrew Taylor\n\n“For our program at Eastern, it really only changes how we approach things for two weekends out of the year. We will still be recruiting athletes who want to chase World Teams, and we will still be creating a schedule that allows us to compete against some of the best programs in the country in all divisions.\n\n“I am excited for what the leadership committee can do to create an incredible event, and our goal will be to chase a team trophy in that first year.”\n\nFor the next two years, all three divisions will compete at the NCAA Women’s Wrestling Championships in March. This offers a unique historical opportunity for Division III programs to win championships and become All-Americans against their D1 and D2 counterparts.\n\nNorth Central — a Division III program in Naperville, Illinois — is the outlier. The Cardinals won the 2023 National Collegiate Women’s Wrestling Championships (without Iowa), then finished second to the Hawkeyes in 2024 and 2025.\n\nThe Joe Norton-led squad won the 2026 NWCA National Duals on January 9-10, handing Iowa its first dual loss in program history with a 23-21 semifinal win. North Central defeated McKendree in the finals, 21-18, for its first National Duals title after finishing second for three straight years.\n\nNews of the D3 split was announced on January 16, leading some to speculate that North Central’s recent National Duals success against D1 and D2 teams played a factor.\n\nThe driving force was the announcement that the NCAA Championships would feature 18-woman brackets at each of the 10 weights. Had it been 21 or 24 qualifiers per weight, a split may have been delayed.\n\nNCAA women's programs by division\n\nNorth Central’s four-season run is staggering. The Cardinals are 55-5 in duals, and have placed 145, 160, and 110.5 points ahead of the next closest Division III team at the national championships.\n\n“I hate (the split),” Norton said. “Selfishly, I hate it.”\n\n“If you asked our women if they want to go and have the experience they had last year, they would take it. We lost by 19.5 points, but we were winning going into day two. To have that experience and to go toe-to-toe with the Hawkeyes and fall short and lose, or win by 145 points? Our girls would choose losing. Our girls would take the experience they had over winning by 145 points (at the Division III NCAA Championships).\n\n\"Selfishly, I hate the split.\" - North Central coach Joe Norton\n\n“I’m answering questions right now from recruits that don’t want to come here because we are going to be D3. Over time, we aren’t going to have that level of athlete, regardless of how good our coaching staff is. It’s not like we go D3 and we’re not as good of coaches. We’re the same coaching staff, but we’re not going to coach the same high-level athletes.”\n\nNorton won’t go down without a fight. He’s exploring a multidivisional classification that allows a Division III program to compete at the highest level. That’s why the Franklin & Marshall (D3) and Lock Haven (D2) men’s wrestling teams compete at the NCAA D1 Championships.\n\nThe multidivisional rule no longer exists, but Norton will petition. Moving from D3 to D1 is a 12-year process for an athletic program, so that’s off the table. He will use St. Thomas University to bolster his case. The NCAA granted the Tommies permission to move directly from D3 to D1 in 2021.\n\nCould the North Central women’s wrestling team do the same?\n\nHere’s where it gets tricky. Athletic directors want to win championships. Is it better to win a D3 team championship just like every other program at North Central is striving to do, or go toe-to-toe against Iowa, McKendree, and Grand Valley State to possibly finish second or fourth, or 10th?\n\nOr, with the right tournament and the right recruits, maybe you win one at the highest level.\n\n\"You can’t win the lotto if you don’t buy a lotto ticket.” - Joe Norton\n\n“We’re not asking for scholarships; we just want to compete in the national collegiate tournament, which is Division I and II for women’s wrestling. That’s still my optimistic hope. That’s what we want to do. Our athletic director has to agree, and our president has to agree. We can’t do anything if our president doesn’t agree to do it. And the NCAA would have to approve a petition.\n\n“The odds are, in 2028, we are going to be Division III, but we are going to take this shot in the dark and see what happens. I’ve also told every girl, if you come here and we split off, and we don’t get to petition up, I’ll make the right calls to get you to the right place. I’m not going to handcuff you and make you stay here. If that’s your dream and you want to go do that, then we’ll do it. We’ll find the right program for you. I just told a recruit that yesterday.\n\n“No one thought we were going to beat Iowa. We’re going to try. You can’t win the lotto if you don’t buy a lotto ticket.”\n\nFor now, D1 and D2 programs will host their own NCAA Championship when the D3 split happens, leaving more questions than answers.\n\nWill D2 programs split like D3, leaving eight D1 programs on an island? Division II has the minimum number of programs to make the request, so they may move forward with it.\n\n“I don’t know the answer to that, but I don’t know why they couldn’t,” Moyer said. “I’ve never been told they couldn’t, but I’ve never been told for certain if they can’t.\n\n“No matter what, we need to add a lot more D1 and D2 programs, and that’s exactly what the NWCA is working on.”\n\nAlso, how many national qualifiers will each division have? Under the current format, there are 18. It seems likely that the number will decrease when the split happens in 2028.\n\nWill it be 4 qualifiers? 8? 12? 16?\n\n“No matter what, we need to add a lot more D1 and D2 programs, and that’s exactly what the NWCA is working on.” - NWCA executive director Mike Moyer\n\nColorado Mesa coach Travis Mercado likes a challenge, including battles with the Hawkeyes, but he also likes the idea of winning a championship against comparable programs. As it stands today, the Mavericks will continue to face D1 teams like Iowa, Lehigh, Presbyterian, Lindenwood, Sacred Heart, and Delaware State.\n\n“Is it the right time (for D2 to split)? I don’t know,” Mercado said. “Competitive Travis Mercado and Colorado Mesa says, yes, we want to be able to compete amongst our peers and have an equitable opportunity to compete for a national championship against a similar school like Grand Valley State, McKendree, King, Quincy, and Fort Hays. Right now, you have one juggernaut in the University of Iowa.”\n\n“I think as Division I teams add and Division II teams add, then we can start to have this conversation of splitting off. I hope we’re at a point with women’s collegiate wrestling that we’re able to split off, we’ll have D1, D2, D3, NAIA, and junior college. I’m excited about that opportunity down the road. It might take two years. It might take five or 10.”\n\nEither way, the landscape of women’s college wrestling is changing — fast.\n\nKasey Kruczek, Wilkes\n“For me, I like seeing all the divisions wrestling together, but I also know how great it is to split off for those athletes with their training schedules. I think it comes down to preseason and postseason training schedules. Athletes can work out all year on their own, but I don’t get as much of the preseason with them as the other divisions. I get eight flex practices that I can coach with them, and our strength and conditioning coaches can work out with them, but I can’t be in there if it’s not on flex days.”\n\nTyler Keane, Western New England\n\"I love a D3 split. I think it allows Division III athletes to compete for a national title and All-American. Not that we don’t get to now, but this kind of evens the playing field. We have a bunch of athletes who are hungry for this split, and we can’t wait to compete. Right now, we’re focused and excited for the regional tournament and national tournament this year. When that D3 split happens, I think it gives a fair, competitive advantage for Division III athletes.\n\n\"I find it’s uneven when it comes to training. In terms of training and practices, and being able to be with your athletes during certain times of the year. Division I has more opportunities, and the big thing with D1 and D2 is athletic scholarships, which makes it difficult for D3, at least on my end, for recruiting.\"\n\nJoe Jamison, Ursinus\n\"I think in the long run, for the growth of the sport and for the sustainability of Division III, I think it’s important. Selfishly, I hate it right now. As a women’s wrestling coach at a Division III school, it’s been a lot of fun to compete at the highest level possible. Right now, we have a ton of talent on our team, and we’re excited to continue to pursue our goals and try to get girls on the podium and win national titles at the highest level. At the same time, for the longevity of the sport, I know the split is important as it is going to level the playing field for the schools that don’t have the same resources as Division I and Division II schools.\n\n\"It’s twofold. There’s the financial piece where it comes down to budgets, resources available, and scholarships. As a Division III school, for the most part, our budgets are going to be smaller than those of Division I and Division II schools. It’s just the nature of how it works. They can offer athletic scholarships where we can’t.\n\n\"The other piece is the rules piece. Division I and Division II institutions can mandate athletic hours the minute they step on campus. They can mandate off-season hours where they are either in the room or in the weight room. For us, in Division III, we’re not allowed to do that. Coaches are not allowed to be around their athletes in an athletic setting at all until official practice starts. Division I and II schools start practicing eight hours a week, where we can’t do anything that’s mandated or even be with them until October.\n\n\"A lot of Division III schools have found a way around that with RTCs. If you have one, you can do certain things. You can’t mandate it, but it is available.\"",

    "description": "Detroit Tigers shortstop Javier Báez addressed his suspension from the 2026 World Baseball Classic after a positive marijuana test during the 2023 tournament.",
    "fullText": "Javier Báez didn’t dodge responsibility. He didn’t deflect blame. And he didn’t sugarcoat how much it hurts.\n\nSpeaking Tuesday, Feb. 17, at spring training in Lakeland, the Detroit Tigers shortstop addressed his suspension from the 2026 World Baseball Classic, which will prevent him from representing Team Puerto Rico after testing positive for marijuana during the 2023 WBC.\n\n“I don’t want to point fingers at anybody because this is all my fault,” Báez said via the Detroit Free Press. “I’m the one that failed the test. … It’s just really frustrating that I won’t be able to be there. … It really hurts my family, my reputation, but it’s part of it. Other than that, I got a long season to go, and I got to prepare for that.”\n\nThe 2026 World Baseball Classic is scheduled to run from March 5–17, but Báez’s suspension — handed down by the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) — does not expire until April 26, making him ineligible for the tournament.\n\nWhile Major League Baseball has permitted marijuana use since 2020 under its jointly negotiated drug policy with the MLB Players Association, the WBSC still prohibits the substance. MLB and the MLBPA explored whether Báez could be cleared for the tournament, but those efforts ultimately failed.\n\n“I understand the rules,” Báez said. “It’s not like I was taking steroids or anything to last longer or whatever. They made that decision. I’m fine with it – I mean, I’m not fine with it. I just keep my mouth shut.”\n\nThe positive test dates back to March 12, 2023, during the previous WBC. As a result, Báez received a two-year period of ineligibility — from April 26, 2024, through April 26, 2026 — which bars him from WBSC-sanctioned events.\n\n“There are a lot of people mad and frustrated,” Báez said, “but it doesn’t hurt more than it hurts me. It’s time to turn the page and get ready for the season – and try to stay healthy.”\n\nThe timing makes the situation even more painful. Team Puerto Rico will host WBC games in 2026, marking the first time the tournament returns to the island since 2013. For Báez, the opportunity carried deep personal meaning.\n\n“One of my dreams is to play in Puerto Rico for Team Puerto Rico with our families, our fans, our island,” Báez said. “Nothing I can do. I’m just happy for all of my teammates that got the chance to represent. I wish them good luck.”\n\nBáez, who lives in Puerto Rico during the offseason, vividly remembers watching the inaugural 2006 World Baseball Classic as a 13-year-old fan in the stands at Hiram Bithorn Stadium in San Juan.\n\n“It’s been a long, long time since we played this tournament in Puerto Rico,” Báez said. “To have the chance to be a part of that, and now it’s away from me, it really hurts.”\n\nThe post Detroit Tigers’ Javier Báez Addresses Suspension, WBC Absence appeared first on Detroit Sports Nation.",

    "fullText": "Broncos have to be out on Breece Hall if Jets make predicted move originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Denver Broncos should make a concerted effort to upgrade the running back position this offseason. When they examine the free-agent market, the top name that should stand out is that of New York Jets running back Breece Hall.\n\nAs I have stated previously, Hall is the running back the Broncos should go all out to get ahead of the 2026 NFL season. He is a true three-down back; he fits what Sean Payton likes to do to a tee and he is still only 24 years old.\n\nHowever, his current team, the New York Jets, could foil any plans the Broncos may have of obtaining him.\n\nRecently, Adam Schefter of ESPN put together a list of players who could get the franchise tag placed on them, and Hall is one of those guys. Though the franchise tag doesn't shut down talks of a player moving on from that team, it makes it much more difficult to get them away from that team, and that was the purpose of the franchise tag in the first place.\n\nShould the Jets apply the tag to Hall, it would likely mean he would play at least the 2026 season with the Jets and it would allow the team extra time to come up with a long-term deal to keep him there much longer. If a team like the Broncos wanted to acquire him at that point, it would require giving up multiple first-round picks.\n\nIt would essentially end any thought the team may have of adding Hall to its offensive backfield. Instead, the Broncos would have to look at other options. Fortunately, there are plenty.\n\nWould Breece Hall be the missing piece on the Broncos offense to win a Super Bowl? | @TroyRenck@EricGoodman#BroncosCountry\n\nSponsored by https://t.co/ta6du3zyQx & https://t.co/7GdKA7T5Itpic.twitter.com/nWcwYPPDcz\n\n— Troy Renck (@TroyRenck) February 18, 2026\n\nKenneth Walker III was just named MVP of Super Bowl LX and Rico Dowdle is coming off a strong season with the Carolina Panthers. They are both scheduled to be unrestricted free agents. A more cost-friendly option, and one that would make plenty of sense, would be to grab Atlanta Falcons running back Tyler Allgeier.\n\nFinally, the Broncos could look at re-signing J.K. Dobbins and putting a lot of faith in him staying healthy. That would be a bit of a gamble, but the team does have options.\n\nMORE:Broncos not named as potential landing spot for Tyreek Hill following Dolphins release\n\nFor Broncos fans who were hoping to land Hall, they will have to hope that the Jets choose not to tag him. However, it would make sense for a Jets team that is looking to turn its fortunes around to make sure it keeps its best offensive player in the fold.\n\nBroncos may be getting an idea of cost for A.J.

    "fullText": "It is with sad hearts that we learn of the passing of George Barber, founder of the Barber Vintage Motorsports Museum. The AMA Motorcycle Hall of Famer was 85.\n\nBarber was a philanthropist, real estate developer and businessman, son of George Warren Barber Sr., who founded Barber Dairies in the 1930s. Barber Jr. began privately collecting motorcycles in the '70s, and in 1994, established a museum to display his collection to the public. In 2003, he opened Barber Motorsports Park in Birmingham, Alabama, where he relocated his museum.\n\nBarber Vintage Motorsports Museum: An Interview with George Barber\n\nThe AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame inducted Barber in 2014, in recognition of his efforts in preserving motorcycle history.\n\nThe American Motorcyclist Association is saddened to learn of the passing of AMA Motorcycle Hall of Famer George Barber, who passed away at 85 years old.\n\nFounder of the prestigious Barber Vintage Motorsports Museum in Birmingham, Ala., home to the world's largest collection of historic motorcycles, Barber had a unique impact on the motorcycling community.\n\nSon of George H. Barber, founder of Barber Dairy and pioneer for dairy pasteurization in the United States, the younger Barber's love for motor vehicles started early in his life. In the 1960s, Barber raced and wrenched on his own Porsche racers with great success, claiming a large collection of wins behind the wheel.\n\nBarber's interest in motorcycles began soon after, leading him to open his own museum and hire skilled workers to restore vintage motorcycles to help build his collection. At the same time, Barber operated a vintage motorcycle racing team, which raced across the United States and Europe.\n\nIn 1994, Barber's museum gained 501(c)(3) nonprofit status and was officially named the Barber Vintage Motorsports Museum.\n\nIn 2002, Barber opted to close the original location of the Barber Vintage Motorsports Museum, moving his collection to its current location in September 2003, an 830-acre complex that also includes a 2.38-mile road circuit.\n\nFor his longtime preservation of motorcycle history, Barber was inducted into the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame in 2014.\n\nBecome a Motorcycle.com insider.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAmber Glenn was expected to show out during the women's singles short program at the 2026 Winter Olympics. The three-time U.S. National champion is arguably the United States' finest talent in the event, leaping to gold at the 2024-25 Grand Prix.\n\nBut on Tuesday afternoon, with the eyes of the world watching, Glenn toiled. Her athleticism was still there as she pranced atop the slippery surface at Milano Ice Center.\n\nBut her precision was not. She missed an attempted triple loop, seeing her score tumble as a result. The drama was enough to leave her in tears.\n\nWith that, here's what you need to know about Glenn's short program routine.\n\nMORE 2026 OLYMPICS: Live medal tracker | Viewer's guide | Day-by-day schedule\n\nGlenn posted a 67.39 score on short program, good for 13th in the 29-skater field. She sits 11 points off the lead and nine points off the podium at the conclusion of Tuesday's routines.\n\nGlenn enjoyed early success in her program, showcasing her athleticism with a series of depth-defying jumps, including her patented triple axel.

That's not to say she can't overcome the deficit -- pairs star Riku Miura and Ryuichi Kihara came back from seven points down following their short program routine to take gold for Japan on Tuesday evening.\n\nShe'll need a nigh-on flawless to make it happen, however.\n\nMORE: USA figure skating star Alysa Liu dazzles in short program\n\nWhile Glenn's routine fell short of expectations, her short program soundtrack drew eyes -- and ears.\n\nThe choreography featured a familiar refrain for music fans of a certain generation: Madonna's \"Like a Prayer.\"\n\nGlenn says the suggestion came from her choreographer, Catherine Hill.\n\n\"'Like a Prayer' was a suggestion from my choreographer,\" Glenn told USA Today.\n\nShe was initially unconvinced, associating the tune with a children's choir cover of the track that was featured during two sequences in the 2024 film, \"Deadpool & Wolverine.\"\n\nHill was persistent in her push for Glenn to use the song, however. After parsing through the lyrics, Glenn was sold.\n\n\"Eventually, we really explored the meaning behind it and the passion that we could really pour into the program,\" Glenn said. \"I'm really happy with how it came out.\"\n\nGlenn wasn't the only one delighted with the decision to use the track.

    "fullText": "CLEARWATER, Fla.- Both Montverde Academy (Fla.) and Clearwater Calvary Christian (Fla.) were both teams that last season competed for the FHSAA’s Class 2A state championship, with the latter coming away with the title in the end.\n\nOn Tuesday night, the No. 3 ranked Eagles showed why they’re one of the country’s top ranked teams, getting a superb pitching performance from senior ace pitcher Nevaeh Williams in a 4-0 victory over the No. 20 Warriors. For Montverde Academy, they improved to 2-0 on the season and have yet to give up a run through two games.\n\nWilliams was terrific throughout the evening for Montverde Academy as the right-handed pitcher struck out more than 10 batters and yielded just one hit. Though Calvary Christian (0-1) had their chances, they couldn’t capitalize against Montverde Academy.\n\nThe Eagles (2-0) got on the board in the top of the third inning when junior Audrey Vivino scored on a double by senior shortstop Colby Reish, to give Montverde Academy a 1-0 lead. That’s all Williams needed, but the senior would get some additional run support in the fourth inning on a Cali Flowers score and then senior outfielder Addison Poe would blast a solo homer in the top of the fifth inning.\n\nMontverde Academy would tag on another run in the top of seventh for good measure as Williams finished a complete game in the bottom half of the frame.\n\nMontverde Academy, located in Montverde, Florida, is a private, co-educational school renowned for its strong academics, competitive athletics, and diverse extracurricular programs. The academy offers a range of AP and honors courses, preparing students for higher education and future careers. Montverde’s athletic teams are highly competitive, often achieving regional and national recognition. Emphasizing leadership, personal development, and community service, the school ensures students are well-prepared for future success.",

    "fullText": "With March Madness inching closer, Jay Bilas is ready to give his take on how the college basketball landscape looks with just three weeks of regular-season play left.\n\nBilas just released his ranking of the top 68 college basketball teams at ESPN, and the Kentucky Wildcats came in at No. 28. Just like the latest top-25 polls, Bilas isn’t ready to call these Wildcats a top-25 team just yet.\n\nHere’s what he had to say about Kentucky.\n\n“The early returns on this Kentucky team were not promising,” Bilas wrote. “The Wildcats opened the season 5-4 with lopsided losses to Michigan State and Gonzaga. And it hasn’t been all clear skies since — they scored only 55 points in a 25-point road loss at Vanderbilt on Jan. 27 — but they have righted the ship with a 12-4 response to their sputtering start. One clear difference has been the play of Otega Oweh. He averaged 13.7 points through those first nine games, but 18.8 in the 16 since. They’ll need him to maintain that with Kam Williams and Jayden Quaintance still out.”\n\nThe Wildcats actually have four wins over teams ranked ahead of them: No. 20 Arkansas, No. 19 St. John’s, and No. 16 Tennessee (twice). Kentucky also has wins over No. 31 Texas, No. 34 Indiana, and No. 61 LSU.\n\nAll eight of Kentucky’s losses are to teams in this ranking, the lowest being Missouri at No. 49. The other seven losses are against teams in the top 23 of this ranking.\n\nFlorida, who Kentucky just lost on the road to and hosts in the regular-season finale, checks in at No. 7.\n\nSo, do you like this spot for the Cats?

    "description": "This under-the-radar pick has made an incredible leap in his off-the-tee game in 2026",
    "fullText": "It’s been a heckuva start to the 2026 PGA Tour season. Last week delivered a compelling back nine with Collin Morikawa holding off charges from Scottie Scheffler and a slew of other contenders to get his first win on U.S. soil since 2021. It’s also been a fantastic start in the Golf Digest picks column. Collectively, our group is up over 25 units in just five events across matchup and top-10 bets. Plus, one of our writers, Stephen Hennnessey cashed Justin Rose at 60-1 in winning Torrey Pines a few weeks ago.\n\nIt’s tough to start much better. We’re wrapping up the West Coast swing with some confidence and cash in our pockets. See who our Golf Digest betting panel—which is comprised of Pat Mayo of Underdog/Mayo Media Network, Andy Lack of the Inside Sports Network, Ryan Noonan of Betsperts, your two authors and Keith Stewart, the CEO of Read The Line—are betting this week at The Riviera Country Club.\n\nWatch the Pat Mayo Experience betting show with Read The Line's Keith Stewart here.\n\nScroll down for our complete betting analysis of the 2026 Genesis Invitational:\n\nGenesis Invitational picks 2026: Our Experts’ Outright Predictions\n\nPat Mayo, Underdog/Fantasy National, Mayo Media Network analyst: Rory McIlroy (+1325, DraftKings) — Five or so holes completely sank McIlroy's chances at Pebble Beach. When Rory is losing strokes driving and putting in the same event chalk that up to a couple brain farts. His approach play, however, was one of the best of the week. At Riv, Rory’s driver will transform back into the weapon to dominate off the tee at a longer course, while his putting will likely bounce back since he’s been one of the best putters on tour over the past two years (+0.35/per round). After finally picking up his Augusta win, to go along with Quail Hollow and Bay Hill, Riviera is the last of the similar tracks he’s yet to take down.\n\nKeith Stewart, PGA, Read The Line: Rory McIlroy (+1325, DraftKings) — Course conditions at Riviera will favor players who are peaking with their iron game, can score on Poa Annua, and can separate themselves with the driver. Hello, Rory McIlroy! McIlroy gained 6.8 strokes on approach at Pebble Beach and recorded a 17-under-par total with two sevens on his card. Rory’s short game was sharp, and he carded 25 sub-par scores for the week. Coming off the confidence Augusta gave him last year, I’m taking McIlroy to capture another career trophy that has eluded him.\n\nRyan Noonan, Content Manager 4for4/Betsperts: Scottie Scheffler (+320, Bet365) — Scheffler hasn’t played at Riviera since his famed switch to the mallet putter. In fact, the 2024 Genesis Invitational was the last time he used a blade putter on tour. His Riviera history (T-10, T-12, T-7, T-20 in his past four starts) is quite pedestrian by Scheffler’s supremely high standards, but he has gained more strokes tee-to-green (27.09) than anyone else has at Riviera over that four-event stretch. Caddie Ted Scott has a ton of success around here as well, caddieing for three Bubba Watson wins at Riviera. I know he’s not swinging a club this week, but that experience certainly helps at a course that’s known for its strategic demands.\n\nStephen Hennessey, Golf Digest managing editor: Cameron Young (35-1, Caesars Sportsbook) — It's been two poor weeks in a row, but Cameron Young is a great fit for Riviera, so I’m willing to look at the longer-term data. Everyone was so high on him heading into 2026. CY is the best player in this field looking at SG/total at Riviera, which is the third-most predictive course of the year. Give us the ball-striking gains we saw at the end of 2025 with the short game he’s shown over the past year, and we have the formula to winning at Riviera.\n\nChristopher Powers, Golf Digest senior writer: Matt Fitzpatrick (36-1, DraftKings) — Can’t help but love what we’re seeing from Fitzy so far in 2026. If he didn’t leave one in the bunker on the 72nd last week, he likely finishes in the top 10 for a second week in a row. And he’s off to this strong start despite an ice-cold putter, which we know can flip on a dime. The Englishman ranks seventh on tour this year in SG/tee-to-green, a key indicator of success at this iconic golf course over the years.\n\nAndy Lack, Inside Sports Network: Matt Fitzpatrick (36-1, DraftKings) — Matt Fitzpatrick is coming off a 14th-place finish at Pebble Beach where he gained 2.8 strokes off the tee and 7.8 strokes on approach, and he has been playing some great golf dating back to the end of last season, which includes a victory at the DP World Tour Championship. Fitzpatrick’s elite short game should pay dividends at Riviera this week.\n\nPast results: We have our FIRST winner of 2026, with Stephen Hennessey correctly predicting Justin Rose’s victory at Torrey Pines at 60-1!\n\nListen to Golf Digest's weekly betting podcast, \"The Loop,\" (above) where we interview the industry's leading experts (and sometimes tour pros) to help you make your bets and pick your fantasy lineups. And be sure to \n\nGenesis Invitational picks 2026: Sleepers/Dark Horses Who Could Win\n\nMayo: Harris English (40-1, FanDuel) — Tough to go too far down the board at a signature event when the books have compressed all the odds, so English is the man for me. While nothing seems particularly different about his game in 2026, the stats reveal an incredible leap in his driving year over year. Sixteen rounds is a pretty small sample, but English is gaining almost a stroke per round off the tee, second of all players to Scottie Scheffler. That’s +0.75 SG:OTT per round more on average than his performance over the past last year and a half. While his irons have dipped a bit this year, in his two starts where he was forced to hit longer irons (like Riviera), he’s been in the positive.\n\nStewart: Sepp Straka (50-1, Caesars Sportsbook) — More and more, Sepp Straka is becoming a factor in signature series events. Straka won the Truist last year and just finished runner-up at Pebble Beach. What was even more impressive than second place was the manner in which Sepp achieved it. Straka gained significantly across all four major strokes-gained categories. Something that previous winners of the Genesis have done. An 18th at WM Phoenix, and a signature second at Pebble, I’m taking a player who can hit fairways, lead the field in GIR, save par, and score on Poa greens.\n\nNoonan: Harris English (40-1, FanDuel) — If you were to boil the handicap down to a few key things this week, one of them must be bogey avoidance. The scoring chances are limited at Riviera, but you make things more difficult when you give strokes back. English ranks third in this week’s field in bogey avoidance over the past three seasons, and he also has great course history at Torrey Pines, Augusta National and here at Riviera. English plays his best golf on longer, tougher tracks, and I won’t be surprised when he has a late tee time on Sunday afternoon.\n\nHennessey, Golf Digest: Harris English (40-1, FanDuel) — English has been super consistent in 2026, and he’s been hitting it great off the tee a bit under the radar. With a tougher test due to the wet conditions and more long irons, that plays into English’s hands.\n\nPowers, Golf Digest: Tony Finau (120-1, DraftKings) — Not to brag, but I caught Big Tone at 225-1 on Monday (tried to tell y’all). That’s been slashed but I’m still all in. Two runner-up finishes here in his career, plus three other top 20s. After a brutal season last year, he’s finished T-11 (Farmers) and 18th (Pebble) in two of his last three. The only signs of life I need to see to take a shot.\n\nLack: Maverick McNealy (55-1, BetOnline) — Maverick McNealy has been showing some serious flashes with his ball-striking, and he remains one of the best Poa putters in this field. McNealy already has a seventh-place finish at Riviera, and I expect him to continue his strong play in California.\n\nGenesis Invitational picks 2026: Players We’re Fading\n\nMayo: Cameron Young (28-1, Bet365) — Until he can find his irons on a consistent basis, a second shot course like Riv is going to give him fits… and a lot of bogeys to sink his easy birdies.\n\nStewart: Cameron Young (28-1, Bet365) — This will be a polarizing pick. Cameron Young made a name for himself in 2022 when he finished runner-up at the Genesis Invitational. Since then, Young has racked up two more top 20s at Riviera. Why the fade? Cameron’s iron game has been off in his two most recent starts and three of his last four, going back to the Hero. Coupled with losing strokes at Pebble Beach and Torrey Pines on Poa greens in the last three weeks, I’ll let the rest of the pundits pick Young to win.\n\nNoonan: Sam Burns (33-1, FanDuel) — Maybe it’s just the fact that I can’t get over him hitting an iron off the 18th tee at Pebble … down two shots … on a hole where an eagle was in play, even in those conditions. I can’t unsee it.\n\nHennessey, Golf Digest: Russell Henley (22-1, BetRivers) — I love betting Henley as much as anybody, but I’ll do so on a shorter Bermuda course with more wedge shots.\n\nPowers, Golf Digest: Si Woo Kim (28-1, BetRivers) — Si Woo has been scorching hot to start the year, but I’m going to play the fatigue angle here. This will be his sixth straight week teeing it up. It may have already caught up to him at Pebble, where he tied for 45th, and he needed a final-round 65 just to do that.\n\nLack: Russell Henley (22-1, BetRivers) — With Riviera playing long and cold this year, Russell Henley’s lack of distance may be a serious problem. Henley is an elite wedge player and an extremely accurate driver, two skills that will be significantly diminished based on the course conditions I am expecting this week.\n\nGenesis Invitational picks 2026: Matchups\n\nMayo: Michael Kim (-110) over Kevin Yu (Coolbet) — My guy MK has been spotty since the calendar flipped, and spotty is miles ahead of Kevin Yu. Since three straight top 20s to begin the swing season, Yu lost his swing. Always one of the more reliable drivers of the ball the past few seasons, he’s lost that ability—and the rest of his game hasn’t been able to bail him out. Yu’s currently losing almost a stroke per round ball-striking in 2026.\n\nStewart: Jason Day (-120) over J.J. Spaun (FanDuel) — Jason Day has back-to-back top nine results playing in the Genesis at Riviera. Any course that requires Poa savvy and great iron play is a good fit for the Aussie. The Kikuyu rough will be familiar, and outside of a couple of poor iron shots at Pebble Beach, Day’s game is on point. J.J. Spaun is having serious issues with his putter. Spaun is losing an average of 3.2 strokes per event in his last four starts. To compound the challenge, Spaun lost nearly five strokes with the flatstick in his last start at Riviera (2024).\n\nNoonan: Tommy Fleetwood (-111) over Xander Schauffele (BetMGM) — Fleetwood is fourth in my model this week, and would likely be my top outright ticket if I were skipping Scottie. He models very well for me in a few key ball-striking stats, including his Good Drive% on long courses with difficult GIR accuracy. Xander lost over a stroke on approach in both weekend rounds at Pebble Beach, which shouldn’t instill a lot of confidence for those looking to back him this week.\n\nHennessey, Golf Digest: Collin Morikawa (-110) over Russell Henley (FanDuel) — I was tempted to bet Morikawa outright, but it’s so tough to go back to back. I’ll take him at a spot where he’s excelled before over my fade, Henley, who hasn’t had the best start to his 2026.\n\nPowers, Golf Digest: Matt Fitzpatrick (-120) over Ludvig Aberg (Bet365) — My pick to win over the defending champ (Torrey Pines). Very odd start to the year for Ludvig, who withdrew from AMEX with an illness, MC’d at Farmers, then opened with a 75 at the AT&T before clawing back to finish T-37. He has the talent to correct quickly, but Fitz is humming right now and might win if he catches fire with the flat stick.\n\nLack: Patrick Cantlay (-110) over Collin Morikawa (Southpoint) — I have no problem fading Collin Morikawa off a huge win, as Riviera will be a much more difficult test. Patrick Cantlay also performed well at Pebble Beach, and his distance off the tee and superior putting make him a safer bet this week.\n\nMatchup Results from the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am: Lack: 1 for 1 (Cantlay (-105) over Young); Powers: 1 for 1 (Fleetwood (-120) over Rose); Mayo: 1 for 1 (Straka (+112) over Bradley); Stewart: PUSH (Day (+100) over English); Hennessey: 0 for 1; Noonan: 0 for 1\n\nMatchup Results from the 2026 season (Wins-Losses-Pushes): Lack: 5-0-0 (up 4.26 units); Stewart: 3-0-1 (up 2.65 units); Powers: 4-1-0 (up 2.61 units); Mayo: 3-2-0 (up 1.26 units); Hennessey: 2-3-0 (down 1.17 units); Noonan: 1-4-0 (down 3.05 units)\n\nGenesis Invitational picks 2026: Top 10s\n\nMayo: Matt Fitzpatrick (+320, FanDuel) — Fresh off the best approach week of career, Fitz is now crushing both driving and iron play to kick off the season. Problem is, he hasn’t been able to chip or putt; two of his historic strengths. While it’s possible his ball-striking reverts to non-elite level, in the off chance he can keep it up and see his short game return to normal, then we have someone who will be near the top of the leader board.\n\nStewart: Hideki Matsuyama (+240, BetRivers) — In four starts this season, Hideki Matsuyama has finished T-13 at Sony, T-11 at Farmers, second at WMPO, and T-8 at the AT&T. The iron play is exquisite, and the short game is currently the best in the field. Matsuyama even gained with the putter in his last two outings. The 2024 Genesis winner only has one issue, and that is the driver. Without the big stick, I can’t justify the outright pick, but finishing top 10 as the defending venue champ is well within his current run.\n\nNoonan: Collin Morikawa (+250, FanDuel) — Morikawa is second in my model at Betsperts Golf this week. Yeah, Scheffler is first. For the record, he was second even before we had the Pebble Beach data. He leads the field in the Good Drive% on long courses with difficult GIR% and can meet the unique ball-striking demands of this venue. Dating back to the start of 2024, Morikawa is second in this field in SG/ball-striking when it’s difficult to gain off the tee and difficult to hit the green in regulation. There’s been a lot of overlap with leader boards at Riviera, Augusta National and Torrey Pines, and Morikawa rates out highly there as well, despite never winning at any of these venues.\n\nHennessey, Golf Digest: Matt Fitzpatrick (+320, FanDuel) — Fitz agonizingly left one in the bunker on the 72nd hole on Sunday, costing me a top-10 ticket last week. I’ll go back to the well after his best approach week of his career.\n\nPowers, Golf Digest: Rickie Fowler (+410, FanDuel) — Rick has quietly finished inside the top 20 in all three starts he’s made this year, and he’s returned to his 2022-’23 form with his irons. Driver has never been his strong suit, but he has had a few solid rounds with it in the last two weeks: Sunday at WMPO, when he ranked fourth in the field in SG/off-the-tee, and last Thursday at Pebble, when he gained 1.127 OTT.\n\nLack: Harris English (+300, BetRivers) — Harris English is one of my favorite plays on the slate this week, and he has been hitting his driver unbelievably well. English also possesses a great short game and finished seventh at Riviera in his last appearance at this event.\n\nTop-10 results from the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am: Mayo: 1 for 1 (Sepp Straka +500); Everybody else: 0 for 1\n\nTop-10 results from the 2026 season: Noonan: 2 for 5 (up 6.1 units); Mayo: 3 for 5 (up 11.7 units); Stewart: 2 for 5 (up 3.65 units); Lack: 1 for 5 (up 2 units); Powers: 1 for 5 (up 0.1 units); Hennessey: 0 for 5 (down 5 units)\n\nPat Mayo is an award-winning video host and producer of long and short-form content, and the host of The Pat Mayo Experience daily talk show.

    "fullText": "Vini Jr.'s celebration after scoring the goal that sealed Real Madrid's victory over Benfica was one of the main topics addressed by the Portuguese coach after the match at Estádio da Luz.\n\nMourinho – who had a heated argument with the Brazilian – avoided commenting on the possible racist act committed by Prestianni.\n\n\"One thing is what Vinícius says, another is what Prestianni says, completely different things. I try to be balanced and I don't want to say that Vinícius is a liar and Prestianni is an incredible guy.\"\n\nIn his view, Real's number 7 \"ended the game\" because of his celebration near one of the corner flags and in front of the Benfica fans.\n\n\"I told Vinícius, independently, that when a player scores a goal like that, he should be carried on the shoulders (of his teammates). You don't go messing with a stadium or with the heart of the opponent's stadium. As they say in Spain, whoever scores a goal like that cuts tail and ear and doesn't finish the game, and he ended the game.\"\n\n\"I told Vinícius, you score a goal out of this world, why do you celebrate like that and not like one of the best in the world, like Di Stéfano, Pelé, Eusébio... why don't you celebrate with the joy of scoring? It's always the same with him (Vini Jr.). It's what I can't understand (in my head).\"\n\nVini vents after reporting yet another case of racism: 'Still don't understand'\n\nMbappé comes to Vini's defense and details racism complaint\n\nMourinho ended up being sent off after complaining about the lack of a second yellow card for Vini for a foul on Richard Ríos.\n\n📸 PATRICIA DE MELO MOREIRA - AFP or licensors\n\nWithout the suspended Mourinho, Benfica will go to the Bernabéu next Wednesday (25th) with the mission of winning by two goals to advance in regular time.\n\nWhoever advances from this clash will face Sporting or Manchester City in the round of 16.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "fullText": "Rest of MLB should be scared of the latest Shohei Ohtani news for Dodgers originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nShohei Ohtani is already ahead of last year.\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers' two-way superstar is already the best baseball player on the planet, and maybe ever. He's already a two-time World Series champion in two seasons with the Dodgers, too.\n\nAnd now, another reason for baseball to be scared.\n\nTwo seasons ago, Ohtani didn't pitch at all for the Dodgers as he recovered from Tommy John surgery.\n\nLast season, Ohtani had to ramp up slowly as he worked back into pitching in MLB games again.\n\nThis time around, Ohtani is already throwing at spring training.\n\n\"To see him face hitters, kind of start his buildup -- he’s certainly way ahead of where he was last year on the pitching side. That’s a good thing,\" manager Dave Roberts said Tuesday, via MLB.com. \"But I just really don’t worry too much about his buildup and preparation.\"\n\nMORE: There's one question Pirates phenom Konnor Griffin needs to answer\n\nOhtani isn't going to be pitching for Samurai Japan during the World Baseball Classic.\n\nThat means he can ramp up some of his throwing before leaving for the WBC, then will have to try to do it again after the tournament, with likely only some on-the-side pitching while taking part in the event.\n\n\"Obviously, last year [he] was coming back from surgery, and so we were very deliberate about a lot of things,\" president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman said, via MLB.com. \"This year we will be less so, but still mindful of it. It's a heavy, heavy load that he takes on that is different from every other player in baseball. And so I think a lot of it is reading and reacting.\"\n\nOhtani is already an MVP-level player in every way. If he's actually at full strength all season long for the Dodgers on both sides of the baseball, he's that much tougher for the rest of the baseball world to deal with.\n\nTeam USA has a finalized WBC roster and an awesome lineup\n\nDominican Republic WBC roster is loaded with stars\n\nAn Edwin Diaz nightmare looms for the Mets\n\nBuster Posey will change Hall of Fame voting forever\n\nHow Jose Ramirez is on pace to become Cleveland's Derek Jeter\n\nYankees have signed a catcher from the country of Hungary",

    "fullText": "Reactions from the first day and weekend of Division-1 baseball can stick in the minds of scouts throughout the entirety of the spring. One singular game of 55 can be a mental staple despite the reality that it has no more important than the next game.\n\nIn this edition of The Sporting Tribune's bi-weekly draft notebook, we take a look at the most notable performances from the opening weekend of Divison-1 baseball, and what we saw over the weekend. Things that may stick with us through the entirety of the spring.\n\nUtah Tech 2B Kyle McDaniel reached base 11(!) times in three games to start the weekend (7-10, 4 BB); super unorthodox but feel to make contact is evident pic.twitter.com/ml7IFQtqIa\n\n— Taylor Blake Ward (@TaylorBlakeWard) February 15, 2026\n\nOne of the better hitters in the Western Athletic Conference (WAC), McDaniel proved his hitting prowess with one of the better early season performances against UC Riverside. Over four games against the Highlanders, he reached base safely in 15-of-21 plate appearances with zero strikeouts (8-for-14, six walks, one hit-by-pitch, double).\n\nWith an unorthodox setup and slap-and-dash swing from the left side and limited defensive versatility at second base, McDaniel may not jump to the top of boards through the spring, but his track record of hitting will propel him into early second day talk with a projected draft stock of rounds 4-7.\n\nSeen as one of the top pitchers in the 2026 draft class, Flora had one of the loudest performances across all of D1 on Friday when he ended the first inning with a 100-mph fastball with 21 inches of induced vertical break -- an uncommon shape for a fastball with that type of velocity.\n\nFlora struck out five Southern Miss hitters over six scoreless innings with no walks, three hits allowed and three batters hit. While the triple-digit moment was the standout moment, Flora held upper 90's velocity throughout the outing. Paired with his strike-throwing and pair of off-speed offering (sweeper, changeup) that both flash plus, he looks poised to be one of the top arms off the board come July -- if not the top arm in the class.\n\nMason Edwards strikes out the order, brings his total to 7 k’s in 4.0 innings across 65 pitches. pic.twitter.com/uNQDVwopyx\n\n— Anthony Arroyo (@AnthonyArroyo23) February 14, 2026\n\nUSC left-handed pitcher Mason Edwards made a strong statement as the Trojans’ Friday night starter. He struck out nine of the 15 batters he faced across five scoreless innings, allowing just one hit and two walks on an efficient 78 pitches.\n\nEdwin So - The Sporting Tribune\n\nUSC Trojan pitcher Mason Edwards (30) throws a pitch during an NCAA Men's baseball game between the USC Trojans and Pepperdine Wave Friday February 13,2026 at Dedeaux Field in Los Angeles Calif\n\nEdwards’ fastball sat 92–93 mph and topped out at 94, a slight dip from earlier reports, but he showed excellent command of the pitch throughout the outing. His slurve was particularly effective, generating the majority of his strikeouts and keeping hitters off balance.\n\nMason Edwards continuing to show good command with his SLV, gets third strikeout using his fastball, still sitting at 92-93, topping out at 94 in the 2nd inning across 40 pitches. pic.twitter.com/tI029inAeY\n\n— Anthony Arroyo (@AnthonyArroyo23) February 14, 2026\n\nWith South Carolina left-hander Jake McCoy sidelined due to a preseason arm injury, Edwards has positioned himself as a potential frontrunner to be the top college left-hander in the 2026 draft class, especially if his velocity ticks back up over his next few starts.\n\nUSC infielder Adrian Lopez had a strong Opening Day performance, going 1-for-2 with a double and a walk. He displayed solid plate discipline, consistently avoiding chase pitches and showing mature swing decisions throughout his at-bats.\n\nAdrian Lopez, in his 2nd AB double off the wall. pic.twitter.com/Z9N3SjxdRk\n\n— Anthony Arroyo (@AnthonyArroyo23) February 14, 2026\n\nLopez made the start at third base after playing first base for the Trojans last season. Defensively, he demonstrated a quick first step and good reactions on most balls hit his way, though his arm strength appeared average.\n\nAdrian Lopez at 3rd base, looking good with the with some grabs so far. Walked in his first at bat. pic.twitter.com/xS01QS9XAh\n\n— Anthony Arroyo (@AnthonyArroyo23) February 14, 2026\n\nOver the weekend, Lopez finished 2-for-9 with two doubles, two walks, and a hit-by-pitch, and one fielding error.\n\nStanding out as one of the best starting pitchers in the Western Athletic Conference, the senior's season debut was cut short after 2.2 inning when he exited the game due to some discomfort, which head coach Gary Adcock said was nothing serious, but also not worth pushing through so early in the season.\n\nSteven Park - The Sporting Tribune\n\nCBU Lancers pitcher Cody New (21) pitches during an NCAA Baseball game against the CSUF Titans on February 13, 2026 in Fullerton, California.\n\nNew struck out three Cal State Fullerton batters while allowing three hits and two walks.  New's four-seem sits around 93-94 MPH and he struggles to locate it at the top of the zone. His real standout pitches are his curveball and slider.\n\nCal Baptist LHP Cody New allowed three hits and two walks in 2.2 IP against CSUF with three K’s\n\nFB sat around 93-94 MPH and his curve between 77-80. Struggled with command at times, but his curveball has elite movement, esp. against RHH.\n\n⁦⁦⁦@TaylorBlakeWard⁩ pic.twitter.com/g02GMxirFQ\n\n— Jack Haslett (@JackHaslett_13) February 14, 2026\n\nNew's slider sits around 80 MPH and also has wicked movement that makes it unreachable for most right handed batters, while his curve ranges between 77-81 MPH, with great lateral movement and drop to elicit swings-and-misses and generate the majority of his strikeouts.\n\nSteven Park - The Sporting Tribune\n\nCSUF Titans pitcher Mikiah Negrete (4) pitches during an NCAA Baseball game against the CBU Lancers on February 13, 2026 in Fullerton, California.\n\nThe Titan's senior ace started the season strong against Cal Baptist by striking out four while allowing three hits in 5.0 innings of work.\n\nNegrete's fastball hovers in the low 90's but he shows impressive command with both his curveball, which sits around 83 MPH and features effective vertical drop, and his changeup that sits right at 80 MPH. The changeup looks to be Negrete's bread and butter pitch, using it well to break up sequences in an admittedly limited pitch arsenal and disrupt opposing batter's timing.\n\nMikiah Negrete allowed three hits and struck out four in 5.0 innings for the Titans.\n\nFastball sat around 89-90 MPH. His curveball touched 83 and his changeup right at 80.\n\nChangeup looks to be the SO pitch for the senior. Mixed up his sequences well. @TaylorBlakeWard pic.twitter.com/JlMoqSM4pT\n\n— Jack Haslett (@JackHaslett_13) February 14, 2026\n\nJessica Cryderman - The Sporting Tribune\n\nUCLA infielder, Roch Cholowsky (1) at bat, mid hit during a NCAA baseball game against UC San Diego on February 13, 2026 at Jackie Robinson Stadium in Los Angeles, CA.\n\nOne of the most highly anticipated debuts of the season on Friday night was UCLA junior shortstop Roch Cholowsky against UCLA San Diego.\n\nViewed as a potential No.1 pick for this year's draft, and with player comps such as Troy Tulowitzki and Carlos Correa, Cholowsky did not disappoint.\n\nAt the plate, Cholowsky went 1-4 with his lone hit coming in the 8th inning, blasting a double towards left field, which was just a foot shy of being a home run. The only other time he reached base was in the third inning when he reached on a fielder's choice. Despite having one hit, he showed tremendous patience at the plate, working the count all the way to the top, and had a walk in the fourth inning.\n\nRoch Cholowsky has shown a lot of patience tonight and just had his first walk of the evening on a 6 pitch at bat. Still\nLooking for that first single tonight. pic.twitter.com/fEIyRITyjr\n\n— Thomas Murray (@Thomas_L_Murray) February 14, 2026\n\nAcross the diamond, he showed tremendous speed and athleticism while playing defense. One of his most impressive plays at shortstop came on a blooper that was hit towards left-center field. Cholowsky sprinted back and robbed UC San Diego of a single.\n\nRoch Cholowsky tracks this ball out to left field and makes a sliding catch for the second out of the 4th inning. @TaylorBlakeWard pic.twitter.com/Q4Xems3HFC\n\n— Thomas Murray (@Thomas_L_Murray) February 14, 2026\n\nJessica Cryderman - The Sporting Tribune\n\nUCLA pitcher, Logan Reddemann (24) pitching during a NCAA baseball game against UC San Diego on February 13, 2026 at Jackie Robinson Stadium in Los Angeles, CA.\n\nJunior UCLA right-handed pitcher Logan Reddemann showed why he deserved to be UCLA's Friday night pitcher by showing fight and keeping the Bruins in the ballgame.\n\nAfter struggling early on with command issues and giving up 3 runs by the third inning, Reddemann had a bounce-back 4th and 5th inning for UCLA by retiring six straight batters and striking out 3 of them. Reddemann finished the game, throwing 89 pitches, striking out 6 batters, while giving up 3 runs, 5 hits, and 2 walks.\n\nHis fastball was impressive during the night, tracking at 95-97 MPH, through five innings, while his breaking ball was around 84 MPH, and offspeed was at 78-79 MPH.\n\nUCLA RHP Logan Reddeman’s night came to an end, had a bounce back performance struggling with command issues to strikeout 6 batters, throwing around 95-97, 84 on breaking balls and 78 on changeups. pic.twitter.com/o5IAjbQpsw\n\n— Thomas Murray (@Thomas_L_Murray) February 14, 2026\n\nJessica Cryderman - The Sporting Tribune\n\nUCLA infielder, Roman Martin (7), at bat, mid-hit during a NCAA baseball game against UC San Diego on February 13, 2026 at Jackie Robinson Stadium in Los Angeles, CA.\n\nJunior UCLA third baseman Roman Martin possibly showed the best patience at the plate during the night, earning himself 2 walks, including one in the third inning with the bases loaded.\n\nA prime opportunity to swing the bat, Martin sat at the plate with a 3-1 count and was looking to do damage against UCSD. Triton pitcher Steele Murdock was on the mound against Martin and threw a fastball that went outside the strike zone, giving the Bruins their first run of the game.\n\nMartin, once considered a top prospect in high school, showed why he could be drafted in the 2nd-3rd round of this year's draft, finishing the game going 1-3, with 2 RBIs and a single in the second inning.\n\nUCLA 3B Roman Martin who can also play SS opens the second inning tonight with single to get the Bruins offense going. pic.twitter.com/YOUhGhRQ28\n\n— Thomas Murray (@Thomas_L_Murray) February 14, 2026\n\nJessica Cryderman - The Sporting Tribune\n\nUCLA Mulivai Levu (39) at bat, mid hit during a NCAA baseball game against UC San Diego on February 13, 2026 at Jackie Robinson Stadium in Los Angeles, CA.\n\nConsidered one of the top hitting prospects out of this year's draft, Junior UCLA firstbaseman Mulivai Levu had 1 RBI and scored two runs despite not notching a hit.\n\nLevu's single RBI was in the fourth inning, when he reached base on a fielder's choice. Despite not having a single hit in the game, he showed great patience at the plate, working the count and finishing with two walks.\n\nSteele Murdock gets Will Gasparino down on strikes for his first punch out of the season pic.twitter.com/ygmNdESSMc\n\n— Thomas Murray (@Thomas_L_Murray) February 14, 2026\n\nRedshirt Sophomore, RHP, Steele Murdock had a promising start to the game, retiring the first three batters he faced, and getting out of an early jam after giving up a single to Martin and letting him reach second on a wild pitch.\n\nMurdock retaliated in the second by striking out Will Gasparino and not giving up a run to the next four batters he faced.\n\nBut in the third, Murdock suffered command issues and walked three batters and gave up one single while Cholowsky reached on a fielder's choice.\n\nMurdock attempted to pitch to Payton Brennan but was removed from the game mid-at-bat after giving up two balls. Murdock finished the game, giving up 3 runs, 4 walks, 2 hits, while striking out 1 batter in 2 1/3 innings.\n\nMurdock's fastball consistently sat at around 92-93 MPH, with his breaking ball hitting 81, and his offspeed was at 76 MPH.",

    "fullText": "Todd McShay said the uncomfortable thing out loud about Diego Pavia originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nNFL Draft projections are difficult and certainly more science than art. However, throughout the draft season, many analysts must be the bearer of bad news. Sometimes it’s legitimate and sometimes it's over analyzing small details.\n\nIn the case of Diego Pavia, Todd McShay has delivered a take publicly that many already believed to be true. Pavia does not have an NFL quarterback skill set.\n\nThe important thing to remember is winning games or being exciting, does not necessarily relate to an NFL quarterback skill set nor is it an indicator of future NFL success. The most direct comp that explains this concept is that Diego Pavia is the anti-Tim Tebow.\n\nPavia, like Tebow, plays with a ton of grit and determination. He has moxie in spades. He is a gamer and can be incredible working off platform. However, none of those descriptors feeds directly into what NFL General Managers are looking for.\n\nAlso, like Tebow, pocket presence and discipline, elite arm talent, command of the offense, a willingness to win within structure and an instinctive ability to put the ball where it needs to be, are not aspects that describe Pavia.\n\nMcShay is a respected analyst that doesn’t pick favorites unless the game tape dictates this over that. While McShay’s take is not divine football mandate, it does carry some weight. Recently, McShay articulated a growing concern with Pavia.\n\n“I don’t know if Diego Pavia can play quarterback in the NFL. You watch him during the team sessions and 7-on-7s and there’s some fun things to watch, man,” McShay Said. “He just has unbelievable instincts. But when you watch him in 1-on-1s, having to drive the ball, make NFL throws, it's not the same as the other guys.”\n\nThat is the issue in a nutshell. Pavia is small, not particularly fast on the move, does some creative things, but lacks the skill set NFL teams are looking for.\n\n“It’s not like he did it in the WAC or FCS. He did it in the SEC. So it’s hard to say definitively that this guy can’t play in the NFL. I’m not saying that. I’m saying when you watch him out ther, you start to wonder, are the limitations going to be too much in the NFL?”\n\nOnce the pre Draft process gets into he weeds so to speak around March and April, another growing concept will take shape. Success in the college football wins and losses metric does not necessarily equal high draft pick.\n\nAn interesting corollary is Shedeur Sanders.  Not in play style, but in narratives. In 2024 Sanders put up a stat line of 74% completion percentage, almost 4,200 yards and 37 touchdowns to 10 interceptions. In 2025 Pavia put up a stat line of 70% completion percentage, almost 3,600 yards and 29 touchdowns to eight interceptions.\n\nDespite his on-field numbers there was enough that NFL front offices didn't like about Sanders, likely off the field, that he was drafted No. 144 in the 5th round. The largest divider between Sanders and Pavia is style of play. Sanders is a pocket passer who by and large, works within the framework of the offense. Yet it could be more of what was said and done during the pre-Draft process that impacted Sanders' stock the most.\n\nPavia started off the pre-Draft process poorly. When head coach Clark Lea attempted to schedule an additional game to improve Vanderbilt’s playoff chances, that was supported by Pavia. Later, Pavia would reach out via Twitter asking for legislative help from the President of the United States. Both moves were not received well.\n\nThe Heisman Trophy presentation offered two issues of concern. The first of which was simply confirmation of a commonly held idea. Pavia is strikingly small. The second of which might be more concerning. When Pavia did not win the Heisman, he went scorched earth mode. Criticizing Heisman voters and casting a shadow over the entire proceedings.\n\nMore:Nebraska finally admits Big Ten hasn't worked and wanted out\n\nPavia’s Senior Bowl performance was not good. Many media outlets celebrated his success at the Senior Bowl, due in large part to a sentiment from practice. Pavia was voted by his Senior Bowl teammates as one of the better practice players.\n\nHowever, the positive practices and vote of confidence from his teammates did not translate to the game. Pavia’s size, footwork as well as his passing technique and delivery were all some varying degree of not good.\n\nAs the pre-Draft process continues with the Scouting Combine and the Vanderbilt pro day still to be performed, more clarity would come to light on Pavia’s draft stock. However, in the early going, it is not looking promising for Pavia’s long term NFL success.\n\nMore:Diego Pavia's Senior Bowl game tape tells a different story\n\nThe Vanderbilt quarterback has said since the season ended that he was the best player in the 2026 NFL Draft. It will take more than soundbites to convince NFL front offices to take a chance on him. If he can’t convince teams of that, his draft stock might be less than Sanders’ was. Putting him deep in Day 3, if drafted at all.\n\nOregon's Dan Lanning rips College Football Playoff, calls for major changes\n\nDeion Sanders buyout, contract details as Colorado Buffaloes coach\n\nFormer Colorado All-American blasts Deion Sanders and son\n\nDabo Swinney fires Clemson coaches immediately after loss to Penn State\n\nOhio State's Ryan Day faces backlash after Cotton Bowl",

    "fullText": "There seems to be some confusion at the moment regarding the rules of fighting in hockey at the Olympic Winter Games. On Sunday in the game between Canada and France, Pierre Crinon of France fought Tom Wilson of Canada.\n\nThis was the first Olympic hockey fight since 1998 according to the Rogers Sportsnet, and there was a belief by many that there would be supplementary discipline. Then the International Ice Hockey Federation made the surprise announcement that there would be no more further discipline against Crinon and Wilson, as they both received game misconducts for their fights.\n\nMany who are part of the hockey world have always been of the understanding that fighting was simply not part of Olympic hockey. What happens when there actually is a fight?\n\nIn what we found out, players are not banned from the tournament, they are just banned from one particular game.\n\nThe president of the French Ice Hockey Federation, Pierre-Yves Gerbeau, was very dissatisfied with the fight. According to Luke Fox of Sportsnet, Gerbeau believed Crinon’s behaviour was “provocative” and stated the following about his participation in the fight:\n\n“(It was) a clear violation of the Olympic spirit and also undermines the values of our sport.”\n\nOne needs to realize that France has a history of emphasizing the importance that the athletes prioritize the Olympic Spirit. That is because the founder of the International Olympic Committee was Pierre de Coubertin of France, who established the Olympic Oath.\n\nPrior to the start of the Olympic tournament, many including me, were surprised that Wilson made Team Canada at all because of his lack of discipline throughout his hockey career. He has been suspended on multiple occasions.\n\nWilson has 1610 penalty minutes in 885 games. There is a belief he made Team Canada to generate energy throughout the lineup, and is lucky that he was not suspended by the powers that be either.\n\nOLYMPICS: 2026 Winter Olympics medal count, standings entering February 16\n\nNFL Draft: 3 shocking 2026 NFL Combine snubs, full list of prospects attending\n\nNFL: Tennessee Titans’ new logo leaked in Fanatics mishap?\n\nENTERTAINMENT: Logan Paul’s Pikachu Illustrator sale price sets Guinness World Record\n\nNEWS: Nancy Guthrie kidnapping case reportedly gets DNA breakthrough\n\nVIRAL: Chloe Kim ‘obsessed’ with $100k gift from NFL star Myles Garrett after Olympics\n\nThe post French Hockey suspends Pierre Crinon for fighting Tom Wilson appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "Could the Denver Broncos make this happen?",
    "fullText": "Broncos' 'dream' trade scenario could be more available than ever originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAs the 2026 NFL offseason begins to take shape, the Denver Broncos will be peppered with questions concerning how they choose to address upgrading the offense. Though the team went 14-3 in 2025, it seems obvious that they need more playmakers.\n\nThe team needs a productive, game-changing player at the wide receiver position. The Broncos have lacked that for years. Options such as A.J. Brown, Tyreek Hill George Pickens are going to be discussed, but a team already going through major changes this offseason may have the answer in a player the Broncos took a look at last year.\n\nThe Miami Dolphins have already parted ways with Hill, Bradley Chubb and Nick Westbrook-Ikhine in an effort to create more room under the salary cap and begin to overhaul their roster. You might remember ahead of the trade deadline this past season when reports came out that the Broncos were interested in Dolphins receiver Jaylen Waddle.\n\nAt the time, it was reported that the Dolphins were asking for too much in return. However, could that option be more available now with the Dolphins turning the roster over?\n\nMoe Moton of Bleacher Report suggests that this is the dream trade scenario for the Broncos this offseason. Here were his thoughts:\n\n\"This is a long-shot dream scenario, but not far-fetched given the Miami Dolphins' roster turnover on Monday.\n\nThe Dolphins have a new general manager and coaching staff that may continue to tear down the roster in a full-blown rebuild. Jaylen Waddle has a tradeable contract that only counts $11.6 million against the salary cap.\n\nThe Denver Broncos may have to overpay in draft compensation to acquire Waddle, but it may be worth it while in a Super Bowl window.\n\nThe Broncos need more big plays in the passing game. Courtland Sutton averaged 13.7 yards per catch, but Troy Franklin, Marvin Mims Jr., and Evan Engram all averaged fewer than 11 yards per grab. As a rookie, Pat Bryant averaged 12.2 yards per reception, but he struggled to stay healthy late in the season.\n\nIn 2025, Waddle played through injuries. He only missed one game and racked up 14.2 yards per reception. The 27-year-old doesn't have the accolades of a premier wideout, but his playmaking ability would move the needle for Denver's aerial attack.\n\nRemember, according to NFL insider Jordan Schultz, the Broncos \"reached out\" to the Dolphins about Waddle's availability before the 2025 trade deadline.\"\n\nThis is a move that makes sense, even if it doesn't bring the Broncos that \"superstar\" that so many feel they need.\n\nWaddle is still one of the fastest wide receivers in the league and he could threaten defenses deep down the field, allowing things to open up more for Bo Nix and the offensive attack. The big question would be, do the Dolphins want to move on from Hill and Waddle in the same offseason?\n\nMORE:Broncos have to be out on Breece Hall if Jets make predicted move\n\nFor a team that will almost certainly have a new starting quarterback in 2026, it seems that keeping at least one proven option on the roster is a good idea. Still, it wouldn't hurt for George Paton to place a phone call and see what that price tag looks like now.\n\nBroncos not named as potential landing spot for Tyreek Hill following Dolphins release\n\nBroncos may be getting an idea of cost for A.J. Brown as two more predictions send him to Denver\n\nBroncos predicted to take major step back in 2026 despite near Super Bowl run\n\nRanking Denver Broncos' in-house free agents\n\nFormer Broncos head coach lands new job: Tracking where former coaches will be in 2026",

    "fullText": "José Mourinho addressed the racist abuse involving Vinícius Júnior during Benfica’s Champions League match against Real Madrid on Tuesday night at the Estádio da Luz.\n\nReal Madrid won the match 1–0, with Vinícius scoring the decisive goal. In the second half, play was stopped for around 10 minutes after Vinícius reported comments made by Benfica player Gianluca Prestianni. The referee activated the anti-racism protocol before the match eventually resumed.\n\nSpeaking after the match, Mourinho said he did not want to take sides between the two players but suggested Vinícius’ celebration contributed to the situation.\n\n“I told him [Vinicius] – when you score a goal like that, you just celebrate and walk back,” Mourinho said.\n\n“His talents allow him to do these beautiful things, but unfortunately, he was not just happy to score that astonishing goal. When you score a goal like that, you celebrate in a respectful way.”\n\nMourinho also defended Benfica as a club, pointing to its history and identity.\n\n“When he was arguing about racism, I told him the biggest person [Eusebio] in the history of this club was Black,” Mourinho said.\n\n“This club, the last thing that it is, is racist. If in his mind there was something in relation to that – this in Benfica. They [Vinicius and Prestianni] told me different things. But I don’t believe in one or another. I want to be an independent.”\n\nMourinho added that incidents involving Vinícius have occurred in multiple stadiums.\n\n“There is something wrong because it happens in every stadium,” Mourinho said. “A stadium where Vinicius plays something happens, always.”\n\nThe incident remains under discussion following the match, with Vinícius having already spoken publicly about the situation in a social media statement earlier in the evening.\n\nReal Madrid’s win in Lisbon secured an important Champions League result, though the match was overshadowed by the abhorrent events.",

    "title": "Why an A.I. Video of Tom Cruise Battling Brad Pitt Spooked Hollywood",
    "description": "A 15-second clip created by an artificial intelligence tool owned by the Chinese technology company ByteDance appears more cinematic than anything so far.",
    "fullText": "It took only a 15-second clip of Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt duking it out on a crumbling rooftop at twilight to draw swift outrage, and sizable fear, from Hollywood over the last few days.\n\nThe widely circulated video was created by the Irish director Ruairi Robinson using Seedance 2.0, a powerful artificial intelligence video generation tool owned by the Chinese technology company ByteDance. It had plenty of the bells and whistles of a big-budget Hollywood film: sweeping camera angles, stunt choreography, crisp sound effects and haunting music.\n\nWith a two-sentence prompt and the click of a button, Seedance had produced a stunningly realistic result that was a drastic improvement over previously generated artificial intelligence videos, often shoddy clips known as A.I. slop. This video was so convincing that it drew near immediate condemnation from some of Hollywood’s top organizations and companies.\n\nRhett Reese, a scriptwriter known for his “Deadpool” films, said in an interview that the Cruise-Pitt video had sent a “cold shiver” up his spine.\n\n“For all of us who work in the industry and devoted our careers and lives to it, I just think it’s nothing short of terrifying,” he said. “I could just see it costing jobs all over the place.”\n\nByteDance released Seedance 2.0 last week, nearly two months after a previous version had failed to prompt much anger. A news release from the company praised the updated tool’s “physical accuracy, realism and controllability,” which it said was suitable for the needs of “professional-grade creative scenarios.”\n\n“The creation process,” the release went on, “is more natural and efficient, allowing users to control their creations like a true ‘director.’”\n\nUsers promptly flocked to the platform to spin up their own content. An alternate ending to “Game of Thrones” went viral, as did a video of the notoriously beefing rappers Kendrick Lamar and Drake burying the hatchet on “The Tonight Show,” and one of Samara Morgan, the vengeful girl in “The Ring” horror films, emerging from an old television set to pet a cat.\n\nRobinson himself posted additional videos, including of Pitt and Cruise battling a robot, and of Pitt sparring with a sword-wielding “zombie ninja.”\n\nAt the same time, Hollywood was swift to sit up straight. Charles Rivkin, the chairman and chief executive of the Motion Picture Association, called on ByteDance to “immediately cease its infringing activity,” saying in a statement that Seedance 2.0 had engaged in the unauthorized use of copyrighted works on a “massive scale.” Human Artistry Campaign, a global coalition that advocates using A.I. “with respect for the irreplaceable artists, performers and creatives,” said on social media that unauthorized works generated by Seedance 2.0 violated the “most basic aspects of personal autonomy.”\n\nDisney, which in a watershed $1 billion deal last year agreed to allow OpenAI’s Sora users to generate video content with its characters, sent a cease-and-desist letter to ByteDance, accusing it of supplying Seedance with a “pirated library” of Disney’s characters — “as if Disney’s coveted intellectual property were free public-domain clip art.”\n\nByteDance, which also owns TikTok and has been valued at $480 billion in the private markets, said in a statement that it respected intellectual property rights and was aware of the concerns about Seedance.\n\n“We are taking steps to strengthen current safeguards as we work to prevent the unauthorized use of intellectual property and likeness by users,” the statement said.\n\nAs last year’s deal between Disney and OpenAI suggests, Hollywood has for years wrestled with how to manage the rapid growth of generative artificial intelligence. The concerns outlined by Reese echoed the Writers Guild strike in 2023, when for months thousands of union members demanded that studios institute guardrails protecting them from having their jobs or their intellectual property stolen by A.I. In the end, the group won guarantees that A.I. would not encroach on writers’ credits and compensation.\n\nDuncan Crabtree-Ireland, the national executive director and chief negotiator of SAG-AFTRA, which represents actors and media artists, said its contracts had specific and enforceable rules about digital replication. The kind of material represented by the Cruise-Pitt battle, he said, “could not be produced by any of the signatories to our contracts — the studios, the streamers — without the specific, informed consent of those individuals.”\n\nAccording to Crabtree-Ireland, the real concern is that, even if videos generated by Seedance and other A.I. platforms “are not malicious in intent,” they could “really violate someone’s right to control how their image, their likeness and their voice is used.”\n\nNot everyone is awed by Seedance’s latest technology. Heather Anne Campbell, an executive producer and a writer on the animated series “Rick and Morty,” said her social media accounts last week had been inundated with Seedance-generated clips of anime, sci-fi and unlikely superhero battles. But she is not yet worried, she said, about losing her job to the technology.\n\n“Everybody is, I think, swept up by the circus that came to town and is showing off,” she said. “I haven’t seen anything good yet. Nothing that has taken my breath away, nothing that is poignant, nothing that is provocative even. It’s all just garbage.”\n\nCampbell added that A.I. services like Seedance were at best “averaging machines,” and argued that the greatest art was never made quickly or impersonally.\n\nStill, some people working in Hollywood find it difficult to imagine that studios will not come to see A.I. as a cost-saving shortcut. “It would be cheaper to have A.I. write a screenplay than it would be for me to write a screenplay,” Reese, the “Deadpool” writer, said. “I just know that in the back of my mind, that’s where the terror comes from.”\n\nFor Reese, a long-term answer to the unease that A.I. will reorder Hollywood could not come quickly enough.\n\n“If I could wave my magic wand and make A.I. go away, at least in the creative field,” he said, “I would absolutely wave the wand.”",

    "description": "He exposed abuses in films like “Titicut Follies,” a once-banned portrait of a mental hospital, but ranged widely in subject matter, from a Queens neighborhood to a French restaurant.",
    "fullText": "Frederick Wiseman, a director whose rigorously objective explorations of social and cultural institutions constitute one of the more revered bodies of work in American documentary filmmaking, died on Monday at his home in Cambridge, Mass. He was 96.\n\nHis family announced the death through Zipporah Films, the distribution company he founded in 1971.\n\nMr. Wiseman, who received an honorary Academy Award in 2016, was among the most influential directors of nonfiction cinema.\n\nHe consistently dismissed categorizations of his work. “I like to call them films” rather than documentaries, he said, because he found the word “documentary” limiting. But he was as closely associated as anyone with the vérité documentary.\n\nAnd though he denied that his movies had any political agenda, he was no stranger to controversy. His directorial debut, “Titicut Follies” (1967), a harrowing portrait of the Bridgewater State Hospital for the criminally insane in Massachusetts, remains the only film ever banned in the United States for reasons other than obscenity, immorality or national security. (The ban, imposed by Massachusetts on the grounds that the film violated the inmates’ privacy, was lifted in 1991; the film subsequently aired on PBS.)\n\nMr. Wiseman’s last films were among his best received. The novelist Jay Neugeboren, writing in The New York Review of Books, called “In Jackson Heights” (2015), a panoramic portrait of one of the country’s most diverse neighborhoods, in Queens, the “most richly textured and sumptuously beautiful” of Wiseman’s documentaries. Reviewing “Ex Libris: The New York Public Library” (2017) for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis called it “one of the greatest movies of Mr. Wiseman’s extraordinary career and one of his most thrilling.”\n\nSince then, Mr. Wiseman had released “Monrovia, Indiana” (2018), a study of small-town Middle America; the long-in-the-works “City Hall” (2020), a four-and-a-half-hour examination of urban bureaucracy set in Boston, his hometown; and “Menus-Plaisirs — Les Troisgros” (2023), a loving four-hour dissection of a three-Michelin-star French restaurant and the family that runs it.\n\n“Titicut Follies” became the stylistic template for Mr. Wiseman’s subsequent films, which were free of narration and shot with available light, and which often concerned public institutions and the abuses therein. Among his better-known works are “High School” (1968), “Welfare” (1975), “Public Housing” (1997) and “Domestic Violence” (2002).\n\nUncovering governmental or administrative malfeasance, however, was never his aim.\n\n“There’s a common assumption that my movies are exposés,” Mr. Wiseman said in a 2011 interview for this obituary, “and I don’t think they are. You can certainly argue that a movie like ‘Titicut Follies’ is in part an exposé, but you couldn’t make a movie about Bridgewater without showing how horrible it was.”\n\nHe added: “There are people who think if I don’t make a movie about how poor people are being taken advantage of by the system, it’s not a real Fred Wiseman movie. And I think that shows a complete misunderstanding about what I’m doing.”\n\nMr. Wiseman was born on New Year’s Day 1930 in Boston. His father, Jacob, was a lawyer whose work involved helping Jewish émigrés escape an increasingly antisemitic Europe. His mother, Gertrude, had aspired to be an actress, only to have her dream thwarted by her father. Mr. Wiseman’s interest in theater was kindled by his mother’s uncanny talent as a mimic.\n\nThe other reason for his attending Yale was the Korean War draft. “Even law school seemed to be, to my keen analytical mind, a better alternative than going to war,” Mr. Wiseman wrote.\n\nLaw school resulted, however obliquely, in Mr. Wiseman’s career as a documentarian. Upon leaving Yale in 1954 he was drafted anyway. He became a clerk typist, was trained as a court reporter at the University of Virginia and was assigned to the judge advocate general’s office at Fort Benning, Ga. Looking to take advantage of an Army regulation that allowed early discharge to soldiers who planned to attend school, he applied and was admitted to the Sorbonne, and studied law in Paris on the G.I. Bill.\n\nThis was followed by a position at Boston University School of Law, where Mr. Wiseman taught subjects he later claimed to know little about: legal writing, legal medicine, family law and copyright. To compensate for his lack of expertise, he recalled, he would take students on field trips to places “where defendants would end up if they were poorly represented or overzealously prosecuted.” One of those places was the Bridgewater hospital.\n\nMr. Wiseman’s one brush with filmmaking before “Titicut Follies” was as the producer of “The Cool World” (1963), a drama directed by Shirley Clarke and adapted from a Warren Miller novel of the same name that Mr. Wiseman liked so much that he acquired the rights. The experience of producing that movie, he later said, persuaded him to direct and edit his own films.\n\nHis relationship with the superintendent at Bridgewater, which he had visited frequently with students, opened the doors to the making of “Titicut Follies.” (“Titicut” is a Native American word that refers to the nearby Taunton River.) This set him on the path to making several dozen other documentaries, most of which take an unblinking, aesthetically spare look at unlit corners of American life.\n\nAlthough his subject matter was almost always American, he occasionally ventured abroad to tackle subjects that were, in his words, “not possible in America,” in films like “La Comédie-Française ou L’Amour Joué” (1996), “La Danse: The Paris Opera Ballet” (2009) and “Crazy Horse” (2011), about the erotic nightclub of the same name in Paris.\n\n“I don’t know if I can offer a general definition of what I’m doing,” Mr. Wiseman said in 2011, “except to say I’m trying to create dramatic structures out of ordinary experience, under a variety of differing circumstances, so the cumulative effect will be a series of thematically interrelated films that record how people thought and lived and worked over the course of time that I made the movies. And how that behavior is in part reflected in institutions. And how institutions are to a certain extent microcosms for a larger society.\n\n“I try to avoid definitions or theories,” he continued. “That’s a sort of general statement, which I don’t particularly like having made. But I just made it.”\n\nMr. Wiseman’s approach to his films — shot in what he wryly referred to as “wobblyscope,” thanks to his hand-held camera — was perhaps never better expressed than during a face-off with his fellow documentarian Werner Herzog, onstage at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival.\n\nMr. Herzog, who had been espousing a theory of “ecstatic truth” and a willingness to manipulate his nonfiction films to achieve something sublime, confided to the audience that a shot apparently made through a dewdrop in his film “The White Diamond” had actually been made through a leaf to which glycerin had been applied. Asked whether he had ever done anything similar, or would, Mr. Wiseman said he had not, but admitted that he might change a lightbulb if a room seemed too dark.\n\nChanging his films was another story. Likening him to Howard Roark, the hero of Ayn Rand’s novel “The Fountainhead,” the filmmaker Errol Morris, a fan of Mr. Wiseman’s work, said Mr. Wiseman “would rather blow up the building he designed than remove a doorknob.” The result, over the years, has included films of virtually unparalleled length — his 1989 film “Near Death,” set in a Boston hospital, is nearly six hours long — and a consequent lack of commercial viability.\n\n“You’d think it would be easy for me to raise money because I’ve made a lot of movies,” Mr. Wiseman said. “But it’s not.”\n\nThe only time filmmaking was not a financial struggle for him was from 1971 to 1981, when he had two five-year contracts with WNET, the New York public television station, arranged by Fred W. Friendly, then with the Ford Foundation.\n\n“That was nirvana,” Mr. Wiseman recalled, “because I knew I could just go from film to film without stopping to raise money. WNET certainly had to approve the subject matter. But they never disapproved of the subject matter.”\n\nHe added, “The cliché about political pressure, as far as I’m concerned, is a nonissue.” With the exception of “Titicut Follies,” the only Wiseman film that became a subject of contention was “The Garden,” his 2004 movie about Madison Square Garden, which remains unreleased.\n\n“They brought suit,” he said of the Garden’s owners, “and I countersued. But the reason the film hasn’t been shown hasn’t to do with the Garden; we worked out our differences. The reason the film hasn’t been seen is over whether I could get permission to use some of the music, complicated by the fact that originally it was my assumption that the Garden had made all of those arrangements. Someday it will be.”\n\nMr. Wiseman is survived by his two sons, David and Eric, and three grandchildren. He met his wife, Zipporah Batshaw Wiseman, at Yale in 1954, and they married in 1955. She died in 2021 after a distinguished legal career.\n\nIn addition to his honorary Academy Award, Mr. Wiseman received honors including a career achievement award from the Los Angeles Film Society in 2013 and the Golden Lion for lifetime achievement from the Venice Film Festival in 2014. He never won a competitive Oscar, but he won Emmy Awards for the documentaries “Law and Order” (1969) and “Hospital” (1970).\n\nAlthough Mr. Wiseman was a role model for generations of idealistic documentarians, his own view of the genre was the opposite of misty-eyed.\n\n“I don’t know what causes social change,” he said in 2011. “But I don’t think it is documentary filmmaking. It’s one thing to start out with a naïve belief or the pious wish that that would be the case, but it certainly is not the case, and it’s ultimately a naïve and presumptuous view.”\n\nMr. Wiseman edited virtually all his own films. “A fiction film has a script,” he said, “so at the very least the chronology is determined in advance. But a documentary film of the kind I make, it’s reversed: I write the script in the editing.”\n\nHe continued: “I’m not saying there aren’t choices in the editing in a fiction film, because of course there are. But the range of choices aren’t anywhere near as great as they are in a documentary.”\n\nIn “La Danse,” for example, he turned about 150 hours of raw footage into a film of 2 hours 45 minutes, so “the ratio of film shot to film used was about 50 to 1.”\n\nShooting so much, Mr. Wiseman said, was just a logical result of the nature of his artistic pursuit. “I am trying to harvest a crop,” he said, “which I have not planted, and which may not exist.”",

    "fullText": "SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Nvidia on Tuesday said it has signed a multiyear deal to sell Meta Platforms millions of its current ‌and future artificial intelligence chips, including central processing units that compete ‌with products from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nNvidia did not disclose a value for the deal, ​but said it includes its current Blackwell chips as well as its forthcoming Rubin AI chips. It also includes standalone installations of its Grace and Vera central processors.\n\nNvidia introduced those central processors, based on technology from Arm Holdings, as companions to its ‌AI chips starting 2023. ⁠But the announcement Tuesday signaled that Nvidia aims to push those chips for emerging fields such as running AI agents as ⁠well as into markets for processors used in workaday technical tasks such as running databases.\n\nNvidia's announcement also comes as Meta is developing its own AI chips and is in ​discussions with ​Google about using that company's Tensor Processing ​Unit chips, or TPUs, for ‌AI work.\n\nIan Buck, the general manager of Nvidia's hyperscale and high-performance computing unit, said that Nvidia's Grace central processors have shown they can use half the power for some common tasks such as running databases, with more gains expected for the next generation, Vera.\n\n\"It actually continues down that path and makes it an ‌excellent data center-only CPU for those high-intensity data ​processing back-end operations,\" Buck said. \"Meta has already had ​a chance to get on ​Vera and run some of those workloads. And the results ‌look very promising.\"\n\nWhile Nvidia has never disclosed ​its sales to ​Meta, it is widely believed to be among four customers that made up 61% of its revenue in its most recent fiscal quarter. Moorhead ​said Nvidia likely highlighted the ‌deal to show that it has retained a large business with ​Meta and is gaining traction with its central processor chips.",

    "fullText": "SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) — A Guatemalan driver fleeing a Georgia traffic stop by federal immigration officers crashed into another vehicle, killing a teacher who was headed to work, authorities and school officials said.\n\nOscar Vasquez Lopez, the driver accused of causing the Monday crash just outside of Savannah, remained jailed Tuesday on charges including vehicular homicide, reckless driving and driving without a valid license. Lopez, 38, is in the U.S. illegally, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nImmigration officers were looking for Lopez to enforce an immigration judge's 2024 deportation order, ICE spokesperson Lindsay Williams said Tuesday, noting that Lopez has no other criminal history.\n\nLopez pulled over when ICE officers used sirens and blue lights to initiate a traffic stop, but then drove away when they approached his vehicle, Williams said. Lopez made a U-turn and ran a stop light before he crashed, ICE said in a news release.\n\nAsked if the ICE officers chased Lopez, Williams said: “Chased? I wouldn't say that. They followed him until he crashed.”\n\nWilliams said he didn't know how far Lopez fled before he crashed.\n\n“According to preliminary findings, we believe the pursuit was relatively short in duration and distance,” said Chatham County police spokesperson Betsy Nolen, who noted the investigation is ongoing.\n\nSecurity camera video obtained by WTOC-TV showed a red pickup truck moving at high speed past Herman W. Hesse K-8 School on Monday morning. The footage showed a vehicle with flashing lights follow about five seconds later at a similar speed, and another vehicle with lights flashing pass several seconds after that.\n\nNews video from the crash scene showed one of the vehicles involved in the wreck was a red pickup.\n\nSavannah-Chatham County school officials identified the woman killed as Linda Davis, a special education teacher at the school.\n\nDavis was beloved by the school community, Principal Alonna McMullen said.\n\n“She dedicated her career to ensuring that every child felt supported, valued, and capable of success,\" McMullen said in a news release. \"Her kindness, patience, and enthusiasm created a nurturing environment for her students and inspired those around her.”\n\nThe crash happened less than a half-mile (0.8 kilometers) from the school. Though students were off Monday for Presidents Day, teachers reported to work. Davis was driving to school when she was killed, school system spokesperson Sheila Blanco said.\n\nLopez remained jailed Tuesday. He is being representing by a public defender in Chatham County, said Don Plummer, a spokesman for the Georgia Public Defender Council.\n\n“We recognize the community’s concern and extend condolences to those harmed,” Plummer said by email. “Mr. Lopez is presumed innocent. We will review the evidence and address it where it belongs — in court, not in the press.”\n\nFederal immigration officers have faced increased scrutiny for their aggressive tactics during the Trump administration's nationwide crackdown on illegal immigration, especially since they shot and killed Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.\n\nIn a statement, Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, blamed “politicians and the media constantly demonizing ICE officers and encouraging those here illegally to resist arrest.”\n\nChatham County police said in a statement that they were unaware of the ICE operation and traffic stop before the deadly crash.\n\nChester Ellis, chairman of the Chatham County Board of Commissioners, noted that county police are constrained by a policy that allows vehicle pursuits only when officers believe a suspect has committed or is attempting to commit a violent felony. But he said county officers, had ICE requested their assistance, could have helped cut off the suspect's escape without a pursuit that endangered other drivers.\n\n“If that had been the case yesterday, then Dr. Davis would still be alive,” Ellis said. “My personal feeling is that one life lost is too many, especially when you’re taking about a precious teacher.”\n\nSavannah Mayor Van Johnson also questioned whether Davis' death might have been prevented.\n\n“I’ve always been and remain very concerned about the activities of ICE in cities, particularly where they’re not coordinating or communicating,” Johnson, a former police officer, told reporters Tuesday.\n\nHe added: “What this individual was wanted for, did it necessitate the end result?\"",

Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump was asked whether he’d done anything special on Feb. 14 with the first lady, whom he has been married to for more than 20 years, or whether he bothered to get her any flowers to celebrate the big day. “I better not tell you that, goodbye everybody,” Trump replied while sheepishly laughing. “That’s the toughest question.”",

    "description": "Juliette Bryant says not long after meeting Jeffrey Epstein, he assaulted her, and she realized, \"this is not a modeling opportunity, I've been kidnapped.\"",
    "fullText": "Juliette Bryant says she first met Jeffrey Epstein when she was a 20-year-old psychology and philosophy student in Cape Town, South Africa, who modeled part time.\n\nHer first interaction with the late American sex offender came by chance, when she was approached on a night out by a girl who offered to introduce her to a man who she said was described to her as American royalty.\n\n\"She said she knew a man who was here who was the 'King Of America,' and he was here with Bill Clinton and Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker. She told me that his best friend Leslie Wexner owns Victoria's Secret and it would be a very good idea for me to meet them because it could possibly help with my modeling career,\" Bryant told CBS News on Sunday. \"So we went along to the restaurant where they were having dinner down the road. And sure enough, there they were. Bill Clinton, Kevin Spacey, Chris Tucker, Jeffrey Epstein, and a few government officials from South Africa.\"\n\nBryant does not accuse Clinton, Spacey or Tucker of any wrongdoing, and she said her interaction with the men at the table was brief, lasting only about five minutes.\n\nBut the next day she received a call from the girl who made the introduction, telling her that Epstein would like to see her modeling portfolio.\n\n\"Epstein said he thought I'd be great for Victoria's Secret, and they left that day, but his office started phoning and arranging me a visa and tickets and everything,\" Bryant told CBS News. \"You know, I didn't have money or anything, but they said don't worry, they will deduct all my expenses from the income I made when I was there.\"\n\nBryant, a South African national, said she was surprised by how quickly Epstein was able to arrange for her travel to the United States.\n\n\"They arranged for me to get a visa to come to America. It was like a visitor's visa … and they arranged these visas very quickly, which is unusual in South Africa. It's usually very difficult to get a visa here. And then basically within three weeks, I was in America,\" she said.\n\nMultiple emails in the tranche of Epstein-related documents released by the Department of Justice and reviewed by CBS News appear to show a pattern of Epstein assisting or receiving legal counsel on how to secure visas for young women to come to the U.S., including from Eastern Europe.\n\nThe Free Press: WATCH: The Epstein Tapes\n\nEarlier this month, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced that the Polish government would create an analytical team to examine whether Polish children were abused via criminal networks connected to Epstein. Tusk also said \"links between Epstein and the entire pedophile circle and the Russian special services,\" would be investigated.\n\nBryant said very soon after she arrived in New York, she was told she would be heading to the Caribbean, to Epstein's private island.\n\n\"I obviously assumed it was for a modeling shoot,\" she said. \"We went to Teterboro airport and they were waiting on the airplane there, and you know, nothing was ever checked at any of these airports. They didn't check our passports, our luggage, nothing.\"\n\nBryant said her passport was taken from her on board, and she was then sexually assaulted.\n\n\"As the airplane took off, he [Epstein] started touching me forcibly in between my legs, and I freaked out. I realized, this is not a modeling opportunity, I've been kidnapped,\" Bryant told CBS News. \"They whisked me away to the island and then I was stuck there. They never arranged any modeling opportunities, I was basically completely conned.\"\n\nBryant said that for the next few years of her life, she was trafficked by Epstein. Her account of where she first met Epstein lines up with a time period during which Epstein lent his plane to former President Bill Clinton as part of a Clinton Foundation trip to Africa.\n\nBryant was eventually compensated as part of both the Epstein Victims' Compensation Program in 2020 and a separate settlement with JP Morgan Chase in 2023.\n\nPublic flight logs reviewed by CBS News show that Clinton left for a nine-day trip to Africa with actors Spacey and Tucker, on Epstein's private plane, in September 2002, visiting Ghana, Nigeria, Rwanda, Mozambique and South Africa.\n\nKFF Health News reported at the time that Clinton, Tucker and Spacey were on a Clinton Foundation trip to \"promote efforts to fight HIV/AIDS and economic development.\"\n\nIn a sworn declaration to the House Oversight Committee in January, Clinton said Epstein offered use of his private plane for himself, his staff and his Secret Service detail in support of the Clinton Foundation's philanthropic work between 2002 and 2003.\n\nClinton denied ever visiting Epstein's private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where a number of the late financier's crimes occurred, and maintained that he had not been in contact with the convicted pedophile for more than a decade before his 2019 arrest.\n\nInvestigators reviewing retail sales records for clues in Nancy Guthrie case\n\nInvestigators chase critical leads as Nancy Guthrie search enters third week\n\nMiracle babies of Mauthausen find each other decades after the Holocaust | 60 Minutes",

    "fullText": "Editor’s note: The opening date has been changed, along with the pricing tiers. The changes have been reflected in the story below.\n\n(KRON) — Last summer, a fast-rising Japanese BBQ chain based in Los Angeles announced its first Bay Area locations would open in Pleasanton, Milpitas and Santa Clara.\n\nChubby Cattle first opened only three years ago in Monterey Park (Los Angeles County), but the chain has quickly risen in popularity — already expanding with its first Bay Area outpost in Pleasanton.\n\nThe group behind Chubby Cattle is now opening a new concept for all-you-can-eat Japanese Wagyu, owners Chubby Group announced in a press release. The restaurant is named “Wagyu Master” and will open by the end of the month.\n\nWagyu Master is located at 1410 El Paseo de Saratoga and takes over a space that was previously occupied by The Melt and Tabu Shabu. It is located within the El Paseo de Saratoga shopping center.\n\nTentatively, Wagyu Master plans to open by Feb. 20, but if that does not happen, it will open before February ends, according to a restaurant representative. The San Jose location marks Chubby Group’s second “Wagyu Master” restaurant — the first debuting in Pasadena on Dec. 31, 2025.\n\nThe concept claims to be the first all-you-can-eat restaurant with 100% Japanese Wagyu, according to the Wagyu Group news release.\n\nMassive SF-based Asian restaurant opening at Westfield Valley Fair\n\nBad Bunny rents out Bay Area restaurant after Super Bowl halftime show\n\nWagyu Master offers two tiers for all-you-can-eat Wagyu.\n\nBoth tiers have access to the restaurant’s buffet line, which includes unlimited milk tea, desserts and other side dishes. Under both pricing options, there will be Zensai appetizers, chef speciality dishes, A5 Ribeye, A5 Striploin, vegetables, shime course and dessets.\n\nThe buffet has at least 80 items, highlighted by Crispy Squab, Beijing-Style Giant Wing, Charred Tongue Heart, live crab, and lobster specialties.\n\nAccording to the press release, Wagyu Master sources its Wagyu from Japan’s largest Wagyu supplier.\n\n“The future of dining is here — introducing Wagyu Master Pasadena, the first All-You-Can-Eat Shabu in the U.S. featuring 100% Japanese Wagyu,” Chubby Group founding partner David Zhao wrote on LinkedIn. “An authentic, premium experience that brings together craftsmanship, innovation, and community dining — all in one table.”\n\nChubby Cattle’s first location opened in April 2023 and has gained a social media fanbase of more than 25,000 Instagram followers.",

    "description": "The High-Speed Rail Authority said it was aware of the matter and reviewing it after the Feb. 3 arrest in Folsom.",
    "fullText": "The CEO of the embattled California High-Speed Rail Authority was one of two people arrested this month at his Folsom home following an alleged domestic disturbance between his fiancee and his daughter, hours after appearing beside Gov. Gavin Newsom at a rail event in Kern County.\n\nAccording to Folsom police logs, Ian Choudri, 57, was arrested just after midnight Feb. 4 after officers were called to his home. Police said officers responded to the residence and took Choudri and his fiancée, Lyudmyla Starostyuk, 46, into custody on suspicion of misdemeanor battery. A spokesperson for the Folsom Police Department confirmed the arrest and said both were booked and released from the Sacramento County Main Jail downtown.\n\nAllen Sawyer, an attorney for Choudri and Starostyuk, said the Sacramento County District Attorney’s Office “immediately” declined to file charges after Folsom police forwarded the incident.\n\n“Mr. Choudri was never asked to appear in court,” Sawyer said in an email Monday night. He added that “this matter is over and no further action will be taken.”\n\nAccording to dispatch recordings reviewed by The Sacramento Bee, Choudri was arrested after officers were called to the home for an alleged fight between Starostyuk and Choudri’s 17-year-old daughter. Dispatchers relayed to officers that Starostyuk had “pulled her hair and pushed her” before locking her out of the house. It was not clear who made the call to 911, but all three residents were outside the home when police arrived.\n\nChoudri and Starostyuk, a former professor at Metropolitan State University of Denver, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The police spokesperson said the department does not comment on specifics of arrests, referring further questions to the DA’s Office.\n\nThe District Attorney’s Office in a statement Tuesday said its investigators did not find sufficient evidence to charge Choudri before his expected arraignment on Feb. 6 because they could not determine a clear “dominate aggressor” in the incident.\n\n“Our office takes all allegations of domestic violence incredibly seriously, regardless of who the suspect is or what position they hold in our community,” the DA’s Office said in the statement. “Per Penal Code section 13701, in domestic violence situations law enforcement shall take steps to determine who the ‘dominant aggressor’ is to make the appropriate arrest. In this case, law enforcement arrested one male and one female. Officers did not see or note any injuries to either individual.”\n\n“Since the evidence does not clearly demonstrate a ‘dominant aggressor’ we determined there was insufficient evidence to file charges to sustain our burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt,” it said.\n\nThe arrest occurred hours after Choudri appeared with Gov. Gavin Newsom at a High-Speed Rail Authority facility in Kern County, where the governor touted progress on the long-delayed project and criticized the Trump administration’s decision to pull $4 billion in federal funding.\n\nNewsom’s office referred a request for comment to the High Speed Rail Authority.\n\nChoudri joined Newsom that day to announce the completion of the authority’s 150-acre railhead facility near Shafter, which will serve as a staging area for track construction in the Southern San Joaquin Valley.\n\n“The High-Speed Rail Authority is aware of the matter and is reviewing it,” a spokesperson for the agency said in a statement Monday night.\n\nChoudri was appointed CEO by the authority’s board of directors in August 2024. According to previous Bee reporting, he previously worked on large-scale construction projects in more than 18 countries.\n\nThe Bee’s Daniel Hunt contributed to this story.",

    "fullText": "ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) — A judge on Tuesday granted a request for a hearing to learn more about an investigation that led to charges against former University of Michigan football coach Sherrone Moore, who was arrested soon after he was fired for a relationship with his executive assistant.\n\nIt's a victory for Moore and lawyer Ellen Michaels who is defending him against charges of felony home invasion, stalking and illegal entry. They ultimately want the case dismissed.\n\nMoore, 40, is accused of entering the woman’s apartment without permission and threatening to kill himself in front of her on Dec. 10. Authorities quoted him as saying she was to blame for him losing one of the top college football jobs in the country. She had spoken to university officials.\n\nJudge J. Cedric Simpson expressed concern that a police detective didn’t disclose Moore's employer-employee relationship with the woman — a “glaring omission” — when a magistrate authorized a warrant for his arrest.\n\n“Defendant’s due process may have been violated,” Simpson said.\n\n\"This was not solely this personal relationship. The magistrate should have been able to look at that,\" said the judge, who set a March 2 hearing to hear from police and other witnesses.\n\nThe woman ended the personal relationship a few days before Moore's firing and did not answer a dozen calls or respond to some text messages from him before his dismissal, police said.\n\nMichaels said a coach calling and texting an executive assistant that many times was reasonable while Moore was preparing his team for a bowl game.\n\n“It’s not stalking if the communication has a legitimate purpose,” Michaels said.\n\nBefore Simpson set the hearing, Washtenaw County assistant prosecutor Kati Rezmierski said it wasn't necessary and would be outside the judge's discretion.\n\nMoore coached the Wolverines for two seasons as the successor to Jim Harbaugh, who won a national championship before quitting to become coach of the NFL’s Los Angeles Chargers. Kyle Whittingham, who coached Utah for two decades, is Michigan’s new coach.\n\nMichaels accused the woman's personal lawyer of giving information to police to “villainize Mr. Moore and maximize the chances of obtaining a large settlement from the deep pockets of the University of Michigan.”",

    "title": "Poll: How many Americans rank Trump as the 'worst' vs. 'best' president in U.S. history?",
    "description": "Amid this year's Presidents' Day celebrations, survey respondents tell Yahoo and YouGov that Trump is doing a worse job than Joe Biden and Barack Obama.",
    "fullText": "As Americans return to work and school after the long Presidents’ Day weekend, a new Yahoo/YouGov poll has found that 40% of them now consider Donald Trump to be the “worst president in U.S. history.”\n\nAnother 12% think Trump is “worse than average” — meaning that overall, a majority of Americans (about 53%) now rate Trump as one of the least successful presidents ever to hold the office.\n\nOnly a third of Americans say Trump is either the best president in U.S. history (12%) or better than average (21%). An additional 9% believe Trump “ranks somewhere in the middle.”\n\nThe survey of 1,704 U.S. adults was conducted just before Presidents’ Day, which roughly coincides with George Washington’s birthday and honors the first U.S. president as well as all those who served after him.\n\nHistorians often use Presidents’ Day as an opportunity to rank commanders in chief; the last major tally was published in February 2024 by the Presidential Greatness Project. In it, 154 current and recent members of the American Political Science Association awarded Abraham Lincoln, the top finisher, an average zero-to-100 score of 93.87. Trump finished last, with an average score of 10.92.\n\nBut that was before Trump’s comeback victory the following November — and before the sweeping changes of his first year back in office. So now, two Februaries later, how are ordinary Americans judging Trump’s second term in relation to the presidencies that preceded it?\n\nNot very positively. Trump’s job approval rating (38%) is currently as low as it has ever been; his disapproval rating (58%) is higher than ever. That puts Trump a full 20 points “underwater.” In comparison, former President Joe Biden was about 8 points underwater at this stage of his presidency.\n\nIn particular, independents — who tend to decide elections — have soured on Trump. Before Trump took office again, more independents said they expected him to change America for the better (41%) than said they expected him to change America for the worse (34%). But today, only 23% of independents say Trump is changing America for the better, while a clear majority (57%) say he is changing America for the worse.\n\nAll told, a majority of Americans now say for the first time that Trump is making America worse (52%) rather than better (34%) — and that his second term has turned out to be worse than they expected (51%) instead of better (25%).\n\nAmericans also think Trump is failing to meet the standard of performance set by his immediate Democratic predecessors.\n\nDespite the fact that Trump recently replaced a White House portrait of Biden with a photo of an autopen — and described Biden as “by far, the worst President in American History” on the plaque beneath the image — 49% of Americans think Trump is “doing a worse job than Biden.” Significantly fewer (41%) think Trump is doing a better job than Biden.\n\nAmong independents, a majority (53%) now believe Trump is doing worse than Biden. Just 33% say Trump is doing better.\n\nTrump compares even less favorably to former President Barack Obama — “one of the most divisive political figures in American History,” according to his new White House plaque. A full 55% of Americans think Trump is doing a worse job than Obama. Only 37% think Trump is doing better. Among independents, those numbers are 57% and 16%, respectively.\n\nThe president also faces a widening gap in the intensity of opinion between Americans who think he’s doing a good job and Americans who think he’s doing a bad job. Forty-nine percent now “strongly” disapprove of Trump’s job performance; less than half as many (22%) strongly approve.\n\nThe gap between Americans who consider Trump the worst president in U.S. history and those who consider him the best is similar.\n\nThe Yahoo survey was conducted by YouGov using a nationally representative sample of 1,704 U.S. adults interviewed online from Feb. 9 to 12, 2026. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, education, 2024 election turnout and presidential vote, party identification and current voter registration status. Demographic weighting targets come from the 2019 American Community Survey. Party identification is weighted to the estimated distribution at the time of the election (31% Democratic, 32% Republican). Respondents were selected from YouGov’s opt-in panel to be representative of all U.S. adults. The margin of error is approximately 3%.",

    "title": "Rick Perry says his political group will spend “whatever we need” to support John Cornyn in Senate primary",
    "description": "The former Texas governor chairs the Lone Star Freedom Project, a group that has already spent almost $18 million boosting Cornyn against Attorney General Ken Paxton and Rep. Wesley Hunt.",
    "fullText": "Stumping with Sen. John Cornyn in Austin on Tuesday, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry said the political group he chairs, called the Lone Star Freedom Project, would spend “whatever we need” to see Cornyn through his bruising Republican primary, on top of the almost $18 million it has spent on his behalf.\n\nCornyn, who is serving his fourth term in the U.S. Senate, is battling to keep his seat against challenges from Attorney General Ken Paxton and U.S. Rep. Wesley Hunt of Houston, in a contest that looks destined to go to a May runoff.\n\nOutside groups, Senate Republican leadership and Cornyn’s own fundraising committees have spent tens of millions of dollars to support the incumbent senator and attack his GOP rivals. The Senate race in Texas became the second-most expensive in the country Tuesday, according to AdImpact, with $98.2 million in total ad spending. Some three-quarters of the cash on the GOP side has come from pro-Cornyn sources — and yet, recent public polling has shown Paxton leading the contest.\n\nPerry’s group has spent more than all but one other group among Cornyn’s several outside backers, who along with the senator’s campaign have dropped nearly $60 million on the race, per AdImpact. The former governor made clear that would continue into the runoff if Cornyn makes it past the March 3 election.\n\n“We are committed to John, and we will spend whatever we need to spend for him to be successful,” Perry said when asked if he thought that level of fundraising and spending would continue.\n\nCornyn, kicking off a 10-stop statewide tour on the first day of early voting, warned that Republicans would see an “Election Day massacre” in November if he loses out on the Senate GOP nomination to Paxton.\n\n“Republicans up and down the ticket will pay the price of having an albatross like the corrupt attorney general hung around their neck,” Cornyn said at a Tex-Mex restaurant alongside Perry and other supporters, where he further argued that Paxton’s nomination could threaten the new red congressional seats Texas Republicans drew last summer to pad their slim House majority. “We haven’t lost a statewide election in Texas since 1994, but we could this year if the wrong person is at the top of the ticket.”\n\nThe senior senator has argued throughout the campaign that he would keep moderate and swing voters in the GOP tent who would otherwise be turned off by Paxton’s ethical baggage — a history that includes indictment, impeachment and federal investigations that the attorney general has all largely withstood.\n\nPaxton, meanwhile, is arguing in his campaign that Cornyn is a relic of the establishment GOP and ideologically out of step with President Donald Trump and his MAGA movement. The third-term attorney general has long been trailed by a list of legal and ethical woes — including securities fraud charges and impeachment by the GOP-controlled Texas House on bribery and abuse of office allegations — from which he has emerged largely unscathed. More recently, Paxton’s wife, state Sen. Angela Paxton, filed for divorce on “biblical grounds” after she accused him of cheating on her.\n\nIn a statement, Paxton adviser Nick Maddux said, “Character matters in this race, and that’s why the people of Texas overwhelmingly support Ken Paxton. They know that he is a conservative warrior who will always fight for us and our freedoms, even in the face of the Left trying to tear him down.”\n\nMaddux added that Cornyn “is just like every other career politician who talks tough during election season, but then does the exact opposite in D.C. and betrays Texas by repeatedly pushing gun control and amnesty.”\n\nTrump on Monday declined to make an endorsement in the primary, telling reporters, “They’ve all supported me, they’re all good and you’re supposed to pick one. So we’ll see what happens, but I support all three.”\n\nIn response, Cornyn said Tuesday that he would be “proud” to have Trump’s endorsement.\n\n“I appreciate his kind words, referring to me as a friend and calling me a good man,” Cornyn said. “The president knows he can trust me to be there to support him and his agenda, and I appreciate that. But it’s going to be up to him to make that call. I think he kind of likes a good fight, and he’s going to see one right here in Texas.”\n\nIn his remarks, Perry praised Cornyn’s work on border security and other conservative causes over his four decades in public office. The two were flanked by representatives from the National Border Patrol Council, which has endorsed Cornyn for reelection.\n\n“The people of the state of Texas know John Cornyn,” Perry said. “They know that character counts. They know that this man is going to go back to Washington, D.C., and day in and day out, deliver for them. What you have is a vanity campaign on the other side and a corrupt campaign on the other side.”\n\nIn a statement, Hunt spokesperson James Kyrkanides accused Perry of parroting talking points from Cornyn’s supporters in Senate GOP leadership and noted how much Cornyn-aligned groups have spent against Hunt.\n\n“If Hunt’s candidacy wasn’t a threat, why would [Perry] spend his own money attacking Wesley?” Kyrkanides said. “On March 3, Texans are going to prove that they’re tired of gutter politics and establishment games. They’re ready for a new generation of leadership.”\n\nAsked if he believed “character” still mattered in a Republican primary contest, Perry said, “We’re fixing to find out. If winning with a corrupt candidate is okay, then it ain’t the Republican Party that I joined in 1989.”\n\nThe Senate primary is Perry’s latest foray into a smashmouth GOP contest in his home state, after he campaigned for then-Texas House Speaker Dade Phelan in 2024 and helped the Beaumont Republican narrowly overcome a hardline challenger backed by Paxton. Perry also published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal ahead of Paxton’s impeachment trial in which he implied that state senators should reject Paxton’s efforts to dismiss the case.\n\nPaxton is also embarking on a get-out-the-vote tour during early voting, planning up to nine rallies across the state to “engage conservative voters, drive early voter turnout and build momentum statewide,” according to Lone Star Liberty PAC, a group backing Paxton and sponsoring the tour.\n\nTexas Rep. James Talarico, who is seeking the Democratic Senate nomination, also launched a “Take Back Texas” tour across the state Tuesday, featuring 12 rallies, in addition to stops at local restaurants and cultural landmarks, ahead of March 3.",

    "fullText": "PARIS (AP) — French authorities said Tuesday they released a tanker intercepted last month in the Mediterranean Sea which is suspected of being part of Russia’s sanctioned shadow fleet shipping oil in violation of international sanctions.\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said in a post on X that the tanker Grinch is to leave French waters after having paid a penalty of “several million euros” and “three weeks of costly immobilization.”\n\n“Circumventing European sanctions comes at a price. Russia will no longer be able to finance its war with impunity through a ghost fleet off our coasts,” Barrot said.\n\nThe French military diverted the ship last month and anchored it in the port of Fos-sur-Mer as part of an investigation into a charge of failure to fly a valid flag. The crew of Indian nationality was being kept on board.\n\n“As part of a guilty plea procedure the company that owns the vessel was sentenced by the Marseille judicial court to a financial penalty of confiscation,” the Marseille prosecutor’s office and regional maritime authorities said in a joint statement.\n\nThe exact amount of the fine was not disclosed.\n\nRussia is believed to be using a fleet of over 400 ships to evade sanctions over its war against Ukraine. France and other countries have vowed to crack down.\n\nThe fleet comprises aging vessels and tankers owned by nontransparent entities with addresses in non-sanctioning countries, and sailing under flags from such countries.\n\nLast September, French naval forces boarded another oil tanker off the French Atlantic coast that President Emmanuel Macron also linked to the shadow fleet. Putin denounced that interception as an act of piracy.\n\nThat tanker’s captain is to go on trial next week over the crew’s alleged refusal to cooperate.",

    "title": "Mamdani says if the state won't tax the wealthiest New Yorkers, he'd have to tax the middle class as a 'last resort'",
    "description": "Without a tax on the wealthy or big corporations, NYC Mayor Zohran Mamdani may have to hike property taxes instead.",
    "fullText": "Mayor Zohran Mamdani said a property tax hike is on the table as a \"last resort\" in New York City.\n\nHigher taxes on the wealthy is his preferred way to bridge the $5.4 billion budget deficit — but requires state buy-in.\n\nA potential tax hike could hit middle-class New Yorkers and renters.\n\nNew York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani says that if the state won't play ball on taxing the rich, he'll have to impose a higher tax of his own — and it could hit middle-class New Yorkers.\n\nAt a Tuesday press conference, he laid out two options to address what he said is the city's $5.4 billion budget deficit left by the prior administration.\n\nIn an effort to balance his preliminary $127 billion budget, Mamdani outlined two potential paths forward. The first — and Mamdani's preferred — relies on cooperation from New York Gov. Kathy Hochul: increasing taxes on the wealthy and corporations, a cornerstone of Mamdani's campaign. Hochul has been lukewarm on the idea.\n\nWithout Albany's willingness to hike income or corporate taxes, Mamdani is signaling he will need to turn to other measures to fund his budget. He's floating increasing property taxes for the city's residents — which would hit the middle and working classes as hard as his typical targets on Wall Street — alongside drawing from funds that the city keeps in reserve in case of an economic downturn.\n\nMamdani called that option \"painful,\" and \"a tool of very last resort,\" and said that his administration would continue working with Albany to avoid it.\n\n\"This is a preliminary budget,\" he said at the press conference. \"This is a budget that reflects the only tools that the city has at its disposal.\"\n\nIf Hochul or Albany do not budge, Mamdani said he would increase property taxes by 9.5%.\n\nIn the press conference, Mamdani said the tax would hit middle-class New Yorkers the most. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on which income groups would be most affected or on the proposal's potential impact on middle-income New Yorkers.\n\nMulti-unit buildings — where renters tend to live — are taxed at a higher effective rate than single-family or low-density homes, where more affluent New Yorkers tend to live. While renters don't pay property taxes directly, higher property tax levies on their landlords could, over time, translate into higher rents.\n\n\"New York's property tax system stems from the 1970s, trying to balance the needs of outer borough homeowners with the commercial and multifamily housing in Manhattan,\" Rita Jefferson, a local analyst at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy who focuses on equity, said. \"As a result, property tax rates on single-family homes are much lower than rates on multifamily units, which has led to vastly different bills for properties that have the same market value.\"\n\nNew York City Comptroller Mark Levine, an elected position not appointed by the Mayor, said that Mamdani had proposed a budget that \"honestly and transparently lays out the scale of our challenges,\" and that the city \"undoubtedly\" needs more assistance from Albany.\n\n\"To rely on a property tax increase and a significant draw-down of reserves to close our gap would have dire consequences,\" Levine said in a statement. \"Our property tax system is profoundly unfair and inconsistent, and an across-the-board increase in this tax would be regressive. Drawing down reserves during a period of economic growth would leave us vulnerable to economic turbulence next year.\"\n\nThe proposal was blasted by US Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, a Republican whose district includes Staten Island and parts of Southern Brooklyn.\n\n\"Year after year, City Hall squeezes the middle-class for more by raising the property tax levy, and now Mamdani wants to raise the rate, making the American dream of homeownership less attainable and the cost of housing even more unaffordable for property owners and renters alike,\" Malliotakis said in a statement.\n\nMamdani's proposal doesn't mean that renters or property owners will get hit with a large tax bill immediately; as he stressed in his press conference, the budget is far from final. Hochul reportedly said at an unrelated event that she doesn't think a property tax increase is necessary.\n\n\"This is something that we do not want to do,\" Mamdani said, \"and this is something that we are going to utilize every single option to ensure does not come to pass.\"",

    "description": "Changing your rep range and your workout intensity can help you build more muscle, says an exercise scientist with decades of gym experience.",
    "fullText": "Jim Stoppani has been lifting weights for longer than most fitness influencers have been alive.\n\n\"I'v been training since I was a young kid, probably 7 or 8,\" he told Business Insider. \"My father built an amazing gym in our basement and I wanted to hang out with my dad, so I was down there learning the principles of weightlifting.\"\n\nNow at 58, with a PhD in exercise physiology, his own supplement brand, and a renowned research career, Stoppani has learned from decades of scientific study and first-hand experience what it takes to pack on lean muscle.\n\nHe recommends three strategies everyone should know to make the most of every workout for optimal gains.\n\nOne thing Stoppani has learned over his years in fitness is that progress will plateau — unless you make smart training decisions and plan ahead.\n\nThe human body has natural limits in how much strength or muscle mass we can achieve. As you work out and get stronger, you'll get closer to those limits, but additional gains become increasingly more difficult to earn.\n\nInstead of fighting for diminishing returns, diversify your fitness with different elements like power, agility, mobility, and stamina to get the most bang for your buck in the gym.\n\n\"I'm not going to put on 20 pounds of muscle at my age and with so many years under my training belt,\" Stoppani said. \"So why should I come in here and train like a bodybuilder every day?\"\n\nTo free up time to work on different skills without losing gains, Stoppani often uses a technique called a superset. A superset involves alternating between two exercises that recruit different muscles, with little to no break in between. Doing so allows one muscle group to rest while the other is working, cutting out your downtime in the gym (and potentially burning more fat in the process).\n\nStoppani uses the extra time to work on yoga, stretching, and cardio, to avoid any weak points in his fitness.\n\n\"The thing that I recommend as you get older is to be less singular in your goals and more well-rounded,\" he said.\n\nA concept called \"reps in reserve\" can help make sure you're pushing hard enough to make the most of your workouts, according to Stoppani.\n\nAt the end of each set, think about how many more reps you could do, if you really had to.\n\nToo many reps in reserve, and you're leaving gains on the table. For instance, if you finish a set of 10 reps, and feel like you could easily do 10 more, you should increase your weight or reps until it feels challenging.\n\nHowever, you don't have to push to your absolute limit with every set. Working to total muscle failure, the most you can possibly lift, comes with a risk of injury, and isn't necessary if you aren't a competitive athlete.\n\nFor average gym-goers, the sweet spot for building muscle is one to three reps in reserve, said Stoppani.\n\nHe recommends waiting until the last set to push closer to failure, and ending the set when you're too tired to complete the exercise with proper form.\n\n\"The key to turning on muscle growth is getting closer to muscle failure,\" he said.\n\nForget what you've seen from fitness influencers. There's no magic number when it comes to making your muscles bigger or \"toning\" them.\n\nBuilding muscle is all about challenging your body, whether you're lifting heavy weights for a few reps, or light weights for a lot of reps, according to Stoppani.\n\nBut your choice of weights can lead to slightly different results over time: heavier weights are ideal for getting stronger, while lighter weights help to maximize the signal for muscle tissue to grow.\n\nAs a result, using a variety of strategies can help you make better progress in the long run.\n\n\"The biggest misconception is that you can just use one rep range and stick to that forever,\" Stoppani said. \"You're eventually going to stop getting the same results because you're providing the body the same stress over and over and over again.\"\n\nPrevent your gains from stalling with a periodization plan, breaking up your training into sections of 6 to 12 weeks each. For instance, you might start with sets of six to eight reps, focusing on building strength, and after two months, switch to sets of 10 to 12 reps help boost muscle growth.\n\n\"The best way to build muscle is with change,\" Stoppani said.",

    "description": "Christina Jones pushed herself to put in long hours at her job. A vehicle collision made her reconsider her work-life balance and start a business.",
    "fullText": "This interview is based on a conversation with Christina Jones, 40, the CEO of a nonprofit and management consulting firm based in Washington, DC. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy son, Xavier, less than a year old at the time, was fast asleep in his crib while I worked on a policy document as midnight approached.\n\nI was relatively new to my position at a Minnesota-based nonprofit that helps survivors of gender-based violence, and I wanted to demonstrate my value to the organization.\n\nIt was a shared document with other team members, so many could see that the timestamps indicated that I was revising it at 11 p.m.\n\nOne of my colleagues, a mom of teenagers, tried to coach me in a soft, gentle way. \"You don't need to be in here so late,\" she said. \"You need to get some rest.\"\n\nInstead of listening to her, I manipulated the system. I started setting my late-night emails to schedule-send so they arrived at 9 a.m. the next day.\n\nTriple-checking that the Ts were crossed and the Is were dotted was second nature to me. Women, especially Black women, are so often trying to prove ourselves because we want to show we belong.\n\nFor me, it goes back to my parents and community saying that we have to do twice as much to get half of what everyone else has.\n\nIt felt especially true for me in my 20s and early to mid-30s. I was ambitious and forging my legal career, including several years in the office of the attorney general for the District of Columbia.\n\nThe long hours and stress levels were OK for me because I was married without kids. Still, I continued in the same vein after I had Xavier, now 5, because I wanted to create so many things in my life and demonstrate my worthiness.\n\nThen my perspective changed. It took a vehicle collision involving my car and a tractor-trailer to make me reassess the situation.\n\nMy husband, Jason, two girlfriends, and I were driving to a restaurant on January 18, 2025, to celebrate my 39th birthday when it happened.\n\nThankfully, we were traveling at a low speed and emerged relatively unscathed with a few scratches. It was traumatic, but it might have been so much worse.\n\nThe experience scared me into thinking that I could have been taken out. The fact that it was my birthday made it particularly significant — a reminder that I only have one body and time is not infinite.\n\nI'd already been waffling about what to do about my current job for several months. Although it was interesting and challenging, I wondered whether I should start my own consultancy.\n\nFear had put me off. I earned six figures, my company paid 75% of my health insurance, and provided a 3% match to my retirement. The role was fully remote and offered other perks.\n\nI prayed a lot about it, asking God what I should do. It became very clear that I needed to listen, not sit on my dreams, and take this bet on myself.\n\nI needed buy-in from my husband, Jason, because it could have put our household at risk. Still, he and my mom were very supportive. \"What's the worst thing that can happen?\" they said. \"You're an attorney. You can go get another job if it doesn't work out.\"\n\nI'm a firm believer in not burning bridges and leaving a position as graciously as you came in. I resigned in mid-June 2025 and served two months' notice.\n\nMy firm, Command Joy Co., which helps people in the nonprofit field turn passion into sustainable impact, was launched last August.\n\nI'm still learning and growing, but the company is thriving. There is great satisfaction in guiding creatives through the business side of things.\n\nOne of the most challenging aspects of entrepreneurship can be a feeling of isolation. As a result, I go to lunch intentionally three or four times a month with other business owners and spitball ideas.\n\nAs for me-time, I've learned what recharges me, whether it's being near water or relaxing with friends.\n\nMy top priority is always my family. Having Jason and Xavier forces me to unplug in a good way.\n\nI like to think of my life right now as a slow unfold. Just because you were something in one season doesn't mean you have to stay like that in the seasons that follow.",

    "description": "Amazon shutters Blue Jay robot as it transitions to Orbital, a new modular warehouse system enhancing same-day delivery capabilities.",
    "fullText": "Amazon has pulled the plug on one of its newest warehouse robots, a few months after unveiling it.\n\nBlue Jay, a multi-armed robotic system Amazon launched in October for its same-day delivery warehouses, quietly shut down in January, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nMany employees who worked on the project were reassigned to other robotics initiatives, the people added, while asking not to be identified discussing private matters.\n\nThe move shows how hard it is to develop AI robotics technology that's useful and cost-effective. Generative AI has made huge gains in the digital world, thanks to free training data on the web. In the physical realm, useful training data is harder to come by, and the challenges of operating robots in real-world settings are much greater.\n\nTerrence Clark, an Amazon spokesperson, told Business Insider that Blue Jay's core technology will be carried over to other initiatives across the company's network of warehouses. He added that Blue Jay was one of several warehouse robotics bets Amazon has made, alongside efforts such as Vulcan, Sparrow, and Proteus.\n\n\"We're always experimenting with new ways to improve the customer experience and make work safer, more efficient, and more engaging for our employees,\" Clark said in a statement.\n\nBlue Jay was one of Amazon Robotics' biggest announcements last year.\n\nDeveloped in just over a year, far faster than earlier robots like Robin or Sparrow, it leveraged advances in AI to accelerate training and deployment. The machine featured multiple robotic arms capable of reaching and lifting several items at once, a design intended to boost productivity while creating a safer environment for frontline workers.\n\nWhen Amazon unveiled Blue Jay in October, the company said it was being piloted at a fulfillment center in South Carolina and described it as a \"core technology\" for powering same-day delivery while lowering costs.\n\nInternally, though, the project ran into headwinds. People familiar with the effort cited Blue Jay's high cost, manufacturing complexity, and implementation challenges as reasons it was ultimately put on pause.\n\nWhile the Blue Jay system itself is being shelved, Amazon plans to incorporate parts of its technology into future systems, including a new one called \"Flex Cell\" that will be more floor-mounted, the people said. (Blue Jay was mounted to the ceiling).\n\nThe shift is part of a move by Amazon away from an older same-day warehouse system known internally as \"Local Vending Machine,\" or LVM, the people said. LVM facilities were built as largely monolithic systems, with automation tightly integrated into a single, massive structure. Blue Jay was designed to operate within that framework.\n\nNow, Amazon is pivoting to a new same-day warehouse system called \"Orbital.\" Unlike LVM, Orbital is designed to be modular, consisting of many components that can be assembled in different configurations, according to the people who spoke to Business Insider. The more flexible structure is intended to make the system easier to deploy and scale.\n\nOrbital is better suited to smaller same-day delivery warehouses, rather than the sprawling fulfillment centers Amazon has historically operated.\n\nThe system could also potentially be installed as a micro-fulfillment solution in the back of Whole Foods stores, an area Amazon is prioritizing, the people said. Orbital is also expected to handle chilled products, such as groceries. Amazon is revamping its same-day delivery efforts to close the gap with Walmart in groceries and other perishable goods.\n\nAn Orbital rollout remains some time away. The first same-day warehouse built around the Orbital system is not expected to open until 2027, according to people familiar with the project.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "A woman explains why she stopped saving her favorite clothes and items for special occasions and how it helped her enjoy everyday life more.",
    "fullText": "I used to save my favorite clothes for a version of my life that never showed up.\n\nThe blazer stayed in my closet because it felt \"too professional\" for a normal day. The heels were waiting for a dinner I'd yet to be invited to. The earrings were longing for an occasion that felt important enough to justify wearing them. Meanwhile, I wore the same outfits on repeat — to work, to run errands, to all the places where my actual life was happening.\n\nI wasn't saving them for a rainy day. I was saving them for the perfect one. The problem was that \"special occasion\" never came.\n\nThis habit wasn't limited to clothes. I treated everything the same way. A Sephora gift card sat untouched in my drawer, waiting for something \"really worth it.\" I rationed my favorite lip gloss as if it were a limited resource. I refused to light my favorite candle unless the night felt special enough to deserve it. I even held onto the last spritz of my discontinued One Direction perfume for years, as if saving it could somehow make more.\n\nThe special occasion is always vague — an imaginary fancy dinner, a future milestone, a celebration that exists only in theory. So I wait. Years pass. The things I loved enough to save start to feel untouchable. By the time I consider using it, we've waited so long that it feels wrong to start now.\n\nLooking back, it sounds dramatic, but at the time, it felt practical. Why waste something nice on an ordinary day?\n\nThen one day, the thought hit me: why am I living my life like a waiting room?\n\nThat mindset didn't stop at my closet. Saving a jacket for the right moment slowly turned into saving fun for the weekends, saving joy for later, saving happiness for a version of life that felt more legitimate than the one I was already living.\n\nI realized I was treating weekdays like something to get through instead of something to participate in. When I did the math on how many days I was mentally skipping, it felt less like discipline and more like quietly wasting my life away.\n\nThe shift was small at first. I wore blazers to the bars. I strutted in my nice heels to run errands. I put on the earrings just to go to the grocery store. Not for compliments, not for Instagram, not to prove anything to anyone, but because I liked how it made me feel.\n\nThe clothes didn't lose their value because I wore them. They gained it. Each piece started collecting moments and memories instead of dust. Now, when I reach for something I love, it reminds me of a workday that felt a little lighter or a Trader Joe's run where I found my new favorite snack.\n\nThat's the part people tend to dismiss as \"romanticizing your life,\" a phrase that's been flattened into internet fluff. But this wasn't about pretending my errands were glamorous or turning my Mondays into Fridays. It was about presence. About intention. About letting regular days count instead of treating them like placeholders.\n\nIf I'm being honest, it changed more than my outfits. Work felt less like something I had to endure. Errands felt less like chores. I stopped waiting for permission to enjoy my life. I started dressing for myself instead of an imaginary audience or a hypothetical future. I even started liking Mondays.\n\nI realized the dinner counts. The errand counts. The workday counts. And if the opportunity does truly come? I'll wear those pieces again. Clothes are meant to be worn more than once.\n\nThe special occasion didn't disappear. I just stopped waiting for it to arrive.",

    "description": "\"The Late Show\" host Stephen Colbert said CBS blocked an interview over FCC concerns. It highlights tension between broadcasters and their talent.",
    "fullText": "Stephen Colbert said CBS pulled a Democratic lawmaker's interview from \"The Late Show\" over concerns about federal regulations. So, he posted it on YouTube instead.\n\nThe dispute marks the latest flash point in a growing tension between late-night hosts, broadcast networks, and the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nJames Talarico, a Democratic Texas state representative running for a highly competitive US Senate seat, was scheduled to appear on \"The Late Show\" on Monday night.\n\nColbert told viewers during his monologue that network lawyers intervened.\n\n\"He was supposed to be here,\" Colbert said Monday night. \"But we were told in no uncertain terms by our network's lawyers, who called us directly, that we could not have him on the broadcast.\"\n\nColbert said he was also told not to acknowledge the decision on air.\n\n\"Then I was told, in some uncertain terms, that not only could I not have him on, I could not mention me not having him on,\" he said. \"And because my network clearly doesn't want us to talk about this, let's talk about this.\"\n\nCBS said in a statement that it did not prohibit \"The Late Show\" from broadcasting the interview. It said it gave the show legal guidance.\n\nWhile CBS didn't air the interview on TV, the show uploaded it overnight to its YouTube page. By midday Tuesday, the video had racked up more than 2 million views — significantly more than other recent guest interviews, which had largely drawn between about 75,000 and 510,000 views on YouTube.\n\nThe last guest to surpass 1 million views was Bad Bunny, who appeared on \"The Late Show\" ahead of his Super Bowl halftime performance.\n\nColbert said the network's concerns stemmed from the FCC's so-called \"equal time\" rule, which requires broadcast stations to provide equivalent opportunities to legally qualified political candidates.\n\n\"It's the FCC's most time-honored rule, right after 'No nipples at the Super Bowl,'\" Colbert said on Monday night's television-aired monologue.\n\nThe rule applies to over-the-air television and radio broadcasters, but not to cable channels or online platforms — meaning CBS's broadcast would fall under its purview, while YouTube would not.\n\nHe said most late-night talk shows — including his own — typically qualify for what's known as the \"bona fide news exemption.\"\n\nThat carve-out is designed to give news and public affairs programs flexibility to respond to events without having to book opposing candidates for balance.\n\nColbert has hosted several Democratic and independent lawmakers this year, including Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Virginia Gov. Abigail Spanberger, and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\n\nIn recent months, the FCC has stepped up scrutiny of broadcast networks.\n\nOn January 21, the FCC's Media Bureau published a letter that said it had \"not been presented with any evidence\" that any current late-night or daytime talk show qualifies for the \"bona fide news exemption.\"\n\nColbert said that the letter is part of what worried CBS's lawyers.\n\nCBS said in its statement that, \"The show was provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the FCC equal-time rule for two other candidates, including Rep. Jasmine Crockett, and presented options for how the equal time for other candidates could be fulfilled.\" It said the show decided to publish the interview through its YouTube channel instead.\n\nLast week, the FCC opened a probe into Disney-owned ABC after \"The View\" hosted Talarico.\n\nIn the YouTube interview, Talarico said the regulatory scrutiny was politically motivated.\n\n\"I think that Donald Trump is worried that we're about to flip Texas,\" Talarico told Colbert. \"This is the party that ran against cancel culture, and now they're trying to control what we watch, what we say, what we read.\"\n\nTalarico is locked in a competitive Democratic primary for the Senate seat against Rep. Jasmine Crockett. The winner is expected to face a Republican nominee that could include incumbent Sen. John Cornyn, former Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, or Rep. Wesley Hunt.\n\nThe open Senate seat is set to be decided during this year's mid-term elections.\n\nMonday's standoff adds to an already complicated period for Colbert and his network.\n\nIn July, CBS said \"The Late Show\" would be canceled in May 2026, a move that was \"purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night.\"\n\nIt came after Colbert criticized CBS's decision to settle a $16 million class-action lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump over its editing of a \"60 Minutes\" interview with his then-presidential opponent, Kamala Harris.\n\nSome lawmakers raised concerns about CBS's decision, questioning whether it was political.\n\nCBS is owned by Paramount, which was acquired in August by David Ellison's Skydance Media.\n\nThe network has faced other turbulence in recent months. Recently installed CBS News editor in chief Bari Weiss was criticized for her December decision to delay a \"60 Minutes\" segment on the Trump administration's use of jails in El Salvador. And, on Monday night, Anderson Cooper said he would be leaving \"60 Minutes\" after 20 years on the show.\n\nThe FCC and representatives for Colbert did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "Memory chip costs are up as AI companies gobble up the hot commodity. Consumer electronics companies like Dell and HP are raising prices.",
    "fullText": "Did that computer you were eyeing jump in price? Is that gaming handheld out of stock? You might want to practice a new refrain: Thanks, memory shortage.\n\nAs AI companies demand increasingly large troves of chips to power their large language models, memory chips remain in short supply. That's bad news for much of the consumer electronics market, which relies on DRAM and NAND memory chips.\n\nThe research firm IDC expects \"significant pressure on the memory ecosystem,\" warning that supply growth would be below historical norms this year. Electronics companies from Valve to Framework have already changed their sales procedures because of the shortage. Even Apple, the industry goliath, said it was expecting supply chain pressures on memory that would weigh on its famously high gross margin.\n\nThe memory shortage has existed for months — but it's beginning to affect more shoppers' wallets. And the bad news is it's not expected to let up anytime soon.\n\nElectronics CEOs are sounding the alarm for \"RAMageddon.\"\n\nJust last week, Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing told Reuters that he expected PC unit sales to \"face pressure.\" Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan predicted that there would be \"no relief until 2028.\"\n\nDell has already begun adjusting its device prices, according to an internal list of price changes sent to staff in December seen by Business Insider. The company raised the prices of its Dell Pro and Pro Max notebooks and desktops with 32GB of memory by between $130 and $230, among other increases.\n\nHP also planned price hikes \"across the board\" thanks to the memory shortage, its CEO said on its November earnings call.\n\nSmaller PC makers — which may not enjoy the same amount of supply-chain leverage as their tech titan peers — have also been hit especially hard.\n\nFramework raised its prices in December, then again in January, and again in February. Corsair accidentally underpriced its DRAM kits, canceling preorders and sending out coupons. It then raised prices days later, citing \"market costs.\"\n\nThe gaming device market is also struggling. Valve updated the site for its popular Steam Deck handheld device to say that it may be \"out-of-stock intermittently in some regions due to memory and storage shortages.\" The company also said it must \"revisit\" the pricing and scheduling of its upcoming Xbox and Playstation competitor, the Steam Machine, and VR headset, the Steam Frame, because of the shortage.\n\nBigger players could be next on the horizon: Bloomberg reported over the weekend that Sony was considering pushing back the launch of the next PlayStation, and that Nintendo was considering a price hike for the Switch 2.\n\nSome companies could choose to absorb any associated cost increases at the expense of their margins, opting to wait out the supply crunch.\n\nMeanwhile, bigger and bigger names keep speaking out about the shortage and its impacts.\n\nElon Musk warned of a \"chip wall\" on Tesla's fourth-quarter earnings call. Tim Cook pointed to the shortage on Apple's fourth-quarter earnings call, saying that the company was watching memory prices increase \"significantly.\"\n\nThis is where things get a bit more technical, but it all boils down to basic supply and demand.\n\nThere are three types of chips that are important to know. DRAM (dynamic random access memory) and NAND (non-volatile flash memory) are crucial for building consumer devices. HBM (high-bandwidth memory) chips are used to help train large language models.\n\nThree companies dominate the memory chip market: Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron. These companies also produce HBM chips.\n\nAI companies are hungry for more and more chips, and are willing to break out the checkbook to be first in line for factory production — giving them an edge over many consumer tech companies. They're also flush with cash, with companies like Microsoft and Meta projecting multi-billion-dollar capital expenditures, much of which is going toward AI-related costs like chip acquisition.\n\nThat leaves chipmakers responding to the spike in demand by raising prices, selling supply to AI companies, and some transitioning to HBM production.\n\nThe shortage isn't fading anytime soon. SK Hynix has long secured demand for its entire 2026 DRAM and NAND production volume. The CEO of Micron predicted on its first-quarter earnings call that supply would remain substantially short for the \"foreseeable future.\"\n\nAnd if you're trying to build your own PC, a mere consumer navigating the increasingly volatile memory marketplace: Good luck.",

    "fullText": "A union with 1.8 million members is asking the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate Apollo Global Management's past statements about Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nIn a letter to the SEC's head of enforcement on Tuesday, the American Federation of Teachers accused the asset manager of making \"misleading\" claims about its exposure to the convicted sex offender.\n\nThe letter says that Apollo previously suggested that its Epstein risk was largely limited to cofounder Leon Black, who stepped down as CEO in 2021 — after a law firm hired by Apollo found that Black paid Epstein millions over the years for financial advice.\n\nThe letter went on to say that the Justice Department's latest release of Epstein files suggests the firm provided an \"inaccurate and incomplete picture of the firm and its partners' connections to Epstein.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Apollo CEO Marc Rowan stood by the firm's 2021 disclosure to investors, saying that no one other than Black \"had either a business or personal relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.\"\n\n\"There is nothing new here,\" the statement said. \"While Mr. Epstein sought to do work with the Apollo cofounders other than Mr. Black, it was declined at every turn.\"\n\nThe AFT, whose members have billions in pension money invested with Apollo, cited communications between cofounders Rowan and a third cofounder, Josh Harris, released by the DOJ on January 30. It noted communications between Rowan and Epstein spanned from 2013 to 2016, including a 2016 email showing Rowan and Epstein discussing \"Apollo calculations for a tax receivable agreement.\"\n\n\"As the Epstein files make clear, Apollo partners Rowan and Harris appear to have consulted with Epstein on numerous personal and professional matters,\" the letter said.\n\n\"Clearly, there is material risk in this association with Apollo's business, and its investors deserve to be accurately informed about that matter,\" said the letter to the SEC's Margaret Ryan.",

    "title": "Mamdani says if the state won't tax the wealthiest New Yorkers, he'd have to tax the middle class as a 'last resort'",
    "description": "Without a tax on the wealthy or big corporations, NYC Mayor Zohran Mamdani may have to hike property taxes instead.",
    "fullText": "New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani says that if the state won't play ball on taxing the rich, he'll have to impose a higher tax of his own — and it could hit middle-class New Yorkers.\n\nAt a Tuesday press conference, he laid out two options to address what he said is the city's $5.4 billion budget deficit left by the prior administration.\n\nIn an effort to balance his preliminary $127 billion budget, Mamdani outlined two potential paths forward. The first — and Mamdani's preferred — relies on cooperation from New York Gov. Kathy Hochul: increasing taxes on the wealthy and corporations, a cornerstone of Mamdani's campaign. Hochul has been lukewarm on the idea.\n\nWithout Albany's willingness to hike income or corporate taxes, Mamdani is signaling he will need to turn to other measures to fund his budget. He's floating increasing property taxes for the city's residents — which would hit the middle and working classes as hard as his typical targets on Wall Street — alongside drawing from funds that the city keeps in reserve in case of an economic downturn.\n\nMamdani called that option \"painful,\" and \"a tool of very last resort,\" and said that his administration would continue working with Albany to avoid it.\n\n\"This is a preliminary budget,\" he said at the press conference. \"This is a budget that reflects the only tools that the city has at its disposal.\"\n\nIf Hochul or Albany do not budge, Mamdani said he would increase property taxes by 9.5%.\n\nIn the press conference, Mamdani said the tax would hit middle-class New Yorkers the most. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on which income groups would be most affected or on the proposal's potential impact on middle-income New Yorkers.\n\nMulti-unit buildings — where renters tend to live — are taxed at a higher effective rate than single-family or low-density homes, where more affluent New Yorkers tend to live. While renters don't pay property taxes directly, higher property tax levies on their landlords could, over time, translate into higher rents.\n\n\"New York's property tax system stems from the 1970s, trying to balance the needs of outer borough homeowners with the commercial and multifamily housing in Manhattan,\" Rita Jefferson, a local analyst at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy who focuses on equity, said. \"As a result, property tax rates on single-family homes are much lower than rates on multifamily units, which has led to vastly different bills for properties that have the same market value.\"\n\nNew York City Comptroller Mark Levine, an elected position not appointed by the Mayor, said that Mamdani had proposed a budget that \"honestly and transparently lays out the scale of our challenges,\" and that the city \"undoubtedly\" needs more assistance from Albany.\n\n\"To rely on a property tax increase and a significant draw-down of reserves to close our gap would have dire consequences,\" Levine said in a statement. \"Our property tax system is profoundly unfair and inconsistent, and an across-the-board increase in this tax would be regressive. Drawing down reserves during a period of economic growth would leave us vulnerable to economic turbulence next year.\"\n\nThe proposal was blasted by US Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, a Republican whose district includes Staten Island and parts of Southern Brooklyn.\n\n\"Year after year, City Hall squeezes the middle-class for more by raising the property tax levy, and now Mamdani wants to raise the rate, making the American dream of homeownership less attainable and the cost of housing even more unaffordable for property owners and renters alike,\" Malliotakis said in a statement.\n\nMamdani's proposal doesn't mean that renters or property owners will get hit with a large tax bill immediately; as he stressed in his press conference, the budget is far from final. Hochul reportedly said at an unrelated event that she doesn't think a property tax increase is necessary.\n\n\"This is something that we do not want to do,\" Mamdani said, \"and this is something that we are going to utilize every single option to ensure does not come to pass.\"",

    "description": "I visited a huge toy fair in NYC to find the next hot new trend. Labubus are over. Next up for kids and the young at heart? The highland cow.",
    "fullText": "I'm calling it: If you haven't already, you're going to start seeing highland cows in toy aisles around the country.\n\nAfter visiting one of the industry's largest fairs earlier this week, I think I'm qualified to say: The shaggy cow is taking over as the hot new animal for plush toys.\n\nIf you've been paying attention to toys — or if you have kids — you probably already know capybaras are big, but they've been the hot thing for more than a year now. Same with axolotls, the eerily cute pink salamanders. Those trends are peaking, though.\n\nStuffed animals seem to go in trend cycles. In the mid-2010s, llamas and owls were all over baby and kids' clothes and toys. Before that, hedgehogs and foxes.\n\nNot everyone I talked to at the Toy Fair, the toy industry convention held in New York over Presidents Day weekend, agreed with my assessment. I got a few other surprising predictions:\n\nBut enough people I asked said the same thing — that the trending animal is the highland cow, with its caramel fur and tawny mop of hair — that I feel I can say there's a modest consensus.\n\nLike I said, not everyone agreed on the cow. But there was agreement, among everyone I talked to, about three things casting a long shadow over the toy business: tariffs, TikTok, and Labubus.\n\nI chatted with several small to midsize toy companies who said that the tariffs that began when President Donald Trump declared \"Liberation Day\" have hurt their businesses. One plush toy maker said they're paying $10,000 extra per container in tariff charges for their high-end plush animals made in the Philippines. They haven't raised prices yet, and the new fees just eat into their profit. Another plush maker said that they raised prices once after tariffs, but are trying to avoid another hike.\n\nToy makers' ears must've been burning when Trump made comments about how perhaps kids could learn to live with just a few dolls instead of many. But Trump was right about something — kids do often have more toys now than they did 30 years ago because toys are, in fact, cheaper than ever.\n\nThe rate of inflation for toys is well below the national average for all things, meaning a Barbie or Hot Wheel costs relatively less today than it did back in 1995. (If you're a parent looking at a mess of toys spilling out of boxes and shelves, you're not alone.) Part of the reason toys have gotten cheaper is overseas manufacturing, which the tariffs are now hitting.\n\nThe big toy brands like Barbie, Lego, and Pokémon all had new items to debut at the fair. Among the smaller toy brands, a few trends emerged — blind boxes were huge, and many brands and distributors had cute figurines packaged in blind boxes or adopted the aesthetic of twee characters sold alongside Labubus at the Hong Kong-based retailer Pop Mart.\n\nStill, no one seemed to think there was a clear heir apparent to Labubus, which were a singular meteoric event in the toy world (yes, there have been viral toys before, like Beanie Babies or Tickle-Me-Elmos, but the rapid internet and celebrity-fueled Labubu phenomenon feels unique).\n\n\"Labubu is such a great example of something from nothing, but really built on the foundation of everything. Blind boxes have been massive. Plush has been massive. It was the amalgamation of a ton of the listening, and it then getting discovered,\" said Eric Morse, VP of new business initiatives at Spirit Halloween said during a panel talk about Gen Alpha trends.\n\nMorse went on to explain they used a similar strategy for rushing out \"K-Pop Demon Hunters\" costumes this October after the surprise hit debuted on Netflix over the summer. (Of course, even though they pushed through a licensed costume at a far faster speed than normal, they still sold out well before Halloween, much to the ire of 8-year-olds everywhere.) \"How we view the business is listen first, execute second,\" Morse said.\n\nWhen toy and candy trends happen rapidly on TikTok, it can be hard to predict surges in demand. And with on-again, off-again tariffs, it's even harder to plan, lots of industry insiders told me. That's something I kept hearing from all the vendors I talked with: uncertainty.\n\nBut one thing I feel confident about is highland cows. You heard it here first, folks.",

    "fullText": "The rivalry between xAI and OpenAI is heating up again — this time, over wood-fired pizza.\n\nOver the weekend, Elon Musk and an OpenAI engineer jockeyed on X about wood-fired crusts, dough fermentation, and campus chefs.\n\nOn its face, it was a lighthearted back-and-forth about free pizza for lunch. Underneath, it encapsulates a trend playing out in Silicon Valley: rival AI companies are publicly pitching culture — and perks like free lunch — in the talent war for top engineers.\n\nThe exchange began when Musk reposted a video of an xAI engineer calling his job the \"opportunity of a lifetime.\"\n\nJoin @xAI https://t.co/Fo3kjhaTXA\n\nThe post quickly drew a response from xAI's competitor, OpenAI.\n\n\"Or join Codex,\" said Thibault Sottiaux, an engineering lead working on OpenAI's Codex software agent, who is also hiring. OpenAI operates \"with much of the same principles,\" he wrote — before adding an increasingly common recruitment pitch.\n\n\"Join the bright side, we have pizza,\" Sottiaux wrote.\n\nJoin the bright side, we have pizza\n\nMusk fired back: \"But how good is your wood oven pizza?\"\n\nThe pizza posturing then shifted to ingredients — and the corporate chefs preparing them.\n\n\"But how about the dough?\" he wrote back. \"Can't take shortcuts, needs 24 hours at least. And our chef is 🔥.\"\n\nOur chef is so good that God looked down at the food from heaven and said you my most delicious creation 👼\n\n\"Our chef is so good that God looked down at the food from heaven and said you my most delicious creation,\" Musk replied.\n\n\"And after having a bite, he wasn't 100% satisfied and asked our chef to improve upon the SoTA,\" Sottiaux said. \"Our chef delivered, and created a recipe now universally credited to accelerating the AGI timeline.\"\n\nThe tomato pie-based banter was sweet — but the subtext was spicier.\n\nAI labs are locked in a high-stakes dash for elite engineers, with high-end compensation packages stretching into the nine-figure territory.\n\nCompanies including Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, OpenAI, and Musk's xAI are competing for a relatively small pool of researchers capable of building the next generation of models and infrastructure.\n\nAside from money, two key perks have emerged in the AI talent wars, according to professional AI poacher Mark Zuckerberg: access to GPUs and fewer direct reports.\n\n\"People say, 'I want the fewest number of people reporting to me and the most GPUs,'\" Zuckerberg said in 2025 TITV interview.\n\nAt the same time, the broader tech industry has pulled back on many of the pre-pandemic perks amid cost-cutting. Remote work has narrowed, layoffs have gathered steam, and perks like pet care stipends and expansive wellness benefits are becoming less common for new hires.\n\nBut there's one perk that has remained: the fancy lunch spread.\n\nMight as well throw in wood-fired pizza, too.",

    "description": "Users could be tricked into running arbitrary code, but the issue was patched last week.",
    "fullText": "AI-related changes to Notepad—yes, that Notepad—allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code on your computer. The vulnerability was related to Markdown support, which was added last year. Markdown is a simple way to add formatting, including links, to plaintext documents—and links were the source of the vulnerability.\n\n\"An attacker could trick a user into clicking a malicious link inside a Markdown file opened in Notepad, causing the application to launch unverified protocols that load and execute remote files,\" according to the security response notice.\n\nMarkdown has long been popular in certain parts of the internet—anyone who occasionally comments on Reddit or chats using Discord is likely at least a little familiar with it. But the markup language has become even more important in the age of AI—most documents are converted to plain text Markdown files to train models.\n\nMarkdown support was added around the same time Copilot was integrated into Notepad, as part of a broader push to add AI to every corner of the operating system. And there's an argument to be made that all these AI additions are adding up to new vulnerabilities. Microsoft patched 1,129 bugs in 2025 according to Krebs on Security, a prominent cybersecurity blog. That's an 11.9% increase over the previous year, which was already unusually high. Microsoft itself admits that AI agents will open up new vulnerabilities, even as the company adds them to Windows.\n\nThis is all to say that installing security updates is likely more important now than ever. Sure, you could disable all AI features in Windows, but that's unlikely to protect you from all the new vulnerabilities—installing Linux might, though.\n\nLuckily for Windows users, this vulnerability was fixed in Microsoft's February 2026 security update. To find out if you've installed it, open the Settings app, head to \"Windows Update,\" then check if an update labeled \"2026-02 Security Update\" is waiting to be installed. If so, click the \"Restart Now\" button to install the update.",

    "title": "Here Are the New Features Coming in iOS 26.4",
    "description": "Let AI create Apple Music playlists for you.",
    "fullText": "iOS 26.3 was a decidedly small update. It introduced a new tool to transfer data to Android, and gave some iPhones the ability to hide precise location data from cellular networks. But beyond some other small changes and security patches, that's all there was to write home about. iOS 26.4 is a different story. The update, which is currently in beta testing, adds a number of interesting new features to compatible iPhones, especially if you're an Apple Music user.\n\nAs with all beta software, iOS 26.4 is currently in testing, which means these features are subject to change at any time. It's possible some won't make it to the official release of iOS 26.4, while others could look different than they do now. While you can install the iOS 26.4 beta at any time by enrolling your device in the beta program, do so at your own discretion. I'd recommend using a secondary device to test this software if you can, but either way, make sure the device in question is fully backed up to a computer before installing the beta.\n\nThe latest trend in streaming services seems to be AI-generated playlists. YouTube Music recently rolled out the option, while Spotify offers a couple different takes on the feature. The idea is to tell the AI what type of music you want to listen to, whether that be a specific artist or genre, or just a concept or mood (e.g., \"Make me a playlist for drinking coffee on a lazy Sunday morning\").\n\nNow Apple Music is the latest service to introduce such a feature. The first iOS 26.4 beta comes with \"Playlist Playground,\" which works about how you'd expect. You tell Apple Music's AI what you want to hear, and it generates a playlist with 25 different songs. You can adjust the playlist if you don't like the result, as well as edit the title, cover image, and description.\n\nIn addition to Playlist Playground, Apple Music's UI is also changing in iOS 26.4. You'll see new full-page artwork when listening to music, as well as redesigned albums and playlists that adjust their colors based on the artwork. Plus, there's now a \"Concerts Near You\" feature that helps you find shows in your area, based on the music you like to listen to.\n\nRCS support is the best thing to happen to the iPhone in a long time. It makes texting Android users about the same as texting iPhone users, which has not been the case for most of iMessage's history. But while most of the standard perks rolled in with the update, including functioning group chats and high-quality image sharing, one key feature did not: end-to-end encryption (E2EE).\n\nWithout (E2EE), your messages can be intercepted and read by those with the skills to do so. With E2EE, they cannot. It's a major security feature that's key to both iMessage and RCS, and one of the reasons you shouldn't send messages over SMS, as it doesn't support E2EE. Not all Android setups support E2EE over RCS, but it's still a bummer that the iPhone's Messages app doesn't either.\n\nThat's now changing. With the first iOS 26.4 beta, Apple is now testing E2EE for RCS. You'll find the option in Settings, though Apple notes that not all devices or carriers support it. Someday soon, however, iPhone users texting Android users over RCS will be able to enjoy the added security benefits of E2EE.\n\nWith iOS 26.4, Apple changed the Wallpapers settings menu. Before, you could select from pre-downloaded wallpaper packs on your iPhone; now, you can choose which packs you want to download instead. It's a small change, but an interesting one at that. It seems Apple doesn't want to assume you're interested in all of its wallpaper options anymore, and instead would rather pick and choose the ones you want to try. Apple also made similar changes to picking watch faces in the Apple Watch app.\n\nIf you ever label reminders as \"urgent\" on your iPhone, you'll find them in a new location. Now, when you open Reminders, you'l find an Urgent section, alongside other options like Today, All, and Scheduled.\n\nWhile this isn't an iOS feature, it is a key new change in the first macOS 26.4 beta. Apple is now testing a \"charge limit\" feature on Mac, similar to the charge limit feature that already exists on iOS; when your device is plugged in for a long period of time, it will limit how much the battery can charge to. You can set the cap as low as 80%, or as high as 100%. The idea is, by limiting the charge level, you reduce how often the battery completes a full charge cycle, which can prolong its lifespan and delay aging. The \"younger\" your battery is, the longer it'll last between charges, so enthusiasts like to use these features to maximize how much battery life they can get out of their devices.",

    "description": "This is the first zero-day in Google Chrome this year.",
    "fullText": "If you use Google Chrome, you should install the latest update ASAP. Google has issued a patch for a high-severity flaw that has been actively exploited in the wild—the first Chrome zero-day in 2026.\n\nThe latest flaw, catalogued as CVE-2026-2441, is a use-after-free vulnerability in CSSFontFeatureValuesMap, Chrome's CSS font feature implementation. A use-after-free vulnerability is a flaw in which an application attempts to use memory after it has been released back to the system. This type of bug allows attackers to execute code, escalate privileges, cause app or system crashes, and leak sensitive data.\n\nCVE-2026-2441 would allow \"a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code inside a sandbox via a crafted HTML page.\" Essentially, this means malicious HTML content could run code inside a Chrome tab, extension, or plugin. As Malwarebytes explains, this is dangerous because attackers can see or modify whatever the isolated browser tab (sandbox) can access, allowing actions like credential harvesting and traffic rerouting—even if it cannot escape to impact the whole operating system.\n\nGoogle said that this vulnerability has been exploited in the wild but hasn't provided any specific details as to how. The discovery has been attributed to Shaheen Fazim.\n\nGoogle released a Stable channel update on Feb. 13 with a patch for this flaw. The latest versions of Chrome are 145.0.7632.75/76 for Windows and macOS and 144.0.7559.75 for Linux, so you'll want to ensure you are up to date. Go to the Chrome menu and select About Google Chrome to check which version you're on.\n\nChrome updates automatically when you close and reopen the browser, but if you don't do that regularly, keep an eye out for pending updates in the top-right corner of your browser window. Apply these updates immediately by tapping the three dots and selecting the first menu item. Chrome will need to restart to complete the update.",

    "title": "When to Choose Resistance Bands vs. Dumbbells",
    "description": "One is more portable, the other more versatile. Here's how to choose.",
    "fullText": "Resistance bands and dumbbells are both great for strength training at home, since they don’t require much storage space and tend to be a lot cheaper than a full setup with a barbell and plates. But they each have pros and cons, so let’s talk about how to choose.\n\nIf you buy beefy enough resistance bands, they offer a lot of resistance. A pair of “strong” bands from EliteFTS will pull on a barbell with the same force as 122 to 275 pounds of weights, depending on how far you stretch them. During the time gyms were closed because of COVID, coach Greg Nuckols told us that a set of bands would be his pick for training as heavy as possible without traditional gym equipment.\n\nIf you truly love resistance bands, you can probably figure out how to do almost anything with them. But for most of us, dumbbells are a little more intuitive and it’s easier to find exercises that work appropriate muscles.\n\nIf you use a resistance band, for many exercises you’ll need to find a place to anchor it. Sometimes you step on the band, so it’s pulling on your feet (not always comfortable if you work out barefoot). Other times you’ll need an appropriate anchor at floor level, or overhead, or straight in front of you. Depending on where you work out, there may not be anything strong enough to do the job with the right placement.\n\nThis means it's easier to put together a routine with dumbbells: you just pick them up. Plenty of staple gym exercises use dumbbells, and you probably already know some: bicep curls, shoulder presses, bench presses, lunges, and so on. Just hold the weights and do the exercise, no planning needed.\n\nIron is forever, but rubber degrades over time. Check the manufacturer’s directions, but most will tell you to replace your bands after a year, or for thinner bands, sometimes just a few months.\n\nThe way you use the bands can affect their lifespan. If the band rubs against its anchor point, for example, that can wear it out more quickly. (Follow manufacturers’ instructions for properly anchoring the band or attaching it to accessories.) When a band snaps, it may end up hitting you, which is why some trainers advise against moves like face pulls in which you’re pulling a band toward yourself.\n\nThis, I think, is the most important difference between bands and dumbbells. When you pick up something from the floor, you have to support its entire weight as soon as it leaves the ground. But if you’re getting the resistance from a band, the resistance will feel very light when you’re closer to the floor, and get progressively harder as you stand up with it.\n\nThis means you may be working harder than you want at the top of the lift, but not being challenged at all at the bottom. You can still work all your muscles if you choose and combine exercises appropriately, but you have to carefully choose exercises to make sure you're working every part of the range of movement. This factor means that bands aren’t a drop-in replacement for dumbbell or barbell work.\n\nPeople often start with a pair of dumbbells that come stamped with a number on one end (a five-pound pair, for example), but if you actually train with dumbbells consistently, pretty soon you’ll need more. You’ll also notice that different exercises require different weights: Something that’s challenging to curl will probably still be too light to press overhead.\n\nA way around this is to buy adjustable dumbbells. You slide plates on and off, or with the fancy (expensive) brands you place them back on their rack and select the next weight. I have some picks for good adjustable dumbbells here.\n\nYou can still outgrow adjustable dumbbells. The affordable ones that come in 40-pound sets might seem huge to you at first, but 20 pounds per hand is not that much if you’re strong. “I can always buy more of the little plates,” you’ll say to yourself, forgetting to check how much room the dumbbell handle has for little plates. Often, not much.\n\nThe bottom line is that dumbbells and resistance bands each have their pros and cons. It’s cheaper to buy several sizes of resistance bands than to buy a full lineup of dumbbells, but the bands won’t necessarily give you the same workout. This is another case where the ideal answer is probably: Why not both?",

    "fullText": "It has been 15 years since Michaela McAreavey was murdered on her honeymoon in Mauritius.\n\nIn January 2011, the 27-year-old teacher was found strangled in a bath at a hotel 12 days after her wedding to John McAreavey and, to this day, no-one has been convicted of her killing.\n\nTwo hotel workers were tried for her murder, but found not guilty in 2012.\n\nThe daughter of Mickey Harte, the legendary Tyrone All-Ireland winning manager in gaelic football, Michaela's death resonated through the island of Ireland and beyond.\n\nSpeaking on the GAA Social podcast, John opens about moving past the heartbreak and pain, but there is also a story of hope and living life with gratitude.\n\n\"I haven't been able to say it for a large chunk of my life, but I am happy and I've a lot to be happy and grateful for, and I thank God for it,\" he said.\n\nJohn McAreavey. Moving forward after Michaela. Living life as best you can.\n\nAfter meeting as students in Belfast, Michaela and John married in on 30 December 2010.\n\nHowever, tragedy would strike just 12 days later when she visited the couple's room in a luxury resort in Mauritius on her own after lunch, and she was discovered by John who raised the alarm.\n\nIn the aftermath, John, now 41, said there was shock, but there was also \"anger\" at how the authorities dealt with her death, and the lack of convictions that followed.\n\n\"I've never asked the question of, 'why did this happen to me?', I've always just felt so sorry for Michaela,\" he said.\n\n\"It's only now that I'm able to talk about it quite logically. There's still a hell of a lot of pain associated with it, but I accept that it's always going to be the case.\n\n\"I know how intense it is to live with that pain, so I've been able to find a way to manage it.\"\n\nMcAreavey, who featured for Down's senior football panel and won an All-Ireland Intermediate title with his club Tullylish in 2010, admits that \"moving on is a term that has never been comfortable for me\".\n\n\"I've said before about moving forward, and that just changes the reference around it.\n\n\"You'll never move on from something like that, you can't just let that be. You have to find a way to move forward.\n\n\"I'm still heavily involved for trying to find justice for Michaela so it's still a very active part of my life.\"\n\nFaith has played a big role in processing what had happened, and he says his relationship with God has helped him realise that \"every day is a gift\".\n\n\"Right from the moment it happened I felt that warmth and protection, and I've never felt alone too much in that way.\n\n\"A lot of that was down to Michaela, too, with the amount of faith she had in God.\n\n\"I'm someone who lives with gratitude. I can't look at it any other way because I still have so many things that are good in my life.\n\n\"Yes, I had this awful, traumatic experience. But I got to have Michaela and I got to experience her, even for a short time.\"\n\nMcAreavey says he has battled with the guilt of Michaela's death and says \"that part has always been a struggle\".\n\n\"I always believe when you are with somebody, you are there to protect them.\n\n\"You do and you have to [be pragmatic that he could not have stopped her death], it's the only way to take yourself out of it. It's something that I've had to live with and navigate through.\"\n\nWhile the search for justice in Mauritius carries on, Michaela's legacy continued in Ireland. A foundation was set up in her name, and a crowd of 20,000 attended Casement Park in Belfast for the tribute Match for Michaela, which saw All-Ireland champions Donegal play an Ulster select side.\n\nBut it was after that match, when McAreavey, who says people talking about him \"doesn't bother me\", had organised to go to Galway with his friends, that he met Tara.\n\n\"It wasn't an overly conscious decision that I was going to go and meet somebody.\n\n\"It was an emotional time, and I remember waking up on the Monday after the match for Michaela and I felt a lot lighter, something had definitely changed.\n\n\"There was lanterns at the event and it must have been during the week when I was watching it back, they went into the sky and formed the shape of a 'M'.\n\n\"I read that as Michaela saying, 'John I'm fine here and off you go, move on forward'. That was a big thing.\"\n\n\"I went to Galway and bumped into Tara, and conversation struck and off it went.\"\n\nWith the blessing of the Harte family, who McAreavey says \"are great people\", Tara and John married in 2016. They now have two children, a son and a daughter.\n\nHe adds there is now a \"bond\" with the Harte family, particularly who Mickey and Mark, Michaela's brother, who became \"really good friends\".\n\n\"When you love someone you want the best for them, and I truly believe they were happy for me. They seen the pain I was in, and it represented coming out of that pain.\n\n\"There were tears, but it was all from the right place. It's tricky to navigate, but they've all been very supportive.\"\n\nMcAreavey said Tara is \"unbelievable\" and her support has \"been paramount\" as he balances moving forward with his life while fighting his battle for Michaela.\n\n\"The time I met Tara I was still grieving, and then you are dealing with these new feelings.\n\n\"She's been thrown into this limelight. There was always so much love there, even in the times where it felt like it was too difficult, it's always come back to that.\"\n\nMcAreavey said he feels \"a sense of responsibility\" to continue to fight for Michaela 15 years on.\n\nWhile he has moved forward with other aspects of his life, he said \"there's a fight in me that I don't think that will ever go away\".\n\n\"The least you would expect it the people who are responsible would have to pay for that.\n\n\"It does seem impossible at times, but then I see other people around the world in cases that have went on for 20 or 30 years and that gives me hope.\n\n\"I truly believe if the right people have the will then they can make things happen.\"\n\nIn November, Irish Tanaiste Simon Harris said he there would be \"immediate\" engagement\" with the authorities in Mauritius having met with the McAreavey and Harte families, and John says \"I can only control what I control\".\n\n\"We've been working with the department of foreign affairs in Ireland for quite some time to engage through the diplomatic routes.\n\n\"That's where it has to be, but it's imploring them to do what they have to do. That is ongoing. It's essentially asking people to do their job.\"\n\nMcAreavey hopes there is still a possibility where the two hotel workers who were acquitted in 2012, Sandip Moneea and Avinash Treebhoowoon, could be recharged in the future.\n\nTreebhoowoon had initially confessed to the murder but plead not guilty after saying police had beaten a confession out of him.\n\nThe initial trial raised issues about the crime scene contamination which led to a lack to DNA evidence and a former suspect and key witness, Raj Theekoy, has since died, but McAreavey has not given up hope.\n\n\"There's no guarantees you would get the verdict. What we experienced was a circus, but right now that would be enough victory, to see those guys go through the mill again.\n\n\"If I focus too much on the outcome then it won't serve me well. All I can focus on is the pursuit of that justice.\"\n\nMcAreavey feels that \"how it concludes is ultimately down to me\", and his own determination for justice will keep Michaela's case in light.\n\n\"The moment I stop pursuing things, then people over there will respond in kind.\n\n\"The longer it goes on it does get challenging to see, 'where is this going?. But I feel with the right people engaged it can happen.\"",

It just wasn't to be - we started a bit slower than we wanted.\n\n\"Our group gained great experience from the tournament, for many it was their first World Cup. It's really competitive and shows the pressure elite cricketers are under.\n\n\"Those big moments, it's how you deal with them and process them.

    "description": "Carol...",
    "fullText": "US politicians flooded the summit—but Europe no longer sees the United States as a reliable partner.\n\nMunich—There was one question the kept floating around the Munich Security Conference (MSC) this year. “Will this be the last one?”\n\nThe future of “Davos with guns” has never been \n\nThis did not stop US lawmakers from making an appearance, especially Democrats, including several 2028 presidential contenders, who were eager to signal an alternative foreign policy to the one promoted by Trump. At one point, a panel attendee quipped, “It seems that Munich is the new Iowa.”\n\nAmong the Americans present were California Governor Gavin Newsom, who headlined several panels on climate change and security, Senator Mark Kelly (D-AZ), Senator Ruben Gallego (D-AZ), Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, and perhaps most notably, New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nIn her first major trip abroad, AOC stepped onto the world stage. But for a politician that has built a progressive platform on criticism of US military interventionism and domestic policies aimed at benefitting the working class, her presence at MSC, widely considered to be the biggest international annual security event in the West and a major hub for hawkish military elites, seemed at first glance out of line with her values.\n\n“I think the congresswoman shares a lot of that skepticism of traditional security institutions,” said Matt Duss, former foreign policy adviser to Bernie Sanders and an informal adviser to AOC on this trip to Germany. “But she clearly thought that there was value in coming to engage this conference, to listen, and to share a perspective that is very rarely heard at this kind of gathering.”\n\nShe and other Democrats were eager to call out Trump’s destruction of the transatlantic alliance.\n\n“They are looking to withdraw the United States from the entire world so that we can turn into an age of authoritarians that can carve out a world where Donald Trump can command the Western Hemisphere and Latin America as his personal sandbox, where Putin can saber-rattle around Europe,” she said on a panel, urging the United States to instead recommit to global humanitarian projects like the United States Agency for International Development, which Trump dismantled early upon retaking office in 2025.\n\nBut few Europeans seemed convinced that the transatlantic partnership could be fully mended.\n\n“And we, Europe,” German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said in a speech, “have ended a long break from world history,” before continuing to explain that the world order is now “openly characterized” by great-power politics.\n\nHe stopped short of writing off the United States as a partner, saying, “I understand the unease and doubt that surface in such demands. I even share some of them. And yet, these demands are not well thought-out. They simply ignore harsh geopolitical realities in Europe, and they underestimate the potential that our partnership with the United States still holds, despite all the difficulties.”\n\n“A sovereign Europe is our best answer to the new era,” he added. “Uniting and strengthening Europe is our most important task today.”\n\nThis message of Europe strengthening its military is part of a longer vision of a world order without the United States as a reliable partner. For decades, European leaders invoked “strategic autonomy” as a kind of aspirational slogan—something to be developed slowly, cautiously, without antagonizing Washington. Now it is urgent operational doctrine.\n\nPrivately, US and European officials spoke less diplomatically. One senior Democratic staff member described what was happening between the United States and Europe as a long divorce, where Vance’s message last year was one partner storming out of the room, while Rubio’s return this year was a more measured message in front of the divorce court.\n\nThis was perhaps the central paradox of the conference. Even as Democrats arrived to reassure allies that another United States still existed—one committed to alliances, multilateralism, and the liberal international order—their very presence underscored the fragility of that promise. European officials could listen politely, but they could not ignore the structural reality: US foreign policy now appeared contingent on domestic electoral outcomes in a way that made long-term planning difficult.\n\nFor AOC, this was precisely the argument for engagement. In panel discussions and smaller side events, she emphasized that US politics was not monolithic and that transatlantic relationships extended beyond any one administration. Her argument rested on the idea that alliances were not simply agreements between governments but relationships between societies.\n\n“This is a moment where we are seeing our presidential administration tear apart the transatlantic partnership,” she said. “I think one of the reasons why not just myself but many Democrats are here is because we want to tell a larger story, that what is happening is indeed very grave. And we are in a new era, domestically and globally. There are many leaders that have said, ‘We will go back,’ and I think we need to recognize that we are in a new day and a new time.”\n\n“But that does not mean that the majority of Americans are ready to walk away from a rules-based order and that we are ready to walk away from our commitment to democracy,” she said, adding, “Many of us are here to say, ‘We are ready for the next chapter,’ not to have the world turn to isolation but deepen our partnership on greater and increased commitment to integrity to our values.”\n\nYet even some sympathetic observers wondered whether such reassurances could meaningfully alter Europe’s trajectory. The momentum toward self-reliance had already begun during Trump’s first presidency, accelerated during the war in Ukraine, and now appeared irreversible.\n\nThe evidence was everywhere at MSC. Defense tech start-ups, particularly from Ukraine, made battlefield technology designed explicitly to reduce dependence on US suppliers. Panels focused on European industrial capacity, supply-chain resilience, and independent command structures. And in his speech, Merz highlighted that the German army is establishing the largest brigade in modern German history outside of its own territory, in Lithuania, as well as talks with French President Emmanuel Macron about renewed nuclear deterrence. Merz promised to “make the Bundeswehr the strongest conventional army in Europe as quickly as possible—an army that can stand its ground when it needs to.”\n\nWhat had once been framed as burden-sharing within an alliance was increasingly framed as preparation for its absence.\n\nThis shift was not purely military. It extended into energy, technology, and finance. European leaders spoke of building parallel systems that could function independently of US control—alternative payment networks, domestic semiconductor production, and sovereign cloud infrastructure.\n\nAll this said, there is little confidence that Europe can cleanly separate from the United States. US military power still underwrites Europe’s security architecture, and US intelligence remains indispensable.\n\nUnderlying these arguments was an implicit acknowledgment: The United States could no longer guarantee stability.\n\n“They see us as a wrecking ball,” Governor Newsom said, speaking to CNN’s Kacie Hunt. “They see us as unreliable, and a lot of them think it’s irrevocable. They don’t think we’ll ever come back to our original form.”\n\n“I’m not as convinced of that. Whatever happens, we can undo, we can shapeshift, we can fix it,” Newsom added, explaining that Trump was temporary.\n\nClimate change, in particular, emerged as a bridge between progressive domestic priorities and international security concerns. Panels discussed rising temperatures, migration pressures, and resource scarcity not as abstract environmental issues but as drivers of instability.\n\nThere was also recognition that the erosion of the transatlantic relationship would reshape global power dynamics far beyond Europe. China loomed large in discussions. A divided West, many warned, would weaken the collective ability to respond to Beijing’s economic and military ambitions.\n\nThe Munich Security Conference has always served as a kind of barometer of the Western alliance. During the Cold War, it was a forum for coordinating strategy against the Soviet Union. After the Cold War, it became a venue for managing the expansion of NATO and the integration of Eastern Europe.\n\nDespite the anxiety, there was little sense of imminent collapse. Institutions rarely disappear all at once. They weaken gradually, adjusting to new realities before anyone fully acknowledges what has been lost.\n\nFor decades, the Munich Security Conference served as a gathering of allies who assumed their shared future. This year, it felt increasingly like a gathering of partners preparing for uncertainty.\n\nThe conference will likely endure. But the US-led order it was built to stabilize is wobblier than ever.",

    "title": "Why LeBron James Ignores Genocide and Stands With Israel",
    "description": "Dave...",
    "fullText": "The basketball great once said he wanted to be like Muhammad Ali. He can’t do that and shrug off Israeli war crimes.\n\nTwenty-two years ago, I wrote this about a preternaturally mature 19-year-old hoops phenom named LeBron James and his aspirations off the court:\n\nJames has said he has two goals in his life. One is to be “a global icon like Muhammad Ali,” and the other is to be the richest athlete in the history of the world. And while these may be two great goals, they don’t exactly go great together. That’s because people like Muhammad Ali didn’t become global icons because they were rich, but because they were willing to sacrifice everything—including sponsorship deals—to stand up for what they believed in.\n\nIn the last two decades, we have seen how James’s desires have conflicted. During the early days of Black Lives Matter movement, he was outspoken in his support for racial justice. In 2012, he posed with his Miami Heat teammates in hoodies to protest the murder of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, and after the police killing of Eric Garner in 2014, he wore a T-shirt that said “I can’t breathe” during warm-ups alongside Cleveland Cavaliers teammate Kyrie Irving.\n\nYet over the last several years, as his fortune has exploded into the 10-figure category, James’s silence has been noticeable. Neither ICE’s killings nor the Trump regime’s relentless racism has moved him to speak forcefully. One perfect encapsulation of this untenable balancing act was in 2022 when he filed a trademark for the phrase “shut up and dribble.” When Fox News’s Laura Ingraham first bleated this at James in 2018, his supporters were enraged, and it became a rallying cry against the racism that Black athletes have long faced. Now one of James’s corporations says it will put it on items such as “downloadable virtual goods, namely, computer programs featuring footwear, clothing, headwear, eyewear, bags, sports bags, backpacks, sports equipment, art, toys and accessories for use online and in online virtual worlds.” The phrase will go from protest cry to branding exercise.\n\nThis week, the effort to balance the spirit of Muhammad Ali with his life as a 41-year-old billionaire tipped away from Ali. Actually, it didn’t just tip. It crashed to the ground. During NBA All-Star weekend, James was asked for his thoughts on Israeli All-Star Deni Avdija of the Portland Trailblazers. He took the opportunity to speak about Israel more broadly, saying, “If I have fans over there, then I hope you’ve been following my career. I hope I inspire people over there to be better in life. Hopefully someday I can make it over there. I’ve heard nothing but great things.”\n\nJames always speaks with great intentionality, and no one should think this was an off-the-cuff comment. It was a statement of support during the second year of a genocide in Gaza alongside the accelerating annexation of the West Bank. Israel has launched a project of ethnic cleansing, and James wanted the world to know that he was unbothered by it. Not only that—he seemed to want to follow in the footsteps of his good friend Draymond Green and take a propaganda trip to do public relations for the Israeli state.\n\nIf James’s defenders say that he doesn’t know what’s been happening and we shouldn’t expect more from “just an athlete,” they are being as ignorant as Ingraham. James knows what’s been going on in Gaza, and it’s ludicrous to think that he’s heard “nothing but great things” about Israel. He certainly hasn’t heard great things from his old Cavaliers running buddy Kyrie Irving, who has not been shy about showing his solidarity with the Palestinian people. He hasn’t heard great things from current and former NBA players like former teammate Dwight Howard or Tariq Abdul-Wahad or Etan Thomas and more who have spoken out against genocide and for a free Palestine. Hell, during this past weekend’s All-Star Game, Irving wore a PRESS shirt in solidarity with the journalists in Gaza killed by the Israeli army and Spike Lee wore the colors of the Palestinian flag courtside.\n\nJames knows what’s going on. Instead of fulfilling his teenage goal of being a hero to the downtrodden, he has chosen to turn his back on war crimes, permitting his fans to do the same. Perhaps he fears what a backlash will do to that other youthful dream of unfathomable wealth. Or maybe he just doesn’t care.\n\nIn contrast to James, Ali visited Palestinian refugee camps and went to Free Palestine demonstrations in the 1970s and ’80s until he was physically unable to do so. When asked why he would visit a refugee camp in Southern Lebanon, he said he had a responsibility to be there since “the United States is the stronghold of Zionism and imperialism.” Ali knew this would entail sacrifice, and he did it anyway because he both consciously and instinctively sided with the oppressed. And that’s why you can go to any outdoor market on earth today and find a knockoff Ali T-shirt for sale. That’s why he remains adored.\n\nJames came to a fork in the road and spit on the path laid by Ali before taking the path most traveled. One wonders what 19-year-old LeBron would think about his current self’s making this choice: the choice to reject Ali’s legacy and become just another billionaire stepping over Palestinian bodies to praise the Israeli state.",

It takes time. My body has been through a lot.\"\n\nWoods claimed his fifth Masters title in 2019, ending an 11-year major championship drought, and added that he had not ruled out competing at Augusta from 9-12 April.\n\nHe suffered severe leg injuries in a 2021 car crash before undergoing a back operation in September 2024 and suffering a ruptured Achilles tendon last March.\n\n\"I've had a fused back and now a disc replacement, so it's challenging,\" said the 50-year-old. \"Now I've entered a new decade so that number is starting to sink in and has us thinking about the opportunity to be able to play in a cart [on the Champions Tour].\"\n\nWoods laments slow recovery and has no return date",

    "fullText": "Japan dominated the short program in the women's figure skating at Milan-Cortina 2026 with their athletes occupying three of the top four places following the short program.\n\nAmi Nakai, 17, stormed to the top of the leaderboard with a season-best score of 78.71.\n\nShe is followed by three-time world champion Kaori Sakamoto, while compatriot Mone Chiba - who won bronze at last year's worlds - is in fourth.\n\nThey took advantage of errors by the fancied Americans, with reigning world champion Alysa Liu third and Amber Glenn well down the field.\n\nLiu, with her immediately recognisable halo hair and lip piercing, took the roof off the arena as her routine was acclaimed by spectators ranging from team-mate Ilia Malinin to rap icon Snoop Dogg.\n\nHowever, she lost points on her triple lutz for landing on the quarter – not fully completing the rotation, instead returning to the ice 90 degrees short.\n\nAmerican champion Glenn meanwhile suffered a disaster as she missed her triple loop – meaning it was scored as an invalid element, thus scoring zero points for that element.\n\nGlenn, 26, burst into tears as she exited the rink. She is 13th in the standings and knows her medal hopes are over.\n\nAdeliia Petrosian, the Russian champion competing as an Individual Neutral Athlete (AIN), is in fifth place.\n\nTeam GB's Kristen Spours - in her final event before injury-enforced retirement - finished 29th.\n\nThe Woking-born skater misses out on the free skate, with the top 24 progressing to the medals decider on Thursday evening.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nSo far, none of the AIN representatives, who come from countries which have been banned from competing at the 2026 Olympics, have won a medal.\n\nThe most likely candidate to change that is 18-year-old Petrosian, the Russian national champion.\n\nThe teenager is under the tutelage of controversial Eteri Tutberidze - the coach of Kamila Valieva at the last Olympics, and whose involvement with the Georgia figure skating team helped win the country's first ever Winter Olympic medal with pairs silver last night.\n\nShe was not listed as a coach for Petrosian on the official start list, and when receiving her score the teenager was only accompanied by listed coach Daniil Gleikhengauz - who has previously worked closely with Tutberidze.\n\nWearing a sparkling red jacket and black trousers, she had plenty of fans in Milan carrying banners bearing her face. However when she was first introduced in the rink there was a smattering of boos - unusual for figure skating.\n\nPetrosian has not been able to compete internationally because of the ban on Russian athletes by the International Skating Union, so this was a fascinating look at her on the global stage for the first time.\n\nAnd performing to a Michael Jackson medley, she lived up to the hype and showed her medal credentials with a spotless routine including an excelled triple flip and toe loop.\n\nIt earned her a season-best score of 72.89, and at the end of the routine her fans pelted the ice soft toys as a sign of appreciation.\n\nOne of the Jackson songs was They Don't Care About Us - possibly a pointed selection, given the focus on her presence at these Games.\n\nFor much of last year, it seemed very unlikely that British champion Spours would compete at these Games.\n\nThe 25-year-old had disc herniation surgery last June and announced in September that she was taking a break to prioritise her physical and mental health.\n\nBut that break helped her rediscover her love of the sport, and she skated here in one final performance before retirement.\n\nSpours was at a firm disadvantage as her injury left her unable to perform a double axel, one of the key elements of the short program. The element requires pressure through the left leg, something she is unable to do without the risk of falling and aggravating her back.\n\nAnd afterwards she revealed she had been nervous going into the event, leading to an early error on her loop element.\n\n\"I'm a little bit disappointed with my mistake on the day,\" she said. \"That is usually something that I can do in my sleep but it happens. I was more nervous today than I was coming into the team event so I'm happy.\"\n\nBut she entered the rink with a big smile and a peace sign to camera, and after scoring 45.54, could leave figure skating with her head held high.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Trent Alexander-Arnold said the alleged racist abuse of team-mate Vinicius Junior during Real Madrid's Champions League match at Benfica was a \"disgrace to football\", while opposition manager Jose Mourinho was criticised for his comments on the incident.\n\nThe match was halted for 10 minutes after Vinicius reported alleged racist abuse by Benfica's Gianluca Prestianni to referee Francois Letexier, and he and his team-mates temporarily left the field.\n\nThe Brazil forward, who has been the victim of numerous incidents of racist abuse during his playing career, said \"Racists are, above all, cowards\" in a post on his Instagram.\n\nBenfica manager Mourinho claimed Vinicius did not \"celebrate in a respectful way\" after his stunning goal in the 1-0 win preceded the incident at the Estadio da Luz.\n\nThe former Real Madrid and Chelsea boss said: \"There is something wrong because it happens in every stadium.\n\n\"A stadium where Vinicius plays something happens, always.\"\n\nReacting to Mourinho's comments, former Real Madrid midfielder Clarence Seedorf said on Amazon Prime: \"I think he is still emotional. I think he made a big mistake today to justify racial abuse.\n\n\"He's saying it's OK, when Vinicius provokes you, to be racist - and I think that is very wrong.\n\n\"We should never, ever justify racial abuse. Vinicius has had enough of that unjustified behaviour from people. I know Mourinho by heart would agree with me but he expressed himself a bit unfortunately, I believe.\"\n\nEngland international Alexander-Arnold condemned the incident in his post-match interview.\n\n\"I think what has happened tonight is a disgrace to football and overshadowed the performance, as well as an amazing goal,\" said Alexander-Arnold.\n\n\"Vini has been subject to this a few times throughout his career. To ruin a night like this for our team is a disgrace.\n\n\"There is no place for it in football or society. It is disgusting.\"\n\nMourinho was seen speaking with Vinicius after the 25-year-old took the decision to walk off the pitch following the interaction with Prestianni.\n\nThe Portuguese said in his post-match interview that he was told different things by Vinicius and Prestianni regarding the incident.\n\nIn addition to expressing his belief that Vinicius had been disrespectful with his celebration, he pointed to the club's legendary striker Eusebio as proof that Benfica is not a racist club.\n\nAsked if he felt Vinicius incited the crowd, Mourinho said: \"Yes. I believe so.\n\n\"It should be the crazy moment of the game, an amazing goal. Unfortunately [he was] not just happy to score that astonishing goal. When you score a goal like that, you celebrate in a respectful way.\"\n\nHe added: \"I told [Vinicius], when you score a goal like that you just celebrate and walk back. When he was arguing about racism, I told him the biggest person in the history of this club was black.\n\n\"This club, the last thing that it is, is racist. If in his mind there was something in relation to that, this is Benfica.\n\n\"They [Vinicius and Prestianni] told me different things. But I don't believe in one or another. I want to be an independent.\"\n\nSpeaking after watching Mourinho's interview, former England international Theo Walcott said on Amazon Prime: \"I am quite calm and composed and I am not someone who gets angry often.\n\n\"I love everything Jose Mourinho has done in football but I think he has made a poor decision in that sense. It was maybe the one time we shouldn't have heard from him, the one night he should not have been in front of the cameras.\"\n\nVinicius' Real Madrid team-mate Kylian Mbappe called for Argentina winger Prestianni to no longer be allowed to play in the Champions League following the alleged incident.\n\n\"Nothing like this has ever happened to me, and in these kinds of important matters, it's important to speak very clearly and not to speak in generalities,\" France forward Mbappe said.\n\n\"I have the utmost respect for Benfica and their coach, who is one of the best in history and who made history with Real Madrid. But, in my opinion, this player doesn't deserve to play in the Champions League anymore.\n\n\"We cannot accept that a player who plays in Europe's top competition behaves like this. This guy doesn't deserve to play in the Champions League anymore, but we'll see what happens.\n\n\"Let's leave it to Uefa, who always try to do something. Now they have a serious case, and I hope they do something.\"\n\nWith the two clubs set to meet for the second leg in Madrid next Wednesday, Walcott called for urgent action by Uefa.\n\n\"It's something that cannot be done in months and months, it needs to be dealt with immediately,\" Walcott said.\n\nFormer Arsenal striker Thierry Henry, speaking on CBS, reflected on his own experiences of racist abuse during his playing career.\n\n\"I can relate to what Vinicius Junior is going through. That happened to me so many times on the field. At times you feel lonely because it's going to be your word against his word, because we don't know what he has said,\" Henry said.\n\n\"He put his shirt over his mouth. Clearly, already, he looks suspicious because he didn't want people to see what he said.\n\n\"Let's see how big of a man Prestianni is – tell us what you said.\"\n\nReal Madrid tie halted over Vinicius racism allegation\n\nVinicius' brilliant winner beats Benfica in game halted for alleged racism",

    "fullText": "Real Madrid's Champions League knockout phase play-off tie at Benfica was halted for 10 minutes after Vinicius Junior reported alleged racist abuse and he and his team-mates left the field.\n\nReferee Francois Letexier made the crossed arms gesture to signal racist abuse following a conversation with Vinicius.\n\nThe Brazil forward had put the Spanish visitors 1-0 up in the second half at the Estadio da Luz, before being booked for an excessive celebration.\n\nFollowing an interaction with Benfica's Gianluca Prestianni, Vinicius ran over to referee Letexier while gesturing towards the opposition player.\n\nA Real Madrid statement said Vinicius told the referee he had been racially abused by the Argentina winger.\n\nVinicius then walked off the pitch and was followed by his Real Madrid team-mates, but play restarted 10 minutes later, in the 60th minute.\n\nThe match was played out to its conclusion, with Real winning 1-0 after 12 minutes of stoppage time, during which an object thrown from the crowd struck Vinicius on the arm.\n\nAfter the match, Vinicius released a statement on Instagram condemning the incident.\n\n\"Racists are, above all, cowards. They need to put their shirts in their mouths to show how weak they are,\" said Vinicius.\n\n\"But they have the protection of others who, theoretically, have an obligation to punish them. Nothing that happened today is new in my life or in my team's life.\n\n\"I received a yellow card for celebrating a goal. I still don't understand why. On the other hand, it was just a poorly executed protocol that served no purpose.\"\n\nBenfica forward Vangelis Pavlidis defended team-mate Prestianni.\n\n\"I don't think Prestianni said anything like that to Vinicius. I think it has more to do with the heated rivalry between Brazil and Argentina than anything else,\" he said.\n\nMourinho's 'big mistake' after 'disgusting' Vinicius incident\n\nVinicius' brilliant winner beats Benfica in game halted for alleged racism\n\nA statement from the Brazilian Football Confederation read: \"Racism is a crime. It is unacceptable. It cannot exist in football or anywhere else.\"\n\n\"Vini, you are not alone. Your decision to activate the protocol is an example of courage and dignity. We are proud of you.\n\n\"We will remain steadfast in the fight against all forms of discrimination. We stand by your side. Always.\"\n\nThe crossed-arms gesture to signal racist abuse was introduced by Fifa in May 2024.\n\nIt is made by an on-field referee if they observe or receive a report of abuse.\n\nObjects were seen being thrown from the crowd as Vinicius, 25, danced by the corner flag after scoring a stunning goal in the 50th minute.\n\nThat sparked a disagreement between the players on the pitch, following which Vinicius and Prestianni were seen interacting on the halfway line.\n\nThe Real star led his team-mates off the pitch after reporting the incident and spoke with Benfica manager Jose Mourinho as staff members from both sides became involved.\n\nVinicius has been the victim of numerous incidents of racist abuse during his playing career.\n\nFive people were handed suspended prison sentences for racially abusing him last year – the first time that a conviction for racism at a football match in Spain has been handed out.\n\nUefa established a three-step racism protocol to handle incidents of discrimination inside stadiums in 2009.\n\nIt is designed to give referees the power to halt or even abandon matches if racist behaviour continues.\n\nIf the referee becomes aware of a racist incident, they will:\n\nStop the match. If the incident involves members of the crowd, an announcement will be made over the public address system calling for any racist behaviour to stop.\n\nIf it continues, the game is stopped for five to 10 minutes and the players will be taken off the pitch while another announcement is made.\n\nIf it resumes after the second restart, the referee can abandon the game.\n\nA match will only be abandoned once the security of the players and public has been assessed. The case is then referred to Uefa's disciplinary authorities.\n\n20 September 2022 - Atletico Madrid condemn \"unacceptable\" chants by a \"minority\" of fans towards Vinicius outside their stadium before a La Liga derby with Real Madrid.\n\n26 January 2023 - La Liga says it \"strongly condemns acts of hatred and intimidation against Vinicius Jr\" after an effigy of him was hung from a bridge near the club's training ground. Four men are fined 60,000 euros (£51,700) and given a two-year stadium ban for the act.\n\n21 May 2023 - Vinicius suffers racist abuse at Valencia but is sent off for violent conduct in the 97th minute after an altercation with striker Hugo Duro. Earlier in the game, an incensed Vinicius attempts to bring Valencia fans to the referee's attention.\n\n22 May 2023 - Real Madrid file the incident to the Spanish prosecutor's office as a hate crime.\n\n19 March 2024 - Real Madrid file complaint after referee Juan Martinez Munuera omits alleged racist abuse allegations from fans towards Vinicius in his report after the club's match against Osasuna.\n\n25 March 2024 - Vinicius says he feels \"less and less\" like playing football because of the repeated racist abuse he has suffered.\n\n10 June 2024 - Vinicius says he is a \"tormentor of racists\" after three Valencia fans are sentenced to eight months in prison for abusing him at a match in May 2023.\n\n29 November 2024 - Real Madrid hand a minor a one-year stadium ban and fine for racially abusing Vinicius during the club's match against Rayo Vallecano the previous season.\n\n21 May 2025 - Five people are handed suspended prison sentences for racially abusing Vinicius in an \"unprecedented\" ruling in Spain. The incident occurred during Real Madrid's match against Real Valladolid in September 2022.\n\n17 February 2026 - Real Madrid's Champions League knockout phase play-off tie at Benfica is halted for 10 minutes after Vinicius and his team-mates leave the field.",

    "fullText": "Six Russian and four Belarusian athletes will compete under their nations' flags at the upcoming Winter Paralympics.\n\nIn September, the International Paralympic Committee lifted its ban on athletes from the two countries competing at the Games.\n\nBoth countries were suspended from Paralympic competition after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, with Belarus a close ally of Russia. A partial ban - allowing athletes to compete as neutrals - was introduced in 2023.\n\nHowever, the four individual governing bodies in charge of the six sports contested at the Paralympics decided to keep their bans in place.\n\nIn December, Russia and Belarus won an appeal against FIS - the governing body for skiing and snowboarding - at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas), permitting them to compete and accumulate ranking points.\n\nThe IPC confirmed to BBC Sport that the 10 athletes have been awarded bipartite commission invitations to compete in Para-alpine skiing, Para-cross country skiing and Para-snowboarding at the Milan-Cortina Games.\n\n\"The IPC can confirm that NPC Russia has been awarded a total of six slots: two in Para-alpine skiing (one male, one female), two in Para-cross country skiing (one male, one female), and two in Para-snowboard (both male),\" it said in a statement.\n\n\"NPC Belarus has been awarded four slots in total, all in cross-country skiing (one male and three female).\"\n\nCulture Secretary Lisa Nandy said it was \"completely the wrong decision\".\n\n\"Allowing athletes from Russia and Belarus to compete under their own flags while the brutal invasion of Ukraine continues sends a terrible message,\" Nandy wrote on X.\n\n\"The International Paralympic Committee should reconsider this decision urgently.\"\n\nBipartite commission invites are granted to individual athletes, rather than their international federation, and allow the participation of top athletes \"who may not have had the opportunity to qualify through other methods due to extraordinary circumstances\", among other factors.\n\nUkraine has also been awarded bipartite slots in three sports.\n\nIt will mark the first time a Russian flag has been flown at a Paralympic Games since the Sochi 2014 Games, firstly due to the country's state-sponsored doping programme, before the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nRussian news agency TASS reports that among the athletes set to compete are Aleksey Bugaev, a three-time Paralympic champion in alpine skiing, and cross-country skiers Ivan Golubkov and Anastasiia Bagiian - both are World Championship medallists.\n\nAll three returned to competition in January, and both Bugaev and Bagiian have since won World Cup titles.\n\nThe Milan-Cortina Winter Paralympics will take place from 6-15 March.",

    "fullText": "Team GB's Winter Olympics curling medal hopes are now in serious jeopardy after Bruce Mouat's world champions were beaten 9-5 by Canada in Cortina.\n\nArriving in Italy as gold-medal favourites, the British quartet have lost four of their eight matches in a round-robin stage full of maybes and might have beens.\n\nNow, they must beat the United States in their final game on Wednesday (13:05 GMT) - and hope either Italy or Norway fail to win both their closing games, against the Canadians and the unbeaten Swiss - to reach Thursday's semi-finals and salvage their podium prospects.\n\nThe 2022 silver medallists have spoken all week of playing well, but coming out on the wrong side of the narrow margins. And that was the case again against their great rivals high in the Dolomites.\n\nA shot here and a shot there was the difference, as Canada kept their shape better in the big moments and confirmed their own progress.\n\n\"That wasn't a game where we played well,\" vice-skip Grant Hardie told BBC Sport. \"We made too many mistakes and we're running out of time to put it right.\n\n\"I think we can deliver the right result tomorrow and hopefully get into the semis.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nMouat's rink have an excellent record against Brad Jacobs' team, and beat them in the last four of the worlds last spring.\n\nBut the Canadians knew they could improve their own chances - and inflict a little revenge - and they started strongly, opening a 3-1 lead after three ends.\n\nThe British team are considered the world's best, though, and righted themselves. Capitalising on a slight drop off by their opponents, they took two themselves in the fourth and another two in the sixth to lead with four to play.\n\nHowever, the clank of granite went against them in the seventh, an unfortunate bounce leaving Canada the chance of three, which they gladly took.\n\nMouat and his team needed to respond. They couldn't. Instead, they gave up a steal to leave themselves with a three-point deficit with two ends to play.\n\nIt was a deficit that they could not overcome. And now, their aspirations of upgrading their silver medal from Beijing are no longer in their own hands.\n\nGB's women are also in a perilous position, and also must beat the United States on Wednesday (08:05), as well as Japan later in the day (18:05) and Italy on Thursday (13:05) if they are to scrape into the last four.\n\nTeam GB finished 12th in the two-man bobsleigh after brakeman Taylor Lawrence withdrew from the final two runs and was replaced by Leon Greenwood.\n\nA statement from Team GB said that Lawrence, who missed several World Cup races last season because of a calf injury, sat out the race as a \"precautionary measure\" in preparation for the four-man event that begins later this week.\n\nGreenwood, making his Olympic debut, and pilot Brad Hall clocked 55.72 seconds and 56.17secs to give them a combined overall time of 3:43:43.\n\nIt was a disappointing showing from Hall, who is GB's most decorated men's bobsleigh pilot in World Cup history with 30 race medals.\n\n\"It wasn't plan A but with Leon [Greenwood] coming in last minute, we wanted to keep Taylor [Lawrence] safe, ready for the four-man,\" Hall told BBC Sport.\n\n\"We knew we were out of contention for the two-man so we just used it as extra training runs for the four-man.\"\n\nIt was a German clean sweep on the podium as Johannes Lochner and Georg Fleischhauer won gold while legendary pilot Francesco Friedrich and Alexander Schuller took silver with Adam Ammour and Alexander Schaller bronze.\n\nThe four-man event begins on Saturday with the medal-deciding runs on Sunday.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",
