    "fullText": "Hawks’ 2 best trade upgrade options using Kristaps Porzingis’ $30.7 million expiring contract appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nThe Atlanta Hawks are nowhere near where they envisioned they would be heading into the 2025-26 campaign. This past offseason, they were very aggressive, bringing in Kristaps Porzingis and Nickeil Alexander-Walker via trade and free agency, respectively, to try and make the leap in the wide-open Eastern Conference. But instead of taking the leap, they’ve stayed very much mediocre as they head into Christmas Day with a 15-16 record amid their current four-game losing skid.\n\nThere is plenty of talent on the Hawks’ roster, but somehow, they haven’t put it together quite yet this season. Their offseason additions, which were supposed to elevate Atlanta defensively, haven’t made the impact they were expected to.\n\nOn the season, they rank 18th in defensive rating, allowing 115.6 points per 100 possessions, and since Trae Young returned from injury on the 18th of December, they’ve allowed 125.8 points per 100 — good for third-worst in the NBA during that span.\n\nSuffice to say, the Hawks may be feeling a sense of urgency to be aggressive on the trade market considering their present circumstances. Porzingis is dealing with further complications brought forth by his Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), leaving Atlanta with just Onyeka Okongwu at center.\n\nIf Atlanta is indeed feeling the heat, desperation could very well push them to trade Porzingis away to acquire another center. The uncertainty surrounding the Latvian big man may become untenable for a Hawks side that wants to be one of the best teams in the East, and with his contract set to expire at the end of this current campaign, he will be an piece to take on for teams looking to free up salary.\n\nWith that said, here are three trade options the Hawks could pursue amid Porzingis’ bout with injury.\n\nHawks acquire: Myles Turner, Andre Jackson Jr.\n\nBucks acquire: Kristaps Porzingis, 2026 SAS first-round pick\n\nThe Hawks’ vision was clear when they acquired Porzingis in the trade that saw them give up Terance Mann, Georges Niang, and a 2025 first-round pick (Drake Powell). With Clint Capela departing in free agency, a spot opened up in their center rotation. Porzingis emerged as a perfect fit alongside Jalen Johnson in the frontcourt; Johnson is a slasher who can finish well on the interior, while Porzingis loves letting it fly from beyond the arc. And with Young handling the offense, Atlanta was sure to feast.\n\nPorzingis also provides more rim protection than Okongwu thanks to his length (he stands at 7’2″ with a 7’6″ wingspan), and Atlanta needed a tone-setter on the defensive end considering how average they’ve been on that end of the floor over the past few seasons.\n\nAlas, rolling the dice on Porzingis was always going to be a risk. He’s already been injury-prone enough over his entire career, but a mystery illness kept him out of the Boston Celtics’ lineup way too often for their liking during last season’s playoffs and sapped him of productivity whenever he was on the court.\n\nThat mystery illness was diagnosed later on as POTS, and now, Porzingis is dealing with its effects and is unable to suit up on the basketball court. As much as he would want to produce for the Hawks (and he’s been very productive when healthy), his body is not allowing him to — forcing Atlanta into making some very tough decisions.\n\nThe player archetype the Hawks want at center is very clear. They want a floor-spacer who can block shots consistently. And as luck would have it, a player of that ilk may become available on the trade market in Myles Turner.\n\nTurner, who signed a four-year, $108.9 million contract with the Milwaukee Bucks this past offseason, has struggled in his first season away from Indianapolis. His numbers are down across the board, and considering the total cost the Bucks paid to sign him (waiving and stretching Damian Lillard’s contract), he has played at a level way below expectations, not at all coming close to being the piece Milwaukee needed to make a convincing case for Giannis Antetokounmpo to pledge his future to the city.\n\nIt’s going to be a tough pill for the Bucks to swallow that their signing of Turner was a mistake, but they can rectify that by trading him away for Porzingis’ expiring contract while getting a first-round pick for their troubles.\n\nNow, the Hawks owe the San Antonio Spurs a pick swap next year courtesy of the Dejounte Murray trade. That pick of theirs will most likely land in the late first round. To that end, Atlanta should be very comfortable trading away a late-first round pick for a 3-and-D center with plenty of experience doing damage alongside a talented playmaker.\n\nThe Bucks, meanwhile, get a chance to clean the books and try again in free agency next year. They have a 12-18 record on the season, and with Antetokounmpo still not on the comeback trail, it could make sense for them to do this and get a first-round pick in return.\n\nHawks acquire: Ivica Zubac, Bogdan Bogdanovic\n\nClippers acquire: Kristaps Porzingis, 2026 ATL first-round pick (SAS own swap rights with ATL), 2027 ATL first-round pick swap (LAC receives more favorable of less favorable pick between ATL and NOP and less favorable of LAC/DEN/OKC picks), 2028 ATL first-round pick, 2029 ATL first-round pick swap\n\nTrading away two first-round picks and two pick swaps for Ivica Zubac doesn’t seem very smart for the Hawks to do. For starters, Zubac is currently out with an ankle sprain and is going to be on the mend for multiple weeks. Moreover, it’s not like Atlanta is a piece away from winning a title; they’re 15-16 at the moment and are very much struggling.\n\nBut Zubac solves a lot of the Hawks’ problems. For starters, Zubac has been known to anchor an elite defense in the past for the Clippers. Sure, LA’s defense has been very bad this year, but that can be attributed as much to their woeful perimeter defense as it can be to any form of decline from the 28-year-old center.\n\nZubac is also a more traditional pick-and-roll dance partner for Young, someone who can feast off of dimes from the Hawks’ star point guard. Capela was a lob threat who can protect the rim; Zubac is similar in that respect, but he’s different in that he has better touch from the interior and can even be given the ball in the post — his hook shot is near-automatic from point-blank range.\n\nThe Hawks, for giving the Clippers pick swap options and unprotected first-round picks for Zubac, will also be getting a familiar face back in Bogdan Bogdanovic. Bogdanovic adds another ballhandler and shooter for Atlanta off the bench, and his contract will be expiring in 2026 so he won’t be on the books for long.\n\nThe Clippers will then be getting an opportunity to begin their process of starting over, arming themselves with more future draft picks. They have been also playing noticeably better as of late; perhaps having a stretch five would be the way to go for them moving forward. To that end, if Porzingis were ever to be healthy, he could be a huge help for LA in their quest to at least rescue a play-in tournament spot after a ghastly start to the 2025-26 campaign.\n\nThis, however, is an unlikely swing for the Hawks to make. Young is presumably going to be entering free agency at season’s end (he has a player option for the 2026-27 campaign worth $48.97 million), which clouds Atlanta’s future with so much uncertainty. But this could be a worthwhile swing if they were truly hellbent on making it work with Young at the controls.",

Curry spent 13 seasons as one half of the infamous “Splash Brothers” duo, alongside Thompson. The 3-point chucking pair helped lead the Warriors to four championships in seven seasons.\n\nCurry rocking Thompson’s signature shoes is a fitting way to pay homage to his former teammate, while playing against him, as The Dallas Morning News’ Mike Curtis noted.\n\n“Didn’t notice this until now, but sneaker free agent Stephen Curry is wearing Klay Thompson’s shoes by ANTA,” Curtis reported.\n\nDidn’t notice this until now, but sneaker free agent Stephen Curry is wearing Klay Thompson’s shoes by ANTA. pic.twitter.com/Ih0F69O5wn\n\n— Mike Curtis (@MikeACurtis2) December 25, 2025\n\nCurry became the 22nd player in NBA history to score 26,000+ points in his career in the third quarter of the Warriors’ 10-point win against the Mavs.\n\n26,000 CAREER POINTS FOR STEPH CURRY!\n\nThe 22nd player in NBA history to reach that mark 🤩 pic.twitter.com/JBX4zU0UiA\n\nCurry finished with 23 points on 6-of-18 shooting and a perfect 9-for-9 from the free-throw line. He also finished with four assists and three rebounds. Klay Thompson scored seven points on 3-of-8 attempts off the bench, two rebounds, two assists, one steal, and one block for the Mavs.\n\nMavericks rookie Cooper Flagg impressed Warriors All-Star Stephen Curry with his game-high 27-point performance in Thursday’s Christmas Day matchup. Flagg, who has participated in Curry’s basketball camp before entering the NBA, went 13-of-21 from the floor and finished with six rebounds, five assists, and one block in his first matchup against Steph and the Warriors.\n\nAfter the game, in his walk-off interview, Curry discussed what he sees in Flagg’s future, per NBA on ESPN’s X (formerly Twitter).\n\n“Just a true hooper. Competitor. You forget how young he is — just his presence out there on the court,” Curry said. “So, the future is bright. I’m glad he got this experience in his first year to understand what the bright lights feel like. The league is in good hands.”\n\n\"Just a true hooper.

    "description": "Will the Magic emerge as the winner in the Coby White sweepstakes with trade rumors involving the Bulls guard growing louder and louder?",
    "fullText": "Magic trade proposal to Bulls adds Coby White to talented young core appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nThe Orlando Magic made it clear this past offseason that they were looking forward to taking the next step in their road to contention. They traded away a king’s ransom of future draft picks to bring in Desmond Bane, hoping that he’ll be the shooter the team has sorely needed amid their struggles on the offensive end over the past few seasons.\n\nBut it’s become evident that Orlando needs more than just Bane to take advantage of their opportunity in the wide-open Eastern Conference. The injury bug has not been kind once more to the Magic, as the likes of Paolo Banchero, Franz Wagner, and Jalen Suggs — their three franchise guys — have all missed time. In fact, Wagner is out for a few more weeks at the minimum, while Suggs has been dealing with a hip injury over the past few weeks.\n\nThis may push the Magic to pull off a trade to bolster the team further, and they have reportedly been linked to a potential trade for Chicago Bulls guard Coby White. White is in the final year of his contract, and with Chicago treading on the line of mediocrity yet again, this could be the year where they decide to cash out on White as a trade asset.\n\nHowever, the Bane trade has depleted Orlando’s trade assets, making them unfavored in any trade scenario for White. Nonetheless, here is a trade proposal that could convince Chicago to give them their explosive scoring guard.\n\nMagic acquire: Coby White, Jevon Carter\n\nBulls acquire: Jonathan Isaac, Jett Howard, 2026 DET/MIL second-round pick, 2027 ORL second-round pick, 2028 ORL second-round pick\n\nThe Magic have loved Jonathan Isaac since day one, and it’s not hard to see why. Isaac, when healthy, is one of the best defensive players in the NBA. He’s capable of guarding everyone from one to five, and that description isn’t hyperbole. He can indeed slide his feet even against quicker guards, and he can protect the rim and even stand toe to toe with post-up brutes.\n\nBut Isaac has lost so much developmental steam throughout his career due to injuries, and the Magic team seems to have outgrown him already. And Orlando, of all teams, would know just how much care there must be to prevent Isaac from suffering another long-term injury. Fans have to remember that Isaac missed two full seasons (2020-21 and 2021-22 seasons) and played just 11 games during the 2022-23 campaign.\n\nNonetheless, the Magic know how elite he is on defense, even though he cannot log heavy minutes anymore due to his injury history. Thus, inking him to a five-year, $84 million contract made sense at the time (mid-2024).\n\nHowever, in today’s CBA landscape, the bill comes due quite quickly for teams on the rise. Suggs, the 2021 draftee, was signed to a five-year, $150.5 million deal. Wagner, another 2021 draftee, signed a stunning supermax contract over five years that could be worth as much as $270 million. And then there’s Banchero, the first overall pick of 2022. He’s the Magic’s franchise player, so doing anything other than inking him to a five-year, $239 million deal would have been asinine.\n\nAdding Bane, who signed a five-year, $207 million deal with the Memphis Grizzlies back in 2023, has further complicated cap matters for the Magic. Those four players alone will be making a combined estimate of around $156 million.\n\nTime is ticking on the Magic, and Isaac appears likely to give way in a cap-saving maneuver. To that end, Orlando may as well get a quality player in return and target White, someone who can provide a scoring punch from the perimeter to aid the cause for them amid Wagner and Suggs’ injuries.\n\nIt is unlikely that White stays in Orlando long-term considering the Magic’s clogged cap sheet situation, but ClutchPoints NBA insider Brett Siegel did mention that the Magic “would be willing to move on from Jonathan Isaac and second-round assets to add scoring depth”. White would be nothing more than a rental, but if Orlando were to trade him eventually anyway, they shouldn’t just do so for the sake of clearing future cap obligations.\n\nThe Magic have been starting Anthony Black and Tyus Jones in the backcourt amid Wagner and Suggs’ injuries. Black has been good all year and has been making a third-year leap, but Jones, at this point, is better-suited to being a backup point guard. His inconsistency can be very infuriating, and his plus-minus numbers have been bad all year. According to PBP Stats, the Magic’s net rating this season is worse by 13 points whenever Jones is on the floor.\n\nThat is not exactly an ideal situation for a Magic team that’s looking to compete for a title this year. White is not going to be the piece that takes them over the top, but he’s an incredible depth piece to have, an excellent sixth man for when Orlando gets back its core players, and acquiring his Bird rights means that they at least open themselves up to the possibility of retaining White as a trade asset.\n\nAs for the Bulls, this trade is an admission that their current core is not good enough and that White is a legitimate flight risk considering that he’s in the final year of his contract. Chicago has hovered in and around the play-in spots over the past few seasons, and losing yet another quality piece for nothing is not going to aid their cause in their ongoing rebuild.\n\nAlas, this return won’t (and shouldn’t) be enough for the Bulls. They will at least want one first-round pick in any White trade, especially when White is just 25 years of age and has proven himself to be one of the best scoring machines in the NBA, having tallied 21.4 points per game thus far this season.\n\nIsaac could be a good defensive piece for a team starved of them, Jett Howard could become something, a post-hype breakout wing, while three second-round picks are nothing to scoff at. But in the end, the Magic simply may not have enough assets to entice the Bulls to trade White to Orlando. That doesn’t mean that they shouldn’t try anymore.",

    "fullText": "SAN ANGELO, Texas (Concho Valley Homepage) — Click the video above to relive the Wall Hawks’ road to the 2025 state championship.\n\nIf there’s one team in the Concho Valley enjoying its 2025 holiday season, it’s the Wall Hawks. The school brought home its first-ever football state title one week ago, but this year’s championship run didn’t come as a surprise to many people.\n\nKLST Sports Director Charles Bryce had a vision. During KLST and KSAN’s 2025 High School Football Preview Show on Aug 20, he said “I can’t wait to see some of these teams that have a really good shot at winning a state championship. Let’s see who can bring one home to the Concho Valley this year.”\n\nBryce’s preseason analysis aged very well. Four months later, Wall stood tall as the Concho Valley’s lone state champion. Wall’s second-year head coach Craig Slaughter also had a vision this season, and his squad’s road to glory was in the works for years.\n\n“It still probably hasn’t sunk in, [I’m] just proud,” Slaughter said. “[I’ve gotten] so many texts from people that have followed our program for a long time. We’ve been chasing it for a long time, we’ve been in the hunt for a long time and that’s before I got here. This program has been knocking on the door for a while and it’s awesome to get that done.”\n\nWhen Slaughter became head coach in 2024, he guided the Hawks to the Class 3A Division II State Semifinals which resulted in a heartbreaking 42-32 loss to the Gunter Tigers. That loss served as motivation for players and coaches heading into the next season. One year later, Wall got its revenge with a 28-25 state semis win over Gunter.\n\n“We knew how to handle ourselves much better,” Hawks senior right tackle Will Aldridge said. “On the sidelines, you could tell we weren’t out of this game. We still had a lot more football to play, and I think a big part of it was just that maturity level.”\n\n‘We’re a fourth quarter type of team,” Hawks senior running back Brady Neal said. “We’re very physical, we’ve got good chemistry. Even though we were down, we knew that just one play could get us back in it.”\n\nIn the ensuing state championship game versus the Newton Eagles, Wall’s commanding 25-8 halftime lead proved to be just enough to secure the win. The Hawks survived the Eagles’ second-half comeback attempt, which fell one point short as Wall held on to win 25-24.\n\n“I can’t give enough credit to our kids,” coach Slaughter said. “Their composure is awesome. They just keep playing, and they found themselves a state championship.”\n\nWall’s season-defining theme revolved around talent and depth. The Hawks’ stacked roster featured 23 seniors, giving them the edge over opponents in terms of experience.\n\n“Ours wasn’t just 23 players,” coach Slaughter said. “There were 23 leaders, strong kids, and just a talented roster. Some of the kids were waiting in line for reps for us, and it just speaks to the depth of that squad.”\n\nAfter many years of knocking on the doorstep, the Wall Hawks can finally call themselves state champions. This 2025 championship team will be remembered for many years to come.",

It was tough to dwindle down the top ten stories of 2025 but we did our best.\n\nTop story #10 – 2025 was a banner year for Mt. Pleasants Debbie Antonelli, literally. In January the NC State alum was inducted into the Wolfpack basketball Ring of Honor for her contributions to the sport. On Halloween the town of Mt.

    "fullText": "The Denver Broncos once again played down to their competition against a Kansas City Chiefs team forced to play its third-string quarterback, but the Broncos somehow managed to overcome their struggles to win, 20-13 in a problematic game that once agains exposed their limitations.\n\nThis game was defined by four long Denver drives, one in each quarter. The first two came up short to produce a pair of Wil Lutz field goals, with gave the Chiefs a chance to hang around and counter with a touchdown on a short drive after a Bo Nix interception to make the score 7-6 at halftime.\n\nThe Chiefs actually scored first in the third quarter after a pass interference penalty on Broncos cornerback Pat Surtain II gave KC the ball in Denver territory, which led to a 53-yard field goal by Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker that made it 10-6.\n\nThe Broncos proceeded to drive the field again, and this time Nix was able to finish by running the ball in from nine yards out for Denver’s first touchdown of the night. That gave the Broncos the lead, 13-10, but the Chiefs were able to counter with yet another Butker field goal from 47 yards after a 44-yard punt return by running back Brashard Smith.\n\nDenver’s final drive of the game was the fourth one to last for at least 14 plays, and Nix finished the 65-yard effort with a one-yard touchdown pass to running back RJ Harvey. The key play in the drive was a defensive offside penalty by Chiefs tackle Chris Jones that gave Denver a critical red-zone first down that led to the score.,\n\nThe Broncos were lucky to win this one, and Kansas City’s last-ditch scoring attempt featured some receiving heroics from Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. But a final pass to receiver Hollywood Brown in the end zone in the final seconds ended up bing an overthrow that allowed Denver to survive.\n\nNix was decidedly mediocre, producing just 182 yards passing as he went 26-for-38, and his longest throw of the night went for just 10 yards. The Broncos also struggled to run the ball effectively for most of the night, and it was this combination that allowed the Chiefs to stay within striking distance.\n\nThe Denver defense did what it had to do against third-string Chiefs quarterback Chris Oladokun, but there were some scary moments when bad tackling in the secondary once again nearly cost them. Oladokun passed for just 66 yards on the night as he went 13-for-22, but the fact that the Chiefs were in this one at all was mostly a testimony to the Broncos’ ongoing struggles.\n\nThe win gave Denver the pole position in the race for the top seed in the AFC, but it’s hard to imagine the Broncos making a deep playoff run given their lack of a running game and Nix’s ongoing issues with inconsistency. There’s a lot to fix before their final game against the Los Angeles Chargers, and that game will be for the AFC West title if the Chargers can defeat the Houston Texans on Saturday.\n\nThe Chiefs played valiantly given their offensive limitations and the fact that this game was meaningless for them, and they’ll wrap up their broken season with a road game against the Las Vegas Raiders that promises to feature some ugly football given where both teams are right now.",

    "fullText": "WICHITA, Kan. (KSNW) — From the moment they hit the gridiron, Mike and Blake Bell were inseparable.\n\nFor two identical twin brothers, a bond could be centered around anything, but for the Bell boys it was always football.\n\nFor nearly their entire lives, they were on the same team. In high school both attended Bishop Carroll, in college they both played for Colorado State, but on draft day things took a turn. Taken second overall by the Chiefs, Mike made Mark a promise.\n\n“The sports information guy said I needed to get over to Kansas City, and I told them, I wasn’t leaving until Mark got drafted,” said Mike Bell.\n\nAfter three rounds, Mark eventually got drafted in the fourth. In a time crunch, Mike would have to leave for Kansas City, but on the way there, he quickly learned that Mark was taken by an AFC West rival.\n\nMaize senior shooting guard leads by example on and off the field\n\n“I’m flying to Kansas City, and as I’m getting off the plane, the pilot comes out and says, I just wanna let you know they radioed up and your brother got drafted to the Seahawks,” said Mike Bell.\n\nThe two faced off twice a year on the opposite side of the ball, with Mike eventually getting the best of Mark in their NFL debut.\n\n“The first play wasn’t that good for me,” Mark said laughingly. “We had some really great memories, though. My mom and dad and the whole family would bring a bus down to Arrowhead to come watch us play, it was really special.”\n\nAnd with all of those great memories, come a legacy that the two brothers will share forever.\n\n“They remember us as the football guys, even though we’ve done different things since then, it’s amazing how that kind of follows you and it just goes with you for your whole life,” said Mike Bell.\n\nFor more Kansas news, click here.

    "description": "‘Heated Rivalry’ director Jacob Tierney talks hockey culture, the NHL’s response, and why Ilya and Shane have drawn new eyes to the sport.",
    "fullText": "Heated Rivalry has inspired watch parties, fan edits, and a level of obsession usually reserved for playoff runs. It has also found its way into NHL buildings.\n\nFor director Jacob Tierney, that response raises a bigger question: Can a TV show from Canada — adapted from Rachel Reid’s Game Changer book series with the help of HBO — help hockey reach beyond its usual audience? Now that the finale at the cottage has aired, it seems clear the answer is yes.\n\nTierney suspected he had bronchitis when he spoke to USA TODAY’s For The Win and was on antibiotics, the result of a nonstop press tour promoting the show’s occasionally spicy queer hockey romance centered on the magnetic Shane Hollander and Ilya Rozanov, played by Hudson Williams and Connor Storrie.\n\nMore: 'Heated Rivalry' stars, sexuality rumors and what we can learn\n\nThe show has grown so big that the NHL released a statement addressing its impact and influence (via The Hollywood Reporter):\n\n“There are so many ways to get hooked on hockey and, in the NHL’s 108-year history, this might be the most unique driver for creating new fans. See you all at the rink.”\n\nThat surge in popularity has also meant that Williams and Storrie have gone from virtually unknown to overnight stars.\n\n“I’m just happy it’s working. I’m delighted,” Tierney told For The Win. “People seem to like it, and that’s what matters.”\n\nFans have gathered in sports bars to watch the show’s biggest moments as if they were Stanley Cup games — and they’ve noticed everything. That includes Easter eggs ranging from Hollander’s heartbeat matching Rozanov’s jersey number to needle drops timed perfectly to pivotal plot points.\n\n“Honestly, people have noticed everything — things I didn’t even consciously put in,” Tierney said. “I’ve never felt so observed in my life.”\n\nSome of those songs from the soundtrack, like \"I'll Believe in Anything\" and \"All the Things She Said\" have massively spiked with listeners.\n\nFor The Win caught up with Tierney to discuss the viral series, its breakout stars Williams and Storrie, co-star François Arnaud, the soundtrack fueling the show’s momentum, and the NHL and Montreal Canadiens — also known as the Habs.\n\nFans can watch the first season of Heated Rivalry, which was recently renewed for a second season, on HBO Max.\n\nThis interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nMore: Andrew Scott surprises 'Heated Rivalry' star in sweet podcast moment\n\nTierney: I’ve been doing this a long time. I knew we had something really good, but that doesn’t always matter. There’s so much noise now — so much TV, so much content. I knew we had a good show, and once HBO picked it up, I knew we had a fighting chance to get noticed. But everything that’s happened since has been completely insane. I never could have predicted any of this.\n\nWe were never going to cast stars in these roles. That was always the idea. I think romance as a genre is often better served by lesser-known actors, because the audience can really project onto the characters rather than a pre-existing persona. With something like this, it was important that they could just be Ilya and Shane — not bring other baggage into it. The level of alchemy has been wild. We definitely didn’t anticipate anything like this.\n\nTierney: It’s a great question. I think you have to wait and see what these things actually do. But it’s incredibly cool that someone in the Bruins organization and someone with the Habs are clearly really into it and keep playing our songs. That’s [expletive] amazing.\n\nI’m born and raised in Montreal — the Habs are a religion where I’m from — so every time they show our trailer playing on the Jumbotron, it’s so [expletive] cool.\n\nI hope what the NHL said yesterday is sincere, that they really are valuing new eyes and the new air that comes with that. Hockey is a sport I love deeply, but it doesn’t always reach beyond its core fan base. I think it could use a little crack, a little oxygen getting in there.\n\nThe NHL seems to function like the Catholic Church in terms of its insularity. People say that with Habs all the time: Only the Habs do pageantry better than the Catholic Church.\n\nThere’s a stoicism to hockey, a desire for this monolithic image, and I think the sport can survive a lot more than that. I don’t imagine a culture shift but even if it’s just moving an inch to the left, I don’t think that’s a bad thing. Ultimately, the bigger the audience, the better for the sport.\n\nRachel Reid and I are huge hockey fans. This show is a love letter to hockey in its own way. It was never made to slight the sport — that’s just not true.\n\nTierney: I have a friend who said to me recently: “Do people know that the soundtrack is just a playlist you made in 2008?” Fair enough. These are just songs that I love that speak to me.\n\nI’ve been a Wolf Parade fan since their first EP. With Feist, I grew up with Broken Social Scene and that whole explosion of Canadian music, which was incredibly meaningful to me. I love music, and I’m always looking for new stuff too — whether it’s Wet Leg or whatever connects with me now.\n\nIf a song moves me, and it works with the images, hopefully it moves other people too. The reaction to the music has been really rewarding. Wolf Parade actually sent me a lovely note yesterday — they were really happy. And “I’ll Believe in Anything” is an anthem and it deserves all the attention it’s getting. It’s an amazing song.\n\nTierney: You’re already seeing shifts with younger players being aware of their own mental health and trying to take care of yourself. The NHL has made some good efforts, like the Player Assistance Program. There is a desire there.\n\nA lot of traditionally masculine cultures struggle with allowing people to say things out loud. Not every bit of vulnerability has to be presented behind closed doors. You can be vulnerable and still have the mental and physical toughness required to be a professional athlete.\n\nIf anything, vulnerability is attractive. It’s not harmful, and it’s good for your mental health.\n\nTierney: I don’t think it changes that much. I’ve always described this as a workplace romance — hockey is their workplace. I love hockey, but I wanted to make a show where you don’t need to understand icing to follow the story. It’s about rivalry and competition, about winning and losing.\n\nSomeone tweeted that they were glad the hockey “fades to black” on Heated Rivalry, which made me laugh because that’s usually how sex is treated.\n\nThere actually is a fair amount of hockey in the show, and our hockey coordinator did a [expletive] great job. It looks good.\n\nBut this was never going to be a show where you get an episode that’s just a full game. That’s not happening. Hockey is still the beating heart of the show, though — and you’ll definitely get more of it in the second season.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: Heated Rivalry director Jacob Tierney on Ilya and Shane, hockey fans",

    "fullText": "Travis Kelce walked off the field at Arrowhead Stadium with a smile Thursday night, seemingly in good spirits. While we still don’t know if that was it for him at the stadium in Kansas City, and the 20-13 loss to the Denver Broncos wasn’t the best way to go out, Kelce still got plenty of love from Chiefs fans on his way out the door.\n\nKelce’s mom, Donna, and his fiancée, Taylor Swift, were in attendance, too. The walk back to the locker room this time felt different.\n\nTravis Kelce walks off the field after his last home game of the season 🫶 @tkelce | @chiefs pic.twitter.com/5keiEj8Hvu\n\n“You only get a few of those where you just get to stand there and appreciate 60-70,000 Chiefs fans screaming for you,” Kelce said in his postgame news conference. “I always embrace that moment, man. It’s fun. Hopefully I got everybody fired up for it.”\n\nKelce has spent his entire career with the Chiefs, who selected him in the third round of the 2013 NFL Draft out of Cincinnati. He quickly became a fan favorite and played an integral part of the Chiefs’ dynastic run and their three Super Bowl wins. His public relationship with Swift has only skyrocketed his fame over the past several years.\n\nThe 11-time Pro Bowler is closing in on 13,000 career receiving yards and has 82 touchdowns on 1,077 catches over his 13 seasons in the league. All three of those figures are the most in franchise history. He had five catches for 36 yards Thursday night.\n\nBut at 36, Kelce is undoubtedly nearing the end of his career. There has been plenty of speculation that he may retire at the end of the season, especially considering the Chiefs are going to miss the playoffs for the first time since Kelce’s second season in the league. Quarterback Patrick Mahomes is recovering from an ACL and LCL injury he suffered earlier this month, making the start of next season unclear.\n\nIf Kelce were to retire after this season, which would mark the end of an era for the franchise that has dominated the league in recent years, Thursday’s game would be his final one at home. He's at the end of a two-year, $34.25 million deal with the team and would become a free agent in the coming months.\n\nKelce declined to give much clarity on the speculation postgame.\n\n“Honestly, I’ve been just focused on trying to win football games, man,” Kelce said about retirement. “I’ll let that be a decision that I make with my family, friends, the Chiefs organization when the time comes.”\n\nThe Chiefs will take on the Las Vegas Raiders next weekend to wrap up their season. Based on Kelce’s comments Thursday night, we won’t have an answer on his future until after that.\n\nBut if this was the end, considering the circumstances, Kelce sure took advantage of his final moments at Arrowhead.",

But for head coach JJ Redick, the ultimate reason for the team’s recent stretch can be summed up in four simple words.\n\n“We don’t care enough,” Redick said following the Lakers’ Christmas Day loss to the Rockets. “And that’s the part that bothers me a lot. We don’t care enough to do the things that are necessary, and we don’t care enough to be a professional. We had it, we had it. I always say this about culture, I always say this about a good team being a functioning organism, it can change like that. We don’t have it right now.”\n\nFrom the opening tip, the Lakers were a step slower than the Rockets on both ends of the court. They found themselves trailing by double digits early in the first quarter, 18-8, and by the end of the period they were down 37-25.\n\nIt was still a double digit deficit at halftime, and the second half didn’t get any better with the Rockets’ lead ballooning to 20 points almost midway through the third quarter. The Lakers couldn’t rebound, they couldn’t get stops and they couldn’t string together enough consistency offensively. To make matters worse, Austin Reaves was ruled out for the second half due to his ongoing calf injury. In the first half, Reaves had been the only consistent offensive threat for the team.\n\nJJ Redick didn’t hold back words when summing up what kind of team the Lakers are right now, while acknowledging that he told the team postgame to expect an uncomfortable practice this weekend.\n\n“The two words of the day were effort and execution. I feel like when we’ve done both those things at a high level, we’ve been a good basketball team,” Redick said. “When we haven’t, we’re a terrible basketball team, and tonight we were a terrible basketball team. That started legitimately right away.”\n\nThe Lakers were outrebounded by the Rockets, 48-25. They allowed 24 second chance points compared to their 10, and 16 fastbreak points compared to their 11.\n\nTuesday’s loss against the Phoenix Suns was the first time this season that the Lakers had lost consecutive games. Redick had vowed that the Lakers would have the right mentality on Christmas, but that was not the case. The Lakers’ next opportunity to get back in the win column is Sunday, Dec. 28 as the Sacramento Kings come to town.",

    "fullText": "Los Angeles Lakers head coach JJ Redick was not in a charitable mood after the team’s 119-96 loss to the Houston Rockets on Christmas Day.\n\nThe team took its third straight loss Thursday in a one-sided affair, an outcome made worse by rising star Austin Reaves exiting the game with another calf injury. The Rockets led by double-digits for the entire second half and outrebounded the Lakers 48-25.\n\nAfter the game, Redick railed against his team’s effort level and bluntly assessed how it performed:\n\n“The two words of the day were ‘effort’ and ‘execution.’ I feel like when we’ve done both of those things at a high level, we’ve been a good basketball team. When we haven’t, we’re a terrible basketball team. And tonight, we were a terrible basketball team.”\n\nHe went on to note the team’s next practice Saturday will not be a fun one for certain players, whose consistency he is directly questioning:\n\n“We don’t care enough right now. That’s the part that bothers me a lot. We don’t care enough to do the things that are necessary. We don’t care enough to be professional.\n\nIt’s a matter of making the choice, and too often we have guys that don’t want to make that choice. It’s pretty consistent who those guys are. Saturday’s practice, I told the guys, it’s going to be uncomfortable. Meeting is going to be uncomfortable. I’m not doing another 53 games like this.”\n\nThat choice calls back to what Redick said after the Lakers’ previous loss to the Phoenix Suns, in which he painted the team’s defensive effort as a series of choices it wasn’t making correctly.\n\nHis full postgame conference Thursday:\n\nJJ Redick went scorched earth on the Lakers postgame. pic.twitter.com/ZLuOKyqMBQ\n\n— Arash Markazi (@ArashMarkazi) December 26, 2025\n\nThe Lakers have spent nearly the entire season on solid footing despite LeBron James’ early season absence, but now sit at 19-10, good for only fifth place in the Western Conference. The team can only hope Reaves isn’t further injured after missing three games last week with a calf strain, but it has other problems to figure out now.\n\nThe Lakers’ next chance to get back on track will be a Sunday home game against the Sacramento Kings, who currently hold the worst record in the West at 7-23.",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES — Something has to change with the Lakers.\n\nThat was the feeling most Lakers fans had as they exited Crypto.com Arena early on Christmas, hoping to beat traffic after a third straight blowout loss. It was a sentiment echoed loudly by Lakers coach JJ Redick after the final buzzer and one likely to be shared by general manager Rob Pelinka soon enough.\n\n“We don’t care enough right now,” Redick said. “That’s the part that bothers you a lot. We don’t care enough to do the things that are necessary. We don’t care enough to be professional. We don’t care enough to be professional.”\n\n“It’s a matter of making the choice, and far too often we don’t have guys who want to make that choice,” Redick added while previewing the team’s next practice. “And it’s pretty consistent who those guys are. Saturday’s practice, I told the guys, is going to be uncomfortable. The meeting is going to be uncomfortable. I’m not doing another 53 games like this.”\n\nJJ Redick went scorched earth on the Lakers postgame. pic.twitter.com/ZLuOKyqMBQ\n\n— Arash Markazi (@ArashMarkazi) December 26, 2025\n\nFor a franchise that entered the season believing it had solved its championship formula, Christmas offered a brutal reality check.\n\nThe NBA trade deadline is February 5, 2026 — 41 days from the moment the Lakers exited the court Thursday following a 119–96 loss to the Houston Rockets. It marked their longest losing streak of the season, a stunning reversal for a team that hadn’t even lost consecutive games before last Saturday.\n\nThat night, the Clippers handed them a 103–88 loss. On Tuesday, the Phoenix Suns obliterated them 132–88. On Thursday, the Rockets delivered the third punch of a six-day stretch that has reframed the Lakers’ season and exposed their ceiling.\n\nThis is not a championship team as currently constructed.\n\nYes, they started 15–4 and looked like a contender through 19 games. But as Stan Van Gundy told me at the NBA Cup, numbers eventually win every argument.\n\n“I don’t think they’re a true contender, in my opinion,” Van Gundy said  “Their numbers said they were mediocre. Their record said they were really good. I just don’t think in today’s game they have enough.”\n\n“They don’t have the depth, they don’t have the speed and quickness to keep up right now,” Van Gundy continued. “Defensively, they even get weaker when their three best players play together.”\n\nHe was referring to the Lakers’ high-usage trio — Luka Dončić, LeBron James, and Austin Reaves — a combination that has repeatedly failed to defend young, fast, perimeter-driven teams. Against Houston, those stars once again shared the floor alongside starters Deandre Ayton and Rui Hachimura. The result was predictable.\n\nThe Lakers’ starting lineup was a -14 in just over eight minutes in the first half with a defensive rating of 144.4. Entering the game, that unit posted a 113 offensive rating, 122 defensive rating, and a -9 net rating this season.\n\n“When they had the mix of two of those guys (they were better).” Van Gundy said of the Lakers when they played without one of their stars. “Now JJ will obviously rotate those guys, but they’re going to come down the stretch in games, and those three guys are all going to be out there and Ayton will be out there and now you can’t get perimeter defenders out there with them. I think it’s a struggle and JJ and his staff have a huge challenge in front of them.”\n\nJames' Rich Paul said it first when he claimed the Lakers weren't a contender on his podcast two weeks ago. Van Gundy validated it. And the last 72 hours have cemented it.\n\nThe Lakers are 19–10 — fifth in the West, just ahead of the Rockets and the Suns, two teams that dismantled them. National hype can cloak flaws for only so long. The Lakers’ fatal flaw is now their defining one:\n\nThey cannot defend young, fast teams, and no team wins in the postseason giving up 120 points a night.\n\nThe Lakers don’t need another superstar. They have that box checked with Dončić. They still get All-NBA moments from LeBron. They’ll likely send Reaves to his first All-Star Game. But stars without an identity — without depth, speed, or defensive toughness — are just names on a marquee, not threats in a playoff series.\n\n“I can’t picture them on OKC’s level,” Van Gundy said. “Denver, San Antonio, Houston are probably the next three teams, and I don’t see the Lakers at that level.”\n\nThe good news? There’s still time for Pelinka to fix what ails them. The bad news? Time is the only thing they have. And if urgency, pride, and professionalism don’t arrive soon, it won’t matter who sits in uncomfortable practices or who speaks into a microphone next.\n\nThe Lakers’ biggest issue isn’t schematic, roster-based, or philosophical.\n\nIt’s effort. It’s identity. It’s caring enough.\n\nAnd right now, they simply don’t.",

    "description": "Here are three reasons why the Lakers were thrashed on Christmas Day.",
    "fullText": "The Houston Rockets celebrated Christmas in style, delivering an overwhelming and dominant outing in a 119-96 thrashing of the Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday.\n\nAmen Thompson led six Rockets in double figures with 26 points in the win, which ended a brutal six-game road trip — three overtime losses plus a 20-point blowout at the hands of the woeful Clippers — on a strong note to improve to 18-10 on the season. Luka Dončić scored a team-high 25 points for the Lakers, but also committed six of their 16 turnovers in a game L.A. never led, and in which Dončić, LeBron James and Co. only briefly even appeared competitive.\n\nHere are three takeaways from the Rockets’ commanding performance at Crypto.com Arena:\n\nAfter consecutive blowout losses to the Clippers and Suns, L.A. head coach JJ Redick offered a curt reply to an inquiry as to whether his Lakers — who entered Christmas ranked 25th in defensive efficiency — had shown enough of a willingness to dig in and grind it out on the less glamorous end of the floor:\n\nReporter: \"Does this group have enough guys who make the choice to play hard (like many guys on Phoenix eg. Goodwin)?\"\n\nJJ Redick: \"No.\"\n\n— Lakers Daily (@LakersDailyCom) December 24, 2025\n\nL.A. brought a similar flavor of indifference for much of its Christmas Day matchup with Houston. The Lakers repeatedly allowed Rockets ball-handlers to beat them at the point of attack, get into the paint and generate good look after good look, seemingly whenever and wherever they wanted:\n\nAmen Thompson with the speedy layup and then the Alley-oop dunk off a lob by Alperen Sengun (with a replay) pic.twitter.com/bVKRE8aCr0\n\n— MrBuckBuck (@MrBuckBuckNBA) December 26, 2025\n\nHouston barely needed five minutes of game time to build a double-figure lead that it would never relinquish, ending the opening frame with 37 points on 24 possessions — a torrid 154.2 offensive rating. For reference, the best offense in the NBA, the Denver Nuggets, scores 125.6 points-per-100.\n\n“The two words of the day were ‘effort’ and ‘execution,’” Redick said after the game. “I feel like when we’ve done both of those things at a high level, we’ve been a good basketball team, and when we haven’t, we’re a terrible basketball team. And tonight, we were a terrible basketball team. And that started, legitimately, right away.”\n\nWhen the Lakers briefly made a push midway through the second quarter, cutting the deficit to four at 48-44 following 3-pointers by Dončić and Jarred Vanderbilt, the Rockets calmly stuck to their guns, scored 15 points in the next three minutes and pushed the lead back to 10 at halftime. After the Rockets opened the third quarter with buckets on four straight possessions, Redick shifted tactics and dialed up a zone, which resulted in a pair of stops … which Houston promptly rendered irrelevant by grabbing offensive rebounds, scoring second-chance points and extending its lead even further.\n\nRedick rifled through his Rolodex in search of different combinations that might offer a level of physicality and defensive activity that could short-circuit Houston’s smoothly operating machine. The combo of Vanderbilt and Marcus Smart helped key an 11-4 second-quarter run that constituted L.A.’s best basketball of the night; a unit flanking Dončić and whisper-quiet center Deandre Ayton with Vanderbilt, Smart, gap-plugging connector Jake LaRavia (one that had played just 10 possessions together all season prior to Thursday) showed intermittent sparks.\n\nFor the most part, though, the Lakers’ Christmas fizzle looked remarkably similar to their Emirates NBA Cup quarterfinals loss to the San Antonio Spurs: a team top-heavy with scoring skill but light on size, athleticism and defensive steel proving unable — or unwilling — to hang with a younger, stronger, more physical and more relentless opponent.\n\n“We don’t care enough right now,” Redick said. “That’s the part that bothers you a lot. We don’t care enough to, like, do the things that are necessary. We don’t care enough to be a professional. We had it. We had it. I always say this about culture, I always say this about a team being a functioning organism: It can change like that. We don’t have it right now.”\n\nWhat the Lakers do have, in Dončić, James and Austin Reaves (who sat out the second half with what the Lakers called left calf soreness, a worrying note considering he just missed three games with a calf strain) is enough high-end scoring and playmaking to produce a top-flight offense. If they can’t provide a higher class of resistance against similarly skilled opponents, though, that won’t be enough — especially not if the goal is to make a deep postseason run in this Western Conference.\n\n“It’s a matter of making the choice, and too often, we have guys who don’t want to make that choice,” Redick said. “And it’s pretty consistent who those guys are. I told the guys: Saturday’s practice is going to be uncomfortable. The meeting is going to be uncomfortable. I’m not doing another 53 games like this.”\n\nComing into Christmas Day, the Rockets were the NBA’s sixth-best team at winning the possession battle on a night-to-night basis, according to analysis by Jared Dubin at Last Night in Basketball, averaging three more offensive trips per game than their opponents. They pressed that advantage early and often Thursday, pulling down four offensive rebounds against some lackadaisical Lakers boxouts and forcing six turnovers in the first quarter alone.\n\nThat allowed them to take five more shots than L.A. in the opening stanza — a key factor in the Rockets opening that early double-digit lead and keeping the Lakers at arm’s length.\n\n17 offensive rebounds for Houston — an obscene 55.6% offensive rebounding rate, per @cleantheglass — and 24 second-chance points. The Rockets do this to everybody, but the defensive rebounding just wasn't even close to good enough for the Lakers. pic.twitter.com/kGMysOf9Nr\n\n— Dan Devine (@YourManDevine) December 26, 2025\n\nThe Rockets finished with nearly as many offensive rebounds (17) as the Lakers had defensive rebounds (18) and monster edges in second-chance points (24-10), points off turnovers (23-11), points scored per possession in transition (1.33 to 1.13) and total field-goal attempts (90-77). Getting that many more bites at the apple, and capitalizing on them so effectively, is how the Rockets can shrug off 25 from Luka and the Lakers shooting 50.6% as a team overall — and how a Houston team that takes fewer 3-pointers per game than any other squad in the NBA can still boast one of the league’s most potent and efficient attacks.\n\nWhen they’re at their best, the Rockets come at you in waves on the offensive end. It’s Thompson (26 points on 12-for-19 shooting with five assists) repeatedly getting downhill into the paint, and Alperen Şengün (14 points, 12 rebounds, four assists) meanspiritedly pirouetting his way into all manner of infuriating flip shots and needle-threading drop-offs, and Kevin Durant (25 points on 8-for-14 shooting, eight assists) barely seeming to break a sweat as he gets to his preferred spots in the midrange or pops a trail 3 in an unsuspecting defender’s eye.\n\nWhen they’re really scary, it’s because those headliners have help: Jabari Smith Jr. (16 points on nine shots) drilling jumpers spotting up and running off pindowns, Reed Sheppard (13 points, 5-for-10 from the floor) snaking the pick-and-roll to get to CP3-style elbow pull-ups in rhythm, and Tari Eason — an absolute menace on both ends of the court, just fully Grinching it up — ripping and running and terrorizing.\n\n7 quick points for Tari Eason pic.twitter.com/rsnFfX1BBL\n\n— MrBuckBuck (@MrBuckBuckNBA) December 26, 2025\n\nAmen Thompson with the alley-oop dunk off a lob by Kevin Durant to put the Rockets up 22 (with replays) pic.twitter.com/25gOMqUmrY\n\n— MrBuckBuck (@MrBuckBuckNBA) December 26, 2025\n\nOn some nights, the lack of a proper half-court organizer of a point guard will rear its ugly head; on others, though, the sheer tonnage of Houston’s athleticism, ferocity and talent will dispense with any such concerns. On those nights, these Rockets can straight up run you out of your gym. Ask the Lakers. They can tell you all about it.",

Dunleavy thinks the Warriors have plenty of depth.\n\n\"These guys can come in when they need to and play five, six minutes, and be really productive for us,\" Dunleavy said. \"I think you've got to build a team this day and age that has depth.\"\n\nDunleavy is confident the Warriors will make their playoff push when head coach Steve Kerr finds a consistent rotation of players.\n\n\"We've got a good, deep roster,\" Dunleavy said. \"We'd like to find some consistency here.

    "fullText": "Give credit to the Kansas City Chiefs defense, and to tight end Travis Kelce—they both came to play, and as a result the Chiefs were nearly able to pull off an improbable upset against the Denver Broncos, but the Chiefs’ offensive limitations ultimately resulted in a 20-13 loss.\n\nThis game was defined by four long Denver drives, one in each quarter. The first two came up short to produce a pair of Wil Lutz field goals, with gave the Chiefs a chance to hang around and counter with a touchdown on a short drive after a Bo Nix interception to make the score 7-6 at halftime.\n\nThe TD came on a 4-yard pass to running back Brashard Smith, and it was the first career touchdown bass for the Chiefs third-string quarterback, Chris Oladokun.\n\nThe Chiefs actually scored first in the third quarter after a pass interference penalty on Broncos cornerback Pat Surtain II in Denver territory led to a 53-yard field goal by Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker that made it 10-6.\n\nThe Broncos proceeded to drive the field again, and this time Nix was able to finish by running the ball in from nine yards out for Denver’s first touchdown of the night. That gave the Broncos the lead, 13-10, but the Chiefs were able to counter with yet another Butker field goal from 47 yards after a 44-yard punt return by Smith.\n\nDenver’s final drive of the game was the fourth one to last for at least 14 plays, and Nix finished the 65-yard effort with a one-yard touchdown pass to running back RJ Harvey. The key play in the drive was a defensive offside penalty by Chiefs tackle Chris Jones that gave Denver a critical red-zone first down that led to the score.\n\nIt’s remarkable that the Chiefs were even able to give themselves a chance in this one. Oladokun passed for just 66 yards on the night as he went 13-for-22, although he did remain turnover-free. The running game had some moments as the Chiefs were able to pick up some occasional first downs, but Kansas City was simply outgunned in this one due to their quarterback injury issues.\n\nThe highlight of the night for the Chiefs was the final drive, which featured some receiving highlights from Kelce, who put Kansas City on his back and nearly win the game single-handed. Kelce was eventually double-teamed, though, and a final pass to receiver Hollywood Brown in the end zone wound up being an overthrow tight as Denver survived.\n\nThe Broncos will move on to play the Los Angeles Chargers for the AFC West title next week, assuming the Chargers can beat the Houston Texans on Saturday. That will officially end the Chiefs’ run of division titles at nine, while the Chiefs will close out their broken season against the Las Vegas Raiders in Week 18.",

    "fullText": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — If Thursday night was the last game Travis Kelce played inside Arrowhead Stadium, he sure tried to make it a memorable one.\n\nThe Chiefs tight end only had five catches for 36 yards against Denver, playing alongside third-string quarterback Chris Oladokun while his good buddy Patrick Mahomes and backup Gardner Minshew were out with knee injuries. But several of those catches came in the closing minutes, nearly rallying Kansas City in what would have been a stunning upset of the Broncos.\n\nKelce and Co. wound up losing 20-13 in a game in which they were nearly two-touchdown underdogs.\n\nBut it was a gutsy display by him in a career filled with them.\n\nThe four-time All-Pro, who is expected to announce soon after the season whether he is retiring, could have hung up the cleats a couple of weeks ago, when the reigning AFC champions were eliminated from playoff contention for the first time in a decade.\n\nInstead, after going to five Super Bowls — including the last three — and winning three championship rings, the 36-year-old Kelce showed that he had too much pride to quit on a lost season. He played in a humiliating loss to lowly Tennessee last week, and he was one of the few bright spots Thursday night for an offense that finished with 139 yards in all.\n\n“A whole lot of emotions,” Kelce said afterward. “You've got everybody in the world watching you. You get to go out there with the young guys on primetime television. Young guys getting an opportunity to taste what this NFL life is like.”\n\n“I’ll let that be a decision I’ll make with my family, friends, the Chiefs organization when the time comes,” Kelce said.\n\nHe was the final player introduced Thursday night, following Oladokun out of the tunnel in the corner of Arrowhead Stadium. As red lights flashed across the field, Kelce emerged from the fog with his signature bow-and-arrow entrance gesture toward a festive holiday crowd, and it predictably roared in delight — perhaps for the last time — as No. 87 took the field.\n\n“You only get a few of those (moments) where you get to stand there and appreciate 60, 70-thousand Chiefs fans cheering for you,” Kelce said. “I always embrace that moment.”\n\nIn a suite high above, his fiancee, pop star Taylor Swift, watched him perform. So did Mahomes and Minshew, who took in the game together from a suite; Mahomes tore ligaments in his knee two weeks ago, Minshew did the same last week.\n\n“You feel the generations of happiness and the love that (the fans) have,” Kelce said. \"It’s a beautiful thing, man. It’s something I know I’ll cherish forever, whether it’s coming out of the tunnel or just making a big play for them. That’s why we love Arrowhead.”\n\nKelce has played 97 games inside the stadium over the course of a 13-year career. He caught 645 passes there, including playoffs, the third-most by any player inside a single stadium behind Jerry Rice and Larry Fitzgerald since the AFL-NFL merger.\n\nNow, the question is whether Kelce will play next week in the Chiefs' season finale in Las Vegas.\n\nHe needs just 10 yards receiving to reach 13,000 for his career, and he could extend his franchise record — and the longest active streak in the NFL — by catching a pass in his 191st game next weekend. He could also go out with a win, rather than having lost five straight and seven of his last eight games, which is the slide the Chiefs find themselves on now.\n\nOr, maybe he will surprise everyone and come back for one more year.\n\n“We've been through so much together,” Chiefs defensive tackle Chris Jones said, making his desire clear. \"Just one more (season). Just one more.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers’ losing streak continued with an NBA Christmas Day slate loss against the Houston Rockets.\n\nWith an opportunity to prove they are one of the top contenders in the Western Conference on the primetime stage, the Lakers fell flat. Shortly after the game wrapped up, the outspoken former NBA veteran Kendrick Perkins offered the Lakers a piece of his mind.\n\n“Again, the Rockets exposed what we already knew that the Lakers are horrible defensively and it starts with Luka,” Perkins wrote on social media.\n\n“He gave no effort defensively tonight and went back to his old ways of complaining to the officials all damn game.”\n\nAgain the Rockets exposed what we already knew that the Lakers are horrible defensively and it starts with Luka. He gave no effort defensively tonight and went back to his old ways of complaining to the officials all damn game.\n\n— Kendrick Perkins (@KendrickPerkins) December 26, 2025\n\nDoncic checked in for 34 minutes of action on Thursday night. He went 9-17 from the field and attempted seven shots from the charity stripe. Doncic scored a game-high of 25 points, while coming down with five rebounds, and producing seven assists.\n\nHe also turned the ball over six times, more than any other player involved, and finished the game as a minus-25.\n\nThe Lakers were blown out with a score of 119-96. With that loss, they dropped to three straight defeats. Now, the Lakers are 19-10 on the year, slipping to fifth in the Western Conference standings. The victory for Houston allowed the Rockets to pull within half a game of the Lakers.\n\nDoncic and the Lakers aren’t in panic mode, but it’s clear that the coaching staff is growing frustrated with the team’s lack of execution, especially on the defensive end. It’s something that JJ Redick shined a light on earlier this week after the Lakers lost to the Phoenix Suns.\n\nOn Thursday night, Redick surely didn’t hold back. After Doncic and the Lakers get a day off on Friday, they’ll be back on the practice court for what Redick describes as an “uncomfortable” practice and film session. The Lakers will get a chance to bounce back against the struggling Sacramento Kings on Sunday.\n\nBetween the public pressure from analysts such as Perkins—and the brutally honest assessment from Redick—Doncic and the Lakers have a lot riding on them over the next couple of days. A comfortable win over the Kings could help them get back on the right track. Soon, the hoops world will see how the Lakers respond.",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES --- The effort and overall execution were nonexistent for the Los Angeles Lakers on Christmas Day, losing to the Houston Rockets 119-96 for Los Angeles' third straight loss, the highest losing streak of the season.\n\nThe Lakers have now lost three straight games for the first time this season, two of the losses being by over 20 points, as they drop to 19-10 with a fifth-place position standing in the West.\n\nCoach JJ Redick didn't hold back how he felt toward the team's lack of execution in the 23-point loss, a defeat that saw the Lakers give up 17 offensive rebounds that resulted in 24 second-chance points and not lead for a single moment of the game.\n\n“It’s because we don't care enough right now. That's the part that bothers me a lot. We don't care enough to do the things that are necessary. We don't care enough to be professionals,\" Redick said.\n\n\"The two words of the day were 'effort' and 'execution.' I feel like when we've done both of those things at a high level, we've been a good basketball team. When we haven’t, we're a terrible basketball team and tonight we were a terrible basketball team.\"\n\nThe Lakers immediately were on their heels to start the game, down double-digits and committing five turnovers within the first five minutes.\n\nThe Rockets' offense was clicking against a Lakers defense that couldn't find a stop in a stop-sign-making warehouse, with Houston hitting 10 of their first 16 shots and consistently crashing the paint for second-chance opportunities.\n\nThe Lakers got their closest within four points toward the end of the second quarter but Houston kept their push and closed the door shut the rest of the way (their biggest lead being 24) behind six Rockets finishing in double figures, with Kevin Durant (25 points) and Amen Thompson (26 points, seven rebounds, five assists) leading the way.\n\nLuka Dončić, who finished the game with 25 points (seven assists, five rebounds), showed he was a shell of himself in his return after missing L.A.'s last game. His return was welcomed by the Rockets pressuring him and trying to speed him up constantly 94 feet, scoring all his points in the first three quarters and going scoreless in the fourth.\n\n\"I don't know what has to change, but definitely something needs to change,\" Dončić said surrounding the team. \"We got to figure it out; that's the thing we have [to do]. Everybody got to talk about it. I know JJ said it's going to be uncomfortable. As it should be.\"\n\nTo make matters worse, the Lakers lost Austin Reaves before they could reach halftime. A calf injury, the same one that's been keeping him out of the rotation lately, led to an early exit for Reaves as he finished with 12 points in 14 minutes.\n\nLeBron James finished with 18 points (five rebounds) on seven-of-13 shooting.\n\nBefore their next game, on Sunday at home against the Kings, the Lakers will have a practice on Saturday and Redick confirmed it will be a practice that is not going to be comfortable following their biggest home loss of the season.\n\n\"It's a matter of making the choice and far too often we don't have guys who want to make that choice.\" Redick said, \"It's pretty consistent who those guys are.  Saturday's practice is going to be uncomfortable. I'm not doing another 53 games like this.\"",

    "description": "The Minnesota Vikings are doing Minnesota Vikings things, refusing to let a disappointing season swirl down the toilet in pursuit […]",
    "fullText": "The Minnesota Vikings are doing Minnesota Vikings things, refusing to let a disappointing season swirl down the toilet in pursuit of relevance and respectability. Playing the role of spoiler on Christmas Day — so, yes, The Grinch — Minnesota dropped Detroit 23-10 and effectively ended Dan Campbell’s season. The Lions cannot qualify for the playoffs, despite the all-in stakes professed by the coaching staff and front office at the start of the year.\n\nThe Vikings didn’t just beat Detroit — they dragged the Lions through full desperation mode and made the whole thing look way too easy, especially on defense.\n\nIn a game that featured historically poor quarterback play for the Vikings, Kevin O’Connell and Co. made the Lions look like fools. Utter fools.\n\nThe Lions haven’t looked this buffoonish in a half-decade.\n\n1. Undrafted free-agent quarterback Max Brosmer led the way for Minnesota, filling in for J.J. McCarthy, and as a result, the Vikings finished with 3 passing yards. Yes, a trio of passing yards. Let’s say this loud and clear: Minnesota should have lost and probably handily. But Detroit turned the ball over 6 times. That’s a death sentence for every team in the NFL. Brian Flores outworked the entire Lions coaching staff and made that hodgepodge of NFL brains look silly.\n\n2. Brosmer should compete for the Vikings’ QB3 job next summer — that’s it. He doesn’t have the chops to be a starter in the NFL, and he’s proved this season that he shouldn’t be the QB2 next year. Props to him and the team for beating Detroit, but hopefully somebody within the organization realizes that Brosmer was a liability, not an asset, on Thursday.\n\n3. It’s always better to beat a division rival when that team’s playoff hopes hang in the balance than lose and increase the draft pick or enhance the following year’s schedule. The sooner you discover that players and coaches are not in the “tanking” business, the happier you will be watching sports.\n\n4. Throwing for 3 yards and getting sacked 7 times while still winning a game by 13 points will make a hardcore NFL fan’s brain short-circuit. This stat is a total indictment of the Lions as an organization. Optimistic Detroit fans will maintain that the Lions’ Super Bowl window is wide open, but the evidence suggests it might be a steeper climb up the hill with Jared Goff’s cap hit checking in at $70 million next season — nearly a $40 million increase from 2024 to 2025.\n\n5. Dallas Turner produced another monster game, and it feels like we’ve typed that exact sentence in the postgame reaction article about four times this season. The man has unbelievable speed, and when he starts to round into a finished product, fans will realize that he was worth the meaty investment during the 2024 NFL Draft.\n\n6. Justin Jefferson needs 53 yards to keep his 1,000-yard streak alive, the one only occupied by Randy Moss and Mike Evans through a player’s first six career seasons. Minnesota won’t do this, but if McCarthy cannot play because of the hand injury, O’Connell should almost consider playing veteran John Wolford. He’ll likely complete more passes than Brosmer.\n\n7. Blake Cashman had 17 tackles last week, and he had 17 tackles this week. This time, though, he also added a sack, tackle for loss, and quarterback hit. The Eden Prairie native is a machine, and he should play out the rest of his career with the Vikings. That’s the official position of VikingsTerritory.com.\n\n8. In some games during the middle of the season, Harrison Smith looked like a guy who needed to retire at season’s end. Smith, however, has reversed that inevitability, now playing like a dude who should stick around for one more run in 2026 and play, for example, 20-30 snaps per game. The longtime Viking and Hall of Fame hopeful will probably walk away next month, but he’s playing at a level that suggests staying power for one more year. He looked phenomenal on Christmas.\n\n9. Andrew Van Ginkel also played wonderfully, bringing to life his disruptor role. Like Cashman, the Vikings should let Van Ginkel stick around as long as he wants.\n\n10. Speaking of sticking around as long as someone wants, the will-he-stay-or-will-he-go conversation about Brian Flores will turn white-hot in about 10 days. Flores deserves another head coaching job in the NFL, but owners might be skittish about taking the plunge because his lawsuit against the league is still active. If the NFL keeps him on an island, he, too, should stay with the Vikings forever.\n\n11. O’Connell called a terrific game, considering his quarterback was futile, and his offensive line was ravaged. If you still think O’Connell should “give up playcalling,” you should really study his plays, rather than young and often imbecilic quarterbacks running them. The plays are beautiful. See: the game-sealing touchdown run by Jordan Addison. Eventually, McCarthy will execute the plays properly, or the Vikings will find someone who can.\n\n12. If the Green Bay Packers beat the Baltimore Ravens, and the Chicago Bears lose to the San Francisco 49ers, the Vikings can play the spoiler role again in Week 18 by defeating Green Bay at home, while hoping the Lions beat the Bears. That plan assumes Vikings fans would rather have Green Bay get a Wildcard spot than a division title.",

Who are they, these stars?\n\nA team with no energy, a team with no fight,\n\nA team that once dazzled now fades into the night.\n\nThe desert revealed them, the Rockets exposed,\n\nThe truth is now out there; the door is now closed.\n\nYet doors can reopen, can swing both ways,\n\nCan welcome the morning, can brighten the days.\n\nBut first must come honesty, hard choices made,\n\nChampionship habits cannot be outweighed.\n\nThe Lakers have talent, the Lakers have names,\n\nBut talent alone wins no playoff games.\n\nIt takes five guys moving; it takes trust and belief.\n\nIt takes caring enough to embrace the complicated grief.\n\nSo on this December night, as the chill falls on nowhere,\n\nAs palm trees stand silent beneath the thick air,\n\nThe Lakers face Christmas with coal in their socks,\n\nA team that must look in the mirror and talk.\n\nAbout who they are, about what they will be,\n\nAbout giving effort, about setting free\n\nThe potential they've bottled, the promise they've sold,\n\nBefore this whole season turns purple to mold.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe future status of Golden State Warriors forward Jonathan Kuminga remains one of the most fascinating in the NBA, and trade talks involving him are growing louder.\n\nBleacher Report's Eric Pincus proposed an eight-team deal that would send Kuminga elsewhere and reunite Klay Thompson with the Warriors. The full trade involves the Warriors, Jazz, Mavericks, Magic, Nets, Nuggets, Raptors and Suns.\n\nGolden State would receive Thompson, Jonathan Isaac, Day'Ron Sharpe, Garrett Temple and a Jazz 2027 first-round pick. Kuminga would head to Utah, along with Hunter Tyson (Nuggets) and Nigel Hayes-Davis (Suns). Buddy Hield, Al Horford and Trayce Jackson-Davis would also be moved from the Warriors in the deal.\n\n\"The Warriors satisfy Curry's wishes, getting Thompson to replace Hield, who has struggled to hit shots this season,\" Pincus said. \"The trio (with Draymond Green) would be on the path to close their historic runs together through the 2026-27 season, provided Green opts into the final year of his contract.\"\n\nMORE: Ben Simmons is going pro in a sport you'd never expect\n\nThompson would return to Golden State, where he spent 13 seasons before being traded to Dallas in the 2024 offseason. Kuminga, who's seen a diminished role with the Warriors this season, would get a fresh start.\n\n\"Perhaps more importantly, the team gains necessary closure on the drawn-out Jonathan Kuminga saga, which left him a restricted free agent for most of the summer and currently has the 23-year-old forward out of coach Steve Kerr's rotation.\"\n\nThe eight-team deal would be the largest trade in NBA history, passing the Houston Rockets' trade for Kevin Durant last summer.\n\nSteph's quote about Klay will bring a tear to Warriors fans\n\nJoe Mazzulla wants to get a pet wolf\n\nSteven Adams has the craziest eating habits in the NBA\n\nAnthony Edwards had an \"I'm him\" moment vs. Thunder\n\nWe finally know how Michael Jordan really feels about Scottie Pippen\n\nCooper Flagg's clutch stats are unprecedented",

A free edition is also sent on Mondays – you can \n\nAs Premier League squads begin physically conditioning themselves for the Christmas schedule from mid-December, the former players among the coaching staff often find themselves laughing at how it used to be.\n\nBack in the mid-1990s, it could mean four games in nine – or even eight – days. There were barely any breaks. It already sounds unhealthy for players, but it was also about how it felt. Some from the mid-2000s now shake their heads at how their main memory of the period wasn’t jaded legs or turkey at the training ground, but an upset stomach. That was because many players effectively had “caffeine routines” on matchdays, which they then had to repeat again and again in quick succession.\n\nI used to ghostwrite a column for Stephen Hunt, and he told me that for a 3pm kick-off it would be two coffees in the morning, followed by a Red Bull – or an energy drink called Phase 1, the equivalent of around six coffees – and usually some caffeine tablets on top. Their heart rate would already be elevated before they played, and they could barely eat afterwards because their stomach was so raw.\n\nOn the sound of that, it probably ought to form part of the argument over whether caffeine should be banned from football.\n\nPreparation is obviously far more scientific now, even if those discarded snus pouches have become a familiar sight around some training grounds.\n\nAt the very least, we are long past the point where the congested Christmas schedule functioned as a mini stress test for a team’s endurance over the season. There even used to be some correlation between who collected the most points at Christmas and who eventually won the league.\n\nThis season, the schedule more closely resembles a standard European rhythm. All teams are playing four games across 11 to 13 days – weekend, midweek, weekend, midweek. Many are well used to that cadence, even if the fact that every one of these matches is a Premier League game brings a different level of intensity.\n\nWhat this spell now offers is a test of a different kind – and one that hints at a broader evolution in football. It is the shift from manager-led clubs to what might be called “performance-led” clubs: organisations where science dictates decision-making at every level.\n\nThat may sound surprising given that every coaching staff is now surrounded by reams of data. The difference, however, lies in how much those decisions are actually shaped by it.\n\nIt has become the bane of some sporting directors’ careers.\n\nTo keep reading and unlock the full Friday edition of Miguel Delaney: Inside Football, \n\nTo receive the free, Monday newsletter simply enter your email address in the box at the top of this page.\n\nYou can also head to our newsletter preference centre to \n\nOnce there, all you need to do is press the ‘+’ button and enter your email address.\n\nMiguel Delaney's Inside Football newsletter lands in your inbox every Monday and Friday (The Independent)",

    "title": "Atkinson And Blades: Sunderland’s New Dynamic Duo?",
    "description": "The Lasses have two extremely talented players waiting in the wings. Could their chance be about to arrive?",
    "fullText": "Given the Lasses’ limited attacking output, there’s a sense that Sunderland haven’t quite reached their full creative potential.\n\nInjuries have disrupted their rhythm, limited options, and forced tactical reshuffles, and among the players whose absences have been felt most keenly are Izzy Atkinson and Reanna Blades — two wide players who offer something different.\n\nAlthough supporters have only seen glimpses of their quality due to injury setbacks, those brief appearances have been enough to spark excitement. Both players bring pace, directness and a willingness to take risks in the final third — qualities that can elevate a good attacking unit into a great one.\n\nAs Sunderland look ahead to the second half of the season — and particularly as we prepare for the potential departure of Keira Barry when her loan from Manchester United ends in January — the returns of Atkinson and Blades could prove decisive.\n\nTheir availability would not only restore depth but also unlock new tactical possibilities, giving the team fresh ways to break down stubborn defences.\n\nHere, we’ll explores their journeys, their styles of play, and how they fit into Sunderland’s evolving identity, as well as considering why their returns from injury could be perfectly timed and offer them a chance to rise to the occasion at a pivotal moment in the campaign.\n\nAtkinson’s footballing journey has already taken her across leagues, countries, and positions, yet she’s still only in her early twenties.\n\nHer career began in Ireland, where she emerged as one of the brightest young talents in the Women’s National League. Her performances for Shelbourne quickly led to international recognition and she became one of the youngest players to represent the Republic of Ireland at senior level. That early exposure to high‑pressure football shaped her into a player with confidence on the ball and a maturity beyond her years.\n\nA move to Celtic followed, where she continued to develop her attacking instincts. Although often deployed as a full back or wing back, Atkinson’s natural inclination was always to drive forward, take players on, and create overloads in wide areas.\n\nHer time in Scotland showcased her versatility but also highlighted her potential as an out‑and‑out winger.\n\nWest Ham recognised that and brought her into the WSL, where she gained valuable experience against some of the strongest defenders in the country. Even during limited minutes, she demonstrated flashes of the dynamism that had defined her earlier career — and the same could be said about her time with Crystal Palace.\n\nHer arrival at Sunderland felt like the perfect match: a club committed to developing young talent and a player eager for consistent minutes in her preferred attacking role.\n\nUnfortunately, injuries have restricted her involvement this season, preventing her from building rhythm or fully integrating into the team’s patterns of play. Yet during the short spells she’s featured in, Atkinson has shown exactly why the coaching staff were so keen to bring her in.\n\nHer style of play is built around direct running and intelligent movement.\n\nShe wants to commit defenders, force mistakes, and open up space for teammates. Her left foot is a real asset, allowing her to deliver dangerous crosses or cut inside to shoot. She also has a strong work ethic off the ball, pressing aggressively and tracking back when needed. This blend of creativity and industry makes her a natural fit for Sunderland’s high‑energy approach.\n\nWhere she fits into the team is an intriguing question, because her versatility gives the manager multiple options. She can play on either wing, though she’s arguably most effective on the left, where she can stretch the pitch and isolate full backs.\n\nHer ability to beat players one‑on‑one adds a dimension Sunderland have occasionally lacked when facing deep defensive blocks. With Barry’s potential departure looming, Atkinson could become a key figure in maintaining the team’s attacking threat from wide areas.\n\nBarry’s pace and directness have been crucial this season and while no two players are identical, Atkinson offers many of the same qualities with the added benefit of experience at higher levels.\n\nIf she can stay fit, Atkinson has the potential to become one of Sunderland’s most influential players in the second half of the campaign. Her return would not only strengthen the starting eleven but also provide the squad with greater tactical flexibility, allowing the manager to rotate, adapt, and respond to different challenges.\n\nBlades represents a different type of story; that of a young player on the cusp of a breakthrough whose progress has been interrupted by injury but whose ceiling remains incredibly high.\n\nA product of Chelsea’s academy, Blades grew up in one of the most competitive youth environments in the country. Her development there shaped her into a modern winger: fast, technically sharp, and unafraid to take risks in possession.\n\nShe’s long been regarded as one of the most exciting prospects within her age group, and her move to Sunderland was seen as a chance for her to gain senior experience in a team that values youth and ambition.\n\nLike Atkinson, Blades’ season has been disrupted by injury, limiting her opportunities to build momentum, yet during in the minutes she has played, she made an immediate impression.\n\nHer acceleration over short distances is exceptional, allowing her to burst past defenders and create separation in tight spaces. She plays with a confidence that belies her age, always looking to drive forward, combine with teammates, or cut inside to shoot.\n\nBlades’ style of play is defined by explosive pace and sharp decision‑making. She thrives in transitional moments, where her ability to carry the ball at speed can turn defence into attack in seconds. Her dribbling is direct and purposeful, and she has a knack for finding pockets of space between the lines.\n\nWhat makes her particularly valuable is her unpredictability. Defenders can’t easily anticipate whether she’ll go wide, cut inside, or slip a pass through. This unpredictability is something Sunderland have occasionally lacked when forced to break down organised defences.\n\nHer role within the team is clear.\n\nSunderland’s attacking structure relies heavily on wide players who can stretch the pitch, create overloads, and provide service to the forwards. Blades offers all of that but she also brings a level of individual creativity that allows her to unlock games on her own.\n\nWith the team’s current reliance on Barry for pace and penetration, Blades’ return would ease the burden and give Sunderland multiple outlets in wide areas.\n\nIf Barry does return to Manchester United in January, Blades will become even more important. Her profile is one of the closest matches to Barry’s within the squad, and her ability to replicate that direct threat could be crucial in maintaining Sunderland’s attacking balance.\n\nThere’s also a psychological element to her return.\n\nYoung players often grow rapidly after recovering from injury, using the setback as motivation to push themselves further. Blades has the talent and the mentality to seize this moment — and Sunderland could be the perfect environment for her to flourish.\n\nWhilst accolades and metrics have been impressive for Sunderland’s attackers on an individual scale, the attacking output hasn’t consistently resulted in goals. The Lasses find themselves with -4 GD — more for the amount of goals they concede rather the goals they score — yet both areas are in need of improvement.\n\nWe’re currently averaging 0.9 points per game, 1.5 goals per game and 1.9 goals conceded per game.\n\nInjuries, rotation, and the demands of the WSL2 have tested the squad’s depth and the potential loss of Barry in January adds another layer of uncertainty. Barry has been one of the team’s most influential players, offering pace, creativity, and a constant threat in behind. Replacing that output won’t be straightforward, but the returns of Atkinson and Blades will provide a realistic pathway towards maintaining and potentially enhancing the team’s attacking potency.\n\nBoth players bring qualities that Sunderland have missed during their absences. Atkinson offers composure, experience, and a cultured left foot, while Blades brings raw pace, unpredictability, and youthful energy.\n\nTogether, they give the team more variety in wide areas, allowing the manager to tailor the attack to suit different opponents. Their presence also reduces the physical and tactical load on other attackers, enabling more rotation and the introduction of fresher legs late in games.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, their returns will inject a sense of renewed competition and opportunity.\n\nWhen talented players come back from injury, it lifts the entire squad. Training becomes sharper, tactical options expand, and the team gains a psychological boost.\n\nFor the players themselves, this is a chance to make a statement and with Barry potentially leaving, the door is open for one or both to step into a more prominent role.\n\nSunderland have built a reputation for developing young talent and giving players the platform to grow — and Atkinson and Blades fit that mould perfectly.\n\nTheir returns could mark the beginning of a new phase in the team’s attacking evolution, one defined by pace, creativity, and a willingness to take risks. If they can stay fit and find rhythm, they have the potential to transform Sunderland’s attack from “dangerous” to “devastating”.\n\nFootball seasons often hinge on moments of opportunity. Departures and tactical shifts can lead to unexpected chances for players to step forward, and for Atkinson and Blades, the coming months represent such an opening.\n\nTheir talent is undeniable; their potential is significant, and their impact when fit is already visible.\n\nWhether they become key to unlocking Sunderland’s attack remains to be seen, but the ingredients are certainly there. What’s clear is that their presence gives the team more depth, more creativity and more unpredictability. In a league as competitive as the WSL2, those qualities can make all the difference.\n\nIf Sunderland are to find themselves on an upward trajectory, they’ll need players who can change games, stretch defences, and provide moments of inspiration — and Atkinson and Blades have shown they can do exactly that.\n\nWith the second half of the season approaching and the possibility of Barry’s departure on the horizon, the stage is set for them to rise to the occasion.",

    "description": "At Cincinnati College Prep, Jeff Cargile wants his students to succeed as much in the classroom as on the field. Get to know this football coach.",
    "fullText": "Jeff Cargile has been a beacon of hope for the Cincinnati College Prep Academy football team.\n\nIn four seasons, he's led the Lions to a 29-14 overall record, a three-peat of league titles and the school's first-ever regional semifinal appearance.\n\nBut the thing he's most proud of is that the team had a 3.1 grade-point average in the first quarter of this school year.\n\n\"Coaching football for me is more than just X's and O's. It's the life lessons that are taught along the way,\" Cargile wrote in an Oct. 19 Facebook post.\n\nHis coaching acumen and desire to see his students achieve bigger and better things helped turn CCPA into a consistent winner on and off the field.\n\n\"He's always been a guy with a lot of love. He doesn't know a stranger and he doesn't know an enemy,\" said St. Henry (Kentucky) head coach Tim Odom, who played against Cargile in high school and alongside him at Ohio State.\n\nIn 2019, Cargile's Taft Senators played in the Division V, Region 20 semifinals and had high hopes for the 2020 season.\n\nBut during that COVID-shortened season, Cincinnati Public Schools did not kick off until mid-September. It was the only school district in Southwest Ohio not to begin playing in late August. Cargile was among those who spoke publicly, saying they thought the decision hurt the students; he saw multiple players get into trouble with the law while they were unable to play football.\n\n\"Looking back on it now, I would have probably done it differently,\" Cargile said of the situation that may have led to him and Taft parting ways. \"But a lot of these kids, you have to merge (academics and athletics) together, because for a lot of them, that's what motivates them to be at school every day.\"\n\nHis main concern was that he didn't want to see his kids go down the same road he had in the 1990s and 2000s. Cargile is approaching 20 years free of drug and alcohol abuse and has spent time in jail for multiple offenses.\n\nIn 2015, the Ohio State Board of Education granted Cargile a certificate of qualification for employment (CQE) with the stipulation that he undergo a criminal background check one year later. He has had a spotless record since leaving prison in 2005.\n\n\"I've been to the penitentiary, I've been in and out of jail and treatment facilities. I've lost relationships with family members that I've had to regain. They don't have to do that because I already did. I've borne all that pain,\" Cargile said.\n\nAfter parting ways with Taft, a school he said he has no ill will toward, he was instantly given another opportunity by then-CCPA head coach Jeremy Pflug. Cargile was the defensive coordinator for one year before taking over as the head coach when Pflug left to coach at Woodward.\n\nMore: After losing parents, surviving fire, CCPA's Petey Jones finds crowning moment on football field\n\nWhile the Lions struggled in his first year and ended with a 5-6 record, they have won at least seven games in each of the last three years, including a trip to the regional semifinals in 2024.\n\nSuccess has followed Cargile everywhere he's gone. He had a 38-12 record in five years at Taft. After a college career where he was a three-year letter winner at Ohio State, he spent stints at Withrow, Madeira and his alma mater, Roger Bacon.\n\n\"He was the most talented competitor we played against in the GCL those years. He was an unbelievable running back and a tremendous human being,\" Odom said.\n\nCargile has a soft spot for small, urban schools because of his upbringing through Roger Bacon. He is most comfortable in those environments, and he said he believes that life has led him to those places because that's where he can have the greatest impact on his students.\n\n\"I try to run my program like a Power Five college program. I know I don't have all the resources a lot of these bigger schools have, but one of the things I used to hate hearing coaches and administrators say was, 'You can't do that stuff at Taft or at Withrow.' I've always come from the school of 'you can.'\" Cargile said. \"I'm very firm and very stern in my message to them, but I love my kids at the same time. I try to give them the best opportunities that I can.\"\n\nThe CMAC website listed 40 players on CCPA's 2025 roster. Only five were seniors.\n\nThe Lions, who went 8-3 this season and won a third straight CMAC-Blue title, return quarterback Kemmarion McCray, leading rusher Marlan Robertson, top receivers Kendrick Napier and Mario Meatchem, and defensive stars Sir Michael Miller, Charles Howard, Kenny Powe, Ryan Drew and Ramik Bell.\n\n\"I am so excited and I'm so anxious to get this offseason started. This team that I have coming back, there's no way that we should not be playing in the regional semi or the regional championship next year. I'm anxious for my kids to get to compete with the St. Henrys and the Marion Locals,\" Cargile said.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cincinnati Enquirer: Jeff Cargile brings compassion, winning attitude to CCPA football",

    "description": "After his dad began recovering from a stroke, Rick Fayter pulled a rare Shohei Ohtani baseball card from a pack he bought at a Greater Cincinnati shop.",
    "fullText": "Rick Fayter was just looking for a way to decompress when he walked into a common card shop just outside Cincinnati.\n\nThe 47-year-old, who currently lives in Texas but grew up in Fairfield, Ohio, flew into town with his son after his father suffered a stroke in June. After spending days in the ICU, Fayter's father began responding to treatment that helped thin out a blood clot in his brain, putting him on the road to recovery.\n\nIn light of the good news, Fayter, who loves baseball and refers to himself as an avid baseball card \"collector,\" visited Card Stocks in Liberty Township simply to just clear his mind.\n\nCatching Fayter's eye in the shop were a few Topps Tier One Baseball card boxes, which contain premium autographed, relic and parallel cards.\n\nAfter a brief consultation with an employee, Fayter said he opted to purchase a 2022 edition of the Tier One box for about $350.\n\nFayter opened the box right then and there and what he pulled was beyond his wildest dreams, something that netted him a significant return on investment.\n\nEmerging from the silver-colored packaging was a 1-of-1 Topps 2022 Shohei Ohtani game-used bat knob signed relic card, graded near mint-mint+8.5 by Beckett Grading Services.\n\n\"When I ripped it open, it kind of ripped down the middle, and I could see is the name, and it said, 'Shohei Ohtani.' And I was like, 'Oh my gosh, man ... Is this happening right now?'\"\n\nThe manufacture date written on the bat knob is 2018, which corresponds to Ohtani's rookie year when he played for the Los Angeles Angels. Since then, the Japanese-born superstar has gone on to become a five-time All-Star, a four-time MVP and a two-time World Series champion with the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\n\"Shohei Ohtani has completely transcended the game of baseball,\" said Fayter, who grew up a Cincinnati Reds fan. \"He's bringing back the heartbeat of the game that the game needed ... He's somebody on the field that show enormous character and really appear to play the game because he truly loves it.\"\n\nAfter citing that a comparative Ohtani card sold recently this year for $132,000, Fayter put his card up for auction with Goldin, a New Jersey-based auction house. Fayter's card ended up auctioning for just over $86,000 on Nov. 29.\n\nFayter added that his card's action landed in the top 15 on the Goldin Elite Auction list and was second priciest bat knob card ever sold.\n\nWhile Fayter is looking forward to what the card auctions for, he said the proceeds will mostly go toward helping secure a good future for his 12-year-old son, who also plays baseball.\n\n\"Everything that I do is for my son, and that money could really benefit a lot of good prosperous things for his future,\" Fayter said.\n\nThe Enquirer reached out to Card Stocks for further comment but did not immediately receive response.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cincinnati Enquirer: Rare Shohei Ohtani baseball card purchased at Greater Cincinnati shop",

    "fullText": "A baseball field under construction in Ontario will soon welcome the newly-designated Single-A minor league affiliate for the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nThe general manager for the Ontario Tower Buzzers says ONT Field is nearly complete and will be ready come opening day on April 2, 2026.\n\n\"The city of Ontario wanted to do some bold moves,\" said general manager Allan Benavides. \"They built arguably the best minor league stadium in the whole nation, regardless of classification.\"\n\nBenavides recently gave Eyewitness News an exclusive look at the stadium's progress, including the high-tech locker room for the home team as well as the field suite located right next to the home team's dugout.\n\n\"These dugout suites are extremely unique. I have not seen them anywhere in minor league baseball,\" he said.\n\nThe stadium will offer approximately 6,000 seats and offer patrons entrance to games as low as $5 per ticket.\n\nOfficials with the city of Ontario said the facility will not only be an attraction for tourists, but it will also provide an entertaining venue for local residents.\n\n\"We already have so many amenities in Ontario,\" said Jennifer Hiramoto, the executive director of economic development for the city of Ontario. \"We have the international airport, we have the Ontario Mills, and we have the Toyota Arena.\"\n\n\"This is just another feather in our cap,\" she added.\n\nNot only will ONT Field pay homage to the nearby international airport, with gates named with words such as \"Arrival\" and \"Boarding.\"\n\nBut the video board and outfield walls are also designed to mirror what baseball fans see at Dodger Stadium in Elysian Park.\n\n\"Ontario Airport sits two miles behind the video board,\" said Benavides. \"We have an incredible view of the San Gabriel Mountains. It's just unbelievable.\"\n\nHiramoto said it's taken years for the city of Ontario to secure the partnership with the Dodgers and build the stadium, but she said the end is in sight.\n\n\"Ontario positioned itself to be the home to the Dodger affiliate,\" said Hiramoto. \"All we needed to do was buy 200 acres, sign a contract with the team, build a stadium and all the supporting infrastructure, and do it by April 2026... and here we are.

    "description": "Apple, Michigan taxpayers, and one of Detroit’s wealthiest families spent roughly $30 million training hundreds of people to build iPhone apps. Not everyone lands coding jobs right away.",
    "fullText": "Lizmary Fernandez took a detour from studying to be an immigration attorney to join a free Apple course for making iPhone apps. The Apple Developer Academy in Detroit launched as part of the company’s $200 million response to the Black Lives Matter protests and aims to expand opportunities for people of color in the country’s poorest big city.\n\nBut Fernandez found the program’s cost-of-living stipend lacking—“A lot of us got on food stamps,” she says—and the coursework insufficient for landing a coding job. “I didn’t have the experience or portfolio,” says the 25-year-old, who is now a flight attendant and preparing to apply to law school. “Coding is not something I got back to.”\n\nSince 2021, the academy has welcomed over 1,700 students, a racially diverse mix with varying levels of tech literacy and financial flexibility. About 600 students, including Fernandez, have completed its 10-month course of half-days at Michigan State University, which cosponsors the Apple-branded and Apple-focused program.\n\nWIRED reviewed contracts and budgets and spoke with officials and graduates for the first in-depth examination of the nearly $30 million invested in the academy over the past four years—almost 30 percent of which came from Michigan taxpayers and the university’s regular students. As tech giants begin pouring billions of dollars into AI-related job training courses across the country, the Apple academy offers lessons on the challenges of uplifting diverse communities.\n\nSeven graduates who spoke with WIRED said they had good experiences at the academy, citing benefits such as receiving mentorship from past students. Fernandez says she was impressed by a focus on developing inclusive apps and a series of speakers from Apple who were genuinely willing to help and share frank lessons. “Their heart was in the right place,” she says.\n\nThe program does expose people of color to new possibilities. “It changed my life,” says Min Thu Khine, who’s now mentoring coding students and working at an Apple Store Genius Bar. “My dream is to be a software engineer at Apple.”\n\nThe academy also draws positive grades from some researchers who study tech education, such as Quinn Burke. He says its fully subsidized in-person instruction surpasses the quality of many coding boot camps, which proliferated over the past decade and sometimes left students in debt and with narrow skills.\n\nBut the academy being open to all can complicate instruction and how to measure success. One entire family attended together, and at least two mothers have come with their daughters. Students on average are in their thirties, ranging from 18-year-olds to, for example, a grandfather in his seventies who wanted to develop a photo app for his grandchild, according to Sarah Gretter, the academy leader for Michigan State.",

Americans pay into the program during their working careers, which is also supplemented by the federal government.\n\nBeneficiaries' final tax bill depends on their state, annual income, and eligibility for deductions.\n\nSocial Security income is typically taxed at the national level. Americans may pay taxes on up to 85% of their Social Security payments, depending on household income.\n\nBut those who take home less than $25,000 as an individual and $32,000 as a couple do not have their benefits taxed. Need-based Supplemental Social Security also isn't subject to tax.\n\nAnd President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act will bring more tax relief to seniors. In the new year, taxpayers 65 and older can claim up to $6,000 in addition to their normal standard deduction. This builds on an existing tax deduction for older adults. The expanded breaks under Trump are set to last through 2028.\n\nThis means that older Americans filing their 2025 tax returns can write off as much as $23,750, and joint filers over 65 could claim as much as $46,700.\n\nStates are able to set their own Social Security tax rules alongside national requirements. Eight states taxed Social Security income this year, while 41 didn't. And, in 2026, West Virginia will stop taxing benefits.\n\nThe amount beneficiaries will pay in state-level taxes varies widely depending on a local laws and household earnings. Connecticut, Minnesota, Montana, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Utah, and Vermont tax Social Security — though lower-income retirees are often exempt.\n\nColorado also allows some seniors to deduct their federal Social Security taxes from their expected state contribution.\n\nSee below if your state taxes benefit income.",

    "description": "The conversation about AI and the future of software engineering is often framed incorrectly. It usually oscillates between two extremes (total replacement or total irrelevance). Both are intellectually lazy. A better framing is simpler (and more uncomfortable): >AI will not replace software engineers. >It will replace inefficiency.",
    "fullText": "The conversation about AI and the future of software engineering is often framed incorrectly. It usually oscillates between two extremes (total replacement or total irrelevance). Both are intellectually lazy.\n\nA better framing is simpler (and more uncomfortable):\n\nAI will not replace software engineers.\n\nIt will replace inefficiency.\n\nAnd paradoxically, when inefficiency is removed from a profession, the profession often expands. Work does not disappear. It migrates upward (toward harder problems, sharper constraints, and higher expectations). That is the shape of this shift.\n\nThere is a popular fear that AI reduces headcount. In practice, most technological revolutions do something subtler: they reduce the cost of production, then increase the scope of what becomes worth producing.\n\nSoftware engineering has always had a hidden subsidy (high cost of experimentation and slow iteration). When it was expensive to try ideas, teams needed fewer attempts and tolerated slower loops. AI changes the economics. It makes iteration cheap, exploration cheap, and “first draft implementation” almost free. That does not eliminate the need for engineers. It changes what engineers are being paid for.\n\nThe engineer who cannot compound with automation becomes expensive. The engineer who can becomes a force multiplier.\n\nThis is not about juniors versus seniors. It is about efficiency per unit of cognitive effort. If someone needs a week to do what a peer does in a day with AI assistance, the market will treat that gap the same way it treats any other inefficiency (it will price it out). The future does not punish competence. It punishes non-compounding workflows.\n\nHere is the paradox: AI increases the value of great engineers while decreasing the value of many tasks great engineers used to do. That is why people get confused. They look at tasks disappearing and assume roles disappear too. But roles are aggregates of problems, and problems expand when costs drop.\n\n“There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all.” (Peter Drucker)\n\nA common mistake is to imagine a fixed amount of software demand, then assume that higher productivity implies fewer engineers. In reality, demand is elastic.\n\nWhen the cost of building drops:\n\nThis is why automation often expands the total surface area of work. AI does not just make current teams faster. It makes entirely new categories of work economically defensible (and it lowers the barrier for smaller teams to compete).\n\nThe shift is not “fewer engineers.”\n\nIt is “more engineers working differently.”\n\nAnd there is another paradox here: the easier it becomes to write software, the more software we will have, and the more we will depend on it. Dependence increases the value of reliability, clarity, and governance. So the profession grows (but expectations rise).\n\nThis is the part many people sense but do not articulate cleanly.\n\nBig companies will still be big. Their products will still be huge. Their compliance surface will still be real. Their customer support load will still exist. Their infrastructure will still need boring reliability.\n\nBut the center of gravity of actual product execution will keep drifting toward smaller teams.\n\nBecause AI changes the shape of the bottleneck. When implementation becomes cheaper, coordination becomes the dominant cost. And coordination cost grows non-linearly with team size.\n\nThere is a basic truth that becomes obvious once you feel it in your bones:\n\nA team can be large and fast (but then it bleeds alignment time).\n\nA team can be large and aligned (but then it bleeds velocity).\n\nA team can be small and aligned (and that is where speed becomes sustainable).\n\nAI magnifies this effect by compressing the “output per engineer” curve. A small team with strong context can now produce what previously required a much larger group. That does not mean every team becomes tiny. It means the efficient frontier shifts.\n\nSo you get a new equilibrium in companies:\n\nThis matters for careers, because “small team leverage” becomes one of the most obvious paths to long-run upside.\n\nA small team is not a smaller job. It is often a larger job distributed across fewer people. That is why the upside concentrates there (and why the bar rises there).\n\n“Fools ignore complexity. Pragmatists suffer it. Some can avoid it. Geniuses remove it.” (Alan Perlis)\n\nThis is not an argument against traditional learning, depth, or rigor. Those still matter. The difference is tempo, aka, time.\n\nAI compresses the learning curve. It makes it possible to:\n\nAs a result, the market increasingly rewards engineers for:\n\nThe future belongs to people who can learn, unlearn, and relearn without ego.\n\nA subtle point: “fast learning” is not the same as “shallow learning.” Fast learning is the ability to form a usable model quickly, then deepen it selectively. It is learning with intent (and with feedback loops), not just accumulation.\n\nThis is why “learning how to learn” becomes a first-class skill for survival.\n\nAI makes many hard skills cheaper to acquire:\n\nThis does not mean hard skills stop mattering. It means they become less defensible as a standalone advantage.\n\nWhat does not scale at the same rate:\n\nIn other words, the more the implementation layer is commoditized, the more value shifts to the coordination layer.\n\nThere is a paradox here that stings: many people enter engineering to escape social complexity, and the high-leverage version of engineering becomes increasingly social (because the hard part is aligning humans around correct decisions, not typing code).\n\nThis is also why small teams matter. Soft skills compound harder in small teams (because communication overhead becomes visible, and clarity becomes a survival trait).\n\nDepth is not the problem. Rigidity is.\n\nSpecialists remain valuable when their expertise is transferable (rooted in fundamentals, not just in tools). They understand the underlying invariants, not only the surface-level rituals.\n\nNarrow specialization becomes fragile when it depends on:\n\nAI can imitate tool fluency. It cannot replace foundational reasoning as easily. That is why deep specialists who can generalize will still thrive (and narrow specialists who cannot will feel the floor moving).\n\nWhen code is cheap, complexity becomes the dominant expense.\n\nOver the last decade, we normalized complex defaults:\n\nThese choices have real benefits (availability, scalability, fault isolation). But they also introduce real costs:\n\nAI accelerates shipping. But faster shipping into a complex system does not create velocity. It creates churn (more moving parts, more hidden coupling, more failure modes). AI does not remove the tax of complexity. It may even amplify it by making it easy to add components that feel “reasonable” but were never necessary.\n\n“Simplicity is a prerequisite for reliability.” (Edsger W. Dijkstra)\n\nIn brownfield, complexity is often inherited. The work is about containment, migration, and risk reduction.\n\nIn greenfield, complexity is a choice.\n\nIn the AI era, greenfield success increasingly comes from:\n\nThis is a shift in emphasis (less obsession with implementation detail, more investment in modeling and specification). If implementation is cheap, the competitive advantage becomes “building the right thing with the right constraints,” not “handcrafting every line.”\n\nThis is also where small teams shine. Greenfield work punishes bureaucracy. A small, high-context team can move from idea to validated system before a large org finishes aligning on terminology.\n\n“A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked.” (John Gall)\n\nOne of the most underestimated issues in AI-assisted development is reviewing.\n\nBut plausibility is not correctness.\n\nTraditional code review works best with incremental changes and familiar intent. AI often produces larger chunks of code at once. The diff may be readable, but the mental model behind it is not always obvious.\n\nThis creates a paradox: as code becomes easier to produce, it can become harder to trust.\n\nThe bottleneck shifts from writing to verification.\n\nThis is where formal methods return as practical leverage, not as bureaucracy.\n\nWhen you specify invariants formally, you reduce the review problem. You are no longer asking reviewers to rely on intuition (“does this look right?”). You are asking the system to enforce properties (“does this satisfy the specification?”).\n\nFormal methods (proofs, contracts, invariants, strong type systems) do two things extremely well:\n\nIn a world with cheap code, verification becomes the scarce resource. Formal methods are a way to spend scarce attention efficiently.\n\nAnd yes, this is also persuasive for the AI-agnostic crowd: you do not need to worship AI to benefit from it. You can treat it as a stochastic generator and still build a deterministic correctness pipeline around it. The point is not faith. The point is engineering.\n\nTypes and proofs are often treated as complexity. In practice, they are a language for clarity.\n\nWhen intent is formalized, AI becomes more reliable because the output space is constrained. And when systems are constrained, complexity is reduced because fewer invalid states exist.\n\nThis is why I recommend learning Coq and Lean.\n\nNot because every engineer should become a formal methods researcher, but because proof assistants train the exact skill set that becomes scarce:\n\nThey teach you to build software with fewer hidden assumptions (and fewer invisible traps). In the long run, the engineers who can formally reason about systems will have disproportionate leverage (because they can verify what others can only hope is correct).\n\nAI will evolve. Tooling will change. Some approaches will fail. Some hype will collapse. Some paradigms will persist.\n\nThat uncertainty is precisely why the moat is not a tool.\n\nThe moat is the ability to reason under change:\n\nThe paradox is that the future looks automated at the surface (faster code, faster shipping), but becomes more human at the core (judgment, clarity, coordination, and correctness).\n\nAI will not end software engineering.\n\nIt will raise the baseline and punish non-compounding workflows.\n\nIt will expand the surface area of what engineers can build.\n\nAnd it will reward the engineers who can make small teams feel disproportionately powerful (because they can think clearly, specify precisely, and ship without drowning in their own complexity).\n\nThe AI era will not be defined by who can “write code faster” (code is becoming abundant). It will be defined by who can think clearly under change, convert ambiguous intent into explicit constraints, and ship systems that remain correct when the environment shifts.\n\nBig companies will still be big, but the winners inside them will increasingly be small, high-context teams (teams that can move without drowning in coordination). That is also where individual careers concentrate upside (more ownership per person, more exposure to outcomes, higher leverage, and fewer seats for people who cannot compound with automation).\n\nIf you want long-run security, your moat is not a framework. It is a portfolio of meta-skills (learning velocity, judgment, communication, and formal reasoning) that makes you useful even when the tooling landscape changes (or even if some AI approaches plateau). Learn to learn fast. Keep your architecture simple until complexity is forced. Use AI aggressively, but verify rigorously. And when correctness matters, lean on proofs and strong types, not intuition.\n\nIn 2026, I'm gonna be using this blog more recurrently, will talk less on X and other social medias, so, if you care,",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Gemma Bonham-Carter, 40, a working mother in Ottawa, Canada. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAfter having our first baby, my husband and I started dreaming about living in France. Before kids, we'd lived abroad in England and New Zealand, and we wanted our children to grow up with that same sense of adventure.\n\nAfter the pandemic, I realized life was too short to keep saying \"one day.\" Sitting on the dock at my parents' cottage in Ontario, the sun melting into the lake, it hit us: \"If not now, when?\"\n\nAlmost a year later, in September 2023, we packed up our two kids and moved to the South of France for a year.\n\nI run an online business teaching entrepreneurs how to grow and scale using marketing and AI tools. Before the trip, our days were fast-paced: getting the kids out the door, diving into calls, squeezing in gym time, juggling school pickups and family commitments.\n\nUprooting our lives wasn't shocking — we had traveled widely — but doing it with an 8- and 10-year-old added a layer of anxiety.\n\nTo prepare, my husband took a sabbatical from his government consulting job. I cut back my hours. We rented out our home to a single dad who was renovating his house.\n\nWe wanted our kids to learn French, and the slower, community-focused rhythm of southern France felt like the right choice. My husband and I both spoke the language.\n\nAix-en-Provence — sunny, walkable, and bursting with culture and food — seemed perfect. When we found an apartment on SabbaticalHomes.com, it felt like fate.\n\nOf course, fears loomed. Securing visas, enrolling the kids in school, and budgeting our savings — around $75,000 — made my head spin. Could the kids adjust? Could we? With frugal creativity — walking everywhere, cooking at home, renting a car only on weekends — the answer was yes.\n\nOur three-bedroom apartment in an old building had slanted ceilings, stone details, and a stunning view over rooftops. The cathedral bells became our morning soundtrack. A few touches from the local markets and the kids' artwork made it feel like home.\n\nOur landlord and her husband were warm and welcoming, helping us navigate school enrolment, paperwork, and French life. They felt like surrogate grandparents for the year.\n\nOur shy son, just beginning French, struggled at first. I nervously sent a message through the local parents' WhatsApp group to introduce our family. That same day, he returned home with seven new friends.\n\nDaily life in Aix was blissfully different. Weekdays meant walking the kids to school, grabbing fresh bread, and working from a café. Afternoons were for exploring; evenings for cooking, strolling, or simply watching the world go by.\n\nWednesdays — when many French schools, including ours, close — became our favorite: lingering over coffee while the kids swam and soaking in the slow, communal rhythm.\n\nWeekends brought adventures: wandering Luberon villages, the Calanques in Cassis, and the Provençal countryside. During school holidays, we ventured further — Italy, Malta, Belgium, Greece. Watching our children absorb culture and history with such openness was unforgettable.\n\nI thrive when life is slower, more intentional, and less cluttered by consumerism and overscheduling. Walking everywhere and embracing minimalism brought a presence and joy I didn't realize I was missing.\n\nWe returned to Ottawa in August 2024. Coming home was bittersweet. I missed the \"third spaces\" — the lively squares, cafés, and patios where community forms naturally.\n\nCanada felt quieter, more car-dependent, more indoors. But I also became fiercely protective of our time and energy. I now design my work around the life I want, not the other way around. Parenting shifted too: I give my kids more independence, knowing they can thrive outside their comfort zones.\n\nOn paper, our days look the same — school drop-offs, work blocks, family time — but they feel entirely different. I've made a conscious effort to slow down, reduce calls, and create breathing room in my schedule. My husband made a big shift too: he left government consulting and now works with me full-time, which has been incredible for our family.\n\nOttawa will always be home. From the beginning, we knew our year in France was an adventure, not a permanent move.\n\nSomeday, once the kids are older, we dream of owning a charming fixer-upper in southern France.\n\nOur year abroad transformed us — and we're already planning our next escape.\n\nDo you have a story about taking a gap year that you want to share?

    "description": "Ed Lopez and Ben Van Der Fluit were early executives on the Critical Role team. They helped the eight cofounders build a nerdworld empire in 10 years.",
    "fullText": "When the cameras start rolling at the Critical Role studio in Los Angeles, Ed Lopez and Ben Van Der Fluit are never in front of them.\n\nThere are eight far more famous faces that front the operation. Critical Role's cofounders, a team of self-professed nerdy voice actors, have been streaming their show, going on tour, and starting their book business and game publishing arm.\n\nLopez, the team's chief operating officer, and Van Der Fluit, senior vice president of business and content development, have kept things humming on the business front. The duo sat down for a call with Business Insider, during which they talked about their plans to grow Critical Role into a legacy media brand.\n\nBoth Lopez and Van Der Fluit were based in Los Angeles when they met the cast members of Critical Role. It wasn't even a company at the time.\n\n\"Ed and I really had the chance to dig in with the founders in those early days, to start to imagine it beyond just that show,\" Van Der Fluit said.\n\nThe multimedia company that became the Critical Role brand was incorporated in 2015. Lopez, Van Der Fluit, and one other staffer were the company's original executives.\n\n\"The second they have to start worrying about how many units of a book we have or don't have, we're doing it wrong,\" Van Der Fluit said. \"So we were saying that, early on, 'Let us worry about that stuff.'\"\n\nOver the years, Critical Role has evolved into much more than just a Twitch stream, and its co-founders each have specializations. Cofounder Sam Riegel and CEO Travis Willingham helm the development of the team's Amazon-backed animations, while cofounders Liam O'Brien and Taliesin Jaffe have focused on the team's art, comics, and book publishing efforts. Creative director Marisha Ray remains in charge of programming, while Laura Bailey oversees merchandise.\n\nMatt Mercer, the team's chief creative officer, relinquished control of the main campaign stream earlier this year, but has been spearheading work on the tabletop game \"Daggerheart,\" the crew's answer to \"Dungeons and Dragons\" and the main product from Darrington Press, their game publishing business. Ashley Johnson leads the Critical Role Foundation, the team's nonprofit arm.\n\nLopez and Van Der Fluit work on the administrative end of things, from inking deals with brand partners to content development.\n\nVan Der Fluit said that in Critical Role's early days, working on smaller expansions, such as publishing comics, felt like natural extensions of the Twitch stream.\n\nThings have moved quickly since then, the duo said. The team began major projects, such as their two Amazon-backed animated series, at the five-year mark, when they thought it would've taken longer.\n\nThat project took off after Critical Role raised more than $11.3 million via Kickstarter in 2019, providing seed funding to create what would become \"The Legend of Vox Machina,\" their first Prime Video animated series.\n\n\"We have goalposts in terms of where we think we want to take the business, but we're not a traditional three, five, 10-year plan company,\" Lopez said. \"We kind of go with the flow, go with what our fans are asking for and what the community wants.\"\n\nThe team has a solid three-year roadmap for how they intend to grow \"Daggerheart,\" Critical Role's flagship game. It sold out worldwide in under a week after its launch in May.\n\n\"The amount of units that we ordered we thought was going to last us a year, and it lasted us literally two weeks,\" Lopez said. \"It's a great problem, it's a Champagne problem, but it's now changing our view in terms of what this product can be.\"\n\nDarrington Press this year hired Chris Perkins and Jeremy Crawford, two senior creatives formerly with Wizards of the Coast, the Hasbro-owned company that makes \"D&D.\"\n\n\"We've been good friends with them for quite a while, but the timing never really made sense until recently,\" Lopez said.\n\nIn November, months after Perkins and Crawford joined the team, Critical Role announced \"Daggerheart: Hope & Fear,\" the game's first expansion, which is scheduled for a summer 2026 release.\n\n\"We really want their creative juices brought to the world of 'Daggerheart.' That being said, we're also doing a bunch of 'D&D' stuff, and who better to bring in than the guys who used to do it?\" Lopez said.\n\nVan Der Fluit said Critical Role still has some \"boxes to tick\" in terms of collaborations. Critical Role has dealt in themed coffees and alcoholic beverages, but it plans to expand into the food and beverage sector.\n\n\"We continue to think about new markets and areas we can get into,\" Van Der Fluit said. \"We've never done something yet in the footwear space.\"\n\nLopez said the team's partnerships with Dark Horse Comics and Amazon have opened doors. But the cofounders don't just want to work with Fortune 500 companies; they want to find collaborators who \"vibe\" with them and understand how they want to work.\n\nLopez added that Critical Role loves being independent, and that there's a \"desire to keep it that way.\" But he did not rule out the possibility of taking private equity or venture capital funding to grow the business.\n\n\"If that opportunity does come, we'll be very prudent and very aware about what that might mean for us. But again, I think we aren't going to take money from a third party if we don't have a plan for it,\" Lopez said. \"We have to just make sure, if that opportunity does come up, that we feel like we can treat that money with the respect it deserves and do the cool things that we want to do with it.\"\n\nVan Der Fluit says he's focused on helping the team expand into video games. Critical Role is working with the Los Angeles indie game outfit AdHoc Studio on what will be the team's first video game.\n\n\"It is my job and Ben's job and Travis's job to kind of figure out, 'Hey, we can't do this forever, and we have to figure out how to give this business longevity,'\" Lopez said.\n\nHe added that fans of the show will see a wider variety of Critical Role content beyond what the founding cast have built, and new faces on the Critical Role stream who can \"continue the legacy.\"\n\nLopez added that there's been a renewed focus on the business end about reaching out to a younger audience, beyond viewers on Twitch and YouTube.\n\nStill, that doesn't mean Critical Role as we know it will be changing anytime soon.\n\n\"If they want to stream until they're 80, we'll do it,\" Lopez joked.",

    "title": "A 'jobless boom' is shaping up to be the story of the 2026 economy",
    "description": "Can't find a job, but keep hearing that the economy is strong? That might be the economic story of 2026.",
    "fullText": "The US economy continues to surprise on the upside — except when it comes to jobs.\n\nHot growth, as seen in this week's GDP report, typically corresponds to stronger hiring and personal earnings, which then enable consumers to continue spending. However, this year, the trend has been the opposite. Spending is driving the economy, but the job market is stuck in a \"Great Freeze.\"\n\nAs KPMG's chief economist Diane Swonk wrote on Tuesday, \"Growth and labor market outcomes have decoupled.\"\n\nIt's shaping up to be the story of 2026. The US has found itself in what some are calling a \"jobless boom.\" Money is flowing in and out of the economy at a healthy clip, but it's not going toward creating a new job for you.\n\nInstead, all eyes are on artificial intelligence, investment in which drove much of the year's economic growth, along with still-strong consumer spending. The big AI investors were larger companies, including those that have led white-collar job cuts. In some cases, their profits have skyrocketed, and \"do more with less\" has been the mantra of the year.\n\n\"Firms are doing more with fewer workers,\" Swonk wrote. \"Many overshot on staffing during the hiring frenzy and are now using attrition or layoffs to bring staffing levels \n\nEconomists are still grappling with how the US ended up in this rare scenario. This year, although overall layoffs have crept up, they remain relatively low. Corporate America and Big Tech were the exceptions, with companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Tesla announcing big cuts.\n\nBusiness Insider has heard from dozens of white-collar job seekers who said that finding a new role has felt \"impossible,\" and those with jobs have, in many cases, held onto them for dear life.\n\nIn addition to a tough job market, consumers had no income growth last quarter. However, spending held strong — despite tariff uncertainty and stubborn inflation still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. A large percentage of this spending uptick was in healthcare and medical services, as costs for hospital and nursing services climbed. This year marks the most Americans have spent on healthcare services since 2022, when the Omicron wave of COVID-19 spread.\n\nThis suggests that, despite strong spending by affluent households, much of this rise in consumer spending wasn't necessarily powered by confidence. In fact, consumer sentiment levels are among the lowest they have ever been, and many Americans have been cautious about spending because of tariff uncertainty.\n\nThe tough job market isn't helping. Unemployment is at 4.6%, the highest since 2021. Total job growth has stayed slow.\n\nDozens of job seekers across generations told Business Insider this year that they were frustrated about suspected ageism, cumbersome hiring processes, competition with hundreds of others for a single role, and the suspected role of AI in screening out their applications. Some told reporters they've applied for thousands of roles with no interviews, while others said it took well over a year to get a single offer, often at a lower pay than their previous job.\n\nIn his 2026 wish list for the business world, Business Insider's Dan DeFrancesco asked for \"ROI for AI.\"\n\n\"I just want to see some noticeable returns on all these massive AI projects,\" he wrote, referring to the eye-popping AI spending from Big Tech — and their plans for even more next year.\n\nIf that does come, the jobless boom may only grow. Companies want to use AI to boost productivity without hiring more people, which would only exacerbate a sluggish job market.\n\nAlthough it's difficult to determine if this year's investments in AI have yielded results, the GDP's spike to 4.3% in the third quarter is an encouraging sign overall. The largest growth since the third quarter of 2023 prompted President Donald Trump to say that the \"Trump Economic Golden Age is FULL steam ahead.\"\n\nStill, many Americans may worry about what this means for their jobs. Some companies have cited the need to be efficient in an AI-driven future as justification for layoffs. The US already operates with fewer jobs than it had pre-COVID, and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has recently said that the grim jobs data may be overstating this year's deflated gains.",

    "fullText": "An engineer at OpenAI says the company's hiring process can move from first contact to a signed offer in a week.\n\nJerene Yang, a team lead for synthetic data generation at OpenAI, said on an episode of the \"AI Across Borders\" podcast published Wednesday that her interview process was \"extremely quick, extremely efficient, and very no-nonsense.\"\n\nYang joined OpenAI's San Francisco office in October 2024. Before OpenAI, she was a senior engineering manager at Google, where she led Cloud Spanner and managed large-scale database systems, according to her LinkedIn profile.\n\nYang said a recruiter reached out to her on a Monday about a role leading a team that aligned with her background. She agreed to an initial conversation, which took place the following day with the hiring manager and technical lead.\n\nYang said one key part of the process was an interview round known as a \"technical deep dive\" — or a \"research discussion\" for research-focused roles.\n\nCandidates can choose a topic to discuss with a researcher. For engineering candidates, that often means walking through systems they have built, explaining the problems they were trying to solve, and describing the trade-offs behind key decisions.\n\n\"You really get to see the intellect of your interviewer as well and how much they know about your area,\" Yang said.\n\nBeyond technical skills, Yang said there is one skill candidates must master if they want to work at OpenAI: being \"brutally efficient\" with their time.\n\nWith many projects underway, employees need to focus only on work where their skills offer a clear advantage, she said.\n\nYang added that candidates should lean heavily on AI tools and think about task automation.\n\nAccording to OpenAI's interview guide, candidates typically go through résumé screening, introductory calls, skills-based assessments, and final interviews. The final interviews typically span four to six hours over one or two days.\n\nInterviews are designed to focus on candidates' areas of expertise and push them beyond their comfort zone, with an emphasis on problem-solving, communication, and collaboration, OpenAI said.",

    "description": "Kiana Mei, 20, runs a jewelry brand and opted out of college. It's tiring, isolating work, but she says she doesn't regret it.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kiana Mei, 20, a small-business owner from Australia. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I turned 15, like all my friends, I wanted to get a job at a café to earn money. But my father pushed me to start my company young, and it's the reason I'm now financially independent at 20.\n\nI started selling origami butterfly artwork, a skill I picked up from a school trip to Japan and honed during the COVID-19 lockdown.\n\nI started selling them at markets in Melbourne when I was 16. When I made my first sale to a lady who bought three of my artworks for $100, I was shocked. It was the first time I realized I could earn money with something I had made with my own hands.\n\nI added jewelry to the product mix not long after starting my company, Kiana Mei Designs, which sells affordable, customizable jewelry, as well as origami artworks.\n\nUntil the end of high school, I balanced school on weekdays and the markets on weekends. I passed my 12th grade with one of the highest grades in my school, which could qualify me for most college courses.\n\nBut I decided to go all in on my business for just one year, focusing on growing it instead of going to college. As I was running my business, I thought, \"What am I actually going to be studying in university that's related to business that I'm not already doing now?\"\n\nI now have a stall at Queen Victoria Market in Melbourne, open from Tuesday to Sunday. I've moved out of my parents' house, am financially independent, and don't regret anything.\n\nBut there are three things I wish I had known before diving headfirst into my business.\n\nThe first thing I wish I knew was the isolation I'd feel as a young business owner.\n\nI was still in school when I first started, so I had friends with whom I was quite close at the time, who shared similar academic interests.\n\nBut when I finished high school and moved out, and I started doing my own thing, those friends drifted away, and I wasn't as close with them anymore. We didn't have much in common.\n\nThere are not a lot of young business owners, especially in Melbourne and in Australia, and especially young female entrepreneurs. I've attended numerous networking events, but the people around me are a lot older than me, so it's harder to relate.\n\nI wish that I'd learned early on how to balance work and life, and how to switch off.\n\nLast Christmas, I think I was selling at my stall for 14 days straight without a break. The physical toll it takes is no joke — I think people don't really realize how taxing it can be on the body to stand all day.\n\nWhen I get sick and have a cold, I lose my voice completely. Last August, I lost my voice for five days, and that meant five days without work because I need to speak to customers.\n\nBut health always comes first, so I try to stay healthy.\n\nI make sure to get a workout in at 5 a.m., then eat a good breakfast before heading to the market. I go to bed around 10 p.m.\n\nIt's important to remember that your product isn't for everyone.\n\nI learned this in the very early days of my business. When customers would walk past my stall without talking to me, I used to feel a sense of rejection.\n\nI would think, \"Why didn't they stop?\" and I would overthink everything.\n\nWhen it comes to retail, you shouldn't overthink it, because not everyone will like your product, and not everyone will like you. You have to find the people who truly appreciate your products.\n\nOver time, I've come to accept that. When I'm at the market, of course, I'll try to speak to everyone, but if someone doesn't say hello back to me, or if someone doesn't want to stop and have a look, then it doesn't mean anything to me.\n\nIt's just on to the next person.",

    "description": "The billionaire said new grads can help small and medium businesses adopt AI agents, something big companies don't need them for.",
    "fullText": "Mark Cuban has advice for new graduates: Aim for the small companies.\n\nIn an X post on Wednesday, the billionaire investor and former \"Shark Tank\" star said that new graduates should seek jobs in small to medium-sized businesses, because that's where they can add the most value.\n\nCuban said new grads can teach SMBs \"how to use agents to optimize processes they couldn't take the time or afford to do manually.\"\n\n\"Big companies don't need new grads for this,\" he said. \"Entrepreneurial companies will love the value you add.\"\n\nHe said job hunters should be aware that AI agents are where new grads can add \"immediate value in ways the companies didn't know they needed.\"\n\nAI agents are virtual assistants that can complete tasks autonomously, from start to finish, without requiring user prompts.\n\nCompanies have doubled down on AI agents this year. A study of more than 400 companies by software engineering management service Jellyfish said that agentic AI adoption in these companies had risen from 50% in December 2024 to 82% in May.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in January, \"The age of agentic AI is here,\" and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman likened AI agents to junior employees.\n\nMorgan Stanley said in a November note that it expects AI shopping agents to add $115 billion to the US e-commerce industry by 2030.\n\nCuban's comments come during a challenging time for new graduates, who are entering a market with a low number of open roles.\n\nCalifornia-based employment company Handshake reported in May that job postings on its platform were down 15% compared to the previous year, and the number of applications per posting had increased by 30%.\n\nHandshake said that of all the full-time job applications it had received from new graduates, more than a third went to companies with 250 employees or fewer.\n\nAnd small companies are also trying to attract Gen Z graduates with something they value: the ability to work from home. Workplace researchers told Business Insider in July that these companies are offering flexible work arrangements to compete with big companies for top talent.",

(AP) — A strong storm system that brought relentless winds, rain and snowfall to California this week was expected to ease Friday, but there was still a risk of high surf along the coast, flash flooding near Los Angeles and avalanches in the Sierra Nevada.\n\nWaves near the San Francisco Bay Area could reach up to 25 feet (7.6 meters) Friday, parts of Southern California were at risk of flooding, and avalanches could hit the Lake Tahoe area, officials warned. Residents were told to be ready to evacuate the mountain town of Wrightwood about 80 miles (130 kilometers) northeast of Los Angeles because of mudslides.\n\nAtmospheric rivers carried massive plumes of moisture from the tropics during one of the busiest travel weeks of the year. The storms were blamed for at least two deaths earlier in the week.\n\nThe system brought the wettest Christmas season to downtown Los Angeles in 54 years, the National Weather Service said.\n\nRoads in the 5,000-resident town of Wrightwood were covered in rocks, debris and thick mud on Thursday. With power out, a gas station and coffee shop running on generators were serving as hubs for residents and visitors.\n\n“It’s really a crazy Christmas,” said Jill Jenkins, who was spending the holiday with her 13-year-old grandson, Hunter Lopiccolo.\n\nLopiccolo said the family almost evacuated the previous day, when water washed away a chunk of their backyard. But they decided to stay and still celebrated the holiday. Lopiccolo got a new snowboard and e-bike.\n\n“We just played card games all night with candles and flashlights,” he said.\n\nDavey Schneider hiked a mile and a half (1.6 kilometers) through rain and floodwater up to his shins from his Wrightwood residence Wednesday to rescue cats from his grandfather’s house.\n\n“I wanted to help them out because I wasn’t confident that they were going to live,” Schneider said Thursday. “Fortunately, they all lived. They’re all okay — just a little bit scared.”\n\nArlene Corte said roads in town turned into rivers, but her house was not damaged.\n\n“It could be a whole lot worse,” she said. “We’re here talking.”\n\nWith more rain on the way, more than 150 firefighters were stationed in the area, said San Bernardino County Fire spokesman Shawn Millerick.\n\n“We’re ready,” he said. “It’s all hands on deck at this point.”\n\nA falling tree killed a San Diego man Wednesday, news outlets reported. Farther north, a Sacramento sheriff’s deputy died in what appeared to be a weather-related crash.\n\nAreas along the coast, including Malibu, were under a flood watch until Friday afternoon, and wind and flood advisories were issued for much of the Sacramento Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nSouthern California typically gets half an inch to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 centimeters) of rain this time of year, but this week many areas could see between 4 and 8 inches (10 to 20 centimeters), with even \n\nMore wind and heavy snow was expected in the Sierra Nevada, where gusts created “near white-out conditions” and made mountain pass travel treacherous.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom declared emergencies in six counties to allow state assistance.\n\nThe state deployed resources and first responders to several coastal and Southern California counties, and the California National Guard was on standby.",

    "fullText": "A man tried to smuggle Gulf Coast box turtles from the United States to China. However, federal authorities thwarted the attempt.\n\nThe U.S. Customs and Border Protection as well as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife departments intercepted hundreds of box turtles at a border inspection in New York when they found the animals stuffed inside socks, placed inside boxes, and labeled as plastic toys.\n\nAccording to WOFL, officials discovered about 220 boxes containing 850 turtles that were en route to Hong Kong. The estimated market value for these turtles is approximately $1.4 million.\n\nAuthorities arrested the man responsible for the smuggling attempt, and he pleaded guilty to the charges in U.S. District Court in August.\n\nBox turtles are incredibly popular on the pet market, especially in Hong Kong and China. The illegal trafficking of animals for the pet market and other reasons is a billion-dollar industry, which makes some people feel the risk of trafficking is worth it.\n\nIn fact, this isn't the first time a New York resident has tried to traffic box turtles. A 26-year-old man from Brooklyn smuggled eastern box turtles and three-toed box turtles to China between 2019 and 2020. Authorities charged him with two counts of smuggling goods and one count of violating the Lacey Act, leading him to face up to 30 years in prison.\n\nTrafficking is a dangerous business for animals, as many are injured or killed during trafficking attempts, which contributes to the depletion of wildlife populations. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists many box turtle species as having decreasing populations, so the more that are trafficked, the worse off they'll be.\n\nAdditionally, when wildlife is trafficked from one country to another, it becomes an invasive species. Invasive species can pose significant problems, from introducing new diseases to reducing food security for other wildlife and people.\n\nAuthorities sent the turtles for rehabilitation, with the Brevard Zoo in Florida receiving nine of them. Wildlife experts expected the turtles to remain for a few months before being released back into the wild.\n\nOne visitor to Brevard Zoo told Fox 35 Orlando: \"I don't feel good about smuggling anything because I've heard about a lot of animals that have been smuggled. It doesn't do them any good. They just want to make the money.\"\n\nAs for the smuggler, HuffPost reported that the court will sentence the man Tuesday and that he faces up to five years in prison.\n\nDo you think America should produce more car parts than it does now?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "TOKYO (AP) — Japan's Cabinet on Friday approved a record defense budget plan exceeding 9 trillion yen ($58 billion) for the coming year, aiming to fortify its strike-back capability and coastal defense with cruise missiles and unmanned arsenals as tensions rise in the region.\n\nThe draft budget for fiscal 2026 beginning April is up 9.4% from 2025 and marks the fourth year of Japan’s ongoing five-year program to double annual arms spending to 2% of gross domestic product.\n\nThe increase comes as Japan faces elevated tension from China. Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said in November that her country's military could get involved if China were to take action against Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing says must come under its rule.\n\nTakaichi’s government, under U.S. pressure for a military increase, pledged to achieve the 2% target by March, two years earlier than planned. Japan also plans to revise the ongoing security and defense policy by December 2026 to further strengthen its military.\n\nMissiles and drones will add to southwestern island defense\n\nJapan has been bolstering its offensive capability with long-range missiles to attack enemy targets from a distance, a major break from its post-World War II principle limiting the use of force to own self-defense.\n\nThe current security strategy, adopted in 2022, names China as the country’s biggest strategic challenge and calls for a more offensive role for Japan’s Self-Defense Force under its security alliance with the U.S.\n\nThe new budget plan allocates more than 970 billion yen ($6.2 billion) to bolster Japan's “standoff” missile capability. It includes a 177 billion-yen ($1.13 billion) purchase of domestically developed and upgraded Type-12 surface-to-ship missiles with a range of about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles).\n\nThe first batch of the Type-12 missiles will be deployed in Japan's southwestern Kumamoto prefecture by March, a year earlier than planned, as Japan accelerates its missile buildup in the region.\n\nIn part due to Japan's aging and declining population and its struggles with an understaffed military, the government believes unmanned weapons are essential.\n\nTo defend the coasts, Japan will spend 100 billion yen ($640 million) to deploy “massive” unmanned air, sea-surface and underwater drones for surveillace and defense under a system called “SHIELD\" planned for March 2028, defense ministry officials said.\n\nFor speedier deployment, Japan initially plans to rely mainly on imports, possibly from Turkey or Israel.\n\nThe budget announcement comes as Japan’s row with China escalate following Takaichi's remark in November that Japanese military could get involved if China were to take action against Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing claims as its own.\n\nThe disagreement escalated this month when Chinese aircraft carrier drills near southwestern Japan prompted Tokyo to protest when Chinese aircraft locked their radar on Japanese aircraft, which is considered possible preparation for firing missiles.\n\nThe Defense Ministry, already been alarmed by China’s rapid expansion of operations in the Pacific, will open a new office dedicated to studying operations, equipment and other necessities for Japan to deal with China's Pacific activity.\n\nTwo Chinese aircraft carriers were spotted in June almost simultaneously operating near southern Japanese island of Iwo Jima for the first time, fueling Tokyo’s concern about Beijing’s rapidly expanding military activity far beyond its borders and areas around the disputed East China Sea islands.\n\nJapan plans joint development of frigates and jets\n\nJapan is pushing to strengthen its largely domestic defense industry by participating in joint development with friendly nations, and promoting foreign sales, after drastically easing arms export restrictions in recent years.\n\nFor 2026, Japan plans to spend more than 160 billion yen ($1 billion) to jointly develop a next-generation fighter jet with Britain and Italy for deployment in 2035. There also are plans for research and development of AI-operated drones designed to fly with the jet.\n\nIn a major boost to the country's defense industry, Australia selected Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in August to upgrade Mogami-class frigate to replace its fleet of 11 ANZAC-class ships.\n\nJapan's budget allocates nearly 10 billion yen ($64 million) to support industry base and arms sales.\n\nMeeting targets but future funding uncertain\n\nThe budget plan requires parliamentary approval by March to be implemented as part of a 122.3 trillion yen ($784 billion) national budget bill.\n\nThe five-year defense buildup program would bring Japan's annual spending to around 10 trillion yen ($64 billion), making it the world’s third-largest spender after the U.S. and China. Japan will clear the 2% target by March as promised, the Finance Ministry said.\n\nTakaichi’s government plans to fund its growing military spending by raising corporate and tobacco taxes and recently adopted a plan for income tax increase beginning 2027.

    "fullText": "ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) — Legislators in Algeria voted to declare France’s colonization of the North African country a crime, approving a law that calls for restitution of property taken by France during its 130-year rule, among other demands seeking to redress historical wrongs.\n\nFrance slammed the law as a “hostile act” threatening bilateral efforts to heal wounds of the past. The two countries retain close cultural and economic ties but have troubled diplomatic relations.\n\nIn a solemn ceremony steeped in symbolism, 340 of 407 members of Algeria’s National Assembly voted late Wednesday to approve the law. The move came just a few weeks after African countries made a collective resolution for recognition and reparations for colonial-era crimes.\n\nThe law covers the period from the landing of King Charles X’s army on the beaches of Sidi Ferruch west of Algiers in 1830 to July 5, 1962, the date of Algeria’s official independence.\n\nThe text provides for the restitution of Algerian archives and property moved to France during the colonial period, and the transmission to Algiers of detailed maps of French nuclear tests conducted in Algeria from 1960 to 1966. It also calls for the repatriation of the remains of some Algerian resistance fighters taken to France.\n\nThe law stipulates prison sentences for any action by an Algerian celebrating French colonialism, for attacks on symbols of the Algerian resistance, and “remarks with colonial connotations.”\n\nFrance is unlikely to heed the demands in the law.\n\nThe law is “a manifestly hostile initiative,” the French Foreign Ministry spokesperson's office said in a statement to The Associated Press. It noted efforts under French President Emmanuel Macron to address colonial-era grievances, and added: “We continue to work toward the renewal of dialogue,” notably about security and migration issues.\n\nMacron, in 2017, described elements of France’s history in Algeria as a crime against humanity, but stopped short of an official apology. Meanwhile, the resurgent far right in France celebrates colonialists.\n\nThe economic cost of colonialism in Africa is believed to be staggering. Algeria suffered some of the most brutal forms of French colonial rule.\n\nNearly a million European settlers held greater political, economic and social privileges, even though Algeria was legally part of France and its men were conscripted in World War II. Hundreds of thousands died in Algeria’s revolution, during which French forces tortured detainees, disappeared suspects and devastated villages as part of a counterinsurgency strategy to maintain their grip on power.\n\nHuge Algerian flags adorned the lower house of parliament as speaker Mohamed Boughali delivered his opening address Wednesday.\n\n“Today, December 24, 2025, is a historic day, to be written in letters of gold in the national narrative,” he began, before being interrupted by lawmakers intoning an excerpt from the Algerian national anthem: “O France, the hour of reckoning has arrived … we have sworn to revive Algeria, bear witness! Bear witness!”\n\nThe speaker called the law, ″a political message and an explicit moral stance.″\n\nGovernment officials, professors, and former members of parliament who championed the bill were all invited to the ceremony. As the speaker declared the law adopted, shouts of “Allahu Akbar!” and “Tahya Al Djazair!” (Long live Algeria!) rose from the floor.\n\n“This is a special day for me, full of emotion and pride. Today marks the culmination of a long struggle that we began in 2001 with fellow members of parliament, for the memory and honor of all those who fought against French colonization,” Mohamed Arezki Ferrad, a former lawmaker who initiated the bill, told the AP.\n\nThe law, which contains five chapters and 27 articles, declares that there is no statute of limitation on colonial-era crimes.",

    "description": "\"That has changed.\"",
    "fullText": "Graduates of Stanford's computer science program face difficulty finding jobs as artificial intelligence tools take over tasks once done by junior programmers, reported the Los Angeles Times.\n\nTech companies have changed the way they hire. Managers who once staffed projects with 10 junior coders now achieve the same productivity with a pair of senior developers and an AI assistant.\n\nA Stanford study found that jobs held by coders between the ages of 22 and 25 shrank by close to 20% after peaking at the end of 2022. The same research showed that positions exposed to AI competition saw 13% fewer new hires than roles less threatened by automation.\n\nStudents spoke to LA Times reporters and expressed that they weren't optimistic about searching for jobs. Many are staying at school an extra year to earn graduate degrees, hoping to delay their job hunt and build stronger credentials.\n\n\"That's been a dramatic reversal from three years ago, when all of my undergraduate mentees found great jobs at the companies around us,\" said Jan Liphardt, associate professor of bioengineering at Stanford. \"That has changed.\"\n\nThe change raises questions about workforce stability as AI capabilities grow.\n\nAt its 2022 debut, ChatGPT could only produce code in short bursts. Today's AI can churn out code over extended sessions with improved accuracy.\n\nAI's expansion strains energy sources, too. Training and running these models requires massive computing power, which increases electricity demand and water usage for cooling data centers. AI can help optimize clean energy grids, but its own resource consumption adds pressure to an already burdened infrastructure.\n\nFor young workers, the message is discouraging. A diploma from a prestigious school doesn't promise a job in fields where AI can handle basic tasks faster and cheaper.\n\nIf you're about to enter the workforce or have college-age children, consider how education might change.\n\nDo you worry about robots taking away our jobs?\n\nYes — but it will create new ones too\n\nPossibly — but not significantly\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nSome universities are rethinking curricula to prepare students to work with AI rather than compete against it.\n\nContact your elected officials to voice support for policies that address workforce displacement. Retraining programs and safety nets for workers in AI-affected industries could both be effective solutions.\n\nFor those already working in the tech space, focus on developing the skills AI presently struggles with: complex problem-solving, system design, and oversight of automated tools.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Doug Mills/The New York Times via AP, Pool\n\nPresident Donald Trump urged Democrats to “enjoy what may be your last Merry Christmas” in a cryptic message on Thursday.\n\n“Merry Christmas to all, including the many Sleazebags who loved Jeffrey Epstein, gave him bundles of money, went to his Island, attended his parties, and thought he was the greatest guy on earth,” wrote Trump, who was previously considered to be one of Epstein’s closest friends:\n\n…only to “drop him like a dog” when things got too HOT, falsely claimed they had nothing to do with him, didn’t know him, said he was a disgusting person, and then blame, of course, President Donald J. Trump, who was actually the only one who did drop Epstein, and long before it became fashionable to do so. When their names get brought out in the ongoing Radical Left Witch Hunt (plus one lowlife “Republican,” Massie!), and it is revealed that they are Democrats all, there will be a lot of explaining to do, much like there was when it was made public that the Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax was a fictitious story – a total Scam – and had nothing to do with “TRUMP.” The Failing New York Times, among many others, was forced to apologize for their bad and faulty Election “Reporting,” even to the point of losing many subscribers due to their highly inaccurate (FAKE!) coverage. Now the same losers are at it again, only this time so many of their friends, mostly innocent, will be badly hurt and reputationally tarnished. But sadly, that’s the way it is in the World of Corrupt Democrat Politics!!!\n\nHe concluded, “Enjoy what may be your last Merry Christmas! President Donald J. Trump.”\n\nThe president issued a separate Christmas message, lashing out at his political enemies on Christmas Eve.\n\n“Merry Christmas to all, including the Radical Left Scum that is doing everything possible to destroy our Country, but are failing badly,” Trump wrote. “We no longer have Open Borders, Men in Women’s Sports, Transgender for Everyone, or Weak Law Enforcement. What we do have is a Record Stock Market and 401K’s, Lowest Crime numbers in decades, No Inflation, and yesterday, a 4.3 GDP, two points better than expected.”\n\nHe also attacked late-night host Stephen Colbert in a Truth Social post on Tuesday, calling him a “dead man walking” and urging CBS to “put him to sleep.”\n\nThe post Trump Sends Cryptic Message to Democrats: ‘Enjoy What May Be Your Last Merry Christmas!’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

In Philadelphia, you can expect a mix of sleet and freezing rain with some snow. South Jersey and Delaware will transition to rain at some point overnight Friday.\n\nThe Philly area will start seeing precipitation around 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. on Friday, again moving west to east. Then, models predict the storm will move offshore sometime between 10 a.m. and noon on Saturday.\n\nModels vary about potential snow totals. But in general, forecasters predict between one and two inches of snow in northern Delaware, 1.5–4 inches in the Philadelphia area, and higher snow totals the further north you travel.\n\nPhiladelphia, according to the National Weather Service, has a nearly 30% chance of seeing 4 inches of snow/sleet or more by Satuday morning, with those chances being as high as 63% just 30 miles north in Trenton.\n\nIn addition to snow, experts predict large ice accumulation overnight Friday into Saturday, making streets and sidewalks dangerously slippery.\n\nThe National Weather Service says that people \"should consider delaying all travel\" until after the winter storm is over.\n\n\"If travel is absolutely necessary, drive with extreme caution,\" the NWS said, recommending travelers bring safety kits and other supplies in the event that they get stranded.\n\nInformation in this story is from FOX 29 meteorologist Sue Serio and the National Weather Service.",

    "fullText": "Bitcoin had a baby! Ethereum was born! And the Ethereum price is finally rebounding, up 3.9% over the last week.\n\nMoreover, year-end fate is about to be decided by derivatives, not headlines. Roughly $6 Bn in ETH options expire Friday, and despite call options outnumbering puts by more than 2.2 times, the structure still favors bears unless price can reclaim key levels fast. Here’s what to know:\n\nETH has failed to hold above $3,400 for more than 40 days, a stretch that has steadily drained bullish conviction. Most calls were placed between $3,500 and $5,000, reflecting expectations that Ether would close 2025 near $4,000 before the 28% November drawdown shattered that thesis.\n\nAs a result, more than $4.1 Bn in call options are now at risk of expiring worthless.\n\nDISCOVER: Top 20 Crypto to Buy in 2025\n\nPut positioning is more grounded. Bears clustered protection between $2,200 and $2,900 levels. If ETH settles between $2,700 and $2,900, puts win by roughly $580 Mn.\n\nEven a $2,901 to $3,000 close still favors bears by $440 Mn. Bulls only reach parity above $3,100, with a modest $150 Mn advantage emerging above $3,200.\n\nDerivatives flows explain the chop for the Ethereum price. ETH has hovered around $3,000 while dealers hedge exposure, keeping spot pinned inside a narrow band. If price holds above $2,950, more than 60% of $1.9 Bn in puts expire worthless, easing downside pressure but not flipping the trend outright.\n\nDISCOVER: Next 1000X Crypto: 10+ Crypto Tokens That Can Hit 1000x in 2025\n\nEthereum options activity shows traders rolling exposure into late-2025 and 2026 expiries rather than loading up on shorts for this week. Similar positioning appeared in mid-2023 and early 2024 before delayed breakouts materialized.\n\nMacro stress is adding caution. Additionally, weakness in US semiconductor manufacturing and softer AI-linked optimism have pushed traders toward hedges like bear put spreads and bear call spreads after repeated failures at $3,400.\n\nThe upshot is this: you are the Christmas miracle, Anon. You’re a beautiful and caring person and you have people who love you. Oh, and this week will be big for the ETH price; expect volatility.\n\nEXPLORE: Singapore Denies Do Kwon’s $14M Refund Demand For ‘Stolen’ Penthouse\n\nRead original story $6B Options Expiry Weighs on Ethereum Price by Isaiah Mccall at 99bitcoins.com",

    "fullText": "Nikhil Kamath, a renowned Indian billionaire, recently told CoinDCX CEO Sumit Gupta that he does not have a single Bitcoin to his name nor has he ever invested in other crypto. He clarified that he was not so familiar with the concept of cryptocurrencies, even though he interacts with some of the top players within the blockchain industry.\n\nDuring Kamath’s conversation with Gupta, the billionaire and co-founder of Zerodha hinted at his interest to pursue BTC by 2026, even though he has never owned Bitcoin before now. As someone who claims to have less knowledge about Bitcoin and other digital currencies, he says that he is open to learning about the space and exploring it further.\n\nThis revelation was made when CoinDCX CEO sought to know about Kamath’s views on blockchain and Bitcoin. His response may have come as a surprise to many people considering that Kamath has conversed with top leaders on his WTF podcast.\n\nThis includes top industry players like Elon Musk, Nandan Nilekani, Ruchir Sharma, Ray Dalio and many more.\n\nInterestingly, a handful of these entities are focused on blockchain and crypto, but it appears that Kamath did not tap from that aspect of their knowledge. He unashamedly admitted the limitation of his knowledge on the subject.\n\nDuring one of his podcasts with Musk, the Tesla boss equated Bitcoin with “energy,” which he believes to be the “true currency.”\n\nSome entities suspect that Kamath may just be taking a cautious stance on the subject of crypto, especially considering India’s position with digital assets. India once stated that it has no plans to regulate the crypto sector for now, citing concerns that it could expose the country’s financial system to risks.\n\nThe authorities in the region have agreed that a complete ban could tackle speculative activities, but at the same time, it wouldn’t prevent peer-to-peer transfers or decentralized trading.\n\nOn one hand, India has become more lenient towards the burgeoning crypto industry in recent months. Last October, Coinbase Global Inc., an American cryptocurrency exchange strengthened its presence in India and the Middle East by making a major investment in CoinDCX. This came 3 years after the same exchange exited the country.\n\nRead original story Indian Billionaire Nikhil Kamath Eyes Bitcoin Exposure in 2026 by Godfrey Benjamin at Coinspeaker.com",

Or that people aren’t interested in what he’s doing. And with Barron Trump being the only one of Trump’s kids living in the White House, people are also interested in his relationship with both his parents as well as his future.\n\nNow, reports indicate Barron will make his big-screen debut in his mother, Melania Trump’s, upcoming film, Melania. This was confirmed by his presence in the trailer, which drops January 30.\n\nBarron Trump's Dating Life Gets Controversial Update After Report Melania Is 'Furious' at His Leaked 'Private' Details\n\n'Furious' Melania Reportedly 'Exploded' at Pastor After He Leaked Barron's 'Private' Details-'It's Betrayal'\n\n“Everyone wants to know, so here it is,” Melania Trump says in the trailer as multiple clips of her preparing to become the first lady again play. Barron can be seen with her mother at one point, and at another point, waving to an audience.\n\nMELANIA, the film, exclusively in theaters worldwide on January 30th, 2026. pic.twitter.com/n2kloQ4JwW\n\n— MELANIA TRUMP (@MELANIATRUMP) December 17, 2025\n\nAll of this comes after some people close to the President suggested Barron could end up playing a large role in whatever happens to TikTok after he signed an executive order clearing the way for investors to operate a US version of the app. Former TikTok producer, Jack Advent, celebrated news of a deal to keep the app running in the United States with the suggestion that Barron could have a large role to play in the company.\n\n“President Trump delivered on his promise to save TikTok and the millions of Americans who run their businesses and get their unfiltered news through the app,” Advent told the Daily Mail.\n\n“Young people are overwhelmingly the user base of TikTok. I’m hopeful President Trump will consider appointing his son Barron and maybe other young Americans to TikTok’s board to help ensure it remains an app young people want to keep using,” he said.\n\nThere has been no announcement from the Trump administration regarding a possible role for Barron Trump with TikTok.\n\nRecently, however, there were reports that the youngest Trump was indeed interested in business. According to People, he is very focused on making a name for himself, and not romance, as some have speculated. “I don’t think that’s a big deal in his life right now,” sources told the outlet.\n\n“Barron has been actively working on his own financial interests and has spent time with others whom he is involved with in that area,” a source said. In fact, recent reports indicated he was looking to start his own real estate company. People reported that he “wants to follow in his dad’s footsteps,” and added, “He is interested in business in general, developing properties, making money, and being involved in successful projects.”\n\nAnd even though show business doesn’t seem to be of any particular interest to the youngest member of the Trump family, it seems like he will not shy away from it either way. We don’t know how big his role in his mother’s movie is, but since being in the spotlight has always been the way the Trump family has done business, his appearance is actually on par for the course.\n\nThe 26 Best Romantic Comedies to Watch if You Want to Know What Love Feels Like\n\nThese ‘Bachelor’ Secrets & Rules Prove What Happens Behind the Scenes Is So Much Juicier\n\nBTS's 7 Members Were Discovered in the Most Unconventional Ways",

    "description": "Saudi Arabia on Thursday called on Emirati-backed separatists in southern Yemen to withdraw from two governorates they now control, a move that has threatened to spark a confrontation within a fragile coalition that has been battling the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in the country's north.  The statement from Saudi Arabia's Foreign Ministry appeared aimed at putting public pressure on the Southern Transitional Council, a separatist Yemeni force long supported by the United Arab Emirates.",
    "fullText": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Saudi Arabia on Thursday called on Emirati-backed separatists in southern Yemen to withdraw from two governorates they now control, a move that has threatened to spark a confrontation within a fragile coalition that has been battling the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in the country's north.\n\nThe statement from Saudi Arabia's Foreign Ministry appeared aimed at putting public pressure on the Southern Transitional Council, a separatist Yemeni force long supported by the United Arab Emirates. Saudi Arabia backs the National Shield Forces of Yemen's internationally backed government in the war against the Houthis.\n\nThe separatists' actions have “resulted in an unjustified escalation that harmed the interests of all segments of Yemeni people, as well as the southern cause and the coalition’s efforts,” the ministry said. “The kingdom stresses the importance of cooperation among all Yemeni factions and components to exercise restraint and avoid any measures that could destabilize security and stability.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Houthis buried four of their fighters, including the group's top missile and drone commander who was presumed killed in March, in the first round of U.S. airstrikes to hit the rebels in March.\n\nThe Southern Transitional Council moved earlier this month into Yemen's governorates of Hadramout and Mahra. The Saudi statement said that mediation efforts were underway to have the council's forces return to “their previous positions outside of the two governorates and hand over the camps in those areas” to the National Shield Forces.\n\n“These efforts remain in progress,” the ministry said.\n\nThe local Hadramout governorate's authority said that it supported the Saudi announcement and called for the Emirati-backed separatists to withdraw to positions outside the governorates.\n\nThose aligned with the council have increasingly flown the flag of the flag of South Yemen, which was a separate country from 1967-1990. Demonstrators rallied on Thursday in the southern port city of Aden to support political forces calling for South Yemen to again secede from Yemen.\n\nFollowing the capture of Yemen's capital, Sanaa, and much of the country's north by the Houthis in 2014, Aden has been the seat of power for the internationally recognized government and forces aligned against the Houthi rebels.\n\nThe actions by the separatists have put pressure on the relationship between Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which maintain close relations and are members of the OPEC oil cartel, but also have competed for influence and international business in recent years.\n\nThere has also been an escalation of violence in Sudan, another nation in the Red Sea where the kingdom and the Emirates support opposing forces in an ongoing war.\n\nThe Houthis seized Sanaa in September 2014 and forced the internationally recognized government into exile. Iran denies arming the rebels, although Iranian-manufactured weaponry has been found on the battlefield and in sea shipments heading to Yemen despite a U.N. arms embargo.\n\nA Saudi-led coalition armed with U.S. weaponry and intelligence entered the war on the side of Yemen’s exiled government in March 2015. Years of inconclusive fighting have pushed the Arab world’s poorest nation to the brink of famine.\n\nThe war has killed more than 150,000 people, including fighters and civilians, and created one of the globe’s worst humanitarian disasters, killing tens of thousands more.\n\nThe Houthis have launched attacks on hundreds of ships in the Red Sea corridor over the Israel-Hamas war, greatly disrupting regional shipping.\n\nWhile traffic has inched up recently in the lull in attacks, many shippers continue to go around Africa through the Cape of Good Hope to avoid the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.\n\nFurther chaos in Yemen could again draw in the United States.\n\nWashington launched an intense bombing campaign targeting the rebels earlier this year that U.S. President Donald Trump halted just before his trip to the Middle East in October. The Biden administration also conducted strikes against the Houthis, including using B-2 bombers to target what it described as underground bunkers used by the Houthis.\n\nIn Sanaa, crowds gathered as uniformed men carried coffins draped in Yemen’s flag and topped with flowers during the funerals for the four Houthi fighters.\n\nThe dead fighters include Maj. Gen. Zakaria Abdullah Yahya Hajar, whom analysts identified as the group’s drone and missile chief. U.S. forces reportedly targeted Hajar, who allegedly received training from the expeditionary Quds Force of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, in a strike in March in Sanaa.\n\nThe Houthis provided no information on how or when he died. However, a transcript of a discussion between top American officials on the messaging app Signal later published by The Atlantic magazine included then national security adviser Mike Waltz referencing the initial March 15 attack targeting a Houthi missile commander.\n\n“The first target — their top missile guy — we had positive ID of him walking into his girlfriend’s building and it’s now collapsed,” Waltz wrote at the time.\n\nThe Houthis have increasingly threatened Saudi Arabia and taken dozens of workers at U.N. agencies and other aid groups as prisoners, alleging without evidence that they were spies — something fiercely denied by the United Nations and others.",

    "fullText": "Dak Prescott falls 1 game shy of Tony Romo’s record Cowboys streak after beating Commanders appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nThe Dallas Cowboys are not going to the playoffs this season, but they had enough gas in the tank to ruin Christmas Day for the Washington Commanders. The Cowboys pulled off a 30-23 road victory over their long-time rivals, and quarterback Dak Prescott threw for 307 yards and 2 touchdowns in the win.\n\nThe Cowboys jumped in front early and built a 21-3 lead midway through the second quarter before the Commanders did enough to make it a close game in the second half. However, the Commanders never threatened the lead.\n\nThe Cowboys (7-8-1) have a chance to finish the season at .500 if they can beat the New York Giants in the season finale, while the Commanders (4-12) will close against the NFC East champion Philadelphia Eagles. The Commanders made it all the way to the NFC title game a year ago, but this season has been a disaster for head coach Dan Quinn.\n\nWhile Prescott was able to impose his will on the Washington defense, he saw his streak of completing 60 percent or more of his passes come to an end at 15 games. Prescott completed 19 of 37 passes for 51.4 percent. If Prescott had been able to complete 60 percent of his passes against Washington, he would have passed Tony Romo for the longest streak in Cowboys history.\n\nWhile Prescott was able to make his share of big plays, the Dallas ground game came through with a couple of big performances. Second-year running back Malik Davis carried the ball 20 times for 103 yards. The Cowboys also received a complementary showing from Javonte Williams as he had 13 carries for 54 yards and a touchdown.\n\nKaVontae Turpin provided a huge highlight for the Cowboys when he used his speed to streak through the Washington secondary and catch an 86-yard TD pass from Prescott in the second quarter. The scoring play was the only reception of the game by the 4-year veteran from TCU.",

    "fullText": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — The Denver Broncos placed center Luke Wattenberg on injured reserve before their game against the Kansas City Chiefs on Thursday night, a surprising and significant blow to their offensive line as they take aim at a postseason berth.\n\nWattenberg had started the first 15 games of the season before showing up on the injury report with a shoulder problem this week. The move to the IR means he will be out at least four weeks, which would take the Broncos though the AFC title game.\n\nTheir first order of business is winning the AFC West. They can do it this weekend with a win over the Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium and by getting some help from Houston with a victory over the Chargers in Los Angeles on Saturday.\n\nWattenberg, a fifth-round pick in the 2022 draft out of Washington, has been solid in the middle for the Broncos all season. And last month, the team rewarded the 28-year-old offensive lineman with a four-year, $48 million contract extension.\n\nAlex Forsyth was starting in his place against Kansas City. He played four games when Wattenberg was injured last season.\n\nThe Broncos also promoted tight end Marcedes Lewis and offensive lineman Calvin Throckmorton, promoted linebacker Levelle Bailey and wide receiver Michael Bandy, and waived running back Cody Schrader amid a flurry of roster moves Thursday.\n\nThe 41-year-old Lewis was signed in late October and has appeared in four games for Denver. He's providing some depth at tight end while Nate Adkins continues to deal with a lingering knee injury.\n\nBailey is providing depth with linebacker Dre Greenlaw out with a hamstring injury, and Bandy is doing the same at wide receiver, where the Broncos are missing rookie Pat Bryant in the concussion protocol.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "fullText": "Is Lamar Jackson playing this week? Latest news, updates on Ravens QB's status for Week 17 against Packers originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens have had a disastrous year, with a campaign that began with Super Bowl aspirations quickly devolving into a frustrating December defined by injuries, losses, and mounting questions about the franchise's future. Now, with their playoff hopes hanging by the thinnest of threads, their biggest star is severely hobbled, as two-time MVP quarterback Lamar Jackson is battling a painful back contusion that has kept him out of practice for the second consecutive day.\n\nThe back injury, sustained in Sunday night's loss to the New England Patriots, is described by Head Coach John Harbaugh as a \"legitimate, very painful\" deep-tissue bruise. Jackson's status for Saturday's must-win, elimination-game matchup against the Green Bay Packers has cast a massive shadow over Baltimore's already slim chances.\n\nHere's the latest updates on the two-time MVP and his status for Saturday night in Green Bay.\n\nMORE: What Lamar Jackson's injury means for Ravens QB room\n\nJackson's status was up in the air and he is now considered doubtful for the Ravens matchup against Green Bay.\n\nRavens QB Lamar Jackson is listed as doubtful for Saturday night’s game at Green Bay. If Jackson cannot play, Ravens QB Tyler Huntley would start. pic.twitter.com/roSob7UVGw\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) December 25, 2025\n\nJackson missed three games earlier this season due to a hamstring injury, which set the tone for a frustrating year of recurring physical setbacks that have clearly impacted his play and the team's fortunes. Beyond the hamstring and his current, painful back contusion, the two-time MVP has also dealt with nagging issues involving his knee, toe, and ankle throughout the campaign.\n\nThe lower-body ailments have prevented Jackson from showcasing his signature electric dual-threat ability; his rushing yardage is on pace for a career-low and he has appeared noticeably less explosive, suggesting the constant battle with injury has been a major factor in the Ravens' disappointing skid.\n\nIn his absence, Tyler Huntley would get the start\n\n*This story will be updated with the latest available information.\n\nMORE: ESPN Insider says Ravens should consider moving on from Lamar Jackson\n\nJackson sustained a deep-tissue back contusion late in the first half of the Ravens' recent loss to the New England Patriots after he was kneed in the back by a defender while going to the ground.  Harbaugh confirmed the injury is \"legitimate, very painful\" and has caused the muscles around the area to lock up, severely limiting the two-time MVP's ability to move.\n\nThe #Ravens are listing QB Lamar Jackson (back) as doubtful for Saturday night’s game vs. the Packers.\n\nTyler Huntley will start if he can’t go. Baltimore is eliminated with a loss. pic.twitter.com/03kPxbe8fI\n\n— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) December 25, 2025\n\nAs a result of the painful bruise, Jackson has been unable to practice this week and has been officially listed as doubtful for the critical Saturday night game against the Green Bay Packers. The team is reliant on Tyler Huntley, who has been preparing to start, as a loss would eliminate the Ravens from playoff contention.\n\nMORE: Update on the chase for the AFC's No. 1 seed",

    "description": "Player grades for the Oklahoma City Thunder's 117-102 loss to the San Antonio Spurs.",
    "fullText": "OKLAHOMA CITY — As OKC fans filed out in the final moments to save some daylight on Christmas, an assembly of San Antonio fans parked near their favorite team's bench took over. A 'Go Spurs Go!' chant could be audibly heard as the final buzzer sounded.\n\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder had their world shaken in their 117-102 loss to the San Antonio Spurs. That's three consecutive defeats handed to them by that squad in the last two weeks.\n\nPlaying on Christmas for the first time, the Thunder looked like a team ready to avenge their most embarrassing loss yet, less than 48 hours later. Jalen Williams had things going. So did Chet Holmgren. The Spurs weren't rattled, though. De'Aaron Fox kept their composure. San Antonio couldn't miss any of its looks.\n\nEventually, the Thunder were in a 41-36 deficit after the first quarter. Allowing 75% shooting, the league-best defense looked completely out of character. The Spurs had plenty of drive-first scorers who sliced through OKC's defense. Little bit of deja vu.\n\nThe scary part was, Victor Wembanyama hardly played. You know, the guy universally viewed as a top-five player who completely changes the geometry in the halfcourt? He continues to be in a bench role as he works his way back from a calf strain.\n\nThe Thunder eventually cooled off, but the Spurs didn't. Alex Caruso was dared to beat them from the outside. He missed eight outside attempts in nine minutes. They only put up 24 points in the second frame as they entered halftime in a 69-60 deficit to San Antonio.\n\nThe second half was much of the same story. Stephon Castle threw an elementary alley-oop to Luke Kornet in the early stages to push their lead to double-digit points. The Spurs had it too easy going to the paint. Harrison Barnes continues to be pesky against OKC as he sliced through their defense for an easy layup.\n\nOn the other end, the Thunder offense once again regressed. Badly. Anytime the ball was out of Gilgeous-Alexander's hands, that was a small victory. They clanked outside look after outside look. A 19-point third frame had them in a 95-79 hole.\n\nA quick start to the fourth quarter provided some hope. Isaiah Joe made an outside bucket to cut it within nine points with a little over eight minutes to go. Alas, that'd be the closest it'd get the rest of the way. Wembanyama drilled in a demoralizing outside jumper that OKC had no chance to actually contest. The rest of the Spurs also helped out with timely buckets.\n\nThe Thunder only scored 23 points in the final frame. That wasn't enough to overcome a double-digit deficit. Eventually, they waved the white flag and cleared their bench. For the first time since Game 1 of the 2025 NBA Finals, the OKC home crowd left in a bad mood.\n\nThe Thunder shot 39% from the field and went 11-of-44 (25%) from 3. They shot 17-of-25 on free throws. They had 23 assists on 37 baskets. Five Thunder players scored double-digit points.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander was limited to 22 points and six rebounds. Williams had a quiet 12 points and six assists. Holmgren tallied 10 points and 12 rebounds. Isaiah Hartenstein totaled 13 points and 12 rebounds. Caruso finished with 12 points on 13 shot attempts.\n\nMeanwhile, the Spurs shot 54% from the field and went 11-of-29 (37.9%) from 3. They shot 16-of-21 on free throws. They had 20 assists on 45 baskets. Five Spurs players scored double-digit points.\n\nWembanyama had 19 points and 11 rebounds off the bench. Fox finished with an efficient 29 points on 12-of-19 shooting and four rebounds. Castle had 18 points and seven assists. Barnes finished with 15 points and six rebounds. Dylan Harper helped with 12 points off the bench.\n\nWell, the Thunder officially have a Spurs problem. Three games in two weeks show that they're a matchup nightmare. Just by eyeballing, you can tell they're a tick faster and more athletic than OKC. That small advantage has been painfully noticeable. The defense has been beaten at all three levels. When you're this defensively reliant, you can't let that happen.\n\nA lot can happen from now to the NBA playoffs. After all, it's only December. But the Thunder have been slapped with reality for the first time in a while. Over one-third of the way through the regular season, San Antonio looks to be the first piece of Kryptonite that has risen from the field against the reigning NBA champion.\n\nLet's look at Thunder player grades:\n\nWith the final result unofficially decided, Gilgeous-Alexander's last shot attempt hit the front of the rim. A pull-up 3-pointer failed to go in despite it being a quality look, as a screen wiped out Castle. That was a pretty poetic way to end a forgettable Christmas Day debut for the reigning MVP.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander finished with 22 points on 7-of-19 shooting, six rebounds and four assists. He shot 1-of-6 from 3 and went 7-of-8 on free throws. He also had a steal.\n\nFor really the first time, the Spurs slowed down Gilgeous-Alexander's unreal superb scoring production. Usually automatic in the mid-range, San Antonio crashed down several defenders at him as soon as he pulled up. Same with his outside jumper.\n\nAs Wembanyama roamed the paint like an 'Attack on Titan' character, Gilgeous-Alexander hesitated to get to the rim. It's one thing when it's just him; it's another when the Spurs are also loaded with perimeter defenders that can keep up with his footwork. At that point, that's too many problems to solve.\n\nThe Thunder have relied on the same formula in their NBA dominance over the last two seasons — Gilgeous-Alexander constantly puts up an efficient 30-plus points while the rest of the roster shuts down the opponent on the other end. When both of those variables are off, like they were here, then this is the result.\n\nMade the space for the Step🔙\n\nVote Shai on 3x1 Vote Day 💫 https://t.co/0HE3nd0kPx pic.twitter.com/CwnJu6Tufr\n\n— OKC THUNDER (@okcthunder) December 25, 2025\n\nSteal 🤝 Score pic.twitter.com/BubxjWWXVk\n\n— OKC THUNDER (@okcthunder) December 25, 2025\n\nGoing at Kornet, Williams sped up to get by the Spurs' starting center. He lolipopped his way to an underhanded layup. That first bucket felt like we were about to see the All-NBA player wash away a forgettable outing just a couple of days ago against the same squad. Never mind about that.\n\nWilliams finished with 12 points on 5-of-13 shooting, six assists and two rebounds. He shot 1-of-2 from 3 and went 1-of-4 on free throws. He also had two steals.\n\nEarly on, Williams teased us with a vintage performance. He drove to the basket for a layup. He nailed a couple of mid-range jumpers. He even swished in a pull-up 3-pointer. Alas, his nine points in the opening frame proved to be three-fourths of his point production.\n\nAs the game progressed, Williams faded into the background as a scorer. His pull-up jumper abandoned him mid-game. The Spurs forced him to second-guess himself. By the end, he joined a long list of OKC players who looked like they forgot how to play to their formula of basketball success.\n\nWhile the offense wasn't the side of the ball to blame, the Thunder need more from Williams. It's disappointing to see him lay a second consecutive egg against the Spurs. They brought home an NBA championship because he broke out as an efficient 20-plus scorer. That version of him has yet to be seen on a consistent basis.\n\nOffense heatin' up early \n\nVote Thunder on 3x1 vote day 🌟 https://t.co/0HE3nd0kPx pic.twitter.com/RnUFXHi6Au\n\n— OKC THUNDER (@okcthunder) December 25, 2025\n\nRicocheting a free-throw attempt, Holmgren's miss had Wembanyama pumped up. ESPN's hot mics caught the latter flexing his muscles and high-fiving his teammate on the missed attempt. Once again, Holmgren was quiet with the Spurs across from him.\n\nHolmgren finished with 10 points on 5-of-9 shooting, 12 rebounds and two assists. He shot 0-of-2 from 3 and went 0-of-2 on free throws. He also had a block.\n\nFor the first time since last season, the Thunder have gone from a defensive leakage to a full-blown problem. The Spurs did much of the same two days later. They attacked OKC's defense. Armed with several players who could put the ball down and attack, they went on to have 52 points inside the paint on 59% shooting.\n\nThat's just not going to cut it. The Thunder need more from Holmgren. He's the face of their interior defense. They don't have enough offensive juice to go bucket for bucket. You can complain that the seven-footer isn't an aggressive enough scorer, but this is who he is at this point in his career.\n\nWe'll see if the Thunder can eventually figure things out. April is still a long way away from the games actually mattering. But the game tape they've put up in these two losses is downright alarming. A matchup against the Spurs has made OKC's gaudy defense look pedestrian for the first time in forever.\n\nCompletely left wide open, Caruso had several good looks from the corner. Clank. Clank. Clank. The onomatopoeia echoed throughout the OKC crowd. Hand-delivered several quality looks, OKC's role players let it slip through their fingers and bailed the Spurs out.\n\nCaruso finished with 12 points on 3-of-13 shooting and one rebound. He shot 2-of-12 from 3 and went 4-of-4 on free throws. He also had one block.\n\nThe Spurs join the long list of teams over the years that have deployed that strategy. As awesome as Caruso is on the defensive end, his inconsistent outshot shot is equally a disadvantage. That's a theme throughout the Thunder's roster. Same goes for guys like Cason Wallace and Lu Dort.\n\nThe Thunder simply don't have enough real shooters to force teams to play honestly with them in the halfcourt. They won an NBA championship in spite of it. But that was because they played all-time great defense to ugly up the game. If they're not bringing that level of defense, then they look more vulnerable.\n\nWe've known that for years, though. The Thunder consciously made that trade-off when constructing this championship roster. Any slippage on that end, though, exposes them to losses like these. It's still a long way away, but it feels like OKC will need to win close, low-scoring games once again in the playoffs.\n\nThis article originally appeared on OKC Thunder Wire: Player grades: Thunder officially have Spurs problem after 117-102 loss",

    "description": "The Broncos face the Chiefs in Kansas City on Christmas. We break down what the game means for the NFL playoff picture in Week 17.",
    "fullText": "When the NFL schedule makers sat down to craft the Christmas slate of games, they likely envisioned the clash between the Denver Broncos and Kansas City Chiefs as a battle for the AFC West title.\n\nWhile the Chiefs have already been eliminated from playoff contention, the Broncos can wrap up their first AFC West title since 2015 with a win tonight, and a little bit of help from the Houston Texans on Saturday. In addition, Denver can also secure the No. 1 seed in the AFC, but they will need a little more help here in Week 17 to clinch the top seed.\n\nLet’s start with the AFC West title. Denver can clinch the division title this week, officially bringing to an end the Chiefs’ reign atop the division. With a win over the Chiefs on Christmas night, and a Los Angeles Chargers loss or tie against the Houston Texans on Saturday, the Broncos are AFC West champions.\n\nDenver can also clinch the AFC West with a tie against the Chiefs, provided the Chargers lose to the Texans.\n\nIn addition, Denver can also wrap up the No. 1 seed in the AFC this week, and the lone bye week in the AFC playoffs.\n\nBut they would need a lot of help to get that done.\n\nFirst, the Broncos would need to win against the Chiefs on Thursday night. Then, the Broncos would need the New England Patriots to lose to the New York Jets, the Chargers to lose or tie against the Texans, the Jacksonville Jaguars to lose or tie against the Indianapolis Colts, and the Buffalo Bills to lose or tie against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nWith the Chiefs already eliminated from the playoffs, this game will not have any tiebreaker implications for the Chiefs and Broncos directly.\n\nBut it could play a role for the Broncos when it comes to seeding, in a very narrow scenario.\n\nLooking at the AFC West, the Broncos lead the division with a 12-3 record, while the Chargers are in second place with an 11-4 record. If Denver beats the Chiefs and the Chargers beat the Texans on Saturday, the two teams will meet in Week 18 with the division title up for grabs.\n\nWhy? Because the Chargers against Denver earlier this season, and another win in Week 18 in this scenario, would see the two teams finish at 13-4. The first tiebreaker in a division is head-to-head record, which woudl give the Chargers the AFC West title.\n\nThen the Broncos would be seeded somewhere from No. 5 to No. 7, depending on how the Bills finish, who could also end the year with a 13-4 record. If, again in this scenario, the Bills finish with the same 13-4 record as Denver, the tiebreaker will be conference record. Right now, Buffalo is at 8-3, and they have one AFC game remaining so they would finish at 9-3 in this scenario.\n\nDenver right now has a 7-3 record in AFC games, and would finish at 8-4 in this scenario, dropping them behind the Bills.\n\nAgain, this is a very specific hypothetical, but this game could matter in a tiebreaker scenario.",

    "description": "The New York Mets have some work to do to replace star slugging first baseman Pete Alonso’s production after he signed a five-year contract with the Baltimore Orioles.",
    "fullText": "The New York Mets have some work to do to replace star slugging first baseman Pete Alonso’s production after he signed a five-year contract with the Baltimore Orioles.\n\nWith the offseason focus being run prevention, the team has opted to risk offense for better defense, hence why Alonso wasn’t even given an offer by New York. The Mets have brought in several players who are known for their defense and got rid of several players who aren’t known for their defensive prowess.\n\nImproving the defense and pitching staff is always good, but Mets brass might not understand just how much Alonso did for this offense. He averaged 42 home runs and 114 RBI and is extremely durable. He is the franchise leader in home runs with 264.\n\nInfielder Jorge Polanco was signed to a two-year, $40 million contract and the expectation is that he will split time between first base and designated hitter. Polanco is a fine player and a solid defender, however, he’s played one inning of one game at first base in his whole career.\n\nReports suggest that the Seattle Mariners were prepping Polanco for a move to first base but never made the switch because there was nobody to replace Polanco at second base. Third baseman Mark Vientos is the other player who is projected to see time at first base, but there is a premier Japanese slugger who is a versatile corner infield/outfielder that would be a perfect fit for the Mets.\n\nProlific home run hitter Kazuma Okamoto was posted to Major League Baseball free agency by the Yomiuri Giants of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) on Nov. 20 and has until Jan. 4, 2026 to sign with an MLB team. MLB.com’s Mark Feinsand named the Mets a potential fit to land the 29-year-old superstar.\n\n“A decorated slugger in Japan, Okamoto will be posted by the Yomiuri Giants this winter, making him available to big league clubs,” Feinsand wrote Tuesday. “Okamoto, who became a full-time player with the Giants in 2018, is a six-time NPB All-Star who has won three home run titles, though there will be questions about his ability to hit higher-velocity pitchers in the Majors. The 29-year-old has 248 career home runs in 1,074 games with Yomiuri, including six consecutive 30-homer campaigns between 2018-23. Okamoto has played more third base than first in Japan, though it’s unclear how Major League teams will view him at the hot corner.”\n\nOkamoto’s versatility would allow for the Mets to play him, Polanco and Vientos at the same time in different ways depending on matchups. If the rumored projected contract for Okamoto is accurate (four-year, $64 million), the Mets have plenty of funds to get a deal done if there is mutual interest.",

    "description": "Despite the loss, several players stood out for the Commanders in the Christmas Day loss to the Cowboys.",
    "fullText": "The Washington Commanders fell to 4-12 on the season, losing to the Dallas Cowboys 30-23 on Christmas Day in the home finale at Northwest Stadium.\n\nIt was an ugly start for the Commanders, allowing Dallas to score on all four of its first-half possessions. Rookie running back Jacory Croskey-Merritt did his part to keep the Commanders in the game, rushing for 105 yards on 11 carries and scoring two touchdowns, including a 72-yard run in the third quarter.\n\nWith Jayden Daniels and Marcus Mariota both out, veteran quarterback Josh Johnson made his first NFL start since 2021, completing 15 of 23 passes for 198 yards. Johnson played as well as can be expected, only putting the ball in harm's way one time. He did not turn the ball over. The problem for the Commanders was that they only ran 41 offensive plays, compared to 87 for the Cowboys.\n\nSo, which players shined in defeat for Washington? Who struggled? Let's look at the Week 17 edition of studs and duds.\n\nBill didn't have a lot of touches, again, Washington had only 41 offensive plays, but he made them count. Croskey-Merritt had a two-touchdown day, with his first touchdown run an impressive 10-yarder, in which he made some moves at the line of scrimmage. He could have had a third touchdown run, but lost his footing inside the 10-yard line. Croskey-Merritt now has 776 rushing yards and eight touchdowns, averaging 4.8 yards per carry. And he has done it with limited opportunities. That's not bad for a seventh-round pick.\n\nBILL TAKES IT 72 YARDS TO THE HOUSE\n\nDALvsWAS on @Netflix pic.twitter.com/5I9On67tbI\n\nIt's been an up-and-down year for the second-year cornerback. While Sainristil did break up a potential touchdown pass in the end zone, he gave up several catches and missed some key tackles.\n\nSainristil having a HORRIBLE game. Here is misses a tackle pic.twitter.com/CqjRl4uJX2\n\n— Mark Tyler (Hogs Haven) (@Tiller56) December 25, 2025\n\nOn Washington's first drive, Deebo Samuel had a 41-yard catch-and-run where he trucked over Dallas safety Donovan Wilson. Samuel had another 27-yard reception, where he stiff-armed Cowboys cornerback Trevon Diggs to the ground. Samuel finished with 68 receiving yards and 25 rushing yards on only four touches. Samuel's performance against the Cowboys is exactly what Washington envisioned when trading for him last offseason. Samuel has had a good season, but has had to play more of a traditional receiver role for much of the year due to the Commanders' injuries at receiver. An impactful day for Deebo.\n\nOH MY, DEEBO.\n\nDALvsWAS on @Netflix pic.twitter.com/kUXeh1JJbJ\n\nRemember how linebacker Frankie Luvu was supposed to be even better in his second season for the Commanders? That feels like years ago. Luvu was so good in his first year in Washington that he was named second-team All-Pro. He was expected to have an even bigger year in 2025, especially rushing the passer. That never happened. Luvu's numbers across the board are down; he has only three sacks and missed tackles have been a recurring issue. In this game, Von Miller sacked Dak Prescott on a third-and-9, which would have forced the Cowboys to either punt or attempt a long field goal. Instead, Luvu was flagged, the Cowboys had an automatic first down and eventually kicked a field goal. That made it 27-17.\n\nIt was a career day for the second-year defensive tackle. With Daron Payne out, Newton took advantage of his opportunity, finishing with nine tackles, including two for loss, three sacks and five quarterback hits. Newton was an active presence all game and clearly Washington's most impactful pass rusher. This is the type of performance the Commanders have been waiting on from Newton and the hope is he can finish strong next week against the Eagles.\n\nNewton with his 2nd sack of the game pic.twitter.com/qdcl3Q1Rkn\n\n— Mark Tyler (Hogs Haven) (@Tiller56) December 25, 2025\n\nFor as much as we have blasted Washington's pass defense, the Cowboys rushed for 211 yards, averaging 4.8 yards per carry. Dallas was picking up big yardage on simple draw plays. On one third-and-8, fullback Hunter Luepke took the handoff from Prescott and picked up the eight yards needed for the first down. It was one of a series of embarrassing plays from Washington's defense. The run defense was better in the second half, but that's a low bar. Overall, it was a pathetic effort.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: Studs and duds from Christmas loss to Cowboys",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs will square off against the Denver Broncos on Christmas Day in Week 17, and neither Patrick Mahomes nor Gardner Minshew will be under center for the defending AFC champions.\n\nMahomes and Minshew are out for the year with knee injuries, meaning Kansas City is turning to Chris Oladokun to be the starter for the rest of the season.\n\nOladokun saw his first NFL game action last week versus the Tennessee Titans, but he is still a fresh face to many. Let's meet the Chiefs' starting quarterback replacing Mahomes and Minshew.\n\nOladokun played six seasons of college football from 2016 to 2021, including three at South Florida, two at Samford, and one at South Dakota State. Though he received eight starts with Samford in 2019, his lone season as a full-time starter came in 2021, his final year in college, with South Dakota State.\n\nDuring the 2021 campaign with the Jackrabbits, Oladokun tossed 25 touchdowns to just seven interceptions, leading South Dakota State to an 11-4 record.\n\nAfter a successful season with the Jackrabbits, Oladokun headed to the NFL, where he was a seventh-round pick in the 2022 NFL Draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was released by Pittsburgh during final cuts and found a home in Kansas City afterwards.\n\nOladokun has been with the Chiefs since, winning two Super Bowls on the practice squad. He made his first NFL appearance against the Broncos in 2024, but his true debut came in Week 16 of the 2025 campaign versus the Titans.\n\nIn Tennessee last week, Oladokun completed 11 of 16 passes for 116 yards in Kansas City's blowout loss. The 28-year-old will now get his first career start in Week 17 against the Broncos at Arrowhead.\n\nLamar Jackson Rumor puts Ravens QB in play for Raiders in 2026\n\nT.J.

    "fullText": "Spurs record vs. Thunder: San Antonio extends winning streak over OKC with blowout victory on Christmas Day originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nLed by Victor Wembanyama, the Spurs have embraced the challenge of facing off against the league's best side -- the Thunder -- in 2025.\n\nThe reigning champions have proven a tough out for the league's other 28 teams, downing all but two of their opponents across 28 non-San Antonio opponents.\n\nBut against Wembanyama and San Antonio, that record looks far more wretched. Oklahoma City is yet to claim a win over the Spurs in three appearances. And with back-to-back blowout wins against their fearsome foes, San Antonio doesn't look intimidated by all the Thunder have accomplished so far.\n\nWith that, here's what you need to know about the Spurs' record vs. Oklahoma City this season.\n\nMORE: Victor Wembanyama-Thunder beef, explained\n\nWith its win on Christmas, San Antonio moved to 3-0 against the Thunder this season. That mark grows more impressive when you consider that the defending NBA champions have a 26-2 record against all other foes.\n\nThe Spurs outgunned their highly-touted opposition, sinking 45-of-84 field goal attempts (53.5%) en route to a 15-point win.\n\nWembanyama shimmered as he usually does, producing 19 points, 11 rebounds, three steals and one block in 26 minutes of action. His impact stretched beyond the stat sheet; his harrowing length and timing deterred Oklahoma City from attacking the rim. All of that is to say that San Antonio's supernova made a marked impact on proceedings from the bench.\n\nMORE: Inside Spurs center Luke Kornet's evolution\n\nHe wasn't alone in anchoring the Spurs' impressive showcase. De'Aaron Fox scored 21 of his 29 points in the first half, finding his rhythm while matched up against the Thunder's best perimeter defenders. Rookie Dylan Harper also showed flashes of brilliance, tallying a loud 12 points that was punctuated by a wondrous two-handed dunk through traffic.\n\nHAVE YOURSELF A MERRY CHRISTMAS, DYLAN HARPER 😤 pic.twitter.com/LtZHTnZlmX\n\n— SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) December 25, 2025\n\nThe Thunder's attack was left sputtering amid an onslaught of Spurs defenders. They hit just 38.9% of their shots and 25% of their threes on Thursday afternoon. Oklahoma City's 102 points is its second-lowest tally this season.\n\nWhat's the reason for San Antonio's success over their rival? It's anyone's guess, really. Wembanyama's defensive gravity keeps even the best attacking players on their toes. The Spurs also have an assortment of ball-handlers capable of fending off OKC's finest defenders. Regardless of the reason for their success, it's clear that there isn't a side better-equipped at handling the Thunder than San Antonio.\n\nWe'll see if they can maintain that level of display against Oklahoma City going forward.\n\nMORE: Which teams could trade for Giannis Antetokounmpo",

Any time you set history it is always interesting to point out.\n\nYou may have missed the “history” as it was not obvious to the naked eye, even if it was technically seen by it. The Cowboys’ history made on Christmas was by way of their uniform combination as they wore (from top to bottom) their white helmets, navy jerseys, and white pants. Basically this was their old school “color rush” uniform with the navy jersey as the middle portion.\n\nThis is a combination that Dallas had never worn as noted. We have seen them use the helmet and pants before or helmet and jersey even, but either the silver helmet or pants were a part of those particular ensembles when they were trotted out before.\n\nRecent history has seen the Cowboys wear their navy uniforms more often and even do so at home which was previously something they never ever did. Consider that they wore navy at home last week in their AT&T Stadium finale.\n\nWe will see what else they come up with in the future.",

Both players succeeded in big ways.\n\nHaulcy led LSU in tackles this past season with 88. He also added three interceptions, four passes broken up, and a forced fumble. He held his own in coverage and was a thumper in the run game. There's nothing else the Tigers could have asked him to do.\n\nThere was a four-week stretch where he finished with at least 12 tackles in each game. It felt like he was involved in every play that went into the box. His best individual game was in the losing effort against the Texas A&M Aggies, when he had 12 tackles with an interception and a pass break up.\n\nThe Texas native is a major college football success story. He came out of high school as a three-star recruit. 247Sports had him ranked as the 150th best safety in that class and the 266th best player in his home state.\n\nHe was viewed with more respect as a transfer, but he still ended up outplaying those expectations. He was the 151st player in the portal and the third-ranked safety. Now, he's going to be one of the first safeties taken in the NFL draft, receiving some second-round evaluations.\n\nHaulcy now becomes the third player from this Tigers team to declare for the draft, joining Delane and Aaron Anderson.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhere to watch Chiefs vs. Broncos\n\nThe NFL on Christmas Day delivers an AFC West rivalry matchup unlike any seen in the last decade, as the Denver Broncos (12-3) travel to Kansas City to take on the Chiefs (6-9) at Arrowhead Stadium.\n\nIn a stunning reversal of roles, the Broncos enter as the dominant force, aiming to secure the AFC West title and remain firmly in the driver's seat for the conference's crucial No. 1 overall seed and the coveted first-round bye. With the Los Angeles Chargers breathing down their necks, a victory over the crippled Chiefs would officially clinch the AFC West for Denver, ending Kansas City's unprecedented nine-year reign as division champions and marking this holiday game as perhaps the most significant in Denver's last ten years.\n\nFor the three-time defending AFC Champion Chiefs, this prime-time holiday slot is a bittersweet stage for an unfamiliar role. Having already been officially eliminated from playoff contention for the first time in the Patrick Mahomes era, the Chiefs have seen their season completely unravel, suffering a losing record for the first time since 2012. The franchise is currently battling devastating injuries, with Mahomes and his backup Gardner Minshew both sidelined by ACL injuries, leaving the offense to be managed by third-string quarterback Chris Oladokun. The team that was once the gatekeeper of the AFC has become a hollow shell of its dynasty self.\n\nThe stark contrast in stakes presents a unique challenge to the streaking Broncos, who must overcome a late-season loss to the Jaguars that snapped their 11-game winning streak. Head Coach Sean Payton is stressing focus, emphasizing that despite the Chiefs' struggles, a division title and the No. 1 seed are still their stated goals. A win in Kansas City, where the Broncos have historically struggled, would not only solidify their resurgence but would also serve as the ceremonial passing of the torch, ushering in a new era of dominance in the AFC West.\n\nThis Christmas night contest marks a seismic shift in the AFC power structure. What was once the annual, late-season coronation of the Chiefs is now the potential crowning moment for the Broncos — a team ready to reclaim the top spot in the AFC West and send a clear message to the rest of the conference.\n\nThe Sporting News is tracking live scoring updates and highlights for Chiefs vs. Broncos on Christmas.

    "fullText": "Over the last couple of months, PSG have been linked to Newcastle United standout Sandro Tonali. Nonetheless, no serious move has materialized so far, but rumors of the Parisians’ interest in the Italian emerge every few months.\n\nAccording to a previous report from Fichajes, PSG could already have their sights set on Tonali as they aim to strengthen their midfield and build on a historic campaign from last season.\n\nMoreover, this update follows a report from TuttoJuve claiming that both Juventus and PSG are preparing bids for Tonali. According to the outlet, the French side remain intent on pursuing the midfielder and are unwilling to step aside, even as Juventus push to land him.\n\nDespite interest from clubs, Newcastle have no interest in selling the midfielder. Nonetheless, there’s only one scenario in which the player could ever leave the Magpies.\n\nTonali is Juventus’ dream signing, as reported by Gazzetta dello Sport, although it would take a transfer request from the 25-year-old and a suitable offer for the Magpies to let him leave.\n\nThe Bianconeri could aim for an initial loan with an obligation to sign permanently, contingent on them qualifying for the Champions League. They could also look to include striker Jonathan David in a deal if Newcastle are open to that possibility.\n\nAmidst reports concerning Tonali’s future, Italian journalist Gianluca Di Marzio shared his assessment of what the player wants to do, but whether that will be the outcome remains to be seen.\n\n“In his heart, Sandro Tonali still dreams of returning to AC Milan,” Di Marzio said. “He left against his will. It was a decision made by the club, and he didn’t feel he could say no when Newcastle’s offer arrived. He doesn’t want to return to Italy, he wants to return to Milan.”",

    "description": "The NFL playoff picture is coming into focus. As the season winds through December and January, we’re highlighting each team that has clinched a spot in the 2025-26 NFL playoffs.",
    "fullText": "The 2026 NFL Playoffs get started on Saturday, January 10 with four teams kicking off the Wild Card round. The playoff field will feature 14 teams with 12 of them playing that first weekend and the No. 1 seed in each conference getting a bye to the Divisional Round. This year, the opening round features two games on Saturday, three games on Sunday, and one game on Monday.\n\nEight teams will face off in the Divisional round, with that weekend featuring two games on Saturday the 17th and two games on Sunday the 18th. The Conference Championship round follows with the final four teams facing off on Sunday the 25th. The final two teams square off in Santa Clara, California at Super Bowl 60 on Sunday, February 8, 2026.\n\nThe field is slowly filling up as teams punch their ticket for the 2026 NFL Playoffs. Below is each team that has clinched a playoff berth.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Green Bay Packers (34-26) to improve to 12-2.\n\nThe Broncos have not won a lot of pretty games this season, but they keep on chugging along. Bo Nix has made plays when they’ve mattered most and the Broncos have emerged as arguably the best team in the AFC. They clinched their playoff berth with a comeback win over the Packers and moved a game up on the Patriots for the No. 1 seed. They remain two games up on the Chargers and can clinch the AFC West title and the No. 1 seed with a win and some help in Week 16.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Detroit Lions (41-34) to improve to 11-3\n\nWeek 16 update: The Rams lost to the Seahawks in overtime on Thursday Night Football to drop to second place in the NFC West, pending the outcome of 49ers-Colts on Monday. LA is now 11-4.\n\nThe Rams are playing as well as anybody right now and are headed back to the playoffs. They fell behind by ten points against Detroit, but a big third quarter got them back and they controlled things in the fourth quarter. They are tied with the Seahawks atop the NFC West, but hold the tiebreaker edge for the time-being due to their first head-to-head win over Seattle back in Week 11. The two squads face off in Week 16 with first place in the division and the No. 1 seed in the NFC on the line.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Seahawks (38-37) to improve to 12-3\n\nThe Seahawks won a wild overtime thriller over the Rams to clinch a playoff berth. More importantly than securing a playoff berth, the Seahawks moved into first place in the NFC West and took over the No. 1 seed in the conference. They’ve won five straight and close out the season one the road against the Panthers and 49ers. The division title will likely go down to the wire in Week 18.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Washington Commanders (29-18) to improve to 10-5.\n\nThe Eagles have struggled in recent weeks after a 4-0 start, but they are headed back to the playoffs. They rolled over the Commanders in the second half to clinch the NFC East title. It was their second straight win after losing three straight to the Cowboys, Bears, and Chargers. They will head into Week 17 sitting a game back of the Bears for the No. 2 seed and two back of the Seahawks for the No. 1 seed.\n\nHow they clinched: Detroit Lions loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers (29-24)\n\nThe 49ers still have to play on Monday Night Football, but they got good news on Sunday with the Lions loss to the Steelers. San Francisco still has a chance at the NFC West title and the No. 1 seed in the conference, but they at least know they are officially headed back to the playoffs. They host the Bears in Week 17 and finish the season against at home against the Seahawks.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Green Bay Packers (22-16) to improve to 11-4, coupled with the Detroit Lions losing to the Pittsburgh Steelers (29-24)\n\nChicago has bigger things in mind, but they at least know they’ll be playing in the postseason. The Bears win the Packers firmed up their lead in the NFC North, and they now have a division-clinching scenario in Week 17. The Bears travel to face the 49ers next week and close out the season at home against the Lions.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Baltimore Ravens (28-24) to improve to 12-3\n\nThe Patriots held off Derrick Henry and the Ravens to punch their ticket to the 2026 NFL Playoffs. They remain a game up on the Bills in the AFC East and can clinch the division title next week with a win and a Bills loss. They also moved into a tie with the Broncos for the No. 1 seed in the AFC. Denver has the tiebreaker heading into Week 17 based on the common games tiebreaker.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Denver Broncos (34-20) coupled with Colts loss to 49ers (48-27)\n\nThe Jaguars are headed back to the playoffs for the first time in three years. They clinched a wild card berth, but will be more focused on the division title. They head into week 17 with an 11-4 record and a one-game lead on the Texans for the division title. They sit in third place in the overall NFC standings and are a game back of the Patriots and Broncos for the top two seeds.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Cleveland Browns (23-20) coupled with Colts loss to 49ers (48-27)\n\nThe Bills punched their ticket, but the division title is still a possibility. The Patriots lost in Week 16, and the Bills win moved them to only a game back in the division. Buffalo is currently the sixth seed and is riding a four-game win streak as they head toward the playoffs.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Dallas Cowboys (34-17) coupled with Colts loss to 49ers (48-27)\n\nThe Chargers are headed back to the playoffs for a second straight season. They are guaranteed a spot, but still have a shot at the AFC West title. The Broncos loss in Week 16 allowed the Chargers to cut the division lead to one game with two weeks remaining. The Chargers and Broncos face off in Denver in Week 18, so if both teams win in Week 17, that game will be for the division title, and maybe the No. 1 seed.\n\nHow they clinched: Detroit Lions loss to the Minnesota Vikings (23-10)\n\nThe Packers had two clinching scenarios, one if they won or tied their game against the Ravens on Saturday of Week 17, and one if the Lions lost or tied their game against the Vikings. Detroit ended up losing and Green Bay punched their ticket. The Packers are effectively two games back of the Bears in the NFC North, but they still have a chance at the division title if they can win out and the Bears lose out.",

    "description": "Week 17 will go down as a win for the Cowboys but there are other numbers that tell the real story of what happened against Washington.",
    "fullText": "The Dallas Cowboys’ Week 17 win over the rival Washington Commanders won’t be remembered for much. Both teams entered the Christmas Day affair firmly eliminated from playoff contention and both teams showed exactly why they are categorized as pretenders rather than contenders.\n\nDespite claiming the 30-23 win, the day rang hollow for Dallas. Not since Clark W. Griswald was enrolled in the Jelly of the Month club has such a disappointing gift been bestowed. The Cowboys moved to 7-8-1 with a chance to avoid a losing season next week, but the game was against a third-string quarterback and took until the final minute to seal the deal. The win was big for the culture but wasn't, by any means, uplifting.\n\nUnlike most weeks, it wasn’t about the final score or the win-loss record. Those numbers pale in comparison to a few other telling numbers. At the end of the day it’s all about 87, 38, and 6. An explanation:\n\n87 offensive plays is a ridiculously high number of plays for an offense to post in an overtime game, let alone a game played entirely in regulation. Compared to the Commanders' 41 plays, it signaled total dominance on the afternoon. Combined with the 152-yard delta in offensive yards gained, it showed Dak Prescott and company were clearly in control. Considering there were zero Cowboys’ turnovers, it’s hard to believe Dallas only won by seven points.\n\nIf this proves anything it’s that it takes more than a dominant offense to safely win in today’s NFL. The Cowboys’ break-but-don’t bend defense (you read that correctly) has given up points in droves this season and far too often rewarded touchdowns on red zone appearances. No yards were wasted for Washington.\n\nThe Cowboys' 87 plays are the third-most in an NFL game this season, per TruMedia.\n\n— Nicki Jhabvala (@NickiJhabvala) December 25, 2025\n\nTime of possession is one of the more overrated stats in the NFL, yet it does shed light on the current state of affairs in Dallas. In this case it speaks to the Cowboys' balance and efficiency on offense. It also exposes their second-half struggles where they only managed six total points which comes on the heels of a Week 16 game where Dallas scored zero points in the second half against the Chargers.\n\nIt's a one-score game with 16 seconds left in the third quarter. Cowboys, 27-20. Cowboys have not scored a second-half touchdown since the fourth quarter of the Detroit game. It's up to 14 possessions without a second half TD (2 vs. Lions, 5 vs Minn, 5 vs. Chargers, 2 vs. Wash)\n\n— Todd Archer (@toddarcher) December 25, 2025\n\nThe Cowboys' offense has proved their worth in efficiency but haven’t been opportunistic enough to turn all those yards into points. With so many plays and so much ball control, one would expect the Cowboys to strike gold more often than they did. Much like Buzz McCallister’s life savings, it was there for the taking, the Cowboys just couldn’t scale the bookshelf well enough to secure the lunchbox.\n\nDak Prescott was under constant assault in Week 17, falling six times for 38 yards to sacks. A case could be made three of the six sacks are on Prescott himself, but the situation highlights the pass protection limits this offense has had in 2025.\n\nThe need to fix the pass protection on the offensive line is real and has to be a priority this coming offseason.\n\nYou can follow Reid on X @ReidDHanson and be sure to follow Cowboys Wire on Facebook to join in on the conversation with fellow fans!\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cowboys Wire: By The Numbers: Cowboys win 30-23, but 87, 38 and 6 tell the story",

Doncic suffered a calf injury on Christmas and was traded in February.\n\nWith Doncic gone, Mavericks fans hoped this holiday season would be different.\n\nMavericks wing Naji Marshall threw a lead pass downcourt to Anthony Davis, but the center slowed before securing the ball. Davis was experiencing muscle spasms in his right groin.\n\nDavis immediately limped to the bench and later went to the locker room after being evaluated. He was ruled out after halftime. Davis missed six weeks last season with a left adductor strain.\n\nWith Davis exiting with right muscle spasms remaining in the second quarter, Dallas fell 126-116 to the Golden State Warriors on Thursday at Chase Center.",

    "description": "The Lions face the Vikings in Minneapolis on Christmas Day. We break down what the game means for the NFL playoff picture in Week 17.",
    "fullText": "Game result: The Lions are officially done for the season. They have one more game, but they will not be headed to the playoffs. They committed six turnovers, including five by quarterback Jared Goff in a 23-10 loss to the Vikings. The Lions defense kept the team in it, holding the Vikings to only two touchdowns in spite of all the turnovers, but Detroit’s offense could get nothing done.\n\nThe Lions loss also helped the Packers punch their playoff ticket. Green Bay could have clinched their own spot with a win on Saturday over the Ravens, but now they head into that game looking to gain ground on the Bears in the NFC North.\n\nThe Detroit Lions sit on the verge of playoff elimination and need help the final two weeks of the 2025-26 NFL regular season. They can help themselves to start when they face the Minnesota Vikings on Christmas Day. The game kicks off at 4:30 p.m. ET and Detroit is a 5.5-point road favorite.\n\nThis is the second matchup of the season between these two teams. The Vikings won 27-24 in the first game in Detroit. J.J. McCarthy made his return from a high ankle sprain to throw for two touchdowns. The team added 142 rushing yards and held the Lions ground game to just 65 in the win. McCarthy will not play in this game due to a fracture in his throwing hand. Max Brosmer will get the start in his place.\n\nThe Lions had a chance to climb back into the mix last week, but a loss to the Steelers cost them. They have no control over their destiny and could be eliminated regardless of their outcome this week. The Lions are eliminated from playoff contention with a loss to the Vikings or if the Packers win or tie against the Ravens on Saturday. Green Bay is a 2.5-point favorite at home in that game.\n\nEven if the Lions win and the Packers lose, they would still need to win in Week 18 at the Bears and have the Packers lose on the road to the Vikings. It’s possible this could happen, but the odds are not great.\n\nUsing The Athletic playoff simulator, the Lions currently have a 4% chance of making the playoffs. If they beat the Vikings and the Packers lose to the Ravens, their chances increase to 14%.\n\nTiebreakers don’t matter in this situation due to the Packers having a tie on their record. Green Bay has the head-to-head tiebreaker over Detroit, but if the Lions tie the Vikings or Bears to close they season, they are eliminated from playoff contention.",

    "description": "There’s never been just one way to buy software. In ye olden times, if you liked some shareware, you’d mail off a cheque, or call up a hot-line, to get the full version. Later on, you could walk into a store and walk out with a shiny box, manuals, and disks.",
    "fullText": "There’s never been just one way to buy software. In ye olden times, if you liked some shareware, you’d mail off a cheque, or call up a hot-line, to get the full version. Later on, you could walk into a store and walk out with a shiny box, manuals, and disks.\n\nThese were some expensive boxes:\n\nNo one technically had to upgrade, but in a year or so, everybody did, because we wanted those sweet quality-of-life improvements, nicer design, and exciting new features. But eventually every product being continually developed will become good enough for its target market.\n\nWhen that happens, companies (especially the VC-backed kind) now need to contrive new and increasingly stick-like reasons for customers to pay again. From made-for-marketing ‘features’ that suck to use IRL, to breaking compatibility with older versions, to spamming you with marketing notifications and embedded ads. Their relationship with customers goes from symbiotic to parasitic.\n\nOn the other hand, the pursuit of completeness should be an ideal fit for subscription software because, theoretically, steady monthly payments from long-time customers incentivizes stability, polish, and helpful improvements.\n\nSubscriptions are particularly helpful for businesses:\n\nEspecially for solo creators, just knowing that you have ~$3000/mo coming in every month is way less anxiety-inducing than making $6,000 in a good month – but knowing that next month you could just as likely make $1000, or maybe even $0. It’s like being a farmer, surviving at the mercy of good weather.\n\nThere’s also a third reason: Tier or usage-based pricing prevents customers costing more money than they contribute. But unless you’re burning unlimited money generating LLM tokens, the risk of losing money on a web app customer is either basically zero, or very easy to predict otherwise (even over the long-term).\n\nOn paper, subscriptions could be a win-win. But some people, including many readers of this blog, have good reasons to be wary of them.\n\nKinopio subscriptions can be easily cancelled, pricing is grandfathered, receipts are emailed, accidental renewals can be refunded, and there are no cancellation fees or deceptive dark patterns. Many indie subscription apps also offer subscriptions in good faith.\n\nBut a business model that’s regularly exploited by well-known corporations, like the New York Times and Adobe, poisons the well for everyone else. Every time someone gets tricked into signing up for a non-refundable yearly subscription instead of a monthly one, or has to call to cancel a subscription they created online, those bad feelings become associated with all subscriptions.\n\nIt’s hard to have good long-lasting relationships with customers if they’re expecting the worst.\n\nThat being said, I still think subscriptions make sense to offer.\n\nFor most people, subscriptions are as normal as the old boxed software model used to be. And the much lower-cost to entry can be very helpful – especially in competitive markets where customers have a lot of options.\n\nThe onus is on companies selling subscriptions to earn trust by being transparent about who they are, what they believe, and how they’re funded (i.e. what their long-term incentives are). A public roadmap and changelog also go a long-way towards proving they practice what they preach.\n\nEven to non-technical people, paying for subscriptions makes intuitive sense when the product requires a server for helpful things like file uploads, public URLs, and real-time collaboration. But the per-user-cost of running a production CRUD server is basically zero. Counter-intuitively, what you’re really paying for is the considerable effort and expertise that it takes to keep full-featured software running reliably and continuously-improving.\n\nThat’s part of the reason why I increased prices over the years as the app grew in capability and complexity.\n\nFor context, here’s Kinopio’s pricing history:\n\nWhen I introduced paid upgrades to Kinopio in 2020, I did it as a monthly subscription because that seemed like the safe, default model for an app that needed a server.\n\nIn all my previous jobs, there was always a dedicated back-end or sysadmin team that abstracted the server hosting details from the rest of the company. They used complicated sounding terms like load balancing, replica shards, containers, observability, were woken up by pagerDuty, and were eternally worried about scaling.\n\nBut when I dived into that world, I learned that most of the jargon really didn’t matter. The kinopio-server is a simple node.js app with a pretty straightforward MVC architecture. My insecurity about keeping servers up is a big reason behind why the app works offline, or if the server is down. What developers would call local-first today.\n\nIn 2019, I wrote about my early Plans for Kinopio. Where I mentioned that,\n\n“Kinopio consists of two codebases, the client-app that runs when in the browser and the server-app which enables sharing and collaboration. The client is like a cockroach, its tiny, basically free to host, and doesn’t depend on a connection to the server. So if I can’t afford to run the Kinopio server anymore, I can just switch it off and you can continue to use Kinopio as you do now – with all your data intact.”\n\nTwo years later, I introduced the lifetime plan mainly because people kept asking me for a subscription alternative. I’m sure many of them would have still have paid for a subscription, but how long would a rueful customer stay? Would they always be looking for alternatives? Would they still enthusiastically share spaces and recommend the app to their friends and teams?\n\nMy business ‘strategy’ is that a happy customer is better than an unhappy one, and that I’d rather have some money from a user than none. (Relatedly, that’s also why Kinopio offers student/financial needs discounts).\n\nThe lifetime plan is priced at ~3× the yearly price because that was the average churn length at the time. But I think that in general, 3-4 years is a good starting point if you get a nice sounding number that is high enough so that only <10% of new customers choose it, while stilling feeling anchored to the subscription prices.\n\nSoftware designers and engineers regularly build products with original ideas, and choose to make their own jobs harder by increasing code complexity, so that their users can have an inviting, easier-to-use, and lower-friction, time using it.\n\nBut on the financial-side, web-based software companies tend to be really conservative with their business models and choose subscription-only models by default. It’s never even questioned, but I think it should be. Just like with dev work, pricing models can also take on behind-the-scenes complexity to give users a better experience.\n\nLow-variability/high-tail income (subscription MRR) is easiest to plan for, but high-variability/short-tail income (lifetime purchases) is peaky and harder to plan for – but they can work together. If you position and price it right, the ideal customers for lifetime pricing will be very different than the ideal subscription customers.\n\nIt may sound counter-intuitive to give your most passionate users a pathway to never have to pay you again, but especially early on, evangelism is worth more than money. There are plenty of fish in the sea: people who have yet to find, or be recommended, Kinopio and become future customers.",

    "description": "MIT researchers developed a method that converts a user’s design into a flat series of interconnected tiles that can be converted to a 3D structure with one pull of a single string.",
    "fullText": "MIT researchers have developed a new method for designing 3D structures that can be transformed from a flat configuration into their curved, fully formed shape with only a single pull of a string.\n\nThis technique could enable the rapid deployment of a temporary field hospital at the site of a disaster such as a devastating tsunami — a situation where quick medical action is essential to save lives.\n\nThe researchers’ approach converts a user-specified 3D structure into a flat shape composed of interconnected tiles. The algorithm uses a two-step method to find the path with minimal friction for a string that can be tightened to smoothly actuate the structure.\n\nThe actuation mechanism is easily reversible, and if the string is released, the structure quickly returns to its flat configuration. This could enable complex, 3D structures to be stored and transported more efficiently and with less cost.\n\nIn addition, the designs generated by their system are agnostic to the fabrication method, so complete structures can be produced using 3D printing, CNC milling, molding, or other techniques.\n\nThis method could enable the creation of transportable medical devices, foldable robots that can flatten to enter hard-to-reach spaces, or even modular space habitats that can be actuated by robots working on the surface of Mars.\n\n“The simplicity of the whole actuation mechanism is a real benefit of our approach. The user just needs to provide their intended design, and then our method optimizes it in such a way that it holds the shape after just one pull on the string, so the structure can be deployed very easily. I hope people will be able to use this method to create a wide variety of different, deployable structures,” says Akib Zaman, an electrical engineering and computer science (EECS) graduate student and lead author of a paper on this new method.\n\nHe is joined on the paper by MIT graduate student Jacqueline Aslarus; postdoc Jiaji Li; Associate Professor Stefanie Mueller, leader of the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Engineering Group in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL); and senior author Mina Konaković Luković, an assistant professor and leader of the Algorithmic Design Group in CSAIL. The research was presented at the Association for Computing Machinery’s SIGGRAPH Conference and Exhibition on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques in Asia.\n\nFrom ancient art to an algorithm\n\nCreating deployable structures from flat pieces simplifies on-site assembly and could be especially useful in constructing emergency shelters after natural disasters. On a smaller scale, items like foldable bike helmets could improve the safety of riders who would otherwise be unable to carry a bulky helmet.\n\nBut converting flat, deployable objects into their 3D shape often requires specialized equipment or multiple steps, and the actuation mechanism is typically difficult to reverse.\n\n“Because of these challenges, deployable structures tend to be manually designed and quite simple, geometrically. But if we can create more complex geometries, while simplifying the actuation mechanism, we could enhance the capabilities of these deployables,” Zaman says.\n\nTo do this, the researchers created a method that automatically converts a user’s 3D design into a flat structure comprised of tiles, connected by rotating hinges at the corners, which can be fully actuated by pulling a single string one time.\n\nTheir method breaks a user design into a grid of quadrilateral tiles inspired by kirigami, the ancient Japanese art of paper cutting. With kirigami, by cutting a material in certain ways, they can encode it with unique properties. In this case, they use kirigami to create an auxetic mechanism, which is a structure that gets thicker when stretched and thinner when compressed.\n\nAfter encoding the 3D geometry into a flat set of auxetic tiles, the algorithm computes the minimum number of points that the tightening string must lift to fully deploy the 3D structure. Then, it finds the shortest path that connects those lift points, while including all areas of the object’s boundary that must be connected to guide the structure into its 3D configuration. It does these calculations in such a way that the optimal string path minimizes friction, enabling the structure to be smoothly actuated with just one pull.\n\n“Our method makes it easy for the user. All they have to do is input their design, and our algorithm automatically takes care of the rest. Then all the user needs to do is to fabricate the tiles exactly the way it has been computed by the algorithm,” Zaman says.\n\nFor instance, one could fabricate a structure using a multi-material 3D printer that prints the hinges of the tiles with a flexible material and the other surfaces with a hard material.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges the researchers faced was figuring out how the string route and the friction within the string channel can be effectively modeled as close to physical reality.\n\n“While playing with a few fabricated models, we observed that closing boundary tiles is a must to enable a successful deployment and the string must be routed through them. Later, we proved this observation mathematically. Then, we looked back at an age-old physics equation and used it to formulate the optimization problem for friction minimization,” he says.\n\nThey built their automatic algorithm into an interactive user interface that allows one to design and optimize configurations to generate manufacturable objects.\n\nThe researchers used their method to design several objects of different sizes, from personalized medical items including a splint and a posture corrector to an igloo-like portable structure. They also fabricated a deployable, human-scale chair they designed using their method.\n\nThis method is scale independent, so it could be used to create tiny deployable objects that are injected and actuated inside the body, or architectural structures, like the frame of a building, that are deployed and actuated on-site using cranes.\n\nIn the future, the researchers want to further explore the design of tiny structures, while also tackling the engineering challenges involved in creating architectural installations, such as determining the ideal cable thickness and the necessary strength of the hinges. In addition, they want to create a self-deploying mechanism, so the structures do not need to be actuated by a human or robot.\n\nThis research is funded, in part, by an MIT Research Support Committee Award.",

    "fullText": "on December 23, 2025\n\nI wrote\r\n last month about my diabetes diagnosis this year and my\r\n difficult choice to wear a proprietary device (called a\r\n CGM) on my arm 24/7\r\n to continuously monitor my glucose levels. Like my friend and colleague,\r\n Karen M. Sandler — who previously made a much higher-stakes choice to\r\n receive a proprietary implanted defibrillator to keep her safe given her\r\n genetic heart condition — I reluctantly chose to attach proprietary\r\n hardware and software to my body.\n\nThe device itself is quite proprietary, but fortunately\r\n the FOSS\r\n community has reverse engineered its activation and data collection\r\n protocols — creating an Android application that does a better job\r\n than the manufacturers' proprietary ones0.\n\nHere in the USA, we strangely use capitalism as the center of our health care system. Two major for-profit competing brands of CGM are\r\n available here. My diabetes specialist prefers the (ironically named)\r\n Freestyle Libre Plus from Abbott. I (also rather strangely) bring a prescription\r\n for electronics to a pharmacy every month. On 2025-12-03, that phramacy sent me an alarming text message (shown here).\n\nAfter reading that text, I\r\n found the\r\n USA FDA announcement. My spouse cross-referenced the lot numbers while I read them off from all my Freestyle boxes1. I had indeed recently worn an\r\nimpacted device!\n\nOnly because my diabetes is so early of a stage was I relatively safe. The FDA\r\n reports that Freestyle injured over 700 people and killed seven\r\n people with this bug. Spcifically, the bug caused the device to falsely report an\r\n extremely low glucose level. Advanced stage diabetics use low\r\n reading information to inform them that they may have too much insulin\r\n currently. The usual remedy is to eat something sugary to raise glucose in the blood. \r\n Such should be done only with great care, as a false low reading can harm and even kill the patient (who eats a high-sugar-content item while glucose in the blood is, in fact, not low).\n\nProprietary software in medical devices harming patients is not new. In\r\n 1985,\r\n the Therac-25\r\n killed three people. In 2020, hundreds of patients who relied on a financially troubled tech startup found their occular implants suddenly unsupported. Some patients went blind as the devices powered down without updates. There are more examples that I could include here, but rereading this horrific stories is frankly more than I can take right now when I think of fellow diabetes sufferers who were “killed by code” recently..\n\nIt's hubris for activists to guarantee that harm would be prevented if Freestyle had publicly released the\r\n hardware specifications and the complete, corresponding source code\r\n (CCS).\r\n FOSS isn't immune to bugs —\r\n even dangerous ones. However, in the centuries since the Enlightenment, we\r\n know that the scientific method depends on public disclosure about\r\n data and wide-reaching peer review of past work. FOSS (plus a publicly disclosed\r\n hardware design) wouid allow the millions of hardware and software engineers to\r\n peer-review the integrity, security, and safety of the devices to which\r\n patients entrust their lives. We achieve the promise of humanity when we\r\n each entrust our safety and health to our entire community — not\r\n merely a single for-profit entity.\n\nWe also will probably never know whether this issue was in hardware or\r\n software. The bug disclosure is incredibly vague, and it remains unclear\r\n how much investigation was done (if any) by government regulators into this\r\n problem. As a public policy and public health matter, the\r\n public deserves to know the technical details (software and\r\n hardware) of both the functioning device and the failed devices. NGOs should be permitted to perform\r\n their own investigations and confirmations of public safety.\n\nGiven that the hardware, software, and medical for-profit industries\r\nrefuse to put the rights, safety and security of patients first, wrongful\r\ndeath lawsuits are typically the only way to hold these companies\r\n accountable. Yet, there are very few people who have not agreed\r\nAbbott's toxic terms of their\r\n proprietary companion application — I guestimate \r\nthat fewer than 1% of\r\n Freestyle-using patients have used Juggluco from their very start (and\r\n thus never agreed to Abbott's terms). This is significant because Abbott includes a\r\n comprehensive one-way indemnity for themselves in the terms. I hope that a\r\n class action suit begins soon on this matter, but I wonder and worry that\r\n so much of the class may have signed this indemnity (which may make the road to justice\r\n bumpier).\n\nFinally, I want to offer that if there is anyone out there who does\r\n tear-downs of extremely tiny electronic devices, I would be thrilled to\r\n find a volunteer who would like to see if we can either extract any\r\n software components from the device, or reverse-engineer the hardware. I\r\n have saved and sanitized all of my prior CGMs.\r\n I'd gladly send one along\r\n to anyone who wants to give a try at taking them apart. (Contact SFC or contact me on the Fediverse (via Mastodon) if you're available to do this work.)\n\nFor my part, I look forward (after the Vizio trial) to\r\n sending some patches to\r\n Juggluco and also getting Juggluco available in F-Droid. Our best option in the face of\r\n these powerful medical device companies curtailing our rights is to invest\r\n our volunteer time into the edges where\r\n FOSS has\r\n resiliently worked around the constant roadblocks erected by bad\r\n actors.\n\n0My prior post about CGMs discussed the GPLv3'd Juggluco in more detail.\n\n1 In a fascinating turn of events, at least one of my past monitors (of which I fortitously saved all the boxes with the lot/serial number on them) is listed in the FDA's spreadsheet as recalled lot, yet the serial number is listed as “ safe to use” on Abbott's webform 🤔 … I'm left wondering how I can trust Abbott to write reliable software stuck into my arm if they can't even write a web form that cross-references serial numbers to lots correctly 😬.",

    "fullText": "OpenAI is in talks to raise up to $100 billion in a funding round that could value the ChatGPT maker at up to $830 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, citing anonymous sources.\n\nThe company is aiming to raise the funding by the end of the calendar first quarter next year, and it may ask sovereign wealth funds to invest in the round, the WSJ reported. The Information first reported news of the deal, though it said the fundraise would land OpenAI a $750 billion price tag.\n\nThe funding would come as OpenAI commits to spend trillions of dollars and strikes deals around the world as the company tries to stay ahead in the race to develop AI technology. The cash injection would also help the company with its spending on inferencing, which seems to be funded more by cash than cloud credits, suggesting the company’s compute costs have grown beyond what partnerships and credits can subsidize.\n\nAnd, as competition intensifies from rivals like Anthropic and Google, OpenAI has had to step on the gas to release new models and expand its presence in the developer and tooling ecosystem.\n\nMeanwhile, broader sentiment around AI has recently cooled as investors start doubting whether the pace of debt-fueled investment by giants like Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle, and OpenAI itself can be maintained in the long run. It also doesn’t help that the production of chips is being constrained by shortages in the supply of memory chips, which threatens to affect the broader tech sector.\n\nOpenAI has also been rumored to be working on an IPO as a way to raise tens of billions and fund its development efforts, which are currently said to be generating annual run-rate revenue of about $20 billion. There are also rumors that the company is courting Amazon for a $10 billion investment that would also give the AI lab access to the tech giant’s new AI computing chips.\n\nIf the fundraise happens, it would add a substantial amount to OpenAI’s coffers, which currently have more than $64 billion, according to PitchBook data. The company was most recently valued at about $500 billion in a secondary transaction.\n\nOpenAI did not immediately return a request for comment.",

    "fullText": "I use my line scan camera to take cool pictures of trains and other stuff.\n\nBut there’s a lot that goes into properly processing the images.\n\nThe way it works is that the camera has a single column of pixels (or in this case, two columns), that scans at a super high speed.\nThe camaera is stationary, but as a train moves past it, it gets scanned.\n\nThis is essentially also how a photo finish camera works.\n\nSince the background is static, it gets repeated for every column of the image, giving it its distinctive striped look.\n\nLine scan cameras are very suitable for capturing trains, since I can capture the full length of the train with minimal perspective distortion.\nThis is super nice for train nerds who want to make models of the trains.\nAlso, as you keep the camera running, you can get incredibly high resolution photos that span over 100,000 pixels wide.\n\nThis is because film is less sensitive than modern digital image sensors.\nHowever, you’ll need to know the approximate speed of the subject and pull the film across at roughly the right speed.\n\nI’m using an Alkeria Necta N4K2-7C.\nIt has a 4096×2 Bayer array image sensor.\nI’m saving its raw data in 16 bit binary arrays.\n\nSometimes, I keep the line scan camera running for a while, and it generates tons of boring data of the background.\nTo detect moving things, I compute an “energy function” that’s defined as\n\nwhere maxI\\text{max}_\\mathbf{I} is the maximum pixel value of the image, and the partial derivative are the image gradient.\n\nThis is because, for a static background, it will be full of horizontal stripes.\n\nHowever, doing this by itself risks noisy gradients in empty (but noisy) areas where the gradient direction is completely random.\nThe maximum pixel value term ensures that whatever gradient we see is salient.\n\nThe image is divided into chunks and the score of a chunk is the 99th percentile energy.\n\nFinally, chunks containing moving objects are defined to be ones where the score is at least 1.5× that of the minimum score.\n\nThis heuristic took me longer than I would like to admit to figure out.\nPreviously, I came up with heuristics that worked well on one capture but couldn’t generalize well to other captures.\nSometimes, the background will contain slowly moving foliage waving in the wind, that would screw up other methods of detection.\nThat resulted in a lot of wasted time because time spent processing empty regions seriously slows down iteration speed when developing the later steps.\n\nThe most common question I get is, how do I estimate the speed of the subject?\nIf I don’t do it properly, it will appear stretched out, squished, or flipped.\n\nTypically, I just set the camera to scan as fast as possible while maintaining a decent exposure, so the scan rate is independent of the subject.\nFaster subjects will appear squished, and slower subjects will appear stretched out.\n\nFor most of my earlier works, I just eyeballed it. A good rule of thumb is to look for round things such as the wheels and “no smoking” signs.\nBut now I have a fully automated technique that works fairly robustly.\n\nThe key idea is to exploit the fact that the line scan camera actually has two lines in a Bayer array, where one line is red, green, red, green, and the second line is green, blue, green blue.\n\nThe problem is that the data is very noisy, and salient features are sparse.\nHere’s the general approach:\n\nAs you can see, the data is noisy, but we have surprisingly decent granularity for this very subpixel case where we were scanning slower than needed so the spacing is like 0.5.\n\nThe value of the spline is actually the sample spacing. It tells us how close together or far apart the sample points in the original time series we should be using.\nThis leads us to the next section.\n\nHmm, I think my speed estimation still isn’t perfect. It could be off by about 10%.\nFor future work, I think I might be able to extract features correspondences such as SIFT or LightGlue. Trains are full of repeating elements that are supposed to be evenly spaced. I can detect those, and add a cost function to evenly space them, and optimize.\nAnother idea is to use a circle Hough transform to find circles.\n\nFrom the spline that gives us the sample spacing, we can basically generate the samples as such:\n\nHowever, there are a few gotchas:\n\nNow, for each sample position, we also store the sample width, which is the value of the spline.\nIf we were to simply extract a single column from the raw data, we would be throwing away a lot of data, and the result wouldn’t be antialiased.\nInstead, it is better to pick a window of width proportional to the sample spacing.\nI chose a Hann window.\n\nNot only is the first image very grainy, but the rapidly blinking LED display showing the characters for 筲箕灣 is completely illegible without proper sampling.\n\nAs you can see, the rectangular window performs very poorly when upsampling and introduces horrible jagged artifacts. The Hann window does better. Some other windows like the Sinc are even better supposedly.\n\nRecall that the camera has two lines forming a Bayer array.\n\nIf we simply create an image of half resolution (i.e. 2048 pixels tall instead of 4096), by grouping each RGGB group into one pixel, we would have some nasty fringing problems since the red and blue pixels are offset.\n\nInstead we should write out the image with careful attention to offsets, interpolating as necessary.\nNote that the horizontal offsets must be done after speed estimation, because, before speed estimation, the xx-axis is time, and after speed estimation, the xx-axis is space.\nBut the 2-pixel wide Bayer array is physically a spatial offset.\n\nI implemented a basic interpolation scheme that uses bilinear interpolation.\nThis fixes most of the fringing, although we can do even better. That will be left for future work.\n\nUnlike a traditional Bayer array, here we have the possibility that the green channels cover 100% of the pixels, so we can potentially do better than traditional demosaicing algorithms.\nBut there’s currently an annoying problem, which is that the two green channels on my line scan camera don’t match.\n\nVertical stripes in the image are common and are due to two main reasons:\n\nTo fix this, I use linear regression to fit a basic model of the form:\n\nwhere aa, bb, and cc are scalar parameters of the model, x\\mathbf{x} is a 2048-element vector containing the luminance value of the column (mean over the 4 channels), and k\\mathbf{k} is the row index (aka the 2048-element vector of [0,1,⋯ ,2047]\\begin{bmatrix}0, 1, \\cdots, 2047\\end{bmatrix}.\n\nYou can compose models as such:\n\nThis gives us a new model model12\\text{model}_{12} with parameters:\n\nThe associative property of the composition operator is left as an exercise for the reader.\n\nThere is also the identity model, i.e. one that does nothing, which is\n\nso the set of these models forms a mathematical group.\n\nI fit a model to each consecutive pair of columns using weighted least squares, where we assign each row element a weight based on a Gaussian.\nThe weight would be:\n\nIn other words, the residual would be\n\nAfter fitting this model, we redo the steps again several times, where the w\\mathbf{w} vector is recalculated each time.\nThis is known as iteratively-reweighted least squares and is pretty good at rejecting outliers.\n\nThis all gives us relative models between the previous column and the current column, but we want global models that tell us how to correct each column overall.\nWe could set the global models by just composing them forever, but they would soon start to drift arbitrarily far away from the identity model.\n\nYou could prevent them from drifting away by solving a band-diagonal linear system where you have residuals of two types:\n\nThis can be solved in O(n)O(n). However, it is a bit of work to implement. In practice, you can mitigate most high frequency stripes by just doing exponential smoothing, which basically acts as a high-pass filter\n\nfor some small λ\\lambda, in this case hardcoded to be 0.02.\n\nPreviously, I also had some success by directly fitting the model to line up each column with the first column. However, it doesn’t work for captures where the background isn’t static (e.g. rotating line scan panoramas, and pointing the line scan camera out of a moving train).\n\nIf a train were speeding up, it would appear stretched out at first, and squished at the end, and the striping would affect the end a lot more than the start.\n\nI implemented a patch-based denoiser, also known as block matching.\nIt works by making the observation that you often have repeated textures in a line scan photo of a train.\nTechnically, you also have lots of self-similarity in general photos, so patch-based denoising is a common method for denoising in general.\nHowever, one important distinction is that most denoisers only look in a small neighborhood around the current patch, but mine looks along the entire row.\n\nWhat I do is, for each row, we process it independently.\nFrom each 3×3 pixel patch, we can construct a feature vector of size 27 (9 times 3 channels, RGB).\nThen, we collect all these features and sort them by mean value.\nNow, for each position along the row, we search in the window of size 128 in the sorted vector.\nThe sorted vector will have similar-looking patches nearby, but we further weigh them by Gaussian similarity to the current patch.\nThen, we compute the weighted average of the center pixel of each of those patches.\n\nAnother trick is to realize that the noise is Poisson-distributed which has a standard deviation that scales with the square root of the signal.\nBut if I just square root the input data first, then we just need to compare it to a constant.\n\nThis works decently, but is incredibly slow.\nLet me know if you think of any faster ways to do it. A KD tree in feature space would die from the curse of dimensionality. Perhaps a hash table? To keep things lightweight, we can limit the population in each cell.\n\nThe good thing about the patch-based denoiser is that unique features like this passenger remain virtually unchanged.\n\nPreviously, I also tried using a total variation denoiser, processing each row and column independently.\nIt worked decently but would often destroy fine detail in textures.\n\nIf the camera isn’t perfectly upright, the resulting image may be slightly skewed.\nI’m planning on implementing automatic skew correction.\nBut here are two caveats:\n\nSo basically we’d need to generate a quick, poorly sampled version, run skew detection on it, and then sample it properly afterwards.\nWe can implement skew detection using a Hough transform.\nGenerally, I do a decent job of keeping the camera upright, so we just need to correct for very small skews, so a Hough transform is suitable (since the complexity scales with the number of bins of the histogram).\nWe can also use the energy function from the region of interest detector to primarily care about vertical structures.\n\nI kinda just eyeballed this color calibration matrix.\n\nBut to be honest it looks fairly decent.\n\nThe code is implemented in Python using numpy.\n\nDue to the large size of the data (4096 rows and hundreds of thousands of columns), it is sometimes impossible to fit all of it in memory, so the code takes several passes and outputs in chunks.\nActually, it is probably okay to fit it in a few gigabytes of RAM, but you’d have to chunk up the storage (there’s no way a contiguous numpy array of 4096 by 100,000 could be allocated).\n\nI tried using AI to help with a lot of the implementation. However, the results were mixed.\n\nAI would often accidentally make things quadratic for no reason when a linear time algorithm would suffice. For example, when trying to implement spline-based resampling, ChatGPT 5 came up with horribly slow (but vectorized) code that constructed a giant tensor with a mask across the entire width of the image for every single sample. Since there are 100,000 samples, and each mask was 100,000 columns wide, you can imagine it would take millennia to run. I ended up reimplementing it from scratch by hand. Then Grok 4 implemented weighted least squares regression by materializing the entire weight vector with np.diag instead of simply pre-multiplying each row of A and x with the square root of the weight before doing np.linalg.solve(A, x). Again, with 100,000 elements, making the square matrix with np.diag would have instantly run out of memory.\n\nBoth Grok 4 Expert and ChatGPT 5 Thinking also completely failed to implement the band-diagonal least squares to my vertical stripes strategy, but as mentioned, the exponential smoothing trick works okay for now.\n\nHowever, for some other stuff, AI was quite helpful.\nIt created a class that dynamically loads chunks from disk but provides the API to index and slice it.\nThat was neat.\nAI was also incredibly good at helping with Matplotlib’s arcane syntax.\n\nAdam Magyar uses a black and white digital line scan camera for his “Stainless” project, and another derived from a scanner for his “Urban Flow” project.\n\nHis camera must have much better sensitivity than mine since he managed to capture fairly clean images even for underground trains (whereas I generally require sunlight for mine).\nApparently, he had to scout out many subway stations to find ones where the lights don’t flicker at 60 Hz.\n\nAt kr64.seesaa.net you can find a mind boggling collection of high quality line scan photos of trains from all across Japan.\n\nThey probably do this full time as the variety of trains is far greater than I can ever hope to achieve.\nI believe they use a film slit scan camera.\n\nUnfortunately, their website has a bunch of technical issues and often goes down. I would be happy to help them out but my Japanese is very poor and I don’t see any way to contact them.",

    "description": "A look at the surprising probabilities behind a simple coin flipping game",
    "fullText": "Three heads are certainly more fun\n\nYou’re playing a game with your lying friends Alice and Bob.\n\nBob flips a coin and shows it to Alice. Alice tells you what she saw - but she lies 20% of the time. Then you take your best guess on whether the coin is heads or tails.\n\nYour best strategy is to trust whatever Alice says. You’re right 80% of the time.\n\nNow Bob joins in. He makes up his mind independent of Alice, and he also lies 20% of the time 1.\n\nYou were right 80% of the time by trusting Alice.\n\nHow much better can you do with Bob’s help?\n\nI’m going to give you the answer below. So here’s some empty space for you to think in case you want to do the math yourself.\n\nThe answer is 0% - you don’t do any better! You’re still exactly 80% to get the right answer.\n\nTo establish this, let’s write a simple simulation. We’ll flip a coin a million times, ask our friends what they saw, and observe the results.\n\nFor our strategy, we’ll look at a fact pattern (like “Alice says heads”), figure out what’s most likely (“the coin is heads”), and say “we guess the coin flip correctly whenever the most likely outcome occurs for this fact pattern” 2.\n\n“Guess the most likely outcome” is optimal here, but it is very much not\noptimal if this game was adversarial. It’s important that Alice and Bob aren’t\ntrying to trick us and that they’re deciding independently.\n\nHere’s the code for that simulation. We’ll start with the easy case (just Alice):\n\nNow let’s add Bob to the simulation. We see something like this:\n\nThat’s weird! But perhaps this gives you an intuition for what’s happening. By introducing a second player, we introduce the possibility of a tie.\n\nA decent amount of the time, Alice and Bob agree. Most (~94%) of the time when that happens, they’re telling the truth. Occasionally they’re both lying, but that’s pretty unlikely.\n\nBut a meaningful portion of the time (32%) Alice says heads and Bob says tails, or vice versa. And in that case we don’t know anything at all! Alice and Bob are equally trustworthy and they disagreed - we’d be better off if we’d just gone and asked Alice 3!\n\nI am deeply curious whether anyone else was read the book “Go Ask Alice” by\ntheir middle school science teacher in order to scare them straight or whether\nthat was specific to my middle school experience.\n\nNow that we’ve simulated this result, let’s walk through each case assuming that the coin landed on heads.\n\nThere’s something beautiful here. Our total chance to guess remains at 80% because our additional chance to guess correctly when Alice and Bob agree is perfectly offset by the chance that Alice and Bob disagree!\n\nIf our friend Charlie - who also lies 20% of the time - joins the fun, our odds improve substantially. If Bob and Alice disagree, Charlie can act as a tiebreaker.\n\nBut if David joins, the pattern repeats. David introduces the possibility of a 2-2 split, and our odds don’t improve at all!\n\nAnd this continues, on and on, forever (as long as we have enough friends). If our number N of friends is odd, our chances of guessing correctly don’t improve when we move to N+1 friends.\n\nAs far as I can tell, there’s no name for this weird little phenomenon. But it does appear, implicitly, in voting literature.\n\nCondorcet’s jury theorem is a famous theorem in political science. It states:\n\nSounds a fair bit like our coin flipping problem. Here’s a simplifying assumption that Wikipedia makes when proving the theorem:\n\nHah! The proof explicitly recognizes (and dodges) the even-voter case precisely because that voter doesn’t add any information.\n\nI stumbled upon this result while writing a simulation for a more complex problem. I was so surprised at the simulation results that I assumed that I had a bug in my code. And when I walked through the math by hand I was absolutely delighted.\n\nI suspect some of the surprise for me was because I typically encounter problems like these in the context of betting, not voting. If we’re betting on coin flips, we’re certainly excited to bet more if Alice and Bob agree than if we’re just listening to Alice.\n\nBut voting is a different beast; our outcome is binary. There’s no way to harvest the additional EV from the increased confidence Bob sometimes gives us.\n\nAnyway. I hope this delights you like it did me.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk is resorting to one of the oldest tricks in the book, robbing Peter to pay Paul, to boost demand for Cybertrucks.\n\nElectrek reported on how Musk is using one of his companies, SpaceX, to help make up for a massive shortfall of a market for the controversial Cybertruck.\n\nTesla is facing challenges selling even 20,000 Cybertrucks annually, far below Musk's initial projections of 500,000, per Electrek's analysis. As a result, Tesla is left with large stockpiles of the vehicles even as they've heavily reduced their production.\n\nMaking a small dent in the inventory is SpaceX. The company has already bought over 1,000 Cybertrucks with room to double its fleet. An X user shared a video of a lot teeming with the vehicles.\n\nAt a starting retail price of $80,000, SpaceX's purchases could add up to anywhere between $80 million to $160 million in sales for Tesla.\n\nAs Electrek pointed out, there is nothing illegal about Musk's machinations here. Still, essentially having to bail out a failing product isn't good news for Tesla nor the best move for SpaceX.\n\nInvestors certainly should be concerned that Musk's moves here are self-serving. There's also the matter of SpaceX receiving large help from the government, and then turning around and buying Cybertrucks.\n\n\"In other words, government subsidies that were meant to get us back to the moon are being used to buy unsellable trucks that look like big dumpsters,\" a frustrated commenter on Electrek opined.\n\nMusk's struggles in moving Cybertrucks provide another example of overpromising and underdelivering. Before it was released, the vehicle had over one million reservations. Only a mere 60,000 of those were converted into sales.\n\nDo you think America should produce more car parts than it does now?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nElectrek chalked up that failure to consumers picking up on a bait-and-switch from Tesla after unveiling their 2019 prototype. The actual Cybertruck is more expensive, has less range, and boasts fewer attractive features.",

    "description": "Trump suggested Democrats ‘loved Jeffrey Epstein’ and said they should ‘enjoy what may be your last Merry Christmas!’",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has shared a bizarre Christmas day social media post about Jeffrey Epstein, saying that he dropped ties with the late sex offender “long before it became fashionable,” and that the controversy surrounding the release of the so-called Epstein files is a “Radical Left Witch Hunt.”\n\nThe Trump administration has been facing ongoing scrutiny, mainly from Democrats but also some Republicans, for its handling of government files related to Epstein as the public pushes for more transparency about the disgraced financiers’ life and crimes.\n\n“Merry Christmas to all, including the many Sleazebags who loved Jeffrey Epstein...only to ‘drop him like a dog’ when things got too HOT, falsely claimed they had nothing to do with him, didn’t know him, said he was a disgusting person, and then blame, of course, President Donald J. Trump, who was actually the only one who did drop Epstein, and long before it became fashionable to do so,” Trump wrote on Truth Social Thursday evening.\n\nThe president was friends with Epstein decades ago, calling him a “terrific guy” in a 2002 New York magazine profile. In the midst of the Epstein controversy, The Wall Street Journal reported on a lewd birthday card Trump supposedly gave Epstein in 2003, but the president has denied that he authored such a letter.\n\nBut Trump has said their relationship ended before Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting a minor for prostitution. The White House has said Trump did “nothing wrong” and that the president kicked Epstein out of his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach for being a “creep.”\n\nTrump suggested in Wednesday’s Truth Social post that these people who thought Epstein was “the greatest guy on earth” were all Democrats.\n\n“When their names get brought out in the ongoing Radical Left Witch Hunt...and it is revealed that they are Democrats all, there will be a lot of explaining to do...Enjoy what may be your last Merry Christmas!” Trump wrote.\n\nWhen the Justice Department started to release its trove of Epstein documents last Friday — thanks to Congress pushing through legislation to force the Trump administration to reveal all the information it had on the convicted sex offender — photos of former Democratic President Bill Clinton emerged.\n\nIn one photo, Clinton and Epstein were smiling as they stood next to each other wearing silky shirts. In another, Clinton was swimming in a pool with Epstein’s longtime associate and convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell.",

    "fullText": "A theme park on the banks of the Potomac River outside Washington, DC, was abandoned over 50 years ago. The grounds are quiet, the attractions are empty, and long vines cover portions of the art deco structures.\n\nI'm talking about Glen Echo Park, in Glen Echo, Maryland.\n\nI visited in 2022 and found remnants of the park that once was, as well as an artists' hub that has developed since it closed.\n\nThe land was originally developed for a National Chautauqua Assembly that taught arts, literature, language, and sciences, according to the park's website.\n\nThe park housed several rides and attractions, including seven roller coasters, an arcade, and a pool, according to Atlas Obscura.\n\nThe park became decreasingly popular in the mid-1960s, and it closed after the 1968 season, according to the Library of Congress.\n\nOver time, organizations have repurposed the park's structures to house educational facilities, studios, galleries, and arts venues.\n\nThe entrance to the park had a gigantic sign visible from the adjacent highway. I imagine this must have helped attract visitors back in the day.\n\nThis stand and many other structures in the park were renovated between 2003 and 2010, according to a Glen Echo Park catalog.\n\nAccording to the park's site, the carousel pieces were hand-carved by the Dentzel Carousel Company in the early 1900s.\n\nEach animal was restored between 1983 and 2003, and the carousel is on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nWhile the teacups are gone, the space that covered them remains.\n\nToday, the buildings house galleries and educational facilities. I spotted a music school and a glass art school.\n\nAccording to the National Park Service, the pool was constructed in 1931 and could accommodate up to 3,000 people, featuring diving boards, a water slide, and an artificial beach.\n\nToday, parts of the area have been overrun by nature.\n\nAccording to the Glen Echo Park catalog, these yurts house art classes.\n\nInside, there are animal exhibits and interactive displays, as well as a submarine, according to the aquarium's website.\n\nStrolling through the woods was the perfect way to end my trip to this abandoned wonderland surrounded by nature.",

    "description": "Season four of \"Bridgerton,\" streaming on January 29, will center on Benedict Bridgerton's love story. Here's what we know so far.",
    "fullText": "Get your masks ready: Season four of \"Bridgerton\" is coming to Netflix in 2026. Part one premieres on January 29, and part two will come a month later on February 26.\n\nThis season will follow the story of Benedict Bridgerton and Sophie Baek in a \"Cinderella\"-esque tale.\n\nSeason three of the Netflix series, which centered on Colin Bridgerton (Luke Newton) and Penelope Featherington's (Nicola Coughlan) relationship, concluded with the release of part two in June 2024.\n\nIn giving Polin a happy ending, \"Bridgerton\" also teased that Benedict (Luke Thompson), the second-eldest sibling, would get the main character treatment next season. His status as the lead has officially been confirmed, and new details are slowly being announced — and now, fans are able to watch the first trailer for season four as a Christmas present from the streamer.\n\nHere's everything we know about season four of \"Bridgerton\" so far.\n\nAn official announcement about Benedict being the season four lead was made in July 2024. In a video posted by Netflix, Thompson is handed a suit for the masquerade ball. But eagle-eyed fans weren't surprised, because this was all teased in the season three finale that aired in June.\n\nAs Eloise Bridgerton (Claudia Jessie) prepared to head off to Scotland with Francesca Bridgerton (Hannah Dodd), John Stirling (Victor Alli), and Michaela Stirling (Masali Baduza) in the episode, she assured Benedict that she'd only be gone until next year.\n\n\"Do you think Mama would ever let me miss her Masquerade Ball?\" she said.\n\nBenedict, still not ready to settle down, replied, \"I will be there, hiding out behind a mask, avoiding eligible ladies like the plague.\"\n\nThat not-so-subtle moment was a nod to Benedict's novel \"An Offer from a Gentleman,\" which is part of Julia Quinn's \"Bridgerton\" book series.\n\nIn the third \"Cinderella\"-inspired book, Benedict meets a woman named Sophie Beckett at a masquerade ball. Unbeknownst to him, Sophie is a servant to a rude stepmother named Araminta Gunningworth. By the end of the novel, they express their love for each other and get married.\n\nThe show has changed Sophie's last name from Beckett to Baek to reflect actor Yerin Ha's Korean heritage.\n\n\"A name is the first bit of identity that you share with the world, and that's why changing a name can be so powerful,\" Ha told Tudum. \"To make Sophie's name fit someone who looks like me is really empowering. All credit to Jess Brownell, our showrunner.\"\n\nNetflix's official logline for next season reads: \"The fourth season of 'Bridgerton' turns its focus to bohemian second son Benedict (Luke Thompson). Despite his elder and younger brothers both being happily married, Benedict is loath to settle down — until he meets a captivating Lady in Silver at his mother's masquerade ball.\"\n\nHere's the first full official trailer for the fourth season.\n\nHa was most recently seen on the Paramount+ TV series adaptation of the \"Halo\" video game franchise and HBO's \"Dune\" spin-off series \"Dune: Prophecy.\"\n\nDespite the character being based on Cinderella, Brownell assured fans that Sophie is \"no damsel in distress.\"\n\n\"She is someone who has chess moves and is always thinking two, three steps ahead,\" Brownell said at the \"Bridgerton\" virtual fan event called \"Season of Love\" in February 2025. \"So she's absolutely gonna throw Benedict for a loop.\"\n\nKatie Leung, who played Cho Chang in the \"Harry Potter\" film series, will portray Lady Araminta Gao.\n\nHer character description reads: \"Twice-married and twice-widowed, Araminta has two daughters debuting on the marriage mart this season and she's feeling the pressure to get at least one of her girls married off. Fabulous, discerning, and blunt, Araminta does not respond well when anything — or anyone — threatens her standing in society.\"\n\nMichelle Mao will play Rosamund Li, Araminta's eldest daughter who's \"beautiful, vain, and eager to please her mother.\" According to her official description, Rosamund will be vying for Benedict's heart when she hits the marriage mart.\n\nIsabella Wei will play Posy Li, Araminta's youngest daughter, who's described as kind and chatty.\n\nAt the \"Season of Love\" event, Brownell said that the new installment will show Colin as a \"wife guy\" and the couple raising their baby, whose name has yet to be revealed.\n\nBrownell previously told TheWrap that she'd like the pair to continue on the show beyond season four because she thinks there are more stories to be told. Newton similarly told Teen Vogue that he's committed to staying on the show indefinitely.\n\nBrownell elaborated on Polin's place in season four in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, saying that the couple will shift to being part of the larger ensemble.\n\n\"I do think that there is a bit more to tell story-wise with Whistledown,\" she said. \"Whistledown has been the narrative glue of every season. Now that Penelope's out publicly as Whistledown, I want to see more of what that's like. So, we will continue with them next season for sure.\"\n\nOn December 21, the \"Bridgerton\" X account announced that Colin and Penelope's newborn son, Elliot, would be part of the season's story.\n\nIn addition to the confirmed returns of Coughlan and Newton, Julie Andrews will also be back as the voice of Lady Whistledown.\n\nKanthony fans have been wondering how long Kate (Simone Ashley) and Anthony Bridgerton (Jonathan Bailey) will stay on the show after leading season two.\n\nPrevious season leads have largely stepped away after their story arcs concluded, but Anthony and Kate are the new heads of the Bridgerton household, which means they have to stick around.\n\nIn season three, Anthony and Kate show up in four episodes, often disappearing on trips around the world. The show writers likely did this to explain the characters' disappearance so Ashley and Bailey could film other projects (Bailey, in particular, was pulling triple duty, also working on \"Wicked\" and \"Fellow Travelers\").\n\nIn season three, episode seven, Anthony and Kate leave for a trip to India so Kate can visit her home and give birth to their first child. Though this looks like a convenient way to write the couple off the show entirely, that's not the case.\n\nBrownell told Entertainment Weekly in June that Anthony and Kate heading to India allows the two actors to work on other projects \"while still leaving the door open for them to return when and if they're able.\"\n\n\"So the India send-off is a plot device in certain ways that allows us to leave the door open,\" she said.\n\nAnd the \"Bridgerton\" virtual event in February 2025 officially confirmed that Bailey and Ashley are indeed returning, including both in the official cast list for season four of \"Bridgerton.\"\n\nFans will see \"more of their marital bliss and seeing their baby as well,\" Brownell said.\n\nHowever, fans didn't get a glimpse of them in the first trailer.\n\nAfter tying the knot at the end of season three — and meeting her husband's intriguing cousin, Michaela — Francesca and John will be back for at least the beginning of season four before heading back to Scotland.\n\nFans of the book series know that Francesca's time as the series' main character is coming. Her book, the sixth in the series, is called \"When He Was Wicked.\"\n\nWe won't spoil the story for anyone who hasn't read Julia Quinn's books (though you can read about Francesca's book here), but it's safe to say that the show made one of its biggest departures from the book series when it introduced John's cousin, Michaela. In the novel, John's beloved cousin is named Michael.\n\nAt the virtual event, Brownell teased where fans will see the \"Bridgerton\" characters at the start of season four.\n\nThe showrunner alluded to Lady Violet Bridgerton (Ruth Gemmell) continuing her flirtations with Lord Marcus Anderson (Daniel Francis) and moving beyond the giggling that defined their season three interactions.\n\nViolet will also be busy trying to prepare her unmarried kids for the future. While Francesca got married last season, her siblings Eloise and Hyacinth (Florence Hunt) haven't reached that milestone yet.\n\n\"Violet is once again trying to put Eloise on the marriage mart and she's absolutely dreading it,\" Brownell said.\n\nOn the flip side, Hyacinth \"is desperate to pre-debut early. And the two of them get paired together this season for comedic results.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Gregory (Will Tilston), the youngest son, is \"going to get sent off to Eton for a little while, but that gives him time to come back no longer a gangly teenager but a young man.\"\n\nAs for the rest of the Ton, Brownell said that fans will see more of Queen Charlotte (Golda Rosheuvel), who has a new dynamic with Penelope now that she knows who Lady Whistledown is. Additionally, season four will expand on Queen Charlotte and Lady Agatha Danbury's (Adjoa Andoh) relationship.\n\nLady Danbury, who often vacillates between meddling and advising other characters, will help Will (Martins Imhangbe) and Alice Mondrich (Emma Naomi) navigate a new challenge as they settle into being members of society.\n\nSeason three of \"Bridgerton\" gives more insight into Cressida's (Jessica Madsen) difficult home life and the lengths she'll go to in order to get out of her situation.\n\nDuring the season, she attempts to take credit for Lady Whistledown so she can receive the reward money and avoid marrying an older man, but the plan backfires. Then, when she learns that Penelope is Lady Whistledown, she attempts to blackmail her with the intention of using the money to escape town and avoid being sent off to live with her aunt in Wales.\n\nBut Cressida is outsmarted and is last seen being sent away in a carriage to live with her relative after tarnishing the Cowper family's reputation.\n\nIn separate June 2024 interviews with The Hollywood Reporter, Entertainment Weekly, and The Los Angeles Times, Brownell said that Cressida's story isn't over yet.\n\n\"It felt a little early in this season for her to get a happily ever after just because we've watched two seasons of her being a real bully to Penelope. She has a little bit more growth to do, but I do want to give her a happy ending eventually,\" she told EW.\n\n\"We want to see more from Jessica Madsen,\" Brownell told THR. \"So we wanted to leave her story a little bit more open-ended so that we can craft an ending for her in future seasons.\"\n\nAt the virtual event, Brownell said that every season follows a romantic trope, and season four is all about \"forbidden love.\"\n\n\"That class clash gives us a very serious obstacle and the stakes could not be higher this year, so it's really a juicy one,\" she said.\n\n\"The theme of the season is really about true love being somewhere in between fantasy and reality,\" Brownell added.\n\nThe new season will delve into Benedict's status as a member of high society and Sophie's role as a maid. And after spending three seasons focusing on the happenings of the wealthy characters, season four will broaden the world to follow the working-class characters below them.\n\n\"Because you are now so familiar with the upstairs, I think viewers know just how difficult a pairing between a gentleman and a maid will be,\" Brownell said.\n\nHa said that Sophie's job as a maid at Penwood House, where she works for Lady Araminta, is high stakes.\n\n\"Living under that Penwood House is a mode of survival for her because if she doesn't, then she has nowhere else to go,\" Ha said. \"I think it also highlights just how hard it was being a maid in that era. You mess up and your life can turn upside down in a second, and I think we're trying really hard to portray those dynamics.\"\n\nBrownell said that the all-important masquerade ball where Benedict and Sophie meet will be \"a very large chunk of the first episode.\" She also said that the aesthetic of the ball was inspired by William Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" and the vibe is \"dark and mysterious and fairytale-like.\"\n\nFans can see a glimpse of Benedict looking enamored by Sophie at the masquerade ball in a sneak peek clip posted by Netflix in May.\n\nAside from the masquerade ball, season four will pull additional elements from the book, like My Cottage — which is Benedict's countryside home — and a nearby lake that fans of the novel will be familiar with.\n\n\"I do think that this season is the most faithful to the book,\" Brownell said. \"It really lends itself to adaptation plot-wise. It's very similar.\"\n\nStill, some aspects were changed for the Netflix adaptation, like character motivations.\n\n\"Benedict is quite different from the book just in that Luke Thompson brings this wonderful sensitivity and self-awareness to the character,\" Brownell said. \"So in Benedict's story of trying to woo Sophie, I think the character is a bit more delicate and thoughtful, perhaps, about the way he goes about it.\"\n\nBrownell told the Los Angeles Times that they chose to film the season during the fall partly for storytelling purposes, but also out of practicality.\n\n\"It's still going to be just as lush and colorful, but just \n\nNetflix confirmed that season four will consist of episodes, just like the past installments. The two parts will air on January 29 and February 26.\n\nIn addition to the coming fourth season, \"Bridgerton\" has been renewed for seasons five and six.\n\nThis is a developing story.

    "title": "Why retirement may be harder to reach for many older Americans in 2026",
    "description": "More older Americans are returning to work due to financial insecurity and rising costs, as surveys show retirees fear their savings won't last,",
    "fullText": "It may be increasingly common next year to see an older worker staffing the cash register at your local grocery store.\n\nSurveys released in recent months suggest that older Americans are more worried about having to unretire, fearing their savings won't last them 20 to 30 years. US Bank's 2025 Wealth Report, released in September, shows that nearly two-thirds of Americans worry they may have to reenter the workforce, while 58% of people believe their money will last them in their retirement years.\n\nThis is echoed by ResumeBuilder.com's survey of 3,574 Americans aged 65 and older, released last week. The survey reveals that nearly one in eight plan to rejoin the workforce in 2026 or already have. Over a third of older Americans still working don't plan to retire until the next decade. About 4% of older Americans surveyed are applying for jobs, while 8% returned to work over the last few years. Slightly over 70% reported being retired. These findings are similar to the past two iterations of the survey.\n\nAnd a third survey from AARP Research from October found that 6% of retirees went back to work in the past six months due to a negative economic outlook.\n\nOver the past year, I've spoken to over 250 older Americans, most of whom still work. The majority said they never retired or unretired because of financial uncertainty. Some lived paycheck to paycheck with limited savings and no defined-benefit pension plan. Others had six figures in the bank but knew the money would run dry if they faced a sudden diagnosis or emergency. Many others worked because they wanted to feel fulfilled, have a purpose and a community, and stay active.\n\nAs Americans reflect on 2025 in its final week, many retirees are calculating and stress-testing if they have enough to endure various financial situations. For those falling short, unretiring may be the best option.\n\nIn 2021, the Bureau of Labor Statistics outlined that the labor force for Americans 75 and older is expected to grow by upwards of 96% through 2030. Census Bureau data shows that in 2024, nearly 20% of people 65 and older worked at least part-time.\n\nTo be sure, the unretirement rate from pre-COVID through mid-2024 has steadily declined from 3.2% in late 2018 to 1.9%, which suggests older workers are struggling to rejoin the labor market.\n\nMy 80 Over 80 series, which explored why people continue to work into their 80s and 90s, found that 4.2% of Americans 80 and older work, the highest it's been in decades. Many unretired after months, years, or decades of not working.\n\nThese recent surveys, as well as some from earlier this year, show that retirement is elongating as life spans grow — and may be harder to achieve in the coming years.\n\n\"Because of the rise in costs, people's fixed incomes, their Social Security benefits, aren't enough to cover all their expenses,\" said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democrat from New York, in an interview with Business Insider. \"We know that 47% of workers lack access to employer-sponsored retirement plans, and 55% report no dedicated retirement savings. We know that many seniors won't have enough money to retire comfortably.\"\n\nSurveys published this year continue to show that Americans prioritize a healthy and stable retirement. However, many aren't taking the necessary steps to get there, and many aren't in financial or employment situations to do so.\n\nThe US Bank report found that 37% of working adults are actively preparing for retirement, while 48% of Americans contribute to their retirement savings. Nearly a quarter of Generation X respondents said they have abandoned their goal of retiring. Three-quarters of millennials and Generation Z worried about needing to come out of retirement, as many of the traditional milestones — buying a house or starting a family — feel harder to grasp.\n\nThis year hasn't done many favors for older Americans, either. The Resume Builder survey found that 54% of older Americans who still work or are unretiring cited the high cost of living, while a similar amount said they enjoyed work. Inflation has remained stubbornly high this year, registering at 2.7% for the 12 months ending in November. Inflation has been higher than the overall average for housing and various medical expenses.\n\nThe survey further found that over a quarter of older workers were nervous about potential Social Security changes, while a fifth were concerned about Medicare changes.\n\n\"For many seniors, retirement has become more flexible than final,\" said ResumeBuilder.com's chief career advisor Stacie Haller in the survey release. \"At the same time, today's workplace offers far more flexible opportunities for older professionals.\"\n\nFaced with a difficult job market, though, many older Americans said they won't relinquish their job because they anticipate not being able to find another, citing factors such as ageism. The AARP Research survey found that nearly two-thirds of older workers believe it would be challenging for them to find another job, especially since older workers already experience longer stretches of unemployment on average than younger people.\n\nOthers who unretired said they've opted for part-time employment or gig work, which were easier to secure and maintain. A few returned to school or took online classes to improve their skills in hopes of finding more stable employment.\n\nTo be sure, many of those still working into their 70s, 80s, and 90s told Business Insider that they wouldn't retire even if they had the means to. However, dozens said they wished they could work fewer hours, more flexible hours, or in a different profession that didn't wear them down as much.\n\nThroughout the year, experts on retirement and aging stressed that returning to work was not something to view as shameful. Research papers overwhelmingly show the benefits of continuing to work in one's later years, such as sustained cognitive function and improved mental health outcomes — provided the worker has flexibility and can handle the job.\n\nThese insights seemed to put some older readers at ease. In interviews, dozens of workers in their 80s said they felt like a failure for not being in a position to retire or pass down a significant inheritance to their children, though hearing that they weren't alone made them feel more confident. In responses and emails to my articles, some older readers said they considered going back to work after reading about many people who successfully did so.\n\nDozens of politicians, researchers on aging, and anti-ageism advocates said more should be done in the short term to ensure older Americans have the employment opportunities they need to live comfortably and have more financial support to guide them through their later years. To be sure, some experts said that returning to work shouldn't be the long-term solution, as the safety net should be more robust so people only need to return to work if they desire.\n\n\"A lot of our older adults need resources to survive, and so we want to make sure that the workforce is available to them, and they won't be discriminated against from being hired and working if they need to,\" Gillibrand said in reference to the Protecting Older Americans Act she co-introduced.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump might be president, but even he has to endure holiday dinners with his in-laws.\n\nTrump, 79, spent Christmas Eve at his Mar-a-Lago estate alongside family members including First Lady Melania Trump, 55, and her father, Viktor Knavs—who is just two years the president’s senior.\n\nThe trio was seated together at an extravagant Christmas Eve dinner Wednesday night at the Palm Beach resort, which Forbes valued at $325 million in 2023. In video footage circulating online from the event, Knavs, 81, appears animated as he chats with his daughter, who leans in closely to hear him.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, stares straight ahead, seemingly frozen out of the conversation. He sits glumly scanning the room before he notices the camera is on him, prompting a stiff, performative fist shake.\n\nCritics of the president were quick to seize on the moment online, pointing to what they described as Melania’s lack of interest. “Could she sit any farther away?” one X user quipped. “Trump seethes with rage & embarrassment that Melania only wants to talk to her dad,” another wrote in a post viewed 1.6 million times.\n\nKnavs and his late wife, Amalija, both worked in fashion and sales in Slovenia before relocating to the United States after their daughter married the real estate scion. They became naturalized U.S. citizens in 2018, despite their son-in-law’s hardline stance on immigration.\n\nA fixture of the president’s family life, Knavs has appeared at events ranging from Trump’s inauguration to his Thanksgiving dinner table. When Barron Trump—the president’s youngest son and the only child he shares with the first lady—graduated from the prestigious Oxbridge Academy in West Palm Beach, Florida, in May 2024, Knavs was the only family member in attendance besides Barron’s parents, the Palm Beach Post reported.\n\nMelania Trump and Barron Trump are both known to have close relationships with the Slovenian businessman. Melania Trump was largely absent from the now-president’s third and final campaign as she cared for her mother, Amalija Knavs, who died Jan. 9, 2024, and was laid to rest in Palm Beach, according to reports.\n\nBarron Trump remained close to his grandfather throughout the funeral, according to reports.\n\nIn 2016, Melania Trump’s childhood friends told The New York Times that they remembered Knavs—who was a member of the elite Communist Party in what was then Yugoslavia—as a “larger-than-life personality” much like Trump himself.\n\nAt the time, Trump’s campaign denied that Melania Trump’s father was ever an “active member” of the party.\n\n“But he was pretty successful over there,” Trump said in a 2016 interview. “It’s a different kind of success than you have here. But he was successful.”\n\nTrump may have appeared fatigued at dinner after a jam-packed afternoon, during which he took calls from children across the United States as part of the North American Aerospace Defense Command’s Santa tracker.\n\nIn true Trump fashion, the decades-old presidential tradition took a political turn.\n\n“Pennsylvania is great. We won Pennsylvania, actually three times, but we won Pennsylvania. We won it in a landslide. So I love Pennsylvania,” Trump enthusiastically told a 5-year-old from the Keystone State—who was not yet alive during his first two presidential campaigns.\n\nThe president later capped off Christmas Eve with a scathing post on Truth Social, decrying what he called the “Radical Left Scum.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",

    "fullText": "MARACAY, Venezuela (AP) — This was not the Christmas that Mariela Gómez would have imagined a year ago. Or the one that thousands of other Venezuelan immigrants would have thought. But Donald Trump returned to the White House in January and quickly ended their American dream.\n\nSo Gómez found herself spending the holiday in northern Venezuela for the first time in eight years. She dressed up, cooked, got her son a scooter and smiled for her in-laws. Hard as she tried, though, she could not ignore the main challenges faced by returning migrants: unemployment and poverty.\n\n“We had a modest dinner, not quite what we’d hoped for, but at least we had food on the table,” Gómez said of the lasagna-like dish she shared with her partner and in-laws instead of the traditional Christmas dish of stuffed corn dough hallacas. “Making hallacas here is a bit expensive, and since we’re unemployed, we couldn’t afford to make them.”\n\nGómez, her two sons and her partner returned to the city of Maracay on Oct. 27 after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border to Texas, where they were quickly swept up by U.S. Border Patrol amid the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration. They were deported to Mexico, from where they began the dangerous journey back to Venezuela.\n\nThey crossed Central America by bus, but once in Panama, the family could not afford to continue to Colombia via boat in the Caribbean. Instead, they took the cheaper route along the Pacific’s choppy waters, sitting on top of sloshing gasoline tanks in a cargo boat for several hours and then transferring to a fast boat until reaching a jungled area of Colombia. They spent about two weeks there until they were wired money to make it to the border with Venezuela.\n\nGómez was among the more than 7.7 million Venezuelans who left their home country in the last decade, when its economy came undone as a result of a drop in oil prices, corruption and mismanagement. She lived in Colombia and Peru for years before setting her sights on the U.S. with hopes of building a new life.\n\nTrump’s second term has dashed the hopes of many like Gómez.\n\nAs of September, more than 14,000 migrants, mostly from Venezuela, had returned to South America since Trump moved to limit migration to the U.S., according to figures from Colombia, Panama and Costa Rica. In addition, Venezuelans were steadily deported to their home country this year after President Nicolás Maduro, under pressure from the White House, did away with his long-standing policy of not accepting deportees from the U.S.\n\nImmigrants arrived regularly at the airport outside the capital, Caracas, on flights operated by a U.S. government contractor or Venezuela’s state-owned airline. More than 13,000 immigrants returned this year on the chartered flights.\n\nGómez’s return to Venezuela also allowed her to see the now 20-year-old daughter she left behind when she fled the country’s complex crisis. They talked and drank beer during the holiday knowing it might be the last time they share a drink for a while — Gómez’s daughter will migrate to Brazil next month.\n\nGómez is hoping to make hallacas for New Year’s Eve and is also hoping for a job. But her prayers for next year are mostly for good health.\n\n“I ask God for many things, first and foremost life and health, so we can continue enjoying our family,” she said.\n\nGarcia Cano reported from Caracas.",

    "description": "\"One of the reasons I want a Tesla!\"",
    "fullText": "A passerby noticed an unexpected passenger peering out the window of a parked Tesla — a puppy. While such a sight is often worrying, a unique Tesla feature put their mind at ease.\n\n\"Spotted the cutest floof,\" a Facebook user shared in a Dogspotting group. The Tesla's touchscreen reads, \"My driver will be back soon,\" and displays the internal temperature of the electric vehicle as 22 degrees Celsius (around 72 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nWhile leaving a pet in a car may not seem dangerous, temperatures can heat up quickly, particularly on a hot day. Analysis from Total.vet found that the majority of heat-related pet deaths occurred when the animal's owners left them trapped inside hot vehicles.\n\nBecause of this, California and other states have laws allowing rescues under certain conditions. However, this can lead to unnecessarily broken glass if a vehicle is running remotely, leaving the pet in a safe and comfortable environment.\n\nTesla's \"Dog Mode\" ingeniously eliminates the potential for misunderstanding. Other Facebook users were impressed by the adorable display.\n\n\"One of the reasons I want a Tesla!\" one commenter shared.\n\n\"That Tesla feature omg. I hate them but I'd buy it specifically for my dogs,\" another said.\n\nAs evidenced by the fact that this Facebook post is a couple of years old, Tesla has been a polarizing brand for years. Anti-EV sentiment fueled by misinformation has played a role, while CEO Elon Musk's political activities and social media feuds have turned the company into a lightning rod for criticism in 2025, even contributing to a sales slump in key markets.\n\nMore broadly, though, demand for EVs remains robust.\n\nTesla itself even delivered a record number of vehicles in the third quarter as consumers rushed to take advantage of expiring EV tax credits in the U.S.\n\nEVs are shockingly cheaper to power up, particularly if you charge at home.\n\nIn fact, you could save hundreds of dollars per year. Qmerit offers instant, free installation estimates for Level 2 chargers.\n\nWould you rather have a Tesla or a Corvette?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nReady to maximize your savings associated with driving an EV? Try charging with your own energy rather than relying on the main grid. TCD's Solar Explorer can save you up to $10,000 on solar. EnergySage, one of TCD's Solar Explorer partners, makes it easy to obtain and compare competitive quotes from vetted installers.\n\nAnd whereas gas-powered cars spew toxic pollution responsible for millions of premature deaths every year — not to mention an overheating planet making things more dangerous for humans and pets alike — electric vehicles produce zero tailpipe emissions.\n\nIn the meantime, another Facebook user said they wanted to see a similar feature in other vehicles. Fortunately, multiple manufacturers have stepped up with their own versions of Dog Mode, giving many consumers yet another reason to make their next car an EV.\n\n\"Every car should have this option. So cool!\" the user exclaimed.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "This isn’t the first time Zuckerberg has clashed with neighbors over real estate projects.",
    "fullText": "Billionaire Mark Zuckerberg has been rankling his neighbors in Palo Alto as he works on expanding and modifying the 11 homes that he has purchased in the area. To smooth over tensions, The New York Times says Zuckerberg gifted his next-door neighbors noise-canceling headphones as a peace offering.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, the billionaire cofounder of Facebook and CEO of Meta, reportedly gave noise-canceling headphones to his neighbors in the Crescent Park neighborhood of Palo Alto in an effort to address years of frustration over ongoing construction and disruption surrounding his expanding residential compound, according to The New York Times.\n\nZuckerberg has spent more than $110 million purchasing at least 11 homes on Edgewood Drive and Hamilton Avenue over the past 14 years, transforming this once-idyllic neighborhood of lawyers, business executives, and Stanford University professors into a zone dominated by construction equipment, surveillance, and frequent lavish parties.\n\nSome of these properties that were recently purchased sit unoccupied, despite being in a region known for its acute housing shortage, while others have been converted into guest homes, lush gardens, a pickleball court, a pool with a hydrofloor, and—at least for a time—a private school for Zuckerberg’s children and several others (a use that appears not to comply with local zoning ordinances).\n\nUnderneath the compound, Zuckerberg added 7,000 square feet of space described as “basements,” which to area residents are more akin to “bunkers” or a “billionaire’s bat cave.” Zuckerberg similarly added a 5,000-square-foot underground structure to his compound in Hawaii, which he insists is not a “doomsday bunker.”\n\nMuch of the discontent centers on the nearly eight years of continual construction. Several neighbors cited street blockages, debris, and relentless noise as ongoing issues.\n\nA spokesperson for Mark Zuckerberg provided the following statement to Fortune:\n\n“Mark, Priscilla and their children have made Palo Alto their home for more than a decade. They value being members of the community and have taken a number of steps above and beyond any local requirements to avoid disruption in the neighborhood.”\n\nThe noise-canceling headphones were among several gifts extended by Zuckerberg’s staff to appease neighbors during particularly loud periods, along with bottles of sparkling wine and boxes of Krispy Kreme doughnuts. These gestures, however, have not always been effective. Some of his neighbors say their community has been transformed—and not in a good way—by absentee ownership, strict privacy barriers, and heavy security presence, including cameras overlooking adjacent properties and frequent patrols by private security guards.\n\nMeta didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThis is not Zuckerberg’s first clash with neighbors over real estate projects. In 2016, Palo Alto officials rejected a proposal to demolish four homes and replace them with smaller houses and large basements as part of a wider compound. While the city denied the specific application, Zuckerberg ultimately proceeded gradually, undertaking similar work in a piecemeal fashion to avoid further regulatory hurdles. The Palo Alto City Council and some residents have since criticized what they describe as the exploitation of zoning loopholes and the city’s regulatory inaction.\n\nZuckerberg’s residential portfolio extends far beyond Palo Alto. He owns a 2,300-acre estate in Kauai, Hawaii, where his land acquisitions and building plans have at times provoked local controversy as well. He also owns homes at Lake Tahoe and a mansion in Washington, D.C.\n\nA version of this story was published at Fortune.com on Aug. 26, 2025.\n\nZuckerberg defends Meta’s spending spree, says ‘the risk is higher on the other side’\n\n‘The Social Network’ nailed Mark Zuckerberg’s wardrobe, Facebook founder admits\n\nWhy Mark Zuckerberg says the ‘most important thing’ he built at Harvard was a prank website\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "description": "Aaron Cannon thought up his startup, Outset, while on paternity leave. As his kid has grown up, so has the company.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Aaron Cannon, the 37-year-old founder of Outset, who resides in San Francisco with his wife and three-year-old son. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI decided to start my company while I was on paternity leave.\n\nIt's very woven together: starting a family and starting a startup happened along a similar timeline. I definitely have a lot of people who think that's a little insane. It is. I have wistful moments thinking about, \"Man, what if I could do all this when I was 25 and single?\"\n\nThen I quickly remind myself that I was an idiot when I was 25.\n\nWhen I was on paternity leave, I maybe had too much time to think. When you have a baby, you are all hands on deck physically, but you don't have a lot of intellectual stimulation. I was daydreaming about what I wanted to do with my career.\n\nIt's a very intense balance. \"Work-life balance\" implies a certain degree of chillness. I don't have that. Every minute of my day matters. Everything gets deprioritized except family and work. That's painful. It's really ruthless prioritization.\n\nIt's very weird mentally. In a normal job, you have really intense days, and you come home and you tell your family, \"I've got to take a breather.\" The problem is, every day at my job right now is intense. Our startup is in that crazy growth stage where everything is growing and breaking at the same time.\n\nIf I come home and say, \"Ugh, this is so intense,\" then I'm not going to be as present as a dad. I don't have that option.\n\nYesterday, on the way home, I had an intense call after work. I'm negotiating this contract. Then I pick up my kid, and I spend the next 20 minutes explaining seasons to him. I started with, \"Do you understand what a year is?\" No. Where do you even start? It's a crazy mental shift.\n\nI pick him up every day, which forces a boundary. Thank goodness, my cofounder and I have different lives. He stays later, I come earlier. As long as the two of us are showing up in the way the founders need to, great.\n\nBut I leave. I go and pick up my kid every day from preschool. I take him home. I do dinner. I get him to bed. Then I'm back on for work. Those are a precious couple of hours.\n\nEven if I'm physically present, it is very hard after the most intense day of work to just shut that off. You can set physical world boundaries and still be mentally there or not there. I want to be as deeply engaged as possible.\n\nWe went through Y Combinator back in 2023, and I was definitely on the older side. On Wednesday nights, we had speakers and programs, and that was not easy for me.\n\nBeing a dad provides perspective. It is easy to take any big thing or small thing that's happening and obsess as a founder. You are the company, the company is you. When I get home and have to explain what seasons are, it's a reminder: Why are we doing this? It zooms you out.\n\nIt also helps reinforce my motivations. I want my kid growing up, seeing his dad do a big swing in his career and try something crazy. That's a lesson and an example I want to set for him. You can go build something yourself.\n\nIt's a chapter of my life, but it's not all of my life. It's intense. I should expect it to be that way.\n\nThe most important thing is that I'm present as a dad. I don't get these years back. He's only three for one year.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump are spending Christmas at their Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nIn between rounds of golf at the nearby Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, the president announced a new \"Trump-class\" of ships, called service members to wish them a merry Christmas, and spoke to children while tracking Santa Claus' journey from the North Pole.\n\nHe also commented on the Jeffrey Epstein files for the first time since the Justice Department released images and documents on December 19 as part of the Epstein Files Transparency Act.\n\nThe Christmas holiday marks Trump's 16th visit to Mar-a-Lago in 2025. He is expected to remain in Palm Beach through January 4.\n\nTake a look at Mar-a-Lago's lavish Christmas celebrations.\n\nThe president flew to Palm Beach on Air Force One after holding a rally in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. First lady Melania Trump did not appear to be traveling with him.\n\nThe golf club is located around 4.5 miles from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nJoined by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Secretary of the Navy John Phelan, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump said that the \"Trump-class\" would eventually include 20 to 25 ships.\n\nPhelan said the first of these ships to be built will be the USS Defiant, an 880-foot-long, heavily armed battleship with a crew of 850. Some of its planned weaponry is still in development, such as the Sea-Launched Cruise Missile-Nuclear, or SLCM-N.\n\nAt the press conference, Trump also addressed the Epstein files for the first time since they were officially released on December 19.\n\nTrump acknowledged that he appeared in photos released by the Justice Department, saying that Epstein \"was all over Palm Beach and other places.\"\n\n\"What this whole thing is with Epstein is a way of trying to deflect from the tremendous success that the Republican Party has,\" he said.\n\nDonald Trump rode through Palm Beach in \"The Beast,\" the armored presidential limousine.\n\nTrump thanked service members for their \"extraordinary devotion and service to America\" and touted his $1,776 \"warrior dividend\" bonus checks sent to military members ahead of Christmas.\n\nTrump moved gold angel statues from the ceiling of Mar-a-Lago's Grand Ballroom to the doorways in the Oval Office, which he has redecorated to more closely resemble the gold-covered walls of his Palm Beach estate.\n\nThat night, Trump shared a holiday message on Truth Social.\n\n\"Merry Christmas to all, including the Radical Left Scum that is doing everything possible to destroy our Country, but are failing badly,\" he wrote.",

    "description": "A recent update from the Department of Education said that just 170 student-loan borrowers received income-driven repayment discharges in November.",
    "fullText": "Thousands of student-loan borrowers are stuck in limbo.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's Department of Education provided an update on the progress it has made in processing student-loan borrowers' income-driven repayment applications in a court filing last week. It seems the department still has a lot of work to do: 802,730 IDR applications are pending as of November 30.\n\nPer the court filing, the department discharged the loans of 170 student-loan borrowers who were on IDR plans in November, with another 280 discharges for borrowers who had completed their payments through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which forgives student debt for government and nonprofit workers after 10 years of qualifying payments.\n\nThe updates are a result of an agreement the Department of Education reached with the American Federation of Teachers, which accused the department in a lawsuit of delaying processing and denying borrowers the relief they're owed.\n\nIn October, the department also said in a court filing in the AFT lawsuit that it would process more forgiveness for borrowers on income-driven repayment plans, appearing to be a commitment to keep working through the backlog. The latest update leaves it uncertain as to how quickly the department intends to process applications and grant relief to borrowers who complete their qualifying number of payments.\n\nBeginning in July 2026, the department is set to begin implementing major repayment changes that Trump signed into law in his \"big beautiful\" spending legislation. These include a new repayment plan, borrowing limits for graduate, professional, and parent loans, and changes to PSLF eligibility.\n\nTax changes are also coming. A 2021 provision in the American Rescue Plan that made student-loan forgiveness tax-free is set to expire in January, meaning that borrowers who reach their qualifying number of payments for relief in 2026 could face thousands of dollars in taxes. The department confirmed, however, that borrowers who reached their payment threshold before 2026 but did not yet have their discharge approved would not face taxes.\n\nStudent-loan borrowers told Business Insider that they're bracing for higher payments next year as a result of the slew of repayment changes, along with uncertainty as to how those changes will play out.\n\n\"My overall general feeling is anxiety and nervousness about it because we really don't know what's going to happen,\" Jennifer Oakes, a 41-year-old borrower, said.",

I am also talking about the academy in that and the brilliant work that goes on down there.\n\n\"If we can move everything forward in terms of facilities - not that I believe facilities are the be all and end all - but they are a great way of setting standards higher and showing your ambition in a really clear and strong way.\"",
