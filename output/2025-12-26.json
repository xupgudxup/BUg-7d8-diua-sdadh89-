    "fullText": "Dak Prescott falls 1 game shy of Tony Romo’s record Cowboys streak after beating Commanders appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nThe Dallas Cowboys are not going to the playoffs this season, but they had enough gas in the tank to ruin Christmas Day for the Washington Commanders. The Cowboys pulled off a 30-23 road victory over their long-time rivals, and quarterback Dak Prescott threw for 307 yards and 2 touchdowns in the win.\n\nThe Cowboys jumped in front early and built a 21-3 lead midway through the second quarter before the Commanders did enough to make it a close game in the second half. However, the Commanders never threatened the lead.\n\nThe Cowboys (7-8-1) have a chance to finish the season at .500 if they can beat the New York Giants in the season finale, while the Commanders (4-12) will close against the NFC East champion Philadelphia Eagles. The Commanders made it all the way to the NFC title game a year ago, but this season has been a disaster for head coach Dan Quinn.\n\nWhile Prescott was able to impose his will on the Washington defense, he saw his streak of completing 60 percent or more of his passes come to an end at 15 games. Prescott completed 19 of 37 passes for 51.4 percent. If Prescott had been able to complete 60 percent of his passes against Washington, he would have passed Tony Romo for the longest streak in Cowboys history.\n\nWhile Prescott was able to make his share of big plays, the Dallas ground game came through with a couple of big performances. Second-year running back Malik Davis carried the ball 20 times for 103 yards. The Cowboys also received a complementary showing from Javonte Williams as he had 13 carries for 54 yards and a touchdown.\n\nKaVontae Turpin provided a huge highlight for the Cowboys when he used his speed to streak through the Washington secondary and catch an 86-yard TD pass from Prescott in the second quarter. The scoring play was the only reception of the game by the 4-year veteran from TCU.",

    "fullText": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — The Denver Broncos placed center Luke Wattenberg on injured reserve before their game against the Kansas City Chiefs on Thursday night, a surprising and significant blow to their offensive line as they take aim at a postseason berth.\n\nWattenberg had started the first 15 games of the season before showing up on the injury report with a shoulder problem this week. The move to the IR means he will be out at least four weeks, which would take the Broncos though the AFC title game.\n\nTheir first order of business is winning the AFC West. They can do it this weekend with a win over the Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium and by getting some help from Houston with a victory over the Chargers in Los Angeles on Saturday.\n\nWattenberg, a fifth-round pick in the 2022 draft out of Washington, has been solid in the middle for the Broncos all season. And last month, the team rewarded the 28-year-old offensive lineman with a four-year, $48 million contract extension.\n\nAlex Forsyth was starting in his place against Kansas City. He played four games when Wattenberg was injured last season.\n\nThe Broncos also promoted tight end Marcedes Lewis and offensive lineman Calvin Throckmorton, promoted linebacker Levelle Bailey and wide receiver Michael Bandy, and waived running back Cody Schrader amid a flurry of roster moves Thursday.\n\nThe 41-year-old Lewis was signed in late October and has appeared in four games for Denver. He's providing some depth at tight end while Nate Adkins continues to deal with a lingering knee injury.\n\nBailey is providing depth with linebacker Dre Greenlaw out with a hamstring injury, and Bandy is doing the same at wide receiver, where the Broncos are missing rookie Pat Bryant in the concussion protocol.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens have had a disastrous year, with a campaign that began with Super Bowl aspirations quickly devolving into a frustrating December defined by injuries, losses, and mounting questions about the franchise's future. Now, with their playoff hopes hanging by the thinnest of threads, their biggest star is severely hobbled, as two-time MVP quarterback Lamar Jackson is battling a painful back contusion that has kept him out of practice for the second consecutive day.\n\nThe back injury, sustained in Sunday night's loss to the New England Patriots, is described by Head Coach John Harbaugh as a \"legitimate, very painful\" deep-tissue bruise.

Beyond the hamstring and his current, painful back contusion, the two-time MVP has also dealt with nagging issues involving his knee, toe, and ankle throughout the campaign.\n\nThe lower-body ailments have prevented Jackson from showcasing his signature electric dual-threat ability; his rushing yardage is on pace for a career-low and he has appeared noticeably less explosive, suggesting the constant battle with injury has been a major factor in the Ravens' disappointing skid.\n\nIn his absence, Tyler Huntley would get the start\n\n*This story will be updated with the latest available information.\n\nMORE: ESPN Insider says Ravens should consider moving on from Lamar Jackson\n\nJackson sustained a deep-tissue back contusion late in the first half of the Ravens' recent loss to the New England Patriots after he was kneed in the back by a defender while going to the ground.  Harbaugh confirmed the injury is \"legitimate, very painful\" and has caused the muscles around the area to lock up, severely limiting the two-time MVP's ability to move.\n\nThe #Ravens are listing QB Lamar Jackson (back) as doubtful for Saturday night’s game vs. the Packers.\n\nTyler Huntley will start if he can’t go.

    "title": "Player grades: Thunder officially have Spurs problem after 117-102 loss",
    "description": "Player grades for the Oklahoma City Thunder's 117-102 loss to the San Antonio Spurs.",
    "fullText": "OKLAHOMA CITY — As OKC fans filed out in the final moments to save some daylight on Christmas, an assembly of San Antonio fans parked near their favorite team's bench took over. A 'Go Spurs Go!' chant could be audibly heard as the final buzzer sounded.\n\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder had their world shaken in their 117-102 loss to the San Antonio Spurs. That's three consecutive defeats handed to them by that squad in the last two weeks.\n\nPlaying on Christmas for the first time, the Thunder looked like a team ready to avenge their most embarrassing loss yet, less than 48 hours later. Jalen Williams had things going. So did Chet Holmgren. The Spurs weren't rattled, though. De'Aaron Fox kept their composure. San Antonio couldn't miss any of its looks.\n\nEventually, the Thunder were in a 41-36 deficit after the first quarter. Allowing 75% shooting, the league-best defense looked completely out of character. The Spurs had plenty of drive-first scorers who sliced through OKC's defense. Little bit of deja vu.\n\nThe scary part was, Victor Wembanyama hardly played. You know, the guy universally viewed as a top-five player who completely changes the geometry in the halfcourt? He continues to be in a bench role as he works his way back from a calf strain.\n\nThe Thunder eventually cooled off, but the Spurs didn't. Alex Caruso was dared to beat them from the outside. He missed eight outside attempts in nine minutes. They only put up 24 points in the second frame as they entered halftime in a 69-60 deficit to San Antonio.\n\nThe second half was much of the same story. Stephon Castle threw an elementary alley-oop to Luke Kornet in the early stages to push their lead to double-digit points. The Spurs had it too easy going to the paint. Harrison Barnes continues to be pesky against OKC as he sliced through their defense for an easy layup.\n\nOn the other end, the Thunder offense once again regressed. Badly. Anytime the ball was out of Gilgeous-Alexander's hands, that was a small victory. They clanked outside look after outside look. A 19-point third frame had them in a 95-79 hole.\n\nA quick start to the fourth quarter provided some hope. Isaiah Joe made an outside bucket to cut it within nine points with a little over eight minutes to go. Alas, that'd be the closest it'd get the rest of the way. Wembanyama drilled in a demoralizing outside jumper that OKC had no chance to actually contest. The rest of the Spurs also helped out with timely buckets.\n\nThe Thunder only scored 23 points in the final frame. That wasn't enough to overcome a double-digit deficit. Eventually, they waved the white flag and cleared their bench. For the first time since Game 1 of the 2025 NBA Finals, the OKC home crowd left in a bad mood.\n\nThe Thunder shot 39% from the field and went 11-of-44 (25%) from 3. They shot 17-of-25 on free throws. They had 23 assists on 37 baskets. Five Thunder players scored double-digit points.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander was limited to 22 points and six rebounds. Williams had a quiet 12 points and six assists. Holmgren tallied 10 points and 12 rebounds. Isaiah Hartenstein totaled 13 points and 12 rebounds. Caruso finished with 12 points on 13 shot attempts.\n\nMeanwhile, the Spurs shot 54% from the field and went 11-of-29 (37.9%) from 3. They shot 16-of-21 on free throws. They had 20 assists on 45 baskets. Five Spurs players scored double-digit points.\n\nWembanyama had 19 points and 11 rebounds off the bench. Fox finished with an efficient 29 points on 12-of-19 shooting and four rebounds. Castle had 18 points and seven assists. Barnes finished with 15 points and six rebounds. Dylan Harper helped with 12 points off the bench.\n\nWell, the Thunder officially have a Spurs problem. Three games in two weeks show that they're a matchup nightmare. Just by eyeballing, you can tell they're a tick faster and more athletic than OKC. That small advantage has been painfully noticeable. The defense has been beaten at all three levels. When you're this defensively reliant, you can't let that happen.\n\nA lot can happen from now to the NBA playoffs. After all, it's only December. But the Thunder have been slapped with reality for the first time in a while. Over one-third of the way through the regular season, San Antonio looks to be the first piece of Kryptonite that has risen from the field against the reigning NBA champion.\n\nLet's look at Thunder player grades:\n\nWith the final result unofficially decided, Gilgeous-Alexander's last shot attempt hit the front of the rim. A pull-up 3-pointer failed to go in despite it being a quality look, as a screen wiped out Castle. That was a pretty poetic way to end a forgettable Christmas Day debut for the reigning MVP.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander finished with 22 points on 7-of-19 shooting, six rebounds and four assists. He shot 1-of-6 from 3 and went 7-of-8 on free throws. He also had a steal.\n\nFor really the first time, the Spurs slowed down Gilgeous-Alexander's unreal superb scoring production. Usually automatic in the mid-range, San Antonio crashed down several defenders at him as soon as he pulled up. Same with his outside jumper.\n\nAs Wembanyama roamed the paint like an 'Attack on Titan' character, Gilgeous-Alexander hesitated to get to the rim. It's one thing when it's just him; it's another when the Spurs are also loaded with perimeter defenders that can keep up with his footwork. At that point, that's too many problems to solve.\n\nThe Thunder have relied on the same formula in their NBA dominance over the last two seasons — Gilgeous-Alexander constantly puts up an efficient 30-plus points while the rest of the roster shuts down the opponent on the other end. When both of those variables are off, like they were here, then this is the result.\n\nMade the space for the Step🔙\n\nVote Shai on 3x1 Vote Day 💫 https://t.co/0HE3nd0kPx pic.twitter.com/CwnJu6Tufr\n\n— OKC THUNDER (@okcthunder) December 25, 2025\n\nSteal 🤝 Score pic.twitter.com/BubxjWWXVk\n\n— OKC THUNDER (@okcthunder) December 25, 2025\n\nGoing at Kornet, Williams sped up to get by the Spurs' starting center. He lolipopped his way to an underhanded layup. That first bucket felt like we were about to see the All-NBA player wash away a forgettable outing just a couple of days ago against the same squad. Never mind about that.\n\nWilliams finished with 12 points on 5-of-13 shooting, six assists and two rebounds. He shot 1-of-2 from 3 and went 1-of-4 on free throws. He also had two steals.\n\nEarly on, Williams teased us with a vintage performance. He drove to the basket for a layup. He nailed a couple of mid-range jumpers. He even swished in a pull-up 3-pointer. Alas, his nine points in the opening frame proved to be three-fourths of his point production.\n\nAs the game progressed, Williams faded into the background as a scorer. His pull-up jumper abandoned him mid-game. The Spurs forced him to second-guess himself. By the end, he joined a long list of OKC players who looked like they forgot how to play to their formula of basketball success.\n\nWhile the offense wasn't the side of the ball to blame, the Thunder need more from Williams. It's disappointing to see him lay a second consecutive egg against the Spurs. They brought home an NBA championship because he broke out as an efficient 20-plus scorer. That version of him has yet to be seen on a consistent basis.\n\nOffense heatin' up early \n\nVote Thunder on 3x1 vote day 🌟 https://t.co/0HE3nd0kPx pic.twitter.com/RnUFXHi6Au\n\n— OKC THUNDER (@okcthunder) December 25, 2025\n\nRicocheting a free-throw attempt, Holmgren's miss had Wembanyama pumped up. ESPN's hot mics caught the latter flexing his muscles and high-fiving his teammate on the missed attempt. Once again, Holmgren was quiet with the Spurs across from him.\n\nHolmgren finished with 10 points on 5-of-9 shooting, 12 rebounds and two assists. He shot 0-of-2 from 3 and went 0-of-2 on free throws. He also had a block.\n\nFor the first time since last season, the Thunder have gone from a defensive leakage to a full-blown problem. The Spurs did much of the same two days later. They attacked OKC's defense. Armed with several players who could put the ball down and attack, they went on to have 52 points inside the paint on 59% shooting.\n\nThat's just not going to cut it. The Thunder need more from Holmgren. He's the face of their interior defense. They don't have enough offensive juice to go bucket for bucket. You can complain that the seven-footer isn't an aggressive enough scorer, but this is who he is at this point in his career.\n\nWe'll see if the Thunder can eventually figure things out. April is still a long way away from the games actually mattering. But the game tape they've put up in these two losses is downright alarming. A matchup against the Spurs has made OKC's gaudy defense look pedestrian for the first time in forever.\n\nCompletely left wide open, Caruso had several good looks from the corner. Clank. Clank. Clank. The onomatopoeia echoed throughout the OKC crowd. Hand-delivered several quality looks, OKC's role players let it slip through their fingers and bailed the Spurs out.\n\nCaruso finished with 12 points on 3-of-13 shooting and one rebound. He shot 2-of-12 from 3 and went 4-of-4 on free throws. He also had one block.\n\nThe Spurs join the long list of teams over the years that have deployed that strategy. As awesome as Caruso is on the defensive end, his inconsistent outshot shot is equally a disadvantage. That's a theme throughout the Thunder's roster. Same goes for guys like Cason Wallace and Lu Dort.\n\nThe Thunder simply don't have enough real shooters to force teams to play honestly with them in the halfcourt. They won an NBA championship in spite of it. But that was because they played all-time great defense to ugly up the game. If they're not bringing that level of defense, then they look more vulnerable.\n\nWe've known that for years, though. The Thunder consciously made that trade-off when constructing this championship roster. Any slippage on that end, though, exposes them to losses like these. It's still a long way away, but it feels like OKC will need to win close, low-scoring games once again in the playoffs.\n\nThis article originally appeared on OKC Thunder Wire: Player grades: Thunder officially have Spurs problem after 117-102 loss",

    "description": "The Broncos face the Chiefs in Kansas City on Christmas. We break down what the game means for the NFL playoff picture in Week 17.",
    "fullText": "When the NFL schedule makers sat down to craft the Christmas slate of games, they likely envisioned the clash between the Denver Broncos and Kansas City Chiefs as a battle for the AFC West title.\n\nWhile the Chiefs have already been eliminated from playoff contention, the Broncos can wrap up their first AFC West title since 2015 with a win tonight, and a little bit of help from the Houston Texans on Saturday. In addition, Denver can also secure the No. 1 seed in the AFC, but they will need a little more help here in Week 17 to clinch the top seed.\n\nLet’s start with the AFC West title. Denver can clinch the division title this week, officially bringing to an end the Chiefs’ reign atop the division. With a win over the Chiefs on Christmas night, and a Los Angeles Chargers loss or tie against the Houston Texans on Saturday, the Broncos are AFC West champions.\n\nDenver can also clinch the AFC West with a tie against the Chiefs, provided the Chargers lose to the Texans.\n\nIn addition, Denver can also wrap up the No. 1 seed in the AFC this week, and the lone bye week in the AFC playoffs.\n\nBut they would need a lot of help to get that done.\n\nFirst, the Broncos would need to win against the Chiefs on Thursday night. Then, the Broncos would need the New England Patriots to lose to the New York Jets, the Chargers to lose or tie against the Texans, the Jacksonville Jaguars to lose or tie against the Indianapolis Colts, and the Buffalo Bills to lose or tie against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nWith the Chiefs already eliminated from the playoffs, this game will not have any tiebreaker implications for the Chiefs and Broncos directly.\n\nBut it could play a role for the Broncos when it comes to seeding, in a very narrow scenario.\n\nLooking at the AFC West, the Broncos lead the division with a 12-3 record, while the Chargers are in second place with an 11-4 record. If Denver beats the Chiefs and the Chargers beat the Texans on Saturday, the two teams will meet in Week 18 with the division title up for grabs.\n\nWhy? Because the Chargers against Denver earlier this season, and another win in Week 18 in this scenario, would see the two teams finish at 13-4. The first tiebreaker in a division is head-to-head record, which woudl give the Chargers the AFC West title.\n\nThen the Broncos would be seeded somewhere from No. 5 to No. 7, depending on how the Bills finish, who could also end the year with a 13-4 record. If, again in this scenario, the Bills finish with the same 13-4 record as Denver, the tiebreaker will be conference record. Right now, Buffalo is at 8-3, and they have one AFC game remaining so they would finish at 9-3 in this scenario.\n\nDenver right now has a 7-3 record in AFC games, and would finish at 8-4 in this scenario, dropping them behind the Bills.\n\nAgain, this is a very specific hypothetical, but this game could matter in a tiebreaker scenario.",

    "fullText": "The New York Mets have some work to do to replace star slugging first baseman Pete Alonso’s production after he signed a five-year contract with the Baltimore Orioles.\n\nWith the offseason focus being run prevention, the team has opted to risk offense for better defense, hence why Alonso wasn’t even given an offer by New York. The Mets have brought in several players who are known for their defense and got rid of several players who aren’t known for their defensive prowess.\n\nImproving the defense and pitching staff is always good, but Mets brass might not understand just how much Alonso did for this offense. He averaged 42 home runs and 114 RBI and is extremely durable. He is the franchise leader in home runs with 264.\n\nInfielder Jorge Polanco was signed to a two-year, $40 million contract and the expectation is that he will split time between first base and designated hitter. Polanco is a fine player and a solid defender, however, he’s played one inning of one game at first base in his whole career.\n\nReports suggest that the Seattle Mariners were prepping Polanco for a move to first base but never made the switch because there was nobody to replace Polanco at second base. Third baseman Mark Vientos is the other player who is projected to see time at first base, but there is a premier Japanese slugger who is a versatile corner infield/outfielder that would be a perfect fit for the Mets.\n\nProlific home run hitter Kazuma Okamoto was posted to Major League Baseball free agency by the Yomiuri Giants of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) on Nov. 20 and has until Jan. 4, 2026 to sign with an MLB team. MLB.com’s Mark Feinsand named the Mets a potential fit to land the 29-year-old superstar.\n\n“A decorated slugger in Japan, Okamoto will be posted by the Yomiuri Giants this winter, making him available to big league clubs,” Feinsand wrote Tuesday. “Okamoto, who became a full-time player with the Giants in 2018, is a six-time NPB All-Star who has won three home run titles, though there will be questions about his ability to hit higher-velocity pitchers in the Majors. The 29-year-old has 248 career home runs in 1,074 games with Yomiuri, including six consecutive 30-homer campaigns between 2018-23. Okamoto has played more third base than first in Japan, though it’s unclear how Major League teams will view him at the hot corner.”\n\nOkamoto’s versatility would allow for the Mets to play him, Polanco and Vientos at the same time in different ways depending on matchups. If the rumored projected contract for Okamoto is accurate (four-year, $64 million), the Mets have plenty of funds to get a deal done if there is mutual interest.",

    "fullText": "The Washington Commanders fell to 4-12 on the season, losing to the Dallas Cowboys 30-23 on Christmas Day in the home finale at Northwest Stadium.\n\nIt was an ugly start for the Commanders, allowing Dallas to score on all four of its first-half possessions. Rookie running back Jacory Croskey-Merritt did his part to keep the Commanders in the game, rushing for 105 yards on 11 carries and scoring two touchdowns, including a 72-yard run in the third quarter.\n\nWith Jayden Daniels and Marcus Mariota both out, veteran quarterback Josh Johnson made his first NFL start since 2021, completing 15 of 23 passes for 198 yards. Johnson played as well as can be expected, only putting the ball in harm's way one time. He did not turn the ball over. The problem for the Commanders was that they only ran 41 offensive plays, compared to 87 for the Cowboys.\n\nSo, which players shined in defeat for Washington? Who struggled? Let's look at the Week 17 edition of studs and duds.\n\nBill didn't have a lot of touches, again, Washington had only 41 offensive plays, but he made them count. Croskey-Merritt had a two-touchdown day, with his first touchdown run an impressive 10-yarder, in which he made some moves at the line of scrimmage. He could have had a third touchdown run, but lost his footing inside the 10-yard line. Croskey-Merritt now has 776 rushing yards and eight touchdowns, averaging 4.8 yards per carry. And he has done it with limited opportunities. That's not bad for a seventh-round pick.\n\nBILL TAKES IT 72 YARDS TO THE HOUSE\n\nDALvsWAS on @Netflix pic.twitter.com/5I9On67tbI\n\nIt's been an up-and-down year for the second-year cornerback. While Sainristil did break up a potential touchdown pass in the end zone, he gave up several catches and missed some key tackles.\n\nSainristil having a HORRIBLE game. Here is misses a tackle pic.twitter.com/CqjRl4uJX2\n\n— Mark Tyler (Hogs Haven) (@Tiller56) December 25, 2025\n\nOn Washington's first drive, Deebo Samuel had a 41-yard catch-and-run where he trucked over Dallas safety Donovan Wilson. Samuel had another 27-yard reception, where he stiff-armed Cowboys cornerback Trevon Diggs to the ground. Samuel finished with 68 receiving yards and 25 rushing yards on only four touches. Samuel's performance against the Cowboys is exactly what Washington envisioned when trading for him last offseason. Samuel has had a good season, but has had to play more of a traditional receiver role for much of the year due to the Commanders' injuries at receiver. An impactful day for Deebo.\n\nOH MY, DEEBO.\n\nDALvsWAS on @Netflix pic.twitter.com/kUXeh1JJbJ\n\nRemember how linebacker Frankie Luvu was supposed to be even better in his second season for the Commanders? That feels like years ago. Luvu was so good in his first year in Washington that he was named second-team All-Pro. He was expected to have an even bigger year in 2025, especially rushing the passer. That never happened. Luvu's numbers across the board are down; he has only three sacks and missed tackles have been a recurring issue. In this game, Von Miller sacked Dak Prescott on a third-and-9, which would have forced the Cowboys to either punt or attempt a long field goal. Instead, Luvu was flagged, the Cowboys had an automatic first down and eventually kicked a field goal. That made it 27-17.\n\nIt was a career day for the second-year defensive tackle. With Daron Payne out, Newton took advantage of his opportunity, finishing with nine tackles, including two for loss, three sacks and five quarterback hits. Newton was an active presence all game and clearly Washington's most impactful pass rusher. This is the type of performance the Commanders have been waiting on from Newton and the hope is he can finish strong next week against the Eagles.\n\nNewton with his 2nd sack of the game pic.twitter.com/qdcl3Q1Rkn\n\n— Mark Tyler (Hogs Haven) (@Tiller56) December 25, 2025\n\nFor as much as we have blasted Washington's pass defense, the Cowboys rushed for 211 yards, averaging 4.8 yards per carry. Dallas was picking up big yardage on simple draw plays. On one third-and-8, fullback Hunter Luepke took the handoff from Prescott and picked up the eight yards needed for the first down. It was one of a series of embarrassing plays from Washington's defense. The run defense was better in the second half, but that's a low bar. Overall, it was a pathetic effort.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: Studs and duds from Christmas loss to Cowboys",

Let's meet the Chiefs' starting quarterback replacing Mahomes and Minshew.\n\nOladokun played six seasons of college football from 2016 to 2021, including three at South Florida, two at Samford, and one at South Dakota State. Though he received eight starts with Samford in 2019, his lone season as a full-time starter came in 2021, his final year in college, with South Dakota State.\n\nDuring the 2021 campaign with the Jackrabbits, Oladokun tossed 25 touchdowns to just seven interceptions, leading South Dakota State to an 11-4 record.\n\nAfter a successful season with the Jackrabbits, Oladokun headed to the NFL, where he was a seventh-round pick in the 2022 NFL Draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was released by Pittsburgh during final cuts and found a home in Kansas City afterwards.\n\nOladokun has been with the Chiefs since, winning two Super Bowls on the practice squad. He made his first NFL appearance against the Broncos in 2024, but his true debut came in Week 16 of the 2025 campaign versus the Titans.\n\nIn Tennessee last week, Oladokun completed 11 of 16 passes for 116 yards in Kansas City's blowout loss.

    "fullText": "Spurs record vs. Thunder: San Antonio extends winning streak over OKC with blowout victory on Christmas Day originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nLed by Victor Wembanyama, the Spurs have embraced the challenge of facing off against the league's best side -- the Thunder -- in 2025.\n\nThe reigning champions have proven a tough out for the league's other 28 teams, downing all but two of their opponents across 28 non-San Antonio opponents.\n\nBut against Wembanyama and San Antonio, that record looks far more wretched. Oklahoma City is yet to claim a win over the Spurs in three appearances. And with back-to-back blowout wins against their fearsome foes, San Antonio doesn't look intimidated by all the Thunder have accomplished so far.\n\nWith that, here's what you need to know about the Spurs' record vs. Oklahoma City this season.\n\nMORE: Victor Wembanyama-Thunder beef, explained\n\nWith its win on Christmas, San Antonio moved to 3-0 against the Thunder this season. That mark grows more impressive when you consider that the defending NBA champions have a 26-2 record against all other foes.\n\nThe Spurs outgunned their highly-touted opposition, sinking 45-of-84 field goal attempts (53.5%) en route to a 15-point win.\n\nWembanyama shimmered as he usually does, producing 19 points, 11 rebounds, three steals and one block in 26 minutes of action. His impact stretched beyond the stat sheet; his harrowing length and timing deterred Oklahoma City from attacking the rim. All of that is to say that San Antonio's supernova made a marked impact on proceedings from the bench.\n\nMORE: Inside Spurs center Luke Kornet's evolution\n\nHe wasn't alone in anchoring the Spurs' impressive showcase. De'Aaron Fox scored 21 of his 29 points in the first half, finding his rhythm while matched up against the Thunder's best perimeter defenders. Rookie Dylan Harper also showed flashes of brilliance, tallying a loud 12 points that was punctuated by a wondrous two-handed dunk through traffic.\n\nHAVE YOURSELF A MERRY CHRISTMAS, DYLAN HARPER 😤 pic.twitter.com/LtZHTnZlmX\n\n— SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) December 25, 2025\n\nThe Thunder's attack was left sputtering amid an onslaught of Spurs defenders. They hit just 38.9% of their shots and 25% of their threes on Thursday afternoon. Oklahoma City's 102 points is its second-lowest tally this season.\n\nWhat's the reason for San Antonio's success over their rival? It's anyone's guess, really. Wembanyama's defensive gravity keeps even the best attacking players on their toes. The Spurs also have an assortment of ball-handlers capable of fending off OKC's finest defenders. Regardless of the reason for their success, it's clear that there isn't a side better-equipped at handling the Thunder than San Antonio.\n\nWe'll see if they can maintain that level of display against Oklahoma City going forward.\n\nMORE: Which teams could trade for Giannis Antetokounmpo",

Any time you set history it is always interesting to point out.\n\nYou may have missed the “history” as it was not obvious to the naked eye, even if it was technically seen by it. The Cowboys’ history made on Christmas was by way of their uniform combination as they wore (from top to bottom) their white helmets, navy jerseys, and white pants. Basically this was their old school “color rush” uniform with the navy jersey as the middle portion.\n\nThis is a combination that Dallas had never worn as noted. We have seen them use the helmet and pants before or helmet and jersey even, but either the silver helmet or pants were a part of those particular ensembles when they were trotted out before.\n\nRecent history has seen the Cowboys wear their navy uniforms more often and even do so at home which was previously something they never ever did. Consider that they wore navy at home last week in their AT&T Stadium finale.\n\nWe will see what else they come up with in the future.",

    "fullText": "LSU Tigers star safety AJ Haulcy is ending his college football career as he declares for the NFL draft, per Hayes Fawcett of On3Sports.\n\nLike teammate Mansoor Delane, Haulcy transferred to the Tigers this past season with hopes of getting more eyes on him and building up his draft stock. Both players succeeded in big ways.\n\nHaulcy led LSU in tackles this past season with 88. He also added three interceptions, four passes broken up, and a forced fumble. He held his own in coverage and was a thumper in the run game. There's nothing else the Tigers could have asked him to do.\n\nThere was a four-week stretch where he finished with at least 12 tackles in each game. It felt like he was involved in every play that went into the box. His best individual game was in the losing effort against the Texas A&M Aggies, when he had 12 tackles with an interception and a pass break up.\n\nThe Texas native is a major college football success story. He came out of high school as a three-star recruit. 247Sports had him ranked as the 150th best safety in that class and the 266th best player in his home state.\n\nHe was viewed with more respect as a transfer, but he still ended up outplaying those expectations. He was the 151st player in the portal and the third-ranked safety. Now, he's going to be one of the first safeties taken in the NFL draft, receiving some second-round evaluations.\n\nHaulcy now becomes the third player from this Tigers team to declare for the draft, joining Delane and Aaron Anderson.",

    "fullText": "Chiefs vs. Broncos live score, updates, highlights from 2025 NFL Christmas game originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhere to watch Chiefs vs. Broncos\n\nThe NFL on Christmas Day delivers an AFC West rivalry matchup unlike any seen in the last decade, as the Denver Broncos (12-3) travel to Kansas City to take on the Chiefs (6-9) at Arrowhead Stadium.\n\nIn a stunning reversal of roles, the Broncos enter as the dominant force, aiming to secure the AFC West title and remain firmly in the driver's seat for the conference's crucial No. 1 overall seed and the coveted first-round bye. With the Los Angeles Chargers breathing down their necks, a victory over the crippled Chiefs would officially clinch the AFC West for Denver, ending Kansas City's unprecedented nine-year reign as division champions and marking this holiday game as perhaps the most significant in Denver's last ten years.\n\nFor the three-time defending AFC Champion Chiefs, this prime-time holiday slot is a bittersweet stage for an unfamiliar role. Having already been officially eliminated from playoff contention for the first time in the Patrick Mahomes era, the Chiefs have seen their season completely unravel, suffering a losing record for the first time since 2012. The franchise is currently battling devastating injuries, with Mahomes and his backup Gardner Minshew both sidelined by ACL injuries, leaving the offense to be managed by third-string quarterback Chris Oladokun. The team that was once the gatekeeper of the AFC has become a hollow shell of its dynasty self.\n\nThe stark contrast in stakes presents a unique challenge to the streaking Broncos, who must overcome a late-season loss to the Jaguars that snapped their 11-game winning streak. Head Coach Sean Payton is stressing focus, emphasizing that despite the Chiefs' struggles, a division title and the No. 1 seed are still their stated goals. A win in Kansas City, where the Broncos have historically struggled, would not only solidify their resurgence but would also serve as the ceremonial passing of the torch, ushering in a new era of dominance in the AFC West.\n\nThis Christmas night contest marks a seismic shift in the AFC power structure. What was once the annual, late-season coronation of the Chiefs is now the potential crowning moment for the Broncos — a team ready to reclaim the top spot in the AFC West and send a clear message to the rest of the conference.\n\nThe Sporting News is tracking live scoring updates and highlights for Chiefs vs. Broncos on Christmas.

    "fullText": "Over the last couple of months, PSG have been linked to Newcastle United standout Sandro Tonali. Nonetheless, no serious move has materialized so far, but rumors of the Parisians’ interest in the Italian emerge every few months.\n\nAccording to a previous report from Fichajes, PSG could already have their sights set on Tonali as they aim to strengthen their midfield and build on a historic campaign from last season.\n\nMoreover, this update follows a report from TuttoJuve claiming that both Juventus and PSG are preparing bids for Tonali. According to the outlet, the French side remain intent on pursuing the midfielder and are unwilling to step aside, even as Juventus push to land him.\n\nDespite interest from clubs, Newcastle have no interest in selling the midfielder. Nonetheless, there’s only one scenario in which the player could ever leave the Magpies.\n\nTonali is Juventus’ dream signing, as reported by Gazzetta dello Sport, although it would take a transfer request from the 25-year-old and a suitable offer for the Magpies to let him leave.\n\nThe Bianconeri could aim for an initial loan with an obligation to sign permanently, contingent on them qualifying for the Champions League. They could also look to include striker Jonathan David in a deal if Newcastle are open to that possibility.\n\nAmidst reports concerning Tonali’s future, Italian journalist Gianluca Di Marzio shared his assessment of what the player wants to do, but whether that will be the outcome remains to be seen.\n\n“In his heart, Sandro Tonali still dreams of returning to AC Milan,” Di Marzio said. “He left against his will. It was a decision made by the club, and he didn’t feel he could say no when Newcastle’s offer arrived. He doesn’t want to return to Italy, he wants to return to Milan.”",

    "fullText": "The 2026 NFL Playoffs get started on Saturday, January 10 with four teams kicking off the Wild Card round. The playoff field will feature 14 teams with 12 of them playing that first weekend and the No. 1 seed in each conference getting a bye to the Divisional Round. This year, the opening round features two games on Saturday, three games on Sunday, and one game on Monday.\n\nEight teams will face off in the Divisional round, with that weekend featuring two games on Saturday the 17th and two games on Sunday the 18th. The Conference Championship round follows with the final four teams facing off on Sunday the 25th. The final two teams square off in Santa Clara, California at Super Bowl 60 on Sunday, February 8, 2026.\n\nThe field is slowly filling up as teams punch their ticket for the 2026 NFL Playoffs. Below is each team that has clinched a playoff berth.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Green Bay Packers (34-26) to improve to 12-2.\n\nThe Broncos have not won a lot of pretty games this season, but they keep on chugging along. Bo Nix has made plays when they’ve mattered most and the Broncos have emerged as arguably the best team in the AFC. They clinched their playoff berth with a comeback win over the Packers and moved a game up on the Patriots for the No. 1 seed. They remain two games up on the Chargers and can clinch the AFC West title and the No. 1 seed with a win and some help in Week 16.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Detroit Lions (41-34) to improve to 11-3\n\nWeek 16 update: The Rams lost to the Seahawks in overtime on Thursday Night Football to drop to second place in the NFC West, pending the outcome of 49ers-Colts on Monday. LA is now 11-4.\n\nThe Rams are playing as well as anybody right now and are headed back to the playoffs. They fell behind by ten points against Detroit, but a big third quarter got them back and they controlled things in the fourth quarter. They are tied with the Seahawks atop the NFC West, but hold the tiebreaker edge for the time-being due to their first head-to-head win over Seattle back in Week 11. The two squads face off in Week 16 with first place in the division and the No. 1 seed in the NFC on the line.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Seahawks (38-37) to improve to 12-3\n\nThe Seahawks won a wild overtime thriller over the Rams to clinch a playoff berth. More importantly than securing a playoff berth, the Seahawks moved into first place in the NFC West and took over the No. 1 seed in the conference. They’ve won five straight and close out the season one the road against the Panthers and 49ers. The division title will likely go down to the wire in Week 18.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Washington Commanders (29-18) to improve to 10-5.\n\nThe Eagles have struggled in recent weeks after a 4-0 start, but they are headed back to the playoffs. They rolled over the Commanders in the second half to clinch the NFC East title. It was their second straight win after losing three straight to the Cowboys, Bears, and Chargers. They will head into Week 17 sitting a game back of the Bears for the No. 2 seed and two back of the Seahawks for the No. 1 seed.\n\nHow they clinched: Detroit Lions loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers (29-24)\n\nThe 49ers still have to play on Monday Night Football, but they got good news on Sunday with the Lions loss to the Steelers. San Francisco still has a chance at the NFC West title and the No. 1 seed in the conference, but they at least know they are officially headed back to the playoffs. They host the Bears in Week 17 and finish the season against at home against the Seahawks.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Green Bay Packers (22-16) to improve to 11-4, coupled with the Detroit Lions losing to the Pittsburgh Steelers (29-24)\n\nChicago has bigger things in mind, but they at least know they’ll be playing in the postseason. The Bears win the Packers firmed up their lead in the NFC North, and they now have a division-clinching scenario in Week 17. The Bears travel to face the 49ers next week and close out the season at home against the Lions.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Baltimore Ravens (28-24) to improve to 12-3\n\nThe Patriots held off Derrick Henry and the Ravens to punch their ticket to the 2026 NFL Playoffs. They remain a game up on the Bills in the AFC East and can clinch the division title next week with a win and a Bills loss. They also moved into a tie with the Broncos for the No. 1 seed in the AFC. Denver has the tiebreaker heading into Week 17 based on the common games tiebreaker.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Denver Broncos (34-20) coupled with Colts loss to 49ers (48-27)\n\nThe Jaguars are headed back to the playoffs for the first time in three years. They clinched a wild card berth, but will be more focused on the division title. They head into week 17 with an 11-4 record and a one-game lead on the Texans for the division title. They sit in third place in the overall NFC standings and are a game back of the Patriots and Broncos for the top two seeds.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Cleveland Browns (23-20) coupled with Colts loss to 49ers (48-27)\n\nThe Bills punched their ticket, but the division title is still a possibility. The Patriots lost in Week 16, and the Bills win moved them to only a game back in the division. Buffalo is currently the sixth seed and is riding a four-game win streak as they head toward the playoffs.\n\nHow they clinched: Win over Dallas Cowboys (34-17) coupled with Colts loss to 49ers (48-27)\n\nThe Chargers are headed back to the playoffs for a second straight season. They are guaranteed a spot, but still have a shot at the AFC West title. The Broncos loss in Week 16 allowed the Chargers to cut the division lead to one game with two weeks remaining. The Chargers and Broncos face off in Denver in Week 18, so if both teams win in Week 17, that game will be for the division title, and maybe the No. 1 seed.\n\nHow they clinched: Detroit Lions loss to the Minnesota Vikings (23-10)\n\nThe Packers had two clinching scenarios, one if they won or tied their game against the Ravens on Saturday of Week 17, and one if the Lions lost or tied their game against the Vikings. Detroit ended up losing and Green Bay punched their ticket. The Packers are effectively two games back of the Bears in the NFC North, but they still have a chance at the division title if they can win out and the Bears lose out.",

    "description": "Week 17 will go down as a win for the Cowboys but there are other numbers that tell the real story of what happened against Washington.",
    "fullText": "The Dallas Cowboys’ Week 17 win over the rival Washington Commanders won’t be remembered for much. Both teams entered the Christmas Day affair firmly eliminated from playoff contention and both teams showed exactly why they are categorized as pretenders rather than contenders.\n\nDespite claiming the 30-23 win, the day rang hollow for Dallas. Not since Clark W. Griswald was enrolled in the Jelly of the Month club has such a disappointing gift been bestowed. The Cowboys moved to 7-8-1 with a chance to avoid a losing season next week, but the game was against a third-string quarterback and took until the final minute to seal the deal. The win was big for the culture but wasn't, by any means, uplifting.\n\nUnlike most weeks, it wasn’t about the final score or the win-loss record. Those numbers pale in comparison to a few other telling numbers. At the end of the day it’s all about 87, 38, and 6. An explanation:\n\n87 offensive plays is a ridiculously high number of plays for an offense to post in an overtime game, let alone a game played entirely in regulation. Compared to the Commanders' 41 plays, it signaled total dominance on the afternoon. Combined with the 152-yard delta in offensive yards gained, it showed Dak Prescott and company were clearly in control. Considering there were zero Cowboys’ turnovers, it’s hard to believe Dallas only won by seven points.\n\nIf this proves anything it’s that it takes more than a dominant offense to safely win in today’s NFL. The Cowboys’ break-but-don’t bend defense (you read that correctly) has given up points in droves this season and far too often rewarded touchdowns on red zone appearances. No yards were wasted for Washington.\n\nThe Cowboys' 87 plays are the third-most in an NFL game this season, per TruMedia.\n\n— Nicki Jhabvala (@NickiJhabvala) December 25, 2025\n\nTime of possession is one of the more overrated stats in the NFL, yet it does shed light on the current state of affairs in Dallas. In this case it speaks to the Cowboys' balance and efficiency on offense. It also exposes their second-half struggles where they only managed six total points which comes on the heels of a Week 16 game where Dallas scored zero points in the second half against the Chargers.\n\nIt's a one-score game with 16 seconds left in the third quarter. Cowboys, 27-20. Cowboys have not scored a second-half touchdown since the fourth quarter of the Detroit game. It's up to 14 possessions without a second half TD (2 vs. Lions, 5 vs Minn, 5 vs. Chargers, 2 vs. Wash)\n\n— Todd Archer (@toddarcher) December 25, 2025\n\nThe Cowboys' offense has proved their worth in efficiency but haven’t been opportunistic enough to turn all those yards into points. With so many plays and so much ball control, one would expect the Cowboys to strike gold more often than they did. Much like Buzz McCallister’s life savings, it was there for the taking, the Cowboys just couldn’t scale the bookshelf well enough to secure the lunchbox.\n\nDak Prescott was under constant assault in Week 17, falling six times for 38 yards to sacks. A case could be made three of the six sacks are on Prescott himself, but the situation highlights the pass protection limits this offense has had in 2025.\n\nThe need to fix the pass protection on the offensive line is real and has to be a priority this coming offseason.\n\nYou can follow Reid on X @ReidDHanson and be sure to follow Cowboys Wire on Facebook to join in on the conversation with fellow fans!\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cowboys Wire: By The Numbers: Cowboys win 30-23, but 87, 38 and 6 tell the story",

    "description": "The Lions face the Vikings in Minneapolis on Christmas Day. We break down what the game means for the NFL playoff picture in Week 17.",
    "fullText": "Game result: The Lions are officially done for the season. They have one more game, but they will not be headed to the playoffs. They committed six turnovers, including five by quarterback Jared Goff in a 23-10 loss to the Vikings. The Lions defense kept the team in it, holding the Vikings to only two touchdowns in spite of all the turnovers, but Detroit’s offense could get nothing done.\n\nThe Lions loss also helped the Packers punch their playoff ticket. Green Bay could have clinched their own spot with a win on Saturday over the Ravens, but now they head into that game looking to gain ground on the Bears in the NFC North.\n\nThe Detroit Lions sit on the verge of playoff elimination and need help the final two weeks of the 2025-26 NFL regular season. They can help themselves to start when they face the Minnesota Vikings on Christmas Day. The game kicks off at 4:30 p.m. ET and Detroit is a 5.5-point road favorite.\n\nThis is the second matchup of the season between these two teams. The Vikings won 27-24 in the first game in Detroit. J.J. McCarthy made his return from a high ankle sprain to throw for two touchdowns. The team added 142 rushing yards and held the Lions ground game to just 65 in the win. McCarthy will not play in this game due to a fracture in his throwing hand. Max Brosmer will get the start in his place.\n\nThe Lions had a chance to climb back into the mix last week, but a loss to the Steelers cost them. They have no control over their destiny and could be eliminated regardless of their outcome this week. The Lions are eliminated from playoff contention with a loss to the Vikings or if the Packers win or tie against the Ravens on Saturday. Green Bay is a 2.5-point favorite at home in that game.\n\nEven if the Lions win and the Packers lose, they would still need to win in Week 18 at the Bears and have the Packers lose on the road to the Vikings. It’s possible this could happen, but the odds are not great.\n\nUsing The Athletic playoff simulator, the Lions currently have a 4% chance of making the playoffs. If they beat the Vikings and the Packers lose to the Ravens, their chances increase to 14%.\n\nTiebreakers don’t matter in this situation due to the Packers having a tie on their record. Green Bay has the head-to-head tiebreaker over Detroit, but if the Lions tie the Vikings or Bears to close they season, they are eliminated from playoff contention.",

    "description": "There’s never been just one way to buy software. In ye olden times, if you liked some shareware, you’d mail off a cheque, or call up a hot-line, to get the full version. Later on, you could walk into a store and walk out with a shiny box, manuals, and disks.",
    "fullText": "There’s never been just one way to buy software. In ye olden times, if you liked some shareware, you’d mail off a cheque, or call up a hot-line, to get the full version. Later on, you could walk into a store and walk out with a shiny box, manuals, and disks.\n\nThese were some expensive boxes:\n\nNo one technically had to upgrade, but in a year or so, everybody did, because we wanted those sweet quality-of-life improvements, nicer design, and exciting new features. But eventually every product being continually developed will become good enough for its target market.\n\nWhen that happens, companies (especially the VC-backed kind) now need to contrive new and increasingly stick-like reasons for customers to pay again. From made-for-marketing ‘features’ that suck to use IRL, to breaking compatibility with older versions, to spamming you with marketing notifications and embedded ads. Their relationship with customers goes from symbiotic to parasitic.\n\nOn the other hand, the pursuit of completeness should be an ideal fit for subscription software because, theoretically, steady monthly payments from long-time customers incentivizes stability, polish, and helpful improvements.\n\nSubscriptions are particularly helpful for businesses:\n\nEspecially for solo creators, just knowing that you have ~$3000/mo coming in every month is way less anxiety-inducing than making $6,000 in a good month – but knowing that next month you could just as likely make $1000, or maybe even $0. It’s like being a farmer, surviving at the mercy of good weather.\n\nThere’s also a third reason: Tier or usage-based pricing prevents customers costing more money than they contribute. But unless you’re burning unlimited money generating LLM tokens, the risk of losing money on a web app customer is either basically zero, or very easy to predict otherwise (even over the long-term).\n\nOn paper, subscriptions could be a win-win. But some people, including many readers of this blog, have good reasons to be wary of them.\n\nKinopio subscriptions can be easily cancelled, pricing is grandfathered, receipts are emailed, accidental renewals can be refunded, and there are no cancellation fees or deceptive dark patterns. Many indie subscription apps also offer subscriptions in good faith.\n\nBut a business model that’s regularly exploited by well-known corporations, like the New York Times and Adobe, poisons the well for everyone else. Every time someone gets tricked into signing up for a non-refundable yearly subscription instead of a monthly one, or has to call to cancel a subscription they created online, those bad feelings become associated with all subscriptions.\n\nIt’s hard to have good long-lasting relationships with customers if they’re expecting the worst.\n\nThat being said, I still think subscriptions make sense to offer.\n\nFor most people, subscriptions are as normal as the old boxed software model used to be. And the much lower-cost to entry can be very helpful – especially in competitive markets where customers have a lot of options.\n\nThe onus is on companies selling subscriptions to earn trust by being transparent about who they are, what they believe, and how they’re funded (i.e. what their long-term incentives are). A public roadmap and changelog also go a long-way towards proving they practice what they preach.\n\nEven to non-technical people, paying for subscriptions makes intuitive sense when the product requires a server for helpful things like file uploads, public URLs, and real-time collaboration. But the per-user-cost of running a production CRUD server is basically zero. Counter-intuitively, what you’re really paying for is the considerable effort and expertise that it takes to keep full-featured software running reliably and continuously-improving.\n\nThat’s part of the reason why I increased prices over the years as the app grew in capability and complexity.\n\nFor context, here’s Kinopio’s pricing history:\n\nWhen I introduced paid upgrades to Kinopio in 2020, I did it as a monthly subscription because that seemed like the safe, default model for an app that needed a server.\n\nIn all my previous jobs, there was always a dedicated back-end or sysadmin team that abstracted the server hosting details from the rest of the company. They used complicated sounding terms like load balancing, replica shards, containers, observability, were woken up by pagerDuty, and were eternally worried about scaling.\n\nBut when I dived into that world, I learned that most of the jargon really didn’t matter. The kinopio-server is a simple node.js app with a pretty straightforward MVC architecture. My insecurity about keeping servers up is a big reason behind why the app works offline, or if the server is down. What developers would call local-first today.\n\nIn 2019, I wrote about my early Plans for Kinopio. Where I mentioned that,\n\n“Kinopio consists of two codebases, the client-app that runs when in the browser and the server-app which enables sharing and collaboration. The client is like a cockroach, its tiny, basically free to host, and doesn’t depend on a connection to the server. So if I can’t afford to run the Kinopio server anymore, I can just switch it off and you can continue to use Kinopio as you do now – with all your data intact.”\n\nTwo years later, I introduced the lifetime plan mainly because people kept asking me for a subscription alternative. I’m sure many of them would have still have paid for a subscription, but how long would a rueful customer stay? Would they always be looking for alternatives? Would they still enthusiastically share spaces and recommend the app to their friends and teams?\n\nMy business ‘strategy’ is that a happy customer is better than an unhappy one, and that I’d rather have some money from a user than none. (Relatedly, that’s also why Kinopio offers student/financial needs discounts).\n\nThe lifetime plan is priced at ~3× the yearly price because that was the average churn length at the time. But I think that in general, 3-4 years is a good starting point if you get a nice sounding number that is high enough so that only <10% of new customers choose it, while stilling feeling anchored to the subscription prices.\n\nSoftware designers and engineers regularly build products with original ideas, and choose to make their own jobs harder by increasing code complexity, so that their users can have an inviting, easier-to-use, and lower-friction, time using it.\n\nBut on the financial-side, web-based software companies tend to be really conservative with their business models and choose subscription-only models by default. It’s never even questioned, but I think it should be. Just like with dev work, pricing models can also take on behind-the-scenes complexity to give users a better experience.\n\nLow-variability/high-tail income (subscription MRR) is easiest to plan for, but high-variability/short-tail income (lifetime purchases) is peaky and harder to plan for – but they can work together. If you position and price it right, the ideal customers for lifetime pricing will be very different than the ideal subscription customers.\n\nIt may sound counter-intuitive to give your most passionate users a pathway to never have to pay you again, but especially early on, evangelism is worth more than money. There are plenty of fish in the sea: people who have yet to find, or be recommended, Kinopio and become future customers.",

    "description": "MIT researchers developed a method that converts a user’s design into a flat series of interconnected tiles that can be converted to a 3D structure with one pull of a single string.",
    "fullText": "MIT researchers have developed a new method for designing 3D structures that can be transformed from a flat configuration into their curved, fully formed shape with only a single pull of a string.\n\nThis technique could enable the rapid deployment of a temporary field hospital at the site of a disaster such as a devastating tsunami — a situation where quick medical action is essential to save lives.\n\nThe researchers’ approach converts a user-specified 3D structure into a flat shape composed of interconnected tiles. The algorithm uses a two-step method to find the path with minimal friction for a string that can be tightened to smoothly actuate the structure.\n\nThe actuation mechanism is easily reversible, and if the string is released, the structure quickly returns to its flat configuration. This could enable complex, 3D structures to be stored and transported more efficiently and with less cost.\n\nIn addition, the designs generated by their system are agnostic to the fabrication method, so complete structures can be produced using 3D printing, CNC milling, molding, or other techniques.\n\nThis method could enable the creation of transportable medical devices, foldable robots that can flatten to enter hard-to-reach spaces, or even modular space habitats that can be actuated by robots working on the surface of Mars.\n\n“The simplicity of the whole actuation mechanism is a real benefit of our approach. The user just needs to provide their intended design, and then our method optimizes it in such a way that it holds the shape after just one pull on the string, so the structure can be deployed very easily. I hope people will be able to use this method to create a wide variety of different, deployable structures,” says Akib Zaman, an electrical engineering and computer science (EECS) graduate student and lead author of a paper on this new method.\n\nHe is joined on the paper by MIT graduate student Jacqueline Aslarus; postdoc Jiaji Li; Associate Professor Stefanie Mueller, leader of the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Engineering Group in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL); and senior author Mina Konaković Luković, an assistant professor and leader of the Algorithmic Design Group in CSAIL. The research was presented at the Association for Computing Machinery’s SIGGRAPH Conference and Exhibition on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques in Asia.\n\nFrom ancient art to an algorithm\n\nCreating deployable structures from flat pieces simplifies on-site assembly and could be especially useful in constructing emergency shelters after natural disasters. On a smaller scale, items like foldable bike helmets could improve the safety of riders who would otherwise be unable to carry a bulky helmet.\n\nBut converting flat, deployable objects into their 3D shape often requires specialized equipment or multiple steps, and the actuation mechanism is typically difficult to reverse.\n\n“Because of these challenges, deployable structures tend to be manually designed and quite simple, geometrically. But if we can create more complex geometries, while simplifying the actuation mechanism, we could enhance the capabilities of these deployables,” Zaman says.\n\nTo do this, the researchers created a method that automatically converts a user’s 3D design into a flat structure comprised of tiles, connected by rotating hinges at the corners, which can be fully actuated by pulling a single string one time.\n\nTheir method breaks a user design into a grid of quadrilateral tiles inspired by kirigami, the ancient Japanese art of paper cutting. With kirigami, by cutting a material in certain ways, they can encode it with unique properties. In this case, they use kirigami to create an auxetic mechanism, which is a structure that gets thicker when stretched and thinner when compressed.\n\nAfter encoding the 3D geometry into a flat set of auxetic tiles, the algorithm computes the minimum number of points that the tightening string must lift to fully deploy the 3D structure. Then, it finds the shortest path that connects those lift points, while including all areas of the object’s boundary that must be connected to guide the structure into its 3D configuration. It does these calculations in such a way that the optimal string path minimizes friction, enabling the structure to be smoothly actuated with just one pull.\n\n“Our method makes it easy for the user. All they have to do is input their design, and our algorithm automatically takes care of the rest. Then all the user needs to do is to fabricate the tiles exactly the way it has been computed by the algorithm,” Zaman says.\n\nFor instance, one could fabricate a structure using a multi-material 3D printer that prints the hinges of the tiles with a flexible material and the other surfaces with a hard material.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges the researchers faced was figuring out how the string route and the friction within the string channel can be effectively modeled as close to physical reality.\n\n“While playing with a few fabricated models, we observed that closing boundary tiles is a must to enable a successful deployment and the string must be routed through them. Later, we proved this observation mathematically. Then, we looked back at an age-old physics equation and used it to formulate the optimization problem for friction minimization,” he says.\n\nThey built their automatic algorithm into an interactive user interface that allows one to design and optimize configurations to generate manufacturable objects.\n\nThe researchers used their method to design several objects of different sizes, from personalized medical items including a splint and a posture corrector to an igloo-like portable structure. They also fabricated a deployable, human-scale chair they designed using their method.\n\nThis method is scale independent, so it could be used to create tiny deployable objects that are injected and actuated inside the body, or architectural structures, like the frame of a building, that are deployed and actuated on-site using cranes.\n\nIn the future, the researchers want to further explore the design of tiny structures, while also tackling the engineering challenges involved in creating architectural installations, such as determining the ideal cable thickness and the necessary strength of the hinges. In addition, they want to create a self-deploying mechanism, so the structures do not need to be actuated by a human or robot.\n\nThis research is funded, in part, by an MIT Research Support Committee Award.",

    "fullText": "on December 23, 2025\n\nI wrote\r\n last month about my diabetes diagnosis this year and my\r\n difficult choice to wear a proprietary device (called a\r\n CGM) on my arm 24/7\r\n to continuously monitor my glucose levels. Like my friend and colleague,\r\n Karen M. Sandler — who previously made a much higher-stakes choice to\r\n receive a proprietary implanted defibrillator to keep her safe given her\r\n genetic heart condition — I reluctantly chose to attach proprietary\r\n hardware and software to my body.\n\nThe device itself is quite proprietary, but fortunately\r\n the FOSS\r\n community has reverse engineered its activation and data collection\r\n protocols — creating an Android application that does a better job\r\n than the manufacturers' proprietary ones0.\n\nHere in the USA, we strangely use capitalism as the center of our health care system. Two major for-profit competing brands of CGM are\r\n available here. My diabetes specialist prefers the (ironically named)\r\n Freestyle Libre Plus from Abbott. I (also rather strangely) bring a prescription\r\n for electronics to a pharmacy every month. On 2025-12-03, that phramacy sent me an alarming text message (shown here).\n\nAfter reading that text, I\r\n found the\r\n USA FDA announcement. My spouse cross-referenced the lot numbers while I read them off from all my Freestyle boxes1. I had indeed recently worn an\r\nimpacted device!\n\nOnly because my diabetes is so early of a stage was I relatively safe. The FDA\r\n reports that Freestyle injured over 700 people and killed seven\r\n people with this bug. Spcifically, the bug caused the device to falsely report an\r\n extremely low glucose level. Advanced stage diabetics use low\r\n reading information to inform them that they may have too much insulin\r\n currently. The usual remedy is to eat something sugary to raise glucose in the blood. \r\n Such should be done only with great care, as a false low reading can harm and even kill the patient (who eats a high-sugar-content item while glucose in the blood is, in fact, not low).\n\nProprietary software in medical devices harming patients is not new. In\r\n 1985,\r\n the Therac-25\r\n killed three people. In 2020, hundreds of patients who relied on a financially troubled tech startup found their occular implants suddenly unsupported. Some patients went blind as the devices powered down without updates. There are more examples that I could include here, but rereading this horrific stories is frankly more than I can take right now when I think of fellow diabetes sufferers who were “killed by code” recently..\n\nIt's hubris for activists to guarantee that harm would be prevented if Freestyle had publicly released the\r\n hardware specifications and the complete, corresponding source code\r\n (CCS).\r\n FOSS isn't immune to bugs —\r\n even dangerous ones. However, in the centuries since the Enlightenment, we\r\n know that the scientific method depends on public disclosure about\r\n data and wide-reaching peer review of past work. FOSS (plus a publicly disclosed\r\n hardware design) wouid allow the millions of hardware and software engineers to\r\n peer-review the integrity, security, and safety of the devices to which\r\n patients entrust their lives. We achieve the promise of humanity when we\r\n each entrust our safety and health to our entire community — not\r\n merely a single for-profit entity.\n\nWe also will probably never know whether this issue was in hardware or\r\n software. The bug disclosure is incredibly vague, and it remains unclear\r\n how much investigation was done (if any) by government regulators into this\r\n problem. As a public policy and public health matter, the\r\n public deserves to know the technical details (software and\r\n hardware) of both the functioning device and the failed devices. NGOs should be permitted to perform\r\n their own investigations and confirmations of public safety.\n\nGiven that the hardware, software, and medical for-profit industries\r\nrefuse to put the rights, safety and security of patients first, wrongful\r\ndeath lawsuits are typically the only way to hold these companies\r\n accountable. Yet, there are very few people who have not agreed\r\nAbbott's toxic terms of their\r\n proprietary companion application — I guestimate \r\nthat fewer than 1% of\r\n Freestyle-using patients have used Juggluco from their very start (and\r\n thus never agreed to Abbott's terms). This is significant because Abbott includes a\r\n comprehensive one-way indemnity for themselves in the terms. I hope that a\r\n class action suit begins soon on this matter, but I wonder and worry that\r\n so much of the class may have signed this indemnity (which may make the road to justice\r\n bumpier).\n\nFinally, I want to offer that if there is anyone out there who does\r\n tear-downs of extremely tiny electronic devices, I would be thrilled to\r\n find a volunteer who would like to see if we can either extract any\r\n software components from the device, or reverse-engineer the hardware. I\r\n have saved and sanitized all of my prior CGMs.\r\n I'd gladly send one along\r\n to anyone who wants to give a try at taking them apart. (Contact SFC or contact me on the Fediverse (via Mastodon) if you're available to do this work.)\n\nFor my part, I look forward (after the Vizio trial) to\r\n sending some patches to\r\n Juggluco and also getting Juggluco available in F-Droid. Our best option in the face of\r\n these powerful medical device companies curtailing our rights is to invest\r\n our volunteer time into the edges where\r\n FOSS has\r\n resiliently worked around the constant roadblocks erected by bad\r\n actors.\n\n0My prior post about CGMs discussed the GPLv3'd Juggluco in more detail.\n\n1 In a fascinating turn of events, at least one of my past monitors (of which I fortitously saved all the boxes with the lot/serial number on them) is listed in the FDA's spreadsheet as recalled lot, yet the serial number is listed as “ safe to use” on Abbott's webform 🤔 … I'm left wondering how I can trust Abbott to write reliable software stuck into my arm if they can't even write a web form that cross-references serial numbers to lots correctly 😬.",

    "fullText": "OpenAI is in talks to raise up to $100 billion in a funding round that could value the ChatGPT maker at up to $830 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, citing anonymous sources.\n\nThe company is aiming to raise the funding by the end of the calendar first quarter next year, and it may ask sovereign wealth funds to invest in the round, the WSJ reported. The Information first reported news of the deal, though it said the fundraise would land OpenAI a $750 billion price tag.\n\nThe funding would come as OpenAI commits to spend trillions of dollars and strikes deals around the world as the company tries to stay ahead in the race to develop AI technology. The cash injection would also help the company with its spending on inferencing, which seems to be funded more by cash than cloud credits, suggesting the company’s compute costs have grown beyond what partnerships and credits can subsidize.\n\nAnd, as competition intensifies from rivals like Anthropic and Google, OpenAI has had to step on the gas to release new models and expand its presence in the developer and tooling ecosystem.\n\nMeanwhile, broader sentiment around AI has recently cooled as investors start doubting whether the pace of debt-fueled investment by giants like Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle, and OpenAI itself can be maintained in the long run. It also doesn’t help that the production of chips is being constrained by shortages in the supply of memory chips, which threatens to affect the broader tech sector.\n\nOpenAI has also been rumored to be working on an IPO as a way to raise tens of billions and fund its development efforts, which are currently said to be generating annual run-rate revenue of about $20 billion. There are also rumors that the company is courting Amazon for a $10 billion investment that would also give the AI lab access to the tech giant’s new AI computing chips.\n\nIf the fundraise happens, it would add a substantial amount to OpenAI’s coffers, which currently have more than $64 billion, according to PitchBook data. The company was most recently valued at about $500 billion in a secondary transaction.\n\nOpenAI did not immediately return a request for comment.",

    "fullText": "I use my line scan camera to take cool pictures of trains and other stuff.\n\nBut there’s a lot that goes into properly processing the images.\n\nThe way it works is that the camera has a single column of pixels (or in this case, two columns), that scans at a super high speed.\nThe camaera is stationary, but as a train moves past it, it gets scanned.\n\nThis is essentially also how a photo finish camera works.\n\nSince the background is static, it gets repeated for every column of the image, giving it its distinctive striped look.\n\nLine scan cameras are very suitable for capturing trains, since I can capture the full length of the train with minimal perspective distortion.\nThis is super nice for train nerds who want to make models of the trains.\nAlso, as you keep the camera running, you can get incredibly high resolution photos that span over 100,000 pixels wide.\n\nThis is because film is less sensitive than modern digital image sensors.\nHowever, you’ll need to know the approximate speed of the subject and pull the film across at roughly the right speed.\n\nI’m using an Alkeria Necta N4K2-7C.\nIt has a 4096×2 Bayer array image sensor.\nI’m saving its raw data in 16 bit binary arrays.\n\nSometimes, I keep the line scan camera running for a while, and it generates tons of boring data of the background.\nTo detect moving things, I compute an “energy function” that’s defined as\n\nwhere maxI\\text{max}_\\mathbf{I} is the maximum pixel value of the image, and the partial derivative are the image gradient.\n\nThis is because, for a static background, it will be full of horizontal stripes.\n\nHowever, doing this by itself risks noisy gradients in empty (but noisy) areas where the gradient direction is completely random.\nThe maximum pixel value term ensures that whatever gradient we see is salient.\n\nThe image is divided into chunks and the score of a chunk is the 99th percentile energy.\n\nFinally, chunks containing moving objects are defined to be ones where the score is at least 1.5× that of the minimum score.\n\nThis heuristic took me longer than I would like to admit to figure out.\nPreviously, I came up with heuristics that worked well on one capture but couldn’t generalize well to other captures.\nSometimes, the background will contain slowly moving foliage waving in the wind, that would screw up other methods of detection.\nThat resulted in a lot of wasted time because time spent processing empty regions seriously slows down iteration speed when developing the later steps.\n\nThe most common question I get is, how do I estimate the speed of the subject?\nIf I don’t do it properly, it will appear stretched out, squished, or flipped.\n\nTypically, I just set the camera to scan as fast as possible while maintaining a decent exposure, so the scan rate is independent of the subject.\nFaster subjects will appear squished, and slower subjects will appear stretched out.\n\nFor most of my earlier works, I just eyeballed it. A good rule of thumb is to look for round things such as the wheels and “no smoking” signs.\nBut now I have a fully automated technique that works fairly robustly.\n\nThe key idea is to exploit the fact that the line scan camera actually has two lines in a Bayer array, where one line is red, green, red, green, and the second line is green, blue, green blue.\n\nThe problem is that the data is very noisy, and salient features are sparse.\nHere’s the general approach:\n\nAs you can see, the data is noisy, but we have surprisingly decent granularity for this very subpixel case where we were scanning slower than needed so the spacing is like 0.5.\n\nThe value of the spline is actually the sample spacing. It tells us how close together or far apart the sample points in the original time series we should be using.\nThis leads us to the next section.\n\nHmm, I think my speed estimation still isn’t perfect. It could be off by about 10%.\nFor future work, I think I might be able to extract features correspondences such as SIFT or LightGlue. Trains are full of repeating elements that are supposed to be evenly spaced. I can detect those, and add a cost function to evenly space them, and optimize.\nAnother idea is to use a circle Hough transform to find circles.\n\nFrom the spline that gives us the sample spacing, we can basically generate the samples as such:\n\nHowever, there are a few gotchas:\n\nNow, for each sample position, we also store the sample width, which is the value of the spline.\nIf we were to simply extract a single column from the raw data, we would be throwing away a lot of data, and the result wouldn’t be antialiased.\nInstead, it is better to pick a window of width proportional to the sample spacing.\nI chose a Hann window.\n\nNot only is the first image very grainy, but the rapidly blinking LED display showing the characters for 筲箕灣 is completely illegible without proper sampling.\n\nAs you can see, the rectangular window performs very poorly when upsampling and introduces horrible jagged artifacts. The Hann window does better. Some other windows like the Sinc are even better supposedly.\n\nRecall that the camera has two lines forming a Bayer array.\n\nIf we simply create an image of half resolution (i.e. 2048 pixels tall instead of 4096), by grouping each RGGB group into one pixel, we would have some nasty fringing problems since the red and blue pixels are offset.\n\nInstead we should write out the image with careful attention to offsets, interpolating as necessary.\nNote that the horizontal offsets must be done after speed estimation, because, before speed estimation, the xx-axis is time, and after speed estimation, the xx-axis is space.\nBut the 2-pixel wide Bayer array is physically a spatial offset.\n\nI implemented a basic interpolation scheme that uses bilinear interpolation.\nThis fixes most of the fringing, although we can do even better. That will be left for future work.\n\nUnlike a traditional Bayer array, here we have the possibility that the green channels cover 100% of the pixels, so we can potentially do better than traditional demosaicing algorithms.\nBut there’s currently an annoying problem, which is that the two green channels on my line scan camera don’t match.\n\nVertical stripes in the image are common and are due to two main reasons:\n\nTo fix this, I use linear regression to fit a basic model of the form:\n\nwhere aa, bb, and cc are scalar parameters of the model, x\\mathbf{x} is a 2048-element vector containing the luminance value of the column (mean over the 4 channels), and k\\mathbf{k} is the row index (aka the 2048-element vector of [0,1,⋯ ,2047]\\begin{bmatrix}0, 1, \\cdots, 2047\\end{bmatrix}.\n\nYou can compose models as such:\n\nThis gives us a new model model12\\text{model}_{12} with parameters:\n\nThe associative property of the composition operator is left as an exercise for the reader.\n\nThere is also the identity model, i.e. one that does nothing, which is\n\nso the set of these models forms a mathematical group.\n\nI fit a model to each consecutive pair of columns using weighted least squares, where we assign each row element a weight based on a Gaussian.\nThe weight would be:\n\nIn other words, the residual would be\n\nAfter fitting this model, we redo the steps again several times, where the w\\mathbf{w} vector is recalculated each time.\nThis is known as iteratively-reweighted least squares and is pretty good at rejecting outliers.\n\nThis all gives us relative models between the previous column and the current column, but we want global models that tell us how to correct each column overall.\nWe could set the global models by just composing them forever, but they would soon start to drift arbitrarily far away from the identity model.\n\nYou could prevent them from drifting away by solving a band-diagonal linear system where you have residuals of two types:\n\nThis can be solved in O(n)O(n). However, it is a bit of work to implement. In practice, you can mitigate most high frequency stripes by just doing exponential smoothing, which basically acts as a high-pass filter\n\nfor some small λ\\lambda, in this case hardcoded to be 0.02.\n\nPreviously, I also had some success by directly fitting the model to line up each column with the first column. However, it doesn’t work for captures where the background isn’t static (e.g. rotating line scan panoramas, and pointing the line scan camera out of a moving train).\n\nIf a train were speeding up, it would appear stretched out at first, and squished at the end, and the striping would affect the end a lot more than the start.\n\nI implemented a patch-based denoiser, also known as block matching.\nIt works by making the observation that you often have repeated textures in a line scan photo of a train.\nTechnically, you also have lots of self-similarity in general photos, so patch-based denoising is a common method for denoising in general.\nHowever, one important distinction is that most denoisers only look in a small neighborhood around the current patch, but mine looks along the entire row.\n\nWhat I do is, for each row, we process it independently.\nFrom each 3×3 pixel patch, we can construct a feature vector of size 27 (9 times 3 channels, RGB).\nThen, we collect all these features and sort them by mean value.\nNow, for each position along the row, we search in the window of size 128 in the sorted vector.\nThe sorted vector will have similar-looking patches nearby, but we further weigh them by Gaussian similarity to the current patch.\nThen, we compute the weighted average of the center pixel of each of those patches.\n\nAnother trick is to realize that the noise is Poisson-distributed which has a standard deviation that scales with the square root of the signal.\nBut if I just square root the input data first, then we just need to compare it to a constant.\n\nThis works decently, but is incredibly slow.\nLet me know if you think of any faster ways to do it. A KD tree in feature space would die from the curse of dimensionality. Perhaps a hash table? To keep things lightweight, we can limit the population in each cell.\n\nThe good thing about the patch-based denoiser is that unique features like this passenger remain virtually unchanged.\n\nPreviously, I also tried using a total variation denoiser, processing each row and column independently.\nIt worked decently but would often destroy fine detail in textures.\n\nIf the camera isn’t perfectly upright, the resulting image may be slightly skewed.\nI’m planning on implementing automatic skew correction.\nBut here are two caveats:\n\nSo basically we’d need to generate a quick, poorly sampled version, run skew detection on it, and then sample it properly afterwards.\nWe can implement skew detection using a Hough transform.\nGenerally, I do a decent job of keeping the camera upright, so we just need to correct for very small skews, so a Hough transform is suitable (since the complexity scales with the number of bins of the histogram).\nWe can also use the energy function from the region of interest detector to primarily care about vertical structures.\n\nI kinda just eyeballed this color calibration matrix.\n\nBut to be honest it looks fairly decent.\n\nThe code is implemented in Python using numpy.\n\nDue to the large size of the data (4096 rows and hundreds of thousands of columns), it is sometimes impossible to fit all of it in memory, so the code takes several passes and outputs in chunks.\nActually, it is probably okay to fit it in a few gigabytes of RAM, but you’d have to chunk up the storage (there’s no way a contiguous numpy array of 4096 by 100,000 could be allocated).\n\nI tried using AI to help with a lot of the implementation. However, the results were mixed.\n\nAI would often accidentally make things quadratic for no reason when a linear time algorithm would suffice. For example, when trying to implement spline-based resampling, ChatGPT 5 came up with horribly slow (but vectorized) code that constructed a giant tensor with a mask across the entire width of the image for every single sample. Since there are 100,000 samples, and each mask was 100,000 columns wide, you can imagine it would take millennia to run. I ended up reimplementing it from scratch by hand. Then Grok 4 implemented weighted least squares regression by materializing the entire weight vector with np.diag instead of simply pre-multiplying each row of A and x with the square root of the weight before doing np.linalg.solve(A, x). Again, with 100,000 elements, making the square matrix with np.diag would have instantly run out of memory.\n\nBoth Grok 4 Expert and ChatGPT 5 Thinking also completely failed to implement the band-diagonal least squares to my vertical stripes strategy, but as mentioned, the exponential smoothing trick works okay for now.\n\nHowever, for some other stuff, AI was quite helpful.\nIt created a class that dynamically loads chunks from disk but provides the API to index and slice it.\nThat was neat.\nAI was also incredibly good at helping with Matplotlib’s arcane syntax.\n\nAdam Magyar uses a black and white digital line scan camera for his “Stainless” project, and another derived from a scanner for his “Urban Flow” project.\n\nHis camera must have much better sensitivity than mine since he managed to capture fairly clean images even for underground trains (whereas I generally require sunlight for mine).\nApparently, he had to scout out many subway stations to find ones where the lights don’t flicker at 60 Hz.\n\nAt kr64.seesaa.net you can find a mind boggling collection of high quality line scan photos of trains from all across Japan.\n\nThey probably do this full time as the variety of trains is far greater than I can ever hope to achieve.\nI believe they use a film slit scan camera.\n\nUnfortunately, their website has a bunch of technical issues and often goes down. I would be happy to help them out but my Japanese is very poor and I don’t see any way to contact them.",

    "description": "A look at the surprising probabilities behind a simple coin flipping game",
    "fullText": "Three heads are certainly more fun\n\nYou’re playing a game with your lying friends Alice and Bob.\n\nBob flips a coin and shows it to Alice. Alice tells you what she saw - but she lies 20% of the time. Then you take your best guess on whether the coin is heads or tails.\n\nYour best strategy is to trust whatever Alice says. You’re right 80% of the time.\n\nNow Bob joins in. He makes up his mind independent of Alice, and he also lies 20% of the time 1.\n\nYou were right 80% of the time by trusting Alice.\n\nHow much better can you do with Bob’s help?\n\nI’m going to give you the answer below. So here’s some empty space for you to think in case you want to do the math yourself.\n\nThe answer is 0% - you don’t do any better! You’re still exactly 80% to get the right answer.\n\nTo establish this, let’s write a simple simulation. We’ll flip a coin a million times, ask our friends what they saw, and observe the results.\n\nFor our strategy, we’ll look at a fact pattern (like “Alice says heads”), figure out what’s most likely (“the coin is heads”), and say “we guess the coin flip correctly whenever the most likely outcome occurs for this fact pattern” 2.\n\n“Guess the most likely outcome” is optimal here, but it is very much not\noptimal if this game was adversarial. It’s important that Alice and Bob aren’t\ntrying to trick us and that they’re deciding independently.\n\nHere’s the code for that simulation. We’ll start with the easy case (just Alice):\n\nNow let’s add Bob to the simulation. We see something like this:\n\nThat’s weird! But perhaps this gives you an intuition for what’s happening. By introducing a second player, we introduce the possibility of a tie.\n\nA decent amount of the time, Alice and Bob agree. Most (~94%) of the time when that happens, they’re telling the truth. Occasionally they’re both lying, but that’s pretty unlikely.\n\nBut a meaningful portion of the time (32%) Alice says heads and Bob says tails, or vice versa. And in that case we don’t know anything at all! Alice and Bob are equally trustworthy and they disagreed - we’d be better off if we’d just gone and asked Alice 3!\n\nI am deeply curious whether anyone else was read the book “Go Ask Alice” by\ntheir middle school science teacher in order to scare them straight or whether\nthat was specific to my middle school experience.\n\nNow that we’ve simulated this result, let’s walk through each case assuming that the coin landed on heads.\n\nThere’s something beautiful here. Our total chance to guess remains at 80% because our additional chance to guess correctly when Alice and Bob agree is perfectly offset by the chance that Alice and Bob disagree!\n\nIf our friend Charlie - who also lies 20% of the time - joins the fun, our odds improve substantially. If Bob and Alice disagree, Charlie can act as a tiebreaker.\n\nBut if David joins, the pattern repeats. David introduces the possibility of a 2-2 split, and our odds don’t improve at all!\n\nAnd this continues, on and on, forever (as long as we have enough friends). If our number N of friends is odd, our chances of guessing correctly don’t improve when we move to N+1 friends.\n\nAs far as I can tell, there’s no name for this weird little phenomenon. But it does appear, implicitly, in voting literature.\n\nCondorcet’s jury theorem is a famous theorem in political science. It states:\n\nSounds a fair bit like our coin flipping problem. Here’s a simplifying assumption that Wikipedia makes when proving the theorem:\n\nHah! The proof explicitly recognizes (and dodges) the even-voter case precisely because that voter doesn’t add any information.\n\nI stumbled upon this result while writing a simulation for a more complex problem. I was so surprised at the simulation results that I assumed that I had a bug in my code. And when I walked through the math by hand I was absolutely delighted.\n\nI suspect some of the surprise for me was because I typically encounter problems like these in the context of betting, not voting. If we’re betting on coin flips, we’re certainly excited to bet more if Alice and Bob agree than if we’re just listening to Alice.\n\nBut voting is a different beast; our outcome is binary. There’s no way to harvest the additional EV from the increased confidence Bob sometimes gives us.\n\nAnyway. I hope this delights you like it did me.",

    "description": "SpaceX's purchases could add up to anywhere between $80 million to $160 million in sales for Tesla.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk is resorting to one of the oldest tricks in the book, robbing Peter to pay Paul, to boost demand for Cybertrucks.\n\nElectrek reported on how Musk is using one of his companies, SpaceX, to help make up for a massive shortfall of a market for the controversial Cybertruck.\n\nTesla is facing challenges selling even 20,000 Cybertrucks annually, far below Musk's initial projections of 500,000, per Electrek's analysis. As a result, Tesla is left with large stockpiles of the vehicles even as they've heavily reduced their production.\n\nMaking a small dent in the inventory is SpaceX. The company has already bought over 1,000 Cybertrucks with room to double its fleet. An X user shared a video of a lot teeming with the vehicles.\n\nAt a starting retail price of $80,000, SpaceX's purchases could add up to anywhere between $80 million to $160 million in sales for Tesla.\n\nAs Electrek pointed out, there is nothing illegal about Musk's machinations here. Still, essentially having to bail out a failing product isn't good news for Tesla nor the best move for SpaceX.\n\nInvestors certainly should be concerned that Musk's moves here are self-serving. There's also the matter of SpaceX receiving large help from the government, and then turning around and buying Cybertrucks.\n\n\"In other words, government subsidies that were meant to get us back to the moon are being used to buy unsellable trucks that look like big dumpsters,\" a frustrated commenter on Electrek opined.\n\nMusk's struggles in moving Cybertrucks provide another example of overpromising and underdelivering. Before it was released, the vehicle had over one million reservations. Only a mere 60,000 of those were converted into sales.\n\nDo you think America should produce more car parts than it does now?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nElectrek chalked up that failure to consumers picking up on a bait-and-switch from Tesla after unveiling their 2019 prototype. The actual Cybertruck is more expensive, has less range, and boasts fewer attractive features.",

    "description": "Trump suggested Democrats ‘loved Jeffrey Epstein’ and said they should ‘enjoy what may be your last Merry Christmas!’",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has shared a bizarre Christmas day social media post about Jeffrey Epstein, saying that he dropped ties with the late sex offender “long before it became fashionable,” and that the controversy surrounding the release of the so-called Epstein files is a “Radical Left Witch Hunt.”\n\nThe Trump administration has been facing ongoing scrutiny, mainly from Democrats but also some Republicans, for its handling of government files related to Epstein as the public pushes for more transparency about the disgraced financiers’ life and crimes.\n\n“Merry Christmas to all, including the many Sleazebags who loved Jeffrey Epstein...only to ‘drop him like a dog’ when things got too HOT, falsely claimed they had nothing to do with him, didn’t know him, said he was a disgusting person, and then blame, of course, President Donald J. Trump, who was actually the only one who did drop Epstein, and long before it became fashionable to do so,” Trump wrote on Truth Social Thursday evening.\n\nThe president was friends with Epstein decades ago, calling him a “terrific guy” in a 2002 New York magazine profile. In the midst of the Epstein controversy, The Wall Street Journal reported on a lewd birthday card Trump supposedly gave Epstein in 2003, but the president has denied that he authored such a letter.\n\nBut Trump has said their relationship ended before Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting a minor for prostitution. The White House has said Trump did “nothing wrong” and that the president kicked Epstein out of his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach for being a “creep.”\n\nTrump suggested in Wednesday’s Truth Social post that these people who thought Epstein was “the greatest guy on earth” were all Democrats.\n\n“When their names get brought out in the ongoing Radical Left Witch Hunt...and it is revealed that they are Democrats all, there will be a lot of explaining to do...Enjoy what may be your last Merry Christmas!” Trump wrote.\n\nWhen the Justice Department started to release its trove of Epstein documents last Friday — thanks to Congress pushing through legislation to force the Trump administration to reveal all the information it had on the convicted sex offender — photos of former Democratic President Bill Clinton emerged.\n\nIn one photo, Clinton and Epstein were smiling as they stood next to each other wearing silky shirts. In another, Clinton was swimming in a pool with Epstein’s longtime associate and convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell.",

    "fullText": "A theme park on the banks of the Potomac River outside Washington, DC, was abandoned over 50 years ago. The grounds are quiet, the attractions are empty, and long vines cover portions of the art deco structures.\n\nI'm talking about Glen Echo Park, in Glen Echo, Maryland.\n\nI visited in 2022 and found remnants of the park that once was, as well as an artists' hub that has developed since it closed.\n\nThe land was originally developed for a National Chautauqua Assembly that taught arts, literature, language, and sciences, according to the park's website.\n\nThe park housed several rides and attractions, including seven roller coasters, an arcade, and a pool, according to Atlas Obscura.\n\nThe park became decreasingly popular in the mid-1960s, and it closed after the 1968 season, according to the Library of Congress.\n\nOver time, organizations have repurposed the park's structures to house educational facilities, studios, galleries, and arts venues.\n\nThe entrance to the park had a gigantic sign visible from the adjacent highway. I imagine this must have helped attract visitors back in the day.\n\nThis stand and many other structures in the park were renovated between 2003 and 2010, according to a Glen Echo Park catalog.\n\nAccording to the park's site, the carousel pieces were hand-carved by the Dentzel Carousel Company in the early 1900s.\n\nEach animal was restored between 1983 and 2003, and the carousel is on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nWhile the teacups are gone, the space that covered them remains.\n\nToday, the buildings house galleries and educational facilities. I spotted a music school and a glass art school.\n\nAccording to the National Park Service, the pool was constructed in 1931 and could accommodate up to 3,000 people, featuring diving boards, a water slide, and an artificial beach.\n\nToday, parts of the area have been overrun by nature.\n\nAccording to the Glen Echo Park catalog, these yurts house art classes.\n\nInside, there are animal exhibits and interactive displays, as well as a submarine, according to the aquarium's website.\n\nStrolling through the woods was the perfect way to end my trip to this abandoned wonderland surrounded by nature.",

    "description": "Season four of \"Bridgerton,\" streaming on January 29, will center on Benedict Bridgerton's love story. Here's what we know so far.",
    "fullText": "Get your masks ready: Season four of \"Bridgerton\" is coming to Netflix in 2026. Part one premieres on January 29, and part two will come a month later on February 26.\n\nThis season will follow the story of Benedict Bridgerton and Sophie Baek in a \"Cinderella\"-esque tale.\n\nSeason three of the Netflix series, which centered on Colin Bridgerton (Luke Newton) and Penelope Featherington's (Nicola Coughlan) relationship, concluded with the release of part two in June 2024.\n\nIn giving Polin a happy ending, \"Bridgerton\" also teased that Benedict (Luke Thompson), the second-eldest sibling, would get the main character treatment next season. His status as the lead has officially been confirmed, and new details are slowly being announced — and now, fans are able to watch the first trailer for season four as a Christmas present from the streamer.\n\nHere's everything we know about season four of \"Bridgerton\" so far.\n\nAn official announcement about Benedict being the season four lead was made in July 2024. In a video posted by Netflix, Thompson is handed a suit for the masquerade ball. But eagle-eyed fans weren't surprised, because this was all teased in the season three finale that aired in June.\n\nAs Eloise Bridgerton (Claudia Jessie) prepared to head off to Scotland with Francesca Bridgerton (Hannah Dodd), John Stirling (Victor Alli), and Michaela Stirling (Masali Baduza) in the episode, she assured Benedict that she'd only be gone until next year.\n\n\"Do you think Mama would ever let me miss her Masquerade Ball?\" she said.\n\nBenedict, still not ready to settle down, replied, \"I will be there, hiding out behind a mask, avoiding eligible ladies like the plague.\"\n\nThat not-so-subtle moment was a nod to Benedict's novel \"An Offer from a Gentleman,\" which is part of Julia Quinn's \"Bridgerton\" book series.\n\nIn the third \"Cinderella\"-inspired book, Benedict meets a woman named Sophie Beckett at a masquerade ball. Unbeknownst to him, Sophie is a servant to a rude stepmother named Araminta Gunningworth. By the end of the novel, they express their love for each other and get married.\n\nThe show has changed Sophie's last name from Beckett to Baek to reflect actor Yerin Ha's Korean heritage.\n\n\"A name is the first bit of identity that you share with the world, and that's why changing a name can be so powerful,\" Ha told Tudum. \"To make Sophie's name fit someone who looks like me is really empowering. All credit to Jess Brownell, our showrunner.\"\n\nNetflix's official logline for next season reads: \"The fourth season of 'Bridgerton' turns its focus to bohemian second son Benedict (Luke Thompson). Despite his elder and younger brothers both being happily married, Benedict is loath to settle down — until he meets a captivating Lady in Silver at his mother's masquerade ball.\"\n\nHere's the first full official trailer for the fourth season.\n\nHa was most recently seen on the Paramount+ TV series adaptation of the \"Halo\" video game franchise and HBO's \"Dune\" spin-off series \"Dune: Prophecy.\"\n\nDespite the character being based on Cinderella, Brownell assured fans that Sophie is \"no damsel in distress.\"\n\n\"She is someone who has chess moves and is always thinking two, three steps ahead,\" Brownell said at the \"Bridgerton\" virtual fan event called \"Season of Love\" in February 2025. \"So she's absolutely gonna throw Benedict for a loop.\"\n\nKatie Leung, who played Cho Chang in the \"Harry Potter\" film series, will portray Lady Araminta Gao.\n\nHer character description reads: \"Twice-married and twice-widowed, Araminta has two daughters debuting on the marriage mart this season and she's feeling the pressure to get at least one of her girls married off. Fabulous, discerning, and blunt, Araminta does not respond well when anything — or anyone — threatens her standing in society.\"\n\nMichelle Mao will play Rosamund Li, Araminta's eldest daughter who's \"beautiful, vain, and eager to please her mother.\" According to her official description, Rosamund will be vying for Benedict's heart when she hits the marriage mart.\n\nIsabella Wei will play Posy Li, Araminta's youngest daughter, who's described as kind and chatty.\n\nAt the \"Season of Love\" event, Brownell said that the new installment will show Colin as a \"wife guy\" and the couple raising their baby, whose name has yet to be revealed.\n\nBrownell previously told TheWrap that she'd like the pair to continue on the show beyond season four because she thinks there are more stories to be told. Newton similarly told Teen Vogue that he's committed to staying on the show indefinitely.\n\nBrownell elaborated on Polin's place in season four in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, saying that the couple will shift to being part of the larger ensemble.\n\n\"I do think that there is a bit more to tell story-wise with Whistledown,\" she said. \"Whistledown has been the narrative glue of every season. Now that Penelope's out publicly as Whistledown, I want to see more of what that's like. So, we will continue with them next season for sure.\"\n\nOn December 21, the \"Bridgerton\" X account announced that Colin and Penelope's newborn son, Elliot, would be part of the season's story.\n\nIn addition to the confirmed returns of Coughlan and Newton, Julie Andrews will also be back as the voice of Lady Whistledown.\n\nKanthony fans have been wondering how long Kate (Simone Ashley) and Anthony Bridgerton (Jonathan Bailey) will stay on the show after leading season two.\n\nPrevious season leads have largely stepped away after their story arcs concluded, but Anthony and Kate are the new heads of the Bridgerton household, which means they have to stick around.\n\nIn season three, Anthony and Kate show up in four episodes, often disappearing on trips around the world. The show writers likely did this to explain the characters' disappearance so Ashley and Bailey could film other projects (Bailey, in particular, was pulling triple duty, also working on \"Wicked\" and \"Fellow Travelers\").\n\nIn season three, episode seven, Anthony and Kate leave for a trip to India so Kate can visit her home and give birth to their first child. Though this looks like a convenient way to write the couple off the show entirely, that's not the case.\n\nBrownell told Entertainment Weekly in June that Anthony and Kate heading to India allows the two actors to work on other projects \"while still leaving the door open for them to return when and if they're able.\"\n\n\"So the India send-off is a plot device in certain ways that allows us to leave the door open,\" she said.\n\nAnd the \"Bridgerton\" virtual event in February 2025 officially confirmed that Bailey and Ashley are indeed returning, including both in the official cast list for season four of \"Bridgerton.\"\n\nFans will see \"more of their marital bliss and seeing their baby as well,\" Brownell said.\n\nHowever, fans didn't get a glimpse of them in the first trailer.\n\nAfter tying the knot at the end of season three — and meeting her husband's intriguing cousin, Michaela — Francesca and John will be back for at least the beginning of season four before heading back to Scotland.\n\nFans of the book series know that Francesca's time as the series' main character is coming. Her book, the sixth in the series, is called \"When He Was Wicked.\"\n\nWe won't spoil the story for anyone who hasn't read Julia Quinn's books (though you can read about Francesca's book here), but it's safe to say that the show made one of its biggest departures from the book series when it introduced John's cousin, Michaela. In the novel, John's beloved cousin is named Michael.\n\nAt the virtual event, Brownell teased where fans will see the \"Bridgerton\" characters at the start of season four.\n\nThe showrunner alluded to Lady Violet Bridgerton (Ruth Gemmell) continuing her flirtations with Lord Marcus Anderson (Daniel Francis) and moving beyond the giggling that defined their season three interactions.\n\nViolet will also be busy trying to prepare her unmarried kids for the future. While Francesca got married last season, her siblings Eloise and Hyacinth (Florence Hunt) haven't reached that milestone yet.\n\n\"Violet is once again trying to put Eloise on the marriage mart and she's absolutely dreading it,\" Brownell said.\n\nOn the flip side, Hyacinth \"is desperate to pre-debut early. And the two of them get paired together this season for comedic results.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Gregory (Will Tilston), the youngest son, is \"going to get sent off to Eton for a little while, but that gives him time to come back no longer a gangly teenager but a young man.\"\n\nAs for the rest of the Ton, Brownell said that fans will see more of Queen Charlotte (Golda Rosheuvel), who has a new dynamic with Penelope now that she knows who Lady Whistledown is. Additionally, season four will expand on Queen Charlotte and Lady Agatha Danbury's (Adjoa Andoh) relationship.\n\nLady Danbury, who often vacillates between meddling and advising other characters, will help Will (Martins Imhangbe) and Alice Mondrich (Emma Naomi) navigate a new challenge as they settle into being members of society.\n\nSeason three of \"Bridgerton\" gives more insight into Cressida's (Jessica Madsen) difficult home life and the lengths she'll go to in order to get out of her situation.\n\nDuring the season, she attempts to take credit for Lady Whistledown so she can receive the reward money and avoid marrying an older man, but the plan backfires. Then, when she learns that Penelope is Lady Whistledown, she attempts to blackmail her with the intention of using the money to escape town and avoid being sent off to live with her aunt in Wales.\n\nBut Cressida is outsmarted and is last seen being sent away in a carriage to live with her relative after tarnishing the Cowper family's reputation.\n\nIn separate June 2024 interviews with The Hollywood Reporter, Entertainment Weekly, and The Los Angeles Times, Brownell said that Cressida's story isn't over yet.\n\n\"It felt a little early in this season for her to get a happily ever after just because we've watched two seasons of her being a real bully to Penelope. She has a little bit more growth to do, but I do want to give her a happy ending eventually,\" she told EW.\n\n\"We want to see more from Jessica Madsen,\" Brownell told THR. \"So we wanted to leave her story a little bit more open-ended so that we can craft an ending for her in future seasons.\"\n\nAt the virtual event, Brownell said that every season follows a romantic trope, and season four is all about \"forbidden love.\"\n\n\"That class clash gives us a very serious obstacle and the stakes could not be higher this year, so it's really a juicy one,\" she said.\n\n\"The theme of the season is really about true love being somewhere in between fantasy and reality,\" Brownell added.\n\nThe new season will delve into Benedict's status as a member of high society and Sophie's role as a maid. And after spending three seasons focusing on the happenings of the wealthy characters, season four will broaden the world to follow the working-class characters below them.\n\n\"Because you are now so familiar with the upstairs, I think viewers know just how difficult a pairing between a gentleman and a maid will be,\" Brownell said.\n\nHa said that Sophie's job as a maid at Penwood House, where she works for Lady Araminta, is high stakes.\n\n\"Living under that Penwood House is a mode of survival for her because if she doesn't, then she has nowhere else to go,\" Ha said. \"I think it also highlights just how hard it was being a maid in that era. You mess up and your life can turn upside down in a second, and I think we're trying really hard to portray those dynamics.\"\n\nBrownell said that the all-important masquerade ball where Benedict and Sophie meet will be \"a very large chunk of the first episode.\" She also said that the aesthetic of the ball was inspired by William Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" and the vibe is \"dark and mysterious and fairytale-like.\"\n\nFans can see a glimpse of Benedict looking enamored by Sophie at the masquerade ball in a sneak peek clip posted by Netflix in May.\n\nAside from the masquerade ball, season four will pull additional elements from the book, like My Cottage — which is Benedict's countryside home — and a nearby lake that fans of the novel will be familiar with.\n\n\"I do think that this season is the most faithful to the book,\" Brownell said. \"It really lends itself to adaptation plot-wise. It's very similar.\"\n\nStill, some aspects were changed for the Netflix adaptation, like character motivations.\n\n\"Benedict is quite different from the book just in that Luke Thompson brings this wonderful sensitivity and self-awareness to the character,\" Brownell said. \"So in Benedict's story of trying to woo Sophie, I think the character is a bit more delicate and thoughtful, perhaps, about the way he goes about it.\"\n\nBrownell told the Los Angeles Times that they chose to film the season during the fall partly for storytelling purposes, but also out of practicality.\n\n\"It's still going to be just as lush and colorful, but just \n\nNetflix confirmed that season four will consist of episodes, just like the past installments. The two parts will air on January 29 and February 26.\n\nIn addition to the coming fourth season, \"Bridgerton\" has been renewed for seasons five and six.\n\nThis is a developing story.

    "title": "Why retirement may be harder to reach for many older Americans in 2026",
    "description": "More older Americans are returning to work due to financial insecurity and rising costs, as surveys show retirees fear their savings won't last,",
    "fullText": "It may be increasingly common next year to see an older worker staffing the cash register at your local grocery store.\n\nSurveys released in recent months suggest that older Americans are more worried about having to unretire, fearing their savings won't last them 20 to 30 years. US Bank's 2025 Wealth Report, released in September, shows that nearly two-thirds of Americans worry they may have to reenter the workforce, while 58% of people believe their money will last them in their retirement years.\n\nThis is echoed by ResumeBuilder.com's survey of 3,574 Americans aged 65 and older, released last week. The survey reveals that nearly one in eight plan to rejoin the workforce in 2026 or already have. Over a third of older Americans still working don't plan to retire until the next decade. About 4% of older Americans surveyed are applying for jobs, while 8% returned to work over the last few years. Slightly over 70% reported being retired. These findings are similar to the past two iterations of the survey.\n\nAnd a third survey from AARP Research from October found that 6% of retirees went back to work in the past six months due to a negative economic outlook.\n\nOver the past year, I've spoken to over 250 older Americans, most of whom still work. The majority said they never retired or unretired because of financial uncertainty. Some lived paycheck to paycheck with limited savings and no defined-benefit pension plan. Others had six figures in the bank but knew the money would run dry if they faced a sudden diagnosis or emergency. Many others worked because they wanted to feel fulfilled, have a purpose and a community, and stay active.\n\nAs Americans reflect on 2025 in its final week, many retirees are calculating and stress-testing if they have enough to endure various financial situations. For those falling short, unretiring may be the best option.\n\nIn 2021, the Bureau of Labor Statistics outlined that the labor force for Americans 75 and older is expected to grow by upwards of 96% through 2030. Census Bureau data shows that in 2024, nearly 20% of people 65 and older worked at least part-time.\n\nTo be sure, the unretirement rate from pre-COVID through mid-2024 has steadily declined from 3.2% in late 2018 to 1.9%, which suggests older workers are struggling to rejoin the labor market.\n\nMy 80 Over 80 series, which explored why people continue to work into their 80s and 90s, found that 4.2% of Americans 80 and older work, the highest it's been in decades. Many unretired after months, years, or decades of not working.\n\nThese recent surveys, as well as some from earlier this year, show that retirement is elongating as life spans grow — and may be harder to achieve in the coming years.\n\n\"Because of the rise in costs, people's fixed incomes, their Social Security benefits, aren't enough to cover all their expenses,\" said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democrat from New York, in an interview with Business Insider. \"We know that 47% of workers lack access to employer-sponsored retirement plans, and 55% report no dedicated retirement savings. We know that many seniors won't have enough money to retire comfortably.\"\n\nSurveys published this year continue to show that Americans prioritize a healthy and stable retirement. However, many aren't taking the necessary steps to get there, and many aren't in financial or employment situations to do so.\n\nThe US Bank report found that 37% of working adults are actively preparing for retirement, while 48% of Americans contribute to their retirement savings. Nearly a quarter of Generation X respondents said they have abandoned their goal of retiring. Three-quarters of millennials and Generation Z worried about needing to come out of retirement, as many of the traditional milestones — buying a house or starting a family — feel harder to grasp.\n\nThis year hasn't done many favors for older Americans, either. The Resume Builder survey found that 54% of older Americans who still work or are unretiring cited the high cost of living, while a similar amount said they enjoyed work. Inflation has remained stubbornly high this year, registering at 2.7% for the 12 months ending in November. Inflation has been higher than the overall average for housing and various medical expenses.\n\nThe survey further found that over a quarter of older workers were nervous about potential Social Security changes, while a fifth were concerned about Medicare changes.\n\n\"For many seniors, retirement has become more flexible than final,\" said ResumeBuilder.com's chief career advisor Stacie Haller in the survey release. \"At the same time, today's workplace offers far more flexible opportunities for older professionals.\"\n\nFaced with a difficult job market, though, many older Americans said they won't relinquish their job because they anticipate not being able to find another, citing factors such as ageism. The AARP Research survey found that nearly two-thirds of older workers believe it would be challenging for them to find another job, especially since older workers already experience longer stretches of unemployment on average than younger people.\n\nOthers who unretired said they've opted for part-time employment or gig work, which were easier to secure and maintain. A few returned to school or took online classes to improve their skills in hopes of finding more stable employment.\n\nTo be sure, many of those still working into their 70s, 80s, and 90s told Business Insider that they wouldn't retire even if they had the means to. However, dozens said they wished they could work fewer hours, more flexible hours, or in a different profession that didn't wear them down as much.\n\nThroughout the year, experts on retirement and aging stressed that returning to work was not something to view as shameful. Research papers overwhelmingly show the benefits of continuing to work in one's later years, such as sustained cognitive function and improved mental health outcomes — provided the worker has flexibility and can handle the job.\n\nThese insights seemed to put some older readers at ease. In interviews, dozens of workers in their 80s said they felt like a failure for not being in a position to retire or pass down a significant inheritance to their children, though hearing that they weren't alone made them feel more confident. In responses and emails to my articles, some older readers said they considered going back to work after reading about many people who successfully did so.\n\nDozens of politicians, researchers on aging, and anti-ageism advocates said more should be done in the short term to ensure older Americans have the employment opportunities they need to live comfortably and have more financial support to guide them through their later years. To be sure, some experts said that returning to work shouldn't be the long-term solution, as the safety net should be more robust so people only need to return to work if they desire.\n\n\"A lot of our older adults need resources to survive, and so we want to make sure that the workforce is available to them, and they won't be discriminated against from being hired and working if they need to,\" Gillibrand said in reference to the Protecting Older Americans Act she co-introduced.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump might be president, but even he has to endure holiday dinners with his in-laws.\n\nTrump, 79, spent Christmas Eve at his Mar-a-Lago estate alongside family members including First Lady Melania Trump, 55, and her father, Viktor Knavs—who is just two years the president’s senior.\n\nThe trio was seated together at an extravagant Christmas Eve dinner Wednesday night at the Palm Beach resort, which Forbes valued at $325 million in 2023. In video footage circulating online from the event, Knavs, 81, appears animated as he chats with his daughter, who leans in closely to hear him.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, stares straight ahead, seemingly frozen out of the conversation. He sits glumly scanning the room before he notices the camera is on him, prompting a stiff, performative fist shake.\n\nCritics of the president were quick to seize on the moment online, pointing to what they described as Melania’s lack of interest. “Could she sit any farther away?” one X user quipped. “Trump seethes with rage & embarrassment that Melania only wants to talk to her dad,” another wrote in a post viewed 1.6 million times.\n\nKnavs and his late wife, Amalija, both worked in fashion and sales in Slovenia before relocating to the United States after their daughter married the real estate scion. They became naturalized U.S. citizens in 2018, despite their son-in-law’s hardline stance on immigration.\n\nA fixture of the president’s family life, Knavs has appeared at events ranging from Trump’s inauguration to his Thanksgiving dinner table. When Barron Trump—the president’s youngest son and the only child he shares with the first lady—graduated from the prestigious Oxbridge Academy in West Palm Beach, Florida, in May 2024, Knavs was the only family member in attendance besides Barron’s parents, the Palm Beach Post reported.\n\nMelania Trump and Barron Trump are both known to have close relationships with the Slovenian businessman. Melania Trump was largely absent from the now-president’s third and final campaign as she cared for her mother, Amalija Knavs, who died Jan. 9, 2024, and was laid to rest in Palm Beach, according to reports.\n\nBarron Trump remained close to his grandfather throughout the funeral, according to reports.\n\nIn 2016, Melania Trump’s childhood friends told The New York Times that they remembered Knavs—who was a member of the elite Communist Party in what was then Yugoslavia—as a “larger-than-life personality” much like Trump himself.\n\nAt the time, Trump’s campaign denied that Melania Trump’s father was ever an “active member” of the party.\n\n“But he was pretty successful over there,” Trump said in a 2016 interview. “It’s a different kind of success than you have here. But he was successful.”\n\nTrump may have appeared fatigued at dinner after a jam-packed afternoon, during which he took calls from children across the United States as part of the North American Aerospace Defense Command’s Santa tracker.\n\nIn true Trump fashion, the decades-old presidential tradition took a political turn.\n\n“Pennsylvania is great. We won Pennsylvania, actually three times, but we won Pennsylvania. We won it in a landslide. So I love Pennsylvania,” Trump enthusiastically told a 5-year-old from the Keystone State—who was not yet alive during his first two presidential campaigns.\n\nThe president later capped off Christmas Eve with a scathing post on Truth Social, decrying what he called the “Radical Left Scum.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",

    "fullText": "MARACAY, Venezuela (AP) — This was not the Christmas that Mariela Gómez would have imagined a year ago. Or the one that thousands of other Venezuelan immigrants would have thought. But Donald Trump returned to the White House in January and quickly ended their American dream.\n\nSo Gómez found herself spending the holiday in northern Venezuela for the first time in eight years. She dressed up, cooked, got her son a scooter and smiled for her in-laws. Hard as she tried, though, she could not ignore the main challenges faced by returning migrants: unemployment and poverty.\n\n“We had a modest dinner, not quite what we’d hoped for, but at least we had food on the table,” Gómez said of the lasagna-like dish she shared with her partner and in-laws instead of the traditional Christmas dish of stuffed corn dough hallacas. “Making hallacas here is a bit expensive, and since we’re unemployed, we couldn’t afford to make them.”\n\nGómez, her two sons and her partner returned to the city of Maracay on Oct. 27 after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border to Texas, where they were quickly swept up by U.S. Border Patrol amid the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration. They were deported to Mexico, from where they began the dangerous journey back to Venezuela.\n\nThey crossed Central America by bus, but once in Panama, the family could not afford to continue to Colombia via boat in the Caribbean. Instead, they took the cheaper route along the Pacific’s choppy waters, sitting on top of sloshing gasoline tanks in a cargo boat for several hours and then transferring to a fast boat until reaching a jungled area of Colombia. They spent about two weeks there until they were wired money to make it to the border with Venezuela.\n\nGómez was among the more than 7.7 million Venezuelans who left their home country in the last decade, when its economy came undone as a result of a drop in oil prices, corruption and mismanagement. She lived in Colombia and Peru for years before setting her sights on the U.S. with hopes of building a new life.\n\nTrump’s second term has dashed the hopes of many like Gómez.\n\nAs of September, more than 14,000 migrants, mostly from Venezuela, had returned to South America since Trump moved to limit migration to the U.S., according to figures from Colombia, Panama and Costa Rica. In addition, Venezuelans were steadily deported to their home country this year after President Nicolás Maduro, under pressure from the White House, did away with his long-standing policy of not accepting deportees from the U.S.\n\nImmigrants arrived regularly at the airport outside the capital, Caracas, on flights operated by a U.S. government contractor or Venezuela’s state-owned airline. More than 13,000 immigrants returned this year on the chartered flights.\n\nGómez’s return to Venezuela also allowed her to see the now 20-year-old daughter she left behind when she fled the country’s complex crisis. They talked and drank beer during the holiday knowing it might be the last time they share a drink for a while — Gómez’s daughter will migrate to Brazil next month.\n\nGómez is hoping to make hallacas for New Year’s Eve and is also hoping for a job. But her prayers for next year are mostly for good health.\n\n“I ask God for many things, first and foremost life and health, so we can continue enjoying our family,” she said.\n\nGarcia Cano reported from Caracas.",

    "description": "\"One of the reasons I want a Tesla!\"",
    "fullText": "A passerby noticed an unexpected passenger peering out the window of a parked Tesla — a puppy. While such a sight is often worrying, a unique Tesla feature put their mind at ease.\n\n\"Spotted the cutest floof,\" a Facebook user shared in a Dogspotting group. The Tesla's touchscreen reads, \"My driver will be back soon,\" and displays the internal temperature of the electric vehicle as 22 degrees Celsius (around 72 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nWhile leaving a pet in a car may not seem dangerous, temperatures can heat up quickly, particularly on a hot day. Analysis from Total.vet found that the majority of heat-related pet deaths occurred when the animal's owners left them trapped inside hot vehicles.\n\nBecause of this, California and other states have laws allowing rescues under certain conditions. However, this can lead to unnecessarily broken glass if a vehicle is running remotely, leaving the pet in a safe and comfortable environment.\n\nTesla's \"Dog Mode\" ingeniously eliminates the potential for misunderstanding. Other Facebook users were impressed by the adorable display.\n\n\"One of the reasons I want a Tesla!\" one commenter shared.\n\n\"That Tesla feature omg. I hate them but I'd buy it specifically for my dogs,\" another said.\n\nAs evidenced by the fact that this Facebook post is a couple of years old, Tesla has been a polarizing brand for years. Anti-EV sentiment fueled by misinformation has played a role, while CEO Elon Musk's political activities and social media feuds have turned the company into a lightning rod for criticism in 2025, even contributing to a sales slump in key markets.\n\nMore broadly, though, demand for EVs remains robust.\n\nTesla itself even delivered a record number of vehicles in the third quarter as consumers rushed to take advantage of expiring EV tax credits in the U.S.\n\nEVs are shockingly cheaper to power up, particularly if you charge at home.\n\nIn fact, you could save hundreds of dollars per year. Qmerit offers instant, free installation estimates for Level 2 chargers.\n\nWould you rather have a Tesla or a Corvette?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nReady to maximize your savings associated with driving an EV? Try charging with your own energy rather than relying on the main grid. TCD's Solar Explorer can save you up to $10,000 on solar. EnergySage, one of TCD's Solar Explorer partners, makes it easy to obtain and compare competitive quotes from vetted installers.\n\nAnd whereas gas-powered cars spew toxic pollution responsible for millions of premature deaths every year — not to mention an overheating planet making things more dangerous for humans and pets alike — electric vehicles produce zero tailpipe emissions.\n\nIn the meantime, another Facebook user said they wanted to see a similar feature in other vehicles. Fortunately, multiple manufacturers have stepped up with their own versions of Dog Mode, giving many consumers yet another reason to make their next car an EV.\n\n\"Every car should have this option. So cool!\" the user exclaimed.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "This isn’t the first time Zuckerberg has clashed with neighbors over real estate projects.",
    "fullText": "Billionaire Mark Zuckerberg has been rankling his neighbors in Palo Alto as he works on expanding and modifying the 11 homes that he has purchased in the area. To smooth over tensions, The New York Times says Zuckerberg gifted his next-door neighbors noise-canceling headphones as a peace offering.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, the billionaire cofounder of Facebook and CEO of Meta, reportedly gave noise-canceling headphones to his neighbors in the Crescent Park neighborhood of Palo Alto in an effort to address years of frustration over ongoing construction and disruption surrounding his expanding residential compound, according to The New York Times.\n\nZuckerberg has spent more than $110 million purchasing at least 11 homes on Edgewood Drive and Hamilton Avenue over the past 14 years, transforming this once-idyllic neighborhood of lawyers, business executives, and Stanford University professors into a zone dominated by construction equipment, surveillance, and frequent lavish parties.\n\nSome of these properties that were recently purchased sit unoccupied, despite being in a region known for its acute housing shortage, while others have been converted into guest homes, lush gardens, a pickleball court, a pool with a hydrofloor, and—at least for a time—a private school for Zuckerberg’s children and several others (a use that appears not to comply with local zoning ordinances).\n\nUnderneath the compound, Zuckerberg added 7,000 square feet of space described as “basements,” which to area residents are more akin to “bunkers” or a “billionaire’s bat cave.” Zuckerberg similarly added a 5,000-square-foot underground structure to his compound in Hawaii, which he insists is not a “doomsday bunker.”\n\nMuch of the discontent centers on the nearly eight years of continual construction. Several neighbors cited street blockages, debris, and relentless noise as ongoing issues.\n\nA spokesperson for Mark Zuckerberg provided the following statement to Fortune:\n\n“Mark, Priscilla and their children have made Palo Alto their home for more than a decade. They value being members of the community and have taken a number of steps above and beyond any local requirements to avoid disruption in the neighborhood.”\n\nThe noise-canceling headphones were among several gifts extended by Zuckerberg’s staff to appease neighbors during particularly loud periods, along with bottles of sparkling wine and boxes of Krispy Kreme doughnuts. These gestures, however, have not always been effective. Some of his neighbors say their community has been transformed—and not in a good way—by absentee ownership, strict privacy barriers, and heavy security presence, including cameras overlooking adjacent properties and frequent patrols by private security guards.\n\nMeta didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThis is not Zuckerberg’s first clash with neighbors over real estate projects. In 2016, Palo Alto officials rejected a proposal to demolish four homes and replace them with smaller houses and large basements as part of a wider compound. While the city denied the specific application, Zuckerberg ultimately proceeded gradually, undertaking similar work in a piecemeal fashion to avoid further regulatory hurdles. The Palo Alto City Council and some residents have since criticized what they describe as the exploitation of zoning loopholes and the city’s regulatory inaction.\n\nZuckerberg’s residential portfolio extends far beyond Palo Alto. He owns a 2,300-acre estate in Kauai, Hawaii, where his land acquisitions and building plans have at times provoked local controversy as well. He also owns homes at Lake Tahoe and a mansion in Washington, D.C.\n\nA version of this story was published at Fortune.com on Aug. 26, 2025.\n\nZuckerberg defends Meta’s spending spree, says ‘the risk is higher on the other side’\n\n‘The Social Network’ nailed Mark Zuckerberg’s wardrobe, Facebook founder admits\n\nWhy Mark Zuckerberg says the ‘most important thing’ he built at Harvard was a prank website\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "description": "Aaron Cannon thought up his startup, Outset, while on paternity leave. As his kid has grown up, so has the company.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Aaron Cannon, the 37-year-old founder of Outset, who resides in San Francisco with his wife and three-year-old son. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI decided to start my company while I was on paternity leave.\n\nIt's very woven together: starting a family and starting a startup happened along a similar timeline. I definitely have a lot of people who think that's a little insane. It is. I have wistful moments thinking about, \"Man, what if I could do all this when I was 25 and single?\"\n\nThen I quickly remind myself that I was an idiot when I was 25.\n\nWhen I was on paternity leave, I maybe had too much time to think. When you have a baby, you are all hands on deck physically, but you don't have a lot of intellectual stimulation. I was daydreaming about what I wanted to do with my career.\n\nIt's a very intense balance. \"Work-life balance\" implies a certain degree of chillness. I don't have that. Every minute of my day matters. Everything gets deprioritized except family and work. That's painful. It's really ruthless prioritization.\n\nIt's very weird mentally. In a normal job, you have really intense days, and you come home and you tell your family, \"I've got to take a breather.\" The problem is, every day at my job right now is intense. Our startup is in that crazy growth stage where everything is growing and breaking at the same time.\n\nIf I come home and say, \"Ugh, this is so intense,\" then I'm not going to be as present as a dad. I don't have that option.\n\nYesterday, on the way home, I had an intense call after work. I'm negotiating this contract. Then I pick up my kid, and I spend the next 20 minutes explaining seasons to him. I started with, \"Do you understand what a year is?\" No. Where do you even start? It's a crazy mental shift.\n\nI pick him up every day, which forces a boundary. Thank goodness, my cofounder and I have different lives. He stays later, I come earlier. As long as the two of us are showing up in the way the founders need to, great.\n\nBut I leave. I go and pick up my kid every day from preschool. I take him home. I do dinner. I get him to bed. Then I'm back on for work. Those are a precious couple of hours.\n\nEven if I'm physically present, it is very hard after the most intense day of work to just shut that off. You can set physical world boundaries and still be mentally there or not there. I want to be as deeply engaged as possible.\n\nWe went through Y Combinator back in 2023, and I was definitely on the older side. On Wednesday nights, we had speakers and programs, and that was not easy for me.\n\nBeing a dad provides perspective. It is easy to take any big thing or small thing that's happening and obsess as a founder. You are the company, the company is you. When I get home and have to explain what seasons are, it's a reminder: Why are we doing this? It zooms you out.\n\nIt also helps reinforce my motivations. I want my kid growing up, seeing his dad do a big swing in his career and try something crazy. That's a lesson and an example I want to set for him. You can go build something yourself.\n\nIt's a chapter of my life, but it's not all of my life. It's intense. I should expect it to be that way.\n\nThe most important thing is that I'm present as a dad. I don't get these years back. He's only three for one year.",

He is expected to remain in Palm Beach through January 4.\n\nTake a look at Mar-a-Lago's lavish Christmas celebrations.\n\nThe president flew to Palm Beach on Air Force One after holding a rally in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. First lady Melania Trump did not appear to be traveling with him.\n\nThe golf club is located around 4.5 miles from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nJoined by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Secretary of the Navy John Phelan, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump said that the \"Trump-class\" would eventually include 20 to 25 ships.\n\nPhelan said the first of these ships to be built will be the USS Defiant, an 880-foot-long, heavily armed battleship with a crew of 850. Some of its planned weaponry is still in development, such as the Sea-Launched Cruise Missile-Nuclear, or SLCM-N.\n\nAt the press conference, Trump also addressed the Epstein files for the first time since they were officially released on December 19.\n\nTrump acknowledged that he appeared in photos released by the Justice Department, saying that Epstein \"was all over Palm Beach and other places.\"\n\n\"What this whole thing is with Epstein is a way of trying to deflect from the tremendous success that the Republican Party has,\" he said.\n\nDonald Trump rode through Palm Beach in \"The Beast,\" the armored presidential limousine.\n\nTrump thanked service members for their \"extraordinary devotion and service to America\" and touted his $1,776 \"warrior dividend\" bonus checks sent to military members ahead of Christmas.\n\nTrump moved gold angel statues from the ceiling of Mar-a-Lago's Grand Ballroom to the doorways in the Oval Office, which he has redecorated to more closely resemble the gold-covered walls of his Palm Beach estate.\n\nThat night, Trump shared a holiday message on Truth Social.\n\n\"Merry Christmas to all, including the Radical Left Scum that is doing everything possible to destroy our Country, but are failing badly,\" he wrote.",

    "description": "A recent update from the Department of Education said that just 170 student-loan borrowers received income-driven repayment discharges in November.",
    "fullText": "Thousands of student-loan borrowers are stuck in limbo.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's Department of Education provided an update on the progress it has made in processing student-loan borrowers' income-driven repayment applications in a court filing last week. It seems the department still has a lot of work to do: 802,730 IDR applications are pending as of November 30.\n\nPer the court filing, the department discharged the loans of 170 student-loan borrowers who were on IDR plans in November, with another 280 discharges for borrowers who had completed their payments through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which forgives student debt for government and nonprofit workers after 10 years of qualifying payments.\n\nThe updates are a result of an agreement the Department of Education reached with the American Federation of Teachers, which accused the department in a lawsuit of delaying processing and denying borrowers the relief they're owed.\n\nIn October, the department also said in a court filing in the AFT lawsuit that it would process more forgiveness for borrowers on income-driven repayment plans, appearing to be a commitment to keep working through the backlog. The latest update leaves it uncertain as to how quickly the department intends to process applications and grant relief to borrowers who complete their qualifying number of payments.\n\nBeginning in July 2026, the department is set to begin implementing major repayment changes that Trump signed into law in his \"big beautiful\" spending legislation. These include a new repayment plan, borrowing limits for graduate, professional, and parent loans, and changes to PSLF eligibility.\n\nTax changes are also coming. A 2021 provision in the American Rescue Plan that made student-loan forgiveness tax-free is set to expire in January, meaning that borrowers who reach their qualifying number of payments for relief in 2026 could face thousands of dollars in taxes. The department confirmed, however, that borrowers who reached their payment threshold before 2026 but did not yet have their discharge approved would not face taxes.\n\nStudent-loan borrowers told Business Insider that they're bracing for higher payments next year as a result of the slew of repayment changes, along with uncertainty as to how those changes will play out.\n\n\"My overall general feeling is anxiety and nervousness about it because we really don't know what's going to happen,\" Jennifer Oakes, a 41-year-old borrower, said.",
