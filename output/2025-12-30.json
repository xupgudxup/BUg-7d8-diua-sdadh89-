    "fullText": "The twinned towns of Dull in the highlands and Boring in Oregon have a third sibling today, blunt Edinburgh.\n\nThe second successive defeat by Glasgow Warriors was tedious and, unsurprisingly, the atmosphere in the ground was as flat as a pancake that's been sat on by a tighthead prop.\n\nThe fact that the attendance didn't top last year's number is in part down to potential attendees being sceptical of the ability of Edinburgh to actually make a game of it, let alone put on a spectacle worthy of the time, effort and cost involved to be there.\n\nMore importantly, it could be the final debacle in the Sean Everitt era.\n\nFor context, in the past seasons that Mike Blair, Richard Cockerill and Alan Solomons were in charge not one of them had reached this point of the season with so few points on the board.\n\nIn fact, not once in our professional history have we reached week eight of the league season and won fewer games than we have this year, albeit with one game postponed.\n\nOn the back of this defeat the approach to the game v Castres, also a loss, seems even more ridiculous.\n\nIt has to be acknowledged that injuries have played their part but the back line selected for this game is arguably our best option, even without or increasingly because of Duhan Van der Merwe's absence, and yet not one shot was fired.\n\nThat is now two games in a three-week period where we have failed to score a try. You have to go back to 2016 to find a season with more tryless games.\n\nThe changing of the coach may not be a panacea. But who dictates and implements the culture at a club? Who is responsible for the style of play? Who chooses the players and the supporting coaching staff? We can't change the squad en masse so that leaves one option whether it fits the narrative or not.\n\nEdinburgh need a coach with drive and a sense of purpose because we are rudderless and only our lack of direction is preventing us from running aground entirely.\n\nSandy Smith can be found at The Burgh Watch",

    "description": "What can we expect in the Trojans' final game of the 2025 season?",
    "fullText": "Prior to each USC football game this season, I will be giving five predictions for the contest. With the Trojans playing their final game of the year against TCU in the Alamo Bowl Tuesday night, this marks the season finale of this series.\n\nSo what can we expect when the Trojans and Horned Frogs face off in San Antonio? Here are five predictions for the Alamo Bowl between USC and TCU:\n\nUSC running back King Miller needs 127 yards rushing against TCU to hit 1,000 yards on the season. He does not quite hit that mark, but he does go over 100 yards and score at least one touchdown.\n\nUSC will be without its top two tight ends in the Alamo Bowl with Lake McRee opting out and Walker Lyons entering the transfer portal. Given that USC's remaining tight ends combined for exactly one reception on the season, I am predicting that the unit does not record a single catch against TCU.\n\nTuesday night will mark D'Anton Lynn's final game as USC's defensive coordinator, as he is headed to Penn State afterwards to take the DC job there. Lynn goes out with a bang, as his USC defense holds TCU to 24 or fewer points.\n\nIn today's era of college football with bowl rosters often looking very different from regular season rosters, it is not uncommon to see unlikely heroes emerge. Last year for USC, it was Kyle Ford catching the game-winning touchdown in the final seconds of the Las Vegas Bowl. This year, I am going with Jaden Richardson to finally score his first FBS touchdown in his final college football game.\n\nBowl games typically feature a player of the game award. My final prediction of the season is that quarterback Jayden Maiava earns this honor as he leads the Trojans to their tenth victory of the year.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Trojans Wire: Five predictions as USC football faces TCU in Alamo Bowl",

    "fullText": "The conversations about whether or not Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce will catch another pass from Patrick Mahomes have dominated his retirement rumors. Kelce's in-depth conversation with team legend Tony Gonzalez aired on Prime Sports before last Thursday's Christmas game and addressed multiple topics, including Mahomes.\n\nThe conversation was filmed at Kelce and Patrick Mahomes' 1587 Prime restaurant, with the 11-time Pro Bowler opening up about his friendship with the two-time league MVP.\n\n\"He's (Patrick Mahomes) family now. I think through all the hard work and all the family time that we've had outside the facility and outside the building, there'll definitely never be a goodbye to him, It'll just be like another day in the life with Patty Mahomes.\" said Kelce, \"What he's been to my career up to this point, you can't measure it. It's all the little things that you see manifest out there onto the field that we're working on every single week, every single offseason. When he came into the league, he took this thing by storm. It's been a fun ride ever since he's been at the helm.\"\n\nSince Mahomes became the starting quarterback in 2018, the duo has been inseparable on the field. Their production and chemistry are unmatched, but their future remains murky heading into the offseason, especially after Kelce was asked that question during a recent press conference.\n\n\"That was a harsh reality when I got asked that. I was like, 'Oh man, that's a dark way to look at it.' I think, I don't know, I'll always be able to go out there in the backyard slinging around with the old Texas gunslinger,\" said Kelce, \"But you know that day is going to come. If it's already happened, I can feel pretty content with how many times he's connected on the field with me and how much success and how much fun we've had playing this game.\"\n\nMahomes was in attendance during the Chiefs' Christmas night home finale against the Denver Broncos.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Chiefs TE Travis Kelce opens up about friendship with Patrick Mahomes",

    "description": "Notre Dame football got great news on Monday as head coach Marcus Freeman won’t entertain NFL offers, and here are the top social media reactions.",
    "fullText": "It was a huge Monday for Notre Dame football, as head coach Marcus Freeman turned down the NFL to stay in South Bend.\n\nThere were multiple rumors about teams going after the Irish head coach, especially after the disappointing end to the year with missing the College Football Playoff. In the end, Freeman never reportedly took an interview and will continue his quest to win a championship for Notre Dame.\n\nIt can’t be understated how huge this news is, as Freeman has turned the program into what many thought he couldn’t, a perennial national championship contender. Last year was proof the Irish are close, and hopefully this season is motivation for 2026.\n\nAs social media always does, it was quick to react to the news. Here are some of the top reactions to Notre Dame retaining Marcus Freeman for at least another season.\n\nOn Monday morning, Marcus Freeman informed two NFL franchises that had been in communication with him about their jobs that he was staying at Notre Dame, sources tell Sports Illustrated pic.twitter.com/UHJV3WV7rV\n\n— Sports Illustrated (@SInow) December 29, 2025\n\nInteresting that it was multiple teams that went after Freeman, as it was only really known that the New York Giants were interested. Sports Illustrated’s Pat Forde had at least one other team who saw him as a good fit for their organization.\n\nA win for college football https://t.co/xF2VfL08AE\n\n— J.D. PicKell (@jdpickell) December 29, 2025\n\nCollege football won today, keeping one of its best away from the professional ranks. Notre Dame clearly is the biggest winner here, but this move sends waves across the top-levels of the game.\n\nMarcus Freeman off the market for NFL teams ... https://t.co/hsJrl3gWDa\n\n— Albert Breer (@AlbertBreer) December 29, 2025\n\nWas there ever really a true market for Freeman, anyone could say that they were interested. You have to wonder how he’ll react if he’s asked about this in a future press conference.\n\nSources confirm coach Marcus Freeman will be back at Notre Dame for the 2026 season and will receive an enhanced contract with the school, as athletic director Pete Bevacqua indicated earlier this month. @ByPatForde first reported.\n\n— Adam Rittenberg (@ESPNRittenberg) December 29, 2025\n\nWorth every penny. Give Freeman a blank check. Don’t let him leave South Bend.\n\nTHE GOAT IS BACK LETS RIDE COACH!!! https://t.co/J7BGjfEJZ8\n\n— ☘️ (@WeAreNDFans) December 29, 2025\n\nThis might be a bit of an overreaction, but getting Freeman back is huge for the 2026 season. He’s the driving force behind the program and will have a loaded team next fall.\n\nOn Monday morning, Marcus Freeman informed two NFL teams that had been in contact with him about their head-coaching openings that he’s staying at Notre Dame, sources told Sports Illustrated’s Pat Forde 👀 Natty incoming 2026?\n\n— Talia Baia (@talia_baia) December 29, 2025\n\nGet used to it, as long as Freeman is in South Bend, this is the new normal. Notre Dame should continue to contend for championships and should be one of the few teams that can actually win-it-all next fall.\n\nGreat move by Freeman and ND to shutdown the NFL talk so quickly.\n\nI remember the Brian Kelly to NFL talk after the national championship game run lingered for a long time (Kelly made no secret he was actively interested).\n\nIt really killed our momentum in recruiting & retention.\n\n— G'Irish Talk 🎙️ (@GIrish_Talk) December 29, 2025\n\nWith the transfer portal season coming up, having stability at the head coaching position is huge, and Notre Dame now has that. Players won’t have to worry if Freeman will leave after the window closes, as he’s already announced his return.\n\nI ask myself that every day, but I think his time at Notre Dame is not going to be much longer. Two offseasons in a row he's shown some level of interest in other jobs, mainly in the NFL. Even more so this offseason. If ND is as good as I think they will be in 2026, could be his…\n\n— Bryan Driskell (@CoachD178) December 29, 2025\n\nDriskell is one of the best on the Notre Dame beat, and hopefully his gut is wrong. You can’t deny his read on the situation, it has been back-to-back off-seasons dealing with Freeman potentially heading off to the NFL. Time will tell what ends up happening, but what we know now is that he’ll be coaching Notre Dame next fall.\n\nContact/Follow us @IrishWireND on X (Formerly Twitter), and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Notre Dame news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fighting Irish Wire: Social media reacts to Marcus Freeman staying with Notre Dame for 2026",

    "fullText": "With the Buffalo Bills’ one-point loss on Sunday to the Philadelphia Eagles, the New England Patriots were crowned the champions of the AFC East.\n\nThis snapped a franchise record of five consecutive division championships for Buffalo.\n\nWith this streak snapped, the Bills became owners of a new NFL record.\n\nThe Bills became the first team in NFL history to win five or more consecutive division titles and not make a Super Bowl appearance during their run.\n\nThere are only five other franchises in the Super Bowl era to have ever won their division five or more years in a row.\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings’ “Purple People Eaters” won the NFC Central six seasons in a row, spanning from 1973 to 1978. Like Buffalo, Minnesota has never won a Super Bowl. However, during this time, the Vikings made appearances in 1974, 1975, and 1977.\n\nThen there was the Pittsburgh Steelers’ “Steel Curtain.” This iteration of the Steelers won their division from 1974 to 1979. They appeared in and won four Super Bowls during those six years.\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams held the record for most consecutive divisional titles for 30 years after winning seven in a row starting in 1973. These Rams’ seasons usually ended in a conference championship loss to one of the other teams on this list, but they did manage to make one Super Bowl in the final year of their run.\n\nMost recently, we have the Kansas City Chiefs, whose failure to win the AFC West this season ended their stab at the Patriots’ record. The Chiefs made five Super Bowls during their nine-year reign atop the division, winning three.\n\nBut none compares to New England’s NFL record 11-year division title streak starting in 2009 and ending when Buffalo claimed its first.\n\nThe Patriots appeared in eight straight AFC Conference Championship Games, made five Super Bowl appearances and lifted three Lombardi Trophies.\n\nDrake Maye Boasts ‘It’s Harder To Light Me Up Than You Think’",

    "fullText": "Many players contributed to Auburn basketball's dominating 106-65 win over Queens University in its final nonconference game of the season.\n\nAs a team, Auburn connected on 15 three-pointers, won the rebound battle, 40-26, and recorded 13 steals. The Tigers also shared the wealth by notching 22 assists. Auburn head coach Steven Pearl was encouraged by what he saw out of his team on Monday, especially in the first half.\n\n\"The first half looked like Auburn basketball again, which was encouraging,\" Pearl said. \"Second half, their ball pressure bothered us some. We've got to do a better job with that.\"\n\nAn amazing team effort led to many stellar individual performances. Here is a look at who Auburn Wire writers, as well as Auburn fans, chose as their \"Tiger of the Game\" following Auburn's win over Queens.\n\nHall set the tone of the game by scoring 16 first-half points, going 3-of-5 from three-point and 6-of-9 overall from the field. He scored just two points in the 2nd half, but his first-half efforts helped Auburn establish its dominance early on.\n\nOverton was consistent in Monday's win over Queens. He connected on four field goals in the 1st half to take 13 points into the locker room, and added 10 more points in the 2nd half to finish second in scoring with 23. He was a key piece to Auburn's impressive three-point shooting as he led the team in the category with five makes.\n\nSophomore guard Elyjah Freeman played efficiently on offense for the Tigers. From the beginning, it looked like a night was going to be in the cards for him after a monster dunk off an alley oop from Keyshawn Hall. Freeman shot 9-13 from the field, scored 27 points, and hauled in three rebounds in just 23 minutes. The Tigers could use another offensive piece outside of Hall, Overton, and Pettiford to step up in time for conference play.\n\nAuburn fans have spoken, and Elyjah Freeman is the \"Tiger of the Game\" from Auburn's win over Queens, beating out Kevin Overton, Keyshawn Hall, and Tahaad Pettiford.

    "fullText": "Wisconsin starting quarterback Billy Edwards Jr. is set to enter the NCAA transfer portal when it opens on Friday, according to ESPN's Pete Thamel.\n\nEdwards played in just two games during his one year with the Badgers. The veteran was injured in the team's season opener against Miami (Ohio) on Aug. 28, then returned for just one series during its loss to Maryland on Sept. 20. He attempted only 16 total passes as a Badger, completing seven for 113 total yards and zero touchdowns.\n\nThe veteran began his career at Wake Forest in 2021. He redshirted as a true freshman, then transferred to Maryland in 2022. Edwards would appear in 15 games as a backup in 2022 and 2023, completing 38 of 76 passes for 441 yards, four touchdowns and one interception during that time. He then delivered an excellent season as the starter in 2024, throwing for 2,881 yards, 15 touchdowns and nine interceptions.\n\nEdwards is set to return for his sixth season of college football in 2026. Thamel reports the quarterback is 'expected to receive a medical redshirt and be ready for spring ball.'\n\nWisconsin QB Billy Edwards Jr plans to enter the NCAA transfer portal, he tells ESPN. Edwards is expected to receive a medical redshirt and be ready for spring ball.

Danny O'Neil, who appeared in seven games in relief of Edwards in 2025, is set to return, along with redshirt freshman Carter Smith.

    "fullText": "Inter Milan long-serving stalwart Lautaro Martinez is following in the footsteps of his legendary compatriot Javier Zanetti.\n\nAccording to La Repubblica via FCInterNews, El Toro has become a ‘tattooed’ heir of the iconic Nerazzurri captain.\n\nInter’s decision to sign Lautaro Martinez from Racing Club in 2018 may have been the club’s best piece of business in the past 20 years.\n\nIndeed, the Argentine center-forward has established himself as the symbol of the club during his seven-year stint in Lombardy.\n\nFurthermore, he has never shown any ambition to leave, suggesting he could finish his career at Giuseppe Meazza.\n\nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON – JUNE 21: Lautaro Martinez #10 of FC Internazionale Milano looks on during the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 group E match between FC Internazionale Milano and Urawa Red Diamonds at Lumen Field on June 21, 2025 in Seattle, Washington. (Photo by Buda Mendes/Getty Images)\n\nLautaro’s winning goal against Atalanta on Sunday extended his goals tally for the club to a jaw-dropping 166.\n\nTherefore, he’s now Inter’s fourth all-time leading goalscorer, trailing Roberto Boninsegna by five.\n\nAt 28, Lautaro can still play at the top level for at least half a decade.\n\nWith that in mind, it’s only reasonable to expect the skilled striker to hit a 200-goal landmark.\n\nAlready now, it’s hard to escape the proposition that Lautaro is a modern-day Zanetti figure – a captain defined not just by longevity, but by loyalty.",

    "description": "Will the ax fall on Kevin Stefanski, Mike McDaniel or Shane Steichen? We'll know the day after the 2025 NFL regular season wraps.",
    "fullText": "For 18 teams, the 2026 NFL season begins once Week 18 ends. For a select few, that means leaving losing coaches behind and starting fresh. While there are always a handful of firings across the course of the season — this year that included Tennessee Titans play-caller Brian Callahan and New York Giants former NFL coach of the year Brian Daboll — there's no worse day to be a struggling NFL coach than the day after the season is finished.\n\nBlack Monday is the scourge of underperforming playbook architects. It will claim a handful of careers to ring in the new year January 5, opening the door to coaching interviews and new hires that will energize fan bases across the world — though whether that's a good thing or bad thing will hinge heavily on the candidate. So who could be the recipient of bad headlines the first day after the 2025 NFL regular season ends?\n\nGlenn should be at the top of this list, but New York's reported insistence it will keep him suggests he's safe barring an absolute disaster in Week 18. We cannot rule this out, because absolute disaster has been a hallmark of Glenn's first season as an NFL head coach.\n\nHe started his tenure with seven straight losses. Somehow, the four-game losing streak in which he's currently mired feels worse; his Jets have been outscored by an average margin of just under 27 points per game — and that includes showdowns with sub-.500 teams like the Dolphins and New Orleans Saints. Injuries and trades have depleted both sides of the ball, but you'd be hard pressed to find anything New York does well in 2025.\n\nJustin Fields, Glenn's flier QB addition, has been either injured or terrible this fall. Garrett Wilson's injury turned the receiving corps into a host of replacement-caliber players. None of the team's three starting wideouts in Week 17 began their season on the Jets' active roster. Sauce Gardner and Quinnen Williams were traded in-season. Qwan'tez Stiggers, Dean Clark and Jarvis Brownlee have all made multiple starts in the secondary — a group that has yet to record an interception this fall.\n\nKeeping Glenn suggests owner Woody Johnson is chalking a brutal 2025 up to an undermanned depth chart and some bad personnel decisions. Still, it's tough to look at the Jets defense and its massive regression from Robert Saleh's peak and think Glenn has the ability to map out a cogent plan as the season wears on and the world changes around him.\n\nHe's set to get another try with multiple first round draft picks and more than $90 million in salary cap room for 2026. Failing there could set the Jets up for another generation of regret.\n\nStefanski is Cleveland's Sisyphus, only if management stepped in to give him a larger, heavier boulder after he'd cleared the halfway point of his mountain. The coach who guided Baker Mayfield to the franchise's first playoff win since 1994 and won 11 games by making Joe Flacco the NFL comeback player of the year (in just six games) has been constantly hamstrung by his franchise's inability to find a viable quarterback.\n\nCleveland traded three first round picks before handing Deshaun Watson a fully guaranteed $230 million despite more than 20 accusations of sexual misconduct and what the NFL itself described as \"predatory behavior\" dating to his time in Houston. For the privilege of blocking the team's most obvious pathways to roster improvement, Watson has played 19 games in four seasons and been the NFL's 48th-best quarterback when on the field.\n\nHis absence has cleared the way for the Browns to improve from 32nd in scoring offense last season to... 31st. The offensive line, once a strength, has devolved into one of the league's worst units. Bright spots remain thanks to Quinshon Judkins and Harold Fannin Jr., but there may not be a coach alive or dead who could coax this team to a respectable record.\n\nAfter that playoff win in his debut, Stefanski has had a losing record in four of the last five seasons. He deserves better. Cleveland firing him could clear him up to actually receive it. Expecting the Browns to do better with his replacement, however, is a tough ask.\n\nMorris got the Atlanta job over Bill Belichick. While he's been better (and less of a circus) than the nine-time Super Bowl winner has at North Carolina, he hasn't inspired confidence. Somehow, remarkably, Morris found a way to beat the Buffalo Bills but lose to the New York Jets — threading a needle that completes the world's tackiest jacket.\n\nQuarterback play has been an issue, with Michael Penix Jr.'s injury giving way to a diminished Kirk Cousins and spurts of inspiring play cropping up like islands in a sea of mediocrity. Atlanta has a galaxy of high level skill players, but thanks to injury and ineffectiveness ranks only 22nd in expected points added (EPA) per play this fall. Pouring draft capital into the pass rush has improved the defense, but that unit has gone from 20th in EPA allowed to... 19th.\n\nOutside help will be difficult to find. Releasing or trading Cousins would shave up to $35 million from the team's 2026 salary cap — useful, considering it's already over the estimated spending limit next fall — but may not be practical with Penix recovering from his third ACL tear. The team's first round pick is owed to the Los Angeles Rams as a result of the trade that made James Pearce a Falcon (he was drafted with the 26th overall selection. Atlanta's pick is shaping up to land in or around the top 10. It's not ideal!).\n\nThat could give Morris one more chance to clean up the mess he's maintained for the past two seasons. If he can fix the defense and lean on guys like Drake London and Bijan Robinson on offense, it could be enough to rise to the top of the NFC South's shallow pool. The help will have to mostly come from within the franchise. With a still-young core, the opportunity for a turnaround will persist. So far, Morris has proven incapable of seizing it.\n\nHow much of the Colts' injury-related crashout will be heaped at the feet of Steichen and general manager Chris Ballard? Indianapolis was once 7-1. Now it's at risk of finishing 2025 with a losing record.\n\nSteichen and Ballard came into the year on the hot seat, emerged as potential award winners over the first half of the season and then shrank from the spotlight as things went sour. Injuries to Daniel Jones and Anthony Richardson didn't help, but that doesn't explain a defense that ranked 10th in expected points added (EPA) per play allowed in the first half of the season slid to 23rd in the second half. Sure, a rise of three-and-outs from an offense eventually commandeered by a 44-year-old Philip Rivers didn't help. Even so, that's a dramatic backslide for a team that held three opponents to 14 points or fewer through Week 8 and has held a single opponent to fewer than 20 points in the nine weeks since.\n\nThe Colts are heading into their first full offseason without former owner Jim Irsay at the helm in four decades. Current principal owner Carlie Irsay-Gordon and her sisters have been raised in a football world and understand the big swings he took to make Indianapolis great for a long stretch (and bad-to-mediocre for a longer one). Would they opt for a clean break to start fresh this January? Or did Jones' revival and subsequent injury create enough plausible deniability to run it back next fall?\n\nInjury luck has been unkind to Gannon, certainly. But it doesn't excuse the fact he's won 30 percent of his games in Arizona over nearly three full seasons. With Kyler Murray shut down for the season (officially due to a foot injury, but unofficially because he was uninspiring and lacked the efficiency and consistency of, big sigh, Jacoby Brissett), the Cardinals have lost eight straight games. Despite a 3-13 record, they may not wind up with a top-three draft pick from it thanks to the league's hardest strength of schedule.\n\nEven without a top-two pick in a two-quarterback draft (we'll see how the spring workouts shake out for Ty Simpson et al), we may have seen the end of the Murray era in Arizona. The former first overall pick has played more than 11 games only once in his last four seasons. His 0.084 EPA per dropback ranks 23rd among 53 quarterbacks to play at least 500 snaps in that stretch, which isn't terrible but also hasn't resulted in success. The Cardinals haven't had a winning season since 2021.\n\nTrading away Murray would create more than $35 million in salary cap savings and a clean slate for a team unable to get out of its own way. Would Arizona trust a new franchise quarterback to the head coach who engineered a top-three offense in Philadelphia to get the job, then built the league's 17th-best offense in the three years that followed? While Gannon coaxed another forgettably solid year out of Brissett, his lack of wins suggests the ceiling for another veteran QB wouldn't be much higher in 2026.\n\nMcDaniel has been able to make more from less, turning around a team that looked absolutely cooked to start the season (1-6) en route to a .500-ish record. That's happened without Tyreek Hill in the lineup and followed the benching of Tua Tagovailoa. Rookie seventh round pick Quinn Ewers may not be the team's future, but McDaniel installed an offense around him that allowed him to beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 17 to further dim the Bucs' Super Bowl hopes.\n\nThat's all encouraging. It does not change the fact McDaniel failed to make Tagovailoa more than a fantasy football star, an 0-2 playoff record or a 9-14 record in December or later. The unconventional head coach has done a great job adding a slick layer of sheen atop his franchise that begins to flake apart under modest scrutiny. He's had one season with a top 20 scoring defense. He hasn't cracked the top 20 in scoring offense either of the last two years.\n\nLike Gannon above, McDaniel's franchise is on the verge of swapping out a once-touted, highly paid and since-benched quarterback in service of a fresh start. But Tagovailoa's contract, injury history and the smoldering crater his 2025 play created makes him considerably more difficult to trade and there's nearly $100 million worth of dead salary attached to the $212 million extension he signed in (deep exhale) 2024. Miami isn't bad enough to land a top prospect on an inexpensive salary in the draft. Its best option may be hoping for a Sam Darnold or Baker Mayfield-type revival from a journeyman veteran.\n\nThat could benefit McDaniel, who supercharged Tagovailoa just long enough to be an albatross around the team's neck and just won a game with a seventh round rookie behind center. McDaniel's place in Kyle Shanahan's coaching tree suggests a special appreciation for getting the most out of flawed passers. But four seasons of underwhelming returns and no playoff success to speak of may shuffle him back to the coordinator ranks for a few years instead.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: 6 NFL coaches on the hot seat for Black Monday",

    "fullText": "New York Giants interim head coach Mike Kafka offered glowing praise for rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart on Monday, declaring unequivocally that the young signal-caller has already established himself as the team's franchise quarterback.\n\n\"I don't have any doubts about that,\" Kafka said when asked if he believes Dart is a legitimate NFL franchise quarterback.\n\nDart, who entered the season as the backup before taking over as a starter, has impressed Kafka with his natural leadership that extends beyond the offense.\n\n\"I've seen Jaxson just become more comfortable in that role,\" Kafka said. \"It's not about forcing anything, it's just about being himself and leading the way that he sees it and bringing guys along with him. Those are the qualities that we've seen since the first day he's gotten here.\"\n\nKafka noted that Dart's influence has reached the defense, with players there citing his leadership.\n\n\"I don't think there's an age requirement for leadership, whether you're young or old or a veteran or one year or one month or however many,\" Kafka said. \"I just think if you have the leadership qualities, if you have the ability to, number one, lead yourself and then lead others, and guys will follow you based on how you operate and how you carry yourself, then I don't think there's necessarily like a prerequisite for that.\n\n\"I mean, Jaxson does a great job because he's just being himself and he's controlling what he can control. He's doing all the things that make him great and he's just being himself. He's not trying to be somebody else. He's just his genuine self.\"\n\nOn Dart's development, Kafka highlighted the typical leap from Year 1 to Year 2.\n\n\"I think you learn so much faster from year one to year two. You have that full season, you're in the NFL style, you kind of know how things operate. You've built somewhat of a framework of a routine on how you want to prepare yourself,\" he said. \"Now you have time after this season to go through, kind of refine the things that you want, how you want to operate in the offseason, and now you have some time to kind of look back and really dissect yourself and really can make some more steps to improvement.\"\n\nKafka, who has coached Dart since his rookie arrival, called him \"a pleasure to coach.\"\n\n\"He's been awesome. Learning every single day, absorbing as much information as he can, and then also putting his own fingerprint on things,\" he said. \"You see a player that's continuing to learn from the good, the bad, and then continuing to take steps forward... take ownership and take accountability and hold other guys accountable.\"\n\n\"I'm proud to be working with him and happy for him, and I'm excited to continue to do that,\" Kafka concluded.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Giants' Mike Kafka doesn't 'have any doubt' Jaxson Dart is a franchise QB",

(Photo by Bryn Lennon/Getty Images)\n\nThe same goes for Jean-Philippe Mateta, a long-time Milan target, but Crystal Palace are unwilling to sell for less than €40m.\n\nMauro Icardi and  Joshua Zirkzee have Serie A experience and might be allowed to leave in January, but only in the second half of the month, as Galatasaray and Manchester United are short of options in attack due to the AFCON.\n\nLast but not least is Rayan of Vasco Da Gama. The Brazilian is not exactly a centre-forward as he prefers playing as a winger or as an attacking winger.\n\nDespite having an €80m release clause, he might leave for a lower fee because the Brazilian club are in a poor financial situation, but the competition for the 19-year-old will be fierce.",

    "fullText": "Liverpool have parted ways with first-team set-piece coach Aaron Briggs as the Premier League champions move to address a persistent weakness that has undermined their performances this season.\n\nThe decision follows mounting frustration inside the club over Liverpool’s record at dead-ball situations, which has been among the poorest in the division despite their continued strength in open play.\n\nSet pieces have proven costly for Arne Slot’s side, with Liverpool conceding 12 goals from such situations in the Premier League, more than any other top-flight team when penalties are excluded.\n\nOnly West Ham United have conceded more goals from corners, while Liverpool have allowed seven from that specific source alone.\n\nAt the other end of the pitch, their returns have been similarly underwhelming, with Liverpool scoring just 2.4 goals per 100 set pieces, a figure bettered only by Brentford from the wrong end of the scale.\n\nIn terms of defensive output, Liverpool are conceding 8.2 goals per 100 set pieces, with only Nottingham Forest posting a worse average.\n\nThose issues have repeatedly altered the course of matches, most recently against Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers, when Liverpool led comfortably before conceding from set pieces and being forced into tense finishes.\n\nBriggs joined Liverpool’s coaching staff in July 2024, initially as an individual development coach following the departure of Vitor Matos, before assuming responsibility for set pieces after the club were unable to appoint a specialist.\n\nThe appointment was adjusted last summer when Brazilian coach Luiz Fernando Iubel arrived as individual lead coach, allowing Briggs to focus solely on dead-ball situations, but the changes failed to produce the desired improvement.\n\nDespite his reputation as a diligent and respected coach, Liverpool concluded that a change was required midway through the campaign, although the club do not view his departure as a complete solution to the problem.\n\nThere is no immediate replacement lined up, with Briggs’ duties set to be shared among existing members of Slot’s coaching staff in the short term.\n\nBriggs arrived at Anfield after working under Niko Kovac at Wolfsburg and previously held senior analytical and coaching roles at Monaco.\n\nHe also spent nine years at Manchester City, progressing from under-18 performance analyst to a senior first-team role, with earlier experience at Blackpool and Preston North End.",

Then he will get even more balls, be allowed to take free kicks and penalties, as he was allowed to do at Bayer and is allowed to do in the national team,\" Matthäus said.\n\nMatthäus said he wasn't surprised that Wirtz needs time to adapt at Anfield and expressed confidence that he will deliver.\n\n\"He has the right attitude and his playing ability is undisputed, just as his desire to succeed together with the team. I am convinced that he will forge ahead,\" Matthäus said.",

    "fullText": "Barcelona returned to training yesterday after a short festive break, and the mood around the squad is one of focus rather than celebration.\n\nWith momentum on their side, the challenge now is to carry that form into what promises to be one of the most demanding starts to a calendar year in recent memory.\n\nTo put the scale of the challenge into context, the team will not play a single match at home until the end of January.\n\nIn fact, Barça’s first six fixtures of the new year will all be away from home, a schedule that leaves little room for error.\n\nTheir competitive return begins with a derby against Espanyol on January 3 and just days later, Barcelona travel again for the Spanish Super Cup semi-final against Athletic Club on January 7.\n\nThe month continues with another difficult league assignment away to Real Sociedad on January 18, followed by a UEFA Champions League clash against Slavia Prague on January 21.\n\nBarcelona have a tough run of games in January. (Photo by Angel Martinez/Getty Images)\n\nTwo additional fixtures could further complicate the schedule, notably, a potential Super Cup final on January 11 and a Copa del Rey round of 16 tie, scheduled between January 13 and 15.\n\nThe first match of 2026 at the Spotify Camp Nou will not arrive until the weekend of January 24–25, when Real Oviedo pay a visit. This would be a match where Camp Nou could host a bigger audience.\n\nBarcelona will eventually close January with another home fixture, which is the final Champions League group match against Copenhagen on January 28.\n\nThere is, however, one big concern. Almost all of Barcelona’s defeats this season have come away from home.\n\nAside from the 1–2 loss to Paris Saint-Germain, every setback has occurred on the road, including league defeats to Sevilla and Real Madrid, as well as a Champions League loss to Chelsea.\n\nThis is why January represents a defining moment.",

    "fullText": "New England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye is the odds-on favorite to win the NFL MVP in just his second year in the league.\n\nAs such, fans would probably like to see his role blocking in the run game diminish. However, the first-year captain is beginning to make a habit of throwing a block.\n\nThe quarterback told the “WEEI Afternoons” crew in a previous radio spot that he was not proud of his blocking efforts.\n\nHe was asked the same question on Monday, and Maye did his best to calm the nerves of anxious fans.\n\n“Yeah, I don’t know what do y’all think?” Maye asked. “I thought I was alright, got in the way enough.”\n\nThe host then asked if Maye is ever worried that one of the opposing defenders is going to “light you up.”\n\n“I mean, I’m 230 pounds, 6’5″, I think it’s a little harder to light me up than you think,” Maye said.\n\n\"I'm 230 pounds, 6'5. I think it's a little harder to light me up than you think\"\n\nPatriots quarterback Drake Maye isn't worried about getting lit up when he is throwing blocks 👀 pic.twitter.com/ClTIme7fbo\n\n— WEEI (@WEEI) December 29, 2025\n\nEven with four more starts made this season, Maye has yet to meet his rushing yardage mark from his rookie year, when he scampered for 421 yards on just 54 carries.\n\nThere was an offseason emphasis placed on protecting the 23-year-old gunslinger after he took several hard hits as a rookie, and it has paid off so far.\n\nThe quarterback says he feels more vulnerable in the pocket than he does throwing blocks.\n\n“When I see the guys coming, I gotta good gist,” Maye said. “But when I’m standing there with the football like a statue, it’s a little easier for those guys to take me off my feet.”\n\nThis Concerning Stat Puts Bills’ AFC East ‘Dynasty’ In Perspective",

One lucky fan in attendance will also receive £60,000 from the tournament sponsor, as will Prostate Cancer UK.\n\nWhat is dartitis and what causes it?\n\nLittler entered as favourite off the back of winning six major finals in 2025.\n\nLuke Humphries, Littler's predecessor as both world champion and world number one, faced Littler in three finals this year and is the current world number two.\n\nWorld number three Michael van Gerwen is also in the mix, looking to avenge last year's final defeat and add to his three world titles, with his most recent coming in 2019.\n\nYoung players making a big run at the World Championship include Josh Rock and Gian van Veen, whose respective form saw them both enter the world's top 12 before the tournament.\n\nBeau Greaves topped this year's Women's Series and carried the highest hopes of becoming only the second female player to win a match in the tournament, after Fallon Sherrock won twice at the event in December 2019.\n\nShe took 22nd seed Daryl Gurney to a deciding set but just fell short of a place in the second round.\n\nThree qualification places were on offer from the Women's Series, along with a spot for the Women's Matchplay winner, a title taken by Lisa Ashton.\n\nAshton lost 3-0 to 2023 world champion Michael Smith in the first round on 11 December.\n\nWith Greaves qualifying in her own right as runner-up on the development tour, that meant Women's Series runner-up Sherrock, Noa-Lynn van Leuven in fourth and Gemma Hayter, who finished fifth, joined third-placed Ashton.\n\nVan Leuven, who became the first transgender player to appear at the tournament last year, was beaten by two-time champion Peter Wright this time.\n\nSherrock lost in straight sets in the first round to Dave Chisnall, while Hayter took a set off Northern Ireland's World Cup winner Rock in a 3-1 defeat.\n\nThe format is set play, unlike other tournaments which are a race to a number of legs.\n\nA set consists of the best of five legs or race to three.\n\nOnly in matches where players are level on sets and legs in the deciding set do players need to win by two clear legs.\n\nFirst and second round: Best of five sets\n\nThird and fourth round: Best of seven sets\n\nQuarter-finals: Best of nine sets\n\nPhil Taylor is the most successful player in the history of the PDC World Darts Championship, winning 14 of his 16 world titles between 1995 and 2013.\n\nHis previous two titles came before a group of leading players broke away from the British Darts Organisation to form their own governing body, now known as the PDC, in 1993.\n\nThe past five years have produced five different world champions, with English trio Littler, Humphries and Smith winning the past three.\n\nLittler and Humphries will hope to join the exclusive club of players to have won multiple PDC world titles, with only six managing to achieve that feat so far.\n\nTwo players hit nine-darters during the 2025 World Darts Championship.\n\nDutchman Christian Kist was the first player to hit one, doing so in a first-round defeat by Madars Razma.\n\nAustralia's Damon Heta hit one in the third round, but like Kist it came in a defeat as he went out to Luke Woodhouse.\n\nThroughout the tournament, there will be daily round-ups on the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nThere will also be live text coverage of the biggest matches as the tournament progresses.\n\nDuring Thursday's opening night, there was a dedicated preview show on BBC Radio 5 Live, featuring interviews with Littler, Humphries and Van Gerwen. Presenter James Gregg will provide updates on BBC Sounds throughout the competition.\n\nThis article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.\n\nAsk Me Anything is a service dedicated to answering your questions.\n\nWe want to reward your time by telling you things you do not know and reminding you of things you do.\n\nThe team will find out everything you need to know and be able to call upon a network of contacts including our experts and pundits.\n\nWe will be answering your questions from the heart of the BBC Sport newsroom, and going behind the scenes at some of the world's biggest sporting events.\n\nOur coverage will span the BBC Sport website, app, social media and YouTube accounts, plus BBC TV and radio.\n\nHow do darts world rankings work?\n\nWho is Arsenal teenager Salmon?\n\nWhy is Steve Smith wearing black tape under his eyes?\n\nWhen is the FA Cup third round draw?",

Milan, on the other hand, will only discuss a permanent transfer for Nkunku.\n\nMILAN, ITALY – SEPTEMBER 23: Christopher Nkunku of AC Milan inflates a balloon as he celebrates with teammates after scoring to give the side a 2-0 lead during the Coppa Italia Frecciarossa Round of 16 match between AC Milan and US Lecce at Giuseppe Meazza Stadium on September 23, 2025 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Jonathan Moscrop/Getty Images)\n\nFenerbahce would need to convince Nkunku as well, given that several sources, including Ben Jacobs and Gianluca Di Marzio, say that the ex-Chelsea forward wants to stay at Milan next month, having joined the Serie A giants only a few months ago.",

    "description": "FaZe Clan's influencer exodus exposes a key risk for creator-economy companies that rely directly on talent to make money.",
    "fullText": "The creator economy gives, and it can also take — suddenly. That's one lesson behind the abrupt exodus of talent from the esports and marketing company FaZe Clan last week.\n\nBuilding a business led by an influencer or celebrity can make you a boatload of money. Just ask the teams behind Kim Kardashian's Skims or George Clooney's Casamigos tequila, which both crossed $1 billion in value.\n\nBut starting a company where the product you're selling is the influencer — such that you make money primarily from their social-media reach, content, or ability to do brand deals — can be risky.\n\nIf a YouTuber or TikTok creator loses popularity due to a scandal or a sudden algorithm change, the revenue dries up. If they become burned out from posting or simply decide they no longer want to work with an intermediary company, then poof!\n\nThat's the situation FaZe Clan appears to have found itself in this week after all six creators its website listed as its talent roster announced they were leaving the company in separate posts on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nCompany investor Matt Kalish, who cofounded DraftKings, told Bloomberg that the current financial structure of FaZe Clan is \"unsustainable\" and he had offered talent the option to go independent or sign deals with his company, HardScope, which they declined.\n\nFaZe Clan acknowledged the departures in its own post on X, writing that \"this era of FaZe\" had \"come to a close.\" With its most famous talent gone and their millions of followers in tow, the company is leaning into its esports business that makes money from league participation, player transfer fees, and IP licensing.\n\nFounded in 2010, FaZe Clan started as a group of friends who enjoyed making gaming videos. The group amassed millions of fans and began making revenue through brand deals. FaZe Clan went public in 2022, sharing in investor filings that it pulled in tens of millions of dollars in revenue from brand sponsorships and other advertising tied to its content. Other business lines, such as consumer products or esports, represented a smaller piece of the pie.\n\nFaZe Clan, when it was still reporting its revenue sources as a public company in 2022 and 2023, relied heavily on brand deals and YouTube ads to make money.\n\nFaZe Clan's stock plummeted in value during its first year trading on the Nasdaq. After cutting about 20% of its staff in early 2023, the company sold itself to gaming and marketing firm GameSquare in March 2024. GameSquare later sold FaZe Clan's media business in multiple transactions to Kalish and others, while retaining the esports business.\n\nThe sudden departure of FaZe's creators — and its struggle in recent years — highlights a key risk that should keep any creator-economy CEO up at night. Being overly reliant on specific creators or revenue sources can be a ticking time bomb.\n\nThe solution: diversify, diversify, diversify.\n\nFaZe Clan, GameSquare, and HardScope did not respond to requests for comment.",

    "fullText": "Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol wants his cafés to feel like Central Perk from the TV show 'Friends.'\n\nDuring an interview with The Wall Street Journal, released Monday, Niccol spoke about his \"Back to Starbucks\" plan, a yearlong process of turning around the brand after several quarters of declining sales amid a deteriorating customer experience.\n\nHe told Alan Murray, president of The WSJ Leadership Institute, that the name \"Back to Starbucks\" helped to give his baristas a \"visual understanding\" of the café experience he was trying to achieve.\n\n\"Because everybody remembers a 'Friends' episode, or that coffee house experience, by me saying 'Back to Starbucks,' that kind of hearkens that memory of what I would call the barista-customer connection that we're after,\" Niccol said.\n\nThe coffee shop from the 'Friends,' Central Perk, was a pivotal set piece throughout the sitcom's 10-season run. Almost every episode featured the café as the characters' favorite haunt.\n\nThe cast was often filmed sitting on Central Perk's mismatched sofas and chairs, ordering coffee and baked goods, and making small talk with the awkward manager, Gunther.\n\nNiccol's comparison of Central Perk to Starbucks comes after he spent more than a year rebranding Starbucks, from what customers and employees said was a soulless conglomerate chain, to a warm and inviting third place. He took the top job in September 2024.\n\nHe simplified the menu, introduced more seating and tables in the cafés, offered free coffee and tea refills, brought back the condiment station and ceramic mugs, and encouraged baristas to write small notes on coffee cups to interact with their customers.\n\nHowever, its sales have yet to see a strong recovery. It reported a 1% increase in its global comparable sales for the fourth quarter of this year, compared to the same period last year. Its stock price is down more than 6% since the start of the year.",

    "description": "Doctors are seeing colon cancer in people in their 20s and 30s. New research suggests it starts in infancy.",
    "fullText": "Five years ago, Tim Cannon, a cancer doctor in Virginia, saw that his colon cancer patients were getting younger and their cancer was more aggressive. He had just diagnosed three people in their 30s with late-stage colon cancer. More perplexing, all three were athletes who competed in long-distance, endurance sports.\n\n\"Within a six-month period, I saw three extreme athletes in their 30s with metastatic, very advanced, incurable colon cancer,\" Cannon told Business Insider.\n\nCannon had a hunch that this pattern wasn't an anomaly. He examined 100 more long-distance runners between 35 and 50 years old and found that 39 had developed precancerous tumors in their colons. Fifteen of those cases were advanced — far more than the expected 1.2%. Nearly one-sixth of all the runners were at risk of developing colon cancer. It was startling.\n\nCannon's research, which is still in its early stages, points to broader questions that have confounded the medical community: Why are so many young, fit adults getting sick and dying from colon and rectal cancer? And why are these patients — people who are younger than 45, the age at which screening is first recommended — getting the most aggressive forms of the disease?\n\n\"The steepest rise is in people in their 20s and 30s,\" said Dr. Kimmie Ng, director of Dana-Farber's Young-Onset Colorectal Cancer Center. \"They're younger, they're healthier, they don't have comorbidities, they get more treatment — and yet they're not living longer.\"\n\nIn January, Business Insider reported on the leading scientific theories for why people with clean diets get colon cancer. Possible answers ranged from microplastics to antibiotics. Leading theories generally pinpointed the modern diet, including too much sugar, and other facts of modern life, like staring into the blue light of our phones late at night, which can disrupt our natural rhythms.\n\nThese factors are likely part of the picture, oncologists say. But there's more to explore. Clusters of early-onset cancers like the one that Cannon says he identified are helping us gain a better understanding of the disease — and some answers for what ordinary people can do about it.\n\nCancer researchers are discovering how different environmental factors interact with our systems in complex ways and at different points of our development.\n\nAnd they're increasingly zeroing in on the first year of life — from birth itself to our first months out of the womb — for answers about young cancer.\n\nSome early research is scratching at the idea that a vulnerability to colorectal cancer could start in infancy — suggesting the first months and years of life could be a key window for intervention.\n\nAt UC San Diego, molecular biologist Ludmil Alexandrov recently identified a mutational signature in more than half of colorectal tumors found in patients under 40 that appears to be caused by colibactin, a toxin produced by a specific strain of E. coli.\n\nWhat startled researchers was the timing of the damage. Cancer researchers typically find DNA damage building up in the adult body. Smoking, grilling meats, work like mining or asbestos-spraying — these well-trodden cancer triggers are typically ignited when our DNA is already becoming more decrepit and unstable, with time and age.\n\nHere — according to the paper Alexandrov published in Nature in April — the infection had occurred before babies reached their ninth month of life.\n\nAlexandrov's research, while preliminary, suggests infants can be hit with DNA mutations just months into their lives that might leave them predisposed to developing cancer within a few decades.\n\n\"You get your first hit at age 1 instead of age 30,\" Alexandrov said. \"So you are about 20 to 30 years ahead of schedule for cancer.\"\n\n\"Something that happened at age 6 months,\" Alexandrov added, \"you don't even consider when you're 35.\"\n\n\"That disconnect is extremely problematic.\"\n\nIf Alexandrov's finding is confirmed in bigger studies, it could reframe the mystery of early-onset colorectal cancer. The rise could be rooted in early life, with early adulthood simply being the point at which the long incubation period finally comes to a head.\n\nIf colibactin infections are a major early trigger, the most effective strategy may be preventing that mutational DNA damage in the first place. The next generation of cancer prevention may involve targeted microbial restoration and dietary strategies designed for an infant's developing immune system. Alexandrov envisions targeted probiotics for infants that neutralize colibactin-producing bacteria.\n\n\"If we can monitor the mutations and see that the ones exposed to the probiotic don't appear,\" he said, it could mean \"we're eliminating the cause.\"\n\nNg says Alexandrov's findings \"cement a role of the microbiome in this disease.\"\n\nShifts in how babies eat, including more ultra-processed food and fewer fiber-rich ingredients, could drive up colibactin infection rates.\n\nWhile researchers suspect that colibactin infections in infants have been on the rise in recent decades, there isn't enough data yet to say for sure. More study is also needed to confirm the link of any such rise to colon cancer.\n\nIt's not just diet that could be playing a role in the rise. Researchers are also looking at shifting trends in how babies are born.\n\nOur first moments of life are a pivotal training ground for the gut — a baby's welcome party to our diverse world of bacteria, fungi, and viruses.\n\nBabies born vaginally pass through the birth canal and pick up critical microbial communities from their mothers — microbes that help train the immune system. C-section babies start life with different microbes, and the evidence is mounting that these early differences may have an impact.\n\n\"There is strong evidence that early-life microbial disruption can influence long-term health risk,\" said Dr. Maria Gloria Domínguez-Bello, a professor at Rutgers University who has pioneered infant microbiome research and looked at the links between an infant's microbiome and their risk for adult diseases, including IBS, ulcerative colitis, and colon cancer.\n\nShe noted that modern changes to birth and feeding practices may lead to subtle yet consequential disruptions to the microbiome.\n\nIn 2016, Domínguez-Bello launched a landmark study on \"vaginal seeding\" — taking babies born via C-section and coating them with bacteria from the mother's vaginal canal. It will be years before we know the effectiveness of this approach, but the hope is that this small intervention may have bolstered their microbiome from day one.\n\nBreastfeeding is one of the ways infants acquire early protective microbes. Breastmilk is packed with complex sugars — human milk oligosaccharides — that babies' gut bacteria can feed on, shaping the early immune system. It can also contain traces of what the mother ingests or has been exposed to.\n\nMultiple large-scale studies have found that the gut bacteria of formula-fed babies tend to differ from those of breastfed babies. While questions remain, this research is reshaping the infant formula market.\n\nCompanies like Biomilq and Helaina are developing \"microbiome-friendly\" formulas that contain synthetic versions of the complex sugars found in breastmilk. Early clinical trials show these products can nudge a baby's gut bacteria to look more breastfed, though whether that matters decades later remains unknown. Still, these formulas have become one of the fastest-growing segments of the infant nutrition industry.\n\nConsuming too much sugar is emerging as a key culprit that may be shaping what happens to our microbiome.\n\nNg's group has found that sugary diets — especially sugary drinks including soda, juice, and sports drinks — are associated with a higher risk of early-onset colon cancer. Food that spikes insulin or glucose \"is linked with a higher risk of colorectal cancer,\" too, she said.\n\nDr. Andrea Cercek at Memorial Sloan Kettering noticed something else: Among her youngest patients with stage 4 cancer, sugar consumption stood out. \"There were slight differences in risk factors — and sugars in particular,\" Cercek said. The idea aligns with prior studies showing that fructose can accelerate polyp growth in animal models.\n\nIt doesn't mean sugar \"causes\" cancer. But modern, ultra-high levels of sugar intake may be accelerating disease in people whose risk was primed early. And they're crowding out what people once used to balance out sugar's effect on the body, improving blood sugar and aiding digestion at the same time: fiber.\n\nSugar can be great for a quick burst of energy, but in the long run, we need fiber to slow it down and promote good gut health. This is especially true of resistant starch (beans, lentils, oats), the type that ferments in the gut and produces short-chain fatty acids that suppress inflammation.\n\nDr. Stephen O'Keefe, who studies Alaska Native communities with historically high colorectal cancer rates, recently found that adding a resistant starch supplement to people's diets for just four weeks had measurable effects.\n\n\"The supplementation did suppress cancer biomarkers,\" he said, discussing the findings he presented to colleagues at Digestive Disease Week 2025.\n\n\"A high fiber diet produces metabolites that suppress colon cancer risk,\" he said. \"A high saturated meat diet produces metabolites that are inflammatory and carcinogenic.\"\n\nHe's seen this kind of thing before, noting important, negative microbial changes occurred quite rapidly when he fed rural, bean-eating South Africans typical American foods like hamburgers and hash browns for two weeks.\n\nO'Keefe believes increasing fiber intake could meaningfully offset other dietary risks, and perhaps reshape the microbiome in protective ways.\n\nOnce researchers began looking beyond diet, they started interrogating other environmental changes as possible multipliers of an individual's risk of colorectal cancer.\n\nArtificial light at night — particularly from phones — disrupts circadian rhythms that regulate DNA repair. Long periods of sitting can slow gut motility and increase inflammation. Air pollution inflames the gut lining and introduces carcinogenic particles directly to the colon.\n\nThese aren't \"causes\" in isolation. But, together with nutrition and metabolism, they can disrupt how genes operate. Over time, these changes can trigger more disease.\n\nThis is the focus of Dr. Heinz-Josef Lenz's research at the University of Southern California Cancer Center. As a gastroenterologist, he has been troubled by a rise in young Latino men developing colon cancer in high school and college — many of them are athletic and healthy with no known risk factors. Lenz says their higher-than-average occurrence of young colon cancer is not due to any particular genetics.\n\n\"What can it be when it's not genetic? It could be epigenetic,\" he said. \"Meaning, what you do, what you eat, what you drink, and related to your parents — how they acted and behaved.\"\n\nAlready, he's seeing clues that young Latino athletes with colon cancer might be suffering from nutritional changes that span multiple generations, based on changes that are inherited.\n\nFor one 15-year-old in Los Angeles, it's possible that a daily Gatorade is enough to promote tumor growth in the colon, while for someone else with a different background, it's not such a big deal.\n\nThough Lenz has seen some interesting data on fructose pathways that appear dysregulated in young colon cancer patients, he is cautious to point out that nothing has emerged that is definitively an \"it\" cancer-causer just yet.\n\n\"The data should be becoming available in the next one or two years,\" he said.\n\nThe hope is that, with time and some more research, Lenz will be able to better tailor treatments to a patient's genetics and background, making each one more effective.\n\nOne promising target is the circadian rhythm, or a person's body clock. Lenz recently teamed up with top body clock researcher Dr. Steve Kay to examine the effects of manipulating the body clock on cancer treatment.\n\n\"What we found is that some circadian clock proteins our lab has been researching for many years are the 'gas pedal' to cancer,\" Kay said in a press release. \"Out of that came a whole set of experiments that started to really blow all of us away. Drugs that my lab developed to target the circadian clock showed they could kill colorectal cancer cells.\"\n\nFor oncologists, the rise in young cases is not just a scientific challenge. Young patients often arrive confused and ashamed because they believe cancer is strongly associated with their own lifestyle choices.\n\nCannon says this misconception adds to the pain. \"The public understands cancer as more related to personal behavior than oncologists do,\" he said. \"You don't have total control over this, as far as I can tell.\"\n\nAll of the researchers we spoke to for this story cautioned that people shouldn't misinterpret this emerging science as a lifestyle playbook just yet.\n\nThey did encourage some lifestyle modifications. This includes more fiber, less sugar, more movement, and better sleep.\n\nWhen it comes to the extreme athletes Cannon is studying, his own leading hypothesis is that the stress of extreme endurance training might starve intestinal tissue of oxygen and create more opportunities for cancerous mutations. His research is far from conclusive. \"The theories are all over the place,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't want to overstate how much you can control this with any behavior,\" he said. \"In the end, it's still a chance event.\"",

    "title": "Backyard tiny homes are finally legal in New York City. They could be a boon for homeowners who can afford construction.",
    "description": "The NYC government has begun accepting applications from homeowners who want to build an ADU, including a backyard tiny home, on their property.",
    "fullText": "It's open season for some New York City homeowners interested in building a tiny home in their backyard.\n\nUnder a sweeping zoning reform Mayor Eric Adams signed into law late last year, the city made it legal for certain one- and two-family homeowners to add an additional home, also known as an \"ancillary dwelling unit\" or ADU, to their property.\n\nOn September 30, 2025, the city finalized its rules for backyard and attic ADUs and began accepting applications from homeowners, although the government is still working on the rules for basement units. The city estimates that the reform — part of its City of Yes for Housing Opportunity package — will help create about 25,000 new homes in backyard cottages and converted garages, attics, and basements over the next 15 years. But the success of the reform will depend in large part on homeowners navigating high construction costs and regulations.\n\nWil Fisher has spent the last year preparing for this. The former city government employee founded a Queens-based firm, Unit Two Development, that helps homeowners determine whether their property is eligible for an ADU and connects them with contractors and others who can help them build one. Fisher said he and his team have identified well over 100,000 eligible individual properties, and they've talked with more than 100 of these homeowners, who largely live in Queens and Staten Island.\n\n\"The rules of the road are now written,\" Fisher said. \"It was a long process, but for the most part we're off to the races.\"\n\nMost of the people Fisher has talked with are interested in adding an ADU to house a family member, including an aging parent or a relative with disabilities who needs care, or an adult child.\n\nMaggie Ornstein is one of these homeowners. Ornstein, 47, lives with her mother in a house in western Queens that has been home to five generations of her family since the 1800s. She hopes to build an ADU for her mother, who's undergoing treatment for cancer and is having difficulty navigating the stairs in their two-and-a-half-story home.\n\nOrnstein, a public health geographer, has consulted with Fisher and determined that she could legally convert her garage into a home.\n\n\"My dream for an ADU on my property would be something that would be accessible, but might also have a second floor where a family member could potentially stay if they wanted to visit, or if I wanted to be with my mom in the ADU,\" she said.\n\nAfter months of planning and big picture discussions with potential clients, Fisher is starting to nail down the specifics of what his clients could build and what it might cost.\n\n\"Now is sort of the pivot from the conceptual to here's exactly what it will take, and here are the cost implications of that,\" he said.\n\nOne inevitable obstacle homeowners face is the steep price of building in the city. Fisher estimates that adding a backyard unit or converting a garage will start between $300,000 and $400,000, depending on the project's size. That's compared to the city's median home price of $800,000.\n\nThe construction cost is out of reach for many homeowners who'd benefit most from adding an ADU to their property, said Thomas Yu, executive director of Asian Americans for Equality, an advocacy organization and affordable housing provider. Yu said there needs to be a much clearer and more affordable path to adding an ADU before the regulatory reform will unleash construction in lower and middle-income neighborhoods. He suggested tax abatements or grants for homeowners with more modest means.\n\nMany of the New Yorkers Yu and his team work with live in overcrowded homes with multiple generations of their family. They could benefit from having a home for an older relative or an adult child who couldn't otherwise afford to stay in the city.\n\n\"The ability for that generation to achieve independent homeownership is zero, particularly in New York City,\" Yu said of younger New Yorkers. \"So ADUs are the next half-step that's needed for that.\"\n\nOrnstein said she's been discouraged by the price tag on her potential project. She's also turned off by how extensive and involved the construction would likely be, especially given her work schedule and caregiving responsibilities. She's hoping to find some government funding to help pay for the project.\n\n\"It's so much more expensive than I would have anticipated,\" she said. \"On the one hand, you wouldn't be able to buy an apartment in New York City for what an ADU would cost to build. But on the other, it's really a lot of upfront cost.\"\n\nThe expense and hassle of adding an ADU might not make sense for homeowners who are just looking for rental income, Fisher said. But he expects the units will be easily rentable for those who want a tenant either immediately or in the future. Adding an ADU also tends to hike the property's resale value.\n\n\"As far as I'm seeing, construction costs are a little too high for them to be a slam dunk rental investment from day one,\" Fisher said. \"But for folks who have a relative or an immediate need that exists within their own family or social network, these are going to be good investments in the long term.\"\n\nADU construction is also limited by a slew of regulations. The units can't be bigger than 800 square feet or take up more than a third of a homeowner's backyard. The law also restricts basement ADUs in areas prone to flooding and prohibits them in attached homes, like townhouses.\n\nThe Regional Plan Association, a pro-housing nonprofit focused on the tri-state area, found that just 68,000 lots — 12% of the city's one- and two-family properties — are eligible to add an ADU.\n\nThe city says it's creating a \"one-stop shop\" full of information for homeowners interested in building an additional unit. The site will include a set of public, pre-approved backyard ADU designs submitted by architects, designers, and builders that homeowners can use to lower design costs and speed up the construction process.\n\n\"Efficiencies that can be built in are really going to be make or break for this market,\" Fisher said.",

    "description": "Rodin Roohipour is a 15-year-old interested in tech and venture capital. To learn about the industry, he cold emails business leaders for advice.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Rodin Roohipour, a 15-year-old from Los Angeles. It's been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider verified the email correspondences mentioned.\n\nI've wanted to start a company since I was 12.\n\nWhen I was younger, at 8, I loved building things. I started coding very early. Then I turned 12, I did this entrepreneurship program, and I got really into it. I kept trying to build these companies, these little side projects, but nothing took off.\n\nEventually, I realized a really important thing you need to have is knowledge. I knew nothing about tech or venture capital. I decided to learn everything the best way I could, which is by talking to the most knowledgeable people.\n\nThat led me to all these cold emails.\n\nThe biggest names were Alfred Lin from Sequoia Capital, Mark Cuban, Paul Graham. They've given so much good advice.\n\nWhen I emailed Alfred Lin, I had to follow up three times. I asked him what his issues were in venture capital.\n\nI emailed Julia Lipton from Awesome People Ventures, and she responded three weeks after my follow-up and seemed happy to chat. She was the first big person I ever called with.\n\nWhen I emailed Mark Cuban, I really had to personalize it. This guy gets like 500 emails a day. You have to stand out. I said: \"I'm currently a high school student who uses Al a LOT and went to your bootcamp a while back.\" That captured his attention.\n\nA lot of people are like, \"Can you get on a meeting?\" You need to go in with no expectations. You should just share your story and say, \"One sentence of advice would help.\"\n\nA lot of people hide the interesting parts about themselves because they think that it'll scare people off. In my first few emails, I talked like a salesman. It sounds super professional, but the problem with that is, it sounds like a sales pitch. It'll go to your promotions folder.\n\nYou need to use the extreme or unusual attributes around you.\n\nI view an email as two parts: the subject and the body. The subject is what you're using to get someone to open it. You don't need to explain anything. You don't need to introduce yourself.\n\nThe subject line I've been using a lot is: \"writing this email to you while in my high school math class.\" It's a bit generic, so if you're emailing someone like Mark Cuban, you would change it. But it works really well. (I don't actually write the emails in my math class. I just schedule them for the morning.)\n\nIt's a pattern break. If all your emails are like \"I'm going to fix this\" or \"I'm going to do that,\" nobody cares. That subject line captures your eye. A 14-to-18-year-old? What's he doing in my inbox? Math class reinforces that.\n\nThe body of the email is where everything else happens. You present your real argument, why the person you're emailing is relevant, and why helping you makes sense for them.\n\nA clever subject line can't save a bad email. You'll have 500 opens but two replies.\n\nPaul Graham was one of the biggest emails I got. I told him, \"I'm Rodin, 14 y/o and super interested in VC and startups. I'm building a product that is a trust platform for VCs / founders. I would love to chat with you about your story and some problems you face. Even 10 mins would mean a lot.\"\n\nHe gave me a blunt reply, but it was nice. He told me: \"This is a mistake. You are much better off focusing on learning math and programming. Build your own LLM.\"\n\nEven if these people don't give you big replies, it's important that you're in their network. It builds a slight connection.",

    "description": "From Disney's $1 billion bet on OpenAI to a wave of blockbuster acquihires, these deals reshaped the tech industry in 2025.",
    "fullText": "While most of the industry was out of office over the holidays, Nvidia and SoftBank's deal teams were grinding.\n\nBoth companies chose the year's quietest stretch to drop news that was anything but: SoftBank said Monday it will acquire digital infrastructure investor DigitalBridge for about $4 billion.\n\nNvidia's move was stranger still. On Christmas Eve, it announced a \"non-exclusive licensing agreement\" with Groq, the startup behind custom chips designed to handle AI inference — the real-time work that powers chatbot replies. The companies did not disclose financial terms.\n\nWhile Nvidia didn't call it an acquisition, the guts of the arrangement looked familiar. Groq founder and CEO Jonathan Ross, along with top engineering staff, will head to Nvidia. Groq, last valued at $6.9 billion in a funding round three months ago, will continue to operate independently.\n\nIt's the latest example of a new kind of tech dealmaking, where the founder and key engineers get bought out, the technology gets siphoned off, and the startup itself is left in limbo.\n\nThat's the vibe of 2025: big, hairy deals that refuse to stay inside the lines.\n\nThe industry's biggest moves weren't just splashy acquisitions or eye-watering funding rounds. (We saw those deals, too.) They were sprawling, hard-to-categorize transactions. Money came tied to compute. Licensing came paired with talent raids. Infrastructure deals locked governments and corporate America into yearslong dependencies. These weren't neat mergers or simple checks. They were power grabs that shifted the balance of Silicon Valley and beyond.\n\nThese were the eight deals that defined the year in AI, ranked from smallest to largest by dollar value.\n\nNvidia ended the year doing the same thing that turned heads all year: extracting founders from their startups and leaving other employees to figure it out.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Nvidia announced it had entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Groq. The financial terms were undisclosed.\n\nUnder the agreement, Jonathan Ross, Groq's founder and CEO, as well as the startup's president and other team members, will join Nvidia, the world's most valuable company with a market capitalization of over $4.5 trillion.\n\nGroq will continue to operate as an independent company, with CFO Simon Edwards assuming the CEO role.\n\nDisney struck a three-year licensing agreement with OpenAI in December, becoming the first major content partner for Sora, OpenAI's video generator.\n\nThe deal isn't just about rights. Disney will invest $1 billion in OpenAI and receive warrants to buy additional equity — a structure that ties content, distribution, and upside together.\n\nBusiness Insider reporter Lucia Moses argues the logic can be summed up in one word: engagement. Time spent on Disney+ and other major streaming services has remained essentially flat in recent years, she writes, while YouTube and social video continue to grow.\n\nThe OpenAI partnership could help Disney meet audiences where they already are, by allowing fans to use tools like ChatGPT and Sora to generate and remix content featuring Disney characters.\n\nDeveloper coding assistant Windsurf was a startup Cinderella story. Then it became a cautionary tale.\n\nThe company was in talks to sell to OpenAI for $3 billion this past spring. The deal fell apart at the last minute.\n\nGoogle emerged as a new suitor. Instead of an outright acquisition, Google said it would pay $2.4 billion to hire its CEO and top talent, as well as license the company's intellectual property.\n\nThe deal effectively split Windsurf into two pieces, with the hundreds of remaining employees ending up at Cognition, another AI coding startup. That left some with a bitter taste.\n\nPart of the social contract in startups is that early employees work long hours at lower pay in the hope that they will share in the riches should their startup eventually get acquired or go public.\n\nNow, traditional acquisitions have become rarer because of the time and uncertainty of getting regulatory approval. As a result, companies like Google, Microsoft, and Meta have been getting creative, using licensing deals to skirt regulators and snap up key talent.\n\nSoftBank snapped up a private equity firm with the ultimate goal of controlling more of the physical infrastructure behind AI.\n\nOn Monday, SoftBank said it has entered into an agreement to acquire DigitalBridge, an alternative asset manager that invests in data centers, cell towers, fiber networks, and power that make the AI boom possible.\n\nThe transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2026, subject to regulatory approvals.\n\nThe deal comes as SoftBank reshuffles its portfolio. In November, the company said it had sold nearly $6 billion of Nvidia stock to free up cash for OpenAI. SoftBank is also doubling down on \"physical AI,\" building a robotics beachhead with a dedicated investment arm and a pending deal to buy ABB's robotics business.\n\nThe Trump administration agreed to take a 9.9% stake in Intel in August. It was a rare moment when Washington wasn't just regulating an industry or subsidizing it, but buying into it.\n\nUnder the terms Intel disclosed, the government will invest $8.9 billion for 433.3 million shares, and the stake is to be passive, with no board seat.\n\nThe investment aims to bolster domestic capacity for designing and manufacturing advanced chips. Intel has seen foreign competitors, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, cut into its market share of advanced chips. The White House has said it is a national security risk if industries continue to import the vast majority of advanced chips from overseas.\n\nThis also likely won't be the last deal of its kind. President Donald Trump and top aides have floated the idea of doing similar deals with American defense contractors and have considered a sovereign wealth fund.\n\nOne of the year's biggest deals sparked the question: Was Meta really spending $14 billion to hire a 28-year-old?\n\nAlexandr Wang cofounded and ran Scale AI, the data-labeling company that helps enterprises train and deploy AI models by supplying high-quality training data and tooling. In June, Meta agreed to pay $14.3 billion for a 49% stake in Scale AI — and, just as importantly, to bring Wang in to lead its next act in AI.\n\nWang became Meta's chief AI officer and the public face of its superintelligence push, with a mandate that goes well beyond building better chatbots. His job is to convince elite researchers that Meta is the place to do their life's work — and to turn the company's key advantage, its compute budget, into a lasting edge.\n\nWhen Google agreed to buy Israeli-American cloud security firm Wiz earlier this year, it threw a $32 billion bucket of water on the idea that the mega-deal drought would persist.\n\nIn March, Google agreed to acquire the startup at an all-cash price roughly equal to Iceland's gross domestic product last year, pending regulatory sign-off. This marks the search giant's largest acquisition.\n\nThe acquisition served as an early litmus test of the Trump administration's willingness to greenlight pricey Big Tech mergers and acquisitions. The deal passed an antitrust review by the Department of Justice in November, clearing a key hurdle to closing.\n\nTrump kicked off his second term by unveiling a joint venture with OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank to build a chain of data centers across the US — a project called Stargate that aims to invest $500 billion in domestic infrastructure by 2029.\n\nIn Abilene, Texas, a flagship data center has already opened. Construction crews have broken ground on Stargate sites in Lordstown, Ohio, and Port Washington, Wisconsin, with several more campuses to come.\n\nTo make the ongoing buildout a success, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has estimated it could take one-fifth of the nation's existing skilled trade workforce.",

    "description": "Warren Buffett became a meme, built a cash mountain, and rocked the business world by announcing his retirement in 2025.",
    "fullText": "Warren Buffett sent shockwaves through the business world in 2025 when he revealed it would be his final year as Berkshire Hathaway CEO — ending a six-decade run in which he transformed the failing textile mill into a vast conglomerate worth over $1 trillion.\n\nThe legendary investor also penned two of his iconic shareholder letters, briefly became a meme, built Berkshire's cash pile to more than $350 billion, took a stake in Alphabet, and rolled out the biggest changes to his company's leadership in decades.\n\nBuffett penned his yearly shareholder letter in February, foreshadowing his departure by talking up two of his planned successors, Greg Abel and Todd Combs.\n\nHe hailed Abel, Berkshire's non-insurance boss and his pick for Berkshire's next CEO, for his honesty and decisiveness. He praised Geico CEO Todd Combs — also one of Buffett's two investment managers, hired to eventually take over Berkshire's portfolio — for swinging the auto insurer from a pre-tax underwriting loss of $1.9 billion in 2022 to a $7.8 billion profit in 2024.\n\n\"Geico was a long-held gem that needed major repolishing,\" Buffett wrote, hailing the improvement under Combs as \"spectacular.\"\n\nBuffett touted Berkshire's tax payments during his tenure, noting the company had gone from paying zero income tax to almost $27 billion in 2024, the most of any US company in history.\n\nHe urged the federal government to \"spend it wisely,\" saying it should go toward helping people who \"get the short straws in life.\"\n\nBuffett went viral during the market correction in March, as followers lauded his prescience in reducing core positions such as Apple and Bank of America and amassing a record cash pile before stocks slumped.\n\nSocial media was filled with people parroting Buffett's advice to \"be greedy when others are fearful,\" and sharing memes about him celebrating or being nonchalant about the sell-off.\n\nTens of thousands of people descended on Buffett's hometown of Omaha in May for Berkshire's shareholder weekend, not knowing they were about to witness history.\n\nAs usual, Buffett held court for hours in an arena filled with his followers. He hailed Geico's turnaround, defended Berkshire's cash hoard, advocated for free trade, warned AI investments could temper returns, and voiced his confidence in Berkshire and America.\n\nIn the closing minutes of the Q&A, Buffett revealed he would step down.\n\n\"I think the time has arrived where Greg should become the chief executive officer of the company at year-end,\" he said.\n\nBuffett said he would continue to \"hang around\" at Berkshire and might be useful on occasion, but the \"final word would be what Greg said — in operations, in capital deployment, whatever it might be.\"\n\nAfter a lengthy standing ovation, Buffett quipped that his shareholders were either applauding his contributions to Berkshire or celebrating his departure.\n\n\"The enthusiasm shown by the audience's response can be interpreted in two ways,\" he said. \"But I'll take it as positive. Thank you.\"\n\nBuffett turned his Thanksgiving message into a love letter to Omaha, in which he reflected on how lucky he's been in life, and thanked the many people who helped him succeed.\n\nThe billionaire gifted Berkshire shares worth about $1.4 billion in total to four of his family's foundations, and said he would accelerate his giving as he wanted his children, now in their 60s and 70s, to distribute virtually his entire fortune.\n\nBuffett hailed Abel as a worthy successor, saying he couldn't think of anyone better to \"handle your savings and mine.\" He also encouraged readers to learn from their mistakes, choose good role models, live up to their desired obituaries, and care for others.\n\n\"When you help someone in any of thousands of ways, you help the world,\" he wrote. \"Kindness is costless but also priceless.\"\n\nBuffett and his team struggled to find bargains once again in 2025 as stocks marched to record highs.\n\nBerkshire sold a net $11 billion of stocks in the first nine months of the year, marking 12 straight quarters as a net seller. It has skipped buybacks for five quarters in a row as well.\n\nThe stock sales and lack of spending helped increase its cash pile, after substracting payables for Treasury purchases, to a record $358 billion as of September 30.\n\nBuffett and his team made several tweaks to Berkshire's stock portfolio. They continued paring Apple and Bank of America, exited Citigroup, and boosted their Occidental Petroleum stake.\n\nThey also unexpectedly built a position in Google-parent Alphabet worth $4.3 billion as of September 30, after placing billion-dollar bets on Constellation Brands and UnitedHealth.\n\nAhead of Buffett's departure as CEO, Berkshire announced sweeping changes to its management team.\n\nThe conglomerate revealed that Combs had resigned to lead a new investment unit at JPMorgan and advise CEO Jamie Dimon.\n\nBerkshire also appointed its first general counsel, announced finance chief Marc Hamburg would retire in June 2027 after 40 years at the company, and disclosed that Abel would be delegating responsibility for more than 30 businesses to NetJets CEO Adam Johnson, in a new role as a divisional president.\n\nBusiness Insider obtained a copy of Combs' farewell letter to Geico employees, which can be read here.",

    "description": "Jim Franck, 81, works as a homebuilder in Oregon and until recently, worked out of financial necessity. He said he has no plans to stop his risky job.",
    "fullText": "This interview is based on a conversation with Jim Franck, 81, a homebuilder in Oregon. Franck said he continues to work to stay active and fulfilled, despite the risks of the job. He has given some of the more intensive responsibilities to his colleagues, though he still is involved with many building tasks. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been building for over 50 years. I started off in the US Virgin Islands. Then, I moved up to Sun River, Oregon, and I went down the coast building houses.\n\nUntil recently, my work has been out of financial necessity. Then, about three or four years ago, home prices doubled, and I was able to sell several rental homes that I'd constructed. Off two homes alone, I made around $700,000 in profit. It was an awful lot of money in one year, and then my income became less important.\n\nI would've kept building anyway, even if I needed the income, but now I don't do it for the money; I'm able to do it as a passion.\n\nI joined the British Merchant Navy when I was in my late teens and got a job as an assistant cook on boats and freighters. We went all around the world, making many stops in the Caribbean. When I left the Merchant Navy, I worked with my brother, who was remodeling enormous houses in London. We worked with investors and turned the homes into apartments.\n\nThen, a friend of mine got a job as a captain on a charter boat out in the Caribbean and needed a cook, so I joined him. One day, we pulled into the US Virgin Islands. I went ashore and made some friends, so I stayed behind on St. Thomas and helped people build houses.\n\nI met my wife there, and we were married and had a son. I got a green card, so I was able to work professionally in the US. As a contractor, I built many concrete houses in St. Thomas, from the foundations to the roof to the finished product, which I then sold.\n\nAround 1980, we came up from the US Virgin Islands to Oregon to see if we liked it. It was a really bad time to have moved; I couldn't find any work. I went back to St. Thomas while my wife stayed in Oregon, and our marriage failed.\n\nI then met my second wife, who was from San Francisco, in St. Thomas. After a hurricane blew through the Virgin Islands and destroyed many houses, we decided to rent out two of the homes I'd built there — which survived the hurricane — because many insurance companies were paying enormous rents for people whose houses had been destroyed. We became interested in Central Oregon, so on one of our ski trips, we bought land in Sun River and moved there.\n\nI started a real estate company and began building down the coast. I still have a copy of the first article a trade magazine wrote about me.\n\nIn 2008, I started thinking about retiring. I had a home that I built down the coast, which we used as our second home, and we spent time there. I kind of retired, but I was always fidgety. I had some custom projects and was doing some design work on future projects.\n\nI took out a loan, bought some land, and started building again in 2015. I put the first house into a rental program, and I was able to secure a mortgage on it, which gave me enough money to buy a lot and build another house. I was building two or three houses a year.\n\nAfter housing prices doubled and I sold my houses, I bought another lot, built a house, and sold it. The last one I sold was $970,000, and I owned it free and clear, so I made a profit.\n\nI now buy beautiful ocean-view lots that are high above the Pacific Ocean. I'm finishing up one house now, which I'm going to keep as a vacation rental, and I just bought another lot, where I'm going to build a three-story house with an elevator. It'll be the first I've ever built with an elevator.\n\nI'm always cognizant of the economy, so I don't want to do anything silly, like build two houses at the same time and then have the problem of being stuck with them.\n\nBoth of my sons can't believe I'm still building houses and working hard. I'm getting to be a bit of a legend around here, too; people come up and ask how old I am and are shocked that I'm still framing houses.\n\nI can't do as much physical labor, and I'm trying to stop doing the heavy lifting. I work with designers, excavators, and a concrete guy, and supervise their work. Then, sheet rockers and painters come in, and we decorate the place. I build homes as if I were going to live in them, since many buyers are older people who are retiring.\n\nI design and build specialties like fireplaces, decks, and screens around hot tubs. I also operate a backhoe, which I really have no problem with. My back hurts a little, and I get sore, but I go home, jump in a bath, and feel grateful I was able to do it.\n\nThe only medication I take is a small blood pressure pill. My respiratory system is excellent, and I can still walk miles a day if I want to. My wife is also in good health, and she spends her days out in the garden.\n\nI don't think I'll ever be able to stop, even though I have plenty of money to live on for the rest of my life, plus a rental house that will bring money in. It's like art to me; an artist keeps painting until they drop dead.",

    "description": "Google's AI told me to make pizza with glue in 2024, so I tried it. Zing! But this year, Google got the last laugh. AI overviews are pretty good.",
    "fullText": "It truly brings me no joy to admit this, but now that it's the end of 2025, I can see that Google's AI Overviews, for as much as I goofed on them for being clumsy and bad, are having the last laugh.\n\nThis realization comes after, in 2024, I totally dunked on Google after its AI told me to use glue to help cheese stick to pizza. So, in a moment of internet infamy, I did just that: I made my glue pizza, and even ate a piece.\n\nThe other day, my editor and I were discussing the state of the AI Overviews. We thought the overviews were pretty abysmal at the start of the year — but we now admit to each other that we use them — instead of traditional search — a lot of the time these days.\n\nOf course, the fact that people (such as myself) are willing to use the AI Overview answer in Google instead of clicking on a link and sending traffic to a website that perhaps employs humans to make that content (such as myself) is not necessarily great.\n\nGoogle AI Overviews launched in the spring of 2024, and immediately, people noticed they often, uh, sucked. The answers they gave were full of absurd inaccuracies.\n\nOne example that went viral on social media was its answer for how to stop the cheese from sliding off your pizza — Google AI suggested adding glue to the sauce, which it seemed to have lifted from a joke on Reddit.\n\nAs a journalist with a commitment to seeking the truth, I actually made a pizza with glue in the sauce and ate it (I'm a trained professional idiot; don't try this at home).\n\nThis year, people noticed that Google AI Overviews still were full of problems. One particularly amusing issue was what we'll call the \"You can't lick a badger twice\" problem: give it a nonsense phrase, and it would accept this as a real idiom and try to explain it.\n\nSomeone on Threads noticed you can type any random sentence into Google, then add “meaning” afterwards, and you’ll get an AI explanation of a famous idiom or phrase you just made up. Here is mine\n\n[image or embed]\n\nTo test more, I made up a few of my own fake idioms like \"you can't fit a duck in a pencil\" and \"the road is full of salsa,\" and indeed, AI Overviews gave explanations for what those phrases meant. Here's what I wrote at the time, back in April:\n\nBut things are getting better. When I tried a fake idiom just the other day (\"you can't tell a yak not to dance\"), it gave a more reasonably accurate answer that it was \"not a common, established idiom, but rather a playful or poetic expression,\" and suggested potential interpretations. Fair enough.\n\nGoogle AI Overviews are getting less laughably bad, and just, well … useful.\n\nI've gotten more used to seeing them, and as I get used to them, I've also gotten better at predicting if the type of query I'm posing is the kind of thing an AI Overview can answer. And it's working more often than it isn't.",

    "fullText": "Dating app fatigue has gone mainstream, with many people growing tired of swiping, ghosting, being ghosted, and generally treading water while searching for the right fish in the sea.\n\nLuckily, there's a barrage of new apps on the market aiming to help you find the love of your life, a friend with benefits, or both.\n\nSome apps, like Sitch and Ditto, use AI to narrow the dating pool, limiting matches or skipping the app interface entirely in favor of text messages. Other apps match users through mutual connections. For singles who are sick of algorithms altogether, there are startups betting on the in-person meet-cute, hosting dinners, or ticketed events.\n\nThe dating startups aim to disrupt the industry's incumbent power players — Tinder, Hinge, Bumble, and Grindr — which defined a generation of online dating, but have since seen their stock values tumble.\n\nThat means opportunity, and investors are pouring money into the space. Dating startups raised $121 million last year, according to PitchBook data.\n\nStill, it's a tough industry to break into. A dating app needs wide adoption — aka enough potential matches — to be a hit.\n\nSo where can you turn to right now to find love, sex, or new relationships of any kind? We've researched 24 apps that have launched in the US since 2020 and could be new alternatives for your doom-swiping.\n\nFinding the one is all about finding the right one — something which can take a lot of work in the old-school apps. With AI matchmaker chatbots and AI-powered algorithms promising better matches, these apps hope to make that a whole lot easier.\n\nThese apps seek to address one common complaint among app daters — the lack of actual dates. Endless flirtations often fizzle before anyone actually meets for drinks or coffee. With location-based features and rewards for getting off the app and into a bar, a handful of new entrants hope to change that.\n\nNot everyone is interested in dating strangers. A handful of apps are trying to build tools that help people narrow their dating pool to people they have mutual friends (or hobbies) with.\n\nThere's a grab bag of apps looking to refine their user bases by specific affinities or matching principles — and prove they're better dating environments than the main apps. Daters are now matching based on astrology, their Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, or different relationship styles.",

    "description": "Antoine Wade said everyone has the same amount of time in a day to learn about AI tools, and in this moment, everyone is competing.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Antoine Wade, a tech sales employee who is based in San Antonio. His identity and employment have been verified by Business Insider. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI started to use AI around 2022 when ChatGPT first launched. It was unlike any technology that I've come across and I started to leverage it in my personal and professional life.\n\nInitially, it helped me craft emails. I work in tech sales and I have to do a lot of cold outreaches. My job is to write messages that resonate with various leaders and ChatGPT helped me with that.\n\nOnce I started using it at work, I realized that as a sports coach and father, there was so much more I could use it for, like sending post-practice communication to parents, building schedules, or putting together statistics of how the game went. Tasks that used to take me days took me literal minutes.\n\nNow I use AI everyday, and I've experimented with different tools. I use Claude to help with business communication and content generation. I use Perplexity for deep research, and Gemini for image generation. I use these tools for a combination of personal, professional, and educational use-cases. I've learned how to install an air conditioner and how to teach my son 6th grade math.\n\nMy company has also given me access to tools that have been really powerful in sales. It can help with gaining a better understanding of the customer in a minute's notice.\n\nFor example, tools like Salesforce Sales Navigator can pinpoint almost the exact person that may be looking for the product I'm selling. Now when I reach out to that person, the conversation will be more fruitful than it would if it were a completely random cold call.\n\nAI hasn't helped me close deals — I'm the one that's built those relationships with customers — but I've seen an increase in my pipeline because I'm able to reach more clients with the data and messaging.\n\nWhen I'm able to understand the customer better, I'm able to communicate more effectively, which leads to building a better pipeline, which ultimately leads to making more money.\n\nWhile people may have access to the same tools, it's still up to the user to put the data together and craft the right prompts. I've been experimenting with so many automation tools that I've developed a secret sauce.\n\nIf I'm creating prompts that give me a better message, which leads to a better outcome, I may not share it with others because I want to see if it works and if it's going to give me a competitive advantage.\n\nWe all have the same amount of time in a day to learn these things. So if I'm putting more time toward learning more about prompt engineering or how AI is supposed to work, then I don't necessarily want to share those learnings with someone else. In this moment, we're all competing.\n\nI will absolutely help someone if they ask, but there are certain details I'm not as forthcoming about. I may share some of those learnings with some of my closest friends or people I feel I can learn from, but that doesn't mean I'm sharing it with everybody.\n\nSales is very competitive and while companies are choosing to have conversations around AI, some people may not be as comfortable sharing how they're leveraging it because that may be their competitive advantage.\n\nWhen people ask if I use AI, I say \"absolutely, yes.\" But there's only a certain amount of people that I'm going into a deeper conversations about AI with.",

    "description": "PE firms respected Dimon's on-cycle recruiting moratorium in 2025. When the clock strikes midnight on Jan 1, it seems the practice might ramp back up.",
    "fullText": "Private-equity firms have been holding off on Wall Street's most notorious hiring ritual — but they may not wait much longer.\n\nOver the summer, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon reshuffled the deck on the PE recruiting practice known as \"on-cycle,\" when he warned his incoming class of junior bankers against accepting future-dated jobs from buyout firms. This crackdown triggered a temporary moratorium on on-cycle recruiting for the 2027 class. Many of the top PE firms slammed on the brakes— Apollo, General Atlantic, TPG, to name a few — and committed to not recruiting for its 2027 class of employees until at least 2026. Some banks went so far as to say they would fire young employees who accepted lucrative PE jobs for two years down the line.\n\nWith January 1 just days away, there are whispers that the notoriously stressful, rapid-fire on-cycle process will kick off early in 2026, now that PE firms have shown Dimon the necessary grace.\n\n\"On-cycle recruiting hasn't kicked off in 2025, but as soon as the ball drops, all bets are off!\" Anthony Keizner, cofounder of recruiting firm Odyssey Search Partners, told Business Insider over email in early December. \"A lot of investment funds are excited that finally again this year, there's a class of investment banking analysts to interview that have training and deal experience.\"\n\nMatt Ting, the founder of Peak Frameworks, which helps people prepare for Wall Street job interviews, said that most respected Dimon's wishes and held off on recruiting this year.\n\n\"The submissions for our private equity résumé database are due at the beginning of January, which is a bit of an indication of when we think recruiting will kick off,\" Ting said in an email.\n\nThe competitive path to becoming a private equity analyst often begins with an equally competitive investment banking career.\n\nThe frantic marathon known as on-cycle recruiting meant junior bankers typically received a call to drop everything at a moment's notice to take an interview for a job that wouldn't start for another two years.\n\nOnce upon a time — almost a decade ago — a January start would have been normal, according to data from Amity Search Partners. But since the pandemic years, recruiting has shifted progressively earlier, recently starting right as analysts hit the desk in their first investment banking jobs.\n\nIn June 2024, PE firms broke their own record when they began recruiting for 2026 jobs. Some recruits hadn't even begun training for their first full-time investment banking roles.\n\nThis year had the potential to start even earlier — in May, just weeks before Dimon effectively halted the on-cycle whirlwind, fresh college graduates said they were taking introductory coffee chats with PE firms, casting a shadow over what should have been a moment of relief.\n\nThe anxiety doesn't seem to have gone away. Questions about on-cycle are starting to dot the PE message board of Wall Street Oasis, a gossipy if somewhat frenzied online community.\n\nOne person asked for advice on preparing for interviews. Another commenter recently revived a post about the recruiting process that was originally published in April: \"its starting - buckle up.\"",

    "description": "My wife is an extrovert, and I'm an introvert who needs silence. It caused issues in our relationship until I made intentional \"talking time.\"",
    "fullText": "In the early stages of dating my now-wife, our phone calls were epic as we got to know each other. We'd talk as Cindy drove an hour to work and an hour back home. As a business owner, I had plenty of time for these long conversations.\n\nAfter two years of getting to know each other, we met in person for the first time, and there was an instant spark neither of us could explain. We spent a day together in Florida, and as I was leaving to head back to Wisconsin, we kissed. We decided to date after that, but we were still in a long-distance relationship. The distance meant even more marathon talking sessions.\n\nI didn't realize at the time how much of an issue this would become in our eight-year marriage.\n\nWe were getting to know each other. That, and we were in separate parts of the country, so there were in-person conversations in the midst of daily life, which, for me, is more of an energy drain.\n\nAs our relationship grew, we had more visits and in-person conversations. We spent more time together, and I started to notice how all the talking, especially when I had to work, was affecting me.\n\nWe got married, and I moved to Florida. We were finally together full-time in a \"normal\" relationship. It was then that I started to discover something that only proximity could reveal: My wife is a talkaholic (she'll admit this if you ask); she loves to talk and tell long stories. My wife is extroverted and needs human connection, talking, and lots of socialization.\n\nThe proximity and numerous in-person conversations revealed that I'm introverted and thrive when I'm not speaking. I love quiet and require a lot of it.\n\nBeing married and spending all our time together, after years in a long-distance relationship, made me realize that I prefer to speak as little as humanly possible, dislike long conversations and stories, and need a lot of alone time.\n\nBitterness built up with each conversation and event we attended. What started as an annoyance turned into arguments.\n\nYears of therapy have taught me that I can't let bitterness build up too long and that communication is important. I realized we were not on a good path in our relationship, and something drastic needed to change.\n\nWe had a series of brutally honest conversations that involved more than a few tears. My wife and I discussed what we need from our relationship in terms of attention, communication, and socialization.\n\nWe agreed on a simple rule that works for us as an introvert and an extrovert in a relationship.\n\nWhat this looks like is me going to a hotel for a weekend or visiting my adult kids who still live in Wisconsin, while my wife visits her friends in South Florida.\n\nI also agreed to set aside focused and dedicated time (when I have the bandwidth) to let my wife verbally process everything she needs to get out of her head. I give her \"talking time\" in an intentional way.\n\nThe understanding we came to means I regularly get the alone time I need. The alone time also allows us to miss each other and operate in ways that work best for our personalities.\n\nMy getting the alone time I need has strengthened our marriage.\n\nWe've had the opportunity to test the rule even more after we moved from the US to Thailand permanently.\n\nWe are now in a situation where there's no family close by, the friends we hung out with in the US aren't here, and we're not getting frequent visits from our adult kids. We are all we have in a foreign country, which is harder for my wife.\n\nIn our first few months here, I wanted to give my wife what she needed: extra attention and time together, talking it up about anything and everything.\n\nAs we've started to settle in, I've been coworking at Starbucks throughout Bangkok, taking long walks alone, and having plenty of solo foot massages. I also built out a detached office, where I spend a lot of time alone.\n\nMy wife has also made friends and attended local women's networking events; she's getting the socialization and talking time she needs. She's building her community, and they seem to enjoy talking in the same way she does.\n\nWe're both getting what we need to keep our mental health and relationship healthy.\n\nMost importantly, I've learned that it's OK to prioritize what I need, and that I don't always have to put the needs of my loved ones before my own. I can put myself first without everything falling apart.",

There was some discussion as to whether to include the outage on the Y2K dashboard or not.\"\n\nNow let's meet another reader we'll call \"Kerry\" who worked for a University that ordered all computers machines be turned off for Y2K eve.\n\nKerry's job saw him manage a fleet of Unix servers, and he decided to ignore that instruction.\n\n\"I was confident that nothing serious would go wrong and that my users could continue to work from home,\" he told On Call.\n\nKerry therefore went home and prepared for the millennium eve party he intended to host.\n\n\"At around 4pm everything electrical stopped working,\" he told The Register. \"I felt the bottom drop out from under me. Were the doomsday predictions true?\"\n\n\"I quickly found out the out that my neighbors did not have the same problem,\" Graham told On Call. \"The main fuse of my house had blown because we were using way too much power.\"\n\nAnd when he returned to work the following week, all was well – other than the banner page on print jobs dated \"Monday January 3 1900.\"\n\nNow let's meet a reader we'll Regomize as \"Rob\" who at the time of Y2K worked for Sun Microsystems in the UK.\n\nAs a global company, Sun had an early warning system for any Y2K problems: Its Australian office was 11 hours ahead of the UK office, so if any problems struck there, the company would get advance notice.\n\nWhich is why, as midnight neared Down Under, Rob's boss called Sun's Sydney office … then heard the phone line go terrifyingly silent as the clock ticked pas midnight. Rob said that \"scared the hell out of my manager\" – at least for a few moments, because the phone soon rang.\n\n\"It was the Australian office, laughing their heads off,\" Rob told On Call. ®",

Then I spoke to the people who uploaded ChatGPT generated content on Wikipedia.\n\nIt began as a standard maintenance project: I wanted to write a tool to find and fix broken ISBN references in Wikipedia. Using the built-in checksum, this seemed like a straightforward technical task. I expected to find mostly typos. But I also found texts generated by LLMs. These models are effective at creating plausible-sounding content, but (for now) they often fail to generate correct checksums for identifiers like ISBNs. This vulnerability turned my tool into an unintentional detector for this type of content. This talk is the story of that investigation. I'll show how the tool works and how it identifies this anti-knowledge. But the tech is only half the story. The other half is human. I contacted the editors who had added this undeclared AI content.

    "fullText": "From Stanley Tucci’s imperious tech titan to Lex Luthor’s distractingly hot CEO and Elon Musk-esque blowhards, films this year took us inside the billionaire mindset\n\nBetween the slash-and-burn US government reboot led by a dank meme fan and the relentless pushing of AI by venture capital-backed blowhards, 2025 has felt like peak obnoxious tech bro. Fittingly, jargon-spouting, self-regarding digital visionaries also became Hollywood’s go-to baddies this year in everything from blockbusters to slapstick spoofs. Spare a thought for the overworked props departments tasked with mocking up fake Forbes magazine covers heralding yet another smirking white guy as “Master of the Metaverse” or whatever.\n\nWith such market saturation, the risk is that all these delusional dudes blend into one smarmy morass. It felt reasonable to expect that Stanley Tucci might sprinkle a little prosciutto on The Electric State, Netflix’s no-expense-spared alt-history robot fantasia. As Ethan Skate – creator of the “neurocaster” technology that quashed an AI uprising then turned the general populace into listless virtual-reality addicts – Tucci certainly looked the part: bald and imperious in retro Bond villain wardrobe. But even the great cocktail-maker couldn’t squeeze much out of sour existential proclamations such as: “Our world is a tyre fire floating on an ocean of piss.”\n\nThere was more baldness in Superman, where Nicholas Hoult’s Lex Luthor embodied the worst kind of wannabe paradigm-changer: one desperate to appear on talkshows. Incensed that the world seemed to be ignoring his genius in favour of a flying alien do-gooder, the LuthorCorp founder spent a fortune to rig social media, deploying an army of vivisected monkey cyborgs to swamp platforms with anti-Superman hashtags and memes. That the film itself was met with farmed outrage about perceived wokeness added a disconcerting hall-of-mirrors feel to what was essentially an overstuffed crowdpleaser. Hoult’s Lex was also a distractingly hot tech CEO, which pushed the film further into the realm of fantasy.\n\nIs it more appealing when these self-regarding douchebags are funny? In the heightened world of killer doll action thriller M3gan 2.0, Jemaine Clement was sleazily overconfident as Alton Appleton, a high-functioning billionaire whose latest wheeze was pushing an unwanted neural implant on the masses. Seduced by an impassive fembot assassin, Alton was humiliated in his final moments, his signature Altwave tech effortlessly hacked, his weird prosthetic six-pack coming unstuck. It was pathetic but humanising. As the movie trundled on, you actually began to miss him.\n\nIf Clement nailed tech bro obliviousness, Danny Huston had to remain deadpan opposite Liam Neeson’s blathering Frank Drebin Jr in The Naked Gun reboot. Huston’s Richard Cane was a hybrid Jeff Bezos/Elon Musk-esque blowhard who used the galactic profits from his online retail and electric car empires to make a Primordial Law of Toughness device . His master plan was to zap the general public back to a prehistoric mindset, violently culling the herd and ushering in a new age for humankind (or at least his zillionaire class). Cane was obsessed with men’s sperm counts, building luxury bunkers for the super-rich and Black Eyed Peas. In other words: truly psychotic.\n\nIn the goopy, grungy world of The Toxic Avenger reboot, Kevin Bacon’s floppy-haired biotech baddie Bob Garbinger stood out simply because he looked so pale and pampered. While it’s not a great sign when a self-proclaimed “healthstyle” guru gets Sisyphus and syphilis mixed up, Garbinger’s habit of going shirtless while flogging “proprietary cutting-edge bio-boosters” in TV ads felt like a timely skewering of immortality-seeking biohackers such as Bryan Johnson.\n\nIn 2022, Evan Peters played the lead in Netflix’s ghoulish Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story. Did that influence his casting as a second-generation nepo baby in Tron: Ares? To be fair, his Julian Dillinger – grandson of David Warner’s boardroom bully from the original 1982 Tron – seemed more neurotic than psychotic: a baby-faced tech huckster with crappy circuit board sleeve tattoos whose audacious move into 3D-printing wicked neon war machines and digital commandos was only slightly scuppered by the fact that they imploded within 30 minutes. A wildly expensive, resource-intensive, essentially useless product? Intentionally or not, it felt like an appropriate metaphor for the AI bubble.\n\nBut why stop at just one douchey tech bro? Jesse Armstrong’s jagged satire Mountainhead took the bold step of making every single character the absolute worst of the “move fast, break stuff” billionaire mindset, isolating them – and the viewer – in a remote, repellently deluxe ski lodge while the spectre of possible Armageddon encroached. As the Musk-alike owner of a social media app spreading dangerous AI-augmented misinformation, Cory Michael Smith captured the glib, morality-agnostic tone of someone richer than God who views the world as their plaything.\n\nAs Venis (Smith), silverback investor Randall (Steve Carell), canny algorithm tamer Jeff (Ramy Youssef) and would-be wellness app supremo Souper (Jason Schwartzman) relentlessly needled each other, there was the illicit thrill of dialling into the combative quartet’s inside-baseball repartee of boasting, toasting and roasting. But as the globe lurched further into chaos, watching these four nominal thought leaders clumsily workshop how best to exploit the situation was depressing, not least because it seemed so plausible. We have all been forced to absorb the pathologies of our tech overlords due to their disproportionate influence in the real world. As a new cinema year looms, is it too much to ask that we don’t have to keep doing it at the movies too?",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: CST highlights volume of IS-supporting accounts and says social media firms ‘putting all of us in danger’\n\nFacebook hosted terrorist propaganda that celebrated the murder of Jews and praised Islamic State, a leading anti-hate group has alleged.\n\nThe posts included celebrations of the Bondi beach massacre that the Community Security Trust says Facebook has been too slow to take down. The posts were still on Facebook on 16 December, two days after the attack, and received shares and likes.\n\nSome accounts are Britain-based and those have been reported to counter-terrorism police in the UK as a matter of urgency.\n\nOne post shows video of the aftermath of the Bondi beach attack, which was allegedly carried out by a father and son who were IS supporters, and says: “Allah is the greatest and praise to Allah.” It has clearly been viewed, with more than 100 likes, 27 comments and four shares recorded.\n\nFifteen people were killed as they celebrated the Jewish festival of Hanukah in Sydney on 14 December. One of the attackers also died.\n\nAnother post shows a photo of one of the Bondi beach gunmen and says: “The coming years of art and hell,” and contains praise for an IS leader. This had 12 shares and more than 300 likes.\n\nFacebook said it was in the process of removing some of the posts after being contacted by the Guardian, and said some had already been spotted and removed.\n\nDave Rich, the director of policy for the CST, which works to keep Jewish people safe from attack, said: “The sheer volume of IS-supporting accounts promoting terrorist content on Facebook is deeply alarming, and the posts celebrating the Bondi terrorist attack are utterly nauseating.\n\n“Yet again, social media companies are incapable of meeting even their most basic of responsibilities and are putting all of us in danger as a result. This simply should not be happening any more. We will be calling on Ofcom to urgently investigate Meta’s failings and to take strong action where possible.”\n\nOfcom, the media regulator, said: “If a post is reported to a platform now, the platform must decide whether the content is illegal under UK law, and take it down swiftly if it is. Our job is to make sure sites and apps have appropriate measures in place to comply with their duties.”\n\nIt said it had received “evidence that suggests terrorist content and illegal hate speech is persisting on some of the largest social media sites”.\n\nA spokesperson for Meta, which owns Facebook, declined to answer a series of questions but said: “The content was removed for violating our policies around dangerous organisations and individuals.”\n\nA Home Office spokesperson said: “Social media content promoting terrorism or violence against communities is absolutely unacceptable, and will not be tolerated. The law is clear: social media platforms must take action to prevent illegal content on their sites, including terrorist and violent material.”\n\nThe focus on pro-IS material on popular social media sites comes amid concern about an increase in terrorist efforts to target Jewish people across the west.\n\nTwo men were convicted on 22 December of a plot to get machine guns and shoot Jewish people around the north-west of England. In that plot and the Sydney massacre, both sets of terrorists’ approaches had a degree of sophistication.\n\nThough neither was “directed” by IS, the Sydney attackers visited the Philippines and the north-west England machine-gun plotters had contact with an IS person overseas and were sophisticated enough to try to bypass Jewish community security and infiltrate a Facebook group, giving them details of potential Jewish targets.\n\nRich said of the English plot: “This is an even more serious plot than the attack on the synagogue in Heaton Park and indicates a much greater level of training and sophistication.”\n\nVicki Evans, the senior national coordinator for counter-terrorism policing, told the Guardian: “The terrorist threats we face do not stand still and we rarely confine them to history. Instead, they flex in intensity and risk over time – and so does our response.\n\n“Recent attacks in Manchester and Australia are clear reminders of the range of threats we face, and we continue to ask the public to … report any concerns they see in their real-world or online communities.”",

    "fullText": "Last few months of the year have seen $1tn in value wiped from the market, despite all-time-high price of bitcoin\n\nAs 2025 comes to a close, Donald Trump’s favorable approach to cryptocurrency has not proven to be enough to sustain the industry’s gains, once the source of market-wide optimism and enthusiasm. The last few months of the year have seen $1tn in value wiped from the digital asset market, despite bitcoin hitting an all-time-high price of $126,000 on 6 October.\n\nThe October price peak was short-lived. Bitcoin’s price tumbled just days later after Trump’s announcement of 100% tariffs on China sent shockwaves across the market on 12 October. The crypto market saw $19bn liquidated in 24 hours – the largest liquidation event on record. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, saw a 40% drop in price over the next month. Eric Trump’s own crypto company endured a similar drop in its value in December.\n\nIn Donald Trump, the crypto industry was delivered the pro-bitcoin president they were promised during his campaign. Within days of taking office for the second time, he issued an executive order that repealed restrictions on cryptocurrency and introduced new favorable regulations as well as a presidential working group on digital assets.\n\n“The digital asset industry plays a crucial role in innovation and economic development in the United States, as well as our Nation’s international leadership,” the order read. He placed cryptocurrency front and center in American policy.\n\nAgain in March, Trump announced a new strategic cryptocurrency reserve that fueled a 62% rally in the market prices of three out of five of the coins named to the reserve. Bitcoin, the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency, went up 10% to $94,164 in the hours after the reserve was announced.\n\nCryptocurrency is sensitive to both narratives and confidence in global markets, said Rachael Lucas, the head of marketing and communications at BTC Markets, Australia’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. It’s what is called a risk-on asset, an investment that does better when investors are feeling confident about the economy and are willing to take on more risk, Lucas said.\n\n“The Trump administration may be pro-crypto, but tariffs and tight monetary policy outweigh positive vibes,” said Lucas. “And it’s also just a reminder, especially for people in crypto, that macro forces really matter more than political stances.”\n\nIn November, bitcoin suffered its biggest drop in price since 2021, bringing the coin’s value to less than $81,000. While bitcoin regained some of that value in the weeks after, the digital token started December with another slump, dropping 6% after Strategy, the biggest holder of bitcoin, cut its earnings forecast because of the slide in crypto prices. Bitcoin’s price now hovers near $90,000, up from years past but significantly lower than its peak.\n\nIn the first few days of December 2025, Eric Trump’s crypto firm, American Bitcoin Corp, saw 40% of its value – roughly $1bn – wiped out.\n\nThe Trump family scion put on a bullish face and declared he would ride out the decline. “I’m holding all my @ABTC shares - I’m 100% committed to leading the industry,” Eric Trump said on X at the time.\n\nSome experts fear the industry is entering a so-called crypto winter, a prolonged period of stagnation or losses. The last time, crypto winter lasted from the end of 2021 through 2023, when the FTX mogul Sam Bankman-Fried was tried and convicted. Those years saw bitcoin slump 70% in price.\n\nDespite the optimism fueled by Trump’s win, the current market downturn shows the crypto-friendly administration wasn’t enough to usher in a return to the “retail mania” of 2021, when there was a huge upswing in individual stock trading, said Christian Catalini, the founder of the MIT Cryptoeconomics Lab.\n\n“The recent crash isn’t a change in sentiment, but a collision of three structural factors: the aftershocks of a $19bn leverage washout in October; a risk-off rotation driven by US-China tariff tensions; and, crucially, the potential unraveling of the corporate treasury trade,” Catalini said.\n\nAnother potential factor that may have shaken the crypto market is the downturn in share prices of AI stocks like Nvidia, said Lucas.\n\n“One of the reasons why bitcoin is tied to the AI cycle is because a lot of the bitcoin miners actually started leveraging their energy towards new datacenters,” she said. “Not only is crypto a technical asset, we have the miners actually tied into AI devices going up. That negative sentiment tends to sneak into crypto.”\n\nDespite concerns over a crypto winter, notable players in the crypto space Larry Fink, the CEO of investment management firm BlackRock, and Brian Armstrong, the co-founder of Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the US, expressed optimism about the long-term value of the currency at a recent New York Times conference. Armstrong said “there was no chance” the price of bitcoin would go to zero and in fact 2025 would be seen as the year “when crypto went from gray market to a well-lit establishment”. Fink, for his part, said his firm had observed “legitimate long owners investing in the currency”, including sovereign wealth funds.\n\nLucas said that this downturn in crypto prices was not inconsistent with past four-year bitcoin cycles and that she was not worried about entering a much more sustained crypto winter.\n\n“If I was looking at it from a traditional bitcoin cycle, we are actually technically in a bear market,” said Lucas. “But as you can see, even with all of these macros that are affecting the market, bitcoin has still managed to set a price above $80,000.”",

    "description": "BBC Sport reflects on a stellar year for South Africa which threatens to be overshadowed by a lack of home Test cricket.",
    "fullText": "From a certain vantage point, the health of Test cricket in South Africa appears terminal.\n\nFor the first time since sporting isolation during apartheid, there will be no red-ball action in the country this summer. Instead, fans must make do watching Indian-owned T20 franchises compete in the SA20.\n\nThe next time the Proteas take the field in whites on home soil will be October 2026, 21 months after hosting Pakistan in January this year.\n\nAnd yet the Test team itself has rarely looked in better shape, with 2025 proving a watershed year.\n\nRyan Rickelton registered his country's first double century for nine years as Pakistan were swept 2–0. In June, a sublime fourth-innings 136 from Aiden Markram, allied to a nine-wicket match haul from Kagiso Rabada, carried South Africa to a five-wicket victory over Australia in the World Test Championship (WTC) final at Lord's.\n\nAnd with the choker's tag finally dislodged, and momentum behind them, South Africa are on track to qualify for another WTC final.\n\nWiaan Mulder threatened Brian Lara's record for the highest Test score when he declared himself on 367 against Zimbabwe in July. In October, Keshav Maharaj bagged a seven-for in Rawalpindi to square the series with Pakistan.\n\nA month later, Simon Harmer claimed 17 wickets in two Tests as South Africa beat India 2-0 in their own backyard, becoming the first South African team to win away in India since 2000.\n\n\"It's been a remarkable period for us,\" says Sunuran Muthusamy, the spin-bowling all-rounder who scored his maiden century in the 408-run win in the second Test against India.\n\n\"We're straight into the SA20 so it's hard to really take stock. But in the small moments when we've had a chance to reflect, we know that we've found a great formula. It feels like things are really clicking.\"",

    "fullText": "In 2024, I took the leap to go indie full-time. By 2025, that shift enabled me to focus exclusively on building tools I care about, from a blogging platform, iOS apps, and macOS utilities, to Emacs packages. It also gave me the space to write regularly, covering topics like Emacs tips, development tutorials for macOS and iOS, a few cooking detours, and even launching a new YouTube channel.\n\nThe rest of this post walks through some of the highlights from 2025. If you’ve found my work useful, consider sponsoring. Now let’s jump in.\n\nFor well over a decade, my blogging setup consisted of a handful of Elisp functions cobbled together over the years. While they did the job just fine, I couldn't shake the feeling that I could do better, and maybe even offer a blogging platform without the yucky bits of the modern web. At the beginning of the year, I launched LMNO.lol. Today, my xenodium.com blog proudly runs on LMNO.lol.\n\nLMNO.lol blogs render pretty much anywhere (Emacs and terminals included, of course).\n\n2026 is a great year to start a blog! Custom domains totally welcome.\n\nSure, there are plenty of journaling and note-taking apps out there. For one reason or another, none of them stuck for me (including my own apps). That is, until I learned a thing or two from social media.\n\nWith that in mind, Journelly was born: like tweeting, but for your eyes only. With the right user experience, I felt compelled to write things down all the time. Saving to Markdown and Org markup was the mighty sweet cherry on the cake.\n\nAs a Japanese language learning noob, what better way to procrastinate than by building yet another Kana-practicing iOS app? Turns out, it kinda did the job.\n\nHere's mochi invaders, a fun way to practice your Kana\n\n2025 brought us the likes of Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Goose, Codex, and many more AI/LLM CLI agents. While CLI utilities have their appeal, I wanted a native Emacs integration, so I simply ignored agents for quite some time.\n\nI was initially tempted to write my own Emacs agent, but ultimately decided against it. My hope was that agent providers would somehow converge to offer editor integration, so I could focus on building an Emacs integration while leveraging the solid work from many teams producing agents. With LLM APIs historically fragmented, my hope for agent convergence seemed fairly far-fetched.\n\nTo my surprise, ACP (Agent Client Protocol) was announced by Zed and Google folks. This was the cue I had been waiting for, so I set out to build acp.el, a UX agnostic elisp library, followed by an actual client: agent-shell.\n\nI'm fairly happy with how agent-shell's been shaping up. This is my most popular package from 2025, receiving lots of user feedback. If you're curious about the feature-set, I've written about agent-shell's progress from early on:\n\nWhile agent-shell is the new kid on the block, chatgpt-shell received DeepSeek, Open Router, Kagi, and Perplexity support, in addition to a handful of other improvements and bugfixes.\n\nWhile most of what I share usually ends up as a blog post, this year I decided to try something new. I started the Bending Emacs YouTube channel and posted 8 episodes:\n\nEnjoying the content? Leave me a comment or \n\nWhile I enthusiastically joined the Emacs Carnival, I didn't quite manage monthly posts. Having said that, when I did participate, I went all in, documenting my org experience over the last decade. Ok well… I also joined in with my elevator pitch ;)\n\nWhile migrating workflows to Emacs makes them extra portable across platforms, I've also accumulated a bunch of tweaks enhancing your Emacs experience on macOS.\n\nWhile we're talking macOS, I typically like my desktop free from distractions, which includes hiding the status bar.\n\nHaving said that, I don't want to lose track of time, and for that, I built EverTime, an ever-present floating clock (available via Homebrew).\n\nEmacs ships with a perfectly functional world clock, available via M-x world-clock, but I wanted a little more, so I built time-zones.\n\nFor better or worse, I rely on WhatsApp Messenger. Migrating to a different client or protocol just isn't viable for me, so I did the next best thing and built wasabi, an Emacs client ;)\n\nWhile not a trivial task, wuzapi and whatsmeow offered a huge leg up. I wanted tighter Emacs integration, so I upstreamed a handful of patches to add JSON-RPC support, plus easier macOS installation via Homebrew.\n\nWhile both macOS and iOS offer APIs for generating URL previews, they also let you fetch rich page metadata. I built rinku, a tiny command-line utility, and showed how to wire it all up via eshell for a nifty shell experience.\n\nWith similar eshell magic, you can also get a neat cat experience.\n\nI always liked the idea of generating some sort of art or graphics from a code base, so I built one, a utility to transform images into character art using text from your codebase. Also covered in a short blog post.\n\nEmacs is just about the perfect porcelain for command-line utilities. With little ceremony, you can integrate almost any CLI tool. Magit remains the gold standard for CLI integration.\n\nWhile trimming videos doesn't typically spring to mind as an Emacs use case, I was pleasantly surprised by the possibilities.\n\nWhile I've built my fair share of Emacs packages, I'm still fairly new at submitting Emacs features upstream. This year, I landed my send-to (aka sharing on macOS) patch. While the proposal did spark quite the discussion, I'm glad I stuck with it. Both Eli and Stefan were amazingly helpful.\n\nThis year, I also wanted to experiment with dictating into my Emacs text buffers, but unfortunately dictation had regressed in Emacs 30.\n\nBummer. But hey, it gave me a new opportunity to submit another patch upstream.\n\nReady Player, my Emacs media-playing package received further improvements like starring media (via Emacs bookmarks), enabling further customizations, and other bug fixes. Also showcased a tour of its features.\n\nHope you enjoyed my 2025 contributions. Sponsor the work.",

We always have done,\" says Webborn.\n\n\"And it's those little things, how we convert those silvers into gold, that just push you up that medal table a little bit higher.\n\n\"The Paralympic team have been brilliant, they've been second in the medal table behind China for the last several Games, but other nations are pushing them. But I believe the character and the innovation that we have in the UK will continue to keep us there.\n\n\"The collaboration between Olympic and Paralympic sports has never been better. You can definitely see that in the discussions that they're having. We're learning from each other.\"\n\nUK Sport has not yet revealed a medal target for the upcoming Winter Games in Milan and Cortina in Italy, but Webborn is optimistic.\n\n\"The current group of athletes are having some amazing success in this early season, it's great to see. That doesn't always transfer into medals at the Games, but we're in a really good place,\" he says.",

    "description": "Creating onboarding documentation for your product? Or just writing up a \"how-to\" for a new internal tool? Here's how you do it.",
    "fullText": "You have 1 article left to read this month before you need to register a free LeadDev.com account.\n\nReceive weekly engineering insights to level up your leadership approach.\n\nEstimated reading time: 5 minutes\n\nDocumentation can be a pain for developers to write and navigate alike. But following this framework might be just the thing you need to make document navigation easier.\n\nDocumentation is the lifeblood of any high-functioning team. At a high level, documents are written to outline the feature processes, details, and general “how-to” elements of a system. The result? A bank of saved knowledge that helps new developers get up to speed quickly, providing a common reference point for all necessary stakeholders.\n\nA common pain point for many teams is unstructured documentation. Without clear guidelines, it’s hard to organize information in a way that’s easy to digest or search through. My team faced this problem when creating onboarding documentation for our new AI product; this would ultimately be used by engineers at client companies integrating the product into their systems.\n\nWe adopted the Diátaxis method as our guiding framework for technical documentation. The Diataxis approach identifies four distinct user needs in documentation: tutorials, how-to guides, explanations, and references.\n\nUltimately, this led to our documentation process improving and our user experience boosting.\n\nWhile the advantages of documentation are manifold, developers (including myself) tend to skip dipping into them if they appear to be unstructured or have an undefined goal.\n\nEach page should have a clear purpose. This sets expectations and helps engineers identify which pages answer their questions. Organizing pages with anticipated questions at the forefront of the design can help you build documentation that engineers navigate more intuitively.\n\nPut yourself in a developer’s shoes. If they’re using a product for the first time, what questions would they likely ask?\n\nStructure your content with user needs first. When your docs are built around real questions, they become easier to flick through and far more useful.\n\nAvoid packing too many ideas into one section. In doing so, you might create a long-winded document that jumps between topics and leaves explanations of singular issues scattered across multiple pages.\n\nThe Diátaxis framework outlines how documentation is composed of three key elements:\n\nSome developers have the skill for content and style, but could bolster their architecture abilities.\n\nWhat’s unique about Diátaxis is that it addresses the challenges of technical writing and breaks them down into four key sections: tutorials, how-to guides, explanations, and references.\n\nThe two quadrants, tutorials and how-to guides belong in the action region. Tutorials and how-to guides are not meant to be consumed passively by readers; rather, they actively help devs learn a new skill or achieve a specific goal.\n\nThe two bottom quadrants, explanations and references, belong in the cognition region. These are resources that readers can read or skim to understand and grasp the essence of a solution.\n\nTutorials and explanations are about skill acquisition. They’re designed to teach – not to solve an immediate task, but to build understanding. The goal is to help readers pick up a new skill relevant to the new tool or product they’re working with.\n\nHow-to guides and references are about skill application. They’re for readers who have already learned the basics and are now ready to put that knowledge into action.\n\nWhen we started to build documentation for our product, we geared the content toward two different technical stakeholders: data scientists and AI engineers. After all, our goal was to have data scientists lean on our AI product when running simulation experiments, subsequently empowering engineers to deploy these experiments to production.\n\nBefore embarking on writing the documents, we defined two main personas and described some key qualities about them to better identify what documentation we needed to create. Let’s call them Alice and Bob.\n\nOnce we defined our two main personas, we designed the following navigation bar for our docsite:\n\nWe have six main “folders” with a defined purpose for each, highlighting the experience level required. The first three folders are meant for beginners or users being onboarded. The next three folders are for already-onboarded users, who have specific goals they want to achieve or details they want to look up.\n\nNote that some of these folders may not be necessary for your solution. For example, if you’re not introducing new abstractions or concepts that readers need to know about, the “concepts folder” may not be required for your docsite.\n\nAfterwards, we assigned our developers to write different parts of the documentation following this architecture for the two main personas, Alice and Bob. Here are some examples where we map a question to a folder.\n\nAs Alice and Bob become better acquainted with the resources, so too does their mental model of the documentation’s architecture. This helps in instances where they may need to help newer colleagues navigate the system. For instance, if Alice is working with the APIs and wants to onboard a new data scientist, she can pull from previous experience and quickly direct the data scientist to the right folder.\n\nStrong developer documentation can be a major selling point for a product. Developers do not trust using a new product in their tech stack unless they can understand its underlying details and have clear product documentation to search through.\n\nSo it’s your job to create a comprehensive database of knowledge that can support devs while they get to grips with your product.",

    "description": "This article examines why the practice of AI startups disguising GMV as ARR distorts business sustainability. It redefines the true meaning of ARR and analyzes how the revenue structure of many AI companies resembles a brokerage or reseller model rather than SaaS. Using the analogy of investors who only inflate transaction volume, it presents—from a consulting perspective—why repeatability, margins, and control are far more critical than the magnitude of the numbers.",
    "fullText": "In recent feeds and headlines covering AI startups, a certain phrase repeats with exhausting frequency:\n\"Reached $X million ARR in just n months.\"\n\nAt first, it is impressive.\nThe second time, it invites skepticism.\n\nThis is not merely a matter of accounting tricks or semantic hair-splitting.\nIt is a fundamental question about the structure of AI businesses, their sustainability, and how we ought to interpret the numbers presented to us.\n\nARR stands for Annual Recurring Revenue.\nThe two operative words here carry weight.\n\nThese are run-rates.\nARR is not a prediction; it is a result verified by time.\n\nFundamentally,\nFor a company less than a year old to claim ARR is, conceptually, a contradiction.\n\nThe year has not passed.\nThe recurrence has not been proven.\n\nARR is the lingua franca of SaaS.\nAnd the language of SaaS invariably connotes:\n\nThus, many AI companies,\neven those far from reaching that stage,\nborrow the term ARR to describe their finances.\n\nThe problem begins exactly there.\n\nPeer slightly beneath the surface of many AI startup revenue structures, and a pattern emerges.\n\nIn this structure, the portion the company actually retains is but a fraction of the total payment.\n\nHere, the correct concept is GMV (Gross Merchandise Value).\n\nGMV represents the total value of merchandise sold through a platform.\nThe critical distinction is this:\n\nIf a platform mediates a transaction and takes a commission,\nGMV ≠ Revenue.\n\nThe illusion specific to the AI industry arises here.\n\nOn the surface, it mimics SaaS perfectly.\n\nIn this structure, calling GMV \"ARR\" is,\nAn act of consuming an unproven future as a present achievement.\n\nTo put it more bluntly,\nit borders on a bluff designed to induce a financing illusion.\n\n\"Model costs are dropping, so even if margins are thin now, they will improve.\"\n\nThis statement is only half true.\n\nTechnology costs do decrease.\nHowever, demand always migrates to the newest, most powerful models.\n\nOf course, low-cost models have their place—simple tasks, non-competitive domains.\n\nBut the question remains:\nIs the product you are building truly that kind of product?\n\nWe are cognitively greedy.\nGiven the same time and money, we desire the smarter brain.\n\nUltimately, the discussion boils down to one thing.\n\nNeither is inherently right or wrong.\nBut how they are valued must be completely different.\n\nA large GMV does not equate to a solid foundation.\n\nThe spectacle of GMV-first growth often reminds me of a familiar scene.\n\nThe investor with $10,000 of capital,\nwho trades dozens of times a day,\nboasting, \"I moved millions in transaction volume this month.\"\n\nThe trades are many.\nThe numbers are large.\nBut what actually remains?\n\nMostly transaction fees paid to the exchange.\nThe volume swells, but the asset base barely moves.\n\nAI startups obsessed with GMV are not so different.\n\nBut the vast majority of that flow\npasses through to model providers and infrastructure giants,\nleaking straight out of the building.\n\nTo discuss GMV as if it were ARR in this context is\nnot a demonstration of capital control,\nbut rather an attempt to prove competence via the sheer volume of money that passed through one's hands.\n\nFrom a consulting perspective, the questions are simple.\n\nARR is not a marketing slogan.\nIt is a report card proving that a financial structure has withstood the test of time.\n\nGMV can be a signal of growth.\nBut it is, at best, a process metric.\nIt cannot substitute for the foundation.\n\nIn the AI era, numbers have become larger and faster.\nThat is precisely why we must be more honest with our terminology.\n\nThe moment you slap the label of ARR onto GMV,\nthe business begins to look solid,\nbut in reality, it is being built on sand.\n\nTime will eventually reveal the truth.\nWhether you were a company that made many trades,\nor a company that accumulated value.\n\nTime always distinguishes the two.",

    "title": "I built a receipt printer for GitHub issues",
    "description": "I wanted a way to have physical tickets from GitHub in front of me. One Epson printer, a Raspberry Pi, and some PHP later, I had a working system in place.",
    "fullText": "I have a lot of side projects on GitHub. Some of them are kind of popular, and I tend to get issues posted from time to time. The problem though is that usually they kind of get lost in the mix of my emails, or I forget to go through my repos and add new items to my todo list.\n\nI've been occasionally writing new issues down on sticky notes whenever I see a notification for an issue, but I always wanted an excuse to streamline the process a bit more. After seeing a receipt printer spitting out orders while grabbing some take-out the other day, I wondered if I could use one to print out a ticket each time an issue was added to one of my repos.\n\nSo here's why I bought a receipt printer:\n\nEvery time one of my GitHub repos gets a new issue, I now get a physical ticket printed out on my desk 🪄 pic.twitter.com/g6uYtGP9J7\n\nSo let's dive in and I'll show you exactly what I used, and how I set it up!\n\nIn order to get started, I'll need a thermal receipt printer and some way to get data into it. I ended up using:\n\nThe reason that I went with an Epson thermal printer is that they use the ESC/POS command set, for which there's established libraries in a variety of programming languages. Plus they're pretty ubiquitous in the second-hand market, and I was able to pick one up on Ebay along with some receipt paper for a pretty fair price.\n\nThe other piece I need is some kind of hardware to connect from the internet to the printer, and facilitate the actual data sending. I could just hook it up to my PC, but I want this to be a fully-contained unit that could just be constantly on idle sitting in a corner. I have an old Raspberry Pi Zero W laying around that I'm not using, so I'll choose that.\n\nBecause the RPi Zero has just a single micro USB port, I'll use an adapter as well as a USB Type-B cable to connect it to the receipt printer.\n\nAlright, so we have the printer hooked up, the Raspberry Pi good to go, but now I need a way to send data to the printer from the Raspberry Pi. This could easily be accomplished with Node or Python, but since I'm a PHP developer and I enjoy stretching the limitations of the language, I'll reach for that. Luckily for me, there's a pretty solid library for working with ESC/POS commands available in PHP.\n\nBefore I write any code though, I have to make sure the printer is available to the program I create. Since I'm using Ubuntu on the Raspberry Pi, I should be able to access it via /dev/usb/lp0 (or another lp#). But it might require a little bit of prep work first.\n\nFirst, I'll open up a terminal in the device that my printer is connected to (for me, that's the Raspberry Pi). I'll run the command lsusb to get the Product ID and Vendor ID from the connection to your printer. It returns something like this:\n\nNext, I create a udev rule to let users belonging to the dialout group use the printer. I create the file /etc/udev/rules.d/99-escpos.rules and add the following to it:\n\nBeing sure to replace the hex values for the vendor and product ID's with what I got returned back from lsusb.\n\nIf my user(s) aren't part of the dialout group, I try to add them to it now:\n\nAnd then finally, I have to restart udev:\n\nNow that I have the connection ready, I can start writing some code to test this out. First, I'll require that library from earlier with Composer:\n\nAfter that's installed, I need to write some code to send data to the printer. I'll create a file called index.php, and add the following:\n\nSo now to run this, all I have to do is execute the script with PHP and root permissions:\n\nIf everything worked out fine, Hello, world! will have printed on a receipt, with two lines skipped, and then the receipt will have cut. How that all works is pretty straightforward.\n\nA print connector is created to the 'file' /dev/usb/lp0, which is the usb adapter that the printer is connected to. The printer commands that are subsequently used (text(), feed(), cut()), stream the raw commands associated with those actions to the printer through that connection.\n\nNote: If you get an error about permissions when sending to /dev/usb/lp0 or something similiar to that, try running sudo chmod +777 /dev/usb/lp0 and seeing if that fixes it.\n\nUsing these methods, I can move on to connecting this with GitHub and populating the receipts with some actual data.\n\nGitHub makes it easy to listen to events on repos with webhooks. By going to one of my repo's settings page and navigating to the webhooks section, I can create a hook that will POST to a specific URL on a given action. For my case, I want to print out a ticket when a new issue is created, so I choose just the 'Issues' section. I also set the data type as JSON, since that's what I enjoy working with.\n\nBut before I continue, I need to have a URL that GitHub could send that POST request to. First, I ssh back into the Raspberry Pi and start up the local PHP server by using the -S flag in my project's directory:\n\nNow that it's running, I need a way to access that port on my Raspberry Pi, while it's on my local network. I don't really want to expose my home's IP address or worry about creating a pass through my router. So, I just ended up using ngrok to tunnel through to the exposed port.\n\nAfter that loads up, I copy the provided https url, and paste it in the GitHub webhook url field. Everything looks good, and I save the webhook. As soon as I save, there should be a test request that's sent out, ngrok accepts the request, tunnels it to the local PHP server, and another Hello, world! will print out.\n\nNow I'm ready to actually use the incoming request from GitHub to build out a ticket.\n\nNow I'll make some modifications to my code from earlier. First, I should discard anything that's not a POST request. So before initializing the FilePrintConnection, I add these lines:\n\nAnd after the FilePrintConnection and Printer initialization, I'll decode the entire JSON request from GitHub as an associative array:\n\nNow, I can use the printer methods from before and the data array from GitHub to build up the receipt I want! Using the Escpos library, formatting text requires a lot of repetitive code. For a small example, here's what a bold and underlined title of the issue, along with the plain text body, looks like:\n\nIf you'd like to see the entire code that I used to format my ticket in the tweet above, you can check it out on the GitHub repo.\n\nNow to test it out, all I have to do is go to the repository where I set up my webhook, create a new issue, and wait for the printer to deliver a ticket :magic:.\n\nAlright, so where to go from here? This is definitely a simple proof of concept, but we can expand on it a few different ways.\n\nFor the tickets themselves, a QR code could be added to link directly to the issue on GitHub. You could also add in more details from the issue itself like tags and severity.\n\nYou could also use this concept to handle basically any data coming from a webhook or through an API request. Like printing tickets from apps like Jira or Bugsnag, exceptions thrown from production applications, or even daily todo items and grocery lists!\n\nSo, what do you think? If you have any ideas for how you'd improve on this setup, or just have a question or comment, please let me know in the discussion below or on my Twitter!\n\nSubscribe using the form below and about 1-2 times a month you'll receive an email containing helpful hints, new packages, and interesting articles I've found on PHP, JavaScript, Docker and more.",

    "fullText": "MARGRATEN, Netherlands (AP) — Ever since a U.S. military cemetery in the southern Netherlands removed two displays recognizing Black troops who helped to liberate Europe from the Nazis, visitors have filled the guestbook with objections.\n\nSometime in the spring, the American Battle Monuments Commission, the U.S. government agency responsible for maintaining memorial sites outside of the United States, removed the panels from the visitors center at the American Cemetery in Margraten, the final resting place for roughly 8,300 U.S. soldiers, set in rolling hills near the border with Belgium and Germany.\n\nThe move came after U.S. President Donald Trump issued a series of executive orders ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs. “Our country will be woke no longer,” Trump said in an address to Congress in March.\n\nThe removal, carried out without public explanation, has angered Dutch officials, the families of U.S. soldiers and the local residents who honor the American sacrifice by caring for the graves.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands Joe Popolo seemed to support the removal of the displays. “The signs at Margraten are not intended to promote an agenda that criticizes America,” he wrote on social media following a visit to the cemetery after the controversy had erupted. Popolo declined a request for comment.\n\nThe displays highlighted the sacrifices of Black Americans\n\nOne display told the story of 23-year-old George H. Pruitt, a Black soldier buried at the cemetery, who died attempting to rescue a comrade from drowning in 1945. The other described the U.S. policy of racial segregation in place during World War II.\n\nSome 1 million Black soldiers enlisted in the U.S. military during the war, serving in separate units, mostly doing menial tasks but also fighting in some combat missions. An all-Black unit dug the thousands of graves in Margraten during the brutal 1944-45 season of famine in the German-occupied Netherlands known in the Hunger Winter.\n\nCor Linssen, the 79-year-old son of a Black American soldier and a Dutch mother, is one of those who opposes the removal of the panels.\n\nLinssen grew up some 30 miles (50 kilometers) away from the cemetery and although he didn’t learn who his father was until later in life, he knew he was the son of a Black soldier.\n\n“When I was born, the nurse thought something was wrong with me because I was the wrong color,” he told The Associated Press. “I was the only dark child at school.”\n\nLinssen together with a group of other children of Black soldiers, now all in their 70s and 80s, visited the cemetery in February 2025 to see the panels.\n\n“It’s an important part of history,” Linssen said. “They should put the panels back.\"\n\nThe decision was based on Trump's DEI policies\n\nAfter months of mystery around the disappearance of the panels, two media organizations — the Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA) and online media Dutch News — this month published emails obtained through a U.S. Freedom of Information Act request showing that Trump’s DEI policies directly prompted the commission to take down the panels.\n\nThe White House did not respond to queries from AP about the removed panels.\n\nThe American Battle Monuments Commission did not respond to queries from AP about the revelations. Earlier, the ABMC told the AP that the panel that discussed segregation “did not fall within (the) commemorative mission.''\n\nIt also said that the panel about Pruitt was “rotated” out. The replacement panel features Leslie Loveland, a white soldier killed in Germany in 1945, who is buried at Margraten.\n\nChair of the Black Liberators foundation and Dutch senator Theo Bovens said his organization, which pushed for the inclusion of the panels at the visitors center, was not informed that they were removed. He told AP it is “strange” that the U.S. commission feels the panels are not in their mission, as they placed them in 2024.\n\n“Something has changed in the United States,” he said.\n\nBovens, who is from the region around Margraten, is one of thousands of locals who tend to the graves at the cemetery. People who adopt a grave visit it regularly and leave flowers on the fallen soldier’s birthday and other holidays. The responsibility is often passed down through Dutch families, and there is a waiting list to adopt graves of the U.S. soldiers.\n\nThe locals remember the sacrifices of the Black soldiers\n\nBoth the city and the province where the cemetery is located have demanded the panels be returned. In November a Dutch television program recreated the panels and installed them outside the cemetery, where they were quickly removed by police. The show is now seeking a permanent location for them.\n\nThe Black Liberators is also looking to find a permanent location for a memorial for the Black soldiers who gave their lives to free the Dutch.\n\nOn America Square, in front of the Eijsden-Margraten city hall, there is a small park named for Jefferson Wiggins, a Black solider who, at age 19, dug many of the graves at Margraten when he was stationed in the Netherlands.\n\nIn his memoir, published posthumously in 2014, he describes burying the bodies of his white comrades who he was barred from fraternizing with while they were alive.\n\nWhen Black soldiers came to Europe in the Second World War, ’’what they found was people who accepted them, who welcomed them, who treated them as the heroes that they were. And that includes the Netherlands,″ said Linda Hervieux, whose book “Forgotten” chronicles Black soldiers who fought on D-Day and segregation they faced back home.\n\nThe removal of the panels, she said, “follows a historical pattern of writing out the stories of men and women of color in the United States.\"",

    "fullText": "A familiar fast-food destination on State Street in Boise went dark over the weekend. But something hot — in more ways than one — will brighten up its future.\n\nCarl’s Jr. just closed its prominent, standalone restaurant at 1700 W. State St., across from an Albertsons grocery store.\n\nSpicing up the building, Dave’s Hot Chicken plans to open there next.\n\nSpecializing in Nashville-style hot chicken tenders and sliders, Dave’s was founded in 2017 as a California pop-up. Since then, the fast-casual chain has exploded. “When a restaurant starts in an East Hollywood parking lot and ends up with nearly 1,000 locations in development, you know something epic is underway,” food website Tasting Table recently proclaimed. “Dave’s Hot Chicken has become the poster child for explosive growth in the restaurant industry, and 2025 is proving to be its biggest year yet.”\n\nIdaho franchisees Doug and Amy Davis introduced Dave’s Hot Chicken to the Gem State with a Meridian restaurant in 2022 and a Nampa store in 2024. But Doug Davis — the man who brought Buffalo Wild Wings to Idaho before parting ways with that brand in 2015 — has always had his eye on the City of Trees.\n\n“I will bring it to Boise,” he told the Statesman in early 2024. “I guarantee that.”\n\nBut North End fans of Dave’s Hot Chicken — not to mention Boise High School students — will have to be patient. “I hope to be open mid-August 2026,” Davis explained in a message.\n\nIt’s hard to view the Dave’s-for-Carl’s trade as anything less than a win for fast-food fans. And the neighborhood itself. The building, which is nearly 4,000 square feet, will be modernized by Dave’s Hot Chicken’s stylish street-mural look. “Our concept is a locally owned and operated franchise, deeply connected to the spirit of Boise and the North End,” according to information that Davis submitted to the city of Boise. “Public art reflects Boise’s unique character, and Dave’s street art embodies that spirit.”\n\nThe building also will be remodeled, “minimizing structural changes and optimizing existing infrastructure. The drive-thru will remain an essential service component and continue to operate under the new concept.\n\n“In addition to the main dining and kitchen areas, the project will incorporate approximately 1,500 square feet of currently unoccupied space into the restaurant’s footprint. Consistent with the approach taken at our Meridian location, this area will be repurposed to include a climate-controlled indoor/outdoor patio as well as a new conference room and storage space.\n\n“The patio will feature attractive garage-style doors, allowing the space to function as an open-air dining environment in favorable weather, while heating and cooling systems will ensure comfortable, year-round use.\n\n“Interior upgrades will include new finishes, equipment installations, and modifications to meet Dave’s Hot Chicken’s prototype standards. Exterior improvements will focus on refreshed branding, signage, and design enhancements that align with the franchise’s identity while complementing the surrounding area.”\n\nThe demise of Carl’s Jr. on State Street follows the closure of another location last year at 226 S. Broadway Ave. — the first Carl’s Jr. in Idaho. The year before that, Carl’s Jr. also closed at 4999 W. Glenwood St. in Garden City.\n\nBut if you’re craving a Carl’s Jr. hamburger? There are still plenty of options. The chain continues to operate Treasure Valley locations in Boise, Meridian, Eagle and Nampa.",

    "fullText": "LAKE SUPERIOR, MI - A remote Michigan lighthouse sitting far offshore in Lake Superior has recorded one of today’s highest wind gusts amid a severe winter storm and blizzard conditions across the Upper Peninsula.\n\nWeather equipment on the Stannard Rock Lighthouse recorded a wind gust of 69 mph this morning. According to lists compiled by the National Weather Service, it’s the third-highest gust recorded so far during this storm. The highest gusts have been recorded as 72 mph in Sault Ste. Marie and 70 mph at Ford River near Escanaba.\n\nThe historic Stannard Rock Lighthouse sits off the eastern shore of Michigan’s Keweenaw Peninsula. Today, a Gale Warning has been issued for those Lake Superior waters until later tonight. Wind gusts as high as 57 mph are possible today, amid waves reaching 25 feet.\n\nBuilt 24 miles from the Upper Peninsula shoreline, Stannard Rock is considered the lighthouse farthest from shore in the contiguous United States. That has earned it the grim moniker as “The Loneliest Place in the World.”\n\nHistory of “The Loneliest Place in the World.”\n\nBuilt in 1883, the Stannard Rock station is well-known among Great Lakes lighthouse lore lovers. Its exposed crib - or base structure - is considered one of the Top 10 engineering feats in the U.S., according to the National Park Service. And it was built to mark a huge underwater reef that was considered one of the most dangerous obstacles to shipping in Lake Superior. The top of a large underwater mountain was found to sit just 4 feet from the surface of the water in some spots.\n\nHere’s a little more history to give you a feel for this place, courtesy of a social media post from the U.S. Coast Guard Station Marquette:\n\n“The old keepers told terrible tales of life on the Rock. Violent northwest storms sent 30-foot waves smashing into the tower and spray cascading over the lantern room 110 feet above the Lake. Louis Wilks from Marquette holds the record for consecutive time spent on the Rock – 99 days. No other keeper even approached this remarkable feat. The men were rotated off the Rock, three weeks on and one off. In 1939, the U.S. Coast Guard took over the lighthouse and overwhelming loneliness remained a problem.”\n\nThe lighthouse was automated in 1962, a year after a fatal fire and explosion that left survivors stranded at Stannard Rock for days until they were noticed by a passing ship. In 1971, the lighthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nIt remains a working aid to navigation. While the lighthouse is closed to the public, it can be seen by boat or airplane.\n\nIf emergency repairs are needed in the winter, the U.S Coast Guard will use a helicopter to fly a team to the lighthouse.\n\nDetroit Forecast: Arctic cold and more snow ahead\n\n2 more rounds of lake effect snow before New Year’s Day\n\nNearly 100,000 remain without power across Michigan after one-two punch of ice, high winds",

    "fullText": "Among the wildest sights in aviation is a high-performance aircraft taking off from a lake or the sea.\n\nThe exciting ability to take off from water frees aeroplanes from needing a runway, airfield, or airport. It offers incredible flexibility but comes at a huge cost, as a seaplane must also function as a boat.\n\nThis adds weight and involves large hydrodynamic, aerodynamic, configuration, and structural compromises, yet somehow, quite miraculously, some were built that offered impressive speed. One even held the absolute world airspeed record for all types of aeroplanes… Let’s take a look:\n\nThe German attack on Norway in 1940 and the alarming lack of RAF airfields to use in the resultant campaign made the need for a floatplane fighter one of the highest orders. An urgent scheme to fit floats from the Blackburn Roc to the Spitfire was hatched, but before these new Spitfire floatplanes even flew, the Norwegian campaign was over, and there was a more significant need for landplanes.\n\nThe converted Spitfires were changed back to regular wheeled undercarriage. But this handy idea refused to go away. Subsequently, the Spitfire floatplane was looked at again when war in the Pacific against Japan kicked off in late 1941, and this time a Mk.V, was converted.\n\nIn 1944, a Spitfire Mark IX (serial MJ892) powered by a Merlin 45 engine was fitted with floats. The result was spectacular: the machine reached 377mph, making it the fastest floatplane of the war. Sadly, the concept was shelved, and despite becoming the third fastest floatplane ever built, the waterborne Spitfire was abandoned in late 1945.\n\nThe Saunders-Roe SR.45 Princess was a magnificent machine of epic proportions. Weighing 86,000 kg, the same as 33 Spitfires, and with a greater wingspan than a Boeing 747, blessed with an endurance of 15 hours and a range of almost 6000 miles, the Princess was utterly impressive.\n\nThe Princess was planned as a luxurious airliner to serve the transatlantic route. To carry 100 passengers over such a long route in style, the Princess needed to be big and heavy and required a massive amount of power. Eight massive Bristol Proteus turboprop engines were mounted in four ‘coupled’ pairs, along with two regular uncoupled Proteus.\n\nThe Princess first flew in 1952, unfortunately coinciding with the dawn of the land-based jet airliner age. Large airports and runways, able to accommodate the far more efficient land planes, were becoming increasingly common. The Princess, though impressive, was the last and grandest example of a dying concept that was rapidly becoming obsolete.\n\nRemarkably, despite the myriad compromises a flying boat must endure, the Princess was capable of a racy 380 mph, a mere 69mph slower than the jet-powered land-based de Havilland Comet I. Saunders-Roe were nothing if not persistent and considered even larger (jet-powered) flying boats before finally accepting defeat, and moving to another technological cul-de-sac: mixed propulsion fighters.\n\nBefore RJ Mitchell designed the Spitfire, he unleashed a series of stupendously fast floatplanes for the Schneider Trophy race. The S.5 had won the race in 1927 but was not considered competitive for the race of 1929 and Mitchell designed a successor powered by a new and very powerful Rolls-Royce V12 engine.\n\nThe new S.6 was delivered only a month before the race, mainly due to problems with the Rolls-Royce ‘R’ engine. Although offering huge potential, it was a capricious unit but had finally been tamed to an acceptable state of reliability by race day.\n\nThe S.6 obliterated the competition to win the 1929 Schneider Trophy, coming in 60mph faster than the second placed Macchi MC.67. Further tweaks to the R-type engine led it to deliver a huge 2350 hp in the S.6B which won the trophy outright for the UK in 1931.\n\nAs a final flourish, the sensational S.6B proved it was as fast as it was beautiful by setting the world absolute speed record at 407.5mph, becoming the fastest man-made vehicle yet built in the process. Incredibly, it remains one of the two fastest floatplanes ever constructed nearly 100 years later.\n\nJet seaplanes are among the most exotic aircraft types, with only a handful of designs ever having entered actual service. In fact, I’m pretty sure we can name them all from memory: the Beriev Be-10 and Beriev Be-200 – wait, I think that’s it; only two?\n\nThe only one remaining in service today is the Be-200. Based on the rather unfortunate Beriev A-40 (which we’ll cover later), the Be-200 first flew in 1998. It was designed for various roles, including firefighting, air ambulance, search and rescue, maritime patrol and transportation duties.\n\nOnly around 20 of these rather pretty amphibians have been built so far. The first operational use of the Be-200 was in 2004, when SOREM deployed a Be-200ES from Sardinia. The aircraft, flown by a joint Russian-Italian flight crew, performed over 100 flights and dropped 324 tons of water to counter four forest fires.\n\nSince then, the aircraft has fought fires worldwide, in Israel, Portugal, Greece, Serbia, Russia and other locations. It can carry a maximum of 12,000 litres (3,200 US gal) of water. The Be-200 is operated by Algeria, Azerbaijan, and Russia.\n\nOn 23 October 1934, Francesco Agello became the fastest man that had ever been when he took the stunningly beautiful MC.72 to a speed of 440.682 mph (709.209km/h). Packed into the long nose of the MC.72 was a 2800-horsepower monster: the engine is two separate units really, mounted inline, each driving one of the contra-rotating propellers.\n\nThe luscious Italian Macchi-Castoldi M.C.72 combined a wealth of innovative features with outstanding beauty and a quite astonishing performance. It was built to win the Schneider race, a fiercely competitive international seaplane contest encouraging rapid technological progress in aeroplane development.\n\nAlthough conceived to contest the 1931 Schneider Trophy, the M.C.72 ruled itself out by being too late - however it did go on to set an outright speed record that stood for five years. The journey to success wasn’t easy though, with Fiat’s A.S.6 24-cylinder engine being the main culprit.\n\nThe A.S.6 was an alarming idea: take two highly-strung V12 engines and bolt them back-to-back, having one drive one element of a contra-rotating prop and the other drive the second, with no direct link between the throttles. A speed of 440.68mph was set in 1933, only bettered in 1939 (by a German landplane), and it’s still the case that no piston-engined seaplane has travelled faster.\n\nThe Beriev Aircraft Company started as a Soviet design bureau specialising in amphibious aircraft. When the jet age arrived, the Beriev had been building seaplanes for some time. The new technology promised a massive leap in speed, so Beriev set about designing a jet-flying boat.\n\nThe R-1 first flew on 20 May 1952, powered by two Klimov VK-1 turbojet engines, each rated at 26.5 kilonewtons (5950 lbf). Capable of an impressive 500 mph, and armed with two forward-firing and two tail-mounted 23-mm cannon, and up to 1000 kg of munitions. The single prototype suffered from severe vibrations and instability on water and crashed in 1953.\n\nThe Soviet Beriev A-40 amphibious jet flying boat first flew in 1986, and it was intended that it would replace the Beriev Be-12 (and land-based Ilyushin Il-38) in the anti-submarine warfare role. Between 1989 and 1998, the Beriev A-40 set 140 in-class world records.\n\nVarious attempts were made to get the aircraft into Russian service, but they all failed. The most recent effort of a modernised version involved new Ukrainian-made propfan engines, an effort which ended with Russian aggression against Ukraine; Russian forces bombed and destroyed the engine plant in May 2022.\n\nThe Japanese floatplane fighters of the war showed that the concept could work, at least to some degree, in the calmer parts of the Pacific. British manufacturer Saunders-Roe thought they could do one better, negating the seaplane’s inherent performance disadvantage with the latest technology: the jet engine.\n\nCreating an aircraft capable of 512 mph with four 20-mm cannon would have proved an awesome, perhaps unbeatable, opponent to Japanese seaplanes and flying boats. Timing was against the aircraft; however, with the war winding down, the company looked away from this military project, instead devoting their resources to the huge, long-range, civilian flying boat, the Princess. This delayed the type’s first flight until 1947.\n\nThe aircraft proved impressive – it had great handling, good agility and was pleasant to fly Notably, the prototypes were fitted with the first two examples of Martin-Baker production ejection seats. However, there wasn’t a great deal of need for it by this time, and two months later, a carrier fighter that was faster still (the 600mph Hawker Sea Hawk) took to the air.\n\nThe Royal Navy wasn’t very interested in this eccentric design, believing in the conventional carrier concept. It was briefly brought back to life in 1950 to assess its utility for the Korean War, but things had moved on, and it would have been no match for the latest fighters. The ‘Squirt’, as it was affectionately known by its creators, was not to be. Three examples were built.\n\nThe Beriev Be-10 ‘Mallow’ was a turbojet-powered flying boat designed for reconnaissance, bomber, torpedo attack and mine-laying missions. The first flight of this dramatic-looking aeroplane with its swept-back wing was on 20 June 1956 from Gelendzhik, on the Black Sea, in Russia.\n\nThe first turbo-jet flying boat to enter service, the Be-10 was a massive step up in performance from the piston-engined flying boats that preceded it, like the Be-6. Offering a top speed more than twice as fast, it smashed 12 in-class world records in speed, altitude, and payload, which still stand today.\n\nIt was powered by two Lyul’ka AL-7B turbojets, each rated at 71.26 kilonewtons (16,000lbf). Unlike other AL-7 installations on various fighters, the AL-7B had stainless steel compressor blades and no afterburner fitted. It was armed with four 23-mm automatic cannons, with a maximum bombload of 3,000kg.\n\nIt was initially beset with a multitude of problems, including engine water and gun-gas ingestion, quality control issues, and it suffered a relatively high accident rate. Only 28 aircraft were made and served only two squadrons within the 977th Independent Naval Long-Range Reconnaissance Air Regiment.\n\nTwo 1950s quad-jet bombers were designed for high speed at low level: one was the British Valiant B2, and the other was the far more exotic American Martin P6M SeaMaster. This was planned as a strategic bomber and minelayer for the U.S. Navy, able to fly just above the waves at near supersonic speeds and destroy enemy submarines in their homeports.\n\nThis high performance ‘on the deck’ was excellent for any aircraft that first flew in 1955, even more so for a machine weighting an 44,300 kg that could take-off from water. Intended as part of a new Seaplane Strike Force, the SeaMaster was a bold design that inherited the t-tail (or tee tail) and rotating weapons bay from the failed Martin XB-51 bomber.\n\nThe SeaMaster was late, over budget, riddled with technical challenges, and was cancelled. The new Polaris Submarine-launched ballistic missile offered a cheaper and less risky alternative. The project cost a staggering $400 million, equivalent to almost $5 billion in today’s money.\n\nOnly 16 SeaMasters were built. The project’s failure drove the Glenn L. Martin Company, established in 1917, out of the aircraft business, despite attempts to market an extremely exciting (and unbuilt) civil version, the SeaMistress.\n\nHigh-performance jet combat aircraft of the 1950s required long runways, and tended to have rather unforgiving handling characteristics. This made them dangerous for land-based operations; aircraft carrier operations were even more hazardous. Convair believed the solution was a fast jet seaplane that took off from water.\n\nThe sleek delta-winged Sea Dart launching or landing on the ocean was one of the most compelling sights, even in a decade bursting with aerospace spectacle. Thrust skywards by two jet engines, the Sea Dart was designed as a fighter interceptor for the United States Navy.\n\nWith its delta wing and sleek uncluttered lines, it was a revelation when it appeared in 1953. It looked a world apart from the seaplanes of the war that had only ended eight years earlier. Despite being a seaplane, it was only marginally slower than the fastest aircraft flying and could be dived to Mach 1.25, making it the only supersonic seaplane in history.\n\nHowever, even higher speeds were desired, including supersonic speed in level flight, which it could not achieve. It was also relatively sluggish in agility. Even worse, its legged ‘hydro-ski’ take-offs almost shook the poor pilot to death. Still, it was a fantastic machine, capable of 695mph. Five examples were produced.\n\nFollow Joe Coles on Substack, Twitter X  or Blue Sky.

    "description": "Having a scalable truck-based catapult concept for land-launched larger drone operations could open up new operational possibilities.",
    "fullText": "New imagery of Chinese catapult-capable low-observable combat drones, or possibly mockups thereof, together with some unusual trucks, may point to plans to launch them from the ground, as well as ships. A modular, truck-mounted electromagnetic catapult system would offer a valuable additional way to launch larger drones, especially in areas with limited access to traditional runways. General Atomics in the United States has proposed a roughly similar concept in the past, leveraging technology developed for the U.S. Navy’s Ford class aircraft carriers.\n\nPictures of the drones sitting dockside at Hudong-Zhonghua shipyard in Shanghai first began circulating online late last week. The presence of the super-sized Type 076 amphibious assault ship Sichuan in drydock nearby still raises the possibility of plans for trials aboard that ship, which features a single electromagnetic catapult, as was discussed in TWZ‘s initial reporting here. A medium-sized cargo ship loaded with containerized vertical launchers, as well as sensors and close-in defense systems, which emerged last week, has also been moored at this yard recently.\n\nThough the drones are still under wraps in the new images, we do now have a better look at their overall design. This includes nose landing gear with bars that clearly show the design is intended for catapult launch. There is also a notable outline of a fairing under the nose, though no further details about that feature can be discerned at present.\n\nIt is interesting to note that a mockup of a drone called the FH-97, shown at China’s Zhuhai Airshow in 2021, was depicted with an electro-optical sensor in a stealthy gold-plated windowed enclosure installed under its nose. The overall design of the FH-97, which is at least heavily inspired by the XQ-58A Valkyrie from U.S. drone maker Kratos, is similar in many other respects, at least in broad strokes, to what has now been seen at the Hudong-Zhonghua shipyard. The XQ-58 and FH-97 are both notably smaller designs. There are also similarities to two Chinese ‘loyal wingman’ type drone designs, commonly referred to presently as the Type C and Type E, which emerged around a huge military parade in Beijing back in September.\n\nWell, back from work and back to this strange picture:\n\nI start with my layman's attempt to sort them a bit + adding the names according to Huitong's CMA-Blog.\n\n1. pic.twitter.com/GPXjD2q1r3\n\n— @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) September 10, 2025\n\nMore interestingly, the new pictures from Hudong-Zhonghua shipyard show at least three eight-wheeled trucks that look designed to lock together seamlessly in a chain. Doing so also appears to form a continuous flat surface across the top. One of the drones is seen loaded at the rear of one of the trucks with its nose gear bar locked into what looks to be a catapult shuttle.\n\nBesides the cabs in front, the sides of the trucks are largely open, showing elaborate electrical systems and large amounts of heavy exposed wiring. There is a cylindrical drum above each wheel, which could be part of an independent articulating suspension system capable of self-leveling. They might also serve another purpose, which we will come back to later on.\n\nA satellite image taken yesterday, which TWZ obtained from Planet Labs, shows what looks to be at least four of the trucks parked close together in a line along one of the piers at Hudong-Zhonghua shipyard. Despite the low resolution, a drone is plainly seen loaded on one of the trucks. Another one of the ‘loyal wingman’ drones is visible immediately behind the row of trucks, in line with what is seen in the pictures taken at ground level. Four more of the swept-wing drones are also visible further down the pier. A Wing Loong-type drone, similar to the Q-1/Q-9 Predator/Reaper series, is also present.\n\nAltogether, there is the potential that these trucks could be part of a mobile ground-based electromagnetic catapult system. The cylinders and wiring seen on the trucks might be electromagnets and/or other supporting components. Any such system would also need to be self-leveling to help ensure a clean launch.\n\nAt the same time, they could still just be transporters, though the design looks far more elaborate than would be required for that purpose alone. The trucks could possibly be designed to serve both functions.\n\nThere is the additional question of why, if this is indeed a ground-based electromagnetic catapult system, it has been brought down to Hudong-Zhonghua shipyard at all. This is not the environment in which one would expect such a system to be employed, and there are no clear signs as of yet that it is there as part of a larger display.\n\nRegardless, the basic idea of employing an aircraft carrier-type catapult launch system on land is not new. China itself, as well as the United States, has built steam and electromagnetic-powered catapults at land-based test sites for test, evaluation, and training purposes. The U.S. Marine Corps actually employed an ‘aircraft carrier on land’ with catapults and arresting gear, called the Short Airfield for Tactical Support (SATS) system, operationally during the Vietnam War, which you can read more about here.\n\nAt least one company in China, Tiantao Technology, has been openly talking about plans for a ground-based electromagnetic catapult system made up of modular wheeled segments since at least August of this year. Renderings have shown 10-wheeled sections that do have some broad similarities to, but that also are distinctly different from the eight-wheeled trucks seen at Hudong-Zhonghua shipyard. The eight-wheeled trucks, if they are part of a mobile electromagnetic catapult system, could also reflect an early developmental iteration.\n\nTiantao Technology has also reportedly said the system will be capable of launching uncrewed aircraft weighing up to around 2.2 tons (two metric tons). This is lighter than the expected takeoff weights of ‘loyal wingman’ type drones China has shown to date, based on the known specifications of comparably-sized Western designs. For example, the stated maximum launch weight of the XQ-58 is three tons, according to Kratos. As another point of comparison, the Chinese GJ-11, a larger flying-wing uncrewed combat air vehicle (UCAV), a catapult-capable version of which is now in development, reportedly has a payload capacity of around two tons. China’s J-15 family of crewed carrier-based fighters, derived from the Su-33 Flanker, each weighs around 19 tons (17.5 metric tons) empty without any fuel or ordnance, as well.\n\nHere are apparently some specs of truck mounted EMALS\n\nCan launch 2T mass with 150kN thrust https://t.co/xoxLOYO0oNpic.twitter.com/vEXM2iSeq4\n\n— Hûrin (@Hurin92) December 29, 2025\n\nIt is possible that the modular design of Tiantao Technology’s ground-based catapult system could allow for configurations capable of launching heavier designs. A core benefit of electromagnetic catapults over steam-powered ones, in general, is their ability to be more fine-tuned in terms of the forces they exert on any aircraft during launch. The capabilities of a modular system would also be dependent on its exact configuration, including how long the catapult track is overall. Tiantao Technology has said the total length of its system could be scaled between roughly 65 and 196 feet (20 and 60 meters). What limitations there might be on simply adding more segments to increase launch capacity are unknown.\n\nChina’s aircraft carrier electromagnetic catapult is incredibly cool — the moment the catapult comes to an instant stop looks like a space jump straight out of a sci-fi movie. pic.twitter.com/VWdLOEzgzS\n\n— JacksonS (@shrmodelx) December 25, 2025\n\nTiantao Technology has also shown models and renderings of truck and trailer-mounted electromagnetic catapults for launching even smaller drones. How much progress it has made in the actual development of any of the systems to date is unclear. Other firms in China could very well be working along similar lines, too.\n\nAll this being said, a ground-based electromagnetic catapult system capable of launching even two-ton drones still opens doors to new operational possibilities. This is a capability that could be especially valuable in expeditionary scenarios or other contexts in which access to traditional runways is limited. A mobile system would also offer a new way to push at least a certain tier of airpower closer to the front lines, and help keep it in close proximity where it could be more responsive, even as the dimensions of the battlefield evolve. Less transit time would translate to more on-station endurance even for smaller, shorter-range drones.\n\nAnother general benefit of electromagnetic catapults over steam-powered types is the shorter reset time, which, by extension, increases sortie generation rates. How Tiantao Technology envisions drones being loaded on its ground-based system is unclear. It is possible that a truck preloaded with a drone could drive up, lock into the rear of the track, launch, and then detach to make way for the next one, offering additional benefits when it comes to operational tempo. Being able to break the launch system into multiple parts and disperse it when not in use would create targeting challenges for enemies and help increase survivability, as well.\n\nAs TWZ regularly notes, China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has major standing requirements to be able to conduct island-hopping campaigns against various potential opponents in the Pacific, where a shore-based electromagnetic catapult system could be particularly relevant. The PLA is also postured to fight in highly remote and high-altitude areas along its disputed western border with India, where access to established runways is also often limited.\n\nThese kinds of operational scenarios are driving the pursuit of aircraft, especially uncrewed types, with reduced runway requirements or entirely runway-independent designs by many armed forces globally. This includes the U.S. military. A ground-based electromagnetic catapult is just one way of approaching this operational need. There are runway-independent drones already on the market today that are launched with the help of expendable rocket motors or pneumatic catapults. However, these methods impose their own limitations, especially when it comes to launch weight and payload capacity. Rocket-assisted takeoffs come along with the additional risks associated with using that kind of propellant, as well as the stresses that are imparted on the aircraft being launched. The rockets are also consumed on launch, requiring a steady supply of them at any operating location. Kratos has notably demonstrated a special launch trolley for its primarily rocket-launched XQ-58 that allows for traditional runway takeoffs. The company is also developing a version of that design with built-in landing gear, to offer increased flexibility.\n\nIn the context of what may now be in development in China, there is the additional question about how drones might be recovered after launch from a ground-based electromagnetic catapult. Tiantao Technology does not appear to have elaborated yet on this part of the expected concept of operations for its system. The aforementioned concept that General Atomics put forward paired an electromagnetic catapult with a separate arrested landing system, also based on technology developed for the U.S. Navy’s Ford class aircraft carriers. As noted, the Vietnam War-era SATS system also included arresting gear. The U.S. military and other armed forces globally already employ deployable arresting gear, especially to enable crewed tactical jet operations from far-flung locations with shorter runways. Drones could recover at tertiary bases, or be designed to land via parachute or some other runway-independent method, as well. The system could also be used to launch long-range one-way attack drones that would not be designed for recovery at all.\n\nThere is also a question of power and other logistical requirements. However, a ground-based electromagnetic catapult system that is not required to support all of the different types in a full carrier air wing, especially larger crewed aircraft, would inherently require far less capability.\n\nIt is also worth noting that a modular electromagnetic catapult system might be usable on ships that do not have this capability built into their design. As mentioned, the drones and trucks seen at Hudong-Zhonghua shipyard were spotted near a cargo ship loaded with various containerized weapons and other systems. A drone launch capability of some kind would be a logical addition to a vessel with that configuration. At the same time, whether or not any catapult system made up of multiple segmented components would be stable enough for use on a ship rocking back and forth at sea is unclear.\n\nAs a general note, major new military capabilities often emerge in China during the time between Christmas and New Year’s. This is also something that happens with the clear acquiescence of authorities in Beijing if they are not outright announced through official channels. Hudong-Zhonghua shipyard is an obvious area of interest for observers, and Chinese authorities do not appear to have taken any special steps to conceal the recent appearance of the drone mockups or the trucks.\n\nMore details about the trucks, and their exact function, as well as the drones, may now begin to emerge.\n\nContact the author: joe@twz.com",

    "fullText": "TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — It is a soulful folk song, filled with feeling and history: A love-stricken young man tells God about his hopes and dreams of happiness. Generations of Uyghurs, the Turkic ethnic minority in China’s Xinjiang region, have played it at parties and weddings.\n\nBut today, if they download it, play it or share it online, they risk ending up in prison.\n\n“Besh pede,” a popular Uyghur folk ballad, is among dozens of Uyghur-language songs that have been deemed “problematic” by Xinjiang authorities, according to a recording of a meeting held by police and other local officials in the historic city of Kashgar last October. The recording was shared exclusively with The Associated Press by the Norway-based nonprofit Uyghur Hjelp.\n\nDuring the meeting, authorities warned residents that those who listened to banned songs, stored them on devices or shared them on social media could face prison. Attendees were also instructed to avoid phrases like “As-salamu alaykum,” the greeting common among Muslims, and to replace the popular farewell phrase “Allahqa amanet,” which means “May God keep you safe,” with “May the Communist Party protect you.”\n\nThe policy has been corroborated by interviews with former Xinjiang residents, whose family members, friends and acquaintances have been detained for playing and sharing Uyghur music. AP has also obtained rare access to the court verdict of a Uyghur music producer sentenced last year to three years in prison for uploading to his cloud account songs deemed sensitive.\n\nHow a single song fits into a broad crackdown\n\nThe renewed crackdown on cultural expression in Xinjiang, classified as an “autonomous region” but tightly controlled by the central government, suggests a continuation of the past decade's repressive policies. They have culminated in the extrajudicial detention, between 2017 and 2019, of at least 1 million Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in China such as Kazakhs, Kyrgyz and Huis, rights activists and foreign governments say.\n\nIn 2022, the United Nations accused China of rights violations it said might amount to crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, where Beijing also faces allegations of forced labor, forced sterilizations and family separations as part of a broader assimilation campaign.\n\nThe Chinese government maintains its policies in Xinjiang rooted out terrorism and religious extremism after sporadic bouts of violence rocked the region in previous decades. Beijing doubled down on that narrative in particular after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks brought antiterror policies into the accepted global mainstream.\n\n“The Chinese government has cracked down on violent terrorist crimes and eradicated the breeding ground for religious extremism in accordance with the law, resolutely safeguarding Xinjiang’s development and stability,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.\n\nIt added that “anti-China forces” have “maliciously hyped up issues related to Xinjiang,” including by “linking audio and video recordings of Xinjiang departments cracking down on the propaganda of violent terrorism and religious extremism in accordance with the law to specific regions, ethnicities, and religions.”\n\nReached by phone, a Xinjiang government official wouldn't confirm whether a faxed request for comment had arrived and did not pick up subsequent calls from AP.\n\nA sign of continued repression in Xinjiang\n\nAfter facing international backlash and sanctions over the alleged arbitrary internment of ethnic minorities, Beijing in late 2019 claimed the detention camps were closed and life had returned to normal in the region. China now aims to refashion Xinjiang into a destination for tourism.\n\nAlthough many of the more glaring signs of repression such as internment camps and frequent traffic checkpoints appear to have been decommissioned, the list of banned songs indicates repression in Xinjiang continues, albeit more subtly, said Rian Thum, a senior lecturer in East Asian history at the University of Manchester.\n\nOther, less conspicuous forms of control include the expansion of boarding schools, where middle-schoolers are educated while separated from their families and learn almost exclusively in Mandarin Chinese, and random checks of phones for sensitive material are common.\n\nChinese authorities, Thum said, seem to be normalizing a policy for long-term control in Xinjiang.\n\n“I’m not at all surprised to hear these accounts of people either being threatened with detention or being detained or imprisoned for listening to the wrong music,” he said. “It’s the kind of thing that hasn’t stopped.”\n\nSeven categories of ‘problematic’ songs\n\nDuring the Kashgar meeting, authorities played a prerecorded message warning residents against listening to, downloading and sharing seven categories of so-called problematic songs.\n\nThey range from traditional folk ballads such as “Besh pede” to newer tunes that emerged from the Uyghur diaspora. “Besh pede” was flagged for its religious content, though the song hardly incites religious extremism, said Rachel Harris, a professor of ethnomusicology at SOAS University of London.\n\nReligion is referenced in the context of romantic tropes, with exhortations such as “Oh, God, I love you!” said Harris, who focuses on Uyghur culture.\n\n“That’s very clearly the problem with it,\" she said.\n\nTargeting religious expression has been a cornerstone of China’s crackdown. The Communist Party is suspicious of any community organizing, especially as it pertains to religions. Over the past decade, residents have been detained for praying, fasting and storing religious books; mosques have been repurposed or stripped of their authentic role.\n\nMusic \"became part of my upbringing, and removing that is like removing the soul,” said Rahima Mahmut, a Uyghur singer and activist in London who performs songs with religious connotations abroad.\n\nEven songs once featured on state TV have been banned. “As-salamu alaykum,” a pop tune that starts with the Islamic greeting recited in the style of a call to prayer, was performed on the talent show “The Voice of the Silk Road,” a spinoff of “The Voice,” on state-run Xinjiang Television.\n\nThe performance aired in 2016, the year China started amping up its campaign of repression against Uyghurs. Now, the tune is prohibited for “forcing people to believe in religion.”\n\nAnother category of problematic songs: those “inciting terrorism, extremism and smearing the Chinese Communist Party’s rule of Xinjiang.” Among the tunes listed is “Yanarim Yoq,” a song based on the poem “No Road Back Home” by the imprisoned Uyghur poet Abduqadir Jalalidin. The sorrowful song, evoking entrapment and hopelessness, has spread across the diaspora in recent years; one of its most popular renditions is performed by the Turkish artists Kilich and Yenilmes.\n\n“Atilar,” or “Forefathers,” by the famed Uyghur musician Abdurehim Heyit, is also accused of inciting terrorism and extremism. The nationalistic song was likely flagged for describing the Uyghur forefathers as martyrs ready for battle, Harris said.\n\nHeyit, like many other Uyghur cultural elites, was detained at the height of China’s campaign in Xinjiang. Many remain in detention.\n\nIn fact, a common denominator across the banned songs is that many were written or performed by imprisoned Uyghur musicians, said Elise Anderson, a nonresident senior fellow at the New Lines Institute who specializes in Uyghur issues.\n\nAnderson isn't certain that every artist associated with a banned song has been detained, but “at least a number of them have,” she said. “I think just by association with those individuals, those songs are going to be seen as — you know — dangerous, sensitive.”\n\nThree years in prison for uploading songs\n\nAuthorities at the Kashgar meeting said those found with the songs would be “heavily prosecuted” but did not specify punishment — something that gives authorities flexibility in enforcement. The prerecorded message gave the example of several people who had served 10 days in detention for being found with the banned songs.\n\nFor Uyghur music producer Yashar Xiaohelaiti, punishment has been much more severe.\n\nThe 27-year-old was detained in 2023 in Bole, a city in Xinjiang, on charges of promoting extremism. According to his verdict, Xiaohelaiti wrote and produced 42 “problematic” songs, which he uploaded to his account on NetEase Cloud Music, a Chinese streaming service. He was also convicted of downloading eight “problematic” e-books, according to the document. He received three years in prison and a 3,000 yuan ($420) fine.\n\nTwo Uyghurs interviewed by AP said they brushed up against the songs ban themselves. A man who asked that his name not be revealed, fearing repercussions, said he was called into the police station and his phone searched after he commented on the social media post of another Uyghur living abroad. While at the police station, he said he spoke to others who had been summoned specifically for storing or sharing certain Uyghur songs.\n\nSeparately, a former official from Xinjiang said a family friend was sentenced to more than 10 years in prison for playing traditional Uyghur instruments and singing Uyghur songs. Several family members and friends who watched the performance were also sentenced, she said. AP could not independently verify the interviewees’ claims.\n\nIn a separate incident, the official said two teenagers were detained after sharing Uyghur songs online.\n\n“Because they sent each other a Uyghur song on WeChat, they were arrested,” the former cadre said, referring to the teens. “I remember it very clearly. At the time we were saying, ‘What song were they listening to?’ How could they be arrested for listening to a song?’”\n\nAP journalist Dake Kang in Beijing contributed to this story.",

The two neighboring countries have no formal diplomatic ties and their joint border has remained closed since the 1990s.\n\nThe two countries however, agreed to work toward normalization in 2021, appointing special envoys to explore steps toward reconciliation and reopening the frontier. Those talks have progressed in parallel with efforts to ease tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan.\n\nTurkey supported Azerbaijan during its 2020 conflict with Armenia for control of the Karabakh region, known internationally as Nagorno-Karabakh, a territorial dispute that had lasted nearly four decades.\n\nThe Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement posted on social platform X that Ankara and Yerevan agreed that holders of diplomatic, special and service passports from both countries would be able to obtain electronic visas free of charge as of Jan. 1.\n\n“On this occasion, Turkey and Armenia reaffirm once again their commitment to continue the normalization process between the two countries with the goal of achieving full normalization without any preconditions,” the ministry said.\n\nTurkey and Armenia also have a more than century-old dispute over the deaths of an estimated 1.5 million Armenians in massacres, deportations and forced marches that began in 1915 in Ottoman Turkey. Historians widely view the event as genocide.\n\nTurkey denies the deaths constituted genocide, saying the toll has been inflated and those killed were victims of civil war and unrest. It has lobbied to prevent countries from officially recognizing the massacres as genocide.",

    "fullText": "A teen who faced deportation in Denmark has said 54-year-old tech billionaire Elon Musk’s remarks about her “hotness” are “crazy.”\n\nIn a now-deleted X post from Sunday, Musk commented on the story of Audrey Morris, a now-19-year-old U.S. native who was at risk of deportation from the country where she’s mostly lived since she was 9 years old.\n\n“8 or above level hotness should get an exemption,” Musk wrote with a laughing emoji.\n\nMorris said she wasn’t “surprised” by Musk’s comment, but that “it’s definitely crazy.”\n\n“From the beginning, the second that my case was kind of made public, it has been about appearances and because, ‘oh, she’s blonde and she’s white!’ And so the thing he said in of itself wasn’t shocking to me, but coming from him, yes, it was definitely...I was floored,” she told the Daily Beast.\n\nThe Independent has reached out for comment from Musk and Morris.\n\nAccording to the Danish newspaper, Århus Stiftstidende, Morris has lived in Aarhus, a city on Denmark’s east coast, for most of her life.\n\nThe newspaper reported last January that Danish authorities had decided not to extend her residence permit as an accompanying family member because she was not living with her mother while completing high school in Viborg, about an hour’s drive northwest of Aarhus. At the time, Morris’ application for permanent residence was being processed.\n\n“It would’ve been really cool if he commented something like, ‘Oh wow, look how many academic things she’s reached,’ or whatever. That would’ve been great. It could have been so helpful,” Morris, originally from Los Angeles, said of Musk.\n\nBut she said “if this just at least brings it to the attention of anyone who cares, then I’m fine with being embarrassed a little bit. That’s okay.”\n\nThe Daily Beast reported Morris was ultimately given a 10-year residency permit but was denied citizenship.\n\nMusk, who had a small stint in the White House as head of Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency before his public fall out with the president, has made his stance on illegal immigration known, saying during the Biden administration that the influx of undocumented migrants was “crushing the country.”\n\nBut the Tesla and SpaceX CEO, who was born in South Africa and eventually gained American citizenship, has defended legal immigration, specifically H1-B visas. Musk said during a podcast with entrepreneur Nikhil Kamath that aired in late November that his companies use the temporary employment program because of the “scarcity of talented people.”",

    "title": "Do You Remember The Defunct Mexican Chain That Was Once The 2nd-Largest In America?",
    "description": "This Mexican restaurant chain was all the rage in the 1990s, but what went wrong? Here's what we know about this once-popular spot for Mexican food.",
    "fullText": "There are plenty of defunct '90s restaurant chains that should have stuck around longer, most of which quietly faded into oblivion before we had one last bite of our favorites. Don Pablo's might come to mind; it was the second-largest Mexican chain in America in the '90s, after all. During its heyday, it served 20 states with over 100 locations, which made it the closest competitor to Chi-Chi's. The first Don Pablo's location appeared in Texas in the mid-'80s, and due to its success, it started growing from there — so much so that seven years after its conception, it was already gaining traction with 10 stores.\n\nPerhaps what Don Pablo's was well-known for was its use of quality ingredients in the form of tacos, burritos, fajitas, salads, and more. It didn't hurt that the prices were quite affordable, too, which made family dinners at Don Pablo's even more appealing. Other than the food, the exceptional dining experience left an indelible mark, stirring up memories whenever you hear its name. You might remember your excitement from watching how tortillas were made, celebrating your seventh birthday, and seeing how the interiors were grand and a bit theatrical — which the chain allegedly even hired decorators for. Its stores saw frequent revamps, which made it stand out from its sea of competitors. Everything seemed to be looking up for this now-defunct Mexican chain. So where did it all take a turn?\n\nThe previously glorious Mexican chain was doing really well in the '90s, but by the early 2000s, things started to fall apart. It went through different owners before it completely shut down. Avado Brands, which bought Don Pablo's from DF&R Restaurants in 1995, eventually filed for bankruptcy in 2004. But it seemed that most of Don Pablo's locations remained open. In 2007, Avado Brands filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy once again, which prompted the management to sell its holdings at an auction. It was already losing a lot of its stores in the process, and eventually, Rita Restaurant Corporation bought Don Pablo's at the 2008 auction. You would think that after the repeated setbacks, Don Pablo's would finally turn things around. But it became evident how the restaurant chain continued to struggle financially. In 2016, Rita Restaurant Corporation also filed for bankruptcy, eventually leading a lot of restaurants to cease operations until the last one in Deptford, N.J. closed in 2019.\n\nRita Restaurant Group pointed to the competitive Mexican restaurant scene, as well as the challenges in casual dining operations. To make things worse, it was during this time when chains like Chipotle began pioneering the fast casual chain boom, causing further decline for Don Pablo's. Perhaps other than quality food and impressive interiors, the chain never discovered its niche enough to make it stand out. Now, Don Pablo's is but a fleeting memory, and we can only reminisce about the once-familiar name that brought many of us a lot of good times.\n\nWant more food knowledge?

    "description": "Antoine Wade said everyone has the same amount of time in a day to learn about AI tools, and in this moment, everyone is competing.",
    "fullText": "Antoine Wade, a tech sales employee, uses AI daily for personal and professional tasks.\n\nHe said AI has helped him grow his pipeline by letting him communicate more effectively and understand customers better.\n\nHe said he keeps some of his AI strategies private to maintain a competitive advantage in sales.\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Antoine Wade, a tech sales employee who is based in San Antonio. His identity and employment have been verified by Business Insider. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI started to use AI around 2022 when ChatGPT first launched. It was unlike any technology that I've come across and I started to leverage it in my personal and professional life.\n\nInitially, it helped me craft emails. I work in tech sales and I have to do a lot of cold outreaches. My job is to write messages that resonate with various leaders and ChatGPT helped me with that.\n\nOnce I started using it at work, I realized that as a sports coach and father, there was so much more I could use it for, like sending post-practice communication to parents, building schedules, or putting together statistics of how the game went. Tasks that used to take me days took me literal minutes.\n\nNow I use AI everyday, and I've experimented with different tools. I use Claude to help with business communication and content generation. I use Perplexity for deep research, and Gemini for image generation. I use these tools for a combination of personal, professional, and educational use-cases. I've learned how to install an air conditioner and how to teach my son 6th grade math.\n\nMy company has also given me access to tools that have been really powerful in sales. It can help with gaining a better understanding of the customer in a minute's notice.\n\nFor example, tools like Salesforce Sales Navigator can pinpoint almost the exact person that may be looking for the product I'm selling. Now when I reach out to that person, the conversation will be more fruitful than it would if it were a completely random cold call.\n\nAI hasn't helped me close deals — I'm the one that's built those relationships with customers — but I've seen an increase in my pipeline because I'm able to reach more clients with the data and messaging.\n\nWhen I'm able to understand the customer better, I'm able to communicate more effectively, which leads to building a better pipeline, which ultimately leads to making more money.\n\nWhile people may have access to the same tools, it's still up to the user to put the data together and craft the right prompts. I've been experimenting with so many automation tools that I've developed a secret sauce.\n\nIf I'm creating prompts that give me a better message, which leads to a better outcome, I may not share it with others because I want to see if it works and if it's going to give me a competitive advantage.\n\nWe all have the same amount of time in a day to learn these things. So if I'm putting more time toward learning more about prompt engineering or how AI is supposed to work, then I don't necessarily want to share those learnings with someone else. In this moment, we're all competing.\n\nI will absolutely help someone if they ask, but there are certain details I'm not as forthcoming about. I may share some of those learnings with some of my closest friends or people I feel I can learn from, but that doesn't mean I'm sharing it with everybody.\n\nSales is very competitive and while companies are choosing to have conversations around AI, some people may not be as comfortable sharing how they're leveraging it because that may be their competitive advantage.\n\nWhen people ask if I use AI, I say \"absolutely, yes.\" But there's only a certain amount of people that I'm going into a deeper conversations about AI with.",

    "title": "Wild-Caught Or Farm-Raised Fish: Does It Make A Difference Which One You Buy?",
    "description": "All the fish you find at your supermarket were either wild-caught or farm-raised, and there are differences in the final product. Here's what you should know.",
    "fullText": "If you're buying fish, the choices can be daunting — and not just because of the many different varieties available or the difficulties of figuring out how to choose the freshest fish. Another question to ask yourself is should you buy farm-raised or wild-caught? There are pros and cons to both, so how do you choose? To help make your decision, we've reviewed the many aspects you need to take into consideration when deciding between the two.\n\nFarm-raised fish, meaning fish that is raised in a controlled environment, are a product of a practice known as aquaculture. They can be a perfectly good choice, as long as you know what you are looking for when you shop. In fact, more than 50% of the world's seafood supply is farm-raised. Wild-caught fish are harvested from open bodies of water, such as seas, lakes, or rivers, where the fish live in their natural habitat and survive and reproduce without the assistance of humans. In some ways, it is difficult to replicate the quality of fish that live in the wild, but there are still plenty of reasons to favor fish raised in hatcheries. Aside from these broader differences, your choice between the two comes down to nutritional value, flavor, price, and sustainability.\n\nThe nutritional value of fish is not a secret. Fish is packed with vitamins and nutrients, but the environment a fish lives in has an impact on its nutritional value. Wild-caught fish have a more active lifestyle (with limitless room to roam) and enjoy a natural, healthy diet, which makes them highly nutritious. That means high-quality proteins containing essential amino acids that are easily absorbed by your body, and you don't have to worry about the fish containing antibiotics.\n\nFarm-raised fish eat a carefully controlled diet that is designed to boost the omega-3 fatty acids in the fish so that it is comparable with that of wild-caught fish. Farm-raised salmon, for instance, has the same amount of protein (22 grams) as wild-caught salmon, but actually has slightly higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids (2.1 grams compared to 2 grams). The downside, however, is that the fat content and calories of farm-raised salmon tend to be slightly higher than their wild counterparts, partly as a result of the limited exercise they get.\n\nWhile some differences between wild and farm-raised fish, such as nutritional value, might be negligible, one determining factor in your decision should be flavor. Wild-caught fish has a reputation for having stronger flavor and firmer texture as a result of its varied diet and highly active lifestyle.\n\nFarm-raised fish, on the other hand, receive carefully controlled diets that may guarantee their nutritional value, but lack the variety of what fish would eat in the wild. As a result, they tend to have a milder flavor that is often considered buttery as a result of the higher fat content these fish are known for. If you want to serve fish that has the same reliable flavor every time, however, farm-raised fish might be a better choice since the diets farmed fish are given don't vary much.\n\nSustainability is a deciding factor for a lot of fish lovers. With popular grocery chains stocking their shelves with sustainably sourced fish, it's getting easier and easier to buy seafood responsibly. When it comes to sustainable seafood, we're talking about seafood caught or produced in ways that promote the long-term well-being of the species, as well as reducing any harmful effects on the environment and promoting a sustainable lifestyle for those who work in the industry. However, there is still a debate about whether one type of fish is more sustainable than the other.\n\nHarvesting fish from the wild can be sustainable, depending on the practices used by the fishermen. Florida's delicious stone crabs are an excellent example of sustainably harvested fishing that doesn't utilize fish hatcheries. By following local regulations, including catch limits and only fishing for certain species at certain times, fisherman can ensure that a species isn't over-fished to extinction. The problem is proving these practices are being followed is difficult, especially for the consumer. Farming fish solves the problem of overfishing by design. Farming directly manages species populations and ensures a continual replenishment of supplies, letting natural supplies flourish on their own in the process.\n\nWhen it comes to sustainability, the protection of marine species isn't the only issue. There is also a significant impact on the environment to be considered. With wild fishing, there are not only the carbon emissions from commercial fishing vessels to be concerned about, but also the waste generated and the harm to the marine ecosystem and other marine life caused by fishing gear, such as torn or lost fishing nets or traps. In contrast, aquafarms require a lot of resources to build and operate, creating carbon emissions in the process. In recent years, however, there have been advancements in technologies that help create more efficient aquaculture practices that result in lower CO2 emissions.\n\nWhen it comes to sustainability and environmental impact, the key is to shop responsibly. There are some certifications that you can look for, but they are not universal or consistent, and difficult for authorities to regulate and monitor. A great way to do your due diligence is to ask your retailer, who can tell you if the fish was sustainably sourced and where it was sourced from. You can also check with sources such as NOAA Fish Watch, a government organization that helps monitor species known for being overfished and involved in environmental concerns related to their harvesting.\n\nWild-caught fish is often favored by consumers, but it also tends to come at a higher price. There is an obvious difference between the amount of work involved in the two practices, with wild fish supplies being unpredictable. Food supplies can impact the swimming patterns of fish, making them potentially difficult for fishermen to find, which can make the supply scarce. Weather is another uncontrollable factor that can prevent fishermen from catching the amount of fish they are searching for. This random availability affects the supply and demand process that drives retail prices.\n\nAquafarms, however, are not susceptible to these forces of nature and are better able to control production cost. They also control and replenish their own supply, therefore reducing the problem of supply shortages. In turn, aquafarms can offer consistent supplies at steady prices, which prevents the supply and demand issue from causing fluctuations in price.\n\nFarming fish and catching it in the wild both have their benefits, as well as their drawbacks, that affect both the ecosystem and the consumer. Ultimately, shopping responsibly and knowing what you are buying (and why) helps you make the decision that is best for you.\n\nWant more food knowledge?

    "description": "Nathan MacKinnon and Brock Nelson spearheaded Colorado’s offensive onslaught, combining for four points as the Avalanche extended their winning streak to eight games with a disciplined 5–2 victory over the Los Angeles Kings.",
    "fullText": "DENVER —  Nathan MacKinnon and Brock Nelson each recorded a goal and an assist as the Colorado Avalanche extended their winning streak to eight games with a 5–2 victory over the Los Angeles Kings at Ball Arena on Monday night.\n\nJack Drury, Martin Nečas, and Cale Makar also found the back of the net for Colorado (29-2-7), which has now won 14 straight games on home ice and is 10-0-1 over its last 11 contests. Mackenzie Blackwood stopped 23 shots in the win, making several timely, highlight-reel saves to help seal the victory.\n\nCorey Perry and Joel Armia scored for Los Angeles (16-13-9), while Anton Forsberg made 21 saves. The Kings have dropped seven of their last nine games and have lost five of their last six meetings with the Avalanche.\n\nBrent Burns turned the puck over at center ice early, allowing Alex Turcotte to break in alone, but Blackwood stood tall and turned aside the chance.\n\nJust over nine minutes into the period, Colorado had managed only one shot on goal, though its defense was doing its part. Josh Manson set a physical tone by knocking Quinton Byfield off the puck during one sequence.\n\nAt the 9:24 mark, the Avalanche doubled their shot total in emphatic fashion. Drury fired a shot that deflected off Darcy Kuemper’s blocker and into the net to give Colorado a 1–0 lead. The play developed after Ross Colton intercepted a pass, surveyed the ice, and found Drury streaking down the middle for the finish.\n\nWith nearly four minutes remaining, Colorado went to the power play after Andrei Kuzmenko was whistled for interference following a collision with Gavin Brindley off the draw. The man advantage came up empty, and the teams returned to even strength.\n\nAfter one period, the Avalanche held a 1–0 lead despite Los Angeles owning a 10–8 edge in shots.\n\nParker Kelly was penalized for holding early in the frame, and with just four seconds left on the kill, Colorado surrendered the equalizer when Perry deflected a pass from Kevin Fiala past Blackwood to tie the game.\n\nA few minutes later, Brian Dumoulin was sent off for interference on Drury. Dumoulin vehemently disagreed with the call and argued with the officials before heading to the box. After Colorado failed to convert on its second power play, Colton was assessed an interference penalty.\n\nNečas restored the lead with 6:39 remaining on a scramble in front. Gabe Landeskog and MacKinnon each took swings at a loose puck, and after Forsberg failed to smother it, the rebound trickled free to Nečas at the doorstep for an easy tap-in.\n\nLos Angeles was penalized again when Brandt Clarke cross-checked Artturi Lehkonen in the back. The power play struggled once more, and Kempe nearly made Colorado pay with a shorthanded breakaway, but Blackwood came up with a massive save.\n\nNelson made it 3–1 with 2:30 left in the period, ripping a wrist shot over Forsberg’s glove after taking a perfectly placed saucer feed from Kiviranta.\n\nNearly four minutes into the final frame, Clarke was sent to the box again—this time for tripping Kiviranta and sending him crashing into the boards.\n\nThe Kings, however, refused to fold. Armia struck shorthanded to pull Los Angeles within a goal, skating the length of the ice before toe-dragging around Cale Makar to give himself additional real estate and time before snapping a wrist shot from the high slot that slipped through Blackwood five-hole.\n\nAs the clock approached the midway point of the period, Drury was whistled for hooking on what appeared to be a questionable call, but the penalty kill stood firm and snuffed out the threat.\n\nMacKinnon only had two shots on net, and the final one was a goal as he shot the puck into an empty net at 18:23 to make it 4-2, and Makar scored on a rebound with 45 seconds left to complete the 5-2 victory.\n\nAs the Avalanche have shown all season, they have exhibited grit and the ability to suffocate their opposition in the championship rounds.\n\nThe Avalanche will square off against the struggling St. Louis Blues on New Year’s Eve to close out 2025. Coverage begins at 7 p.m., with a fireworks show scheduled to follow the game.\n\nFor action-packed issues, access to the entire magazine archive and a free issue, com/free.

    "fullText": "ATLANTA (AP) — Matthew Stafford reached a career milestone, though his three interceptions hurt the Rams' chances of winning a game and perhaps his own of winning the NFL's MVP.\n\nStafford set a career high in touchdown passes in a season with 42 when he hit Puka Nakua for an 11-yard score with 2:46 to play, but the Falcons answered with a 51-yard field goal with 21 seconds left and upset the Rams 27-24 on Monday night.\n\nStafford was 22 for 38 for 269 yards with two touchdowns and a season-high three interceptions, one of which was returned for a touchdown. It was the quarterback's first three-interception game since Week 1 of the 2022 season.\n\n“He’s a total stud,” Rams coach Sean McVay said. “We wouldn’t be in a lot of the great situations we’re in without him. But tonight was, it was a night that he’s capable of playing better.”\n\nStafford helped rally the Rams from a 24-3 second-half deficit to tie the score at 24 on his scoring toss to Nakua. His first touchdown was a 27-yard pass to Terrence Ferguson in the third quarter that pulled the Rams within 24-10.\n\nStafford was also sacked three times, which matched a season high, but didn't feel like the Falcons' pressure was overwhelming.\n\n“Every week is a new challenge,\" Stafford said. \"Just because you play good one week doesn’t mean you’re going to play good the next, and vice versa. So just got to go out there and continue to trust what we’ve done all year, and then we got to just show up and make the plays on game day.”\n\nStafford’s previous high for touchdowns in a season was 41, which he accomplished twice. He had 41 in 2011 with the Lions and in 2021 with the Rams.\n\nStafford was the betting favorite to win the first MVP award of his 17-year career ahead of Patriots second-year quarterback Drake Maye. On Sunday, Maye had a near-perfect afternoon against the Jets, presumably closing the gap on Stafford. Maye was 19 for 21 for 256 yards and five touchdowns in New York as the Patriots rolled to a 42-10 win. He played the first six possessions of the game and led the Patriots to six touchdowns.\n\nStafford is averaging 278 passing yards per game to Maye's 262.7, has 42 passing TDs to Maye's 30 and the quarterbacks are even with eight interceptions apiece. Maye's big day against the Jets pulled him virtually even with Stafford in passer rating prior to the Falcons game. Maye also has 409 rushing yards and four rushing touchdowns while Stafford has -2 rushing yards and no rushing touchdowns on the season. Maye's completion percentage, which leads the NFL, is 71.7 to Stafford's 65.2 (18th).\n\nThe Patriots clinched the AFC East on Sunday and enter Week 18 with a 13-3 record, while Stafford's Rams are 11-5 and will enter the playoffs as a wild card. The Patriots will close the regular season at home against the Dolphins and still have a shot at the No. 1 seed in the AFC, so Maye figures to play. Los Angeles will host the Arizona Cardinals and McVay said Monday his starters will play.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Kings (16-13-9) delivered a competitive, physical performance against the NHL's elite team. Still, costly turnovers and late-game execution issues proved decisive in their 5-2 loss to the Colorado Avalanche (29-2-7) on Monday night.\n\nDespite the Kings keeping pace for much of the game and generating consistent man-to-man pressure that was giving the Avs trouble early on, LA was unable to match Colorado's finishing touches, especially in the final minutes of regulation.\n\nFinal from Denver. #GoKingsGo pic.twitter.com/A29PaP048W\n\n— LA Kings (@LAKings) December 30, 2025\n\nThe first period played like a playoff atmosphere in the Mile High City, with both teams finishing checks and pushing the pace from the opening whistle. The Kings showed up early with their physicality, throwing hits from Adrian Kempe, Warren Foegele, and Alex Laferriere while generating quality looks.\n\nHowever, Colorado struck first. Center Ross Colton forced a turnover on the forecheck and fed Jack Drury in the slot, who beat goaltender Anton Forsberg for a 1-0 Avalanche lead.\n\nLos Angeles continued to put pressure on the Avs, but Mackenzie Blackwood was sharp under the net, turning aside multiple Kings chances to break Colorado's lead.\n\nThe Kings tied the game midway through the second period thanks to Corey Perry's veteran play this season. Perry found soft ice near the crease and finished off a Kevin Fiala feed, beating Blackwood to knot the game at 1-1.\n\nDespite the Kings' goal, the Avs never let them stay comfortable, and the momentum didn't last long.\n\nColorado responded with relentless pressure. Forward Martin Necas restored the Avs' lead after a dominant shift that should've been a penalty on the Kings, but Necas still sustained the puck to score in traffic around the net.\n\nLater in the period, center Brock Nelson made it 3-1 after another Kings turnover, giving Colorado breathing room heading into the third.\n\nLos Angeles made one final push in the third. Armia delivered a highlight of the night with a dazzling shorthanded goal, now leading the NHL with four shorthanded goals. But Colorado closed the door on the Kings' inability to convert when they had so many chances to tie the game.\n\nThe Avalanche scored two goals in the final minute of regulation, with an empty-netter coming seconds later to seal the victory 5-2.\n\nThe Kings finished shots to Colorado's 26 and won 50 percent of its faceoffs, but 18 giveaways, several of them led to the Avs directly scoring and giving them several chances, which proved to be costly for Los Angeles.\n\nWhile Los Angeles proved today that it can skate and compete physically with Colorado, the Avalanche still exposed the Kings' mistakes that have been punishing them all season.\n\nFor action-packed issues, access to the entire magazine archive and a free issue, com/free.

    "fullText": "Mike Brown believes the New York Knicks have 'The Guy' to compete for a championship originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New York Knicks are considered by the majority of the NBA as the favorite to win the Eastern Conference. Before the season even started, the expectations were high for the Knicks, considering the Indiana Pacers lost their superstar guard, Tyrese Haliburton.\n\nNow, the Knicks are not the number one seed, but they have the strongest chance of succeeding in the postseason. They also have a superstar who can carry them to victory in Jalen Brunson. With that kind of star power, it is hard to count out the Knicks in any game they play.\n\nDuring the Knicks' game against the New Orleans Pelicans, Jalen Brunson once again showcased his star power with 28 points and 10 assists. It was yet another superb performance by the Knicks, which is their third win in a row.\n\nWith that victory, they are only one game behind the Detroit Pistons, who are at the top of the Eastern Conference. The Pistons have lost two games in a row, which could mean the Knicks can keep fighting for the number one seed in the East.\n\nMore: Josh Hart's message fueled Knicks' historic Christmas comeback\n\nKnicks head coach Mike Brown always loves to hype up his players, including Brunson.

    "fullText": "Something has to might come to an end on Tuesday (2:30 pm ET) — Chelsea's run of just one win in six Premier League games, or Bournemouth's nine-game winless slide — when the two sides meet at Stamford Bridge to close out 2025.\n\nJust as they did last season, Chelsea (5th place - 29 points) entered into the PL title race for all of a handful of days before falling into a downward spiral that ended their chase just as quickly as it began. The Blues sat 2nd in the table after 12 games, six points off leaders Arsenal. Six games (and just one win) later, and the gap is 13. Saturday’s 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa was a heavy blow for Enzo Maresca's side, after they flat out dominated the game in the first half (10-0 shots, 1.97-0.00 xG) before a shocking role reversal after the break.\n\nIf confidence is low for the hosts, where must it be for Andoni Iraola's side? Speaking of sides that went 2nd in the table before the wheels fell off, Bournemouth (15th - 22 points) were four points back of Arsenal after nine games but after taking just four points from the next nine, they are now 20 points adrift and seem set to lose star attacker Antoine Semenyo during the January transfer window. Semenyo has a release clause in his contract that expires early in the month and Manchester City are keen to wrap up the deal quickly.\n\nFor live updates and highlights throughout Chelsea vs Bournemouth, check out PST's live blog coverage below.\n\nKick off time: 2:30 pm ET, Tuesday\nVenue: Stamford Bridge\nTV Channel: USA\nStreaming: Stream live on NBC.com\n\nOUT: Romeo Lavia (thigh), Dario Essugo (thigh), Levi Colwill (torn ACL - MORE), Mykhailo Mudryk (suspension) | QUESTIONABLE: Marc Cucurella (thigh), Jorrel Hato (undisclosed)\n\nOUT: Tyler Adams (knee - MORE), Veljko Milosavljevic (knee), Ben Gannon-Doak (hamstring), Matai Akinmboni (muscular) | QUESTIONABLE: Antoine Semenyo (undisclosed), Alex Scott (jaw)\n\nExactly what Chelsea need — a comfortable win thanks to their considerable attacking talent.

    "fullText": "It is actually BlueCo who are eyeing a former Manchester City midfielder rather than Chelsea, at least not yet anyway.\n\nStrasbourg is a known route to Chelsea for many players, being their sister club and under the same ownership group.\n\nSo when a player is linked to Strasbourg, you can often know that he is a potential future candidate to become a Chelsea player as well.\n\nAnd it looks like Chelsea’s recent links to James McAtee, would be more a signing for Strasbourg for now at least. I’d suspect Chelsea would view the former Manchester City man as a potential player for them in the near future, should he go and prove himself at their sister club.\n\nJames McAtee playing for Nottingham Forest. (Photo by Michael Regan/Getty Images)\n\nThe BBC report that BlueCo’s interest in Nottingham Forest midfielder James McAtee is for a loan move to Strasbourg rather than joining Chelsea.\n\nThis would make a bit more sense for now of course. But we know that McAtee is liked by Joe Shields and worked with him at City, and Shields is a Chelsea director. So I’d assume this is still being looked at as a possible future Chelsea move down the line at some point.\n\nReece James spoke to the club’s website after the game about how he and his teammates had failed to adapt to the changes made by Aston Villa midway through the game.\n\nJames also noted how well his team had done for large periods of the game – sadly games are not 65 minutes, and if you don’t score the goals your performance warrants you’ll always get punished.",

The Sun describes it as a \"horror crash\".\n\nThe Financial Times says the world's largest accounting body has decided to scrap remote exams because of a rise in students cheating when sitting tests online.\n\nThe Association of Chartered Certified Accountants says remote exams, which it introduced during the pandemic, have become too hard to police, partly because of cheating using AI.\n\nThere is plenty of reaction to the New Year Honours list in the papers, with the actor Idris Elba's knighthood making most of the headlines.\n\n\"Arise Sir Idris\", says the Daily Telegraph, the Daily Mirror and the Sun.\n\nMeanwhile, the front page of the i declares that England's Lionesses have \"dominated\" the honours after their Euros win in the summer.

    "fullText": "More than a year after his last Major League game, former Boston Red Sox pitcher Joe Kelly is calling it a career.\n\nKelly essentially announced his retirement on the “Baseball Isn’t Boring” podcast, saying he’s no longer pitching. True to form, he refused to explicitly say he’s retiring, taking exception to the phrase.\n\n“Retiring is, like, something my grandmother did,” Kelly said. “It’s so disrespectful. I’m sorry all you people out there that work a real job. You guys deserve to retire. Athletes don’t. We just stop (expletive) playing…No more retirement (expletive).”\n\nKelly last pitched in 2024 for the Los Angeles Dodgers, earning his third World Series ring. After going unsigned in 2025, the 37-year-old right-hander is hanging it up.\n\nHis eventful MLB career spanned 13 seasons from 2012 to 2024. He pitched for four teams and won three championships along the way, primarily as a reliever.\n\nAfter beginning his career with the St. Louis Cardinals, Kelly spent four and a half seasons with the Red Sox from 2014 to 2018. He initially struggled as a starter but had more success after moving to the bullpen, leading the 2018 World Series champs with 73 relief appearances.\n\nKelly flourished during that playoff run, allowing just one earned run with 13 strikeouts over 11 1/3 postseason innings. He always saved his best for October, posting a 0.51 ERA in the playoffs with Boston.\n\nHe joined the Dodgers after pitching against them in the 2018 Fall Classic, helping them win titles in 2020 and 2024.\n\nTalkative, combative and armed with a good fastball, Kelly had a reputation for getting under opponents’ skin and occasionally starting brawls. He was a character who stood out from the crowd with his unique personality and presence, making him one of the more memorable relievers in recent Red Sox history.\n\nRed Sox Should Sign Veteran Southpaw After Short Stint With Cubs",

    "fullText": "The Calgary Flames leaned on patience, goaltending, and timely execution to earn a 2–1 overtime win against the Boston Bruins on Monday night at the Scotiabank Saddledome.\n\nThe opening period lacked pace until Boston earned a power play midway through the frame. Flames goaltender Dustin Wolf was sharp early, making a pair of key saves to keep the game scoreless. Late in the period, Bruins defenceman Andrew Peeke drove toward the net and made contact with Wolf after losing the puck, as it slipped through Wolf and into the net. Calgary challenged for goaltender interference, but the goal stood, giving Boston a 1–0 lead at the 18:06 mark and putting the Flames shorthanded to close the period.\n\nThe second period remained tight-checking and low-event until Calgary finally broke through. At 13:33, sustained pressure in the offensive zone paid off as Mikael Backlund found Blake Coleman in the slot. Coleman snapped a quick shot through Bruins netminder Jeremy Swayman to tie the game 1–1, marking his team-leading 12th goal of the season.\n\nThe third period stayed scoreless despite Boston holding an 8–1 edge in shots. As regulation expired, Bruins defenceman Jonathan Aspirot was assessed a high-sticking penalty, sending the Flames to overtime with a carryover power play.\n\nCalgary nearly saw the advantage backfire when Pavel Zacha sprung loose for a shorthanded breakaway early in overtime. Wolf came up with a clutch stop and turned aside the rebound attempt from Nikita Zadorov. Moments later, the Flames capitalized. Yegor Sharangovich fired a shot through traffic, and Connor Zary got a piece of the rebound in front, as the puck found its way past Swayman to secure the 2–1 overtime victory.\n\n1. Blake Coleman continues to set the tone\n\nColeman delivered exactly what the Flames needed — offence, physical play, and composure in big moments. His second-period goal provided the spark, he finished checks throughout the night, and he drew the penalty that set up the overtime winner. His consistency has made him one of Calgary’s most reliable drivers this season.\n\n2. Dustin Wolf was calm and composed\n\nWolf turned aside 24 shots, including two high-danger chances in overtime, earning his 50th win of the season. He remained poised under pressure, tracked pucks well through traffic, and made the saves Calgary needed when momentum tilted Boston’s way.\n\n3. The power play found a way when it mattered most\n\nCalgary went 0-for-4 with the man advantage in regulation, struggling to generate rhythm. But the unit stayed patient, and the carryover power play in overtime finally delivered, proving decisive in a tightly contested game.\n\n“They play a pretty similar game to us and you’ve got to earn your ice and your space. Felt like one of those games that one goal was going to be the difference late in the game and, not pretty, but we got the job done.”\n\nWolf on the overtime breakaway saves:\n\n“Saw the first one, got snowed on the second one, so thankfully (the puck) hit me.”\n\n“At the end of day I think we just know (Wolf’s) got our back and he’s going to make big saves all the time and keep us in games… whether they’re on a 2-on-1 or have a breakaway you have confidence that Wolf is just going to make the save.”",

He is a career .241 hitter during four major league seasons with four teams, but excels as a baserunner and a defender.\n\nThe Dodgers acquired Ruiz from the A’s last April, and he was a little-used reserve when he was in the majors for the back-to-back World Series champions. Ruiz batted .190 in 19 games for Los Angeles, largely playing as a defensive replacement or a pinch runner.\n\nThe Marlins designated infielder Eric Wagaman for assignment to make room on their 40-man roster for Ruiz. The trade opened a spot on the Dodgers’ 40-man roster.\n\nAs a capable backup outfielder, Ruiz could be the Marlins’ replacement for Dane Myers, who was traded to Cincinnati last weekend.",

    "fullText": "When it was announced that RC Strasbourg Alsace would be losing their star forward from last season, Emanuel Emegha, to Chelsea at the end of the 2025/26 season, few would have predicted that by winter, he would have lost his spot to Joaquin Panichelli, a 23-year-old Argentinian who had spent the previous season playing in the Spanish second tier.\n\nJoaquin came through the youth academy at Argentina’s Racing Club, in his hometown of Córdoba. By 2020, he was on the books at the academy of River Plate, Argentina’s most successful team, boasting over 50 domestic titles and 18 international accolades in their illustrious history. He never actually made his debut for the senior team, before attracting attention from Europe.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of many of Argentina’s greatest forwards, he made the step to Spain; Deportivo Alaves acquired his services in January 2023 for a reported fee in the region of €3m, a not-insignificant fee for an unproven 19-year-old with no senior experience for a Spanish side fighting for promotion from La Liga 2. He made two appearances in the second half of the European season, as Alaves gained promotion back to La Liga. In his first full season with Alaves, he struggled to for game time and did not light up the show on the few chances he was given. Panichelli went goalless in eight appearances (six off the bench) which led Alaves to consider their options for the young South American.\n\nThe decision was taken to send the striker out on loan to CD Mirandes, who are known for their youth development, especially developing young players who come in on loan. This is where Panichelli finally got his first taste of regular football at senior level, and he really took his opportunity in showing the world his talent. Mirandes cruelly missed out on promotion to La Liga in the playoff final, after Panichelli had scored 20 goals and assisted four times to get them there.\n\nHis performances for Mirandes naturally attracted attention from many top clubs in Spain and beyond, and with Alaves looking to cash in, it was Strasbourg, fresh off the back of qualifying for the UEFA Europa Conference League group stage who secured his signature for a fee in the region of €17m.\n\nStrasbourg were Ligue 1’s biggest spenders this summer with a whopping €111.5m spent bring in a number of players, of which Panichelli was the most expensive. The 22-year-old Argentinian certainly had stiff competition for a starting place, going up against club captain ‘Ema’ Emegha who had propelled the Alsatian club into the Europa Conference League with 14 goals and three assists in the league the season prior.\n\nSince joining, though, Panichelli has improved even further. So far, he has racked up nine goals in his 16 games played and is second in the Ligue 1 golden boot race only to Marseille’s Mason Greenwood. The Strasbourg No.9 really asserted his position as the future of Liam Rosenior’s attack in a 5-0 home win against SCO Angers in October, when, but for an impressive display of shot-stopping from Angers’ goalkeeper Hervé Koffi, Joaquin could have had four or five goals by himself. He did net two goals in that game, as the injured Emegha watched on from the stands, just a month after announcing that he would be leaving to join BlueCo’s other club, Chelsea, for a fee of €25m next summer.\n\nWith Emegha’s recurring hamstring injury this season, Panichelli has had to step up to be Strasbourg’s starting striker through the middle, when he was probably only brought in over the summer to be a deputy, to come off the bench late on to offer something different to the six-foot-six Dutchman. Nevertheless, Panichelli has since given Rosenior a bit of a headache after performing so well this first half of the season.\n\nOn the pitch, Panichelli blends traditional “big man” No.9 traits with a modern twist; he is strong in the air and an effective target man who holds the ball up well under pressure but also has the quickness of feet and movement that one might associate more with a winger or inside forward. He can score with both his head and feet and shows great pressing qualities that we have come to expect from a Rosenior team since the Englishman joined the BlueCo project back in July 2024. Panichelli ranks in the top 3% of forwards in Europe’s top five leagues for interceptions and blocks per 90, and in the top 10% for tackles and clearances. The six-foot-four Argentine is a clinical finisher, combining extremely well with Strasbourg’s Ivorian right back Guela Doué, who has provided him with three assists already this season.\n\nThere remain areas for the young man to improve; despite his speed, he rarely uses his speed to dribble past defenders, ranking in the bottom 10% of strikers in Europe’s big five leagues for progressive carries and passes. He would not be described by many as a creator, but no one can deny that he is an excellent finisher, and with time could become world-class – the next in a long line of Argentinian attacking superstars.\n\nPanichelli’s contract at Strasbourg runs until 2030. For this reason, any club that may come calling in the next few years could be looking at paying a sizeable fee for his services, should his good form since arriving continue. For now, he needs to focus on maintaining his position in the national team setup, after making his debut off the bench in a friendly against Angola in the most recent international break. If called up, he should be one to watch during the upcoming World Cup in the USA, Canada and Mexico.\n\nHe could yet be the future of Argentina’s attack, and at least in the medium to short-term, he looks to be the future of RCSA’s strike force, too.",

    "title": "7 takeaways from Rams' frustrating loss to Falcons",
    "description": "The Rams played terribly against the Falcons and no longer look like the unbeatable NFC leaders they once were.",
    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Rams bounced back from their previous three losses by winning their next game. They failed to do that on Monday night, losing in fairly embarrassing fashion to the Atlanta Falcons, 27-24.\n\nThey allowed their loss to the Seattle Seahawks to snowball into a losing skid, having now dropped two in a row. Sean McVay is frustrated, Matthew Stafford had one of his worst games of the season and the defense just gave up 195 yards rushing to Bijan Robinson.\n\nThere aren't many positives to take away from this game and though the sky isn't falling, the Rams have plenty to correct before the playoffs begin.\n\nD.J. Humphries was a liability at left tackle all night long. He whiffed on a block on the Rams’ failed fourth-down run early in the game, got called for an illegal formation on Puka Nacua’s 36-yard catch, allowed a sack in the third quarter and was getting beat throughout the game.\n\nHis costliest play might’ve been in the fourth quarter when his holding penalty negated a game-tying 41-yard touchdown catch by Puka Nacua, though Nacua did get into the end zone a few plays later.\n\nJackson was questionable and Sean McVay thought he might be able to play so it doesn’t seem like a long-term injury, but the Rams need him healthy in the worst way. They can't go into the playoffs with Humphries at left tackle.\n\nHis coverage skills are obviously great, but Lake is especially missed as a run defender. He’s disciplined and takes good angles to ball carriers, which helps prevent big plays when running backs to get to the second and third level of the defense.\n\nBijan Robinson gashed the Rams for 195 yards on the ground Monday night and that’s not to say Lake would’ve completely changed the outcome, but his presence as the slot defender surely would’ve helped limit some of Robinson’s bigger runs.\n\nIt’s not that the secondary gave up huge plays to Kirk Cousins and the Falcons’ passing attack. The Rams only allowed 126 yards passing, 34 of which were with Robinson on the receiving end.\n\nIt’s that the coverage was never all that tight and the secondary couldn’t cover when the defense needed to get off the field. They didn’t force many difficult throws for Cousins, aside from the one pass Emmanuel Forbes Jr. broke up on the opening drive.\n\nThat was the Rams’ only pass defensed in the entire game.\n\nIt’s not a good sign that they keep rotating cornerbacks without finding their best trio, making Ahkello Witherspoon inactive the last two weeks and Darious Williams on Monday night. Come playoff time, the Rams need their corners to play better.\n\nThere’s a big difference between the Rams’ last two losses. Against the Seahawks, they simply melted down and collapsed in the fourth quarter. Against the Falcons, they simply did not play well. They mustered just 363 total yards on offense, went 5-for-13 on third down and turned it over three times.\n\nThere was a lot to like in the loss to Seattle, but it’s hard to find many positives from this game. As McVay said afterwards, the Rams “have to play better.” And that’s exactly why he plans to play his starters in the finale against the Cardinals.\n\nIf the Rams don’t clean things up on both sides of the ball, they’re not going very far in the playoffs. Getting Davante Adams, Kevin Dotson, Quentin Lake and Alaric Jackson back at some point will help but this isn’t how L.A. wanted to finish off what had been a great year up until the last two weeks.\n\nStafford’s disastrous first half set things in motion for Drake Maye to take over as the MVP frontrunner. Then Stafford threw another interception in the fourth quarter when the Rams were trying to tie the game.\n\nMVP is partly a team award so when you lose as a quarterback, it hurts your chances of winning votes. And not only did the Rams lose, but Stafford played terribly. It was arguably his worst game of the year, throwing three interceptions and missing a few open throws – including one that would’ve gotten the Rams in field goal range in the final seconds or possibly gone for a touchdown.\n\nMaye is now -550 to win NFL MVP as the heavy favorite and is unlikely to give it up in the final week against the Dolphins.\n\nFerguson only had two catches but both of them were big plays. His first was a 27-yard reception on a stutter-and-go down the left side, picking up chunks of yards when the Rams badly needed them. He then scored a 27-yard touchdown in the third quarter to make it 24-10, drawing the Rams a bit closer.\n\nHe only saw four targets on the night but his two receptions were both massive plays in the game to keep the momentum going. He’s going to be a special player for the Rams in 2026 after a full offseason of work, but his impact is already being felt as one of the team’s primary tight ends this year.\n\nIt only took one game for the Rams’ special teams unit to make a game-changing play after the firing of Chase Blackburn. For a unit that’s been a thorn in the Rams’ side all year, the special teams is actually what helped keep them in that game.\n\nJared Verse’s blocked field goal and return for a touchdown flipped the script, taking it from a possible 17-point game to only a seven-point deficit for the Rams. Ethan Evans hit a perfect punt that was downed at the 2 and Jordan Whittington had a nice 38-yard kickoff return.\n\nRoger McCreary did get called for a penalty on the Rams’ first punt return but for the most part, the special teams improved already.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Rams Wire: Rams vs. Falcons: 7 takeaways from LA's frustrating loss",

    "description": "“I hope that having sampled Premier League football for the first time, he’s hungry for more and determined to push on”.",
    "fullText": "As the years have passed and Sunderland’s squad has been revamped, refitted and reshaped, many of the architects of those memorable seasons and moments that preceded our return to the Premier League; of League One playoff success, the freewheeling “play it your way, lads” Tony Mowbray era and to an extent our landmark 2024/2025 season under Régis Le Bris have gradually moved on.\n\nFrom Corry Evans and Danny Batth to Ross Stewart and Bailey Wright; from Elliot Embleton and Patrick Roberts to Alex Pritchard and Jack Clarke, many if not all of the lads who played key roles under the likes of Alex Neil, Mowbray and Le Bris have left for pastures new.\n\nOf course, their legacies at Sunderland were secured in their own time but whether as a result of financial necessity, squad development or career progression, most of the players who created unforgettable moments at Hillsborough, the Hawthorns, the Madjeski Stadium and Wembley are long gone.\n\nHowever, one of them is still here and still proudly wearing the red and white stripes, and on Sunday, Dennis Cirkin finally earned the right to call himself a Premier League starter as he slotted in at left back for Sunderland’s clash with Leeds United.\n\nLike Luke O’Nien before him and after a Sunderland career that’s already encompassed League One playoff success and several promising campaigns in the Championship (including that goal against West Bromwich Albion), this felt like a landmark moment for the former Tottenham prospect — it was most definitely an opportunity earned and not given as a token gesture.\n\nFor me, as well as you’d expect for a player who’s battled back from long-term injury, has seen limited game time as a result and was therefore somewhat out of sync with Sunderland’s go-to system, the demands it places on our full backs and the frantic nature of Premier League football. In other words, he was fine.\n\nAgainst the visitors — who were good value for a point and showed the kind of purpose and determination that the likes of Newcastle United lacked — Cirkin showed flashes of energy and attacking intent but was also understandably rusty and was caught cold during the build up to Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s equaliser. That said, it certainly wasn’t a poor performance by any reasonable standard and I suspect he might’ve felt a quiet sense of satisfaction at how things went.\n\nWas this a surprise? Were we expecting miracles on his first top flight start? I think not, and it was to his credit that as a frenetic and occasionally scrappy game unfolded, Cirkin — much like Chris Rigg — didn’t shirk and didn’t hide.\n\nOnly the cynical, the bitter or the downright hard-hearted would begrudge Cirkin this opportunity.\n\nYes, his inclusion in Sunderland’s starting eleven against Daniel Farke’s men was borne of necessity, with first choice Reinildo and Arthur Masuaku both currently on AFCON duty, but at the same time, why would the club invest so much time and energy into Cirkin’s development if they didn’t believe he was capable of eventually making the step up?\n\nThe brilliant Mozambican is our first choice by some distance, but as the Christmas schedule takes its toll and players are brought in from the fringes, the onus is on the likes of Cirkin to show that they can play a role and offer Le Bris the kind of depth that he needs. With increased game time should come greater confidence and if he can get up to speed with the demands of top flight football, I can see him doing a sterling job until Reinildo returns from Morocco and is ready to go again.\n\nI’m unashamedly banging this particular drum for one simple reason: I like Cirkin as a footballer and I always have — not least because at his best in the Championship, he was one of the most dynamic and potent attack-minded full backs on the scene.\n\nFrom afar, he strikes me as something of a complex character; a player who perhaps has something of a difficult and fractious relationship with football, and it’s fair to say that he’s often endured torrid misfortune with injuries during his time at Sunderland.\n\nHowever, his ability is clear to see. He’s as deserving of a crack at top flight football as anyone and the fact that as of right now, he hasn’t put pen to paper on a new contract at Sunderland shouldn’t diminish his standing in the eyes of our fans.\n\nAs he seeks to prove that he can cut it at this level, what Le Bris and his coaching staff will almost certainly want to see from the likes of Cirkin is the kind of team-first attitude that’s propelled Sunderland along all season — and this was by no means a bad place to start.\n\nHe can play better and hopefully he will, and I hope that having sampled Premier League football for the first time, he’s hungry for more and determined to push on — starting against Manchester City later this week.",

    "fullText": "Girona head coach Michel has added fuel to growing speculation linking his side with a surprise winter move for Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen.\n\nReports in Spain have suggested that the Montilivi club are exploring the possibility of signing the German international on loan in January.\n\nGirona are reportedly keen to strengthen a position that has caused concern throughout the season.\n\nWhile no formal approach has been confirmed, Michel did little to quieten the rumours when asked about the situation at the Catalan Football Federation gala.\n\n“He is a top player. Everyone would like to have a player like that,” Michel said (via Gerard Romero), a remark that has only intensified talk of Girona’s interest.\n\nTer Stegen’s future at Barcelona has become increasingly uncertain after losing his place in the starting XI to Joan Garcia.\n\nThe 32-year-old remains one of Europe’s most decorated goalkeepers, but a lack of regular football could prove damaging to his hopes of reclaiming the No.1 shirt for Germany ahead of the 2026 World Cup.\n\nGirona’s interest is understood to be driven by their own goalkeeping issues.\n\nPaulo Gazzaniga has struggled for consistency, while Dominik Livakovic has yet to fully convince Michel or establish himself as a guaranteed starter.\n\nAs a result, the club are actively assessing options that could provide immediate stability and leadership at the back.\n\nHowever, financial constraints remain a major obstacle. Girona reportedly cannot cover Ter Stegen’s full wages for the remainder of the campaign.\n\nAny deal would require Barcelona to subsidise a significant portion of his salary.\n\nStill, Barca could be open to a compromise if Ter Stegen expresses a clear desire to move in search of more playing time.\n\nHe reportedly favours a switch that would restore him as an undisputed first choice, making Girona an attractive destination.\n\nWith the January window approaching, this story appears far from over.",

    "title": "On This Day (30th Dec 1893) Sunderland Get A Rare Run Out On This Date!",
    "description": "The last game of 1893 was far from easy, yet the Lads were able to prevail…",
    "fullText": "The vagaries of the Christmas footballing calendar mean that 30 December seldom sees Sunderland matches hosted — and it must be said that victories for the Lads on this date are even rarer. However, the first instance in 1893 was worthwhile, as Tom Watson’s side welcomed Bolton Wanderers to their Newcastle Road ground and finished the year off with a resilient showing.\n\nAlthough the visitors were in the bottom half of the table and not in the best of form, they made better use of the blustery conditions and performed well, meaning that strong performances from Donald Gow and Hugh Wilson in the home rearguard were well timed.\n\nWilson’s selection in particular proved crucial as having recently come back into the side for Will Gibson, it meant the latter was able to step in and run the line — Bolton secretary John Bentley doing likewise on the opposite side of the pitch in order to assist the referee.\n\nWhen Sunderland took the lead after twenty minutes, it was slightly against the run of play although the finish was tidy, with John Harvey finding the target after Johnny Campbell played the ball to him when being closed down. There was a chance of a second shortly afterwards too, although after Jimmy Hannah had hit the crossbar, Bolton were able to muster another spell of pressure.\n\nIf anything, the Hannah incident had worked out well for the Trotters; goalkeeper John Sutcliffe damaged the goal frame whilst attempting to save the effort and in the ten minutes it took to get that sorted, his teammates had a conflab and regathered themselves.\n\nIt was decided also that in order to make up for lost time, the teams wouldn’t leave the field at half time and instead swapped ends before immediately resuming play — meaning there was little respite for Sunderland as they sought to maintain the advantage.\n\nJust as it was starting to look like a single goal would be enough for a Wearsiders’ win, George Ferguson levelled things up.\n\nThere was an element of shock about the equaliser for the shot — which some sources instead credited to Davie Weir. It initially appeared to be quite tame yet still managed to creep over the line and put the Lads back to square one. It was now their turn to try and regroup therefore but they did so magnificently, with James Gillespie capping off an exciting final few minutes when he chested the ball into the net from one of Wilson’s classic long throw-ins.\n\nAt the time Watson’s men were reigning league champions, having taken the title for the second season running. Their defence had stuttered somewhat up to now though, and it was only in the new year that they put together any sort of consistency — the points taken from this clash leaving them in mid-table at what was the beginnings of a much-improved league run of eleven victories in thirteen.\n\nNevertheless, it wasn’t enough to overhaul leaders Aston Villa and by the time of the final fixture — a return clash with the since beaten FA Cup finalists Bolton — the club had been forced to settle for a runners-up spot.\n\nSunderland 2 (Harvey 20’, Gillespie 89’)\n\nBolton Wanderers 1 (Ferguson 80’)\n\nSunderland: Doig, Meehan, Gow; Dunlop, Auld, Wilson; Gillespie, Harvey, Campbell; Millar, Hannah",

    "description": "Given we've only just played against Manchester City and are very aware of the threat they pose, how do you think we should set up against them to ensure we keep our unbeaten home run going at the Stadium of Light?",
    "fullText": "We saw in the first 20 minutes of the away fixture that we were able to frustrate Man City. It was only down to Dias’ thunderbastard of a strike that the direction of the game changed.\n\nAlthough we are at home, we are under no illusions as to how challenging this game will be. We’re missing key members of the team and are doing well so far to gain as many points as possible in challenging circumstances.\n\nI’d expect it to be as close to the Arsenal game as possible, but with the added challenge of personnel changes. Like others have said, I’d expect it to be five at the back with the team trying to soak up as much pressure as possible.\n\nWe do have some interesting questions to consider. Will Ballard be fit? I think this fixture will come too soon, so we can expect Mukiele and Alderete to be working on their partnership.\n\nWhat do we do about left- and right-back? Despite the excellent block on the line in the last game, we have seen teams target Hume in recent games. Alongside this, it’s only Cirkin’s second game at this level. However, there’s no substitute for experience in this league, so what better chance to prove himself than against the very best?\n\nRegardless, I’ll be fully in support of the 11 that Régis picks on the night. Regardless of who starts and who finishes, this team has shown how committed they are until the final whistle. Regardless of the result, we can rest assured that maximum effort will be evident throughout.\n\nThis is the ultimate dilemma. What will give? The at-times unstoppable force of the Man City attack, or the immovable object of our unbeaten home run?\n\nWe know that our home record is something to be proud of and to be protected, but if we sit back and are too deep and defensive then we will likely succumb to the pressure and quality of City eventually.\n\nWith the absences we have, I think we will likely go with a back five of three centre-backs (Alderete, Mukiele, and hopefully Ballard, but more likely Geertruida) with wing-backs.\n\nWe need an out, some sort of a route to counter, and with a back 3/5 we can use the wide men as extra defenders when we have to, but retain the ability to break when we get the chance.\n\nIt may be a five-at-the-back focus for significant periods of the game, but we have to do something to stay in the game and to challenge when options arise.\n\nWe may well dabble with a 5-4-1 when without the ball, given that the midfield battle will also be fundamental to the outcome. As Brobbey is strong in holding play up while support arrives, giving Xhaka extra help in the middle may well help us too.\n\nThe main question the coach has to sort out is who can best staff the wisest of the available formations (in his view).\n\nWith the Leeds performance in mind, Adingra has made a significant claim for a start against Man City, and Eli Mayenda also showed what he can do if we need a quick and physical wide man who can attack with intent.\n\nCan these lads play as wing-backs, or do we need to use Cirkin and Hume, which could be challenging against such an opponent (and was at times against Leeds)?\n\nThe one thing we have which will help us is Régis Le Bris. If anyone can get a tune out of our available lads against one of the main title challengers, it’s Reggie.\n\nHe may well go totally against what I’ve suggested and stick with a back four. He may go for it entirely. What he does often surprises me, and he will want to surprise Pep as much as he can too.\n\nWhat I am confident of is the gaffer will have learned from the loss at the Etihad, and he will get these lads to graft their arses off to protect our defensive record – and maybe do even more.\n\nIf we lose but give it our best shot, which is a risk with the absences we have and the class of this opponent, then we have to take that on the chin and keep building with the next one.\n\nWe earned the right to play these teams, so we need to give it our all and leave nothing in the tank.\n\nIf we lose our unbeaten home record to the champions-to-be, we won’t be the only ones who have succumbed this way.\n\nOur home record will still be very good if it has just one blemish on it. Let’s not forget that.\n\nBring it on; let’s show these guys what we can do.\n\nWithout doubt, it’s our biggest challenge of the season. We are missing the pace of the players who are at the AFCON, so City will not be as concerned with the speed of our counter-attacks as they may have been in the game a few weeks ago. Ballard will be a big miss, and we may well need to go to a back five with a holding midfielder in front of the three. The concern is that from what we have seen so far, City are the side we have played that can best break down the opposition. We took Arsenal on and in many ways had the better of it.\n\nWe cannot simply look to keep them out, and I think Brobbey may well be key as his ability to muscle the City defence and hold the ball up is likely to give us a significant out-ball if we are under pressure. The best form of defence is attack, but we will need to be drilled compact, keep our concentration, and be ruthless when chances come our way. A big test, but our home has been our fortress.",

    "fullText": "RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Carolina Hurricanes goalie Pyotr Kochetkov likely will miss the rest of the season after opting for surgery for a lingering lower-body injury.\n\nIt’s another blow for the Hurricanes, who held the best record in the Eastern Conference at 23-11-3 entering Monday night’s game against the New York Rangers.\n\n“It’s what he has been dealing with all year,” Carolina coach Rod Brind’Amour said. “He has decided to have surgery, so he’s going to be out for probably the year.”\n\nKochetkov is 6-2-0 this season with a 2.33 goals against average in nine outings. He has yet to undergo the surgery.\n\n“Didn’t feel right all year,” Brind’Amour said. “He has been playing great, so that’s the hard part. He has been kind of fighting through it. But he doesn’t want to continue that way, so we’ll get it fixed and go from there.”\n\nKochetkov, 26, had been slated to be in the net against the Rangers. He shut out New York with 26 saves Nov. 4 in New York.\n\nHis last outing, Dec. 20 at Tampa Bay, he allowed five goals on 28 shots to the Lightning.\n\nThe Hurricanes are likely to rely even more heavily on rookie goalie Brandon Bussi, who drew Monday night’s assignment. Veteran Frederik Andersen has been erratic in 15 games with a 5-8-2 record, with losses in his last seven appearances.\n\nIt has been a challenging opening 2½ months for the Hurricanes because of injuries. Seth Jarvis, who leads the team with 19 goals, sat out his fourth consecutive game Monday with an injury.\n\n“You lose arguably your best player offensively in that spot, so you’ve got to fill it,” Brind’Amour said.\n\nThe Hurricanes, who lead the Metropolitan Division, claimed forward Noah Philp off waivers from the Edmonton Oilers. He wasn’t available to play Monday.\n\nCarolina played without Shayne Gostisbehere, whose 29 points are more than twice any other defenseman on the team. He had three points Saturday night, but was scratched with an ailment.\n\nDefenseman K’Andre Miller moved back into the lineup to face his former team. Defenseman Gavin Bayreuther, who was recalled earlier in the day from Chicago of the AHL, was scratched.\n\nBrind’Amour said the Hurricanes had a couple of seasons without long injury lists. Now, he regularly juggles lineups.\n\n“This is kind of unprecedented,” he said. “Every team has a certain degree of it. … You got to figure it out.”\n\nThe Hurricanes had season-worst three-game losing streak before winning Saturday against the Atlantic Division-leading Detroit Red Wings.\n\n“It’s a testament to the guys who are playing every night,” Brind’Amour said.",

    "fullText": "Former Tottenham Hotspur chairman Daniel Levy has been awarded a CBE in the United Kingdom’s New Year Honours list in recognition of his services to charity and the local community (h/t The Athletic).\n\nThe 63-year-old led Spurs for almost a quarter of a century from 2001 until his departure in September, making a massive impact in North London.\n\nLevy said he was humbled by the honour and paid tribute to the people he worked alongside during his time with Tottenham.\n\nIn a statement, he praised the extraordinary efforts made to create genuine and lasting change in the local area.\n\nThe CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) is one of the highest civilian honours in the UK, ranking above an OBE and MBE and sitting just below a knighthood or damehood.\n\nLevy’s award primarily reflects Tottenham’s extensive community work during his tenure.\n\nThe club established the Tottenham Hotspur Foundation in 2006, which has led outreach programmes in education, employment, health and social inclusion.\n\nThe opening of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in April 2019 was also cited as a catalyst for regeneration, bringing jobs, investment and major events, including NFL games, concerts and boxing, to the area.\n\nLevy said Tottenham had always been more than a football club to him, adding that he hoped his legacy would be measured not only by trophies or infrastructure but by the positive impact on people’s lives.\n\nTributes followed from figures across sport and the community.\n\nFormer sports minister Tracey Crouch said Levy deserves his honour for transforming the club and significantly improving the local area.\n\nJan Balon, headteacher of the London Academy of Excellence Tottenham (backed by Spurs) credited Levy’s vision with giving thousands of young people life-changing opportunities.\n\nLevy’s 24-year reign ended abruptly earlier this season, but his influence on Tottenham’s infrastructure, community engagement and standing within English football remains widely acknowledged.",

    "description": "As bad as you think it might have been, it was worse.",
    "fullText": "The Arizona Cardinals had a bad offensive performance on Sunday in their 37-14 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals. It was their worst offensive performance of the season.\n\nThey scored a season-low 14 points and gained a season-low 233 yards. Do you think that is bad?\n\nThat performance came against the Bengals, who have allowed the most yards in the NFL and the second-most points in the league. The fewest yards the Bengals had allowed previously was 317.\n\nGuess what? It gets even worse.\n\nThe 233 yards, as bad as it is for an offensive performance, is misleading.\n\nOf the 233 yards, 149 came in two fourth-quarter drives in clear garbage time. They trailed 37-7 before those two possessions. In the first three quarters, they had seven possessions, punted six times, picked up only four first downs and had only 84 yards. They went three-and-out five times.\n\nOf the 84 yards in the first three quarters, 70 came on their one touchdown drive in the second quarter, with 38 coming on Michael Wilson's touchdown. The other six possessions, they gained 14 yards.\n\nQuarterback Jacoby Brissett's final numbers looked fine, going 21-for-37 passing for 212 yards and two touchdowns. However, before the fourth quarter, he was 6-for-16 for 74 yards and a score, and 38 of those came on one play.\n\nOver the last eight games since the Cardinals beat the Dallas Cowboys and named Brissett the starter, the offense has averaged only 18.5 points per game and has not scored more than 20 points in the last six games. And that has happened while playing five games when losing by three or more scores, giving them plenty of garbage time to get easy yards and points.\n\nBrissett himself is having a solid statistical year. He has 21 touchdown passes to seven interceptions and has passed for a career-high 3,123 yards. However, those numbers come in the context of going 1-10 in his 11 starts and leading an offense that has gone downhill over the last two months. Even his numbers on Sunday didn't look bad, passing for 212 yards and two touchdowns, but 74 yards came before the Cardinals trailed by 30.\n\nSadly, it means that Brissett's numbers are largely empty numbers. What do they matter if they don't score consistently and trail most the game?\n\nAs bad as things looked early in the season, what we saw on Sunday was worse.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

    "fullText": "Will the Rams play their starters in Week 18 against the Cardinals? originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams saw their grip on the NFC’s top seed — and the NFC West title — disappear over the span of two weeks, leaving them headed into the postseason as a wild-card team.\n\nMonday night’s surprising loss to the Atlanta Falcons (7-9) sealed that reality, as the Rams (11-5) fell behind 21-0 by halftime and never fully recovered.\n\nThe defeat also effectively ended Matthew Stafford’s MVP momentum. By the break, the Rams quarterback had thrown multiple interceptions, and Los Angeles found itself chasing the game instead of controlling its postseason destiny. Although the Rams mounted a second-half comeback, the damage had already been done.\n\nWith one week left in the regular season, Los Angeles is now locked into either the fifth or sixth seed in the NFC, regardless of its Week 18 result. There’s also a scenario in which the Rams could be locked into the No. 6 seed before they even take the field Sunday afternoon, should the San Francisco 49ers win Saturday night. That possibility raised questions about whether head coach Sean McVay might choose to rest his starters against the Arizona Cardinals.\n\nMcVay, however, left little room for interpretation.\n\n“Oh, we’re playing. They’re playing,” he said postgame.\n\nAsked whether Monday night’s loss factored into that decision, McVay insisted the plan never changed, even though he has downplayed seeding in recent season finales. His focus, he said, is simply getting his team back on track before the playoffs.\n\n“They were going to play anyways,” he said. “We need to play. We need to play better football. I don’t know what the consequences are as far as those different types of things, but we’ve got to play better.”\n\nFor the Rams, Week 18 now serves less as a tune-up for seeding and more as a necessary reset heading into the postseason.",

    "description": "Vegas has dropped four of its last five and fell behind 5-0 to Minnesota Monday night.",
    "fullText": "And when the exact same scenario happened again in the second period, well, that’s just bad karma.\n\nOr maybe the blame lies with the Backstreet Boys, who showed up and cranked the rally siren prior to puck drop. Hey, when in doubt, blame the boy band.\n\nIn any event, the Golden Knights were due for a stinker and did they deliver Monday night at T-Mobile Arena. Vegas spotted the Minnesota Wild a 5-0 lead and it resulted in one of the Knights’ worst performances of the season, a 5-2 drubbing as they’ve now dropped four of their last five games.\n\nThe Knights were no-shows in their own building for much of the contest, much the way the Raiders failed to show up Sunday at Allegiant Stadium. The major difference was the Knights weren’t looking to lose and had no upside to getting beat.\n\n“They were on top of us early,” coach Bruce Cassidy said. “You’ve got to do a better job of getting out on the shooters. Too many easy plays for them.\n\n“We’ve got to plug some holes. It’s five goals (tonight). It’s five goals against Colorado. Five against Calgary. Four against Edmonton. We have to start there. We just have to. That’s an area we have to get better at.”\n\nFor Carter Hart, it was a night he’d just as soon forget. He was making his fourth straight start in goal and he was dented by Marcus Johansson 26 seconds into the match. He would surrender five goals on just 12 shots, including another Minnesota goal 26 seconds into the second period by Jared Spurgeon. Cassidy mercifully pulled him in favor of Akira Schmid after Joel Erikkson Ek tallied Minnesota’s fifth goal just shy of the seven-minute mark of the middle stanza.\n\nBut the Knights’ woes were just starting.\n\nTomas Hertl, who plays hard most shifts, crossed the line just over two minutes into the contest as he clobbered Ryan Hartman from behind along the boards in the Vegas end. He was assessed a five-minute boarding major along with a game misconduct.\n\nYet despite being shy for a long stretch, Vegas managed to avoid giving up a goal. For that, it can thank Brayden McNabb who prevented a sure goal by clearing the puck out of the crease before it could cross the goal line and into the net.McNabb would be the one who broke Filip Gustavsson’s shutout bid late in the second with a wrist shot from just inside the left circle to cut the deficit to 5-1. He was easily Vegas’ best player Monday night.\n\nThe Knights got as close as 5-2 on a Mark Stone goal early in the third period. But the Wild were not about to let this one get away from it. John Hynes’ guys settled down and while they couldn’t get one past Schmid, who stopped all 15 shots he faced in relief, Minnesota’s territorial play was good enough to secure the win, dropping the Knights into second place in the Pacific Division behind Edmonton, which won in Winnipeg Monday night, 3-1.\n\n“That goal to start the second period, we’re trying to get back in the game, we’ve got 40 minutes and the next goal, you’re right there. We’re one shot away,” Cassidy said. “But it didn’t happen and it snowballed from there.”  \n\nThey would lose defenseman Zach Whitecloud for a brief time in the third period after he and teammate Noah Hanifin collided and Whitecloud appeared to get the worst of it, unable to put weight on his left leg as left the ice and went down the tunnel to the Vegas dressing room. Whitecloud was able to return late in the period, which was good news.\n\nThere was more good news from earlier in the day, as center Jack Eichel participated in a red non-contact jersey during the team’s morning skate. And while Eichel didn’t play against the Wild, his sixth straight game he has missed with a lower-body injury and illness, he could return Wednesday for the New Year’s Eve matinee against Nashville.\n\nStill, this was a night the Golden Knights would just as soon forget. And they’ll get a chance to put this one behind them in less than 48 hours.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea host Bournemouth at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday night, knowing a win would provide a timely lift before the curtain falls on 2025.\n\nThe Blues are heading into this must-win contest after a frustrating 2-1 defeat against Aston Villa.\n\nEnzo Maresca’s side dominated the opening proceedings with Joao Pedro giving Chelsea the lead in the 37th minute after steering home a dangerous Reece James free kick.\n\nChelsea restricted Villa from having the ball and made sure Unai Emery’s troops went into the break without recording a single shot.\n\nFor an hour, the Blues were in cruise control until Ollie Watkins entered the fray and helped Villa turn the game on its head.\n\nChelsea capitulated in front of their own fans as Watkins bagged a brace to end the Blues’ four-match unbeaten home run.\n\nThat defeat saw Chelsea slip to fifth in the table, three points behind Liverpool and only ahead of Manchester United on goal difference.\n\nMaresca will be uneasy that his side have now won just once in their last five league outings (D2, L2) – a run that includes a goalless draw away to Bournemouth earlier this month.\n\nChelsea will take some confidence from the fact that they’ve won two of their last three home games against the Cherries, although James’ late free kick spared their blushes in the most recent 2-2 draw.\n\nHowever, the Blues tend to fare well when they wrap up the year on home turf, losing just one of their last 22 such games (W13, D8).\n\nThe wheels began to come off for Chelsea when Maresca made a handful of second-half changes that allowed Villa back into the game.\n\nThey were untouchable for an hour, so Maresca will likely stick to the same XI, although there could be a minor tweak due to fitness concerns.\n\nRobert Sanchez is guaranteed to start in goal. Wesley Fofana could return to the XI to partner Trevoh Chalobah.\n\nMalo Gusto could also come in for James, who put in an 8/10 performance in the Villa defeat.\n\nMaresca may opt to rest James from the start while Marc Cucurella retains his spot at left back.\n\nMoises Caicedo and Enzo Fernandez should continue to anchor the midfield while Pedro Neto, Cole Palmer, and Alejandro Garnacho form the supporting cast behind striker Joao Pedro.",

    "fullText": "Tottenham Hotspur defender Radu Dragusin has opened up on his long recovery journey after undergoing surgery to correct an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) damage.\n\nThe 23-year-old centre back strained his ACL in the latter stages of Tottenham’s 3-0 Europa League win over Elfsborg back in February.\n\nDragusin has been working on getting back to full fitness and even featured in a behind-closed-doors friendly game.\n\nThe Romanian centre-back finally marked his return in Tottenham’s narrow 1-0 win against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park after nearly a year on the sidelines.\n\nHis five-minute cameo in the London derby helped Tottenham’s cause as they held on to claim a crucial victory after back-to-back defeats against Nottingham Forest and Liverpool.\n\nDragusin has admitted that his 11-month journey to recovery tested him both physically and mentally – one he now calls the biggest challenge of his life.\n\n“It’s been a long journey, the biggest challenge of my life,” he told SPURSPLAY. “I just kept going. I had people next to me who helped me, my team-mates, my family, and my fiance.\n\n“I knew the road was going to be long, but I knew there was going to be a light at the end of it. Today, I’ve seen the light. I can’t even describe the feeling I’m having.”\n\nDragusin has wasted no time outlining his target for 2026. The centre-back is convinced he has what it takes to fight for a starting role and is eager to prove himself from the start of the new year.\n\n“I learned to have patience and believe in doing the right things over and over again,” he added.\n\n“A big part of my recovery was just doing the same things over and over again, just to get better at it and have a normal knee again.\n\n“It looks easy, but it’s a pretty big thing that the surgeon did in my knee. So, just to come back from that and perform at the level the Premier League asks you to perform, it takes time.\n\n“I’m just hoping to come back onto the pitch and fight for my place. Hopefully, this year is going to be an even better one than 2025 for us as a team.”",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is still keen on removing Jerome Powell as chair of the Federal Reserve.\n\nNear the end of his Monday briefing at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, a reporter asked Trump if he would tell Powell to resign. The president said he was \"getting pretty close,\" adding, \"I would fire him.\"\n\nHe said he would announce Powell's replacement sometime in January. His comments came at the end of the briefing, which he held with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nDuring the briefing, Trump threw several insults at Powell, calling him \"an absolute fool.\" He also brought out a common insult, \"too late Powell,\" a reference to Powell not lowering interest rates as quickly as Trump wanted him to.\n\nTrump said he would launch a \"gross incompetence lawsuit\" against the Fed chair, repeating his old criticisms of Powell not lowering interest rates and spending too much on a renovation of the Federal Reserve building.\n\nIn response to a request for comment from Business Insider, a Fed representative said he had nothing to add.\n\nPowell, 72, has served as the Fed's chair since 2017, when Trump nominated him to the top job during his first term. He was reappointed for a second term in 2022, which is set to end in May 2026.\n\nTrump has repeatedly called for Powell's resignation since the start of his term.\n\nIn April, he said in a Truth Social post that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough,\" after the chair criticized his wide-ranging tariffs and said they could lead to high inflation and weak economic growth.\n\nIn July, sources confirmed to Business Insider that Trump had asked a group of lawmakers about firing Powell, and they gave him their approval for the decision.\n\nHowever, Trump appeared to backtrack that same month, saying that he was \"highly unlikely\" to take that step and that his administration would choose someone else for the role within the next eight months.",

    "fullText": "Several passengers on a Ryanair flight travelling from Birmingham to Tenerife were injured after the aircraft encountered turbulence shortly after takeoff, forcing it to return to the UK.\n\nRyanair said in a statement to Business Insider that flight FR1121, which departed Birmingham Airport on Sunday, turned back \"shortly after take-off due to air turbulence.\"\n\n\"The aircraft landed normally before passengers disembarked and returned to the terminal, where a small number of passengers were provided with medical assistance,\" the airline said. The flight later resumed its journey to Tenerife, departing again at 9:06 p.m. local time, it added.\n\nFlight-tracking data from Flightradar24 shows the Boeing 737 Max departed Birmingham at about 3:05 p.m. on December 28, about 15 minutes later than its scheduled departure time.\n\nThe flight-tracking website said in a post on X on Monday that the aircraft squawked 7700 as it returned to Birmingham. The transponder code is a general emergency signal used by pilots to alert air-traffic controllers that the plane requires immediate assistance.\n\nThe aircraft also descended to about 10,000 feet during the diversion back to Birmingham, according to Flightradar24. Flightradar24 said on X that such a descent \"often indicates an aircraft pressurization issue.\"\n\nRyanair did not respond to Business Insider's questions about the number of passengers who required medical assistance, when the turbulence occurred, or the procedures followed on board.\n\nThe incident adds to a growing list of turbulence-related disruptions this year, as the climate crisis increases the risk of turbulence.\n\nA Delta Air Lines plane was hit by \"significant\" turbulence while flying over Wyoming in July, injuring 25 people, the airline said.\n\nAviation experts have warned that turbulence can appear suddenly and can pose risks to passengers who are not seated or wearing seatbelts.",

    "description": "China is weighing new controls on AI training, requiring consent before chat logs can be used to improve chatbots and virtual companions.",
    "fullText": "China is moving to tighten one of the most common ways AI systems improve: Learning directly from conversations with users.\n\nThe Cyberspace Administration of China said in a statement published Saturday that it has drafted measures that would restrict how AI platforms can collect and use chat logs for model training.\n\nThe proposal aims to ensure that \"human-like\" interactive AI services, including chatbots and virtual companions, are safe and secure for users, the statement said.\n\nChina encourages innovation in \"human-like\" interactive AI, but will pair that with governance and prudent, tiered supervision to \"prevent abuse and loss of control,\" it added.\n\nUnder the draft rules, platforms would need to inform users when they are interacting with AI and provide options to access or delete their chat history. Using conversation data for model training — or sharing it with third parties — would require explicit user consent, the agency said.\n\nFor minors, providers would need additional consent from a guardian before sharing their conversation data with third parties. Guardians would also have the right to request deletion of a minor's chat history.\n\nThe draft measures are open for public consultation, with feedback due in late January.\n\nIf finalized, the rules could slow the pace at which AI chatbots improve, Lian Jye Su, the chief analyst at Omdia, a technology research and consulting firm, told Business Insider.\n\nRestricting access to chat logs may \"limit the human-feedback mechanisms in reinforcement learning, which has been critical to the rise of engaging and accurate conversational AI,\" Su said.\n\nThat said, China's AI ecosystem is \"robust,\" and the country has access to massive public and proprietary datasets, he added.\n\nSu said the move aligns with Beijing's broader emphasis on national security and the collective public interest. Tightening controls over chat logs signals that certain user conversations are too sensitive to be treated as free training data, he added.\n\nWei Sun, the principal analyst for AI at Counterpoint Research, told Business Insider these provisions \"function less as brakes and more as directional signals.\"\n\n\"The emphasis is on protecting users and preventing opaque data practices, rather than constraining innovation,\" she said.\n\nSun said the draft encourages providers — once safety and reliability are proven — to expand the use of human-like AI across more application areas, including cultural dissemination and companionship for older adults.\n\n\"In the context of a rapidly aging population, they can be read as an explicit policy nudge to accelerate the development of human-like AI interactions in a regulated, socially constructive, and scalable manner,\" she added.\n\nChina's new draft rules on chatlog data come as concerns grow over how AI companies handle deeply personal user conversations.\n\nBusiness Insider reported in August that contract workers employed by Meta and other tech giants can read user conversations with chatbots as part of the process of evaluating AI responses.\n\nSeveral contractors told Business Insider that the material they reviewed contained sensitive details that could be used to identify individual users. Many of the conversations were highly personal, including exchanges that resembled therapy sessions, private chats with close friends, or intimate conversations with romantic partners.\n\nMeta's AI terms of service said that it \"may review\" user chatlogs with its AI products, either through automated systems or human reviewers.\n\nA Meta spokesperson told Business Insider that the company has \"strict policies\" over who can access personal data.\n\n\"While we work with contractors to help improve training data quality, we intentionally limit what personal information they see, and we have processes and guardrails in place instructing them how to handle any such information they may encounter,\" the spokesperson said in the August report.\n\nA Google engineer in AI security told Business Insider earlier this month that there are certain things he would never share with chatbots.\n\n\"AI models use data to generate helpful responses, and we users need to protect our private information so that harmful entities, like cybercriminals and data brokers, can't access it,\" he said.",

But I also think at the same time, not everybody is going to win at this.\"\n\nKatzenberg served as chairman of Walt Disney Studios for 10 years until 1994 and cofounded DreamWorks after his departure. As DreamWorks' CEO, he oversaw the production of hits like \"Shrek,\" \"Madagascar,\" and \"Kung Fu Panda.\"\n\nHe stepped down in 2016 and cofounded the venture capital firm WndrCo with former Dropbox Chief Financial Officer Sujay Jaswa in 2017. WndrCo's investments include Cursor, Harvey, and Figma.\n\nWndrCo's general partner, ChenLi Wang, also shared on the podcast how he and Katzenberg evaluate startups in the AI era.\n\n\"First, I think through our entire careers pre-WndrCo, Jeffrey's entire career, we've been people people,\" Wang said. \"The ingenuity and creativity of people and how magical their spikes are, and how, when you complement people and what they can create together, is the secret sauce.\"\n\nWang added that he and Katzenberg have never \"assessed our best humans based on benchmarks.\"\n\n\"I mean, how many years have people have parents complained about standardized testing dumbing down their kids,\" Wang said. \"And yet, I think we're going down the same route with the first wave of benchmarks.\"\n\nLike the two partners, research scientists have also criticized benchmarks because they overvalue superficial traits.\n\nIn a March blog post, Dean Valentine, the cofounder and CEO of AI security startup ZeroPath, said that \"recent AI model progress feels mostly like bullshit.\"\n\nValentine said that he and his team had been evaluating the performance of different models claiming to have \"some sort of improvement\" since the release of Anthropic's 3.5 Sonnet in June 2024. None of the new models his team tried had made a \"significant difference\" in his company's internal benchmarks or in developers' abilities to find new bugs, he said.\n\nIn a February paper titled \"Can we trust AI Benchmarks?\" researchers at the European Commission's Joint Research Center found that major issues exist in the current evaluation approach.\n\nThe researchers said that benchmarks \"often prioritize state-of-the-art performance at the expense of broader societal concerns.\"",

    "title": "Glamorous Christmas: Bringing Charm to Ruby",
    "description": "marcoroth.dev - website and blog",
    "fullText": "Today, Ruby 4.0 was released. What an exciting milestone for the language!\n\nThis release brings some amazing new features like the experimental Ruby::Box isolation mechanism, the new ZJIT compiler, significant performance improvements for class instantiation, and promotions of Set and Pathname to core classes. It’s incredible to see how Ruby continues to thrive and be pushed forward 30 years after its first release.\n\nTo celebrate this release, I’m happy to announce that I’ve been working on porting the Charmbracelet Go terminal libraries to Ruby, and today I’m releasing a first version of them. What better way to make this Ruby 4.0 release a little more glamorous and charming?\n\nI’ve been a huge fan of the Charm terminal libraries for years. I’ve always loved the aesthetics and the look & feel of the Charm libraries. Every time I see a CLI tool built with them, I get a little envious. The attention to detail, the smooth animations, the gorgeous styling, it all just feels right. I’ve spent more time than I’d like to admit just playing around with their demos and admiring how polished everything looks.\n\nFor a long time, I wished we had something like this in Ruby. So I finally decided to stop wishing and start building. Spoiler: some of these are pure Ruby ports, while others are bindings to their Go-library counterparts.\n\nCharmbracelet is an open source project building tools for the terminal. Their tagline is “We make the command line glamorous.”, and they truly deliver on that promise.\n\nThe Charm team believes that developer experience is user experience. APIs and CLIs are user interfaces at the end of the day, and they deserve the same care and attention as any visual design. This philosophy has led them to build some of the most beautiful and well-designed terminal libraries in any language.\n\nWhat sets Charm apart is that their tools make people feel something. When you see a Charm-powered application for the first time, there’s a moment of delight, a “wow, I didn’t know the terminal could look like this.” That’s not an accident. It’s the result of caring deeply about craft and aesthetics in a space where most tools are purely functional.\n\nOne of their key insights was separating structure from style, mirroring how the web separates HTML from CSS. Lipgloss handles styling and layout, while Bubble Tea provides the application architecture. This separation makes it easy to build complex UIs without mixing concerns.\n\nThe Charm libraries are thoughtfully designed with composable pieces that work together beautifully:\n\nEach library solves one problem well, and together they form a complete toolkit for building beautiful terminal applications.\n\nRuby has always been a joy to work with. They say Ruby is a programmer’s best friend, and I think that’s true. For 30 years, the language has embodied a philosophy of making coding more human, intuitive, and enjoyable. Matz built Ruby around the Principle of Least Surprise, valuing craftsmanship and expressive code over hype-driven trends. It’s a language that cares about how things feel.\n\nCharm shares that same DNA. Their tools prioritize developer happiness, expressiveness, and craft. When I discovered Charm, I immediately thought: this belongs in Ruby.\n\nWe have great tools for building CLIs, but when it comes to building rich, interactive, beautiful terminal applications, we’ve been missing the kind of cohesive ecosystem that Charm provides for Go.\n\nI wanted to change that. Ruby developers deserve glamorous terminals too. I want Ruby developers to build terminal applications so beautiful that even people who “don’t like CLIs” find themselves captivated.\n\nThese ports aim to bring that same level of polish and developer experience to Ruby. Quick script or full-blown TUI app, you should be able to make it look stunning with minimal effort.\n\nThis project is part of a broader movement happening in the Ruby community. Over the past few years, we’ve seen an incredible focus on improving the developer experience, and it’s been driven by a key insight: strategic standardization enables innovation.\n\nJust as Rails revolutionized web development by standardizing conventions, the Ruby ecosystem is now applying the same principle to developer tooling. By standardizing foundational layers, we free ourselves to build richer, more powerful tools on top.\n\nThis extends beyond individual tools. Protocols like LSP (Language Server Protocol), DAP (Debug Adapter Protocol), and now MCP (Model Context Protocol) provide shared infrastructure that unifies how tools communicate. Instead of every editor implementing language support from scratch, LSP gives us a common language. Instead of every debugger reinventing the wheel, DAP provides a shared foundation. These protocols enable an explosion of interoperable tooling.\n\nAnd that’s the key insight: when you build strong foundations, the community builds incredible things on top. Give developers the right building blocks, and they’ll create tools you never imagined.\n\nThis story extends across the Ruby ecosystem:\n\nThe Ruby ecosystem is investing heavily in making the development experience more polished, more intelligent, and more delightful. From better editor support to faster parsers to type checking, Ruby is leveling up.\n\nBringing Charm to Ruby fits right into this story. It’s about raising the bar for what Ruby developers can build and how good it can look. The terminal is often where we spend our time as developers, and it deserves the same attention to developer experience as our editors and IDEs.\n\nCSS-like styling for terminal output. Define colors, borders, padding, margins, and alignment with a clean, chainable API. Includes support for tables, lists, and tree structures.\n\nThe Elm-inspired TUI framework. Build interactive terminal applications using the Model-View-Update architecture.\n\nPre-built TUI components for Bubble Tea: spinners, progress bars, text inputs, text areas, viewports, lists, tables, file pickers, and more.\n\nStylesheet-based Markdown rendering for the terminal. Supports syntax highlighting, multiple themes, and custom styles via a Ruby DSL.\n\nA simple, powerful library for building interactive forms and prompts. Includes inputs, selects, multi-selects, confirms, spinners, validation, and theming.\n\nA simple, physics-based animation library. Damped spring oscillators for smooth, natural motion in your terminal UIs.\n\nMouse event zones for TUIs. Mark regions as clickable and easily determine which component was clicked in your Bubble Tea applications.\n\nMark regions with zone identifiers\n\nCheck if mouse event is in bounds\n\nA tool for glamorous shell scripts. Ruby wrapper for Charm’s gum binary with an idiomatic API for inputs, selects, confirms, spinners, styled output, and more.\n\nNimble Terminal Charts. Visualize data beautifully with sparklines, bar charts, line charts, time series, heatmaps, and more.\n\nAll gems (except huh) are available on RubyGems.org:\n\nFor huh, add it to your Gemfile from GitHub (we reached out to the current owner of the huh gem and are hoping to be able to publish the gem under the huh name in the future):\n\nYou can find more information at charm-ruby.dev. All libraries are open source and available on GitHub:\n\nThis is just the beginning. These are initial releases, and there’s plenty more to do.\n\nThe first pass was primarily focused on getting the Go functionality ported to Ruby. Now the real work begins: making these libraries feel more Ruby-like and idiomatic. I want to improve how the libraries work and integrate with each other, add more pre-built components, and make it even easier to get started building beautiful terminal applications.\n\nThese are early releases, and there’s still work to be done. Some of the Go-based gems have quirks when used together due to how Goroutines are initialized. I’m actively working on these, and I’d rather build in public with the community than wait for everything to be perfect.\n\nBut here’s what really excites me: imagine what we could build together. Think about all the CLI tools, test runners, generators, installers, and framework scripts we use every day.\n\nWhat if they were all a little more polished, a little more interactive, a little more glamorous? Rails generators with beautiful progress indicators. Test runners with live, filterable output. Bundler with elegant spinners and styled summaries. Or entirely new applications that weren’t really possible before, but now are. The possibilities are endless!\n\nI couldn’t wait to start exploring, so here are a couple of things I’ve been experimenting with:\n\nA Minitest plugin that uses Bubble Tea to run your tests with a beautiful, interactive interface. Inspired by Vitest’s terminal UI. The UI stays open after the run completes, letting you re-run the failed tests, filter to focus on specific tests, and enjoy a clean collapsible view that tucks away individual test cases when a file passes. Expand any file to see the details, or just enjoy the satisfying wall of green checkmarks. (You can also see the standalone Bubble Tea test runner demo in the Bubble Tea demos above.)\n\nA terminal rebuild of the Herb Playground, built entirely with these libraries. Type HTML+ERB code and switch between tabs to explore the parsed AST, tokens, extracted Ruby, extracted HTML, and any parser errors, all in a beautiful split-pane terminal UI.\n\nA special thank you to Anton Sozontov for transferring the gum gem name on RubyGems.org, and to Tomas Valent for transferring the bubbles gem name.\n\nThe terminal has been around for decades, but that doesn’t mean it has to feel dated. With the right tools, you can build software that genuinely delights.\n\nI hope these libraries inspire you to craft something that makes people stop and say “wow.”\n\nBut more than anything, I want to encourage you to build with these libraries. Build new tools. Upgrade your existing CLI applications to make them shinier, more glamorous, more beautiful. Add some color, some polish, some fun.\n\nThe terminal doesn’t have to be boring. Let’s make it glamorous.\n\nI’d love to hear your feedback and see what you create! You can find all the libraries at charm-ruby.dev and browse the full collection on my GitHub list.\n\nHappy Ruby 4.0 release day! Let’s make the Ruby command line glamorous.\n\nCode blocks highlighted by Torchlight.",

    "fullText": "The satellites were placed into orbit from Russia’s Vostochny Cosmodrome in a multi-payload launch that Iranian officials described as the country’s seventh satellite mission carried out using Russian launch vehicles.\n\n“These satellites were designed and manufactured by Iranian scientists, and both government bodies and the private sector have been involved,” Iran’s ambassador to Russia, Kazem Jalali, said in remarks published ahead of the launch.\n\n“Two of the satellites belong to the government and one belongs to the private sector, and our knowledge-based companies and universities are active in this field.”\n\nJalali said Iran had continued to advance its space capabilities despite international pressure. “Despite all the threats and sanctions that exist, we have something to say in this field.”\n\nIran’s space agency chief, Hassan Salarieh, said the launch reflected what he described as Iran’s standing among a small group of countries with end-to-end space capabilities.\n\n“Iran is among 10 or 11 countries in the world that simultaneously possess the capability to design and build satellites, launch vehicles and the infrastructure for launching, receiving data and processing images,” he said.\n\nSalarieh said Iran aimed to expand both the number and precision of its satellites. “What is necessary for us is increasing the number of satellites, improving their accuracy and quality, and developing different classes of satellites,” he said.\n\nIranian media identified the satellites as Paya, also known as Tolou-3, Zafar-2, and a prototype satellite called Kowsar-1.5. The spacecraft were launched alongside a large cluster of mainly Russian satellites into a sun-synchronous low Earth orbit.\n\nPaya (Tolou-3), built by the Iranian Space Agency, is Iran’s heaviest Earth-observation satellite to date, weighing about 150 kilograms.\n\nIranian officials say it is capable of producing black-and-white images with a resolution of about five meters and color images with a resolution of around 10 meters, and is intended for applications including agriculture, water management, environmental monitoring and disaster assessment.\n\nZafar-2, developed by Iran University of Science and Technology, is also an Earth-observation satellite designed for mapping, environmental monitoring and tracking natural hazards.\n\nKowsar-1.5 combines imaging and internet-of-things capabilities and is aimed primarily at agricultural and farm-monitoring uses, Iranian officials say.\n\nJalali described Iran’s space cooperation with Russia as extensive and said Moscow’s experience had played a key role.\n\n“Russia is advanced in the space field, including satellites, launch vehicles and satellite launches, and we have been able to transfer part of the technology and work together,” he said.\n\nHe also described the Soyuz rocket as highly reliable. “Before Russia’s relations with the West deteriorated, many Western satellites were launched using Soyuz,” Jalali said.\n\nThe launch also carried Russian Earth-observation satellites, internet-of-things platforms and university-built spacecraft, according to launch data, as well as satellites from partner countries including Belarus, Kuwait and Montenegro.\n\nIran says its space program is civilian and focused on scientific and economic goals, but Western governments argue that satellite launch technology overlaps with systems used to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles.\n\n“In my view, we are in an all-out war with the United States, Israel, and Europe; they do not want our country to stand on its own feet,” Masoud Pezeshkian said in an interview with the Supreme Leader’s official website.\n\nHe said the current war is worse than the Iraq war in the 1980s. “If one understands it properly, this war is far more complex and more difficult than that war.”\n\n“In the war with Iraq, the situation was clear; they fired missiles, and it was clear where we would strike back. But here, they are now besieging us in every respect, putting us under pressure and in tight corners, creating problems—economically, culturally, politically, and in terms of security.”\n\nPezeshkian made the comments on the eve of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's trip to the United States, where he plans to brief President Donald Trump on options for potential future strikes against Iran, amid concerns that Tehran is rebuilding ballistic missile production facilities and repairing air defenses damaged during the June conflict, according to NBC News.\n\nIsrael has told the United States that the recent Iranian missile drills may conceal preparations for a potential strike, Axios reported last Sunday, one day after Iran International reported unusual Iranian air activity spotted by Western intelligence agencies.\n\nIsraeli Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir raised the issue directly with Brad Cooper, head of US Central Command, warning that recent missile movements could serve as a cover for a surprise operation against the Jewish state.\n\nPezeshkian said on Saturday that Iran is \"stronger than during the 12‑day war\" with Israel in terms of equipment and manpower. \"If the enemy chooses confrontation, they will naturally face a more decisive response.\"\n\nIn June, Israel carried out airstrikes and covert operations against Iranian military and nuclear sites, killing more than 1,000 people including senior officials and nuclear scientists.\n\nIran retaliated by launching hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel, killing at least 33 people, among them an off-duty soldier.\n\nThe United States helped Israel intercept Iranian attacks and later joined the Israeli campaign, bombing three Iranian nuclear facilities on June 22.\n\n“In a joint operation by the IDF and the Shin Bet, Hussein Mahmoud Marshad al-Jawhari, a key operative in the Operations Unit of the Iranian Quds Force, was eliminated,” the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement posted on X.\n\n\"(al-Jawhari) operated under the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and was involved in terror activities directed by Iran against the State of Israel and security forces,\" the statement added.\n\nThe IDF said he was involved in “advancing terrorist attack plans against the State of Israel in the Syria–Lebanon arena.”\n\nIt added that al-Jawhari was a key operative in Quds Force’s Unit 840, which the IDF described as “the unit that directs and is responsible for Iranian terrorist activity against the State of Israel.”\n\nThe Quds Force, the external arm of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, conducts overseas operations to support allied groups and advance Tehran’s strategic interests.\n\nLebanon’s state news agency had earlier reported that two people were killed when an Israeli drone struck a vehicle near the Syrian border.\n\nA report by Israel Hayom, citing Israeli officials, said al-Jawhari was killed alongside another operative, identified as Majed Qansoua.\n\nA US-backed ceasefire agreed last November halted more than a year of fighting between Israel and Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah and called for the group to disarm.\n\nBoth Israel and Hezbollah have since accused each other of violating the ceasefire.\n\nIsrael has been carrying out strikes in Lebanon on an almost daily basis, which it says are aimed at preventing Hezbollah from rebuilding.\n\nIran, a longtime sponsor of Hezbollah, has rejected international and domestic calls for the group to disarm, arguing that continued Israeli actions justify its armed presence.\n\nOn Wednesday, former Afghan police general Ikramuddin Sari was shot dead by masked assailants near his home in Tehran, according to sources close to him.\n\nHe was attacked alongside an associate near their residence in southern Tehran and died while being transferred to hospital, the sources told Afghanistan International.\n\nSari, a former police commander in Baghlan and Takhar provinces, fled to Iran after the Taliban returned to power in 2021. Reports in recent months had suggested Iranian police had detained and questioned him, though no official explanation was given.\n\nTaliban's 'extraterritorial assassinations'\n\nThe killing follows the September shooting of Maroof Ghulami, a political and military figure close to veteran anti-Taliban leader Ismail Khan. He was killed by gunfire in the religious city of Mashhad.\n\nPeople close to both men have blamed the Taliban for their deaths, according to Afghanistan International.\n\nThe attacks, an Afghan military source said, signal the start of what he described as Taliban “extraterritorial assassinations,” adding that the group has repeatedly threatened to target opponents abroad.\n\nSenior Taliban official Mohammad Nabi Omari has previously said the group could kill opponents outside Afghanistan “with as little as 500 Pakistani rupees,” while Saeed Khosti, a former spokesperson for the de facto Taliban Ministry of Interior, warned two years ago that hundreds of volunteers were ready to target critics overseas.\n\nIranian authorities have remained publicly silent on Sari’s killing. Tehran has also provided no detailed update on the investigation into Ghulami’s death.\n\nIranian police said in September they arrested three suspects in that case but later released two, offering no clarity on affiliations.\n\nA source familiar with the investigation told Afghanistan International that the remaining suspect was a Taliban operative, a comment not confirmed by Iranian authorities.\n\nSari, originally from Kapisa province, was regarded as a professional officer who served as police commander in Nuristan, Baghlan and Takhar, and as an adviser to Afghanistan’s interior ministry.\n\nIn Iran, he acted as an informal representative for former Afghan soldiers, advocating for their rights, opposing deportations and openly criticizing the Taliban.\n\nThe National Resistance Front of Afghanistan (NRF), led by Ahmad Massoud, called on Iran to conduct a “transparent, serious and independent” investigation, describing Sari’s killing as a “targeted terrorist act.”\n\nThe Jamiat-e Islami Afghanistan, led by Salahuddin Rabbani, also condemned the killing and urged Iranian authorities to identify those responsible.\n\nIran, which has handed Afghanistan’s embassy in Tehran and the consulate in Mashhad to the Taliban, has faced growing criticism for failing to protect Afghan dissidents on its soil even as it seeks closer ties with the Taliban-led administration.\n\n“Israel does not have the capacity for an intense war of attrition or for confronting a major power like Iran, and it is clear that another war would not end in 12 days as the previous one did,” Javan wrote in an analysis on Wednesday.\n\nThe 12-day war between Iran and Israel in June 2025 was a brief but intense conflict. It began with extensive Israeli airstrikes on Iranian military and nuclear facilities.\n\nThe United States became militarily involved mid‑conflict. On June 22, US Air Force and Navy forces carried out coordinated strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities – Natanz, Fordow and Isfahan – in an operation codenamed Operation Midnight Hammer, using B‑2 bombers and submarine‑launched missiles, marking the first US offensive against Iranian territory in decades. Iranian forces fired missiles at US assets in Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, after those strikes.\n\nThe conflict ended with a US and Qatari-mediated ceasefire, but it caused significant casualties, infrastructure damage.\n\nIsraeli rhetoric, the paper said, has shifted from threats of decisive victory to language of caution and warnings about the costs of renewed conflict.\n\nAir strikes, according to Javan, failed to halt what it called Iran’s “distributed and self-sufficient” military production. The paper also argued that the previous fighting severely strained Israel’s multilayer missile defense systems.\n\n“Israeli officials are now openly speaking of the ‘real threat’ posed by Iran’s missiles and warning that without preventive action Iran could reach annual production of thousands of missiles,” the paper said.\n\nFocus shifts from battlefield to society\n\nJavan framed the change in tone as evidence that the military option has lost credibility, writing that the inability to control the consequences of war has weakened Israel’s long-standing doctrine of absolute military superiority.\n\n“War in the contemporary world is not merely a military confrontation, but a test of social capacity, political cohesion and national resilience,” the paper wrote, arguing that internal divisions, political strains and reliance on external support limit Israel’s ability to endure a prolonged conflict.\n\nThe article concluded that future confrontation will be shaped as much by narratives and domestic resilience as by missiles and air defenses.",

    "fullText": "“Every driver has a limit.  Mine is a little bit further than others.”\n\n— Ayrton Senna, greatest Formula One driver of all time\n‍\n\n“I’m not funny.  What I am is brave.”\n\n— Lucille Ball, greatest female comedian of all time\n‍\n\n“I’d rather be optimistic and wrong than pessimistic and right.”\n\n“I can outlearn you.  \nI can outread you.  \nI can outthink you.  \nAnd I can outphilosophize you.”\n\n— Robert De Niro as Max Cady, Cape Fear‍\n‍\n\n“I’m not superstitious, but I am a little stitious.”\n\n— Michael Scott, The Office, on how Bayesians form priors\n‍\n\nThe greatest treasure hunters know that the treasure they seek is not lost. It is waiting.\n\nStarting in 1969 and for 5,954 straight days, treasure hunter Mel Fisher sought what was waiting for him: the wreckage of the Nuestra Señora de Atocha, a Spanish galleon that sunk in 1622.\n\nHow do you recruit, retain, and motivate a crew when you are not sure when you will find the treasure, if you will find the treasure, or what the treasure will be worth? Fisher developed a powerful operating philosophy, captured in its entirety with three amazing words.\n\nEvery morning, for 16 years, Mel Fisher banged pots and pans in the pre-sunrise to rouse his crew, shouting and smiling, “Today’s the day, men. Today’s the day.”\n\nEventually it was true. On July 20, 1985, Mel and his crew discovered the most valuable shipwreck in history, 70 miles off the coast of Key West. The Atocha yielded gold and silver today worth more than $10 billion.\n\nFisher’s “today’s the day” philosophy reframed what could have otherwise been a mentally tortuous journey – will we ever find the treasure? Is it even here? – into daily play characterized by disciplined guessing, dispassionate refinement, and the singular goal of ending the day less wrong.\n\nFisher had never studied, or even heard of, Bayesian statistics. Yet, as we will see, his operating philosophy, and its daily ritual of iteration, was textbook Bayesian. Fisher also settled – for me – a foundationally important debate I had struggled with about the philosophy of probability theory which, in turn, provided me with an operating manual for leadership.\n\nArriving at the University of Chicago’s Ph.D. program in 1991, I, like Fisher, had never studied, or even heard of, Bayesian statistics. Yet, exposure the first day of my first class turned into a wandering, wondering, and still unabated obsession. I left the program five years later with a Ph.D. in Bayesian statistics (and finance), and my career has essentially been a three-decade extension of what I learned at Chicago. I now do Bayesian treasure hunting for a living.\n\nFancy math aside, the foundational idea of Bayesian statistics is simply learning from experience. Things get started with a “prior distribution”, which is what you think you know about what you want to know – for example, “Where is the treasure?” That “prior” is mixed with observable data – experience – to form a “posterior distribution”, a structured mashup of your prior and the data you collected.  The posterior represents your new view of what you want to know – for example, “I now know the treasure is not over there.”i\n\nThe power of Bayesian statistics is in the trade-off inherent in the framework. How much do you listen to your pre-wisdom intuition before it is enhanced by the data you collect, knowing your pre-data knowledge is limited, at best? How much do you listen to your new data, especially if it contradicts your pre-data intuition, knowing your limited sample may not lead you closer to the treasure, and might even throw you off the trail?\n\nWhen done with mastery, Bayesian statistics is a beautiful, egoless, daily practice of being less wrong.\n\nIn hindsight, every incoming University of Chicago Ph.D. student in 1991 – our collaborative little group of intellectually hungry sponges – was susceptible to becoming a Bayesian. Arnold Zellner, a giant in the history of Bayesian econometrics, towered, gently, over the business school’s statistics department, having just been named President of the American Statistical Association and – to me – a hilarious, wonderful, deeply caring professor. And though my own research was – and still is – focused on empirical asset pricing, my six-man dissertation committee ended up including four Bayesian statisticians, each a legend in the field.\n\nI recall as if it were yesterday my dissertation co-chairman Rob McCulloch teaching me that the Bayesian-required question “how do we set our priors?” illuminated a philosophical debate, still raging, about probability theory because that simple question is akin to asking, “What can we know prior to knowing?” I thought about that deeply for years.\n\nStudying Fisher, and treasure hunting, I now know that the answer is, often, a lot.\n\n“What’s an expert anyway? Just some guy from out of town.”\n\nConsider that Fisher knew to search off the coast of Florida and not, say, Australia. How? During his pre-search research at the Archivo General de Indias in Seville, Fisher discovered a faded 1622 salvage account describing the treasure fleet’s loss and references to survivors setting up camp in Cayos del Marques, or Key Largo today. So, Fisher’s prior variance was very large to start – search the Florida Keys – but not practically infinite – search all 140 million square miles of water on the surface of the planet.ii\n\nKnowing roughly where the Atocha sank and roughly the seasonal path of the current – that is, knowing prior to knowing before collecting any data from the sea – Fisher literally, and massively, shrunk the problem. Bayesian shrinkage, a foundational element of Bayesian statistics, involves pulling in especially noisy estimates – say, all oceans on Earth – closer to a central value – say, water off the coast of Florida. My dissertation – which applied new computational techniques in Bayesian shrinkage to old problems in finance – helped me see Fisher as a Bayesian.\n\nEvery day, Fisher, like any good Bayesian, updated his prior guess of where the Atocha was with data about where it definitely was not. Every day Fisher became a little less wrong.\n\nIn finding the Atocha in 16 years – and not 60, or never – Fisher adhered to Bayesian-adjacent principles that Alec Litowitz, founder of Magnetar Capital, and my former boss and mentor, writes about in his forthcoming and fascinating field guide for success, The Adaptability Quotient: Rewiring Your Mind for Success in the Next Human Era:\n\n“Confirmation bias is the worst enemy of iteration.  In a Bayesian system, it’s fatal. If you only accept the data that supports your hypothesis, you’re not updating – you’re entrenching. The people who learn fastest are the ones who are most willing to be wrong…with the humility to trade conviction for information, one update at a time.”\n\nFisher let the data speak and learned fast. In 1973, he found silver bars and coins matching the Atocha’s manifest.  Less wrong. Two years later, he discovered bronze cannons with Atocha markings. Even less wrong. Ten years after that, the motherlode. Absolutely right.\n\nAs students of the great Chicago Bayesians, we at Stone Ridge seek continual improvement in the speed of unbiased iterations. We are trained to privately ask ourselves, “Was I less wrong today?” Our progress depends on our eruptions of good questions, and truly listening to the answers. We would rather look dumb by asking, than not ask and be dumb. People forget if you looked dumb. They do not if you are.\n\nAs students of the great Bayesian Fisher, we at Stone Ridge know that success is not always linked to intelligence, boldness, or experience, but does consistently follow those most adaptive. In Litowitz-speak, it is not just IQ or EQ that matters, but AQ – adaptability quotient – a way of thinking that prioritizes learning over being right, and structure over rigidity. When the terrain shifts, do you update or insist?\n\nUpdating our prior – Chicago – with our data – Fisher – allows us to graduate with an extraordinarily valuable posterior because it contains X-marks-the-spot wisdom: markets overpay for stories of the future and underpay for hidden treasures of the past. That single Chicago-Fisherian insight caused us to make $3 billion in uncorrelated trading profits this year and $10 billion the last three. To see how, let’s go Bayesian treasure hunting and discover what awaits us buried in old reinsurance balance sheets and ancient Arkansas rock.\n\nIn 2023, amidst intense diligence for what ultimately became a $3 billion purchase of PDPsiii  in Arkansas’ Fayetteville Shale, we noticed that of the 860,000 acres included in the deal, 800,000 were covered with PDPs and 60,000 – all adjacent – were covered with grass. That’s a lot of undeveloped land.\n\n“Why are there no drilling rigs here?”\n\nWe decided to park our one major unanswered diligence question for the sake of efficiency, once convinced our PDP-only purchase could deliver our target returns.\n\nTwo years later, after taking over operations of the 5,596 wells we purchased – and our internally reframed responsibility of powering the homes of four million American families – the question resurfaced. “Why are there no rigs here?”\n\nThis time we could not shake it.\n\nWe learned that no one had drilled anything new for almost a decade, odd for a basin that size. A little stitious, we wondered, “Does treasure await?”\n\nWe suspected the previous owner’s “denominator problem” could explain their lack of drilling. They were an enormous company. Any marginal improvements in Fayetteville, despite being potentially large in dollar terms, would likely not move the needle in ROE, their north star.  In contrast, Stone Ridge operates every day with a “no basis point left behind” mindset. One basis point is our north star.  And, to us, large dollars will always be large dollars.\n\nWe also learned that two important aspects of drilling changed in the past decade: technologyiv and cost. Completion – the act of getting a drilled well to the point that gas steadily comes out of the ground for commercial purposes – now benefits from better drills, smarter rigs, more powerful fleets, and advanced digital control systems. And following a version of Moore’s Law, the new and better technology continually costs a lot less.\n\nWe decided to run a tightly controlled test program on our undeveloped land, drilling new wells, seeking fast, unbiased iterations, and updating – and hopefully tightening – the variance of our Bayesian prior – every day. Was there untapped gas under our 60,000 acres of grass? If so, where? If so, how much?\n\nOur approach was surgical. Two pads, five wells, disciplined design, unbiased data analysis, and adherence to the following mathematical identity.\n\nDrilling for natural gas ≡ searching for buried treasure in ancient rock\n\nThough we did not shout “today’s the day” every morning during our Fayetteville testing, we did feel Fisher-like energy as our ignorance shrank. Less wrong. Even less wrong. Absolutely right.\n\nEureka!  We found Fisher-like treasure.\n\nComposed of oil and gas, not gold and silver, our no-less-precious motherlode means that the $10 billion lifetime revenue we originally expected in Fayetteville now looks more like $15 billion. Discovering half an Atocha caused us to immediately shrink our priors in all seven U.S. basins we operate, a technical Bayesian statistical concept called “borrowing strength.” Our philosophy of probability theory, concretely applied to our Fayetteville test results, allowed us – with powerful practical efficiency – to know without knowing in the not-yet-tested basins. Less wrong.\n\nWe are now in the process of learning as much as is known about drilling before tapping our AQ to push the limit “a little further than others” and get closer to what is knowable. Every day counts because there’s gold oil and gas in them thar hills. It is waiting.\n\n“It may seem difficult at first, but all things are difficult at first.”\n\n— Miyamoto Musashi, The Book of Five Rings\n\nIn launching our energy franchise almost five years ago, we assumed our breakthroughs in proprietary financing and hedging technology – and the resulting material edge in our cost of funds – were sufficient conditions for best-in-class investment performance. We quickly and painfully learned, however, that financial sophistication cannot substitute for industrial control. In energy markets, physics – not finance – sets the tuition entrepreneurs must pay.\n\nA bit chastened, we updated our prior and then – fortuitously – met Flywheel Energy, by far the best operators in the industry, due in part to their entire executive team’s roots in elite military operations. Flywheel is now part of Stone Ridge.\n\nUnder Flywheel’s peerless leadership, and an unbeatable team of 794 superstars – including 569 in the field – we now operate our wells ourselves. With every colleague crisply aligned on, and unambiguously individually responsible for their specific part, maximizing a singular metric – total dollars of operating profit – physics and finance are now in sync. Industry-leading results have followed.\n\nSince inception, Stone Ridge Energy (SRE) has purchased almost $11 billion of energy assets, all via proprietary securitizations – no bankers, no information leakage, no fee leakage. Over that period, spot natural gas has traveled in a staggeringly wide and volatile range of $1.50/MMBtu to almost $9/MMBtu. Yet, across thirteen equity tranches, the integrated precision of Flywheel physics + Stone Ridge finance has produced >20%/year, with low volatility, and no correlation to anything.v\n\n“Never was a finer canvas presented to work on than our countrymen. All of them engaged in the pursuits of honest industry, independent in their circumstances, enlightened as to their rights, and firm in their habits of order.”\n\n— Thomas Jefferson in a letter to James Madison, 1796\n\nThe U.S. shale revolution required three actors, working in concert. First, unlimited underground supply of hydrocarbons. Second, technological breakthroughs to access it. Third, profit-seeking capital. Leveraging nature for the first part, SRE brings fresh thinking to the rest.\n\nPlay the tape forward five years and I do not see SRE as a larger version of what we are today. I see a different kind of company. SRE has a chance to matter in the same practical, civic way that a major rail line or a modern port matters. I would like us to.\n\nAt our pace of disciplined acquisitions, careful development, and unrelenting process improvement, SRE will be a top three U.S. producer of hydrocarbons. Managing that level of capital and molecule movement at our extraordinary level of operational excellence would meaningfully impact U.S. families, U.S. factories, and the competitiveness of this country. I would like us to.\n\nMore than 99% of the capital we manage at Stone Ridge, including SRE, comes from American investors. At our scale, that cannot happen by accident. At Stone Ridge, American capital produces American treasure.\n\nOn average and over time, treasure hunting in the sea is not a good business. Availability bias blinds us to the fact that for every Mel Fisher, dozens of others strike out. In fact, any too narrowly defined business is not a good business over a long enough time horizon.  Meta and abstract? No, Bayesian and practical. When the terrain shifts and you insist, your business surface area too is limited even for efficient Bayesian updating to help. In Litowitz-speak, your confirmation bias is fatal. It is just a matter of time.\n\nConsider legacy reinsurance. In contrast to prospective quota shares – aligned, partnership trades in which Stone Ridge shares risk pro rata with leading reinsurers, tapping into their masterful Bayesian updating cycle management skills across dozens of lines of business – legacy trades transfer retrospective risk from (re)insurance policies written years or decades ago.\n\nThe performance of legacy-only reinsurers is like that of lenders to too narrowly defined monoline credit originators (think: “only sub-prime auto” or “only UK small business”). Victims of confirmation bias’s siren song, monolines always – yes, always – originate unprofitable loans at the wrong time in the cycle.\n\nHealth warning: beware lending to monolines. When tight spreads persist, they insist.\n\nHealth warning: beware investing in legacy-only reinsurers. Confirmation bias dooms the business model and, along the way, guillotine-level adverse selection hangs over every trade. When a one-off risk-transfer price is highly attractive for clear and imperative strategic reasons, hyper-selective, non-legacy-only investors can profitably escape with their heads, but at Stone Ridge we know half-priced sushi does not mean it’s a bargain.\n\nA decade ago, there were about a dozen dedicated legacy firms and funds. Today, one large player remains, though recently its credibility detonated after initiating litigation against a client. The other remaining legacy-only firms are subscale or regionally focused. Enter Longtail Re.\n\nHumble beginnings, a clear vision\n\nStone Ridge began Longtail Re in 2020 focused on two simple ideas: 1) partner, not compete with the world’s best underwriters to generate a portfolio of hyper-diversified casualty liabilities that deliver low-cost float, and 2) invest that float in proprietary and valuable Stone Ridge-generated fixed income assets with superior risk-adjusted expected return.\n\nAlways open to Bayesian updating of its prior distribution core business model of prospective quota shares, Longtail Re’s positioning has always been: be available for new data and a reshaped posterior legacy transactions from motivated parties we know well and who call us, but do not be in the legacy business.\n\nOut of almost 100 legacy trade requests since inception, Longtail has written…three. Three.\n\nLongtail executed one of those three in November, a record $1.4 billion retrospective reinsurance transaction with Everest Group, an S&P 500 company, with whom Stone Ridge has an excellent, 13-year, uninterrupted trading relationship. Everest had compelling corporate reasons to de-risk, and the transaction with us, albeit enormous in the legacy space, was only one part of an even larger clear and imperative strategic repositioning of their entire firm. And of non-negotiable importance to us, we know (for many years), like, and trust Everest’s new CEO.\n\nThe trade has an outstanding expected return profile and diversifies Longtail’s core prospective portfolio because it covers past underwriting years back to 2003. It was also the largest legacy trade of Longtail CEO Mike Sapnar’s career, and mine.\n\nOn their most recent earnings call, Everest’s CEO said, “I was really, really glad that we were able to do this transaction with Longtail Re and Mike Sapnar...those are super credible underwriters. They did an excellent job evaluating the portfolio…it got to economics that will be very, very good for Longtail Re.” We agree.\n\nAs only Bayesian treasure hunting reinsurance geeks can, we internally renamed the core trade of the legacy reinsurance industry – a Loss Portfolio Transfer or LPT – to WPT. Waiting Portfolio Treasure.  Recall I said geeks. And who wants losses?\n\nLongtail ends 2025 with more than $6 billion in assets, about ⅓ from WPT, up from zero WPT 18 months ago.  Most important, Longtail has delivered 20% annualized ROE since inception in 2020, 16%/year higher than the average of the top three global reinsurers, our aspirational peer group in the decades ahead.\n\nLongtail may do its next legacy trade in two years, or five, or never. In recent pre-search research, we discovered a faded 1622 salvage account in Seville – aka PwC’s Annual Global Insurance Run-Off Survey – suggesting about $1 trillion of WPT may be out there, somewhere, buried in old reinsurance balance sheets. Our Bayesian training tells us about 97 out of 100 legacy treasure hunts would be for fool’s gold, but also that about $30 billion of real treasure awaits. I’m betting on Longtail’s Bayesian treasure hunters to find it.\n\nJust last year, The Atlantic wrote, “15 years into its existence, bitcoin has yet to demonstrate any serious use case.”vi\n\n87% of humans today – though definitely no one who edits articles at The Atlantic – were born into a monetary system without a reserve currency, and also without democracy, rule of law, or property rights. Simply put, the way The Atlantic editors use money is not the way most people on earth use money, whose savings technology is either collapsing paper notes, cattle, or sheet metal.\n\nSeething with financial privilege, The Atlantic editors might debate the relative merits of saving in NVDA vs. AMZN. How about, instead, cattle vs. sheet metal?\n\nIf bitcoin has no use case, perhaps The Atlantic editors should convert their entire life savings into Malawian Kwacha and see how it goes. In 2023, Malawi – generally considered a democratic country – chose a 44% overnight currency devaluation. And…it’s gone.vii If you don’t hold bitcoin, please step out of the line. This line is for people who have money. Not fiat credit.\n\nNo one got to vote on the inhuman cruelty of almost halving – overnight – the cumulative value of their entire life’s work. Instead, the criminal counterfeiters central bank forced The Atlantic editors 22 million humans to invest their life savings in unbacked pieces of paper with zero marginal production cost, turning them, ex-post, into 44% slaves. Nothing produced limitlessly and for free can ever, eventually, have value. Fiat is always and everywhere a ponzi phenomenon with seigniorage the State’s irresistibly silent Madoff-like pitch. Bitcoin, its kryptonite, will never take the meeting.\n\nStill no use case? Let’s try another one.\n\n“There isn’t a single goddamn thing that bitcoin can do for retail that Apple Pay doesn’t already do 10x better.”\n\n— The Atlantic editors bitcoin critic on Twitter (2019)\n\n“I CAN’T use Apple pay/PayPal/Visa/Master or anything like them.  \nI’m from Iran\nI CAN use bitcoin\nWhat do you have to say?!\"\n\n— Ziya Sadr, Iranian human rights activist subsequently jailed for freedom advocacy (recently released)\n\nThe critic issued a public apology.\n\nStill no use case? Before we try a final one, a Stoic parable about awe can provide some context:\n\nWhen we were very young, the world was an awe-inspiring place. Watch a three-year-old watch her dad fill up a castle-shaped bucket with wet sand at the beach. She is fascinated that her father would do such a thing, but when he inverts the bucket and carefully lifts it up – revealing a perfect sandcastle – the three-year-old is awestruck that such magic is possible and that her father has power to perform that magic.\n\nIf we meet that three-year-old ten years later, maybe she has 25% of the capacity for awe she had that day at the beach.\n\nAnd ten years after that, her capacity for awe might be down to 1% of its sandcastle level.viii\n\nIn one of the most moving days of my life, on December 10th in Oslo I got to attend the very intimate award ceremony for the Nobel Peace Prize. My battery capacity for awe recharged to 100%.\n\nMaría Corina Machado won for her decades-long commitment to freedom, democracy, and human dignity in Venezuela.  In 2023, with more than one-third of her country’s 30 million citizens having fled to survive – the largest refugee population in the world – Machado decided to run for President against the brutal dictator Maduro, her campaign the personification of ultimate bravery.\n\n“Traveling by road and dirt path across a country with gasoline shortages, daily blackouts, and collapsing communications,”ix  Machado risked her life just to campaign. On July 28, 2024, her supporters risked theirs just to vote. In a nationwide eruption of truth, Machado won in a landslide.x  The repressive Maduro regime ignored the results, clung to power illegally, and forced Machado into hiding.\n\nThey tried to bury us.\nThey didn’t know we were seeds.\n\nIn late 2024, from a secret location, Machado was interviewed by the Human Rights Foundation’s (HRF) Chief Strategy Officer, Alex Gladstein, saying,\n\n“The world knows of Chavez and Maduro's human rights abuses, but less about their violations of financial rights, turning a functional economy into a catastrophic financial crisis. In 2018, inflation reached 1.7 million percent. This financial repression rooted in state sponsored looting, theft, and money printing happened despite our vast natural resources.\n\nBeyond wrecking the currency, the regime weaponized financial systems against its people, freezing accounts, seizing assets, and cutting off services. Venezuelans found a lifeline in bitcoin during hyperinflation, using it to protect their wealth and to finance their escape. Today, bitcoin bypasses government-imposed exchange rates and thus helps many of our people. It has evolved from a humanitarian tool to a vital means of resistance. We are grateful for the lifeline bitcoin provides and look forward to embracing it in a new democratic Venezuela. We envision bitcoin becoming part of our national reserves, helping rebuild what the dictatorship stole. Before our gold reserves were plundered, Venezuela had wealthy financial reserves worldwide. We will restore those reserves and include bitcoin as a key component.\n\nUnlike bank wires, which the regime blocks, bitcoin donations cannot be seized. Let's use this technology to bring about the change Venezuela desperately needs.\n\nWe are determined to assert our sovereignty and transform Venezuela into an open, prosperous, and secure society, something that is only possible in a free nation.”\n\nWe await The Atlantic’s public apology.\n\nUpon news of her Nobel win, Machado began plotting her escape from hiding. She wanted to be in Oslo as a symbol for her people and the world. When it was time, Machado – in a wigged disguise and under the cover of dark – left her jungle hiding spot, evaded multiple regime checkpoints, took a tiny fishing boat through treacherous waters, and finally – miraculously – boarded a supporter’s private plane to make it to Oslo. It would be impossible to overstate the danger Machado faced to escape.\n\nAlmost immediately upon landing, at 3am local time – after hugging her family, or anyone, for the first time since she had gone into hiding 16 months earlier, and in the same clothes she began her now immensely historic day – Machado sat for an interview with BBC News.xi\n\nI immediately noticed she sounded different.\n\nAlready the world’s most inspirational living human rights activist, some transcendent combination of her time in hiding, winning the Nobel, and successful escape gave Machado’s tone, timbre, and bearing a Mandela-like ascendence and regality. She spoke with extraordinary moral authority and absolute certainty about future events, words coming through her with divine clarity, Machado now destined to become among the greatest female leaders of all time.\n\n“Venezuela has turned into a nation in which the state applies terrorism. The regime has control of all institutions and has applied state terrorism towards innocent people and committed crimes against humanity. And everybody that dares to speak out, to defend any of your basic rights, takes a huge risk and probably ends in prison. Just for posting news about the Nobel Prize, you will get in prison. And if they go looking for you and they don't find you in your house, they will take your family, even children in prison.\n\nSo, they had to say that I'm a terrorist, that I have to be in jail for the rest of my life, and they're looking for me. So, certainly, leaving Venezuela today in these circumstances is very, very dangerous. So, I just want to say today that I'm here, because many men and women risked their lives in order for me to arrive in Oslo. And I came here on behalf of them, and the millions of anonymous Venezuelan heroes to receive the prize and to take it back to them, because it's theirs.\n\nI'm going back to Venezuela. The Venezuelan government would have disappeared me if they found me when I was in Venezuela. And I know exactly the risks I'm taking. And what I've said to the Venezuelan people from the beginning is I'm going to be in the place where I am more useful for our cause. And until very short time ago, the place where I thought I had to be was Venezuela. The place where I believe I have to be today on behalf of our cause is Oslo.”\n\nIn his 1978 essay The Power of the Powerless, human rights activist Václav Havel – leader of the Velvet Revolution, first President of the post-Communist Czech Republic, and HRF’s first Chairman – makes the searing point that though authoritarians can mobilize their heavy artillery of terror, torture, imprisonment, and persecution, they are not equipped to fight the asymmetric battle between lies and truth.\n\nVenezuelan regime change can also be an asymmetric truth domino – the animating spark for revolutionary excitement, heroism, and power among the powerless – that then topples the other nearby dictators in Cuba and Nicaragua. That cumulative outcome would be of immense significance to America, and that possibility has been hugely motivational to me. For American global primacy to continue, which it must, this must be the Western Hemisphere’s century. No authoritarians allowed in the neighborhood.\n\nThe majority of my personal philanthropy is anonymous, and it will stay that way. However, in the hope of inspiring followershipxii  at this moment of maximum human rights gamma, I will share that I have long supported Alex Gladstein’s work arming the only people dictators fear – human rights activists – with large quantities of Satoshi’s unstoppable truth-telling weapon. Bitcoin is money dictators can’t stop. I know firsthand its importance to HRF.\n\nAsleep during Machado’s BBC News interview, I left Oslo a few hours later, hustling back to New York to host the Stone Ridge holiday party that evening. After landing, I saw, and then listened to, a voicenote attached to an encrypted message. Mouth agape, I recognized the voice immediately. With an ascendence and regality that moved me to tears by the end, here is the message in full:\n\nI want to thank you personally for your support of the Human Rights Foundation and all the programs that have made possible this unique moment in Oslo this week.\n\nBecause of your support I was able to move, to arrive where I needed to be and to continue to fight without interruption. You know in moments like these, logistics are the whole difference between presence and absence.\n\nI arrived late and I didn’t have a chance to thank you in person as I wanted, or to tell you about the plans we have in the time to come, but I know that we will have a chance to do that very soon. I want you to know that your personal commitment to our struggle for freedom translates directly into action.\n\nIt gives our people and people like us the ability to stand where it matters and when it matters so I am very, very grateful for your clarity of purpose, for your belief in freedom and certainly for your willingness to stand for this freedom in both practice and principle.\n\nI will not cease in this struggle for freedom, and I certainly look forward to welcoming you and hosting you and your family in our beautiful country and a free Venezuela.\n\nThank you for making so much happen. I look forward to seeing you and please take very good care.”\n\nBitcoin has a use case.  Human rights treasure.\n\nAnd with Machado walking among us, we need not live life devoid of feelings of awe.\n\nIn 1984 Apple, then still Apple Computer, premiered a sci-fi short film – a commercial at the Super Bowl – in which a rebellious heroine smashes a screen, symbolizing Apple breaking free from the conformity of IBM’s Big Brother. Widely considered the greatest commercial of all-time for almost four decades, it established Apple’s identity, paved the way for the Mac, and led to record sales.\n\nIn 2020, also at the Super Bowl, Apple was dethroned. New York Life premiered an even better commercial paving the way for the next chapter of its identity, also leading to record sales. Over the course of 60 emotional seconds, New York Life began by briefly exploring three Greek words for love (Philia, Storgē, Eros) to then focus on the fourth, Agape, or love as an action. The ad contained powerful scenes of care, including a ten-year-old boy lifting his little brother over a country fence en route to adventure, and a 50-year-old son lowering his frail 95-year-old father into a tub to help him bathe. The commercial anchored the firm’s 175th anniversary branding of building better futures through love and financial security.\n\nThe ancient Greeks had four words for love. The first is Philia. Philia is affection that grows from friendship. Next there’s Storgē, the kind you have for a grandparent. Or a brother. Third, there’s Eros, the uncontrollable urge to say, “I love you.” The fourth kind of love is different. It’s the most admirable. It’s called Agape: love as an action. It takes courage, sacrifice, strength; for 175 years we’ve been helping people act on their love so they can look back – or ahead – and say, “We got it right. We did good.”\n\nStone Ridge takes immense pride in working for the policyholders of New York Life, and also MassMutual, iconic American firms and our largest partners, 180-years-old and 174-years-old, respectively. Mutuals are special. They feel different inside. There is no conflict of interest between the shareholders and the policyholders because there are no shareholders. The policyholders own the firm, a wonderfully clarifying and palpable distinction. Employees stay for decades, and the top executives view themselves, appropriately and inspirationally to me, as leaders and stewards. My Stone Ridge colleagues and I run to work every day for New York Life and MassMutual. And we aspire for our little firm to be like those big guys when we grow up.\n\nSince any company’s longevity, on a long enough timescale, is entirely dependent on its ability to reinvent itself, the most underappreciated characteristic of these mutuals is their astonishing consistency of innovation. The typical firm in the S&P 500 is 58 years old, not 180. No business can do tomorrow what it did yesterday and last very long, let alone do in the next century what it did in the last.\n\nConsider that these mutuals paid claims during the Civil War when – remember, their core product is life insurance – their policyholders were shooting each other. They paid claims after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, decades before Hannover Re-quality earthquake seismologists could help them properly underwrite that risk. And they paid claims through the two global pandemics, twice surviving life insurers’ one true tail risk.\n\nExtraordinary financial strength, ironclad reliable claims payment, and a monumentally underrated culture of innovation = New York Life and MassMutual.\n\nWatching these reinventing mutuals up close has also taught me that firms seeking longevity – including Stone Ridge – must, just as importantly, decide what must not change. What is our air-gapped mission? What are the rituals we dare not cease?  What routines – the ones that make us us – shall we pass to new colleagues? In essence, what are we stewards of?\n\n“In order to be irreplaceable, one must always be different.”\n\n— Coco Chanel, revolutionary fashion designer\n\nAt Stone Ridge, we innovate to prepare for an uncertain future, in pursuit of our mission: financial security for all. Our rituals are few, important, and sacrosanct. Our routines drive our productivity.\n\nWe work five days/week in office and have a “no-device” policy in meetings, routines that maximize exposure to the uncorrelated weirdness of our spectacular coleagues. Fiddling with a device in a meeting means you do not belong in that meeting. Meetings should be rare, riveting, and short. Zero is the wrong number of meetings for a firm, but it is close. A meeting-less firm with 100 employees has 4,950 potential 1:1 colleague-collisions all day long. Remove 10% of the team for an unnecessary meeting and lose 945 potential collisions. That meeting-math is especially punishing at Stone Ridge. Our people are our moat, dug deeper per collision.\n\n“A lot of people never use their initiative because no one told them to.”\n\nInitiating collisions with insanely smart colleagues at Stone Ridge can seem intimidating at first, but you must take the initiative to ever create a map in which X marks the spot. My advice to my colleagues is the same advice I give to my 18- and 23-year-old boys.  Ask her out. Whether “she” is a hard class, a job, a city, a beautiful woman, or a brilliant Stone Ridge colleague – just go up and talk.xiv And remember, Stone Ridge colleagues are insanely kind too.\n\nAt Stone Ridge, we care deeply about how we present ourselves to outsiders because we matter, and so do they. When introducing ourselves in meetings, we mention our role and how long we have been at the firm. “Hi, I’m Ross Stevens, the CEO, and I’ve been at Stone Ridge since 2012.” After meetings, we walk our guests to the elevator, along the way sincerely thanking them for the visit. Sometimes we even take the elevator down with them so we can thank them some more. Finally, business cards are back. Business cards remind us we live in a tactile world, and our most tactile experiences are with other humans. Business cards also symbolize something of value – you. Our simple meeting routines honor ourselves and our firm and show proper respect to our visitors.\n\n“Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.”\n\nOver the last 36 months, three Stone Ridge colleagues voluntarily left to work at another firm. Each was junior in their career and had a ten-month average tenure with us. Clearly, Stone Ridge was not for them. We, in turn, reflected on what happened in each instance and refined our recruiting process, uninterested in transience in any element of our life’s work. Though Stone Ridge achieved, with plenty of room to spare, my singular KPI – less than 1%/year voluntary turnover – those three departures were exactly three too many to me. I intend to raise my game in 2026, so please tune in – same Bat-Time, same Bat-Channel – to see if I had a better year.\n\n“I need someone to protect me from all the measures they take in order to protect me.”\n\nDespite the three leavers, Stone Ridge got something very important, very right at firm inception: no HR. No HR is the gift that keeps on giving because the very best people are repelled by those addicted to comfort. When new folks arrive at Stone Ridge and realize we have no HR, a lens cap lifts off their consciousness. Surrounded by elite intellectual athletes, they immediately begin their training to be one, feeling compelled to do remarkable things, utterly untethered to what they previously thought possible. We teach them business physics, but also to feel bound by nothing. I would not dare limit their leaps even one inch with even one minute of an infantilizing HR training session.\n\n“He is no longer a dreamer.  He is a creator.”\n\n— Sculptor Auguste Rodin, describing his masterpiece The Thinker\n\nOne of my favorite untethered Stone Ridge policies is unlimited maternity leave, which has been true since the firm began. I think of Agape. It takes care and action to properly delegate your duties to your remaining colleagues while you enjoy that magical time with your family. In action and a bit of love, your colleagues lock arms and step up for you, so the firm does not miss a beat in your absence, the duration of which I refuse to meter. It also takes action and a bit of love to take no action. The awesome women of Stone Ridge know their job will be waiting for them when they get back. I sometimes wonder if that ever helps them decide to create more treasure.\n\n“It is fun to have fun, but you have to know how.”\n\n— Philosopher The Cat, on his approach to work in his masterpiece The Cat in the Hat\n\nAt Stone Ridge, we relentlessly focus on growing after-tax cash flow to drive durable equity value in our operating businesses. Our progress has never resembled a straight line up and to the right, and I hope it never does. However, thinking deeply about what we know before we know, open-mindedness to – and hunger for – new data, and extremely rapid posterior updating – and ultimately the courage to create with conviction when we believe it is time – have been the hallmarks of our operating model since firm inception.\n\nThe first rule of product design at Stone Ridge is we build products we want for ourselves. Stone Ridge is always the seed investor and, whenever possible – but not yet always – the largest. Consider our “no-device” policy in this context. Would you ever pull out your phone and start scrolling in the middle of a meeting with your largest investor? At Stone Ridge, we do not pull our phones out on each other.\n\nWith Stone Ridge increasingly Stone Ridge’s largest investor, the scale of our profits as principals, not agents, creates a level of alignment with our outside investors we are unaware exists elsewhere. Those investors occasionally remark that this is a wonderfully clarifying and palpable distinction, and that Stone Ridge feels different inside.\n\nEarlier this year, Stone Ridge Holdings Group (SRHG), parent company of Stone Ridge Asset Management, NYDIG, and Longtail Re, completed a significant primary equity financing led by an iconic American financial services firm – also a mutual, though this one a relatively spry 165-year-old – we are thrilled to partner with in the decades ahead.\n\nDespite regularly rising profitability, regularly raising primary equity for our parent and affiliates – $4.6 billion and counting, and only primary, ever – has been our quiet way of strengthening our most important partnerships, playing muscular defense when the sky falls in our markets, and playing profitable post-event offense in the aftermath.\n\nFounding 2012 SRHG investors have received 32x their original investment in distributions and now own equity valued up 178x net of those distributions, an annualized total return of 50%.  Fisher took 5,954 days to find the Atocha. We have been at it for 4,930. Every morning, I bang our little ship’s pots and pans with a smile because I know Stone Ridge will find the treasure.\n\nAs we enter 2026, our tanks are filled with energy, gratitude, and inspiration. We innovate to prepare for an uncertain future, in pursuit of our mission: financial security for all.\n\nStone Ridge is most proud of the partnership we have with you, our investors. We are on the path together. You contribute the capital to propel and sustain groundbreaking product development. We contribute our collective careers’ worth of experience in sourcing, structuring, execution, and risk management. Together, it works. In that spirit, I offer my deepest gratitude to you for sharing your wealth with us this year. We look forward to serving you again in 2026.",

    "fullText": "From Zendaya to zoomers, listeners are forgoing the convenience of wireless headphones to plug in again. Is it just a retro affectation – or does this physical connection strengthen our relationship to music?\n\nAirPods changed my life. I was previously a user of excellent but somewhat cumbersome Audio Technica over-ears, but Apple’s wireless headphones – dinky in their construction, finicky in their setup, temperamental in their ability to actually work – liberated me from cords. My listening habits are, at best, frustrating for the people around me: when you write about music, you have to listen to the same things over and over, and sometimes those things are very bad. Suddenly I could listen to a terrible new pop record or an ominous drone piece while making breakfast or folding laundry late at night without fear of disturbing my housemates by listening from a speaker. I kept my Audio Technicas but built out my collection of AirPods; now I use the wireless in-ear ones while commuting and also have the over-ear AirPods Max.\n\nFor a while, though, I’ve been thinking about moving back to wired earbuds. At some point, doubts about the joyous wireless future I was living in began to creep into my head. I am conspiracy-prone, and started to wonder what all that Bluetooth was doing to my head. I thought about the security issues that come with Bluetooth. And after a fall from a Lime bike on a slippery road, I started thinking about ways to avoid all future falls, one of which was to cycle without listening to music or podcasts.\n\nMost of all, I wondered whether my ability to listen to music constantly was making me value it less. When you have to listen to music occupationally, your standards necessarily get higher – a lot of music really is quite samey – but is my ability to listen on my minute-long walk to check the mail really beneficial, or is it simply turning art into ambient noise? And that is to say nothing of the way wireless headphones seem to turn communal spaces such as cafes and sidewalks into thoroughfares for individuals. These problems theoretically exist for users of wired headphones too, but I can’t say I ever considered headphones antisocial or anti-art until AirPods came along.\n\nI’m clearly not the only one. I see more and more people, especially people around my age, rocking the classic white iPod-associated earbuds instead of the previously ubiquitous AirPods. Celebrities and politicians such as Bella Hadid, Zendaya, Dua Lipa and Kamala Harris use them, as do a lot of musicians I know. When New York magazine published its annual Reasons to Love New York issue last week, it featured stars such as Debbie Harry, Cameron Winter and Subway Takes host Kareem Rahma sharing wired earbuds on the cover, because photographer Hannah la Follette Ryan had noticed more and more people listening to music that way on the subway. You see the same casual intimacy on the tube in London and on buses. The other day I even saw a teenager recreating the ultimate symbol of cool of my youth: two white earbuds dangling from the inside of his collar.\n\nAlthough there is undeniably some swaggy retro appeal in wearing wired headphones – especially dinky white ones, which allow Gorillaz-loving zoomers, of whom there are many, to relive the era of the Feel Good Inc-soundtracked iPod ad – I think the return to cords was likely born out of a desire for simplicity and economy. The facts of being young right now – just of being alive right now – are that wages have stagnated as prices have gotten higher and rent has become exorbitant. AirPods cost £99, wired Apple headphones are £17: the moment you lose an AirPod – or, as once happened to me, drop one as you leave a bus and look on in horror as the bus slowly rolls over it – you realise that they are emphatically a luxury product, not the everyday essential they may have seemed when you were using them to tune out a rowdy toddler on said bus. As with streaming, or TikTok, or next-day delivery, luxuries we’ve had access to for only a few years can seem indispensable when there’s actually evidence to suggest the world functioned a whole lot better before we had all these things.\n\nThat wired headphones are experiencing a resurgence is heartening – it may be a bellwether for a society ready and willing to slowly divest from all the crutches it uses every day. (I hope ChatGPT is next.) On the other hand, it could mean nothing except that 18-year-olds have just discovered the aura-increasing capabilities of white rubber-coated wire and PVC. Either way, I am ready for our corded future. When I go Christmas shopping this week, I certainly know what Shaad is getting.",

    "fullText": "Mass protests have erupted across Iran calling for “death to the dictator” over the regime’s economic crisis.\n\nTear gas was used to disperse protesters as shops shuttered in Tehran’s Grand Bazaar and main markets.\n\nUniversity students called on their peers to join the demonstrations, while chants echoed from rooftops in several cities and the Iranian rial plunged to record lows, all against the backdrop of ongoing threats from Israel and the US.\n\nResidents in one city near Tehran told The Telegraph that a heavy presence of armed motorcycle-mounted security forces was visible around midnight.\n\nOn Monday, security forces fired tear gas to disperse protesters in Tehran while residents in Malard, 28 miles east of the capital, were faced with motorcycle-mounted armed security.\n\nIn several cities, people went on to their rooftops and chanted slogans against the Islamic Republic and Ali Khamenei, its supreme leader.\n\nThe protests have been cheered on by Israel, whose foreign ministry hoping for Mr Khamenei’s overthrow welcomed the action with “open arms”.\n\nDonald Trump also threatened military action on Monday if Iran rebuilds its nuclear or missile programmes, warning he will “knock the hell out of them”.\n\nAt several universities, students urged their peers to join demonstrations after protests erupted at Tehran University’s dormitory complex.\n\nSecurity forces surrounded the dormitory on Monday evening and closed its gates with a heavy security presence around the campus.\n\nStudents living at the complex chanted slogans including “Woman, life, freedom”, “Students die but do not accept humiliation” and “Be afraid, be afraid, we are all together”.\n\nOne student inside the dormitory said: “They have closed the gates, and special forces on motorcycles are circling us. We are determined – some of us may be arrested, things could get worse – but we will not back down.”\n\nIranian universities have long been hubs of political activism, with students playing key roles in protests for decades.\n\nAhmadreza, a university student in Malard, told The Telegraph: “They [the protesters] have closed roads in several neighbourhoods, and chants are coming from all directions. People are also chanting from their rooftops.\n\n“It’s almost impossible to move from one part of the city to another. There are police cars with cages. People are angry and exhausted as prices rise day by day.”\n\nThe protests began on Sunday afternoon after mobile phone and electronics shopkeepers in Tehran shut their stores as the rial currency fell to a record low of 1.42 million to the dollar.\n\nRiot police in full gear confronted hundreds of demonstrators near Tehran’s Grand Bazaar and in the Saadi Street area on Monday afternoon.\n\nTraders shut their shops and urged others to join the closures. Security forces maintained a heavy presence at multiple locations throughout the capital.\n\nThe currency recovered slightly to 1.38 million on Monday evening after the Islamic Republic’s central bank governor resigned but remains down approximately 40 per cent since June.\n\nIran’s currency collapse is compounding severe inflation. The state statistics centre reported inflation reached 42.2 per cent in December, up 1.8 percentage points from November.\n\nFood prices surged 72 per cent, and health and medical items rose 50 per cent compared to the same period last year.\n\nMasoud Pezeshkian, Iran’s president, said on Sunday in the parliament: “I have no motivation to remain in government or to remain president if I cannot solve the problems of the people and the deprived.\n\n“This is not something I want to be proud of. We cannot govern while people have problems … they say salaries are low, so they are low, they say you are taking too much in taxes, so we are taking too much tax.\n\n“On the other side, they say increase salaries. Someone tell me where I should get the money from to give?”\n\nMr Pezeshkian addressed the protests directly on Monday night after the demonstrations spread, saying he will listen to the protesters’ demands.\n\nHe said: “We have fundamental measures on the agenda to reform the monetary and banking system and preserve people’s purchasing power.\n\n“I have tasked the interior minister to listen to the rightful demands of the protesters through dialogue with their representatives, so that the government can act with full effort to resolve problems and respond responsibly.”\n\nThe rial was trading at 32,000 to the dollar in 2015 when Iran signed a nuclear accord with world powers that lifted international sanctions.\n\nThat agreement collapsed after Mr Trump withdrew the United States from it in 2018.\n\nThe deal completely collapsed in October and followed by the reimposition of UN sanctions that were lifted as part of the deal.\n\nIran last experienced nationwide protests in 2022 and 2023 after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody.\n\nHundreds of people were killed, more than 20,000 arrested, and several executed in connection with those demonstrations.\n\nState media acknowledged Monday’s protests but said that shopkeepers were concerned only about economic conditions.\n\nState media reporters on the main 20:30 news programme sought to portray the protests as economic rather than anti-regime, showing scenes of normality on the streets and interviewing residents.\n\nOne resident said: “Please end this – end this. The price of the dollar is nonsense.”\n\nAnother shopkeeper said: “If we sell something today, we can’t buy it again at the same price tomorrow. The government should think about the situation.”\n\nThe government’s IRNA news agency reported that mobile phone vendors were reacting to business threats from the currency’s depreciation.\n\nIran also raised petrol prices this month, triggering warnings from lawmakers about a potential repeat of violent 2019 fuel protests that killed hundreds in what was then the deadliest unrest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.\n\nMostafa Tajzadeh, the imprisoned Iranian politician and prominent dissident, said: “Now the time has come for all those who want a prosperous, free, and independent Iran to speak with one voice and call for the separation of religious institutions from political institutions, for the clergy to hand power back to the people, and to return to their traditional base in the seminaries.\n\n“The safest and most reliable way out of the crises is to convene a constituent assembly and amend the constitution in line with the will of the nation.”\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "description": "Researchers remain stumped.",
    "fullText": "Researchers have found wolves engaging in rudimentary tool use, according to PetaPixel.\n\nTrail camera footage has captured wolves pulling crab traps out of the water to eat the bait inside. Members of the Heiltsuk First Nation have been attempting to capture invasive European green crabs near Bella Bella, British Columbia. Their traps were being routinely found ripped open, so researchers set up cameras.\n\nThere's some debate as to whether this counts as actual tool use since the wolves didn't put out the traps themselves. But it is still a remarkable sign of wildlife intelligence.\n\n\"Even if we don't want to call it tool use, the fact that the trap was completely underwater and out of sight makes it hard to argue that she didn't understand the connection between all these steps,\" said report author Kyle Artelle, per The New York Times. \"This wasn't just random tinkering.\"\n\nWhile interesting, this situation shows how humans introducing food incentives to areas can warp natural feeding habits. The erosion of habitat can diminish feeding opportunities for wildlife, forcing it to scour farther afield to survive. This can lead to animals roaming areas populated by people.\n\nWolves are vital parts of Canada's ecosystems. As apex predators, they help keep prey species populations in check, which ensures that plant species aren't overgrazed. Wolf populations have been in decline in some areas of the Pacific Northwest despite management efforts.\n\nThat said, wolf interference with attempts to remove European green crabs may further harm local ecosystems. When invasive species take over, they monopolize vital resources like food, water, and space, causing a local decline in biodiversity.\n\nEuropean green crabs pose a threat to salmon, clams, and other crab species that fishery industries rely upon. Some jurisdictions have had to make concerted removal efforts. These include initiatives to eat more of the invasive species.\n\nTrail cameras have proven vital in detecting emerging behaviors from elusive and remote wildlife like wolves in this situation. Armed with new information, conservation efforts can be appropriately adjusted. That said, researchers remain stumped as to why or how the wolves figured out how to exploit crab traps for food.\n\n\"We ultimately don't know, but [one of the] most likely explanations in our minds … would be that the wolves started doing this with traps that were exposed at a low tide because that's really easy,\" Artelle said to the CBC.\n\nDo you think we still have a lot to learn from ancient cultures?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Known as a kore, this 2,500 year-old-statue is a fusion of ancient aesthetics and a symbol of cultural exchange between the Greeks and the Etruscans.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nRecent excavations in the ancient Etruscan city of Vulci revealed the head of a marble statue that appears to have Greek influence.\n\nThe head belongs to a kore, statues made in the images of young women which stood in and around the temples of Greece at the time.\n\nThought to have been associated with a temple in Vulci, this artifact is a rare glimpse at larger Etruscan objects inspired by cultural exchange with the Greeks of Attica.\n\nAt an archaeological site in what used to be the ancient Etruscan city of Vulci, the disembodied head of a young woman began to emerge from the ground, her empty eyes staring through millennia of history. Her marble face had not seen daylight in 2,500 years.\n\nBefore the rise of the Roman Empire, the Etruscan civilization flourished in the western region of central Italy once known as Etruria. Vulci was situated northwest of Rome in what is now the province of Viterbo. As directors of the Vulci Cityscape project, archaeologists Mariachiara Franceschini of the Albert Ludwig University of Freiburg and Pau Pasieka of Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz were excavating the ruins of this once prosperous ancient metropolis. It was there that they came upon the marble head of a statue mirroring the Greek korai found near the Parthenon in the Athenian Acropolis. It was a rare glimpse into a larger sculpture that shows the extent of Greek influence on Etruscan art and culture.\n\nThe face of the nameless woman most likely gazed out from a monumental temple that was discovered in 2020 near Tempio Grande. She had once had a decorative and possibly ritual purpose. With an eerily lifelike smile, she wears a diadem over a crown of hair that has been meticulously carved down to every strand, and while the paint that once brought her to life has long since eroded, she was preserved so well that traces of original paint can still be seen on the marble. While it used to be thought that most of the cultural exchange between Etruria and the Attica region of Greece (also famous for its honey) was evidenced in the form of painted pottery, the head of this kore shows that Hellenic influence reached beyond clay vessels.\n\nWhoever commissioned this statue must have been one of the Etruscan elite. Marble was an expensive material usually reserved for the religious or funerary art of the upper classes, and the quality of the craftsmanship can still be seen thousands of years later. This level of detail extends to the texture of the kore’s hair—its flowing waves are reminiscent of similar Hellenic statues. She is one of the few pieces in this style found outside of Greece. Most previous Etruscan excavations have focused on tombs and necropolis complexes without much investigation of everyday urban life. Unlike the broken columns of ancient Greek and Roman cities that are still standing, no buildings survive in that area. Only their foundations remain.\n\nThis kore is now being restored at Rome’s Instituto Centrale per il Restauro. Though it is not certain whether she was made for the temple she is now being associated with, that temple rose between the end of the sixth and the beginning of the fifth century B.C.E. It was also built the same time as another temple that was excavated during the 1950s and dated based on artifacts that were unearthed around its foundations. Crumbling sections of wall made of volcanic rock gave more insight into how the architecture of Vulci evolved over a thousand years of serving as the heart of Etruscan society.\n\n“We discovered remains from the city’s origins that had previously been overlooked in Vulci and are now better able to understand the dynamics of settlement and the road system, besides identifying different functional areas in the city,” Pasieka said in a press release about the discovery of the temple.\n\nAnother impressive Etruscan object with Hellenized features is a massive bronze lamp whose symbolism was a mystery for decades. Its images of forest nymphs and satyrs were finally determined to be revelers of Dionysus, the Greek deity of wine, fertility, ecstasy, mysticism and theatre, who appears as a horned god in ornamental figures that surround them.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "HOLBROOK, Ariz. (AP) — Investigators declined to reveal the suspected motive in the shooting death of a prominent California farmer’s estranged wife in eastern Arizona, but they said the couple's prolonged divorce case arose in nearly all interviews with family and friends.\n\nMichael Abatti, 63, was arrested last week in El Centro, California, in the shooting death of Kerri Ann Abatti, 59, at her family’s vacation home in Pinetop, Arizona, where she moved after splitting with her husband.\n\nInvestigators, who discussed the case at a news conference Monday, say Michael Abatti traveled from El Centro to Pinetop on Nov. 20, carried out the killing and returned to California early the next morning. They declined to say what occurred at the Pinetop house in the last days of Kerri Abatti’s life.\n\n“Different theories will come up,” Navajo County Sheriff David Clouse said of the motive. “The only thing that’s glaring that I think everybody already knows is there’s a divorce in place and they weren’t able to come to a resolution. But I can’t speak exactly to what the motive would be.”\n\nOwen Roth, one of Michael Abatti’s attorneys, said his client surrendered to law enforcement, agreed to be extradited to Arizona and remains innocent under the law. “Our client is in his mid-60s and has significant health issues, and we continue to worry about his well-being,” Roth said. “We ask the public to respect his privacy and constitutional rights and reiterate that this case will be decided based on the evidence by a jury.” An autopsy report released Monday said Kerri Abatti’s cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head.\n\nThe report said she was found unconscious on the floor near her kitchen by her nephew, who told investigators he heard a loud sound before finding her. When investigators searched the home they found a “circular defect” on a window and determined “a gunshot likely originated from the yard outside the home,” the autopsy report said.\n\nThe Associated Press left a message for the Navajo County Sheriff’s Office for further explanation. The medical examiner’s office in Coconino County, which conducted the autopsy, directed questions about the report to a Navajo County official, and the AP also left a message for the official. A descendant of early Latter-day Saints settlers who helped found Pinetop in the 1880s, Kerri had filed for divorce, with proceedings pending in California at the time of her death.\n\nAuthorities searched his home in far Southern California on Dec. 2 as part of the investigation into his wife’s death.\n\nMichael Abatti comes from a long line of farmers in the crop-rich Imperial Valley, which is the biggest user of Colorado River water and known for growing leafy greens, melons and forage crops. His grandfather, an Italian immigrant, was among the region’s early settlers and his father helped start the Imperial Valley Vegetable Growers Association.\n\nMichael Abatti served on the board of the powerful Imperial Irrigation District from 2006 to 2010.\n\nThe Abattis, who married in 1992 and had three children, were sparring over finances. Kerri told the court the couple had lived an affluent lifestyle during more than three decades of marriage. They owned property in three states, vacationed internationally and sent their children to private school.\n\nKerri initially received $5,000 monthly temporary spousal support. She later sought an increase, citing struggles to maintain her standard of living as well as keep up the Arizona property. She also asked for an additional $100,000 in attorney’s fees, court filings showed.\n\nMichael Abatti eventually agreed to raise support to $6,400 monthly, despite having countered in a court filing that poor farming years had reduced his income. He blamed market shifts favoring Ukrainian crops, rising shipping costs and harsh weather.",

    "description": "Why the old formula is no longer holding up.",
    "fullText": "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nFor decades, the classic 60/40 portfolio — 60% stocks and 40% bonds — served as the cornerstone of balanced investing. The idea was simple: When stocks stumbled, bonds would steady the ship.\n\nBut according to economist Peter Schiff, that old formula no longer holds up. Inflation, he warns, has torn apart one side of the traditional mix, leaving investors exposed to painful consequences.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nApproaching retirement with no savings? Don’t panic, you're not alone. Here are 6 easy ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\n“Bonds are clearly the biggest victims of inflation. If you own bonds, inflation kills you. There is no hedge,” Schiff said in a YouTube video from October 2025 (1).\n\nBut, on Dec. 22, Wells Fargo reported that the yield on 10-year bonds increased 0.03% while 30-year bonds saw a 0.02% uptick (2). This follows the BLS reporting lower inflation rates than expected on Dec. 18, in their first report on the Consumer Price Index since the government shutdown in October and November (3).\n\nBonds are particularly vulnerable when price levels rise. Their fixed payments don’t adjust for inflation, meaning investors are repaid in dollars that buy less and less over time.\n\nMeanwhile, higher inflation often pushes interest rates up — and as rates rise, the market value of existing bonds falls because new issues offer better yields. That double blow — shrinking purchasing power and falling prices — can leave existing bondholders with real losses even as they collect “safe” interest payments.\n\nThat’s a serious concern because bonds remain a core holding in many Americans’ portfolios, especially retirement accounts. For retirees and near-retirees counting on those holdings to preserve purchasing power, inflation can quietly erode wealth — even when markets appear calm. If inflation spikes again, many Americans could see their portfolios become compromised.\n\nTo address that problem, a major Wall Street firm is giving the traditional 60/40 mix a modern upgrade.\n\nSchiff pointed out that Morgan Stanley is leading the rethink. Instead of 60% stocks and 40% bonds, Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson now favors 60% stocks, 20% fixed income and 20% gold.",

    "fullText": "\"Then, about two months before my diagnosis, I started experiencing severe lower back pain and pelvic cramps. That is what ultimately led me to my ob-gyn. It was a tricky diagnosis. Even a biopsy did not indicate cancer, but the doctor decided to perform a D&C as an extra measure, and that is how the cancer was found. Surgery and radiation were the treatment plans. That was three years ago. I just had a PET SCAN, which showed I am now cancer-free, but I remain under surveillance for two more years.\"\n\n\"'Before I tell him to quit, I'd like to get your opinion,' she said. 'Let’s go into the bathroom. I want to show you something.'\n\nThis wasn't something I expected or anticipated. She lowered her pants and had me look just above her buttocks. There was a three-inch growth that resembled a worm. It was large, thick, and angry-looking.\n\n'Don't let him quit his job yet,' I said. 'You need a doctor first. Do it while you still have insurance.'\n\n'That's way above my pay grade,' I said. I'm not medical in any way, shape, or form.'\n\nThe next week, she saw her primary care doctor, who turned her over to a specialist, which kind, I don't know.\n\n'Thanks for telling me to see the doctor,' she said. 'He’s going to hang in until we get to the bottom of this.'\n\nMy friend had anal cancer. Because she wanted to handle her healing herself, she went with a natural approach and ate only things with no mothers and no faces and watched only old screwball comedies on TV. In three years, she went from an 85% survival rate to terminal. By the time she went back to a 'normal’ doctor, she was inoperable and in tremendous pain. Hospice wouldn't provide her with enough pain medication to control her pain. It was a horrible death.\n\nIn a nutshell, noticing something unusual needs to be investigated. Only you really know your body; keep looking for answers.\"\n\n\"Today, I'm a six-year ovarian cancer survivor because it was detected early, aggressive treatment was started immediately, and I had the support of my family and an incredible medical team. (My oncologist is Dr. Hope! Isn't that the best possible name?)\"\n\n\"Five years later, I had another diagnosis of cancer, but it was caught early, and it was stage one. I didn't feel that one — it was found on a mammogram. But months before, I felt extremely tired and had trouble staying awake during the day. I always wondered if that was a sign that something wasn't right with my body. The tiredness got better once my treatments were finished. Who knows. I am blessed to be here still, though!\"\n\n\"The strange part was that despite not being treated for the duration of my cancer treatment, the fungus infection healed up all by itself. That fungal infection was the only indication that I had a serious problem.\"\n\n\"December 2023 UPDATE: One year has passed. I had six months (12 infusions) of hard chemotherapy, and as of the end of September 2023, I was told that the cancer was in remission.\"\n\n\"But, four years after that cancer, I was diagnosed with very early ovarian cancer. It turns out colon/ovarian/ breast are related in some people. That cancer had no symptoms. It was found because I knew the connection between the three cancers and did aggressive follow-up. The doctor spotted an ovarian tumor so small that it couldn't be felt if he were to examine the ovary. Turns out my peritoneum was loaded with tiny tumors. Lesson: colon cancer w/symptoms saved my life. I never would have found the ovarian if I hadn't been doing serious follow-up. That cancer was 17 years ago.\"\n\nSome entries have been edited for length and/or clarity.\n\nAlso in Internet Finds: \"I Genuinely Believe She Saved My Life\": People Are Revealing The \"Shockingly Nice\" Things Strangers Have Done For Them That They'll Always Remember, And I'm Sitting Here In A Puddle Of Happy Tears\n\nAlso in Internet Finds: 19 People Are Sharing Eerie, Unexplainable Moments From Their Lives That Will 99.999% Make A Shiver Run Up Your Spine\n\nAlso in Internet Finds: 17 Actual Texting Conversations People Had With Potential Partners That'll Straight Up Put You Out",

(AP) — A Georgia judge on Monday ordered a temporary pause to a December execution that was already put on hold, saying questions about the state's clemency process must be addressed before Stacey Humphreys ' death sentence could be carried out.\n\nHumphreys, 52, was facing scheduled execution Dec. 17 but the procedure was paused just days before he was to have received a lethal injection.\n\nHe was convicted of malice murder and other crimes in the 2003 shooting deaths of Cyndi Williams, 33, and Lori Brown, 21, at the real estate office where they worked in Cobb County, northwest of Atlanta.\n\nAt issue: Humphreys' lawyers contend that two members of Georgia's parole board have conflicts of interest which would taint their participation in a clemency hearing.\n\nHumphreys’ lawyers earlier this month filed a petition asking a judge to order the two members of the parole board to recuse themselves from considering his clemency petition.\n\nThe lawyers said one of those board members, Kimberly McCoy, was previously a victim advocate with the Cobb County district attorney’s office at the time of Humphreys’ trial and was assigned to work with victims in the case.\n\nAnother board member, Wayne Bennett, was the sheriff in Glynn County, where the trial was moved because of pretrial publicity. Humphreys’ lawyers say Bennett oversaw security for the jurors and Humphreys himself during the case.\n\nIn an order filed Monday, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney wrote that “pressing ‘pause’ on the execution machinery until we answer the non-frivolous question raised by Petitioner concerning the proper composition of the Board for his clemency hearing is the correct course of action.”\n\nHe ordered lawyers for both sides to file additional legal briefs on the issue by Jan. 19.\n\nAdditionally, the judge wrote in his order that Humphreys deserves to have the conflict of interest question researched and argued thoroughly so that a parole board free of conflicts of interest can decide his case at a clemency hearing.",

    "fullText": "AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson\n\nThe concerning stories about President Donald Trump’s health aren’t going away anytime soon, especially if Drudge Report has anything to say (or aggregate) about it.\n\nThe president has been occasionally seen in public with a bruised hand in recent months, but recently he has appeared with two bruised hands.\n\nOn Sunday, the president welcomed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to Mar-a-Lago, and Trump appeared to be wearing different colors of concealer on each hand.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt insisted that the discoloration on Trump’s right hand is due to handshakes.\n\n“President Trump is a man of the people and he meets more Americans and shakes their hands on a daily basis than any other President in history. His commitment is unwavering and he proves that every single day,” Leavitt told The Daily Beast for an article titled, “Trump’s Bruises Spread in Blow to Leavitt’s Handshake Claim.” The press secretary did not explain the discoloration on the president’s left hand.\n\nIn another post, the U.K.’s Express highlighted the concerns some on social media aired, including that of liberal poster Aaron Rupar, who wrote, “There appears to be a hole in Trump’s left hand.”\n\nOn Monday night, Drudge Report brought the issue to the fore with links to the stories, the lines “BRUISES SPREAD” and “‘HOLE IN HAND,'” as well as an image of Trump’s hands, the size of which he defended in 2016.\n\n“I have to say this, he hit my hands,” Trump, then a first-time presidential candidate, said of an attack from opponent Marco Rubio. “Nobody has ever hit my hands. I’ve never heard of this one. Look at those hands. Are they small hands? And he referred to my hands if they’re small, something else must be small.\n\nTrump added, “I guarantee you there’s no problem. I guarantee you.”\n\nDuring recent public appearances, the president has been seen covering his right hand with his left hand and sometimes a bandage.\n\nThe post ‘Bruises Spread’: Drudge Report Highlights Alarming Stories on Trump’s ‘Hole in Hand’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Iraq’s decision to introduce the Ja’fari law in January means that girls can be married based on perceived “maturity and physical capacity.”\n\nBaghdad’s bridal industry has seen a massive boom since Iraq legalized child marriage, and human rights organizations have warned that young girls are being auctioned off in black market sales to older men, a Sunday Times investigation revealed on Saturday.\n\nThe relatives of Amani, a 12-year-oldgirl set to be married off to a 17-year-old she has never met, told the Sunday Times that the ceremony would go ahead “without the need for her permission.”\n\nA local cleric confirmed that Amani could be married, as she had started puberty.\n\nIraq’s decision to introduce the Ja’fari law in January means that girls can be married based on perceived “maturity and physical capacity.”\n\nOne of Amani’s relatives admitted that, after the amendment passed, four of her younger cousins were quickly married off to older men for “financial reasons.”\n\nAn activist told the paper that under the new law, “parents can exchange daughters for money or status,” and the legislation amounted to “legalizing child rape.”\n\nEven before the law passed, 28% of girls in Iraq were married before the age of 18, and a further 22% of unregistered marriages involve girls under 14, the United Nations reported in 2023.\n\nGhezi, who oversees shelters for runaway girls of forced marriage under The Organization of Women’s Freedom Iraq (OWFI) in Baghdad, confirmed to the paper, “We have seen a growing black market in Iraq where fathers are selling their daughters, pulling them out of education, mostly because of poverty … but they have been encouraged by some [clerics] who may benefit.”\n\nGhezi added, “These are children who are not aware that their husbands can use the Ja’fari law to strip their rights — they can divorce them, marry a second wife, and take their children without dispute.”\n\nClerics often take a fee for blessing marriages, religious officials in Kadhimiya confirmed. One official admitted to talking a 15-year-old out of divorcing her husband, adding he would only discuss the subject “with her father’s permission.”\n\nDozens of businesses confirmed to the British outlet that since the Ja’fari law passed, they had increased sales.\n\nBaraa Macer, an influencer and bridal makeup artist, admitted that many of her clients are now under 10.\n\nA video allegedly displaying an 11-year-old girl cloaked in white shared on Macer’s page gained more than 250,000 views. Macer declined to confirm whether the content was monetized.\n\nAnother Iraqi makeup artist, Zainab Saleem, also known as Makera Dobaa, claimed she disagreed with child marriage but shared her underage client’s videos because “younger brides get more views” and people ask for ages in the comments.\n\nSaleem said her youngest client this year was 14, though confirmed that her clients this year had been younger than in previous.\n\nRuweida, a bridal make-up artist in Sadr City, also said her clients this year were “almost entirely children.”\n\nRuweida described a “10-year-old girl who cried throughout her hair and makeup, and still her family was proud to say she was marrying an older man. She was trying to resist, but I could see she had bruises all over her head … this is very common.”",

    "fullText": "A winter weather blast has wreaked havoc across Metro Detroit including on the roads.\n\nA large crash involving multiple vehicles happened on NB I-75 near McNichols.\n\nSnow squalls and high winds have led to power outages and slow driving conditions.\n\nFOX 2 - Snow squall conditions led to a large crash scene involving three semi-trucks, and about two dozen vehicles on I-75 in Detroit Monday afternoon.\n\nThe crash scene on the northbound side of the freeway after McNichols has been cleared and that side of the freeway is now open. Some final tows were needed and some salt treatments were required on the roadway.\n\nAccording to state police, several small crashes may be the culprit rather than one large pile-up.\n\nCooper, a driver who was caught in the middle of the chain of freeway crashes, said that the snow squall created a white-out condition. His car slammed underneath a semi-truck, he said - coming away injured somehow.\n\n\"It was a whiteout with no visibility and like I said, everyone was going 25 or 30 until they weren't. My car got totaled,\" he said.\n\nThe exact number of vehicles involved, is not known at this time.  All lanes were blocked.\n\n\"Some of the semis may have struggled, some of the cars may have struggled, whatever it is this is probably going to (last) the majority of the day,\" said Diane Cross of MDOT in a phone interview with FOX 2. \"At the moment we have northbound 75 closed at McNichols. Don't be surprised if we move that back to the Davison so that traffic can move freeway to freeway.\"\n\nCross said that special towing vehicles were needed for the semi-trucks.\n\n\"We have EMS, Michigan State Police out there to determine the cause.\"\n\nAccording to MDOT, the left shoulder, left lane, right center lane, right lane and right shoulder are all blocked.\n\nThe backup stretched for miles with an early estimate of at least 20 vehicles or more.\n\nRoad conditions have been challenging all day due to an active winter weather day that began with fierce winds and continued with blinding snow squalls.\n\nWest M-10 and Woodward are possible alternate routes according to Cross.\n\nPower outages have been reported by DTE Energy while a number of flights have been delayed or canceled at Metropolitan Airport in Romulus.\n\nStay with FOX 2 \n\nInformation for this report is from MDOT and multiple sources.",

    "fullText": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Some Iowans are ringing in 2026 with a special election on the final Tuesday of the year, casting ballots for a state senator in a race that offers Republicans an opportunity to reclaim two-thirds control of the chamber.\n\nDemocrat Renee Hardman faces Republican Lucas Loftin in the special election for the state Senate seat representing parts of Des Moines’ suburbs. The seat is vacant after the Oct. 6 death of state Sen. Claire Celsi, a Democrat.\n\nFlipping the seat would give Republicans supermajority status once again, just months after a Democrat flipped a Republican seat in an August special election, giving Democrats 17 seats to Republicans' 33. Celsi's death left the Democratic caucus at 16.\n\nSenate Republicans left Des Moines last spring with a supermajority, which allows the party to easily confirm Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds’ appointments to state agencies and commissions. A Hardman win in Tuesday's election would limit Republicans’ power in the Senate as lawmakers prepare to return to Des Moines for the 2026 legislative session. Without a supermajority, Republicans would have to rely on support from at least one Democrat to approve Reynolds' nominees.\n\nDemocrats outnumber Republicans in the district by about 3,300 voters, 37% to 30%, but a holiday week special election may prove more volatile.\n\nAbout a third of registered voters in the district are affiliated with another party or register without a political party.\n\nCelsi won her 2024 reelection bid against a Libertarian competitor with 69% of the district electorate. But she earned a smaller majority of voters in 2022 – 58% — against a Republican, who earned 42% of the vote. That was similar to the share Republican President Donald Trump received in the district last year.\n\nHardman, who would be the first Black woman elected to the Iowa state Senate, is the CEO of nonprofit Lutheran Services of Iowa and a member of the West Des Moines City Council. Loftin, who started as a tree trimmer for Wright Service Corp. in 2007, has since transitioned to software and data project management for the environmental services company.\n\nSchoenbaum reported from Salt Lake City, Utah.",

    "description": "These teams could roll the dice.",
    "fullText": "Finding the best fits for mid-round quarterbacks in the 2026 NFL Draft originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe story of the 2026 NFL Draft's quarterback class will be defined by its thinning at the top. Fernando Mendoza is the odds-on favorite to go 1.01. If he declares, Oregon's Dante Moore shouldn't last much longer. But this isn't the class the football world was sold, and teams' actions early in the offseason will reflect that.\n\nInstead, we are left with an unsteady crop of quarterbacks, many of whom decided to return to school. The seniors that aren't afforded that option are headed to the league with less hype than the summer suggested and little expectations of rookie-year playing time.\n\nIn an NFL era that has rendered the Day 2 quarterback an endangered species, several passers may fall into Day 3. While that has consequences for their rookie contracts, it could also open the door for more competitive teams offering a promising path to development.\n\nGarrett Nussmeier, LSU: Arizona Cardinals\n\nA Day 2 option that I've penciled into prior mock drafts is Nussmeier heading to the desert. It may not come as early as initially anticipated, but there's reason to believe that both parties could benefit from a fresh start.\n\nKyler Murray has proven he isn't the answer in Arizona. He may return for one last stand, but at some point, the Cardinals will need a new option under center. Unlike the out-of-structure prowess that Murray enjoys, Nussmeier projects more like a game manager. Similar to Jacoby Brissett, Nussmeier can win pre-snap and run the offense as it's intended, opening up the middle of the field and feeding receivers with more consistent targets.\n\nThe Cardinals prefer Brissett's style to Murray. Opting for Nussmeier provides a similar skill set with more credibility as a long-term option.\n\nNussmeier dealt with an injury to his midsection and wasn't quite as polished in 2025. As the floor drops on his stock, Arizona can take a shot on a new passer without wasting resources on a potential first-round prospect in 2027.\n\nJohn Mateer, Oklahoma: Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n\nThe Buccaneers have been beneficiaries of Baker Mayfield's career resurgence. Unfortunately for Tampa, his step back has left them closer to quarterback purgatory than they would like to admit.\n\nI'm lower than most on Mayfield, but this isn't an indictment on his status as next year's quarterback. He'll likely return and do so with the optimism of a healthier squad (and probably a new head coach). We know that this offense can work around Mayfield's measurable shortcomings, and living with his volatility has been a welcome part of the experience. Thus, a pivot to Mateer in April makes sense.\n\nMORE: Cole Payton gives Senior Bowl a small-school boost at quarterback\n\nMateer wouldn't start right away, but his similarities to Mayfield make him a viable backup in this offense and provide the Buccaneers with an off-ramp if contract talks get messy.\n\nMateer needs development before he starts on Sundays. He's more comfortable out of structure than inside it, draws pressure on himself in the pocket, and can be too reliant on his legs. Still, that mobility should amplify a below-average backfield in ways that Mayfield's scrambling has not.\n\nAt Oklahoma, Mateer's play style and moxie made him the Sooners' spiritual successor to Mayfield. He could have a similar opportunity in a perpetually-winnable NFC South.\n\nCarson Beck, Miami: Indianapolis Colts\n\nIndianapolis has created a special kind of catastrophe. Daniel Jones seems likely to return, albeit off an Achilles and not necessarily ready for Week 1. With limited mobility, he's a tough passer to trust. An orbital fracture further curtailed Anthony Richardson's development. I don't know what the Year 4 version of him looks like, and after his historically poor performances in 2024, I'm not sure I (nor Shane Steichen) want to find out.\n\nThe Colts don't have the ammo to take an early-round passer, either. This is a room that, as currently constructed, has one of the lowest floors in football.\n\nIndianapolis needs a polished passer who can keep Steichen's offense on the tracks and do enough for the ground game to churn out victories. Early on Day 3, Miami's Carson Beck might be the best bet to do so.\n\nDespite flashing early in the year (and entering the 2025 cycle as the preseason QB1), Beck profiles as a backup who has more present-day competence than long-term upside. He's played a lot of college ball against premium competition and has enough tools to trust with playing time. Throw in the allure of Steichen's wizardry and squint hard enough, and Beck is a low-risk dice roll of getting the Colts out of this mess.\n\nDrew Allar, Penn State: Detroit Lions\n\nIt was a nightmare season for everyone in Happy Valley, none more than Drew Allar.\n\nOnce a first-round hopeful, Allar began the cycle as a Day 2 option with enough upside to get Round 1 looks. He struggled in 2025, and an ankle injury ended his college career.\n\nThere is significant uncertainty in this profile. His broken ankle could dampen his athleticism, limit a skill-set that wasn't particularly twitchy, or keep him from getting crucial reps for his intangible development. He could also be fine! But no longer is Allar a polarizing passer for teams to take at a discount.\n\nAllar never proved he could cash in on his elite physical traits, even with Penn State's army of top recruits. Now, he enters the league without a real platform year and injury concerns headlining his profile.\n\nAllar needs to land on a team with a strong offensive infrastructure and no demand to play in Year 1. Few teams check those boxes like the Detroit Lions. Jared Goff isn't going anywhere anytime soon, and it doesn't make sense to move him until after the 2026 season, regardless of his performance.\n\nYet, the Lions' window is closing fast, and as Super Bowl aspirations shrink, patience for Goff will follow. There's a world in which the 2027 Lions are led by another quarterback, leaving at least one season for Allar to get healthy and develop in the incubator of Detroit's offense. Armed with an elite ground game, quality receivers, and a good young coach, Allar makes about as much sense on paper as a Day 3 project can get.\n\nCole Payton, North Dakota State: Carolina Panthers\n\nThere's a fog of war that comes with evaluating NDSU talents. The talent gap between the Bison and their competition is as fierce as any in college football, and their NFL quarterbacks have reflected that uncertainty. Carson Wentz was an MVP favorite who quickly became a castaway. Easton Stick never stuck, and Trey Lance will start in Week 18 on his third team in as many years.\n\nPayton doesn't have to follow any of those paths, but the pre-draft circuit will be crucial in selling himself to NFL evaluators.\n\nThe Panthers can't get away with drafting a quarterback in Round 1, especially if they win in Week 18 and get to host a playoff game. That doesn't change their circumstances under center, where Young has taken a bumpy road to below average.\n\nEventually, Carolina will look to move off of Young and the limitations of being the league's shortest passer. Payton offers an imposing frame as a rusher and surplus arm talent, earning him some looks as a potential starter. Sitting behind Young gives him a chance to learn under quarterback guru Dave Canales, and if he gets a chance to play, that same volatility could serve the Panthers well.\n\nIf Payton starts and plays well, Carolina can strike gold and justify moving on from Young. If the jump from NDSU to the NFL is too large for Payton to clear, he might be bad enough to get the Panthers a top pick. In either scenario, he's unlikely to set the career mark for lowest yards per completion, unlike Carolina's current quarterback.\n\nEmmett Johnson scouting report: Nebraska's back makes case for RB2\n\nTop prospects the Kansas City Chiefs can pick after Patrick Mahomes' injury\n\nArch Manning's NFL Draft decision means doubling down on Texas\n\nLaNorris Sellers' 2026 NFL Draft decision leaves more questions than answers",

The Athletic’s James L. Edwards III broke down Hart’s lower-body setback on Saturday.\n\n“New York Knicks do-it-all guard Josh Hart will miss at least the next three games with a right sprained ankle,” Edwards reported.\n\n“Hart suffered the injury in the fourth quarter of New York’s Christmas Day victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers.”\n\n“Hart, per league sources, is still undergoing further tests and will be reevaluated when the Knicks return from a three-game road trip that begins against the Atlanta Hawks on Saturday and ends with the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday.”\n\nThere’s no question it’ll be difficult for the Knicks to be the best version of themselves without Hart in the lineup.\n\nThe Villanova product is among the best rebounding guards in the league, always plays under control, is an underrated downhill attacker, and is a much-improved perimeter shooting threat.\n\nHart is averaging 12.3 points, 8.0 rebounds, and 5.1 assists per game with New York this season, shooting 49.8% from the field and 38.9% from beyond the arc.\n\nHopefully, Hart isn’t sidelined for an extended period.\n\nMore NBA: Golf could play surprising factor in Lakers' LeBron James' retirement decision",

His return in late August was iffy, with three poor relief appearances of five. But he ended the season with a scoreless (two-inning) “opener” start, which hopefully reverses the curse for 2026.\n\nJuan Carela\nRight-Handed Starting Pitcher\nAge 24\n2024 High Level Birmingham (AA)\nAge relative to high level -2.5 years\nOverall 2024 MiLB stats (High-A/AA) 7-7▪️ 23 starts ▪️ 106 2⁄3 IP ▪️ 3.77 ERA ▪️ 114 K▪️ 45 BB ▪️ 1.238 WHIP ▪️ 1.5 WAR\n\nCarela has mostly flown under the radar since being acquired from the Yankees in at the 2023 trade deadline. But he has forced his way into an increasingly crowded rotation situation at this point, punctuated by seven brilliant starts for Birmingham to end the 2024 season yielding a 3.58 ERA and 1.163 WHIP while being well underage for the level. Just as Carela was moving closer to Charlotte and/or possible MLB appearances, he blew out his arm last March and underwent TJS.\n\nReudis Diaz\nRight-handed relief pitcher\nAge 20\n2025 high level ACL (Rookie)\nAge relative to high level -2.1 years\nOverall 2025 stats 1-1 ▪️ 1 SV▪️ 21 games (4 finishes) ▪️ 27 2/3 IP ▪️ 2.28.ERA ▪️ 18 K ▪️ 8 BB ▪️ 1.084 WHIP ▪️1.2 WAR\n\nWho? You’re forgiven for being unfamiliar with an extremely young arm who hasn’t yet gotten out of rookie ball, but our No. 77 prospect a year ago (then a starter, repeating the DSL and killing it) made a successful adjustment Stateside. He’ll return to starting in 2026, likely getting his feet wet in Arizona and getting a promotion to Low-A in the second half of the season.\n\nJacob Gonzalez\nSecond Baseman\nAge 23\n2024 SSS Prospect Poll ranking 9\n2025 SSS Prospect Poll ranking 24\n2025 high level Charlotte (AAA)\nAge relative to high level -3.3 years\nOverall 2025 stats (AA/AAA) 134 games ▪️ 8 HR ▪️ 61 RBI ▪️ .232/.307/.345 ▪️ 17-of-20 (85.0%) SB ▪️ 48 BB ▪️ 86 K ▪️ .990 FLD%▪️ 3.1 WAR\n\nAfter the incredible first half/awful second of 2024, Gonzalez rebounded for a solid campaign, the final third of which came in Charlotte. However, his time in Charlotte, a hitter’s playground, was a significant step back on offense. He’s on the cusp of the bigs but has created questions whether he’ll produce at all with the stick on the South Side.\n\nLucas Gordon\nLeft-Handed Starting Pitcher\nAge 24\n2025 high level Birmingham (AA)\nAge relative to high level -1.7 years\nOverall 2025 stats (High-A/AA) 3-11▪️ 24 starts ▪️ 107 2/3 IP ▪️ 3.59 ERA ▪️ 116 K ▪️ 42 BB ▪️ 1.161 WHIP ▪️ 1.5 WAR\n\nSomehow still, in completing his third season as a pro, Gordon is still vastly underrated. All he has done is put up a career 2.80 ERA while taking on a significant workload each season. Sure, there’s no overpowering fastball there, but Gordon’s cup of coffee at Double-A (where he vastly improved his ERA, 2.11 over four starts) indicates that he may evade the wall that softer tossers hit once they are in the upper minors.\n\nRiley Gowens\nRight-Handed Starting Pitcher\nAge 26\n2025 high level Birmingham (AA)\nAge relative to high level +0.3 years\nOverall 2025 stats 7-6▪️ 27 starts ▪️ 132 IP ▪️ 3.44 ERA ▪️ 151 K ▪️ 49 BB ▪️ 1.189 WHIP ▪️ 2.0 WAR\n\n“Workhorse” is not the sexiest attribute for a prospect, but it’s no chopped liver adjective, either. And Gowens is just that, topping system starters with 27 starts, 132 innings and 151 Ks. And yet somehow he has evaded the praise handed to 2025 wunderkind Tanner McDougal, despite some obvious similarities. He should get the call to Charlotte to start 2026 and be on the short list, alongside McDougal, for first call-up for a start in the majors.\n\nLandon Hodge\nCatcher\nAge 19\n2025 high level Crespi Carmelite H.S. (Encino, Calif.)\nScouting grades (40-80 scale) Hit 45 ▪️ Power 40 ▪️ Run 50 ▪️ Arm 55 ▪️ Field 50 ▪️ Overall 40\n\nThis teammate of White Sox first-rounder (and SSS Top Prospect Vote No. 7 player) Billy Carlson made history simply by being drafted (fourth round, No. 107 overall). The very first pick of Day 2 of the draft was a somewhat curious one, given MLB’s ranking as the 164th-best talent available in the draft and the presence of much more enticing talents (as high as MLB’s No. 35 prospect) passed over on Day 1. Hodge has a killer arm (another characteristic he shares with Carlson) and has a solid hit tool that’s more average than power.\n\nJavier Mogollón\nShortstop\nAge 20\n2025 high level Kannapolis (Low-A)\nAge relative to high level -1.4 years\nOverall 2025 stats 51 games ▪️ 5 HR ▪️ 19 RBI ▪️ .220/.347/.387 ▪️ 15-of-21 (71.4%) SB ▪️ 30 BB ▪️ 56 K ▪️ .971 FLD%▪️ 1.0 WAR\n\nAn ascending star just one year ago, we have to tap the breaks a bit on Mogollón after a lackluster first full season of minors ball. While still young for his level and managing to keep his head above water in a new league every season of his career, Mogollón’s undeniable hitting in Rookie ball fell off significantly with the Cannon Ballers. However, how much of that was due to battling injury is undetermined, as Mogollón was shelved for what turned out to be the season on July 2.\n\nRikuu Nishida\nRight Fielder\nAge 24\n2025 SSS Prospect Poll ranking 28 \n2025 high level Birmingham (AA)\nAge relative to high level +0.3 years\nOverall 2025 stats 115 games ▪️ 0 HR ▪️ 31 RBI ▪️ .273/.403/.308 ▪️ 40-of-52 (76.9%) SB ▪️ 75 BB ▪️ 69 K ▪️ .986 FLD%▪️ 2.6 WAR\n\nWhat other testament to Nishida’s flexibility can there be but to say in three years in our Top 100, his primary position has changed from left field to second base to right field. You won’t find a stranger profile in the White Sox system, as Nishida’s profile is one of extreme on-base ability and baserunning peskiness, at the expense of any power whatsoever. He was a seeming shoo-in for Charlotte at some point last summer, but stalled in Double-A.\n\nTyler Schweitzer\nLeft-Handed Starting Pitcher\nAge 25\n2025 high level Charlotte (AAA)\nAge relative to high level -3.3 years\nOverall 2025 stats (AA/AAA) 8-2 ▪️ 27 games (10 starts) ▪️ 99 2/3 IP ▪️4.61 ERA ▪️ 81 K ▪️ 41 BB ▪️ 1.344 WHIP ▪️ 0.8 WAR\n\nSchweitzer relieved in most of his games in 2025, but he remains a starter in our eyes given he was consistently paired with Tanner McDougal in Birmingham Barons starts. And in Birmingham, Schweitzer was divine: 1.27 ERA that included a long scoreless streak leading to a Charlotte promotion, 0.946 WHIP. However, everything the southpaw did as a Baron, he undid as a Knight (7.92 ERA, 1.740 ERA). While other gilded arms (Drew Thorpe, Grant Taylor) get to skip Charlotte entirely, Schweitzer was not so lucky. And that luck could prevent him from ever seeing the majors.\n\nGage Ziehl\nRight-Handed Starting Pitcher\nAge 22\n2025 high level Somerset (Yankees AA)\nAge relative to high level -2.7 years\nOverall 2025 stats (Low-A/High-A/AA) 7-6 ▪️ 22 games (21 starts, 1 finish) ▪️ 107 IP ▪️4.12 ERA ▪️ 90 K ▪️ 19 BB ▪️ 1.262 WHIP ▪️ 1.4 WAR\n\nZiehl was the return from the Yankees in the trade deadline swap of Austin Slater, and based on the nothing value of Slater this trade can’t possibly be a loss for the White Sox. The righty was a busy arm even before the trade, pitching at three levels for New York and settling at High-A for the White Sox. Pitching young for his level, Ziehl held his own pretty well.\n\nPast South Side Sox Prospect votes\n\nHere is how 2018 wrangled out — all 42 picks.

    "fullText": "One of Colorado‘s quarterbacks plans to enter the NCAA transfer portal. Ryan Staub, a redshirt sophomore, intends to enter on Jan. 2 when the portal opens, per On3’s Hayes Fawcett.\n\nStaub has played relatively sparingly for the Buffaloes over the past three seasons. He initially saw some playing time as a freshman in 2023, before he failed to complete a pass the following year.\n\nRyan Staub went 23-of-40 passing for 254 yards and a touchdown as a freshman in 2023, showing some promise. Of course, Colorado was relatively set at quarterback already with Shedeur Sanders taking over and eventually turning into an NFL Draft pick at the position.\n\nBecause Sanders had such a stranglehold on the job in 2023 and 2024, Staub threw just four passes as a redshirt freshman in 2024. He did not complete any of them, and he was sacked once.\n\nIn 2025, with Sanders off to the NFL, Ryan Staub some some limited work. His biggest set of action came in early September, when he played in games against Delaware and at Houston. In the Houston game, Staub went 19-of-35 passing for 204 yards and a touchdown. However, he was picked off twice. He also ran 11 times for 36 yards, showing some decent mobility.\n\nBut Staub would throw only 10 passes the rest of the season. He finished the year 30-of-55 passing for 427 yards, with three touchdowns and four interceptions. He also ran for one score.\n\nPrior to enrolling at Colorado, Ryan Staub was ranked as a three-star prospect and the No. 733 overall player in the 2023 class, according to the On3 Consensus. He also checked in as the No. 39 quarterback in the class and the No. 63 overall player from the state of California, hailing from Stevenson Ranch (CA) West Ranch.\n\nStaub figures to generate some interest in the transfer portal. He’s a quarterback who has seen some action in a major power conference game.",

    "description": "Utah Jazz forward has a chance to get his second All-Star bid in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Lauri Markkanen has a chance to make the 2026 NBA All-Star team.\n\nThe Utah Jazz forward was in the Western Conference’s top 20 in the first returns from All-Star fan voting. He came in at 16th in the West with just over 112,000 votes.\n\nWhile the top vote getters have already racked up more than 1 million fan votes, that doesn’t mean Markkanen is out of the running to make a team.\n\nThis year, as in years past, there will be 24 total All-Stars (12 from each conference) selected. But, there are two key differences to this year’s All-Star team format. This year, All-Stars will be selected without regard to position, so no more worrying about having a certain number of backcourt or frontcourt players.\n\nAlso, this year there will be three All-Star teams made up of a minimum of eight players. There will be two U.S. teams and one World team made up of international players.\n\nLuka Dončić and Giannis Antetokounmpo lead their conferences in the first fan returns in NBA All-Star Voting 2026.\n\nFans (50% of the vote) join NBA players (25%) and a media panel (25%) in selecting five players in each conference honored as starters.\n\nNext fan update: 1/6. pic.twitter.com/pHykl9yhTE\n\n— NBA Communications (@NBAPR) December 29, 2025\n\nThe five All-Star starters from each conference are determind by fans (50% of the vote), current NBA players (25%) and media votes (25%). Seven reserves for each conference are selected by NBA head coaches.\n\nAs the voting returns stand, Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Victor Wembanyama and Giannis Antetokounmpo will be easy top choices for the World team. So it looks like Markkanen will be competing for a reserve spot with Portland’s Deni Avdija, Houston’s Alperen Sengun, New York’s Karl Anthony-Towns, Indiana’s Pascal Siakam, Denver’s Jamal Murray and Chicago’s Josh Giddey.\n\nThrough 27 games played this season, Markkanen is averaging 27.9 points and 6.9 rebounds per game, while shooting 47.6% overall, 36.7% from 3-point range and 90.3% from the free-throw line. He made his first All-Star appearance in 2023, when he was an All-Star starter in the game that was hosted in Utah.",

    "fullText": "Imagine the world as you know it. Now, add 10 million people who care about birds. Did your world just get a little brighter?\n\nTen million. It’s an astronomical number. And yet that is exactly what Merlin, the free bird ID app developed by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, has accomplished since launching in 2014. Ten million active users the world over, from experts in the field to neophytes who let the app run in the background during their morning routine—and they’re turning enthusiasm and newfound joy into participatory science that helps protect birds and biodiversity.\n\nFrom Serbia: “It is my honor and pleasure that 165 of my photos were used to train Merlin to identify birds.”\n\nFrom Costa Rica: “Great for beginners. It motivates you to keep expanding your life list.”\n\nFrom India: “The app is so user-friendly…you can know about a lot of birds around you based on the pictures and their calls.”\n\nFrom the U.S.: “My four-year-old daughter and I were using Merlin to identify about 12 birds in our backyard. My daughter said to me, Daddy, your phone is magical. I’ve been programming for over 40 years. Merlin amazes me too.”\n\nSo how is it that millions of people now hold this magic in their pockets? To satisfy that question, we have to go back nearly two decades when the Lab’s idea for a bird ID app first hatched.\n\nThe year was 2008 and the Cornell Lab wanted to expand the capability of its online guide, All About Birds. According to Miyoko Chu, senior director of Science Communications at the Lab, users wanted more than the site could provide. “When we looked at analytics, we saw a lot of people typing in phrases like little brown bird. It became clear they were trying to use our website as a bird ID tool.”\n\nWhen we looked at analytics, we saw a lot of people typing in phrases like little brown bird. It became clear they were trying to use our website as a bird ID tool.\n\nIn the aftermath of the financial crisis, the Lab didn’t have capacity to reimagine All About Birds. These were the early days of broad-based artificial intelligence, so the team brainstormed a game of 20 questions that would utilize machine learning to produce a positive bird ID and proposed it to the National Science Foundation. “The heart of the proposal,” says Miyoko, “was the power of a bird’s name. If you see something and you don’t know its name, it’s really hard to learn more. But as soon as you can call it a Yellow Warbler, you’ve got all the information in the world at your fingertips.”\n\nAfter winning the NSF grant, the team needed to figure out how to teach the machine-learning model how to identify birds. Jessie Barry, who now leads the Merlin program through the Lab’s Macaulay Library, cites AI as the reason the project was funded, but concedes that the initial machine-learning task didn’t work all that well. “We didn’t have enough data,” says Jessie. Meanwhile, the team discovered a faster solution: the power of eBird data.\n\nIn the early 2010s, eBird, the Lab’s worldwide bird observation platform, was taking off. Tens of thousands of birdwatchers had already contributed millions of sightings, and their observations added two crucial factors: time of year and location. This meant that instead of trying to guess among, say, 800 species, eBird could help narrow it down to the few dozen species a person would most likely see. With just three more questions, it presented an answer. With time and location in hand, the team was able to compress the initial 20 questions into a simple five-question rubric to identify birds.\n\nHalfway through development, the team met another “grant”—Grant Van Horn, an undergrad at UCSD knocking on doors and looking for professors to work with. He had joined Caltech’s Visipedia project aimed at training computers to recognize objects in photos, using machine learning. To source the photos, they looked to Flickr, the world’s largest photo-sharing site at the time. According to Grant, “Flickr’s top photos of the day were some landscapes, a few portraits of people, and, inevitably, birds.”\n\nThe question quickly became: Can we train a computer to recognize all these bird photos?\n\n“The Visipedia team had scraped the web to build this dataset,” says Jessie, “but many of the birds were misidentified.” In a spirit of sharing and collaboration, the teams partnered to build a robust and accurate archive of images. As Jessie remembers it, “We approached a bunch of friends to get their photos off Flickr as a way to build the dataset.” By 2010, they’d collected enough images to have a basic working model. According to Jessie, “We were thinking, okay, 25% of the time, maybe this pre-Merlin system could identify a bird accurately.”\n\nAnother breakthrough came when the team realized they could build out Macaulay’s image archive by enabling eBirders to upload photos directly into the Macaulay Library as a part of their checklists. It has become a virtuous cycle; as birders share more images, the results get more accurate. Today, Macaulay’s archive is an asset that simply can’t be replicated anywhere else. On average, eBird users contribute an image every two seconds, and the accuracy of Merlin’s visual ID hovers around 98%.\n\n“By the way,” Miyoko adds, “this was almost not funded. Some of the NSF reviewers were quite skeptical, asking, How is this teaching anyone? It’s basically doing all the work for people, you’re just giving them the answer.”\n\nWhat impact would this new app have on the world of birding? Or, for that matter, on how people learn?\n\nWhere did the name Merlin come from? Miyoko remembers flipping through names of birds and coming to rest on the Merlin, a falcon that is both small and fierce. Merlin populations declined in the 20th century due to DDT and other pesticides, but bounced back once those were banned. Of course, Merlin also refers to the mythical sorcerer in King Arthur’s court. “We’d always talked about it being this magical experience where you would be so surprised that this name could pop up and give you the answer you were looking for,” says Miyoko. The team rallied around the name and began making final preparations for the app’s release.\n\nOn average, eBird users contribute an image every two seconds, and the accuracy of Merlin’s visual ID hovers around 98%.\n\nWith the NSF grant nearing its end, a fork in the road came when it was time to decide what to charge for Merlin. Alex Chang, who was leading the team’s web communications, says, “At that time, companies were selling their apps for $1, and it was moving toward $2.” But the Lab wanted to build a community, not just revenue. So Alex, who was also pursuing an MBA at Cornell at the time, wrote a business case showing that it was more valuable to offer Merlin for free in exchange for an email address.\n\nThat decision led to far more downloads, including in countries where any fee might be a significant barrier. It also gave the Lab a channel to connect with its users. Today, Merlin is at the heart of rapid growth in the number of participants and supporters of Lab programs, which has helped transform the scale of the Lab’s global conservation work. Merlin has become the Lab’s front door.\n\nThe app launched in 2014 with the ability to ID 285 species—just the most common backyard birds in North America—using the five-question rubric Jessie’s team developed . In 2015, Drew Weber joined the team to broaden Merlin’s geographic footprint. Drew is now the project manager on the Merlin team, and has helped expand Merlin to include 11,000 species, nearly every known bird in the world. When he comes through customs after an international birding trip, the agents get excited when he tells them what he does for a living. “We love Merlin,” they say.\n\n“Merlin is a wide funnel that brings people into the world of birds,” Drew says. “Some of those folks are going to download eBird and start collecting data. Some of them are going to start caring about birds and give money to protect their habitats. But for many others, Merlin simply lets them start to recognize and enjoy the birds around them in a way that wouldn’t have happened otherwise.”\n\nSusan Fox Rogers, author of Learning the Birds, agrees. “Merlin changed everything. This is something to celebrate in every possible way.” Susan started birding at age 49. “When I first went out, I couldn’t do it by myself. I needed the John Burroughs club, I needed to get to a baseline. It took two or three years, maybe 20 trips.” It used to be that to become an expert, you had to learn from another expert. But for millions of learners of all ages, Merlin has become their mentor.\n\nBut there was another quest on the horizon—one for the “holy grail,” as the Lab’s former executive director John W. Fitzpatrick puts it. For decades, the Lab had been trying to crack tech’s ability to identify birds by sound. Could Merlin become the “Shazam for birds”?\n\nIn many ways, it’s an unfair comparison: Shazam is an app trained to recognize the one true signature of a pop song in the swirl of a crowded room. Birds are different. They have more than one call. Songs differ slightly each time they’re sung. And even members of the same species can develop distinct dialects region to region. Add to that the sound of wind. Traffic. Your shoes crunching the forest floor. Or what about sound dampeners, like buildings and trees? Not to mention the songs of other birds.\n\nIf we get to the point where one in 20 people in the U.S. is engaged with birds when a local land trust reaches out, they’re going to be more ready to hear those messages.\n\nAs Jessie Barry remembers it, “When the pandemic hit in 2020, we saw [the number of] Merlin users go through the roof. So many people were watching birds, sometimes for the first time. It was a dream come true: The world is paying attention to birds. What can we do with this opportunity?”\n\nWhile attending an audio workshop in New York City with Jessie, Grant Van Horn was inspired by presentations that included spectrograms. “What struck me,” says Grant, “was that we were looking at photos of audio. I thought, Wait, they just take their audio and make a picture? I’m a computer vision researcher, I can absolutely work with that!”\n\nThe timing was right: eBird had just begun accepting audio uploads in 2015. That meant Grant had five years’ worth of recordings to experiment with. “Someone told me Merlin’s photo ID couldn’t distinguish between the Alder and the Willow Flycatchers. I wasn’t really a birder before all this, so I asked my colleagues how you’d tell them apart in real life and they told me they’d listen to the vocalizations.”\n\nSo like the presenters at the audio conference, Grant made pictures. Specifically, he took 30 audio clips apiece for both flycatcher species and rendered spectrograms. Just as he’d trained Merlin’s algorithms to recognize images of birds, Grant now used the same technology to recognize images of their sounds. “The computer was perfect. It’s like, 100% accuracy.”\n\nTo make Sound ID feel miraculous, Merlin needs to bank at least 100 clean recordings of every call for each species. To achieve this, around 350 experts annotate thousands upon thousands of spectrograms made from recordings submitted by people from all over the world. These annotators painstakingly draw and label boxes around individual calls in the spectrograms, helping to train and improve Merlin.\n\nJessie was anxious to get this capability into the hands of people while birds still held their attention, so Sound ID was launched in June 2021. According to Drew Weber, “Each spring, we see a massive uptake. That year we had a double bump in downloads: May for migration and June for Sound ID.”\n\n“When we first started,” says Alex Chang, “we got to number four in the app store’s reference category, and we thought, There’s no way we can beat the Bible, right? Like, how do you beat the Bible? But I guess Sound ID was the answer to that, because we got to number one.”\n\n“Sound ID put Merlin on the map,” says Drew. “It’s in the mainstream conversation now. Sarah Jessica Parker posted about it on Instagram. Sam Darnold, the Seattle Seahawks quarterback, has talked about it at press conferences. Sound ID was a game changer.”\n\nImagine the world as you know it. Now, add 100 million people who care about birds. Add one billion. These numbers may seem improbable, but Merlin’s growth continues to accelerate. This past spring, American usage of Merlin was up 40% over last year. Europe was up 70% over the same period, and there’s double-digit growth in Africa and Asia as well.\n\n“We have a long runway on these projects,” says Jessie Barry. “We’re building out Sound ID in South America, in Africa, really building a global team. We try to look a few years down the road for new opportunities, but right now we’re seeing big returns on the Lab’s mission—connecting people to birds is squarely what Merlin is able to do.”\n\nHow has this marriage of science and tech captivated so many people? “I think you can go all the way back to Arthur Allen and Peter Paul Kellogg,” Jessie continues. “Arthur Allen founded the Lab. Peter Paul Kellogg was an electrical engineer. Together they figured out how to record the first bird sounds in North America in 1929. So in some way, that combination of engineering and ornithology that built Merlin goes back to the Lab’s origin story.”\n\nIn Silent Spring, Rachel Carson’s landmark book about the environmental destruction caused by DDT and other pesticides, she pointed to the “silencing of birds.” What if spring comes and no birds sing? Of course, this formulation only works if people are listening.\n\nWith Merlin, more than 10 million people are tuning into the world around them. “I think we’re just starting to feel the scale of a community,” says Jessie. “If we get to the point where one in 20 people in the U.S. is engaged with birds when, say, a local land trust reaches out, they’re going to be more ready to hear those messages.”\n\nAlready there are signs that the next generation of birders is more conservation-minded. Less focused on personal lists, today’s birders see birds as neighbors. They’re asking questions about what birds need to thrive and what they can do to help. Susan Fox Rogers puts it this way: “If more people are using Merlin, then more people are thinking about birds. You can’t protect something unless you know it. You can’t love something unless you know it.”\n\nTop banner photo credits: Tiktok photos courtesy @theylovefrioo, @nonbinarying, @badgerlandbirding.

    "description": "This was supposed to be the year when autonomous agents took over everyday tasks. The tech industry overpromised and underdelivered.",
    "fullText": "This was no small boast. Chatbots can respond directly to a text-based prompt—by answering a question, say, or writing a rough draft of an e-mail. But an agent, in theory, would be able to navigate the digital world on its own, and complete tasks that require multiple steps and the use of other software, such as web browsers. Consider everything that goes into making a hotel reservation: deciding on the right nights, filtering based on one’s preferences, reading reviews, searching various websites to compare rates and amenities. An agent could conceivably automate all of these activities. The implications of such a technology would be immense. Chatbots are convenient for human employees to use; effective A.I. agents might replace the employees altogether. The C.E.O. of Salesforce, Marc Benioff, who has claimed that half the work at his company is done by A.I., predicted that agents will help unleash a “digital labor revolution,” worth trillions of dollars.\n\nNew Yorker writers reflect on the year’s highs and lows.\n\n2025 was heralded as the Year of the A.I. Agent in part because, by the end of 2024, these tools had become undeniably adept at computer programming. A demo of OpenAI’s Codex agent, from May, showed a user asking the tool to modify his personal website. “Add another tab next to investment/tools that is called ‘food I like.’ In the doc put—tacos,” the user wrote. The chatbot quickly carried out a sequence of interconnected actions: it reviewed the files in the website’s directory, examined the contents of a promising file, then used a search command to find the right location to insert a new line of code. After the agent learned how the site was structured, it used this information to successfully add a new page that featured tacos. As a computer scientist myself, I had to admit that Codex was tackling the task more or less as I would. Silicon Valley grew convinced that other difficult tasks would soon be conquered.\n\nAs 2025 winds down, however, the era of general-purpose A.I. agents has failed to emerge. This fall, Andrej Karpathy, a co-founder of OpenAI, who left the company and started an A.I.-education project, described agents as “cognitively lacking” and said, “It’s just not working.” Gary Marcus, a longtime critic of tech-industry hype, recently wrote on his Substack that “AI Agents have, so far, mostly been a dud.” This gap between prediction and reality matters. Fluent chatbots and reality-bending video generators are impressive, but they cannot, on their own, usher in a world in which machines take over many of our activities. If the major A.I. companies cannot deliver broadly useful agents, then they may be unable to deliver on their promises of an A.I.-powered future.\n\nThis setup turns out to excel at automating software development. Most of the actions required to create or modify a computer program can be implemented by entering a limited set of commands into a text-based terminal. These commands tell a computer to navigate a file system, add or update text in source files, and, if needed, compile human-readable code into machine-readable bits. This is an ideal setting for L.L.M.s. “The terminal interface is text-based, and that is the domain that language models are based on,” Alex Shaw, the co-creator of Terminal-Bench, a popular tool used to evaluate coding agents, told me.\n\nMore generalized assistants, of the sort envisioned by Altman, would require agents to leave the comfortable constraints of the terminal. Since most of us complete computer tasks by pointing and clicking, an A.I. that can “join the workforce” probably needs to know how to use a mouse—a surprisingly difficult goal. The Times recently reported on a string of new startups that have been building “shadow sites”—replicas of popular webpages, like those of United Airlines and Gmail, on which A.I. can analyze how humans use a cursor. In July, OpenAI released ChatGPT Agent, an early version of a bot that can use a web browser to complete tasks, but one review noted that “even simple actions like clicking, selecting elements, and searching can take the agent several seconds—or even minutes.” At one point, the tool got stuck for nearly a quarter of an hour trying to select a price from a real-estate site’s drop-down menu.",

    "description": "A new alloy combines the best of the refractory metals with cutting-edge engineering. The material might just revolutionize modern manufacturing.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nA new alloy combines the best of the refractory metals with cutting-edge engineering.\n\nEven these extremely tough metals can be made to deform and show bands of adjustment.\n\nThese kink bands add strength through subtle shifts in the crystal structure, reducing brittleness.\n\nIn recently published research, scientists have revealed a special alloy that could change the game with its combination of temperature tolerance, resistance to wear, and previously unheard of fracture toughness.\n\nHow do you make one alloy that has it all? The secret is a feature called a kink band, where the material naturally forms a certain way as it is heated and treated. As the saying goes, sometimes our flaws can lead to our greatest strengths. Turns out that’s also true for exotic alloys.\n\nMany metals are soft in their pure form—or, at least, softer than we’d like them to be for applications like manufacturing and heavy machinery. Long ago, humans realized they could combine two metals into one alloy (like bronze) and get results that were tougher, held a sharp edge better, and lasted longer.\n\nWhy are alloys so strong? Well, each element has its own atomic mass and particle size. Think about a pure metal like a game of Jenga. When you push on a block (or deform your metal), you know how that block is going to move. But in an alloy, your Jenga tower is built from blocks of different sizes, meaning it’s much harder to simply “push” (deform) them out of place. There are fewer of the neat lines that are prone to breakage.\n\nIn this paper, researchers from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and a handful of west coast universities collaborated on a new refractory alloy. Refractory—used colloquially to mean stubborn—in this case means an alloy that is extremely tolerant of very high heat. They’re made by combining metals from the fifth and sixth period of the periodic table of elements: molybdenum, niobium, tungsten, tangalum, and rhenium.\n\nThese elements have some of the highest melting points in the known periodic table. They also have very high hardness among the pure metals—although if we’re talking about materials in general, diamond still leaves them in the dust. That means when alloyed in a particular way, these metals (along with a few others with high melting points, like titanium and iridium) can become even more resistant to heat and wear, forming the family of refractory alloys.\n\nThere’s just a few problems. The same toughness and hardness that defines the refractory alloys often means they’re literally too hard to work with, with low ductility and a high likelihood of fracture. In other words, if you’re trying to metalwork a refractory alloy into any kind of shape, it will break instead of bend. We needed to find a middle ground where a very hard refractory alloy could take a hit and deform in the desired way rather than fracturing.\n\nTo do this, the Berkeley Lab scientists “specifically engineered” an alloy of niobium, tantalum, titanium, and hafnium, and formed kink bands in the metal. Inside a solid material like an alloy, kinks and jogs are terms referring to types of flaws that affect the alloy’s structure. Their details are more scientific, but a kink in a power cable or a street that jogs over a bit give you the intuitive idea. While the alloy forms, its crystal structures move around just enough to create these “stretch marks” or seams that show a change in crystal orientation.\n\nIn cables, a kink is often a sign of damage or unusual wear. In the crystals that we use as gemstones, a kink band might ruin the desired sparkly effect by disrupting how light passes through the material. But in the alloy, researchers found that the kink bands resulted from dislocation tolerance—meaning deformability without breaking. The particles in the alloy were able to adapt to a space where the crystals had shifted around, and those bands of adaptation made the results stronger.\n\n“Our work shows that contrary to conventional understanding, complex concentrated refractory alloys can possess exceptional fracture toughness across extreme temperature ranges, even in the cryogenic regime,” the scientists conclude. The next step is more research, since this is just one exploratory paper.\n\nBut in a world waiting on new technologies like quantum computing and nuclear fusion, the cryogenic regime—where materials are cooled to near absolute zero—is vital. The stronger we can make those materials, the better.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "Toyota is recalling 51,644 Camrys due to an issue with their power inverter assembly that could cause the hybrid sedans to lose power.\n\nThe issue affects 2025 to 2026 Camry models, and it also involves 3761 copies of the 2026 Toyota Corolla Cross Hybrid.\n\nToyota says it's currently working on a fix and plans to notify owners of the issue by February 13, 2026.\n\nToyota is known for its plentiful hybrid options, but one of its most popular models is part of a notable recall. Toyota says that 51,644 versions of the recently refreshed Camry could lose power due to a defective inverter assembly. This issue also involves 3761 copies of the Toyota Corolla Cross.\n\nAccording to a document submitted earlier this month to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the recall affects 2025–2026 Camry models and the 2026 Corolla Cross. The issue stems from the inverter that converts power from the hybrid system's battery to the electric motor, as a bolt inside the assembly could come loose and create an open circuit, which could either cause the vehicle to go into limp mode or lose power. Along with activating a warning light, the loose bolt could lead to a short circuit in certain situations that could cause a fire.\n\nToyota estimates that 34 incidents related to the problem have been reported, along with 15 warranty claims, which caused the company to issue a voluntary recall. While it doesn't currently have a fix for the situation, Toyota says it will inform owners about the necessary steps when those details become available. Meanwhile, the automaker will notify owners about the recall by mail by February 13, 2026. Any eventual repair costs will be covered under warranty.\n\nCar and Driver’s 10 Best Cars through the Decades\n\nLightning Lap Legends: Chevrolet Camaro vs. Ford Mustang!",

    "description": "Ukraine has used its pioneering naval drones to hit Russian targets like expensive warships. Now it has a growing fleet designed to fight on rivers.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's naval drones are now targeting Russia in waters other than the open ocean.\n\nIt recently unveiled drones designed for use on rivers, including the Barracuda drone.\n\nThe unit that operates the Barracuda said it was able to destroy a Russian base and boat.\n\nThe naval drones that Ukraine has used to hammer Russia's Black Sea Fleet are now targeting Russia in new waterways.\n\nThe 40th Coastal Defense Brigade of Ukraine's 30th Marine Corps said last week that an uncrewed \"Barrauda\" drone was able to penetrate Russian positions, leave mines, and strike Russian targets, damaging a Russian logistical base and a boat equipped with a machine gun.\n\nThe strike comes as Ukraine fields more naval drones designed to hunt Russian targets in smaller bodies of water.\n\nThe brigade shared combat footage that appears to have been filmed by a camera on the drone. The uncrewed vessel can be seen navigating a wide body of water before moving into a much narrower, brown-water channel.\n\nThe newly released video shows a camouflaged boat at a base, and then aerial footage shows a large explosion followed by images of a destroyed building along the water.\n\nThe footage indicates the attack did not take place on the open ocean, as many of Ukraine’s naval drone strikes have, but in a confined inland waterway; Ukrainian outlet Militarnyi reported that the strike occurred on the Dnipro River.\n\nUkraine has used drones across land, air, and sea to gather information on the enemy and strike Russian targets, and its naval drones have helped to weaken Russia's Black Sea Fleet. Ukraine doesn't have a proper navy with powerful ships, but the much cheaper drones have helped damage Russia's expensive warships, even forcing Russia to relocate many vessels further away.\n\nHowever, using drones in river environments or smaller bodies of water is a relatively new development for Ukraine, opening up a new range of targets for newly developed technology.\n\nDedicated drones for those areas, such as the Barracuda or others like the Ursula or Black Widow 2, are newer technology compared to systems like the Sea Baby or Magura drones for open ocean. Ukraine is constantly upgrading its naval drones and creating new ones.\n\nThe Barracuda drone was first showcased by the 40th Separate Coastal Defence Brigade in September.\n\nThe 40th Separate Coastal Defence Brigade showcased the Barracuda in September, saying the drone is designed to \"perform tasks that humans cannot,\" including evacuating people from coastal areas and delivering ammunition to dangerous areas.\n\nIt said a month earlier that the drone is modular, making it easy to swap in different types of weapons, from mines to grenade launchers. It also shared that it uses artificial intelligence, though details on that are limited.\n\nA special unit with the same name designed and launched the Barracuda and is the only one in the Ukrainian military operating the drone right now.\n\nIn recent months, Ukraine has said the Barracuda has destroyed a Russian logistics vessel and its crew and used naval mines to block channels between islands.\n\nDrones are being used \n\nDrones give Ukraine a key advantage because they can be produced domestically and at a fraction of the cost of many traditional weapons, creating an asymmetric threat to expensive assets such as Black Sea Fleet warships or T-90 tanks on the battlefield. Ukraine’s defense minister said last week that the armed forces expect to receive nearly 3 million FPV drones by the end of the year, most of them made at home — though Russia is also rapidly developing and fielding similar technology.\n\nWorried about the potential for a future conflict with Russia, much of the West is closely watching Ukraine's tactics and new war tech. Naval drones are one of the innovations Ukraine has said it is willing to export to partner nations.\n\nNATO allies and defense companies are working on the technology, particularly in the Baltic Sea, which is shared by a host of NATO members and Russia. The US military is also exploring the potential of these weapon systems.\n\nUS Army Gen. Christopher Cavoli, NATO's supreme allied commander in Europe, called the way that Ukraine was able to move Russia's navy with drones an \"arbiter of things in the future.\" He said that \"there seems to be a big role for unmanned maritime systems into the future.\"",

    "fullText": "Attorney Alex Spiro wrote a letter to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, urging him to stop a proposed billionaire tax.\n\nSpiro said his clients would \"permanently relocate\" if the measure were to become law.\n\nWhile Spiro did not say which clients he was referencing, he has previously represented well known billionaires and celebrities.\n\nA proposed billionaire tax in California has the wealthy threatening to flee, according to a letter written by power lawyer Alex Spiro to Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nIn a December 11 letter that was obtained by Business Insider, Spiro lays out his opposition to the proposed tax on behalf of his clients, whom he calls \"California residents who would be subject to the proposed Billionaire Tax Act.\"\n\n\"It will trigger an exodus of capital and innovation from California,\" Spiro wrote. \"Our clients have made clear they will permanently relocate if subjected to this tax.\"\n\nThe measure proposes that California residents with assets exceeding $1 billion be subject to a one-time 5% tax on the value of their assets. If the proposal receives enough signatures, it will appear on the state ballot in November 2026. If passed, it would apply retroactively to all California residents as of January 1, 2026.\n\nWhile Newsom has said he is against the tax and would \"fight\" it, he would not have the ability to veto it if it were to pass as a ballot measure.\n\nSeveral wealthy Californians, including venture capitalist Peter Thiel and Google cofounder Larry Page, have considered shrinking their presence in California, according to a New York Times report. Representatives for Page and Thiel did not respond to Business Insider when asked if they were represented by Spiro.\n\nOver the weekend, billionaire Palmer Luckey took to X to voice his opposition to the measure.\n\n\"I made my money from my first company, paid hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes on it,\" the Anduril cofounder wrote. \"Now me and my cofounders have to somehow come up with billions of dollars in cash.\"\n\nWhile it's not clear which clients the lawyer was referencing in his letter to Newsom, Spiro's client roster in the past has included billionaires and A-listers.

    "description": "Calls are growing for the UK to new rules for younger drivers - but what are they?",
    "fullText": "Ministers are expected to resist calls for a major overhaul of driving qualifications when they unveil their latest plans to improve road safety.\n\nCampaigners have argued that replacing Britain's current driving test regime could prevent thousands of injuries and deaths on the nation’s roads every year.\n\nThe existing ‘one-and-done’ system means newly qualified drivers face the same rules of the road as other more experienced motorists as soon as they pass their test.\n\nHowever, a growing number of experts are calling on Britain to introduce a so-called \"progressive\" or \"graduated\" system, similar to those used in countries such as Australia and the Republic of Ireland, which enforce tighter restrictions on new drivers.\n\nThe AA has estimated such a chance could slash the annual number of people hurt or killed in incidents by as much as two-fifths.\n\nEarlier this month, Simon Foster, police and crime commissioner (PCC) for the West Midlands, became the latest figure to demand the government make changes, calling progressive driving licences “proven, proportionate and urgently needed”.\n\nHowever, transport chiefs are expected to prioritise ‘other measures’ when the government publishes its upcoming Road Safety Strategy.\n\nA Department for Transport spokesperson told Yahoo News in response to Foster's comments: “Whilst we are not considering graduated driving licences, we absolutely recognise that young people are disproportionately victims of tragic incidents on our roads and continue to tackle this through our THINK! Campaign.\n\n“We are considering other measures to address this problem and protect young drivers, as part of our upcoming strategy for road safety – the first in over a decade.”\n\nCurrently, all drivers in England, Wales or Scotland are subject to the same rules whether it has been days or decades since they passed their practical driving test.\n\nNewly qualified motorists can choose to display a green ‘P plate’ if they wish, to indicate their lack of experience to other road users.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, an amber ‘R plate’ must be shown for the first 12 months after qualifying and speed restrictions are enforced.\n\nWhile a ‘graduated’ or ‘progressive’ driving licence could take several forms, it would likely see restrictions such as a top speed, number of passengers and the types of roads they can drive on.\n\nThese would be gradually lifted based on factors such as age, competence behind the wheel and driving experience.\n\nThis has been backed by the AA, which believes it could cut the number of serious accidents involving young drivers.\n\nLast year, the organisation’s president, Edmund King, said: \"The AA believes we need a system of graduated learning with a logbook whereby all learners need to demonstrate their skills on all types of roads and crucially on rural roads where 71% of new driver fatal crashes occur, and in different weather conditions and different times of day or night.”\n\nThe Republic of Ireland requires drivers to complete a two-year probation period, during which they must display ‘N plates’ and comply with lower drink-drive limits than more experienced road users.\n\nIn Australia, new drivers are banned from driving between certain hours at night and have limitations on the number of passengers they can carry.\n\nMotorists in New Zealand go through a three-step process, offering ‘learner’, ‘restricted’ and ‘full’ licences.\n\nThe government has seemingly ruled out any immediate prospect of overhauling driving licence rules in its upcoming Road Safety Strategy, saying instead it would focus on “other measures” to improve highway safety.\n\nThis could include tougher penalties for driving without insurance or failing to wear a seatbelt.\n\nNew research has also suggested a softening in attitudes towards drink-driving among the young.\n\nThe policy is expected to run until 2030, suggesting graduated or progressive licences are unlikely to be considered before then.\n\nThe strategy was expected to be published in the autumn, but it is still not known when the policy is likely to be released.\n\nThe approach has widespread backing.\n\nIn summer 2025, campaign group Protect Young Drivers was launched, a coalition of MPs, emergency services, insurers, academics, charities, campaigners and bereaved families.\n\nOrganisations signed up to the politically neutral, evidence-based approach include the National Police Chiefs' Council, the National Fire Chiefs' Council, the RAC, the AA, Brake, RoadPeace and IAM RoadSmart.\n\nMotoring organisation the AA has previously backed graduated driving licences, with its president, Edmund King, saying: \"We owe it to the next generation to introduce positive measures that will help give them healthy and prosperous lives.”\n\nThe RAC has also said it believes this could “help save lives on the country’s roads”.\n\nIt has also been supported by victims’ charities, such as Brake, which has argued such a scheme could save 4,471 casualties and £224m every year, just based on the impact it could have on drivers aged 17-19.\n\nIn November 2025, the family of Josh Atkins, who died in a car crash when he was 17, spoke about the need for a new system.\n\nCorey Owen Cooper was jailed for five years for causing the death of Atkins by dangerous driving after causing the crash the day after he passed his driving test.\n\nHis family have called for Britain to adopt a graduated driving licence system. “Young and inexperienced drivers need more support, more education, and more accountability before they are given full driving licence privileges,\" they said in a statement after Cooper's conviction.\n\n“This is not about punishment, it is about prevention. If such a system was in place, Josh would still be with us today, still living his life.”\n\nThe policy also appears to have clear public support, with a survey of more than 7,000 people by pollster YouGov showing a clear majority in favour.\n\nHowever, the government has so far refused to consider such a scheme, with Lilian Greenwood, the minister for local transport, telling a House of Commons debate early this year she hoped to improve safety without “unfairly penalising young drivers”.\n\nIn its Roadmap to Tackle Insurance Costs document, the Association of British Insurers (ABI) said the “adoption of graduated driving licences” has the potential to lower premiums.\n\nThe RAC has also suggested it believes a licensing overhaul could see young drivers in particular pay less for their car insurance.\n\nHowever, it also noted this is not certain and that other products – such as ‘black box’ insurance which tracks driving and qualifications such as the Pass Plus scheme – can already help reduce costs.",

She was last seen on a neighbor’s security camera shortly before 7 a.m. on the 11000 block of Caspian Spring, near San Antonio, CBS affiliate KENS5 reported.\n\nOlmos told the Bexar County Sheriff’s Office that her daughter regularly takes morning walks, and that she became concerned when “Camila did not return within a reasonable period of time,” according to ABC News. Mendoza Olmos did not take her phone with her.\n\n“I called her cellphone, but the cellphone was there on the bed and it was turned off,” Olmos told KENS5. “I put it to charge and went out to look for her. I thought I would find her like other times, walking, and we would come home together.”\n\nThe video footage from that morning shows an individual believed to be Mendoza Olmos searching inside her vehicle for an unidentified item before the footage ends, according to the Bexar County Sheriff’s Office. Investigators believe she left the area on foot, as her car was still at her home.\n\nMendoza Olmos, who is 5’4” and 110 pounds with brown hair and eyes, was last seen wearing a blue-and-black hoodie, baby blue pajama bottoms and white shoes, and is believed to be carrying only her car key and possibly her driver’s license.\n\nBexar County Sheriff Javier Salazar told ABC News that deputies and volunteers have been searching around the clock as they believe that Olmos is in “imminent danger.”\n\nMultiple agencies are assisting with the investigation, including the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, the latter of which is monitoring border crossings and international travel. San Antonio is about 160 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n“We definitely don’t want to miss anything,” Salazar told ABC News. “The ground search is somewhat limited to a couple of square miles. We’re also not ruling out that this case may take us outside the borders of the continental United States.”\n\nMendoza Olmos, a U.S. citizen, was not detained by ICE, Salazar said, adding that authorities are also investigating kidnapping, human trafficking and whether Mendoza Olmos left on her own accord.\n\nMendoza Olmos recently went through a breakup, however Salazar said that the split was mutual and that authorities found no indication of foul play. Those close to Mendoza Olmos are cooperating with the investigation.\n\nThe Sheriff’s office is asking anyone with information regarding Mendoza Olmos’s whereabouts to call the Bexar County Sheriff’s Office at (210) 335-6000 or contact the Bexar County Missing Persons Unit at missingpersons@bexar.org.",

The uncrewed vessel can be seen navigating a wide body of water before moving into a much narrower, brown-water channel.\n\nA post shared by 40 окрема бригада берегової оборони (@40obrbo)\n\nThe newly released video shows a camouflaged boat at a base, and then aerial footage shows a large explosion followed by images of a destroyed building along the water.\n\nThe footage indicates the attack did not take place on the open ocean, as many of Ukraine’s naval drone strikes have, but in a confined inland waterway; Ukrainian outlet Militarnyi reported that the strike occurred on the Dnipro River.\n\nUkraine has used drones across land, air, and sea to gather information on the enemy and strike Russian targets, and its naval drones have helped to weaken Russia's Black Sea Fleet. Ukraine doesn't have a proper navy with powerful ships, but the much cheaper drones have helped damage Russia's expensive warships, even forcing Russia to relocate many vessels further away.\n\nHowever, using drones in river environments or smaller bodies of water is a relatively new development for Ukraine, opening up a new range of targets for newly developed technology.\n\nDedicated drones for those areas, such as the Barracuda or others like the Ursula or Black Widow 2, are newer technology compared to systems like the Sea Baby or Magura drones for open ocean. Ukraine is constantly upgrading its naval drones and creating new ones.\n\nThe Barracuda drone was first showcased by the 40th Separate Coastal Defence Brigade in September.\n\nThe 40th Separate Coastal Defence Brigade showcased the Barracuda in September, saying the drone is designed to \"perform tasks that humans cannot,\" including evacuating people from coastal areas and delivering ammunition to dangerous areas.\n\nIt said a month earlier that the drone is modular, making it easy to swap in different types of weapons, from mines to grenade launchers. It also shared that it uses artificial intelligence, though details on that are limited.\n\nA special unit with the same name designed and launched the Barracuda and is the only one in the Ukrainian military operating the drone right now.\n\nIn recent months, Ukraine has said the Barracuda has destroyed a Russian logistics vessel and its crew and used naval mines to block channels between islands.\n\nDrones are being used \n\nDrones give Ukraine a key advantage because they can be produced domestically and at a fraction of the cost of many traditional weapons, creating an asymmetric threat to expensive assets such as Black Sea Fleet warships or T-90 tanks on the battlefield. Ukraine’s defense minister said last week that the armed forces expect to receive nearly 3 million FPV drones by the end of the year, most of them made at home — though Russia is also rapidly developing and fielding similar technology.\n\nWorried about the potential for a future conflict with Russia, much of the West is closely watching Ukraine's tactics and new war tech. Naval drones are one of the innovations Ukraine has said it is willing to export to partner nations.\n\nNATO allies and defense companies are working on the technology, particularly in the Baltic Sea, which is shared by a host of NATO members and Russia. The US military is also exploring the potential of these weapon systems.\n\nUS Army Gen. Christopher Cavoli, NATO's supreme allied commander in Europe, called the way that Ukraine was able to move Russia's navy with drones an \"arbiter of things in the future.\" He said that \"there seems to be a big role for unmanned maritime systems into the future.\"",

    "description": "Gregor Konzett quit his dream job at Google and gave up his US visa to be part of a startup accelerator program. Here's how he took a calculated risk.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Gregor Konzett, a 27-year-old former Google employee based in London. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I got relocated to work out of Google's Mountain View headquarters in 2024, it was a dream come true.\n\nI was raised in a small village in Austria, but I always dreamed of living in Silicon Valley. As a child who was excited about tech, I wanted to be where innovation happened.\n\nMy team was based in California, but I was working from London. Not even a year into my job, I was asking if I could be transferred.\n\nTwo years after getting hired as a software engineer, Google transferred me to Silicon Valley. Then, a year after that, I quit. I packed up my bags and moved back to London in just two weeks to participate in a startup accelerator program. It was worth the risk, even in this difficult job market.\n\nI joined Google in 2022 as a software engineer on the Google Pixel audio team. I enjoyed my job, but being in London, the physical distance turned minor questions into major delays. If I hit a blocker with a specific subsystem, I'd send a message and wait 24 hours for a reply due to time zone differences, or spend many late nights in chats with colleagues to unblock myself.\n\nAfter I was finally relocated to the Mountain View headquarters, living in the Bay Area was almost exactly as I had always imagined it from movies and TV. California is the most beautiful place I've ever been to, and being able to call it my home was incredible.\n\nIt was great to be part of an environment filled with so many other engineers. I remember going surfing with some people and just having the most Silicon Valley conversation ever about coding and deep tech. The only thing I didn't expect was that it's not this crazy, futuristic place. In reality, the infrastructure was just OK, and the internet speed wasn't even very reliable.\n\nThe work life at the Google headquarters was really nice. On average, it was a typical 9-to-5, and my team had a really great dynamic.\n\nFor the first few months, I was learning a lot, and everything ramped up quickly. My team gave me a lot of responsibility and trusted me to handle huge pieces of the system, which is amazing and rare for a company of its size.\n\nBeing in the office, I got to sit on the same floor as the teams building the specific subsystems I was coding for, and sit in meetings where product decisions were actually made. I could walk 10 feet, point at a whiteboard, and solve complex architectural issues in minutes. I learned \n\nHowever, after about a year, I felt like I had reached a natural ceiling in my work, and I wasn't learning much anymore. I wasn't super happy in my job, and my visa limited me from working on my own projects outside of Google, which was my real dream.\n\nOne of my closest friends got into a startup accelerator program in London and encouraged me to apply, with the plan of using it as an opportunity to cofound our own startup. When I got accepted with a start date only a month away, I knew I'd have to make a quick decision. I loved California, and leaving Google would mean leaving the country.\n\nThe job market has been terrible, and I questioned whether this was the right time to quit my job and potentially face unemployment. However, I felt confident in my technical background and having Google on my résumé, so I believed I could find another job.\n\nThe hardest part about deciding to quit was that it was objectively a really good job, and leaving meant giving up my path to a green card in the US. I was stuck in a dilemma: do I stay in a role I've outgrown for four, or potentially even more years, just to secure permanent residency, or do I quit to chase higher job satisfaction?\n\nI realized that staying for the sake of immigration meant stalling my career development.\n\nI figured now was the time to take a risk. I'm young and have a financial runway from my Google salary, and I don't have a mortgage to pay or a family to care for. So, I put in my two weeks at Google.\n\nIt's been a few months since I joined the program, and my friend and I are working on our startup, Vestry.ai, which fixes the observability gap for complex hardware. Our plan is to build while we're in the accelerator, get funding, and move back to California to live the startup life.\n\nCalifornia is ultimately the place to be for anything in the startup world. We want to be a part of the AI revolution, and that's just where you've got to be.\n\nI've been so busy with the program I haven't really had any time to think about whether I made the right choice, but I'm convinced I'm where I need to be.\n\nDo you have a story to share about quitting Big Tech? If so, please reach out to the reporter at tmartinelli@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "China says the drills are a stern warning to pro-independence forces, but they look a lot like a practice run.",
    "fullText": "Beijing is calling its massive war games around Taiwan this week a stern warning; however, they are also practice, offering insight into how China is thinking about a war for the island.\n\nThe big military exercise, \"Justice Mission-2025,\" that kicked off Monday is the latest large-scale Chinese drill aimed at preparing the People's Liberation Army for action such as bringing combined arms to bear against Taiwan, seizing control of the skies, isolating and assaulting the island, and combating foreign interference.\n\nChina mobilized its army, navy, air, and rocket forces for drills around Taiwan with a focus on combat readiness in the sea and air, blocking off key ports and areas, and what it said was \"all-dimensional deterrence outside the island chain.\"\n\nOn the southeast side of the island, China's military has been using bombers and anti-ship missiles against mock maritime targets, clearing the way for the navy's amphibious assault ships. The exercises, China's Eastern Theater Command said, are testing how well air and naval forces operate together. There was also an emphasis on eliminating targets at \"maximum range,\" key to cutting risk and keeping hostile forces at arm's length.\n\nTo the north and southwest of Taiwan, the Chinese military's destroyers, frigates, fighters, bombers, and drones, together with the long-range rocket forces, have been practicing coordinated seizure and dominance, pursuing training targets on land, at sea, and in the air, the way it might in a real fight.\n\nIn recent years, China has put greater emphasis on more realistic training.\n\nIn the air, Chinese fighters, airborne early warning aircraft, and electronic warfare planes have been training to effectively secure air superiority, while action at sea has been focused on defeating both surface ships and submarines.\n\n\"With vessels and aircraft approaching Taiwan island in close proximity from different directions,\" a command spokesperson said, \"troops of multiple services engage in joint assaults to test their joint operations capabilities.\"\n\nVideo shared by the Eastern Theater Command showed preparations for the drills, including trucks carrying missiles, fighter jets and other aircraft, and warship activity.\n\n🇨🇳 🇹🇼 🪖China holds large-scale combat exercises east of Taiwan\n\nThe drills held by the People's Liberation Army’s Eastern Theater Command were aimed at testing joint sea–air coordination, precise target detection, and rapid neutralization capabilities. pic.twitter.com/2veIz926ZJ\n\nThe training isn't entirely simulated and includes live-fire activities against mock targets. The live-fire exercises will take place in five maritime and airspace zones around Taiwan.\n\nChina's coast guard is also on patrol in the waters surrounding Taiwan. The island's defense ministry said on Monday afternoon that it had detected 14 Chinese navy warships and 14 coast guard vessels around Taiwan and outlying islands. Additionally, 89 aircraft, including J-10 and J-16 fighters, JH-7 fighter-bombers, and KJ-500 early warning and control planes, had been detected around Taiwan as well. None of the ships or planes violated Taiwan's territorial airspace or waters.\n\nTaiwan's defense ministry said that the island has been conducting its own rapid response drills amid the Chinese exercise.\n\nThe drills show how China's military plans to use its current forces in a coordinated attack, but in official releases, there were also indications about its future ambitions. On Monday, China released an artificial intelligence-made short video on a Taiwan fight.\n\nThe video showed various animals, like eagles and bees, transforming into uncrewed aerial vehicles, sea creatures becoming warships, and wolves turning into uncrewed ground robots. The AI-generated video, titled \"Joint Operations to Thwart 'Taiwan Independence' Attempts,\" also featured a pack of humanoid drones carrying rifles and walking through a war-torn city.\n\n🇨🇳 PLA Eastern Theater Command releases AI propaganda video 《联武群戈斩“独”道》(Joint Operations to Thwart ‘Taiwan Independence’ Attempts) https://t.co/gKUa2CanWJ pic.twitter.com/l0fUHtVVVp\n\nThe propaganda video, despite its artistic styling and the featuring of some technology not currently known to exist, suggests China is aiming for an integrated approach using a range of uncrewed systems and advanced capabilities, like submarines and warships and aircraft.\n\nCombining assets has been an important part of the latest military drills. Effectively integrating wide-ranging combat capabilities for combined arms warfare is a challenging feat though.",

    "description": "Beyoncé is officially a billionaire, according to Forbes. She joins wealthy musicians like Taylor Swift and Rihanna in the elite club.",
    "fullText": "Less than 10 years after Beyoncé famously sang, \"I just might be a Black Bill Gates in the making,\" she's been named a billionaire.\n\nBeyoncé's already-formidable net worth surged after a pair of successful tours: the 2023 Renaissance World Tour, which grossed nearly $600 million, and the 2025 Cowboy Carter Tour, which Forbes described as \"the most successful concert tour\" in the history of country music.\n\nIn addition to live performances and lucrative merchandise sales, Beyoncé has spent decades building her business empire. She founded Parkwood Entertainment in 2010, followed by a clothing line, Ivy Park, a hair-care brand, Cécred, and a whiskey label, SirDavis.\n\nNevertheless, as Forbes reports, the bulk of Beyoncé's fortune remains rooted in her music. Beyoncé controls the rights to her valuable album catalog, from 2003's \"Dangerously In Love\" to 2025's \"Cowboy Carter\" and beyond. All production costs for her music, documentaries, and concerts are handled in-house through Parkwood.\n\n\"When I decided to manage myself, it was important that I didn't go to some big management company,\" Beyoncé said while promoting her 2013 self-titled album. \"I felt like I wanted to follow the footsteps of Madonna and be a powerhouse and have my own empire and show other women when you get to this point in your career, you don't have to go sign with someone else and share your money and your success — you do it yourself.\"\n\nJay-Z has been pursuing mogul status for over three decades.\n\nThe East Coast rapper founded Roc-A-Fella Records in 1995. Since then, Jay-Z has started his own sports agency, Roc Nation Sports. He bought and sold the music streaming platform Tidal, netting himself $149 million, according to a 2021 Forbes report. He owns stakes in the Champagne brand Armand de Brignac and the Cognac brand D'Ussé. His umbrella company, Roc Nation, has inked a multimillion-dollar partnership with the NFL. The list goes on.\n\nAll that, in addition to his extremely popular discography, has contributed to his vast wealth. As of December 2025, Forbes estimates Jay-Z's net worth to be $2.5 billion, making him the richest musician on this list.\n\nBloomberg reported that Taylor Swift became a billionaire in October 2023. Forbes corroborated this report in April 2024, about halfway through her record-smashing Eras Tour. By the end of its two-year run, the Eras Tour became the first in history to gross $2 billion.\n\nSwift redistributed a significant portion of her touring profits to her crew, reportedly handing out $197 million in bonuses alone. She continued to donate millions to charitable organizations through 2025, including Feeding America, the American Heart Association, MusiCares, ACM Lifting Lives, and the CMA Foundation.\n\nUnlike many of her peers, Swift's wealth comes solely from her — she doesn't have any lucrative side hustles. Swift's sizable net worth estimates are largely based on the value of her musical catalog, which she owns outright. Swift's 12th studio album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" sold over 4 million copies in its debut week, smashing the single-week album sales record and finishing the year as the top-performing album on the Billboard 200 chart.\n\nAs of December 2025, Forbes estimated Swift's net worth to be $1.6 billion.\n\nIn September 2024, Bloomberg estimated Selena Gomez's net worth to be $1.3 billion, largely thanks to her makeup brand, Rare Beauty.\n\nHowever, Forbes has estimated Gomez's net worth to be roughly $700 million, citing reported cash flow issues with Wondermind, the startup Gomez cofounded in 2021 with her mother, Mandy Teefey, and entrepreneur Daniella Pierson.\n\nStill, Forbes reports, \"Gomez's biggest asset is her estimated 51% stake in Rare Beauty.\" The vegan and cruelty-free brand is widely recognized as one of Sephora's biggest money-makers and most popular celebrity beauty lines; the cult-favorite blush alone generated $70 million in 2022.\n\nIn addition to her success as a businesswoman, Gomez is a celebrated actor. She has been nominated for several Golden Globes for the hit Hulu comedy series, \"Only Murders in the Building.\" She was also nominated for a Golden Globe for her supporting role in the 2024 film \"Emilia Pérez.\"\n\nGomez executive produces many of her own projects, including \"Only Murders,\" HBO's \"Selena + Chef,\" and Disney Channel's \"Wizards Beyond Waverly Place,\" a sequel to the show that made Gomez famous as a teenager.\n\nGomez began releasing albums while starring on \"Wizards of Waverly Place\" via Disney's Hollywood Records. Since signing a new contract with Interscope in 2014, Gomez has released two solo albums and a handful of top-10 hits. Her latest album, \"I Said I Love You First,\" is a collaboration with her fiancé, Benny Blanco.\n\nOver 50 years after The Boss released his first album, \"Greetings from Asbury Park,\" the New Jersey legend was named a billionaire by Forbes. As of December 2025, Forbes estimates Bruce Springsteen's net worth to be $1.2 billion.\n\nAs Variety reported, much of Springsteen's wealth comes from the 2021 sale of his music catalog to Sony for $500 million.\n\nIn addition to that mega-sale, Springsteen is constantly on the road, earning money from his packed touring schedule with the E Street Band.\n\nForbes estimates Rihanna's net worth to be $1 billion.\n\nDespite Rihanna's decadelong reign as a hitmaker, she hasn't released an album since 2016's \"Anti,\" which means that most of her wealth is from her two eponymously named brands: Fenty Beauty, which she co-owns with the French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH, and Savage X Fenty, a lingerie brand.\n\nAfter its initial launch in 2017, Fenty Beauty has since expanded to encompass Fenty Skin, Fenty Hair, and Fenty Fragrance. Rihanna was also named Puma's creative director in 2014.",

    "description": "While aboard Royal Caribbean's Wonder of the Seas, I learned the hard way that the bumpiest rooms on a cruise ship are at the front.",
    "fullText": "The first night of my first cruise was terrifying. The floor trembled beneath me. I was startled by booming noises coming from the decks above and below mine. Was that furniture falling, sliding, and crashing into walls?\n\nI sat stiffly on the couch at midnight, determined to stay awake and prepared for disaster. I read the emergency instructions over and over for what felt like hours until I accidentally fell asleep.\n\nWhen I woke up, I rushed out the door to ensure everything was all right. As seemingly unfazed cruisers filled the buffet and lined up for the water slides, I realized I'd experienced a normal night at sea.\n\nThis was back in April 2022, when I booked a room on one of the largest cruise ships in the world, Royal Caribbean's 18-deck Wonder of the Seas.\n\nFor $2,000, I spent seven nights in a 179-square-foot ocean-view stateroom at the very front of deck eight. It was a mid-tier room — a step above the windowless interior staterooms, a step below staterooms with a balcony, and two steps below a suite.\n\nAfter my first rocky night aboard the ship, I wondered whether everyone had the same experience. So, I talked to some fellow passengers who were seasoned cruisers. They told me that the front of the ship is one of the worst places to be if you're prone to seasickness. They said that higher decks in the middle of the ship feel calmer and more stable.\n\nSince my room on the 18-deck ship was situated at the front of the eighth floor, I felt constant motion in my room. As someone who gets motion sickness from the slightest movement of bathwater, this spoiled many aspects of my first cruise.\n\nSome nights were rockier than others. On the roughest nights, I heard and felt a similar sensation to thunder beneath me every few minutes. Loud thumps and heavy vibrations in my room sounded like large pieces of furniture colliding.\n\nDuring the days at sea, it was especially challenging for me to eat and participate in activities. And I didn't feel rested for my excursions at port stops, which included hikes in the sun.\n\nCruise passengers prone to motion sickness should book a room in the middle of the ship to feel the least amount of rocking.\n\nI wish I'd researched how the location of a cabin can affect the amount of motion you feel while the ship is moving before booking my cruise. Next time, I'd choose a room in the middle of the ship.",

    "description": "Family scapegoats, often blamed for larger family issues, can struggle with boundaries and trust",
    "fullText": "On the surface, a family scapegoat often looks as if they're the problem child.\n\nThey might be the college dropout in a legacy of Ivy Leaguers or the introverted gamer in a family of outgoing athletes. Sometimes, they're just the foil to their golden-child sibling; more aloof or less financially successful.\n\nThese are the black sheep that some parents seek therapy to \"fix.\" However, the issue usually lies in the family dynamic itself, not the individual child, Annie Wright, a licensed marriage and family therapist in California, told Business Insider.\n\n\"There's a family systems issue, but they're pointing to one person as the scapegoat,\" Wright said. Behind the scenes, one spouse could be having an affair, the parents could be having explosive fights, and the marriage could be breaking down. By being assigned blame for the entire family's dysfunction, family scapegoats become \"the person who holds the unconscious collective burden of the family.\"\n\nWright shared some signs you might be the scapegoat of your family, even if you do your best to fit in.\n\nScapegoats don't always feel like they're underachieving in the family. Some might feel the opposite: in a family that enforces more rigid gender roles, Wright said, you might be the black sheep if you're the first woman to go to college or work as a CEO.\n\nThe point is that scapegoats don't fit in. They're usually \"the person who acts antithetical to the norms of the family,\" she said. Simply doing things differently can get you branded as a family outsider.\n\nNot everyone responds the same way to being the family scapegoat. Some might even cycle through different stages, Wright said.\n\n\"At the far end of the spectrum, they really embrace that identity,\" she said, noting that some people lean into the black sheep label and continually try to rebel against their family.\n\nOn the other end, \"people can fight tooth and nail to fit in after the very painful experience of being rejected by a family system,\" she said.\n\nAnd between those two extremes, many people teeter between both, going through periods of withdrawal or fawning for approval.\n\nFamily dynamics can shape all other relationships, from romantic partnerships to friendships, Wright said.\n\nFamily scapegoats may experience social challenges such as \"feeling like they can trust others, feeling like it's safe to be themselves, feeling like they can assert themselves and have that be OK,\" Wright said.\n\nThey might hold back in relationships, fearing yet another rejection.\n\nIt's common to be drawn to what feels familiar, so family scapegoats might unconsciously seek out relationships where they still feel like the ones taking all the blame.\n\n\"If at some level you had a family system that othered you, you might be drawn to partners or friends who are critical of the way you are,\" Wright said. This is doubly so if their parents were vocally and frequently critical of them.\n\nAs painful as it can be to find yourself a family scapegoat, Wright said it's the beginning of a new path. You can alter the dynamics in your relationships, including those within your family, once you start to realize that you deserve better.",

    "fullText": "\"It's one of those products that's truly an experience,\" said Blessed Little Bungalow's Amber Guyton. People love how oversized and comfortable it is.\n\nIt helps that they may have seen it and sat on it in person. Diners at RH's rooftop restaurant have to first make their way through the showroom. \"The Cloud Sofa's everywhere,\" said Guyton.\n\nAnd it is as comfortable as it looks. \"It is like sitting on a cloud,\" said Studio London Co.'s Travis London. \"I mean, the sofa is basically one huge pillow.\"\n\nLondon said mimicking the pillows is the most important future. \"It has huge pillow backs\" with down filling, he said, so if you want that softness, that's what you should look for.\n\nIf you don't want to get a whole new couch, you could look into new pillows for your existing one instead. \"By doing that, you are adding more of the bounce factor and the comfortability,\" said London. \"So that is a great way to do it on a budget.\"\n\nMore generally, though, London said he likes his own RH sofa because it's lasted a long time, and he's updated it with new fabric as his tastes change. \"If you have good bones in a sofa, you can constantly reupholster the sofa throughout its lifetime,\" he said.\n\nThe deeper seat and 18.5-inch height of the Cloud Sofa's cushions might not be for everyone, said Guyton.\n\n\"The female clients I have, they don't wanna feel like a little kid with their feet dangling off the sofa,\" she said. People with mobility or joint issues may want something higher and less deep as well.\n\nThen there's the white or linen color you often see on the Cloud couch. \"You definitely have to be mindful of that with shedding pets and kids and markers and all of that,\" said Guyton. If you're looking for an everyday sofa, you might want to go with a darker color. Otherwise, you may end up with a comfy couch you don't actually feel comfortable sitting in, she said.\n\nBoth London and Guyton say looking at consumer reviews is crucial, especially if they include images of the couch in their home.\n\nThe first thing to pay attention to is how people describe the comfort, said Guyton. \"If I can't take a comfortable nap on my sofa, then I'm not going to invest in it,\" she said. You'll also want to pay attention to measurements, including width, seat depth, and seat height.\n\nSome retailers also provide information on how much wear and tear a sofa can withstand. \"Look at the Wyzenbeek test on a fabric's durability,\" said Paige Gray of Paige Gray Studios. \"The higher the better, but for upholstery, I wouldn't dip below 30,000 for lightly used pieces and 50,000 for more heavily utilized sofas.\"\n\nThen, London said, look for a retailer with a really good return policy. That way, if you don't like it or it doesn't fit, you can send it back with minimal hassle.\n\nMost companies are able to offer an estimated delivery window of when your couch will arrive.  Some of the couches on this list can ship and be delivered as soon as two or three weeks, while custom or made-to-order options can take upward of three to four months.\n\nGuyton said it's worth the wait to get what you want. \"You don't wanna settle for something just to fill the space,\" she said. \"You wanna know that it's going to stand the test of time.\"",

    "fullText": "A proposed billionaire tax in California has the wealthy threatening to flee, according to a letter written by power lawyer Alex Spiro to Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nIn a December 11 letter that was obtained by Business Insider, Spiro lays out his opposition to the proposed tax on behalf of his clients, whom he calls \"California residents who would be subject to the proposed Billionaire Tax Act.\"\n\n\"It will trigger an exodus of capital and innovation from California,\" Spiro wrote. \"Our clients have made clear they will permanently relocate if subjected to this tax.\"\n\nThe measure proposes that California residents with assets exceeding $1 billion be subject to a one-time 5% tax on the value of their assets. If the proposal receives enough signatures, it will appear on the state ballot in November 2026. If passed, it would apply retroactively to all California residents as of January 1, 2026.\n\nWhile Newsom has said he is against the tax and would \"fight\" it, he would not have the ability to veto it if it were to pass as a ballot measure.\n\nSeveral wealthy Californians, including venture capitalist Peter Thiel and Google cofounder Larry Page, have considered shrinking their presence in California, according to a New York Times report. Representatives for Page and Thiel did not respond to Business Insider when asked if they were represented by Spiro.\n\nOver the weekend, billionaire Palmer Luckey took to X to voice his opposition to the measure.\n\n\"I made my money from my first company, paid hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes on it,\" the Anduril cofounder wrote. \"Now me and my cofounders have to somehow come up with billions of dollars in cash.\"\n\nWhile it's not clear which clients the lawyer was referencing in his letter to Newsom, Spiro's client roster in the past has included billionaires and A-listers.

    "fullText": "Food can get expensive, which means it's as important as ever to seek out good value with every purchase — even the croissant you have with your morning coffee.\n\nJust ask Camari Mick, the executive pastry chef at The Musket Room, who's also a partner at Raf's.\n\nMick knows her way around a bakery. She grew up visiting local shops and then studied the art of pastry in fine-dining restaurants across New York City. At Raf's, Mick turns out breads, croissants, and more for the restaurant's daytime bakery while leading the rest of the pastry program.\n\nDubbed NYC's dessert doyenne, the chef has developed her own set of red flags to look out for whenever she visits high-end bakeries.\n\nHere's how you can tell if you're at a spot that's serving high-quality products.\n\nThe first thing Mick does when she walks into a high-end bakery is study the classics. If she sees croissants, she'll look at the plain variety, taking note of the folds that make up the pastry's lamination.\n\nSome great bakeries will have croissants with layers that look perfectly aligned, others might take on a more rustic feel and seem more obviously hand-rolled. Both are welcome characteristics, Mick says.\n\nBut it's a bad sign if the lamination is \"very thick, or small, or not uniform,\" she told Business Insider. And if the croissants look perfectly machine-made, something may not be right in the kitchen.\n\nMick also looks at the color of the croissants, which can clue you into how they may taste. If it's too blonde on the outside, it may not have much flavor inside.\n\nSimilarly, she says, a pastry probably won't be super flaky if it looks as if it was \"sweating on itself\" after being covered while hot, and you can see its layers are wrinkly.\n\nOverall, Mick says, if it doesn't look as if love has been put into the pastries, she \"probably will only just grab a coffee.\"\n\nMick says high-end bakeries should only be selling fresh bread.\n\nIdeally, you should touch the bread to see whether it's too hard. If that's not an option, there are telltale signs a loaf could be subpar.\n\n\"If you were looking at any bread and it looks super voluptuous and almost fresh out of the oven, you're good to go,\" she told BI. \"But if you see that the bread is already wrapped, whether it be in plastic or paper, it's probably an indicator that it was wrapped warm and is not going to be good.\"\n\nMick says fresh bread needs room to breathe, and wrapping it even while it's only slightly warm will cause it to steam itself, potentially making it soggy.\n\nBefore she even steps into a bakery, Mick may turn to Instagram for visuals.\n\nFirst, she'll comb through the location tag for any given bakery, keeping an eye out for whatever item she was hoping to order.\n\nShe tries to see whether the baked good looks the same in all of the photos shared by diners. If it looks different every few pictures, she's probably not going to order it because it's unlikely to be very good, or the quality may vary depending on the batch.\n\nAnd when you're going to be spending a chunk of change at a pricier bakery, you don't want quality to be left up to chance.\n\nThe pastry chef says her understanding of chemistry also makes her hesitant to buy certain pastries that aren't made to order.\n\n\"You know that a crispy something filled with a moist, wet filling is going to be soggy after sitting for, like, 10 minutes,\" Mick said.\n\nFor example, a bakery that fills cannoli shells and leaves them in the case until they're purchased raises some concerns.\n\nLook out for flies around the pastry case, Mick warns.\n\n\"If you see any type of fly problem or any kind of insect infestation in the case, be sure it's everywhere,\" she told BI.\n\nYou may even want to peek into the bakery's bathroom before placing an order.\n\nShe added: \"I'm a big believer on if their bathroom is messy, their kitchen is messy.\"\n\nThis story was originally published on April 3, 2024, and most recently updated on December 29, 2025.",

    "title": "What Is Zone 2 Cardio, and How Do I Actually Do It?",
    "description": "If you have the time for it, \"LISS cardio\" is a cheat code for fitness gains.",
    "fullText": "A healthy dose of cardio is an important part of your exercise routine, and for a lot of us, \"zone 2\" cardio is going to make up a big chunk of that. Low-intensity cardio—sometimes called LISS or “zone 2”—used to be an underrated form of exercise. It's super trendy now, after spending years on the sidelines while HIIT and lifting-only routines ran the field. But what is zone 2 cardio, exactly? How can you make sure you're doing it right? And is it really so bad if your heart rate drifts into zone 3?\n\nZone 2 training is cardio done at a steady, low intensity. It has benefits for aerobic training (so you can run faster), anaerobic training (helping you to recover faster between reps and sets, or between intervals), and it's also an efficient, low-fatigue way to burn calories.\n\n“Zone 2” is a term drawn from the five-zone system of heart rate training, and the same concept is also known by other names and metrics. To runners, it is “easy pace” or “long slow distance pace.” To cyclists, it corresponds to zones 2 and 3 of a seven-zone system of mechanical power. In other sports, like swimming and rowing, it’s often just called “easy” or “low-intensity” exercise.\n\nAll that said, there is no official definition of zone 2, and different devices won't necessarily agree with each other. The same heart rate might be \"zone 2\" on one device and \"zone 3\" on another. So please take the following with a grain of salt.\n\nThe hallmark of zone 2 training is that it’s relatively slow and that it’s done at a steady pace. You'll be aiming for a heart rate of around 70%, but that doesn’t mean doing intervals at 90% and then resting at 50%. It means holding that 70% level the whole time you’re exercising. You can do zone 2 cardio with any steady, repetitive movement. Popular methods are running, cycling, swimming, rowing, brisk walking, fast hiking, or churning away on the elliptical. (Walking can count if you're new to exercise; as you get fitter, you'll probably need to choose a slightly harder form of exercise.)\n\nTo be clear, it’s still work—it’s not the same as sitting around resting—but it should feel like you could keep going forever if you wanted to. You don’t stop a zone 2 session when you get tired, you stop it because you set out for a 30- or 45- or 60-minute session, and your time is up.\n\nZone 2 work builds your aerobic base. When you do cardio at this kind of easy pace, your body adapts to get more efficient at it. These adaptations are great for your health as well as your cardio fitness. You grow more capillaries (tiny blood vessels) to get oxygen and nutrients to your muscles more efficiently. You get more mitochondria in each muscle cell (you have thousands of mitochondria powering each cell) and you produce more of the enzymes that turn fuel from food into usable energy. Your heart and your lungs get more efficient at taking in oxygen and moving blood to your muscles, and your muscles become able to store more carbohydrates (in a form called glycogen) so that more of the carbs you eat are at the ready when you start a run or ride.\n\nFor runners, your zone 2 work, often called \"easy pace,\" should make up most (some say 80%) of your weekly mileage. The fitness you build doing easy running is what allows you to benefit from, and recover from, harder efforts like interval training.\n\nFor people whose main sport is more strength oriented (meatheads like myself), zone 2 cardio strengthens the same body systems that help us recover between sets, and even between reps. It increases our work capacity, letting us get more work done in total. As long as you’re eating enough, adding cardio into your routine should make you able to do more work in the gym, not less. (And no, cardio does not kill your gains.)\n\nAnd for people who are just exercising for health, zone 2 cardio is the perfect “moderate” exercise we’re all supposed to get at least 150 minutes of per week. It’s heart-healthy, and even people with medical conditions that limit their ability to exercise can often do low intensity cardio safely. (Ask your doctor to be sure, of course.)\n\nImportantly, zone 2 training is very low fatigue. More time-efficient forms of cardio and conditioning like HIIT, hill sprints, or CrossFit WODs are great for your aerobic fitness, but those workouts have to be high intensity to work, and you’ll be pooped afterward. They’re great in small doses, but they kind of have to be in small doses.\n\nTechnically, zone 2 is defined in terms of heart rate, and the idea is that you glance at your watch and see whether you're in zone 2 or not. (There are five zones, with zone 5 being the hardest, so zone 2 is the second-easiest). But even though “zone 2” is defined in terms of heart rate, there are so many caveats to determining your max and deciding on the zone boundaries that I don’t recommend that beginners calculate it from heart rate percentages at first. Unless you’ve actually gotten your heart rate up to a maximum effort level, and know what that number is, you don’t really know your max heart rate.\n\nSo if you're a beginner, the best way to know if you’re in zone 2 is to ignore your watch and instead pay attention to your effort, and how it feels. On a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is nothing and 10 is all-out sprinting, low intensity cardio is about a 3 to 5. You’re working, but not very hard. If your breath starts to get ragged, or if you feel like you're getting pretty damn tired and you can't wait for this to end, you're probably somewhere 7+ and definitely going too hard for a zone 2 workout.\n\nA zone 2 pace is conversational, and it’s sometimes described with a “talk test.” If you could tell your friend about your day while you’re exercising, you’re probably around the right level. That doesn’t mean spitting out a few words here and there, but speaking in full sentences without feeling out of breath. If you find yourself stopping to catch your breath or if you feel like you need to take break, you’re going too hard. (That said, some of zone 3 is also within that conversational zone, but it's okay—zone 3 is still good for you.)\n\nThat said, it shouldn’t feel too easy—zone 2 is more like a brisk walk or easy jog than a leisurely stroll. If you stop, you should feel like you took a break from something. It should take a little work and focus to keep up the pace.\n\nBefore you start, there's a big caveat. Zone 2 is based on heart rate zones, and to set your zones correctly, you need an accurate max heart rate. Finding your max is a trickier task than you might expect, so you have my permission to skip this section completely, and scroll down to \"How do you know when you're in zone 2?\" which will teach you how to get into zone 2 by feel, no heart rate monitor needed.\n\nWith that out of the way, I'll explain how exactly to find your zone 2, if you want to do it by the book. There are two steps: finding your max heart rate, and then setting your zones based on that heart rate.\n\nYour maximum heart rate is defined as, literally, the fastest your heart can beat. (Sometimes people assume this is a guideline, that you should keep your heart rate under this number. Nope—if your heart rate is higher than the number you thought was your max, that just tells you that number was not your max.) Here are some different ways to find your max heart rate:\n\nA max heart rate field test (best for people with healthy hearts and some pain tolerance): There are a few ways of doing this, but basically you're going to try to push your heart rate to its absolute max, and see what that number is. The most common way is to find a long, steep hill, and run up it three times, really sprinting hard on the last one. The number you see at the end is a good estimate of your max. Obviously, don't do this if you've been told you shouldn't exercise at high intensity.\n\nYour personal history (best for athletes who have experience using a HR monitor): If you've done high intensity exercise in the past, especially killer efforts that left you collapsed on the floor, the highest number you've ever seen on your watch or heart rate monitor is probably your max, or close to it. A 5K race or an FTP test will often get you close, if you really pushed yourself the whole way.\n\nEstimating based on easy exercise (best for non-athletes who have experience using a HR monitor): If you have a sense of what heart rate you see when you're exercising at a steady, conversational pace, multiply the highest number you would consider conversational by 1.25 to find a number that you can use as your max. This is my own method, but it's based on studies that have found the top of conversational pace to be around 77-79% of max. This isn't as good as a field test, but for many people it will give a better result than the formula below.\n\nA formula. I don't recommend using a formula if you have the option of using either of the first two real-world options above. Using a formula to get your max heart rate is like asking ChatGPT for your shoe size. It will give a plausible guess, but it could easily be very, very wrong. Anyway, the easiest formula is to subtract your age from 220. (There are other formulas, but honestly they all have serious inaccuracies. I wouldn't worry about whether any one of them is \"better\" than the others. They all suck.)\n\nI have more here on why max heart rate formulas are pretty much all wrong, but that's beside the point for the moment. If you know your max heart rate, you can proceed to the next step.\n\nOnce you know your max heart rate (or have an estimate you're willing to work with), multiply to get the upper and lower boundaries of zone 2. Multiply by what? Well, there's more than one opinion out there about what zone 2 should be.\n\nIf you use a smartwatch or other device, go into the settings and set a custom heart rate (all the major brands can do this—check the instructions to find out where this setting lives.) The zones will usually populate automatically.\n\nAs I've written before, every device has a different idea of what should count as zone 2. If you'd like me to be the tiebreaker, I'd go with 60% to 75% of your max heart rate. So, multiply your estimated max heart rate by 0.6 to get the lower end of that zone, and 0.75 to get the higher end. For example, if your max heart rate is 200, your zone 2 is 120 to 150 beats per minute. If your max heart rate is 175, your zone 2 would be 105 to 132.\n\nI have good news for you: zone 3 has almost all the same benefits as zone 2. Don't view the top of zone 2 as a barrier thou shalt not cross; it's just a way of dividing easier exercise (zone 2) from medium intensity (zone 3). The more exercise you do, the more of it should stay in zone 2. Otherwise you could find yourself building up fatigue. After a zone 2 cardio session, you should feel good. You should feel like you totally could have done more, but you're saving some energy for tomorrow.\n\nSo if you have a hard time staying in zone 2, don't beat yourself up about it. Just try to keep your effort level low, on average, so you're still fresh for the next workout. As you get fitter, you'll find it easier to stay in zone 2.\n\nRunners often have trouble with this, because the dividing line between walking and running is sometimes too high to maintain an easy pace while you’re running, if you’re a beginner. The next best thing is to jog as slow as you can, and when you start to feel out of breath, switch to a brisk walk. For some people, a brisk walk for the whole session is a perfect zone 2 workout. As you get more fit, easy jogging will become possible.\n\nHere’s a real world example of how to keep a zone 2 pace: if I’m heading out for an easy run, I start at a nice chill jogging pace. But I live in a hilly neighborhood, so pretty soon I’ll be chugging up a hill and notice my breathing getting heavier. At this point, if my heart rate is getting higher than I'd like for this workout, I switch to a power walk. Jogging the flats and walking the uphills is a great way to keep your effort level steady, instead of accidentally turning your easy jog into a hill sprint workout.\n\nCyclists often measure their training in a seven-zone system that is based on how much power, in a physics sense, you are putting into the gears of your bike. These are called Coggan power zones, and bike training systems like Zwift and Peloton use the same basic idea. To calibrate these zones, you’ll take an FTP (functional threshold power) test—basically, a 20-minute race against yourself. From there, you (or your training app) calculates wattage numbers for your zones.\n\nZones 2 and 3 in this system usually correspond to our “zone 2” cardio. (Your heart rate at the end of an FTP test will be pretty close to your max heart rate, by the way, if you really went all-out.) If you train with both a heart rate monitor and a bike power meter, don’t worry if they don’t match exactly. A ride in power zones 2 and 3 will meet your low-intensity cardio needs, even if your heart rate starts in zone 1 and spikes into zone 3 by the end.\n\nFor other forms of cardio, go by feel, or by heart rate if you truly know your heart rate percentages. When you’re on the elliptical or the rower or the airbike, you should feel like you could carry on a conversation easily, and stop because time is up rather than because you’re running out of gas.",

Here's how threat actors are hijacking WhatsApp accounts—and how to defend yours.\n\nWhatsApp allows users to link their desktop or browser to their account without needing to enter login credentials in one of two ways: scanning a QR code and approving the session or confirming a numeric pairing code in the mobile app. While the GhostPairing scam could theoretically manipulate users in either approach, researchers found that the latter is much more common.\n\nThe fraud begins with a short message sent from a contact with a link that purportedly goes to a Facebook photo or some type of Facebook content. If you click through, you'll be directed to a spoofed Facebook login page to enter your phone number—a familiar confirmation flow for Meta platforms. The next screen will likely show a numeric code with instructions to enter said code into WhatsApp to confirm the login (again, this may feel like a familiar two-step verification). If you're not paying attention, you may not realize that this didn't do anything on your end but instead registered the attacker's browser as a linked device to your account.\n\nThe danger in this scam is that everything will seem normal on your device and in your account, as attackers haven't hijacked your credentials to lock you out. However, they can do anything and everything in WhatsApp that you can, such as reading chats, receiving messages, viewing and downloading media, collecting information from your contacts, and forwarding the same phishing link. As they learn more about you and the people you know, they can potentially use that for ongoing scams.\n\nAs always, be wary of links received via messaging platforms, even if they seem harmless or you think you know and can trust the sender. Threat actors frequently use social media and direct messaging to spread phishing lures. If you do click a link in WhatsApp (or any other communication), read all prompts carefully before providing or verifying any information to identify scams.\n\nTo protect your WhatsApp account specifically, you can set up two-step verification, which will also prevent attackers from adding or changing a connected email address. Go to Settings > Account > Two-step verification > Turn on or Set up PIN and add an email address when prompted. You can also check to see if there are any suspicious devices paired with your account under Settings > Linked devices and remove any you don't recognize or regularly use.\n\nFinally, if you have been targeted by this scam, let your WhatsApp contacts know, as threat actors may spread the malicious link by making it look like it came from you.",

They lost Kai Havertz from the opening day, while captain Martin Odegaard and Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Martinelli, Noni Madueke and Max Dowman have had spells on the sidelines.\n\nNow, after injuries mainly affecting attacking players, it is the Arsenal backline which is suffering.\n\nArteta was forced to play Declan Rice in an unfamiliar right-back position against Brighton on Saturday because Jurrien Timber was injured and Riccardo Calafiori picked up an issue in the warm-up.\n\nGabriel returned from injury in the 2-1 win, but the return dates of Cristhian Mosquera, Timber and Calafiori are not known.\n\n\"We're going to be really aware of the situation and the timescale of certain players,\" Arteta said.\n\n\"We have to be actively looking, and then can we do it or not?\n\n\"That's a different story, but our job is to be always very prepared because something can happen.\"",

Whichever way you look at it, it's a foul.\"\n\nThe VAR checked the goal but allowed Jones' on-field decision to stand. Defeat left Forest five points above the Premier League's relegation zone.\n\nThe PGMOL has previously played audio privately to clubs - including Forest - while PGMOL chief refereeing officer Howard Webb also discusses incidents on the Mic'd Up programme.",
