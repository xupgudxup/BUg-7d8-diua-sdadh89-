    "fullText": "Finding the best fits for mid-round quarterbacks in the 2026 NFL Draft originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe story of the 2026 NFL Draft's quarterback class will be defined by its thinning at the top. Fernando Mendoza is the odds-on favorite to go 1.01. If he declares, Oregon's Dante Moore shouldn't last much longer. But this isn't the class the football world was sold, and teams' actions early in the offseason will reflect that.\n\nInstead, we are left with an unsteady crop of quarterbacks, many of whom decided to return to school. The seniors that aren't afforded that option are headed to the league with less hype than the summer suggested and little expectations of rookie-year playing time.\n\nIn an NFL era that has rendered the Day 2 quarterback an endangered species, several passers may fall into Day 3. While that has consequences for their rookie contracts, it could also open the door for more competitive teams offering a promising path to development.\n\nGarrett Nussmeier, LSU: Arizona Cardinals\n\nA Day 2 option that I've penciled into prior mock drafts is Nussmeier heading to the desert. It may not come as early as initially anticipated, but there's reason to believe that both parties could benefit from a fresh start.\n\nKyler Murray has proven he isn't the answer in Arizona. He may return for one last stand, but at some point, the Cardinals will need a new option under center. Unlike the out-of-structure prowess that Murray enjoys, Nussmeier projects more like a game manager. Similar to Jacoby Brissett, Nussmeier can win pre-snap and run the offense as it's intended, opening up the middle of the field and feeding receivers with more consistent targets.\n\nThe Cardinals prefer Brissett's style to Murray. Opting for Nussmeier provides a similar skill set with more credibility as a long-term option.\n\nNussmeier dealt with an injury to his midsection and wasn't quite as polished in 2025. As the floor drops on his stock, Arizona can take a shot on a new passer without wasting resources on a potential first-round prospect in 2027.\n\nJohn Mateer, Oklahoma: Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n\nThe Buccaneers have been beneficiaries of Baker Mayfield's career resurgence. Unfortunately for Tampa, his step back has left them closer to quarterback purgatory than they would like to admit.\n\nI'm lower than most on Mayfield, but this isn't an indictment on his status as next year's quarterback. He'll likely return and do so with the optimism of a healthier squad (and probably a new head coach). We know that this offense can work around Mayfield's measurable shortcomings, and living with his volatility has been a welcome part of the experience. Thus, a pivot to Mateer in April makes sense.\n\nMORE: Cole Payton gives Senior Bowl a small-school boost at quarterback\n\nMateer wouldn't start right away, but his similarities to Mayfield make him a viable backup in this offense and provide the Buccaneers with an off-ramp if contract talks get messy.\n\nMateer needs development before he starts on Sundays. He's more comfortable out of structure than inside it, draws pressure on himself in the pocket, and can be too reliant on his legs. Still, that mobility should amplify a below-average backfield in ways that Mayfield's scrambling has not.\n\nAt Oklahoma, Mateer's play style and moxie made him the Sooners' spiritual successor to Mayfield. He could have a similar opportunity in a perpetually-winnable NFC South.\n\nCarson Beck, Miami: Indianapolis Colts\n\nIndianapolis has created a special kind of catastrophe. Daniel Jones seems likely to return, albeit off an Achilles and not necessarily ready for Week 1. With limited mobility, he's a tough passer to trust. An orbital fracture further curtailed Anthony Richardson's development. I don't know what the Year 4 version of him looks like, and after his historically poor performances in 2024, I'm not sure I (nor Shane Steichen) want to find out.\n\nThe Colts don't have the ammo to take an early-round passer, either. This is a room that, as currently constructed, has one of the lowest floors in football.\n\nIndianapolis needs a polished passer who can keep Steichen's offense on the tracks and do enough for the ground game to churn out victories. Early on Day 3, Miami's Carson Beck might be the best bet to do so.\n\nDespite flashing early in the year (and entering the 2025 cycle as the preseason QB1), Beck profiles as a backup who has more present-day competence than long-term upside. He's played a lot of college ball against premium competition and has enough tools to trust with playing time. Throw in the allure of Steichen's wizardry and squint hard enough, and Beck is a low-risk dice roll of getting the Colts out of this mess.\n\nDrew Allar, Penn State: Detroit Lions\n\nIt was a nightmare season for everyone in Happy Valley, none more than Drew Allar.\n\nOnce a first-round hopeful, Allar began the cycle as a Day 2 option with enough upside to get Round 1 looks. He struggled in 2025, and an ankle injury ended his college career.\n\nThere is significant uncertainty in this profile. His broken ankle could dampen his athleticism, limit a skill-set that wasn't particularly twitchy, or keep him from getting crucial reps for his intangible development. He could also be fine! But no longer is Allar a polarizing passer for teams to take at a discount.\n\nAllar never proved he could cash in on his elite physical traits, even with Penn State's army of top recruits. Now, he enters the league without a real platform year and injury concerns headlining his profile.\n\nAllar needs to land on a team with a strong offensive infrastructure and no demand to play in Year 1. Few teams check those boxes like the Detroit Lions. Jared Goff isn't going anywhere anytime soon, and it doesn't make sense to move him until after the 2026 season, regardless of his performance.\n\nYet, the Lions' window is closing fast, and as Super Bowl aspirations shrink, patience for Goff will follow. There's a world in which the 2027 Lions are led by another quarterback, leaving at least one season for Allar to get healthy and develop in the incubator of Detroit's offense. Armed with an elite ground game, quality receivers, and a good young coach, Allar makes about as much sense on paper as a Day 3 project can get.\n\nCole Payton, North Dakota State: Carolina Panthers\n\nThere's a fog of war that comes with evaluating NDSU talents. The talent gap between the Bison and their competition is as fierce as any in college football, and their NFL quarterbacks have reflected that uncertainty. Carson Wentz was an MVP favorite who quickly became a castaway. Easton Stick never stuck, and Trey Lance will start in Week 18 on his third team in as many years.\n\nPayton doesn't have to follow any of those paths, but the pre-draft circuit will be crucial in selling himself to NFL evaluators.\n\nThe Panthers can't get away with drafting a quarterback in Round 1, especially if they win in Week 18 and get to host a playoff game. That doesn't change their circumstances under center, where Young has taken a bumpy road to below average.\n\nEventually, Carolina will look to move off of Young and the limitations of being the league's shortest passer. Payton offers an imposing frame as a rusher and surplus arm talent, earning him some looks as a potential starter. Sitting behind Young gives him a chance to learn under quarterback guru Dave Canales, and if he gets a chance to play, that same volatility could serve the Panthers well.\n\nIf Payton starts and plays well, Carolina can strike gold and justify moving on from Young. If the jump from NDSU to the NFL is too large for Payton to clear, he might be bad enough to get the Panthers a top pick. In either scenario, he's unlikely to set the career mark for lowest yards per completion, unlike Carolina's current quarterback.\n\nEmmett Johnson scouting report: Nebraska's back makes case for RB2\n\nTop prospects the Kansas City Chiefs can pick after Patrick Mahomes' injury\n\nArch Manning's NFL Draft decision means doubling down on Texas\n\nLaNorris Sellers' 2026 NFL Draft decision leaves more questions than answers",

The Athletic’s James L. Edwards III broke down Hart’s lower-body setback on Saturday.\n\n“New York Knicks do-it-all guard Josh Hart will miss at least the next three games with a right sprained ankle,” Edwards reported.\n\n“Hart suffered the injury in the fourth quarter of New York’s Christmas Day victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers.”\n\n“Hart, per league sources, is still undergoing further tests and will be reevaluated when the Knicks return from a three-game road trip that begins against the Atlanta Hawks on Saturday and ends with the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday.”\n\nThere’s no question it’ll be difficult for the Knicks to be the best version of themselves without Hart in the lineup.\n\nThe Villanova product is among the best rebounding guards in the league, always plays under control, is an underrated downhill attacker, and is a much-improved perimeter shooting threat.\n\nHart is averaging 12.3 points, 8.0 rebounds, and 5.1 assists per game with New York this season, shooting 49.8% from the field and 38.9% from beyond the arc.\n\nHopefully, Hart isn’t sidelined for an extended period.\n\nMore NBA: Golf could play surprising factor in Lakers' LeBron James' retirement decision",

Gonzalez/Gowens 18%, Gordon 14%, Batista/Cerela 7%, Diaz/Hodge/Mogollón/Ziehl 4%)\n\nAldrin Batista\nRight-Handed Starting Pitcher\nAge 22\n2025 SSS Prospect Poll ranking 6\n2025 high level Winston-Salem (High-A)\nAge relative to high level -1.2 years\nOverall 2025 stats 2-0 ▪️ 7 games (2 starts) ▪️ 14 IP ▪️ 5.79 ERA ▪️ 17 K ▪️ 7 BB ▪️ 1.429 WHIP ▪️-1.2 WAR\n\nBatista was our No. 6-voted player in last year’s poll and top righthander — and then disaster struck, as he started the third Dash game of the season on April 6 and then was out more than four months with a stress fracture in his right (pitching) elbow. His return in late August was iffy, with three poor relief appearances of five. But he ended the season with a scoreless (two-inning) “opener” start, which hopefully reverses the curse for 2026.\n\nJuan Carela\nRight-Handed Starting Pitcher\nAge 24\n2024 High Level Birmingham (AA)\nAge relative to high level -2.5 years\nOverall 2024 MiLB stats (High-A/AA) 7-7▪️ 23 starts ▪️ 106 2⁄3 IP ▪️ 3.77 ERA ▪️ 114 K▪️ 45 BB ▪️ 1.238 WHIP ▪️ 1.5 WAR\n\nCarela has mostly flown under the radar since being acquired from the Yankees in at the 2023 trade deadline. But he has forced his way into an increasingly crowded rotation situation at this point, punctuated by seven brilliant starts for Birmingham to end the 2024 season yielding a 3.58 ERA and 1.163 WHIP while being well underage for the level. Just as Carela was moving closer to Charlotte and/or possible MLB appearances, he blew out his arm last March and underwent TJS.\n\nReudis Diaz\nRight-handed relief pitcher\nAge 20\n2025 high level ACL (Rookie)\nAge relative to high level -2.1 years\nOverall 2025 stats 1-1 ▪️ 1 SV▪️ 21 games (4 finishes) ▪️ 27 2/3 IP ▪️ 2.28.ERA ▪️ 18 K ▪️ 8 BB ▪️ 1.084 WHIP ▪️1.2 WAR\n\nWho? You’re forgiven for being unfamiliar with an extremely young arm who hasn’t yet gotten out of rookie ball, but our No. 77 prospect a year ago (then a starter, repeating the DSL and killing it) made a successful adjustment Stateside. He’ll return to starting in 2026, likely getting his feet wet in Arizona and getting a promotion to Low-A in the second half of the season.\n\nJacob Gonzalez\nSecond Baseman\nAge 23\n2024 SSS Prospect Poll ranking 9\n2025 SSS Prospect Poll ranking 24\n2025 high level Charlotte (AAA)\nAge relative to high level -3.3 years\nOverall 2025 stats (AA/AAA) 134 games ▪️ 8 HR ▪️ 61 RBI ▪️ .232/.307/.345 ▪️ 17-of-20 (85.0%) SB ▪️ 48 BB ▪️ 86 K ▪️ .990 FLD%▪️ 3.1 WAR\n\nAfter the incredible first half/awful second of 2024, Gonzalez rebounded for a solid campaign, the final third of which came in Charlotte. However, his time in Charlotte, a hitter’s playground, was a significant step back on offense. He’s on the cusp of the bigs but has created questions whether he’ll produce at all with the stick on the South Side.\n\nLucas Gordon\nLeft-Handed Starting Pitcher\nAge 24\n2025 high level Birmingham (AA)\nAge relative to high level -1.7 years\nOverall 2025 stats (High-A/AA) 3-11▪️ 24 starts ▪️ 107 2/3 IP ▪️ 3.59 ERA ▪️ 116 K ▪️ 42 BB ▪️ 1.161 WHIP ▪️ 1.5 WAR\n\nSomehow still, in completing his third season as a pro, Gordon is still vastly underrated. All he has done is put up a career 2.80 ERA while taking on a significant workload each season. Sure, there’s no overpowering fastball there, but Gordon’s cup of coffee at Double-A (where he vastly improved his ERA, 2.11 over four starts) indicates that he may evade the wall that softer tossers hit once they are in the upper minors.\n\nRiley Gowens\nRight-Handed Starting Pitcher\nAge 26\n2025 high level Birmingham (AA)\nAge relative to high level +0.3 years\nOverall 2025 stats 7-6▪️ 27 starts ▪️ 132 IP ▪️ 3.44 ERA ▪️ 151 K ▪️ 49 BB ▪️ 1.189 WHIP ▪️ 2.0 WAR\n\n“Workhorse” is not the sexiest attribute for a prospect, but it’s no chopped liver adjective, either. And Gowens is just that, topping system starters with 27 starts, 132 innings and 151 Ks. And yet somehow he has evaded the praise handed to 2025 wunderkind Tanner McDougal, despite some obvious similarities. He should get the call to Charlotte to start 2026 and be on the short list, alongside McDougal, for first call-up for a start in the majors.\n\nLandon Hodge\nCatcher\nAge 19\n2025 high level Crespi Carmelite H.S. (Encino, Calif.)\nScouting grades (40-80 scale) Hit 45 ▪️ Power 40 ▪️ Run 50 ▪️ Arm 55 ▪️ Field 50 ▪️ Overall 40\n\nThis teammate of White Sox first-rounder (and SSS Top Prospect Vote No. 7 player) Billy Carlson made history simply by being drafted (fourth round, No. 107 overall). The very first pick of Day 2 of the draft was a somewhat curious one, given MLB’s ranking as the 164th-best talent available in the draft and the presence of much more enticing talents (as high as MLB’s No. 35 prospect) passed over on Day 1. Hodge has a killer arm (another characteristic he shares with Carlson) and has a solid hit tool that’s more average than power.\n\nJavier Mogollón\nShortstop\nAge 20\n2025 high level Kannapolis (Low-A)\nAge relative to high level -1.4 years\nOverall 2025 stats 51 games ▪️ 5 HR ▪️ 19 RBI ▪️ .220/.347/.387 ▪️ 15-of-21 (71.4%) SB ▪️ 30 BB ▪️ 56 K ▪️ .971 FLD%▪️ 1.0 WAR\n\nAn ascending star just one year ago, we have to tap the breaks a bit on Mogollón after a lackluster first full season of minors ball. While still young for his level and managing to keep his head above water in a new league every season of his career, Mogollón’s undeniable hitting in Rookie ball fell off significantly with the Cannon Ballers. However, how much of that was due to battling injury is undetermined, as Mogollón was shelved for what turned out to be the season on July 2.\n\nRikuu Nishida\nRight Fielder\nAge 24\n2025 SSS Prospect Poll ranking 28 \n2025 high level Birmingham (AA)\nAge relative to high level +0.3 years\nOverall 2025 stats 115 games ▪️ 0 HR ▪️ 31 RBI ▪️ .273/.403/.308 ▪️ 40-of-52 (76.9%) SB ▪️ 75 BB ▪️ 69 K ▪️ .986 FLD%▪️ 2.6 WAR\n\nWhat other testament to Nishida’s flexibility can there be but to say in three years in our Top 100, his primary position has changed from left field to second base to right field. You won’t find a stranger profile in the White Sox system, as Nishida’s profile is one of extreme on-base ability and baserunning peskiness, at the expense of any power whatsoever. He was a seeming shoo-in for Charlotte at some point last summer, but stalled in Double-A.\n\nTyler Schweitzer\nLeft-Handed Starting Pitcher\nAge 25\n2025 high level Charlotte (AAA)\nAge relative to high level -3.3 years\nOverall 2025 stats (AA/AAA) 8-2 ▪️ 27 games (10 starts) ▪️ 99 2/3 IP ▪️4.61 ERA ▪️ 81 K ▪️ 41 BB ▪️ 1.344 WHIP ▪️ 0.8 WAR\n\nSchweitzer relieved in most of his games in 2025, but he remains a starter in our eyes given he was consistently paired with Tanner McDougal in Birmingham Barons starts. And in Birmingham, Schweitzer was divine: 1.27 ERA that included a long scoreless streak leading to a Charlotte promotion, 0.946 WHIP. However, everything the southpaw did as a Baron, he undid as a Knight (7.92 ERA, 1.740 ERA). While other gilded arms (Drew Thorpe, Grant Taylor) get to skip Charlotte entirely, Schweitzer was not so lucky. And that luck could prevent him from ever seeing the majors.\n\nGage Ziehl\nRight-Handed Starting Pitcher\nAge 22\n2025 high level Somerset (Yankees AA)\nAge relative to high level -2.7 years\nOverall 2025 stats (Low-A/High-A/AA) 7-6 ▪️ 22 games (21 starts, 1 finish) ▪️ 107 IP ▪️4.12 ERA ▪️ 90 K ▪️ 19 BB ▪️ 1.262 WHIP ▪️ 1.4 WAR\n\nZiehl was the return from the Yankees in the trade deadline swap of Austin Slater, and based on the nothing value of Slater this trade can’t possibly be a loss for the White Sox. The righty was a busy arm even before the trade, pitching at three levels for New York and settling at High-A for the White Sox. Pitching young for his level, Ziehl held his own pretty well.\n\nPast South Side Sox Prospect votes\n\nHere is how 2018 wrangled out — all 42 picks.

    "description": "Colorado quarterback Ryan Staub plans to enter the NCAA transfer portal following three years with the Buffaloes, On3 has learned.",
    "fullText": "One of Colorado‘s quarterbacks plans to enter the NCAA transfer portal. Ryan Staub, a redshirt sophomore, intends to enter on Jan. 2 when the portal opens, per On3’s Hayes Fawcett.\n\nStaub has played relatively sparingly for the Buffaloes over the past three seasons. He initially saw some playing time as a freshman in 2023, before he failed to complete a pass the following year.\n\nRyan Staub went 23-of-40 passing for 254 yards and a touchdown as a freshman in 2023, showing some promise. Of course, Colorado was relatively set at quarterback already with Shedeur Sanders taking over and eventually turning into an NFL Draft pick at the position.\n\nBecause Sanders had such a stranglehold on the job in 2023 and 2024, Staub threw just four passes as a redshirt freshman in 2024. He did not complete any of them, and he was sacked once.\n\nIn 2025, with Sanders off to the NFL, Ryan Staub some some limited work. His biggest set of action came in early September, when he played in games against Delaware and at Houston. In the Houston game, Staub went 19-of-35 passing for 204 yards and a touchdown. However, he was picked off twice. He also ran 11 times for 36 yards, showing some decent mobility.\n\nBut Staub would throw only 10 passes the rest of the season. He finished the year 30-of-55 passing for 427 yards, with three touchdowns and four interceptions. He also ran for one score.\n\nPrior to enrolling at Colorado, Ryan Staub was ranked as a three-star prospect and the No. 733 overall player in the 2023 class, according to the On3 Consensus. He also checked in as the No. 39 quarterback in the class and the No. 63 overall player from the state of California, hailing from Stevenson Ranch (CA) West Ranch.\n\nStaub figures to generate some interest in the transfer portal. He’s a quarterback who has seen some action in a major power conference game.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nBaltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson is still in doubt for the Week 18 winner-take-all game against the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nHaving suffered a back injury in the loss to the New England Patriots, it has been the Tyler Huntley show for Baltimore, as he led a stirring 41-24 win over the Green Bay Packers in Week 17.\n\nBut now that the AFC North and Baltimore's entire season are effectively on the line, the franchise will want to have the two-time MVP winner on the field.\n\nBut going by John Harbaugh's comments on Monday, that is far from a sure thing.\n\n\"Well, it's to be determined,\" Harbaugh said. \"He's coming off a very serious injury, and he's working at it.

    "description": "Utah Jazz forward has a chance to get his second All-Star bid in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Lauri Markkanen has a chance to make the 2026 NBA All-Star team.\n\nThe Utah Jazz forward was in the Western Conference’s top 20 in the first returns from All-Star fan voting. He came in at 16th in the West with just over 112,000 votes.\n\nWhile the top vote getters have already racked up more than 1 million fan votes, that doesn’t mean Markkanen is out of the running to make a team.\n\nThis year, as in years past, there will be 24 total All-Stars (12 from each conference) selected. But, there are two key differences to this year’s All-Star team format. This year, All-Stars will be selected without regard to position, so no more worrying about having a certain number of backcourt or frontcourt players.\n\nAlso, this year there will be three All-Star teams made up of a minimum of eight players. There will be two U.S. teams and one World team made up of international players.\n\nLuka Dončić and Giannis Antetokounmpo lead their conferences in the first fan returns in NBA All-Star Voting 2026.\n\nFans (50% of the vote) join NBA players (25%) and a media panel (25%) in selecting five players in each conference honored as starters.\n\nNext fan update: 1/6. pic.twitter.com/pHykl9yhTE\n\n— NBA Communications (@NBAPR) December 29, 2025\n\nThe five All-Star starters from each conference are determind by fans (50% of the vote), current NBA players (25%) and media votes (25%). Seven reserves for each conference are selected by NBA head coaches.\n\nAs the voting returns stand, Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Victor Wembanyama and Giannis Antetokounmpo will be easy top choices for the World team. So it looks like Markkanen will be competing for a reserve spot with Portland’s Deni Avdija, Houston’s Alperen Sengun, New York’s Karl Anthony-Towns, Indiana’s Pascal Siakam, Denver’s Jamal Murray and Chicago’s Josh Giddey.\n\nThrough 27 games played this season, Markkanen is averaging 27.9 points and 6.9 rebounds per game, while shooting 47.6% overall, 36.7% from 3-point range and 90.3% from the free-throw line. He made his first All-Star appearance in 2023, when he was an All-Star starter in the game that was hosted in Utah.",

    "fullText": "Ravens fans will love John Harbaugh's quote on AFC North title in Week 18 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nMake no mistake, the Baltimore Ravens know precisely what is in front of them on Sunday night.\n\nAfter a season that could be best described as a yo-yo, the Ravens will enter the final week of the regular season with everything to play for.\n\nA road trip to face the Pittsburgh Steelers. Win, and you claim the division and a playoff spot.\n\nLose, and your season ends at the hands of your bitter rival.\n\nSuccess in the NFL isn't linear, and John Harbaugh is ready to walk down this path with his players on Sunday night.\n\n“It's a great opportunity, we'll be playing a division championship game on Sunday,\" Harbaugh said. \"That's what we're doing in last week of the season. We're excited about that, it's a meaningful thing, we've worked hard to get to this position.\n\n\"There's a lot of different paths in football, and there's a lot of different paths in life, and this is the path of the 2025 season. So, here we are and our goal is to make the most of it.\"\n\nMore:Will Lamar Jackson play in Week 18? Ravens give concerning update on injured QB\n\nRight now, that seems like a distinct possibility.\n\nWith Harbaugh stating that Lamar's starting status is still being determined and that Wednesday will offer more clarity, Huntley's starting status is very much in play.\n\nAfter his exploits in the 41-24 win over the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field (16 of 20 for 107 yards, 1 TD, 60 rushing yards), it is clear the Ravens will be happy to go into the game with Tyler.\n\nStill, having a two-time MVP winner is a better option, but if Lamar isn't 100 percent healthy, will Baltimore risk it?\n\nWith Huntley in this form, I don't think they have to.\n\nDerrick Henry accomplishes feat at Lambeau Field never done in NFL history\n\nDerrick Henry breaks NFL record previously shared with Adrian Peterson, O.J. Simpson\n\nDerrick Henry stats today: Ravens RB carries load in must-win game vs. Packers\n\nWhat Ravens' win vs. Packers means for AFC North, wild-card standings",

    "description": "Imagine the world as you know it. Now, add 10 million people who care about birds. Did your world just get a little brighter?",
    "fullText": "Imagine the world as you know it. Now, add 10 million people who care about birds. Did your world just get a little brighter?\n\nTen million. It’s an astronomical number. And yet that is exactly what Merlin, the free bird ID app developed by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, has accomplished since launching in 2014. Ten million active users the world over, from experts in the field to neophytes who let the app run in the background during their morning routine—and they’re turning enthusiasm and newfound joy into participatory science that helps protect birds and biodiversity.\n\nFrom Serbia: “It is my honor and pleasure that 165 of my photos were used to train Merlin to identify birds.”\n\nFrom Costa Rica: “Great for beginners. It motivates you to keep expanding your life list.”\n\nFrom India: “The app is so user-friendly…you can know about a lot of birds around you based on the pictures and their calls.”\n\nFrom the U.S.: “My four-year-old daughter and I were using Merlin to identify about 12 birds in our backyard. My daughter said to me, Daddy, your phone is magical. I’ve been programming for over 40 years. Merlin amazes me too.”\n\nSo how is it that millions of people now hold this magic in their pockets? To satisfy that question, we have to go back nearly two decades when the Lab’s idea for a bird ID app first hatched.\n\nThe year was 2008 and the Cornell Lab wanted to expand the capability of its online guide, All About Birds. According to Miyoko Chu, senior director of Science Communications at the Lab, users wanted more than the site could provide. “When we looked at analytics, we saw a lot of people typing in phrases like little brown bird. It became clear they were trying to use our website as a bird ID tool.”\n\nWhen we looked at analytics, we saw a lot of people typing in phrases like little brown bird. It became clear they were trying to use our website as a bird ID tool.\n\nIn the aftermath of the financial crisis, the Lab didn’t have capacity to reimagine All About Birds. These were the early days of broad-based artificial intelligence, so the team brainstormed a game of 20 questions that would utilize machine learning to produce a positive bird ID and proposed it to the National Science Foundation. “The heart of the proposal,” says Miyoko, “was the power of a bird’s name. If you see something and you don’t know its name, it’s really hard to learn more. But as soon as you can call it a Yellow Warbler, you’ve got all the information in the world at your fingertips.”\n\nAfter winning the NSF grant, the team needed to figure out how to teach the machine-learning model how to identify birds. Jessie Barry, who now leads the Merlin program through the Lab’s Macaulay Library, cites AI as the reason the project was funded, but concedes that the initial machine-learning task didn’t work all that well. “We didn’t have enough data,” says Jessie. Meanwhile, the team discovered a faster solution: the power of eBird data.\n\nIn the early 2010s, eBird, the Lab’s worldwide bird observation platform, was taking off. Tens of thousands of birdwatchers had already contributed millions of sightings, and their observations added two crucial factors: time of year and location. This meant that instead of trying to guess among, say, 800 species, eBird could help narrow it down to the few dozen species a person would most likely see. With just three more questions, it presented an answer. With time and location in hand, the team was able to compress the initial 20 questions into a simple five-question rubric to identify birds.\n\nHalfway through development, the team met another “grant”—Grant Van Horn, an undergrad at UCSD knocking on doors and looking for professors to work with. He had joined Caltech’s Visipedia project aimed at training computers to recognize objects in photos, using machine learning. To source the photos, they looked to Flickr, the world’s largest photo-sharing site at the time. According to Grant, “Flickr’s top photos of the day were some landscapes, a few portraits of people, and, inevitably, birds.”\n\nThe question quickly became: Can we train a computer to recognize all these bird photos?\n\n“The Visipedia team had scraped the web to build this dataset,” says Jessie, “but many of the birds were misidentified.” In a spirit of sharing and collaboration, the teams partnered to build a robust and accurate archive of images. As Jessie remembers it, “We approached a bunch of friends to get their photos off Flickr as a way to build the dataset.” By 2010, they’d collected enough images to have a basic working model. According to Jessie, “We were thinking, okay, 25% of the time, maybe this pre-Merlin system could identify a bird accurately.”\n\nAnother breakthrough came when the team realized they could build out Macaulay’s image archive by enabling eBirders to upload photos directly into the Macaulay Library as a part of their checklists. It has become a virtuous cycle; as birders share more images, the results get more accurate. Today, Macaulay’s archive is an asset that simply can’t be replicated anywhere else. On average, eBird users contribute an image every two seconds, and the accuracy of Merlin’s visual ID hovers around 98%.\n\n“By the way,” Miyoko adds, “this was almost not funded. Some of the NSF reviewers were quite skeptical, asking, How is this teaching anyone? It’s basically doing all the work for people, you’re just giving them the answer.”\n\nWhat impact would this new app have on the world of birding? Or, for that matter, on how people learn?\n\nWhere did the name Merlin come from? Miyoko remembers flipping through names of birds and coming to rest on the Merlin, a falcon that is both small and fierce. Merlin populations declined in the 20th century due to DDT and other pesticides, but bounced back once those were banned. Of course, Merlin also refers to the mythical sorcerer in King Arthur’s court. “We’d always talked about it being this magical experience where you would be so surprised that this name could pop up and give you the answer you were looking for,” says Miyoko. The team rallied around the name and began making final preparations for the app’s release.\n\nOn average, eBird users contribute an image every two seconds, and the accuracy of Merlin’s visual ID hovers around 98%.\n\nWith the NSF grant nearing its end, a fork in the road came when it was time to decide what to charge for Merlin. Alex Chang, who was leading the team’s web communications, says, “At that time, companies were selling their apps for $1, and it was moving toward $2.” But the Lab wanted to build a community, not just revenue. So Alex, who was also pursuing an MBA at Cornell at the time, wrote a business case showing that it was more valuable to offer Merlin for free in exchange for an email address.\n\nThat decision led to far more downloads, including in countries where any fee might be a significant barrier. It also gave the Lab a channel to connect with its users. Today, Merlin is at the heart of rapid growth in the number of participants and supporters of Lab programs, which has helped transform the scale of the Lab’s global conservation work. Merlin has become the Lab’s front door.\n\nThe app launched in 2014 with the ability to ID 285 species—just the most common backyard birds in North America—using the five-question rubric Jessie’s team developed . In 2015, Drew Weber joined the team to broaden Merlin’s geographic footprint. Drew is now the project manager on the Merlin team, and has helped expand Merlin to include 11,000 species, nearly every known bird in the world. When he comes through customs after an international birding trip, the agents get excited when he tells them what he does for a living. “We love Merlin,” they say.\n\n“Merlin is a wide funnel that brings people into the world of birds,” Drew says. “Some of those folks are going to download eBird and start collecting data. Some of them are going to start caring about birds and give money to protect their habitats. But for many others, Merlin simply lets them start to recognize and enjoy the birds around them in a way that wouldn’t have happened otherwise.”\n\nSusan Fox Rogers, author of Learning the Birds, agrees. “Merlin changed everything. This is something to celebrate in every possible way.” Susan started birding at age 49. “When I first went out, I couldn’t do it by myself. I needed the John Burroughs club, I needed to get to a baseline. It took two or three years, maybe 20 trips.” It used to be that to become an expert, you had to learn from another expert. But for millions of learners of all ages, Merlin has become their mentor.\n\nBut there was another quest on the horizon—one for the “holy grail,” as the Lab’s former executive director John W. Fitzpatrick puts it. For decades, the Lab had been trying to crack tech’s ability to identify birds by sound. Could Merlin become the “Shazam for birds”?\n\nIn many ways, it’s an unfair comparison: Shazam is an app trained to recognize the one true signature of a pop song in the swirl of a crowded room. Birds are different. They have more than one call. Songs differ slightly each time they’re sung. And even members of the same species can develop distinct dialects region to region. Add to that the sound of wind. Traffic. Your shoes crunching the forest floor. Or what about sound dampeners, like buildings and trees? Not to mention the songs of other birds.\n\nIf we get to the point where one in 20 people in the U.S. is engaged with birds when a local land trust reaches out, they’re going to be more ready to hear those messages.\n\nAs Jessie Barry remembers it, “When the pandemic hit in 2020, we saw [the number of] Merlin users go through the roof. So many people were watching birds, sometimes for the first time. It was a dream come true: The world is paying attention to birds. What can we do with this opportunity?”\n\nWhile attending an audio workshop in New York City with Jessie, Grant Van Horn was inspired by presentations that included spectrograms. “What struck me,” says Grant, “was that we were looking at photos of audio. I thought, Wait, they just take their audio and make a picture? I’m a computer vision researcher, I can absolutely work with that!”\n\nThe timing was right: eBird had just begun accepting audio uploads in 2015. That meant Grant had five years’ worth of recordings to experiment with. “Someone told me Merlin’s photo ID couldn’t distinguish between the Alder and the Willow Flycatchers. I wasn’t really a birder before all this, so I asked my colleagues how you’d tell them apart in real life and they told me they’d listen to the vocalizations.”\n\nSo like the presenters at the audio conference, Grant made pictures. Specifically, he took 30 audio clips apiece for both flycatcher species and rendered spectrograms. Just as he’d trained Merlin’s algorithms to recognize images of birds, Grant now used the same technology to recognize images of their sounds. “The computer was perfect. It’s like, 100% accuracy.”\n\nTo make Sound ID feel miraculous, Merlin needs to bank at least 100 clean recordings of every call for each species. To achieve this, around 350 experts annotate thousands upon thousands of spectrograms made from recordings submitted by people from all over the world. These annotators painstakingly draw and label boxes around individual calls in the spectrograms, helping to train and improve Merlin.\n\nJessie was anxious to get this capability into the hands of people while birds still held their attention, so Sound ID was launched in June 2021. According to Drew Weber, “Each spring, we see a massive uptake. That year we had a double bump in downloads: May for migration and June for Sound ID.”\n\n“When we first started,” says Alex Chang, “we got to number four in the app store’s reference category, and we thought, There’s no way we can beat the Bible, right? Like, how do you beat the Bible? But I guess Sound ID was the answer to that, because we got to number one.”\n\n“Sound ID put Merlin on the map,” says Drew. “It’s in the mainstream conversation now. Sarah Jessica Parker posted about it on Instagram. Sam Darnold, the Seattle Seahawks quarterback, has talked about it at press conferences. Sound ID was a game changer.”\n\nImagine the world as you know it. Now, add 100 million people who care about birds. Add one billion. These numbers may seem improbable, but Merlin’s growth continues to accelerate. This past spring, American usage of Merlin was up 40% over last year. Europe was up 70% over the same period, and there’s double-digit growth in Africa and Asia as well.\n\n“We have a long runway on these projects,” says Jessie Barry. “We’re building out Sound ID in South America, in Africa, really building a global team. We try to look a few years down the road for new opportunities, but right now we’re seeing big returns on the Lab’s mission—connecting people to birds is squarely what Merlin is able to do.”\n\nHow has this marriage of science and tech captivated so many people? “I think you can go all the way back to Arthur Allen and Peter Paul Kellogg,” Jessie continues. “Arthur Allen founded the Lab. Peter Paul Kellogg was an electrical engineer. Together they figured out how to record the first bird sounds in North America in 1929. So in some way, that combination of engineering and ornithology that built Merlin goes back to the Lab’s origin story.”\n\nIn Silent Spring, Rachel Carson’s landmark book about the environmental destruction caused by DDT and other pesticides, she pointed to the “silencing of birds.” What if spring comes and no birds sing? Of course, this formulation only works if people are listening.\n\nWith Merlin, more than 10 million people are tuning into the world around them. “I think we’re just starting to feel the scale of a community,” says Jessie. “If we get to the point where one in 20 people in the U.S. is engaged with birds when, say, a local land trust reaches out, they’re going to be more ready to hear those messages.”\n\nAlready there are signs that the next generation of birders is more conservation-minded. Less focused on personal lists, today’s birders see birds as neighbors. They’re asking questions about what birds need to thrive and what they can do to help. Susan Fox Rogers puts it this way: “If more people are using Merlin, then more people are thinking about birds. You can’t protect something unless you know it. You can’t love something unless you know it.”\n\nTop banner photo credits: Tiktok photos courtesy @theylovefrioo, @nonbinarying, @badgerlandbirding.

    "description": "This was supposed to be the year when autonomous agents took over everyday tasks. The tech industry overpromised and underdelivered.",
    "fullText": "This was no small boast. Chatbots can respond directly to a text-based prompt—by answering a question, say, or writing a rough draft of an e-mail. But an agent, in theory, would be able to navigate the digital world on its own, and complete tasks that require multiple steps and the use of other software, such as web browsers. Consider everything that goes into making a hotel reservation: deciding on the right nights, filtering based on one’s preferences, reading reviews, searching various websites to compare rates and amenities. An agent could conceivably automate all of these activities. The implications of such a technology would be immense. Chatbots are convenient for human employees to use; effective A.I. agents might replace the employees altogether. The C.E.O. of Salesforce, Marc Benioff, who has claimed that half the work at his company is done by A.I., predicted that agents will help unleash a “digital labor revolution,” worth trillions of dollars.\n\nNew Yorker writers reflect on the year’s highs and lows.\n\n2025 was heralded as the Year of the A.I. Agent in part because, by the end of 2024, these tools had become undeniably adept at computer programming. A demo of OpenAI’s Codex agent, from May, showed a user asking the tool to modify his personal website. “Add another tab next to investment/tools that is called ‘food I like.’ In the doc put—tacos,” the user wrote. The chatbot quickly carried out a sequence of interconnected actions: it reviewed the files in the website’s directory, examined the contents of a promising file, then used a search command to find the right location to insert a new line of code. After the agent learned how the site was structured, it used this information to successfully add a new page that featured tacos. As a computer scientist myself, I had to admit that Codex was tackling the task more or less as I would. Silicon Valley grew convinced that other difficult tasks would soon be conquered.\n\nAs 2025 winds down, however, the era of general-purpose A.I. agents has failed to emerge. This fall, Andrej Karpathy, a co-founder of OpenAI, who left the company and started an A.I.-education project, described agents as “cognitively lacking” and said, “It’s just not working.” Gary Marcus, a longtime critic of tech-industry hype, recently wrote on his Substack that “AI Agents have, so far, mostly been a dud.” This gap between prediction and reality matters. Fluent chatbots and reality-bending video generators are impressive, but they cannot, on their own, usher in a world in which machines take over many of our activities. If the major A.I. companies cannot deliver broadly useful agents, then they may be unable to deliver on their promises of an A.I.-powered future.\n\nThis setup turns out to excel at automating software development. Most of the actions required to create or modify a computer program can be implemented by entering a limited set of commands into a text-based terminal. These commands tell a computer to navigate a file system, add or update text in source files, and, if needed, compile human-readable code into machine-readable bits. This is an ideal setting for L.L.M.s. “The terminal interface is text-based, and that is the domain that language models are based on,” Alex Shaw, the co-creator of Terminal-Bench, a popular tool used to evaluate coding agents, told me.\n\nMore generalized assistants, of the sort envisioned by Altman, would require agents to leave the comfortable constraints of the terminal. Since most of us complete computer tasks by pointing and clicking, an A.I. that can “join the workforce” probably needs to know how to use a mouse—a surprisingly difficult goal. The Times recently reported on a string of new startups that have been building “shadow sites”—replicas of popular webpages, like those of United Airlines and Gmail, on which A.I. can analyze how humans use a cursor. In July, OpenAI released ChatGPT Agent, an early version of a bot that can use a web browser to complete tasks, but one review noted that “even simple actions like clicking, selecting elements, and searching can take the agent several seconds—or even minutes.” At one point, the tool got stuck for nearly a quarter of an hour trying to select a price from a real-estate site’s drop-down menu.",

    "description": "A new alloy combines the best of the refractory metals with cutting-edge engineering. The material might just revolutionize modern manufacturing.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nA new alloy combines the best of the refractory metals with cutting-edge engineering.\n\nEven these extremely tough metals can be made to deform and show bands of adjustment.\n\nThese kink bands add strength through subtle shifts in the crystal structure, reducing brittleness.\n\nIn recently published research, scientists have revealed a special alloy that could change the game with its combination of temperature tolerance, resistance to wear, and previously unheard of fracture toughness.\n\nHow do you make one alloy that has it all? The secret is a feature called a kink band, where the material naturally forms a certain way as it is heated and treated. As the saying goes, sometimes our flaws can lead to our greatest strengths. Turns out that’s also true for exotic alloys.\n\nMany metals are soft in their pure form—or, at least, softer than we’d like them to be for applications like manufacturing and heavy machinery. Long ago, humans realized they could combine two metals into one alloy (like bronze) and get results that were tougher, held a sharp edge better, and lasted longer.\n\nWhy are alloys so strong? Well, each element has its own atomic mass and particle size. Think about a pure metal like a game of Jenga. When you push on a block (or deform your metal), you know how that block is going to move. But in an alloy, your Jenga tower is built from blocks of different sizes, meaning it’s much harder to simply “push” (deform) them out of place. There are fewer of the neat lines that are prone to breakage.\n\nIn this paper, researchers from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and a handful of west coast universities collaborated on a new refractory alloy. Refractory—used colloquially to mean stubborn—in this case means an alloy that is extremely tolerant of very high heat. They’re made by combining metals from the fifth and sixth period of the periodic table of elements: molybdenum, niobium, tungsten, tangalum, and rhenium.\n\nThese elements have some of the highest melting points in the known periodic table. They also have very high hardness among the pure metals—although if we’re talking about materials in general, diamond still leaves them in the dust. That means when alloyed in a particular way, these metals (along with a few others with high melting points, like titanium and iridium) can become even more resistant to heat and wear, forming the family of refractory alloys.\n\nThere’s just a few problems. The same toughness and hardness that defines the refractory alloys often means they’re literally too hard to work with, with low ductility and a high likelihood of fracture. In other words, if you’re trying to metalwork a refractory alloy into any kind of shape, it will break instead of bend. We needed to find a middle ground where a very hard refractory alloy could take a hit and deform in the desired way rather than fracturing.\n\nTo do this, the Berkeley Lab scientists “specifically engineered” an alloy of niobium, tantalum, titanium, and hafnium, and formed kink bands in the metal. Inside a solid material like an alloy, kinks and jogs are terms referring to types of flaws that affect the alloy’s structure. Their details are more scientific, but a kink in a power cable or a street that jogs over a bit give you the intuitive idea. While the alloy forms, its crystal structures move around just enough to create these “stretch marks” or seams that show a change in crystal orientation.\n\nIn cables, a kink is often a sign of damage or unusual wear. In the crystals that we use as gemstones, a kink band might ruin the desired sparkly effect by disrupting how light passes through the material. But in the alloy, researchers found that the kink bands resulted from dislocation tolerance—meaning deformability without breaking. The particles in the alloy were able to adapt to a space where the crystals had shifted around, and those bands of adaptation made the results stronger.\n\n“Our work shows that contrary to conventional understanding, complex concentrated refractory alloys can possess exceptional fracture toughness across extreme temperature ranges, even in the cryogenic regime,” the scientists conclude. The next step is more research, since this is just one exploratory paper.\n\nBut in a world waiting on new technologies like quantum computing and nuclear fusion, the cryogenic regime—where materials are cooled to near absolute zero—is vital. The stronger we can make those materials, the better.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

Toyota says that 51,644 versions of the recently refreshed Camry could lose power due to a defective inverter assembly. This issue also involves 3761 copies of the Toyota Corolla Cross.\n\nAccording to a document submitted earlier this month to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the recall affects 2025–2026 Camry models and the 2026 Corolla Cross. The issue stems from the inverter that converts power from the hybrid system's battery to the electric motor, as a bolt inside the assembly could come loose and create an open circuit, which could either cause the vehicle to go into limp mode or lose power. Along with activating a warning light, the loose bolt could lead to a short circuit in certain situations that could cause a fire.\n\nToyota estimates that 34 incidents related to the problem have been reported, along with 15 warranty claims, which caused the company to issue a voluntary recall. While it doesn't currently have a fix for the situation, Toyota says it will inform owners about the necessary steps when those details become available. Meanwhile, the automaker will notify owners about the recall by mail by February 13, 2026.

    "fullText": "CNN’s Harry Enten on Monday broke down how Vice President JD Vance is “running well ahead” of the rest of the potential Republican field ahead of the 2028 GOP presidential primaries.\n\nVance, who has yet to announce a 2028 bid, is the top choice among likely voters in New Hampshire’s Republican primary that year, with 51% planning to vote for him in 2028, according to a University of New Hampshire Granite State poll from October.\n\nThe Republicans trailing Vance among likely GOP voters in the New Hampshire poll are former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley (9%) and National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard (8%).\n\n“There’s a reason why he’s such a heavy favorite in the prediction market so far, because if you win the GOP primary in New Hampshire, chances are, you’re going to be the Republican nominee for president,” said Enten of Vance.\n\nEnten, who likened Vance to racing great Mario Andretti and compared the rest of the field to go-kart drivers, highlighted that Vance is the only non-sitting president for the Republican Party since 1980 to hit 50% or above in early New Hampshire primary polling.\n\nPolitics: Should We Actually Worry About Declining Birth Rates?\n\n“JD Vance is pulling off something historic at this time, and that is the key reason why, at this point, he is the far and away favorite for the Republican nomination,” Enten said.\n\n“He’s just way out ahead of the pack.”\n\nIn an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity last month, Vance said he wants to focus on next year’s midterms before a possible 2028 presidential run.\n\nTrump And Netanyahu Are To Meet In Florida At A Crucial Moment For The US-backed Gaza Ceasefire\n\nTrump Aides Had To Beg Him Not To Leak News About Major Drug Policy Change\n\nTrump Snaps At Reporter Over ‘Dumb Question’ While Greeting Zelenskyy At Mar-A-Lago",

    "description": "Ukraine has used its pioneering naval drones to hit Russian targets like expensive warships. Now it has a growing fleet designed to fight on rivers.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's naval drones are now targeting Russia in waters other than the open ocean.\n\nIt recently unveiled drones designed for use on rivers, including the Barracuda drone.\n\nThe unit that operates the Barracuda said it was able to destroy a Russian base and boat.\n\nThe naval drones that Ukraine has used to hammer Russia's Black Sea Fleet are now targeting Russia in new waterways.\n\nThe 40th Coastal Defense Brigade of Ukraine's 30th Marine Corps said last week that an uncrewed \"Barrauda\" drone was able to penetrate Russian positions, leave mines, and strike Russian targets, damaging a Russian logistical base and a boat equipped with a machine gun.\n\nThe strike comes as Ukraine fields more naval drones designed to hunt Russian targets in smaller bodies of water.\n\nThe brigade shared combat footage that appears to have been filmed by a camera on the drone. The uncrewed vessel can be seen navigating a wide body of water before moving into a much narrower, brown-water channel.\n\nThe newly released video shows a camouflaged boat at a base, and then aerial footage shows a large explosion followed by images of a destroyed building along the water.\n\nThe footage indicates the attack did not take place on the open ocean, as many of Ukraine’s naval drone strikes have, but in a confined inland waterway; Ukrainian outlet Militarnyi reported that the strike occurred on the Dnipro River.\n\nUkraine has used drones across land, air, and sea to gather information on the enemy and strike Russian targets, and its naval drones have helped to weaken Russia's Black Sea Fleet. Ukraine doesn't have a proper navy with powerful ships, but the much cheaper drones have helped damage Russia's expensive warships, even forcing Russia to relocate many vessels further away.\n\nHowever, using drones in river environments or smaller bodies of water is a relatively new development for Ukraine, opening up a new range of targets for newly developed technology.\n\nDedicated drones for those areas, such as the Barracuda or others like the Ursula or Black Widow 2, are newer technology compared to systems like the Sea Baby or Magura drones for open ocean. Ukraine is constantly upgrading its naval drones and creating new ones.\n\nThe Barracuda drone was first showcased by the 40th Separate Coastal Defence Brigade in September.\n\nThe 40th Separate Coastal Defence Brigade showcased the Barracuda in September, saying the drone is designed to \"perform tasks that humans cannot,\" including evacuating people from coastal areas and delivering ammunition to dangerous areas.\n\nIt said a month earlier that the drone is modular, making it easy to swap in different types of weapons, from mines to grenade launchers. It also shared that it uses artificial intelligence, though details on that are limited.\n\nA special unit with the same name designed and launched the Barracuda and is the only one in the Ukrainian military operating the drone right now.\n\nIn recent months, Ukraine has said the Barracuda has destroyed a Russian logistics vessel and its crew and used naval mines to block channels between islands.\n\nDrones are being used \n\nDrones give Ukraine a key advantage because they can be produced domestically and at a fraction of the cost of many traditional weapons, creating an asymmetric threat to expensive assets such as Black Sea Fleet warships or T-90 tanks on the battlefield. Ukraine’s defense minister said last week that the armed forces expect to receive nearly 3 million FPV drones by the end of the year, most of them made at home — though Russia is also rapidly developing and fielding similar technology.\n\nWorried about the potential for a future conflict with Russia, much of the West is closely watching Ukraine's tactics and new war tech. Naval drones are one of the innovations Ukraine has said it is willing to export to partner nations.\n\nNATO allies and defense companies are working on the technology, particularly in the Baltic Sea, which is shared by a host of NATO members and Russia. The US military is also exploring the potential of these weapon systems.\n\nUS Army Gen. Christopher Cavoli, NATO's supreme allied commander in Europe, called the way that Ukraine was able to move Russia's navy with drones an \"arbiter of things in the future.\" He said that \"there seems to be a big role for unmanned maritime systems into the future.\"",

Gavin Newsom.\n\nIn a December 11 letter that was obtained by Business Insider, Spiro lays out his opposition to the proposed tax on behalf of his clients, whom he calls \"California residents who would be subject to the proposed Billionaire Tax Act.\"\n\n\"It will trigger an exodus of capital and innovation from California,\" Spiro wrote. \"Our clients have made clear they will permanently relocate if subjected to this tax.\"\n\nThe measure proposes that California residents with assets exceeding $1 billion be subject to a one-time 5% tax on the value of their assets. If the proposal receives enough signatures, it will appear on the state ballot in November 2026. If passed, it would apply retroactively to all California residents as of January 1, 2026.\n\nWhile Newsom has said he is against the tax and would \"fight\" it, he would not have the ability to veto it if it were to pass as a ballot measure.\n\nSeveral wealthy Californians, including venture capitalist Peter Thiel and Google cofounder Larry Page, have considered shrinking their presence in California, according to a New York Times report. Representatives for Page and Thiel did not respond to Business Insider when asked if they were represented by Spiro.\n\nOver the weekend, billionaire Palmer Luckey took to X to voice his opposition to the measure.\n\n\"I made my money from my first company, paid hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes on it,\" the Anduril cofounder wrote. \"Now me and my cofounders have to somehow come up with billions of dollars in cash.\"\n\nWhile it's not clear which clients the lawyer was referencing in his letter to Newsom, Spiro's client roster in the past has included billionaires and A-listers.

    "description": "Calls are growing for the UK to new rules for younger drivers - but what are they?",
    "fullText": "Ministers are expected to resist calls for a major overhaul of driving qualifications when they unveil their latest plans to improve road safety.\n\nCampaigners have argued that replacing Britain's current driving test regime could prevent thousands of injuries and deaths on the nation’s roads every year.\n\nThe existing ‘one-and-done’ system means newly qualified drivers face the same rules of the road as other more experienced motorists as soon as they pass their test.\n\nHowever, a growing number of experts are calling on Britain to introduce a so-called \"progressive\" or \"graduated\" system, similar to those used in countries such as Australia and the Republic of Ireland, which enforce tighter restrictions on new drivers.\n\nThe AA has estimated such a chance could slash the annual number of people hurt or killed in incidents by as much as two-fifths.\n\nEarlier this month, Simon Foster, police and crime commissioner (PCC) for the West Midlands, became the latest figure to demand the government make changes, calling progressive driving licences “proven, proportionate and urgently needed”.\n\nHowever, transport chiefs are expected to prioritise ‘other measures’ when the government publishes its upcoming Road Safety Strategy.\n\nA Department for Transport spokesperson told Yahoo News in response to Foster's comments: “Whilst we are not considering graduated driving licences, we absolutely recognise that young people are disproportionately victims of tragic incidents on our roads and continue to tackle this through our THINK! Campaign.\n\n“We are considering other measures to address this problem and protect young drivers, as part of our upcoming strategy for road safety – the first in over a decade.”\n\nCurrently, all drivers in England, Wales or Scotland are subject to the same rules whether it has been days or decades since they passed their practical driving test.\n\nNewly qualified motorists can choose to display a green ‘P plate’ if they wish, to indicate their lack of experience to other road users.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, an amber ‘R plate’ must be shown for the first 12 months after qualifying and speed restrictions are enforced.\n\nWhile a ‘graduated’ or ‘progressive’ driving licence could take several forms, it would likely see restrictions such as a top speed, number of passengers and the types of roads they can drive on.\n\nThese would be gradually lifted based on factors such as age, competence behind the wheel and driving experience.\n\nThis has been backed by the AA, which believes it could cut the number of serious accidents involving young drivers.\n\nLast year, the organisation’s president, Edmund King, said: \"The AA believes we need a system of graduated learning with a logbook whereby all learners need to demonstrate their skills on all types of roads and crucially on rural roads where 71% of new driver fatal crashes occur, and in different weather conditions and different times of day or night.”\n\nThe Republic of Ireland requires drivers to complete a two-year probation period, during which they must display ‘N plates’ and comply with lower drink-drive limits than more experienced road users.\n\nIn Australia, new drivers are banned from driving between certain hours at night and have limitations on the number of passengers they can carry.\n\nMotorists in New Zealand go through a three-step process, offering ‘learner’, ‘restricted’ and ‘full’ licences.\n\nThe government has seemingly ruled out any immediate prospect of overhauling driving licence rules in its upcoming Road Safety Strategy, saying instead it would focus on “other measures” to improve highway safety.\n\nThis could include tougher penalties for driving without insurance or failing to wear a seatbelt.\n\nNew research has also suggested a softening in attitudes towards drink-driving among the young.\n\nThe policy is expected to run until 2030, suggesting graduated or progressive licences are unlikely to be considered before then.\n\nThe strategy was expected to be published in the autumn, but it is still not known when the policy is likely to be released.\n\nThe approach has widespread backing.\n\nIn summer 2025, campaign group Protect Young Drivers was launched, a coalition of MPs, emergency services, insurers, academics, charities, campaigners and bereaved families.\n\nOrganisations signed up to the politically neutral, evidence-based approach include the National Police Chiefs' Council, the National Fire Chiefs' Council, the RAC, the AA, Brake, RoadPeace and IAM RoadSmart.\n\nMotoring organisation the AA has previously backed graduated driving licences, with its president, Edmund King, saying: \"We owe it to the next generation to introduce positive measures that will help give them healthy and prosperous lives.”\n\nThe RAC has also said it believes this could “help save lives on the country’s roads”.\n\nIt has also been supported by victims’ charities, such as Brake, which has argued such a scheme could save 4,471 casualties and £224m every year, just based on the impact it could have on drivers aged 17-19.\n\nIn November 2025, the family of Josh Atkins, who died in a car crash when he was 17, spoke about the need for a new system.\n\nCorey Owen Cooper was jailed for five years for causing the death of Atkins by dangerous driving after causing the crash the day after he passed his driving test.\n\nHis family have called for Britain to adopt a graduated driving licence system. “Young and inexperienced drivers need more support, more education, and more accountability before they are given full driving licence privileges,\" they said in a statement after Cooper's conviction.\n\n“This is not about punishment, it is about prevention. If such a system was in place, Josh would still be with us today, still living his life.”\n\nThe policy also appears to have clear public support, with a survey of more than 7,000 people by pollster YouGov showing a clear majority in favour.\n\nHowever, the government has so far refused to consider such a scheme, with Lilian Greenwood, the minister for local transport, telling a House of Commons debate early this year she hoped to improve safety without “unfairly penalising young drivers”.\n\nIn its Roadmap to Tackle Insurance Costs document, the Association of British Insurers (ABI) said the “adoption of graduated driving licences” has the potential to lower premiums.\n\nThe RAC has also suggested it believes a licensing overhaul could see young drivers in particular pay less for their car insurance.\n\nHowever, it also noted this is not certain and that other products – such as ‘black box’ insurance which tracks driving and qualifications such as the Pass Plus scheme – can already help reduce costs.",

    "fullText": "Authorities are still searching for a missing 19-year-old from Bexar County, Texas, who was last seen on Christmas Eve.\n\nRosario Olmos reported that her daughter, Camila Mendoza Olmos, missing since Dec. 24 after Mendoza Olmos left their house that morning. She was last seen on a neighbor’s security camera shortly before 7 a.m. on the 11000 block of Caspian Spring, near San Antonio, CBS affiliate KENS5 reported.\n\nOlmos told the Bexar County Sheriff’s Office that her daughter regularly takes morning walks, and that she became concerned when “Camila did not return within a reasonable period of time,” according to ABC News. Mendoza Olmos did not take her phone with her.\n\n“I called her cellphone, but the cellphone was there on the bed and it was turned off,” Olmos told KENS5. “I put it to charge and went out to look for her. I thought I would find her like other times, walking, and we would come home together.”\n\nThe video footage from that morning shows an individual believed to be Mendoza Olmos searching inside her vehicle for an unidentified item before the footage ends, according to the Bexar County Sheriff’s Office. Investigators believe she left the area on foot, as her car was still at her home.\n\nMendoza Olmos, who is 5’4” and 110 pounds with brown hair and eyes, was last seen wearing a blue-and-black hoodie, baby blue pajama bottoms and white shoes, and is believed to be carrying only her car key and possibly her driver’s license.\n\nBexar County Sheriff Javier Salazar told ABC News that deputies and volunteers have been searching around the clock as they believe that Olmos is in “imminent danger.”\n\nMultiple agencies are assisting with the investigation, including the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, the latter of which is monitoring border crossings and international travel. San Antonio is about 160 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n“We definitely don’t want to miss anything,” Salazar told ABC News. “The ground search is somewhat limited to a couple of square miles. We’re also not ruling out that this case may take us outside the borders of the continental United States.”\n\nMendoza Olmos, a U.S. citizen, was not detained by ICE, Salazar said, adding that authorities are also investigating kidnapping, human trafficking and whether Mendoza Olmos left on her own accord.\n\nMendoza Olmos recently went through a breakup, however Salazar said that the split was mutual and that authorities found no indication of foul play. Those close to Mendoza Olmos are cooperating with the investigation.\n\nThe Sheriff’s office is asking anyone with information regarding Mendoza Olmos’s whereabouts to call the Bexar County Sheriff’s Office at (210) 335-6000 or contact the Bexar County Missing Persons Unit at missingpersons@bexar.org.",

    "title": "After hammering Russian ships on the open ocean, Ukraine's drone boats appear to be taking the fight into new waters",
    "description": "Ukraine has used its pioneering naval drones to hit Russian targets like expensive warships. Now it has a growing fleet designed to fight on rivers.",
    "fullText": "The naval drones that Ukraine has used to hammer Russia's Black Sea Fleet are now targeting Russia in new waterways.\n\nThe 40th Coastal Defense Brigade of Ukraine's 30th Marine Corps said last week that an uncrewed \"Barrauda\" drone was able to penetrate Russian positions, leave mines, and strike Russian targets, damaging a Russian logistical base and a boat equipped with a machine gun.\n\nThe strike comes as Ukraine fields more naval drones designed to hunt Russian targets in smaller bodies of water.\n\nThe brigade shared combat footage that appears to have been filmed by a camera on the drone. The uncrewed vessel can be seen navigating a wide body of water before moving into a much narrower, brown-water channel.\n\nA post shared by 40 окрема бригада берегової оборони (@40obrbo)\n\nThe newly released video shows a camouflaged boat at a base, and then aerial footage shows a large explosion followed by images of a destroyed building along the water.\n\nThe footage indicates the attack did not take place on the open ocean, as many of Ukraine’s naval drone strikes have, but in a confined inland waterway; Ukrainian outlet Militarnyi reported that the strike occurred on the Dnipro River.\n\nUkraine has used drones across land, air, and sea to gather information on the enemy and strike Russian targets, and its naval drones have helped to weaken Russia's Black Sea Fleet. Ukraine doesn't have a proper navy with powerful ships, but the much cheaper drones have helped damage Russia's expensive warships, even forcing Russia to relocate many vessels further away.\n\nHowever, using drones in river environments or smaller bodies of water is a relatively new development for Ukraine, opening up a new range of targets for newly developed technology.\n\nDedicated drones for those areas, such as the Barracuda or others like the Ursula or Black Widow 2, are newer technology compared to systems like the Sea Baby or Magura drones for open ocean. Ukraine is constantly upgrading its naval drones and creating new ones.\n\nThe Barracuda drone was first showcased by the 40th Separate Coastal Defence Brigade in September.\n\nThe 40th Separate Coastal Defence Brigade showcased the Barracuda in September, saying the drone is designed to \"perform tasks that humans cannot,\" including evacuating people from coastal areas and delivering ammunition to dangerous areas.\n\nIt said a month earlier that the drone is modular, making it easy to swap in different types of weapons, from mines to grenade launchers. It also shared that it uses artificial intelligence, though details on that are limited.\n\nA special unit with the same name designed and launched the Barracuda and is the only one in the Ukrainian military operating the drone right now.\n\nIn recent months, Ukraine has said the Barracuda has destroyed a Russian logistics vessel and its crew and used naval mines to block channels between islands.\n\nDrones are being used \n\nDrones give Ukraine a key advantage because they can be produced domestically and at a fraction of the cost of many traditional weapons, creating an asymmetric threat to expensive assets such as Black Sea Fleet warships or T-90 tanks on the battlefield. Ukraine’s defense minister said last week that the armed forces expect to receive nearly 3 million FPV drones by the end of the year, most of them made at home — though Russia is also rapidly developing and fielding similar technology.\n\nWorried about the potential for a future conflict with Russia, much of the West is closely watching Ukraine's tactics and new war tech. Naval drones are one of the innovations Ukraine has said it is willing to export to partner nations.\n\nNATO allies and defense companies are working on the technology, particularly in the Baltic Sea, which is shared by a host of NATO members and Russia. The US military is also exploring the potential of these weapon systems.\n\nUS Army Gen. Christopher Cavoli, NATO's supreme allied commander in Europe, called the way that Ukraine was able to move Russia's navy with drones an \"arbiter of things in the future.\" He said that \"there seems to be a big role for unmanned maritime systems into the future.\"",

    "title": "I quit Google and ended my path to a US green card to cofound a startup in London. It's a huge risk, but I want to live an exciting life.",
    "description": "Gregor Konzett quit his dream job at Google and gave up his US visa to be part of a startup accelerator program. Here's how he took a calculated risk.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Gregor Konzett, a 27-year-old former Google employee based in London. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I got relocated to work out of Google's Mountain View headquarters in 2024, it was a dream come true.\n\nI was raised in a small village in Austria, but I always dreamed of living in Silicon Valley. As a child who was excited about tech, I wanted to be where innovation happened.\n\nMy team was based in California, but I was working from London. Not even a year into my job, I was asking if I could be transferred.\n\nTwo years after getting hired as a software engineer, Google transferred me to Silicon Valley. Then, a year after that, I quit. I packed up my bags and moved back to London in just two weeks to participate in a startup accelerator program. It was worth the risk, even in this difficult job market.\n\nI joined Google in 2022 as a software engineer on the Google Pixel audio team. I enjoyed my job, but being in London, the physical distance turned minor questions into major delays. If I hit a blocker with a specific subsystem, I'd send a message and wait 24 hours for a reply due to time zone differences, or spend many late nights in chats with colleagues to unblock myself.\n\nAfter I was finally relocated to the Mountain View headquarters, living in the Bay Area was almost exactly as I had always imagined it from movies and TV. California is the most beautiful place I've ever been to, and being able to call it my home was incredible.\n\nIt was great to be part of an environment filled with so many other engineers. I remember going surfing with some people and just having the most Silicon Valley conversation ever about coding and deep tech. The only thing I didn't expect was that it's not this crazy, futuristic place. In reality, the infrastructure was just OK, and the internet speed wasn't even very reliable.\n\nThe work life at the Google headquarters was really nice. On average, it was a typical 9-to-5, and my team had a really great dynamic.\n\nFor the first few months, I was learning a lot, and everything ramped up quickly. My team gave me a lot of responsibility and trusted me to handle huge pieces of the system, which is amazing and rare for a company of its size.\n\nBeing in the office, I got to sit on the same floor as the teams building the specific subsystems I was coding for, and sit in meetings where product decisions were actually made. I could walk 10 feet, point at a whiteboard, and solve complex architectural issues in minutes. I learned \n\nHowever, after about a year, I felt like I had reached a natural ceiling in my work, and I wasn't learning much anymore. I wasn't super happy in my job, and my visa limited me from working on my own projects outside of Google, which was my real dream.\n\nOne of my closest friends got into a startup accelerator program in London and encouraged me to apply, with the plan of using it as an opportunity to cofound our own startup. When I got accepted with a start date only a month away, I knew I'd have to make a quick decision. I loved California, and leaving Google would mean leaving the country.\n\nThe job market has been terrible, and I questioned whether this was the right time to quit my job and potentially face unemployment. However, I felt confident in my technical background and having Google on my résumé, so I believed I could find another job.\n\nThe hardest part about deciding to quit was that it was objectively a really good job, and leaving meant giving up my path to a green card in the US. I was stuck in a dilemma: do I stay in a role I've outgrown for four, or potentially even more years, just to secure permanent residency, or do I quit to chase higher job satisfaction?\n\nI realized that staying for the sake of immigration meant stalling my career development.\n\nI figured now was the time to take a risk. I'm young and have a financial runway from my Google salary, and I don't have a mortgage to pay or a family to care for. So, I put in my two weeks at Google.\n\nIt's been a few months since I joined the program, and my friend and I are working on our startup, Vestry.ai, which fixes the observability gap for complex hardware. Our plan is to build while we're in the accelerator, get funding, and move back to California to live the startup life.\n\nCalifornia is ultimately the place to be for anything in the startup world. We want to be a part of the AI revolution, and that's just where you've got to be.\n\nI've been so busy with the program I haven't really had any time to think about whether I made the right choice, but I'm convinced I'm where I need to be.\n\nDo you have a story to share about quitting Big Tech? If so, please reach out to the reporter at tmartinelli@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "China says the drills are a stern warning to pro-independence forces, but they look a lot like a practice run.",
    "fullText": "Beijing is calling its massive war games around Taiwan this week a stern warning; however, they are also practice, offering insight into how China is thinking about a war for the island.\n\nThe big military exercise, \"Justice Mission-2025,\" that kicked off Monday is the latest large-scale Chinese drill aimed at preparing the People's Liberation Army for action such as bringing combined arms to bear against Taiwan, seizing control of the skies, isolating and assaulting the island, and combating foreign interference.\n\nChina mobilized its army, navy, air, and rocket forces for drills around Taiwan with a focus on combat readiness in the sea and air, blocking off key ports and areas, and what it said was \"all-dimensional deterrence outside the island chain.\"\n\nOn the southeast side of the island, China's military has been using bombers and anti-ship missiles against mock maritime targets, clearing the way for the navy's amphibious assault ships. The exercises, China's Eastern Theater Command said, are testing how well air and naval forces operate together. There was also an emphasis on eliminating targets at \"maximum range,\" key to cutting risk and keeping hostile forces at arm's length.\n\nTo the north and southwest of Taiwan, the Chinese military's destroyers, frigates, fighters, bombers, and drones, together with the long-range rocket forces, have been practicing coordinated seizure and dominance, pursuing training targets on land, at sea, and in the air, the way it might in a real fight.\n\nIn recent years, China has put greater emphasis on more realistic training.\n\nIn the air, Chinese fighters, airborne early warning aircraft, and electronic warfare planes have been training to effectively secure air superiority, while action at sea has been focused on defeating both surface ships and submarines.\n\n\"With vessels and aircraft approaching Taiwan island in close proximity from different directions,\" a command spokesperson said, \"troops of multiple services engage in joint assaults to test their joint operations capabilities.\"\n\nVideo shared by the Eastern Theater Command showed preparations for the drills, including trucks carrying missiles, fighter jets and other aircraft, and warship activity.\n\n🇨🇳 🇹🇼 🪖China holds large-scale combat exercises east of Taiwan\n\nThe drills held by the People's Liberation Army’s Eastern Theater Command were aimed at testing joint sea–air coordination, precise target detection, and rapid neutralization capabilities. pic.twitter.com/2veIz926ZJ\n\nThe training isn't entirely simulated and includes live-fire activities against mock targets. The live-fire exercises will take place in five maritime and airspace zones around Taiwan.\n\nChina's coast guard is also on patrol in the waters surrounding Taiwan. The island's defense ministry said on Monday afternoon that it had detected 14 Chinese navy warships and 14 coast guard vessels around Taiwan and outlying islands. Additionally, 89 aircraft, including J-10 and J-16 fighters, JH-7 fighter-bombers, and KJ-500 early warning and control planes, had been detected around Taiwan as well. None of the ships or planes violated Taiwan's territorial airspace or waters.\n\nTaiwan's defense ministry said that the island has been conducting its own rapid response drills amid the Chinese exercise.\n\nThe drills show how China's military plans to use its current forces in a coordinated attack, but in official releases, there were also indications about its future ambitions. On Monday, China released an artificial intelligence-made short video on a Taiwan fight.\n\nThe video showed various animals, like eagles and bees, transforming into uncrewed aerial vehicles, sea creatures becoming warships, and wolves turning into uncrewed ground robots. The AI-generated video, titled \"Joint Operations to Thwart 'Taiwan Independence' Attempts,\" also featured a pack of humanoid drones carrying rifles and walking through a war-torn city.\n\n🇨🇳 PLA Eastern Theater Command releases AI propaganda video 《联武群戈斩“独”道》(Joint Operations to Thwart ‘Taiwan Independence’ Attempts) https://t.co/gKUa2CanWJ pic.twitter.com/l0fUHtVVVp\n\nThe propaganda video, despite its artistic styling and the featuring of some technology not currently known to exist, suggests China is aiming for an integrated approach using a range of uncrewed systems and advanced capabilities, like submarines and warships and aircraft.\n\nCombining assets has been an important part of the latest military drills. Effectively integrating wide-ranging combat capabilities for combined arms warfare is a challenging feat though.",

    "description": "Beyoncé is officially a billionaire, according to Forbes. She joins wealthy musicians like Taylor Swift and Rihanna in the elite club.",
    "fullText": "Less than 10 years after Beyoncé famously sang, \"I just might be a Black Bill Gates in the making,\" she's been named a billionaire.\n\nBeyoncé's already-formidable net worth surged after a pair of successful tours: the 2023 Renaissance World Tour, which grossed nearly $600 million, and the 2025 Cowboy Carter Tour, which Forbes described as \"the most successful concert tour\" in the history of country music.\n\nIn addition to live performances and lucrative merchandise sales, Beyoncé has spent decades building her business empire. She founded Parkwood Entertainment in 2010, followed by a clothing line, Ivy Park, a hair-care brand, Cécred, and a whiskey label, SirDavis.\n\nNevertheless, as Forbes reports, the bulk of Beyoncé's fortune remains rooted in her music. Beyoncé controls the rights to her valuable album catalog, from 2003's \"Dangerously In Love\" to 2025's \"Cowboy Carter\" and beyond. All production costs for her music, documentaries, and concerts are handled in-house through Parkwood.\n\n\"When I decided to manage myself, it was important that I didn't go to some big management company,\" Beyoncé said while promoting her 2013 self-titled album. \"I felt like I wanted to follow the footsteps of Madonna and be a powerhouse and have my own empire and show other women when you get to this point in your career, you don't have to go sign with someone else and share your money and your success — you do it yourself.\"\n\nJay-Z has been pursuing mogul status for over three decades.\n\nThe East Coast rapper founded Roc-A-Fella Records in 1995. Since then, Jay-Z has started his own sports agency, Roc Nation Sports. He bought and sold the music streaming platform Tidal, netting himself $149 million, according to a 2021 Forbes report. He owns stakes in the Champagne brand Armand de Brignac and the Cognac brand D'Ussé. His umbrella company, Roc Nation, has inked a multimillion-dollar partnership with the NFL. The list goes on.\n\nAll that, in addition to his extremely popular discography, has contributed to his vast wealth. As of December 2025, Forbes estimates Jay-Z's net worth to be $2.5 billion, making him the richest musician on this list.\n\nBloomberg reported that Taylor Swift became a billionaire in October 2023. Forbes corroborated this report in April 2024, about halfway through her record-smashing Eras Tour. By the end of its two-year run, the Eras Tour became the first in history to gross $2 billion.\n\nSwift redistributed a significant portion of her touring profits to her crew, reportedly handing out $197 million in bonuses alone. She continued to donate millions to charitable organizations through 2025, including Feeding America, the American Heart Association, MusiCares, ACM Lifting Lives, and the CMA Foundation.\n\nUnlike many of her peers, Swift's wealth comes solely from her — she doesn't have any lucrative side hustles. Swift's sizable net worth estimates are largely based on the value of her musical catalog, which she owns outright. Swift's 12th studio album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" sold over 4 million copies in its debut week, smashing the single-week album sales record and finishing the year as the top-performing album on the Billboard 200 chart.\n\nAs of December 2025, Forbes estimated Swift's net worth to be $1.6 billion.\n\nIn September 2024, Bloomberg estimated Selena Gomez's net worth to be $1.3 billion, largely thanks to her makeup brand, Rare Beauty.\n\nHowever, Forbes has estimated Gomez's net worth to be roughly $700 million, citing reported cash flow issues with Wondermind, the startup Gomez cofounded in 2021 with her mother, Mandy Teefey, and entrepreneur Daniella Pierson.\n\nStill, Forbes reports, \"Gomez's biggest asset is her estimated 51% stake in Rare Beauty.\" The vegan and cruelty-free brand is widely recognized as one of Sephora's biggest money-makers and most popular celebrity beauty lines; the cult-favorite blush alone generated $70 million in 2022.\n\nIn addition to her success as a businesswoman, Gomez is a celebrated actor. She has been nominated for several Golden Globes for the hit Hulu comedy series, \"Only Murders in the Building.\" She was also nominated for a Golden Globe for her supporting role in the 2024 film \"Emilia Pérez.\"\n\nGomez executive produces many of her own projects, including \"Only Murders,\" HBO's \"Selena + Chef,\" and Disney Channel's \"Wizards Beyond Waverly Place,\" a sequel to the show that made Gomez famous as a teenager.\n\nGomez began releasing albums while starring on \"Wizards of Waverly Place\" via Disney's Hollywood Records. Since signing a new contract with Interscope in 2014, Gomez has released two solo albums and a handful of top-10 hits. Her latest album, \"I Said I Love You First,\" is a collaboration with her fiancé, Benny Blanco.\n\nOver 50 years after The Boss released his first album, \"Greetings from Asbury Park,\" the New Jersey legend was named a billionaire by Forbes. As of December 2025, Forbes estimates Bruce Springsteen's net worth to be $1.2 billion.\n\nAs Variety reported, much of Springsteen's wealth comes from the 2021 sale of his music catalog to Sony for $500 million.\n\nIn addition to that mega-sale, Springsteen is constantly on the road, earning money from his packed touring schedule with the E Street Band.\n\nForbes estimates Rihanna's net worth to be $1 billion.\n\nDespite Rihanna's decadelong reign as a hitmaker, she hasn't released an album since 2016's \"Anti,\" which means that most of her wealth is from her two eponymously named brands: Fenty Beauty, which she co-owns with the French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH, and Savage X Fenty, a lingerie brand.\n\nAfter its initial launch in 2017, Fenty Beauty has since expanded to encompass Fenty Skin, Fenty Hair, and Fenty Fragrance. Rihanna was also named Puma's creative director in 2014.",

    "fullText": "The first night of my first cruise was terrifying. The floor trembled beneath me. I was startled by booming noises coming from the decks above and below mine. Was that furniture falling, sliding, and crashing into walls?\n\nI sat stiffly on the couch at midnight, determined to stay awake and prepared for disaster. I read the emergency instructions over and over for what felt like hours until I accidentally fell asleep.\n\nWhen I woke up, I rushed out the door to ensure everything was all right. As seemingly unfazed cruisers filled the buffet and lined up for the water slides, I realized I'd experienced a normal night at sea.\n\nThis was back in April 2022, when I booked a room on one of the largest cruise ships in the world, Royal Caribbean's 18-deck Wonder of the Seas.\n\nFor $2,000, I spent seven nights in a 179-square-foot ocean-view stateroom at the very front of deck eight. It was a mid-tier room — a step above the windowless interior staterooms, a step below staterooms with a balcony, and two steps below a suite.\n\nAfter my first rocky night aboard the ship, I wondered whether everyone had the same experience. So, I talked to some fellow passengers who were seasoned cruisers. They told me that the front of the ship is one of the worst places to be if you're prone to seasickness. They said that higher decks in the middle of the ship feel calmer and more stable.\n\nSince my room on the 18-deck ship was situated at the front of the eighth floor, I felt constant motion in my room. As someone who gets motion sickness from the slightest movement of bathwater, this spoiled many aspects of my first cruise.\n\nSome nights were rockier than others. On the roughest nights, I heard and felt a similar sensation to thunder beneath me every few minutes. Loud thumps and heavy vibrations in my room sounded like large pieces of furniture colliding.\n\nDuring the days at sea, it was especially challenging for me to eat and participate in activities. And I didn't feel rested for my excursions at port stops, which included hikes in the sun.\n\nCruise passengers prone to motion sickness should book a room in the middle of the ship to feel the least amount of rocking.\n\nI wish I'd researched how the location of a cabin can affect the amount of motion you feel while the ship is moving before booking my cruise. Next time, I'd choose a room in the middle of the ship.",

    "description": "Family scapegoats, often blamed for larger family issues, can struggle with boundaries and trust",
    "fullText": "On the surface, a family scapegoat often looks as if they're the problem child.\n\nThey might be the college dropout in a legacy of Ivy Leaguers or the introverted gamer in a family of outgoing athletes. Sometimes, they're just the foil to their golden-child sibling; more aloof or less financially successful.\n\nThese are the black sheep that some parents seek therapy to \"fix.\" However, the issue usually lies in the family dynamic itself, not the individual child, Annie Wright, a licensed marriage and family therapist in California, told Business Insider.\n\n\"There's a family systems issue, but they're pointing to one person as the scapegoat,\" Wright said. Behind the scenes, one spouse could be having an affair, the parents could be having explosive fights, and the marriage could be breaking down. By being assigned blame for the entire family's dysfunction, family scapegoats become \"the person who holds the unconscious collective burden of the family.\"\n\nWright shared some signs you might be the scapegoat of your family, even if you do your best to fit in.\n\nScapegoats don't always feel like they're underachieving in the family. Some might feel the opposite: in a family that enforces more rigid gender roles, Wright said, you might be the black sheep if you're the first woman to go to college or work as a CEO.\n\nThe point is that scapegoats don't fit in. They're usually \"the person who acts antithetical to the norms of the family,\" she said. Simply doing things differently can get you branded as a family outsider.\n\nNot everyone responds the same way to being the family scapegoat. Some might even cycle through different stages, Wright said.\n\n\"At the far end of the spectrum, they really embrace that identity,\" she said, noting that some people lean into the black sheep label and continually try to rebel against their family.\n\nOn the other end, \"people can fight tooth and nail to fit in after the very painful experience of being rejected by a family system,\" she said.\n\nAnd between those two extremes, many people teeter between both, going through periods of withdrawal or fawning for approval.\n\nFamily dynamics can shape all other relationships, from romantic partnerships to friendships, Wright said.\n\nFamily scapegoats may experience social challenges such as \"feeling like they can trust others, feeling like it's safe to be themselves, feeling like they can assert themselves and have that be OK,\" Wright said.\n\nThey might hold back in relationships, fearing yet another rejection.\n\nIt's common to be drawn to what feels familiar, so family scapegoats might unconsciously seek out relationships where they still feel like the ones taking all the blame.\n\n\"If at some level you had a family system that othered you, you might be drawn to partners or friends who are critical of the way you are,\" Wright said. This is doubly so if their parents were vocally and frequently critical of them.\n\nAs painful as it can be to find yourself a family scapegoat, Wright said it's the beginning of a new path. You can alter the dynamics in your relationships, including those within your family, once you start to realize that you deserve better.",

    "fullText": "\"It's one of those products that's truly an experience,\" said Blessed Little Bungalow's Amber Guyton. People love how oversized and comfortable it is.\n\nIt helps that they may have seen it and sat on it in person. Diners at RH's rooftop restaurant have to first make their way through the showroom. \"The Cloud Sofa's everywhere,\" said Guyton.\n\nAnd it is as comfortable as it looks. \"It is like sitting on a cloud,\" said Studio London Co.'s Travis London. \"I mean, the sofa is basically one huge pillow.\"\n\nLondon said mimicking the pillows is the most important future. \"It has huge pillow backs\" with down filling, he said, so if you want that softness, that's what you should look for.\n\nIf you don't want to get a whole new couch, you could look into new pillows for your existing one instead. \"By doing that, you are adding more of the bounce factor and the comfortability,\" said London. \"So that is a great way to do it on a budget.\"\n\nMore generally, though, London said he likes his own RH sofa because it's lasted a long time, and he's updated it with new fabric as his tastes change. \"If you have good bones in a sofa, you can constantly reupholster the sofa throughout its lifetime,\" he said.\n\nThe deeper seat and 18.5-inch height of the Cloud Sofa's cushions might not be for everyone, said Guyton.\n\n\"The female clients I have, they don't wanna feel like a little kid with their feet dangling off the sofa,\" she said. People with mobility or joint issues may want something higher and less deep as well.\n\nThen there's the white or linen color you often see on the Cloud couch. \"You definitely have to be mindful of that with shedding pets and kids and markers and all of that,\" said Guyton. If you're looking for an everyday sofa, you might want to go with a darker color. Otherwise, you may end up with a comfy couch you don't actually feel comfortable sitting in, she said.\n\nBoth London and Guyton say looking at consumer reviews is crucial, especially if they include images of the couch in their home.\n\nThe first thing to pay attention to is how people describe the comfort, said Guyton. \"If I can't take a comfortable nap on my sofa, then I'm not going to invest in it,\" she said. You'll also want to pay attention to measurements, including width, seat depth, and seat height.\n\nSome retailers also provide information on how much wear and tear a sofa can withstand. \"Look at the Wyzenbeek test on a fabric's durability,\" said Paige Gray of Paige Gray Studios. \"The higher the better, but for upholstery, I wouldn't dip below 30,000 for lightly used pieces and 50,000 for more heavily utilized sofas.\"\n\nThen, London said, look for a retailer with a really good return policy. That way, if you don't like it or it doesn't fit, you can send it back with minimal hassle.\n\nMost companies are able to offer an estimated delivery window of when your couch will arrive.  Some of the couches on this list can ship and be delivered as soon as two or three weeks, while custom or made-to-order options can take upward of three to four months.\n\nGuyton said it's worth the wait to get what you want. \"You don't wanna settle for something just to fill the space,\" she said. \"You wanna know that it's going to stand the test of time.\"",

    "fullText": "A proposed billionaire tax in California has the wealthy threatening to flee, according to a letter written by power lawyer Alex Spiro to Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nIn a December 11 letter that was obtained by Business Insider, Spiro lays out his opposition to the proposed tax on behalf of his clients, whom he calls \"California residents who would be subject to the proposed Billionaire Tax Act.\"\n\n\"It will trigger an exodus of capital and innovation from California,\" Spiro wrote. \"Our clients have made clear they will permanently relocate if subjected to this tax.\"\n\nThe measure proposes that California residents with assets exceeding $1 billion be subject to a one-time 5% tax on the value of their assets. If the proposal receives enough signatures, it will appear on the state ballot in November 2026. If passed, it would apply retroactively to all California residents as of January 1, 2026.\n\nWhile Newsom has said he is against the tax and would \"fight\" it, he would not have the ability to veto it if it were to pass as a ballot measure.\n\nSeveral wealthy Californians, including venture capitalist Peter Thiel and Google cofounder Larry Page, have considered shrinking their presence in California, according to a New York Times report. Representatives for Page and Thiel did not respond to Business Insider when asked if they were represented by Spiro.\n\nOver the weekend, billionaire Palmer Luckey took to X to voice his opposition to the measure.\n\n\"I made my money from my first company, paid hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes on it,\" the Anduril cofounder wrote. \"Now me and my cofounders have to somehow come up with billions of dollars in cash.\"\n\nWhile it's not clear which clients the lawyer was referencing in his letter to Newsom, Spiro's client roster in the past has included billionaires and A-listers.

    "description": "Michelin-star chef Camari Mick shared signs that a bakery may not be good, like filled cannoli sitting out and croissants with uneven layers.",
    "fullText": "Food can get expensive, which means it's as important as ever to seek out good value with every purchase — even the croissant you have with your morning coffee.\n\nJust ask Camari Mick, the executive pastry chef at The Musket Room, who's also a partner at Raf's.\n\nMick knows her way around a bakery. She grew up visiting local shops and then studied the art of pastry in fine-dining restaurants across New York City. At Raf's, Mick turns out breads, croissants, and more for the restaurant's daytime bakery while leading the rest of the pastry program.\n\nDubbed NYC's dessert doyenne, the chef has developed her own set of red flags to look out for whenever she visits high-end bakeries.\n\nHere's how you can tell if you're at a spot that's serving high-quality products.\n\nThe first thing Mick does when she walks into a high-end bakery is study the classics. If she sees croissants, she'll look at the plain variety, taking note of the folds that make up the pastry's lamination.\n\nSome great bakeries will have croissants with layers that look perfectly aligned, others might take on a more rustic feel and seem more obviously hand-rolled. Both are welcome characteristics, Mick says.\n\nBut it's a bad sign if the lamination is \"very thick, or small, or not uniform,\" she told Business Insider. And if the croissants look perfectly machine-made, something may not be right in the kitchen.\n\nMick also looks at the color of the croissants, which can clue you into how they may taste. If it's too blonde on the outside, it may not have much flavor inside.\n\nSimilarly, she says, a pastry probably won't be super flaky if it looks as if it was \"sweating on itself\" after being covered while hot, and you can see its layers are wrinkly.\n\nOverall, Mick says, if it doesn't look as if love has been put into the pastries, she \"probably will only just grab a coffee.\"\n\nMick says high-end bakeries should only be selling fresh bread.\n\nIdeally, you should touch the bread to see whether it's too hard. If that's not an option, there are telltale signs a loaf could be subpar.\n\n\"If you were looking at any bread and it looks super voluptuous and almost fresh out of the oven, you're good to go,\" she told BI. \"But if you see that the bread is already wrapped, whether it be in plastic or paper, it's probably an indicator that it was wrapped warm and is not going to be good.\"\n\nMick says fresh bread needs room to breathe, and wrapping it even while it's only slightly warm will cause it to steam itself, potentially making it soggy.\n\nBefore she even steps into a bakery, Mick may turn to Instagram for visuals.\n\nFirst, she'll comb through the location tag for any given bakery, keeping an eye out for whatever item she was hoping to order.\n\nShe tries to see whether the baked good looks the same in all of the photos shared by diners. If it looks different every few pictures, she's probably not going to order it because it's unlikely to be very good, or the quality may vary depending on the batch.\n\nAnd when you're going to be spending a chunk of change at a pricier bakery, you don't want quality to be left up to chance.\n\nThe pastry chef says her understanding of chemistry also makes her hesitant to buy certain pastries that aren't made to order.\n\n\"You know that a crispy something filled with a moist, wet filling is going to be soggy after sitting for, like, 10 minutes,\" Mick said.\n\nFor example, a bakery that fills cannoli shells and leaves them in the case until they're purchased raises some concerns.\n\nLook out for flies around the pastry case, Mick warns.\n\n\"If you see any type of fly problem or any kind of insect infestation in the case, be sure it's everywhere,\" she told BI.\n\nYou may even want to peek into the bakery's bathroom before placing an order.\n\nShe added: \"I'm a big believer on if their bathroom is messy, their kitchen is messy.\"\n\nThis story was originally published on April 3, 2024, and most recently updated on December 29, 2025.",

    "title": "What Is Zone 2 Cardio, and How Do I Actually Do It?",
    "description": "If you have the time for it, \"LISS cardio\" is a cheat code for fitness gains.",
    "fullText": "A healthy dose of cardio is an important part of your exercise routine, and for a lot of us, \"zone 2\" cardio is going to make up a big chunk of that. Low-intensity cardio—sometimes called LISS or “zone 2”—used to be an underrated form of exercise. It's super trendy now, after spending years on the sidelines while HIIT and lifting-only routines ran the field. But what is zone 2 cardio, exactly? How can you make sure you're doing it right? And is it really so bad if your heart rate drifts into zone 3?\n\nZone 2 training is cardio done at a steady, low intensity. It has benefits for aerobic training (so you can run faster), anaerobic training (helping you to recover faster between reps and sets, or between intervals), and it's also an efficient, low-fatigue way to burn calories.\n\n“Zone 2” is a term drawn from the five-zone system of heart rate training, and the same concept is also known by other names and metrics. To runners, it is “easy pace” or “long slow distance pace.” To cyclists, it corresponds to zones 2 and 3 of a seven-zone system of mechanical power. In other sports, like swimming and rowing, it’s often just called “easy” or “low-intensity” exercise.\n\nAll that said, there is no official definition of zone 2, and different devices won't necessarily agree with each other. The same heart rate might be \"zone 2\" on one device and \"zone 3\" on another. So please take the following with a grain of salt.\n\nThe hallmark of zone 2 training is that it’s relatively slow and that it’s done at a steady pace. You'll be aiming for a heart rate of around 70%, but that doesn’t mean doing intervals at 90% and then resting at 50%. It means holding that 70% level the whole time you’re exercising. You can do zone 2 cardio with any steady, repetitive movement. Popular methods are running, cycling, swimming, rowing, brisk walking, fast hiking, or churning away on the elliptical. (Walking can count if you're new to exercise; as you get fitter, you'll probably need to choose a slightly harder form of exercise.)\n\nTo be clear, it’s still work—it’s not the same as sitting around resting—but it should feel like you could keep going forever if you wanted to. You don’t stop a zone 2 session when you get tired, you stop it because you set out for a 30- or 45- or 60-minute session, and your time is up.\n\nZone 2 work builds your aerobic base. When you do cardio at this kind of easy pace, your body adapts to get more efficient at it. These adaptations are great for your health as well as your cardio fitness. You grow more capillaries (tiny blood vessels) to get oxygen and nutrients to your muscles more efficiently. You get more mitochondria in each muscle cell (you have thousands of mitochondria powering each cell) and you produce more of the enzymes that turn fuel from food into usable energy. Your heart and your lungs get more efficient at taking in oxygen and moving blood to your muscles, and your muscles become able to store more carbohydrates (in a form called glycogen) so that more of the carbs you eat are at the ready when you start a run or ride.\n\nFor runners, your zone 2 work, often called \"easy pace,\" should make up most (some say 80%) of your weekly mileage. The fitness you build doing easy running is what allows you to benefit from, and recover from, harder efforts like interval training.\n\nFor people whose main sport is more strength oriented (meatheads like myself), zone 2 cardio strengthens the same body systems that help us recover between sets, and even between reps. It increases our work capacity, letting us get more work done in total. As long as you’re eating enough, adding cardio into your routine should make you able to do more work in the gym, not less. (And no, cardio does not kill your gains.)\n\nAnd for people who are just exercising for health, zone 2 cardio is the perfect “moderate” exercise we’re all supposed to get at least 150 minutes of per week. It’s heart-healthy, and even people with medical conditions that limit their ability to exercise can often do low intensity cardio safely. (Ask your doctor to be sure, of course.)\n\nImportantly, zone 2 training is very low fatigue. More time-efficient forms of cardio and conditioning like HIIT, hill sprints, or CrossFit WODs are great for your aerobic fitness, but those workouts have to be high intensity to work, and you’ll be pooped afterward. They’re great in small doses, but they kind of have to be in small doses.\n\nTechnically, zone 2 is defined in terms of heart rate, and the idea is that you glance at your watch and see whether you're in zone 2 or not. (There are five zones, with zone 5 being the hardest, so zone 2 is the second-easiest). But even though “zone 2” is defined in terms of heart rate, there are so many caveats to determining your max and deciding on the zone boundaries that I don’t recommend that beginners calculate it from heart rate percentages at first. Unless you’ve actually gotten your heart rate up to a maximum effort level, and know what that number is, you don’t really know your max heart rate.\n\nSo if you're a beginner, the best way to know if you’re in zone 2 is to ignore your watch and instead pay attention to your effort, and how it feels. On a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is nothing and 10 is all-out sprinting, low intensity cardio is about a 3 to 5. You’re working, but not very hard. If your breath starts to get ragged, or if you feel like you're getting pretty damn tired and you can't wait for this to end, you're probably somewhere 7+ and definitely going too hard for a zone 2 workout.\n\nA zone 2 pace is conversational, and it’s sometimes described with a “talk test.” If you could tell your friend about your day while you’re exercising, you’re probably around the right level. That doesn’t mean spitting out a few words here and there, but speaking in full sentences without feeling out of breath. If you find yourself stopping to catch your breath or if you feel like you need to take break, you’re going too hard. (That said, some of zone 3 is also within that conversational zone, but it's okay—zone 3 is still good for you.)\n\nThat said, it shouldn’t feel too easy—zone 2 is more like a brisk walk or easy jog than a leisurely stroll. If you stop, you should feel like you took a break from something. It should take a little work and focus to keep up the pace.\n\nBefore you start, there's a big caveat. Zone 2 is based on heart rate zones, and to set your zones correctly, you need an accurate max heart rate. Finding your max is a trickier task than you might expect, so you have my permission to skip this section completely, and scroll down to \"How do you know when you're in zone 2?\" which will teach you how to get into zone 2 by feel, no heart rate monitor needed.\n\nWith that out of the way, I'll explain how exactly to find your zone 2, if you want to do it by the book. There are two steps: finding your max heart rate, and then setting your zones based on that heart rate.\n\nYour maximum heart rate is defined as, literally, the fastest your heart can beat. (Sometimes people assume this is a guideline, that you should keep your heart rate under this number. Nope—if your heart rate is higher than the number you thought was your max, that just tells you that number was not your max.) Here are some different ways to find your max heart rate:\n\nA max heart rate field test (best for people with healthy hearts and some pain tolerance): There are a few ways of doing this, but basically you're going to try to push your heart rate to its absolute max, and see what that number is. The most common way is to find a long, steep hill, and run up it three times, really sprinting hard on the last one. The number you see at the end is a good estimate of your max. Obviously, don't do this if you've been told you shouldn't exercise at high intensity.\n\nYour personal history (best for athletes who have experience using a HR monitor): If you've done high intensity exercise in the past, especially killer efforts that left you collapsed on the floor, the highest number you've ever seen on your watch or heart rate monitor is probably your max, or close to it. A 5K race or an FTP test will often get you close, if you really pushed yourself the whole way.\n\nEstimating based on easy exercise (best for non-athletes who have experience using a HR monitor): If you have a sense of what heart rate you see when you're exercising at a steady, conversational pace, multiply the highest number you would consider conversational by 1.25 to find a number that you can use as your max. This is my own method, but it's based on studies that have found the top of conversational pace to be around 77-79% of max. This isn't as good as a field test, but for many people it will give a better result than the formula below.\n\nA formula. I don't recommend using a formula if you have the option of using either of the first two real-world options above. Using a formula to get your max heart rate is like asking ChatGPT for your shoe size. It will give a plausible guess, but it could easily be very, very wrong. Anyway, the easiest formula is to subtract your age from 220. (There are other formulas, but honestly they all have serious inaccuracies. I wouldn't worry about whether any one of them is \"better\" than the others. They all suck.)\n\nI have more here on why max heart rate formulas are pretty much all wrong, but that's beside the point for the moment. If you know your max heart rate, you can proceed to the next step.\n\nOnce you know your max heart rate (or have an estimate you're willing to work with), multiply to get the upper and lower boundaries of zone 2. Multiply by what? Well, there's more than one opinion out there about what zone 2 should be.\n\nIf you use a smartwatch or other device, go into the settings and set a custom heart rate (all the major brands can do this—check the instructions to find out where this setting lives.) The zones will usually populate automatically.\n\nAs I've written before, every device has a different idea of what should count as zone 2. If you'd like me to be the tiebreaker, I'd go with 60% to 75% of your max heart rate. So, multiply your estimated max heart rate by 0.6 to get the lower end of that zone, and 0.75 to get the higher end. For example, if your max heart rate is 200, your zone 2 is 120 to 150 beats per minute. If your max heart rate is 175, your zone 2 would be 105 to 132.\n\nI have good news for you: zone 3 has almost all the same benefits as zone 2. Don't view the top of zone 2 as a barrier thou shalt not cross; it's just a way of dividing easier exercise (zone 2) from medium intensity (zone 3). The more exercise you do, the more of it should stay in zone 2. Otherwise you could find yourself building up fatigue. After a zone 2 cardio session, you should feel good. You should feel like you totally could have done more, but you're saving some energy for tomorrow.\n\nSo if you have a hard time staying in zone 2, don't beat yourself up about it. Just try to keep your effort level low, on average, so you're still fresh for the next workout. As you get fitter, you'll find it easier to stay in zone 2.\n\nRunners often have trouble with this, because the dividing line between walking and running is sometimes too high to maintain an easy pace while you’re running, if you’re a beginner. The next best thing is to jog as slow as you can, and when you start to feel out of breath, switch to a brisk walk. For some people, a brisk walk for the whole session is a perfect zone 2 workout. As you get more fit, easy jogging will become possible.\n\nHere’s a real world example of how to keep a zone 2 pace: if I’m heading out for an easy run, I start at a nice chill jogging pace. But I live in a hilly neighborhood, so pretty soon I’ll be chugging up a hill and notice my breathing getting heavier. At this point, if my heart rate is getting higher than I'd like for this workout, I switch to a power walk. Jogging the flats and walking the uphills is a great way to keep your effort level steady, instead of accidentally turning your easy jog into a hill sprint workout.\n\nCyclists often measure their training in a seven-zone system that is based on how much power, in a physics sense, you are putting into the gears of your bike. These are called Coggan power zones, and bike training systems like Zwift and Peloton use the same basic idea. To calibrate these zones, you’ll take an FTP (functional threshold power) test—basically, a 20-minute race against yourself. From there, you (or your training app) calculates wattage numbers for your zones.\n\nZones 2 and 3 in this system usually correspond to our “zone 2” cardio. (Your heart rate at the end of an FTP test will be pretty close to your max heart rate, by the way, if you really went all-out.) If you train with both a heart rate monitor and a bike power meter, don’t worry if they don’t match exactly. A ride in power zones 2 and 3 will meet your low-intensity cardio needs, even if your heart rate starts in zone 1 and spikes into zone 3 by the end.\n\nFor other forms of cardio, go by feel, or by heart rate if you truly know your heart rate percentages. When you’re on the elliptical or the rower or the airbike, you should feel like you could carry on a conversation easily, and stop because time is up rather than because you’re running out of gas.",

    "description": "The scam uses a simple device link to hijack accounts.",
    "fullText": "If you use WhatsApp, you may be targeted by scammers looking to take over your account by pairing their browser to your number. This scheme, dubbed GhostPairing by researchers, uses WhatsApp's device linking process to allow fraudsters to access all of your messages, impersonate you in chats, and perpetuate the scam to your contacts. Here's how threat actors are hijacking WhatsApp accounts—and how to defend yours.\n\nWhatsApp allows users to link their desktop or browser to their account without needing to enter login credentials in one of two ways: scanning a QR code and approving the session or confirming a numeric pairing code in the mobile app. While the GhostPairing scam could theoretically manipulate users in either approach, researchers found that the latter is much more common.\n\nThe fraud begins with a short message sent from a contact with a link that purportedly goes to a Facebook photo or some type of Facebook content. If you click through, you'll be directed to a spoofed Facebook login page to enter your phone number—a familiar confirmation flow for Meta platforms. The next screen will likely show a numeric code with instructions to enter said code into WhatsApp to confirm the login (again, this may feel like a familiar two-step verification). If you're not paying attention, you may not realize that this didn't do anything on your end but instead registered the attacker's browser as a linked device to your account.\n\nThe danger in this scam is that everything will seem normal on your device and in your account, as attackers haven't hijacked your credentials to lock you out. However, they can do anything and everything in WhatsApp that you can, such as reading chats, receiving messages, viewing and downloading media, collecting information from your contacts, and forwarding the same phishing link. As they learn more about you and the people you know, they can potentially use that for ongoing scams.\n\nAs always, be wary of links received via messaging platforms, even if they seem harmless or you think you know and can trust the sender. Threat actors frequently use social media and direct messaging to spread phishing lures. If you do click a link in WhatsApp (or any other communication), read all prompts carefully before providing or verifying any information to identify scams.\n\nTo protect your WhatsApp account specifically, you can set up two-step verification, which will also prevent attackers from adding or changing a connected email address. Go to Settings > Account > Two-step verification > Turn on or Set up PIN and add an email address when prompted. You can also check to see if there are any suspicious devices paired with your account under Settings > Linked devices and remove any you don't recognize or regularly use.\n\nFinally, if you have been targeted by this scam, let your WhatsApp contacts know, as threat actors may spread the malicious link by making it look like it came from you.",

    "fullText": "Nottingham Forest have asked for the VAR audio as they consider making a formal complaint following the defeat by Manchester City.\n\nThe club are extremely unhappy with referee Rob Jones' decisions during Saturday's 2-1 loss at the City Ground.\n\nForest have gone to the referees' body - the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) - to ask to hear the conversations between on-pitch officials and the video assistant referee team during key moments of the match.\n\nHead coach Sean Dyche felt Rayan Cherki's 83rd-minute winner should have been ruled out for a foul on Morgan Gibbs-White, and that Jones should have shown City defender Ruben Dias a second yellow card after the break.\n\n\"Such an easy game to referee, in my opinion, such an easy decision for VAR,\" Dyche said on Saturday.\n\n\"When you played so well, to come in and have to talk about officials affecting the game - but they clearly did.\n\n\"Everyone in the stadium and everyone watching at home could see that.\"\n\nForest players complained to referee Jones, arguing Gibbs-White had been pushed by Nico O'Reilly while defending a corner and therefore stopped from blocking Cherki's winner.\n\n\"Morgan Gibbs-White quite clearly gets pushed to the floor and the same player is involved in blocking the ball,\" Dyche said.\n\n\"But he can't block it because as he jumps up, it goes through the bit of his body which he would have blocked it with. Whichever way you look at it, it's a foul.\"\n\nThe VAR checked the goal but allowed Jones' on-field decision to stand. Defeat left Forest five points above the Premier League's relegation zone.\n\nThe PGMOL has previously played audio privately to clubs - including Forest - while PGMOL chief refereeing officer Howard Webb also discusses incidents on the Mic'd Up programme.",
