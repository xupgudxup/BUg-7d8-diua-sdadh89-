    "fullText": "Chelsea have a problem now that their star player Cole Palmer and their £100m midfielder Enzo Fernandez are both fit.\n\nThey can’t both fit as a number 10 in Enzo Maresca’s team, but playing Enzo deeper weakens the team defensively. This exact point was picked up on the ESPN Gab and Juls show this week after the defeat to Aston Villa.\n\nEnzo Fernandez thinking he’s a fashion icon on Saudi TV.\n\n“You’ve always said he cannot play [in the pivot against big teams] I’m on the same page. I think Enzo Maresca is too… you have a serious problem. Unless you want to drop Cole Palmer or turn him into a winger or centre forward,” Gab Marcotti said.\n\nJulien Laurens explained his point in a little more detail:\n\n“In games like those last 30 minutes against Villa, games against Arsenal, City –  Enzo is just not mobile enough. He’s just not hard working enough. He’s not physical enough to be able to win that fight in midfield against players like Rice and Zubimendi or Rodri. I just think you have to carry Enzo in midfield in games like that and I think Maresca agrees with us, hence why you’ve seen Reece James in midfield in these games.”\n\nThese guys aren’t Chelsea fans, but they’re coming to the same conclusions that many of us already have. Enzo is too expensive to drop, but playing him either limits Palmer or compromises the team defensively.\n\nYou can see them discussing Enzo in the clip embedded here, with this chat coming after 6 minutes:\n\nGabs and Juls also discussed the general construction of this squad and how it has limited Enzo Maresca’s options in general.\n\nMarc Cucurella has spoken about our recent tough patch, and claimed that actually Chelsea fans and players should be proud of a positive year overall.",

    "fullText": "ARLINGTON, Texas — The Cotton Bowl certainly has gotten much more significant for Ohio State during three trips in a row to the game.\n\nThis time, the second-seeded Buckeyes (12-1) are defending national champions as they get ready to play College Football Playoff first-timer Miami (11-2, CFP No. 10 seed) in a quarterfinal here Wednesday night. The Cotton Bowl last January was a CFP semifinal when Ohio State beat Texas for the third of four wins needed last postseason for a sixth Associated Press national title.\n\nAs for the first of those appearances in North Texas two years ago, that was the last season before the CFP expanded from four to 12 teams and when it wasn’t the Cotton Bowl’s turn as one of the playoff games. The Buckeyes arrived then coming off a regular season-ending loss to rival Michigan after a 10-0 start. Their starting quarterback (Kyle McCord) had transferred and NFL-bound All-American receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. opted out of playing in what was a 14-3 loss to Missouri.\n\n“Just more stakes than the first game I’ve ever played in here. ... Now it’s a bowl game with the playoffs on the line, so it just means more,” senior receiver Carnell Tate said Monday on the field at AT&T Stadium.\n\n“It wasn’t CFP, so I felt like the job was not accomplished. We kind of fell short of our initial goal, and then when we played here, our quarterback ended up transferring. It was a whole lot of stuff going on,” senior cornerback Davison Igbinosun said. “It was definitely a tough game. It really didn’t feel like a typical Ohio State game, and then here last year and back in the playoffs, and that was a great game.”\n\nOhio State hasn’t played since losing 13-10 to No. 1 Indiana in the Big Ten Championship Game matchup of undefeated teams on Dec. 6, and still got a first-round bye.\n\nMiami, which is 24 years removed from its last national title, made its CFP debut with a 10-3 win in the first round at No. 7 seed Texas A&M on Dec. 20. The Hurricanes made the 12-team playoff field even after not making the ACC title game and that league’s champ (five-loss Duke) not getting a bid.\n\nWhen the Hurricanes left Dallas after a 26-20 overtime loss at SMU on Nov. 1, their second loss in three games after a 5-0 start, they weren’t even sure they would make the playoff. Now they are back in Texas for their second playoff game in a row and with another five-game winning streak.\n\n“That was a low point for us in the season, and in that locker room, it was as simple as a decision has to be made,” Miami coach Mario Cristobal said. “It came down to the simplicity of taking all the clips of us in our first five games and putting it on a reel and just letting it play. No audio, no one’s talking, no nothing. Just shut the lights, remind ourselves of who we are. And there’s nothing more powerful than the power of choice.”\n\nHeisman Trophy finalist Julian Sayin with Ohio State and Miami’s Carson Beck have both been part of national championship teams. Now the two most accurate Football Bowl Subdivision passers are trying to win a title as a starting quarterback.\n\nSayin was the Buckeyes’ backup last year behind Will Howard. Beck transferred to Miami after being at Georgia from 2020-24, when he was a youngster on the Bulldogs’ back-to-back national championship teams in 2021 and 2022 — he did get some late snaps in that second title game, a 65-7 romp over TCU.\n\nThe Cotton Bowl will be the first CFP game for Sayin, the sophomore who has thrown for 3,323 yards with 31 TDs and six interceptions. He has completed 78.4% of his passes (279 of 356). Beck made his first CFP start going 14-of-20 for 103 yards and a touchdown on a windy day in College Station. He has completed 74.5% of his passes (277 of 372) for 3,175 yards, 26 TDs and 10 interceptions.\n\nMiami’s last shot at back-to-back national championships ended in a double-overtime loss to Ohio State in the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 3, 2003, before most of the current players were born and the only other time these teams have met in a bowl game.\n\nOhio State, which won the first CFP national championship at AT&T Stadium at the end of the 2014 season, is now trying to win consecutive national titles for the first time. The Buckeyes are in their seventh CFP overall, and are the only team to appear in five of the last seven — all of those since Ryan Day became their head coach.\n\nThe only other time the Hurricanes played in the Cotton Bowl was at the end of the 1990 season, their last as an independent before moving to the Big East. They beat Texas 46-3 in Cotton Bowl Stadium.\n\nNO. 10 MIAMI VS. NO. 2 OHIO STATE\n\nCotton Bowl, 7:30 Wednesday, Arlington, Texas\n\nTV: ESPN Line/OU: Ohio State by 9 ½; 40 ½",

    "fullText": "ESPN analyst calls for Giants to draft Fernando Mendoza or Dante Moore over building up Jaxson Dart originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFormer Alabama quarterback and ESPN analyst Greg McElroy believes the New York Giants should consider a pivot at quarterback. Even after spending a first-round pick on Jaxson Dart just one year ago, is it time to move on?\n\nDuring Tuesday's episode of Get Up, McElroy said he would prioritize the long-term upside of college quarterbacks Fernando Mendoza and Dante Moore rather than committing fully to Dart.\n\n“Right now, I would go with the upside that you get with Dante Moore and Fernando Mendoza,” McElroy said. He called Dart a “high-floor prospect” with mechanical inconsistencies that may limit his ceiling.\n\nThe Giants selected Dart with the No. 25 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft. After beginning the season behind Russell Wilson, Dart took over as the starter in Week 4 and has shown flashes, particularly as a dual-threat runner. In Sunday’s win over the Las Vegas Raiders, Dart completed 22 of 30 passes for 207 yards and added 48 rushing yards and two touchdowns.\n\nBut McElroy raised concerns about Dart’s durability and processing speed, noting his physical style has already resulted in a concussion. He questioned whether Dart can elevate those around him, as he did at Ole Miss, or whether he needs an elite supporting cast.\n\nMcElroy compared Dart’s path to quarterbacks such as Brock Purdy and Jalen Hurts, while maintaining Mendoza and Moore offer greater long-term upside.\n\nWith New York potentially drafting near the top in 2026, McElroy’s comments add to a growing debate over the Giants’ future at quarterback. Obviously, there will need to be a conversation with a new head coach coming in soon.\n\nMichigan’s Biff Poggi warns up to 25 players may not return after Christmas break\n\nOregon's Dan Lanning rips College Football Playoff, calls for major changes\n\nDeion Sanders buyout, contract details as Colorado Buffaloes coach\n\nESPN's grade for LSU hiring Lane Kiffin will make Ole Miss fans even more mad\n\nWhy Diego Pavia attorneys are fighting the NCAA for seventh year of eligibility",

He returned to the college ranks as UCLA’s coach from 2018-23, leading the Bruins to a 35–34 record. He was offensive coordinator at Ohio State under Ryan Day last year, helping the Buckeyes win the national championship.\n\n“This program and university are clearly on the rise, and the values of the people and this place align with my own,” he said in a statement. “I am grateful for the opportunity. There is tremendous potential under Coach Braun’s leadership, and I’m ready to contribute to this team.”\n\nKelly was the most prominent assistant hired by Pete Carroll in his first season as Las Vegas' coach after leading the Seattle Seahawks for 14 years. He reportedly received a $6 million contract, the highest for an NFL offensive coordinator. But he never lived up to the deal. Las Vegas' offense ranked among the NFL's worst when he was fired.\n\nEven so, Northwestern coach David Braun called hiring Kelly “a program-defining change” that “is reflective of our long-term commitment to the pursuit of championships\" in a statement.\n\nThe Wildcats are 19-19 in three seasons under Braun. They went 7-6 this year and beat Central Michigan in the GameAbove Sports Bowl.\n\nNorthwestern is set to move into a new stadium next season after playing home games the past two years at a temporary lakefront facility and at Wrigley Field.\n\n\"This is a seminal moment for our program under David Braun’s direction and another indication that we are prepared to pursue the highest standard of excellence in all that we do,” athletic director Mark Jackson said in a statement.\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New England Patriots have enjoyed a dream season, with Drake Maye emerging as a potential NFL MVP, and the addition of veteran WR Stefon Diggs has been as significant a factor as any.\n\nThe Patriots took a gamble by signing Diggs to a multi-year deal fresh off an ACL tear in Houston, but the 32-year-old has rewarded New England by starting every game and serving as a steady hand in Maye's receiving corps.\n\nAs the Patriots prepare for the playoffs, criminal charges against Diggs threaten to hang over the team.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the charges Diggs is facing.\n\nNFL Week 18 picks against the spread\n\nDiggs was charged with felony strangulation or suffocation and misdemeanor assault and battery as a result of an incident that allegedly took place on Dec. 2, Boston 25 News reported.\n\nDiggs' arraignment is scheduled for Jan. 23, though his lawyers were in court for a hearing Tuesday to try to delay the court date until March. Diggs' lawyers also asked a judge to keep the police record on the case sealed, Boston 25 News said.\n\nThe Patriots released a statement Tuesday explaining Diggs \"categorically denies the allegations\" and pledging to cooperate with authorities and the NFL:\n\n\"The New England Patriots are aware of the accusations that have been made regarding Stefon Diggs. Stefon has informed the organization that he categorically denies the allegations. We support Stefon. We will continue to gather information and will cooperate fully with the appropriate authorities and the NFL as necessary.

We have no further comment at this time.\"\n\nDiggs has 970 yards and four touchdowns through 16 games this season, hauling in 82 of his 99 targets. He leads the NFL in targets, receptions and receiving yards, and he is coming off back-to-back 100-yard games.\n\nMoney is on the line for Diggs in Week 18, assuming he plays, as he is 30 yards away from a $500,000 bonus and eight catches away from another $500,000.\n\nMORE:Updated playoff picture ahead of Week 18\n\nThe details of the case, including where it allegedly took place and who might have been involved, are not yet clear. Diggs' lawyers petitioned a judge to keep the police records sealed. The judge is considering the motion.\n\nThe alleged incident took place on Dec. 2, one day after the Patriots defeated the Giants on \"Monday Night Football.\"\n\nDiggs was formally charged in the case, though he did not appear in court Tuesday and will not be arraigned until Jan. 23. Diggs' lawyers petitioned to move the arraignment to March, though she has not yet made a ruling.\n\nMORE:Breaking down the Matthew Stafford vs. Drake Maye MVP debate\n\nThe NFL typically waits until legal cases are resolved before issuing suspensions, which is why Kansas City Chiefs WR Rashee Rice wasn't suspended until 2025 for an incident that occurred in March 2024.\n\nAs long as that precedent stands, there isn't any reason to expect Diggs to be suspended by the league at any point this season.\n\nThe only exception could be a scenario in which Diggs is placed on the Commissioner's Exempt List, which the NFL describes as \"a special player status available to clubs only in unusual circumstances.\" Use of the Commissioner's Exempt List is rare, but it can allow a player to not count against a team's 53-man roster while facing serious criminal charges.\n\nAt this time, there is no reason to believe the NFL is considering placing Diggs on the Commissioner's Exempt List, meaning he is eligible to continue playing.\n\nThe Patriots issued a statement on Tuesday addressing the charges against Diggs:\n\n\"The New England Patriots are aware of the accusations that have been made regarding Stefon Diggs. Stefon has informed the organization that he categorically denies the allegations. We support Stefon. We will continue to gather information and will cooperate fully with the appropriate authorities and the NFL as necessary.

    "fullText": "Sorry, there was nothing posted yesterday. We hit the day between Christmas and New Year’s when friends and I had finished family time and had a friend’s time, which was very nice. And I tasted what I was told was Turkish whiskey, but as it was home-made (brought to Canada in a plastic Coke bottle), I’d call it moonshine. It was strong, and the first taste was a shock to the system, but it wasn’t bad. Not saying that it is something I’d want to have in my cupboard, but it didn’t make me blind.\n\nAnd, let’s face it, we are at the point of the off-season where there is no news and no rumours. The closest to a rumour is that Kazuma Okamoto has to sign with someone by January 4th, or he’ll be playing in Japan. The Jays have spoken with his representatives and will be among the teams to meet with him. I very much doubt they will really be in on him. My understanding is that he is a corner infielder who really can’t play third well enough for the Jays to plan to use him there for the next several years. He has power, hitting .327/.416/.598 with 15 homers in 69 games last year, missing time with a knee injury.\n\nBeyond that, writer Francys Romero suggested that the Jays are interested in Yoán Moncada. He hit .234/.336/.448 with 12 home runs in 84 games with the Angels in 2025. Adding in his less than awesome defense, I’m pretty sure the team would rather roll with Ernie Clement and/or Addison Barger at the position.\n\nThe team is still interested in Alex Bregman, Bo Bichette and Kyle Tucker.\n\nI’ve always thought the Bo was going to listen to all offers and then go back to the Jays to see if they would match the best offer. That’s what I’d do if I were him (and if I wanted to continue to play for the Jays).\n\nBregman seems like a long shot to me. If I had to bet, I’d put money on him returning to the Red Sox.\n\nTucker? Well, if he wants to be a Blue Jay, I think the team would be willing to play what it takes to get him. It messes up their outfield somewhat, but, as much as I like Nathan Lukes, I’d take Tucker and see what I could get in trade for Lukes (I’m assuming not all that much, but a bullpen arm or prospect would work).\n\nZach Eflin re-signed with the Orioles. He might miss the first few days of the season after back surgery this winter. Their rotation will be Kyle Bradish, Trevor Rogers, Shane Baz and Dean Kremer, with Eflin.\n\nThe A’s, breaking with their norm, have signed Tyler Soderstrom to a seven-year, $86 million contract. There is a team option for an extra year and incentives. If he’s with the team for seven years, he may see the A’s break ground on the stadium in Las Vegas.\n\nDevon White turned 63 yesterday. I figured I’d have time to put something up about it, but the day got away from me. He’s the best defensive outfielder I’ve ever watched (though Varsho is pretty close). Five of his 17 seasons and 22.3 of his career 47.3 bWAR were with the Jays.\n\nHe was a one-and-done in Hall of Fame voting. I’d guess that if he were on the ballot now, he’d get some votes. Maybe enough to get on the ballot for a second time.\n\nHopefully, we’ll get some real news or even real rumours soon. I hate this time of the off-season when news dries up. What we should do is turn the site into an Aussie Rules Football site for December.",

With the Illini’s three-level attack on full display and the defense also keeping a high-scoring Penn State offense at bay, the Illini cruised to a 91-52 victory.\n\nIllinois (12-3, 4-1 Big Ten) outdid Penn State (12-4, 2-3 Big Ten) in every aspect of the game, and the win came despite the Illini being without the quarterback of their offense.\n\nIn the hour before tipoff, it was revealed that star guard Kasparas Jakucionis would be out with a left forearm injury. With one seemingly NBA-bound prospect out, another stepped up. Freshman Will Riley got the nod to start, shifting the lineup to a taller one.\n\nThat meant that point guard duties were handed to Kylan Boswell, who for the better part of this season has been the team’s secondary ball handler.\n\n“Poise and patience,” is what Underwood said Boswell brought in KJ’s absence. “It’s nice when you’ve got two of them in KJ and him that can do that and control a game from that standpoint. I got a little uncomfortable when he picked up one [foul] really early, but he’s smart. He’s cerebral. He knew exactly what we were trying to do.”\n\nWith the ball in Boswell’s hands, the game flowed naturally for Underwood’s side of the sideline.\n\n“We literally ran two plays tonight,” he said. “We didn’t have to run much, but he just makes the right reads and I thought he was sensational.”\n\nAfter the game, Brad Underwood said that Jakucionis was struggling with some inflammation in his left forearm, an issue that had been nagging him since the game at Washington. He said there was no timetable yet for a return, and that they haven’t spoken to doctors yet.",

    "description": "What’s going to happen in women’s basketball in 2026? Here are five things we hope to see.",
    "fullText": "2025 was another banner year for women’s basketball.\n\nIt began with an again active WNBA free agency period that reshuffled rosters and created new contenders, resulting in a season that, both unexpectedly and expectedly, ended with another M’VP for A’ja Wilson and another championship for the Las Vegas Aces.\n\nUnrivaled enjoyed a successful debut season, immediately emerging as a viable and vivacious source of offseason hoops, while Athletes Unlimited likewise entertained fans during its first season in Nashville. Overseas, a surefire Fenerbahçe title was not, as Praha powered its way back to the top in EuroLeague Women. And in the NCAA, UConn re-established their dominance, with the Huskies capturing their first title in nearly a decade.\n\nWhat’s in store for 2026? Here are Swish Appeal’s five wishes for the WNBA, Unrivaled, NCAA, Athletes Unlimited and EuroLeague Women:\n\nThis one’s simple. There’s no room for any other WNBA wishes—from free agency signings to draft picks to top teams to award winners to a champion—without a season.\n\nThat said, the burden is not on the players to eventually cave to the league in order to satisfy fans’ desires. It seems like the league might be content with trying to run out the clock, refusing to engage with many of the players’ asks and hoping that, when the clock strikes midnight on the final CBA deadline, the players will give in.\n\nPlayers getting what they deserve—from higher salaries to an appreciating revenue sharing model to other quality of life benefits—is the prerequisite to a season. So, after the players secure the CBA win that they are worthy of, we’ll start dreaming of all the free agency fireworks, rookie debuts, stat-stuffing play from stars, clutch-time heroics and, for better or worse, unnecessary antics to come.\n\nOne of the bigger unknowns entering the first season of Unrivaled was whether players would approach games with seriousness. Would the league assume more of a pick-up vibe, with most players choosing not to go all out? Or, would a culture of competition develop, where players exhibited a feistiness and fire?\n\nThe latter, fortunately, materialized more often than not. The full court 3×3 setting, where players’ mistakes are amplified, resulted in engaged and intense basketball. The care factor and competitive desire were evident, particularly through the chippiness not that emerged between Lunar Owls and Rose. Furthermore, it was encouraging to see players demonstrate that off-court camaraderie could coexist with on-court animosities.\n\nLet’s have more of all that in Season 2! What new rivalries will develop? What opponents will Lunar Owls be hootie hoo-ing at? And which opponents will be hooting back at Owls? How will Rose project their championship swagger? Will the newbies, Breeze and Hive, look to stir up new dramas?\n\nYes, March Madness is supposed to be about upsets. Busted brackets! Cinderellas! Unexpected heroes!\n\nAnd sure, all that’s fun. But oftentimes, early-round upsets reduce later-round drama. The underdog that pulls off an improbable win or two eventually falls in uncompetitive fashion to a clearly superior opponent.\n\nThis women’s college basketball season thus far has been defined by a clear top five: No. 1 UConn, No. 2 Texas, No. 3 South Carolina, No. 4 UCLA and No. 5 LSU.\n\nFour of those five squads need to compose the Final Four in Phoenix. The best must go through the best in order to win it all. Of course, as the above picture reminds, matchups between the teams considered to be the top dogs also do not always deliver. In the 2025 Final Four, No. 2-seed UConn routed No. 1-seed UCLA before doing the same to another in No. 1-seed South Carolina.\n\nHowever, seeing the Huskies repeat the feat in 2026 or witnessing one of the Longhorns, Gamecocks, Bruins or Tigers push them to the brink, or even topple them, will be the ideal outcome for this college season.\n\nRather than a wish, this might be a guarantee.\n\nIn her 14th WNBA season at age 36, Tina Charles played in 43 of 44 games for the Connecticut Sun, averaging 16 points as she logged almost 30 minutes per game, all while adding to her all-time ranking on the league’s scoring (second) and rebounding (first) lists. She also further established herself as the W’s ultimate vet, consistently sharing in-game secrets and postgame praise for the league’s up and comers.\n\nNow, Charles takes all those talents to Nashville, making her Athletes Unlimited debut. It not only will be fun to see Charles show off her timeless scoring touch, but also bless AU youngsters with her wizened and tested insights. And, it won’t be too surprising if TC adds AU Champion to her illustrious resume!\n\nEric Nemchock, our EuroLeague Women expert, just declared Spar Girona to be a real title contender.\n\nA big reason why? Justē Jocytē. While the Golden State Valkyries’ decision to make the then-19-year-old Lithuanian the franchise’s first-ever draft pick might have puzzled some, Jocytē‘s play for Girona in EuroLeague Women is, yet again, proving the Valkyries to be prescient.\n\nThe 6-foot-0 now 20-year-old profiles an a near-ideal modern offensive player. She is big guard who can handle, pass and shoot lights out from behind the arc. She’s shooting 40 percent from 3 on over six attempts per game in EuroLeague Women contests, while also averaging almost five assists. It’s easy to envision her slotting into the Golden State offense, serving as a salve who generates efficient opportunities through her actual shot, the threat of her shot and her passing chops.\n\nBefore then, expect her game to continue to sharpen, hopefully so much so that Girona gives Fenerbahçe a real foe in the EuroLeague Women playoffs.\n\nJocytē’s future plans, however, suggests 2026 could introduce new uncertainties for EuroLeague Women.\n\nNot only could a new WNBA CBA institute harsher prioritization provisions that discourage players from participating in EuroLeague, a circumstance possibly aided by the league reportedly considering an earlier training camp start date, but the launch of Project B threatens to pluck players. Jocytē has been announced as a Project B signee, as has Valencia’s Leonie Fiebich and Praha’s Janelle Salaün. Unrivaled also has enticed players away from EuroLeague clubs, with Jocytē‘s Girona teammate, Laeticia Amihere, departing the club for Unrivaled. Ezi Magbegor, a member of Praha last season, opted for Unrivaled over a return to the defending champs.\n\nAs Eric consistently emphasizes, EuroLeague Women is the premier European women’s basketball competition. It would be a shame if the growth of the sport—whether fueled by Project B, and its vision for a more glamorous international competition, or the WNBA, and its desire for exclusivity—came at the EuroLeague’s expense.",

    "title": "Secret Superstars 2025: Jer’Zhan Newton finally finds his groove in soon-to-be-forgotten Commanders season",
    "description": "Jer'Zhan (Johnny) Newton was supposed to be the Commanders’ next great interior pass-rusher. It’s taken longer than expected, but Newton’s formidable tools appear to be kicking in.",
    "fullText": "Throughout the 2025 NFL season, SB Nation’s Doug Farrar writes about the game’s Secret Superstars — those players whose performances might slip under the radar for whatever reasons. In this installment, we focus on Washington Commanders defensive lineman Jer’Zhan {Johnny) Newton, who seems to finally be living up to his potential for a franchise that could use every bit of good news it can get right now.\n\nThe 2025 season is not something that anybody involved with the Washington Commanders wanted — or expected. A year after Jayden Daniels enjoyed perhaps the greatest rookie season any quarterback has ever had, and the Dan Quinn-led team made it all the way to the NFC Championship game, the Commanders fell back to earth with a 4-12 record that looks far too much like the 4-13 mark the franchise put up in 2023, before Quinn and Daniels mercifully arrived.\n\nThe reasons are the reasons — injuries (especially to Daniels), coaching and personnel issues (especially on defense), and a general malaise that did not in any way infect the building the year before — and now, it’s all about looking forward to 2026.\n\nOne thing the Commanders will need in 2026 is an improved pass rush. This season, Von Miller leads the team with nine sacks, Jacob Martin leads the team with 41 total pressures, and outside of those two gentlemen, no other Commanders defender has more than 30 quarterback disruptions — that’s Javon Kinlaw with 30 on the nose, and no sacks to speak of.\n\nOne guy who was supposed to lead the pack, at least on the interior, was second-year man Jer’Zhan Newton, the 2024 second-round pick from Illinois. I tend to have a bias towards smaller interior defensive linemen who can wreak havoc with the “low man wins” philosophy — this goes from John Randle to Geno Atkins to Grady Jarrett to Aaron Donald — and when I watched the 6’2, 295-pound Newton’s college tape, I thought he was the next in line. I assumed that the Commanders committed outright theft when they were able to pick Newton with the 36th overall pick in the second round.\n\nJohnny (Jer'Zhan) Newton, DL, Illinois\n\nPLUSES\n\n— Capable of pressure from every gap; spends most of his time at 3-tech, but he's a disruptor all over the place\n— Gets skinny through gaps like a running back would; gets it done with more than just pass-rush moves\n— Violent… pic.twitter.com/MjVIqxDdI6\n\n— Doug Farrar ✍ (@NFL_DougFarrar) February 24, 2024\n\nBut outside of a few flashes, Newton hadn’t lived up to that positive potential in the NFL. Injuries and the transition to the pros put an unexpected ceiling on his profile, and through Washington’s Christmas Day game against the Dallas Cowboys, he had amassed just two sacks and 19 total pressures in his second season, after putting up two sacks and 23 total pressures in his first.\n\nThere are those who will tell you that pass-rushers generally need a full season or more to adapt to the NFL and its better blockers and more advanced protection schemes. Only those in that aforementioned building could tell you why it’s taken as long as it has for the light to come on for Newton, but it most definitely did against Dallas in the Commanders’ 30-23 loss. Newton absolutely went off before a national television audience, with four sacks and six total pressures in 27 pass-rushing snaps. Basically, everybody in the middle or on the right side of the Cowboys’ offensive line was in for a very, very long day.\n\nIf you were in the middle or on the right side of the Cowboys' offensive line on Christmas Day, Jer'Zhan Newton (no. 95) was going to fill your stocking with coal, and cans of whoop-ass. pic.twitter.com/iiYos5G4q0\n\n— Doug Farrar ✍ (@NFL_DougFarrar) December 30, 2025\n\nWhether he had his shoulders square or in a tilted alignment, one-tech or three-tech, in one-on-ones or against double teams, Newton was out for blood, and it showed up over and over on the tape. This was the Jer’Zhan Newton I thought I’d see in the NFL.\n\nQuinn was asked about the difference now following the Cowboys game, and his response was both highly detailed and extremely interesting.\n\n“I think the disruption, the quickness, so those are the skills that he has,” Quinn said when asked about his increased confidence in the second-year man. “And so, to hear him put all the pieces together, anticipation of plays, how to go execute it to go, I felt that. And some of that’s instinctual to go, ‘It’s pass, it’s a run, where can I go?‘ It does take some time to learn that. And when you do as a ballplayer, the game slows down because now you can anticipate a little better. I know the defensive call, I got that. Now how can I apply my skills into this call?\n\n“What you don’t want, we had some of this early in the year, ‘I’ll go make a play, I’ll go overtry on one.’ And that’s part of instincts, knowing when and when not to. Much like a quarterback, ‘Can I fit this one in or can’t I?” on a tight throw. It’s no different at other positions. ‘Do I go take my shot to run through? Can I notice to pass, to hit a move?’ So, to see those instincts come through and it can slow down.\n\n“You’re so ready to get going to go get another possession, and so to finish with under 45 plays, you don’t get enough cracks at that. And so, those are significant changes in it, double the amount of plays. And so, yeah, it does have an effect, not an effect of morale or that, just not enough cracks at bat. And so, I think it’s definitely a factor in the game but not in the emotional pull. It’s more if you’re on the offensive or defensive side that’s either converting, not converting, those are a bigger pull or factor, I think.”\n\nThe Cowboys game marked the first time since Week 18 of the 2024 season that Newton had more than 20 pass-rushing snaps in a game, so that’s obviously a thing now.\n\n“Yeah, always happy for opportunity,” Newton said after the game. “I was talking to [WR Robbie] Chosen, and he was like, just always be grateful of every opportunity that you get, even in a meeting. So, I feel like that stuck with me since last night. I got a brother who would kill to be in this position. So that stuck with me all day. And I was like—since the morning—I was like, ‘Man, I just got to go in there and ball out, because I know my brother would do the same if he had the opportunity.’”\n\nNewton has four brothers: Jervon, Jerquan, Jerjuan, and Jershaun. Jerjuan Newton played receiver for the Toledo Rockets from 2019 through 2024, totaling 206 catches on 324 targets for 2,901 yards and 32 touchdowns. He was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Denver Broncos in 2025, but didn’t make final cuts.\n\nJerjuan Newton was a great receiver for the Toledo Rockets, was signed by the Broncos as a UDFA in 2025, and didn't make the final roster. Jer'Zhan Newton has said that his brother would kill for his opportunity, and that drives him. pic.twitter.com/usnWTqjNFn\n\n— Doug Farrar ✍ (@NFL_DougFarrar) December 30, 2025\n\nNo matter the reason for Newton’s advancement, the Commanders obviously hope it will stick and stay in 2026 and beyond. The franchise has enough to address; having the boss three-tech Newton can be would check one very important item off the list.",

    "description": "UFC analysts, fighters and coaches offer theories on why spinning back elbow knockouts were more common in 2025.",
    "fullText": "Just like any other sport, high-level competition in MMA is subject to trends. One of the big ones in 2025 was the rise in spinning back elbow knockouts.\n\nOne-fifth of all spinning back elbow knockouts in UFC history happened over the past 12 months, with PFL also cashing in spectacular highlights courtesy of the technique and various other promotions around the globe, as well.\n\nIs it simply a coincidence? Almost certainly not.\n\nyear of the spinning elbow pic.twitter.com/CVxo6bQ1Gq\n\n— Dovy🔌 (@DovySimuMMA) October 16, 2025\n\nThe two UFC fights that ended by spinning elbow knockout happened in August, in back-to-back fights no less, when Carlos Prates halted Geoff Neal and Lerone Murphy flattened Aaron Pico at UFC 319.\n\nThere was also Diego Lopes' finish of Jean Silva at Noche UFC a few weeks later, which wasn't technically registered as a spinning back elbow knockout, but the knockdown that led to the finish was a product of one.\n\n\"It's not luck,\" UFC welterweight and analyst Michael Chiesa told MMA Junkie. \"From UFC 319 to Noche UFC, we saw three spinning back elbow knockouts. That's not luck. I think we're going into this phase of another paradigm shift in this sport where we've seen styles have more success, and now we're in this phase where elite athletes know how to fight from a technical standpoint. Now guys are going to stop pressure with spinning elbows.\"\n\nThere are still too few knockouts of this kind to draw conclusive data points from the fight style for the victims of the technique, or the ones dishing it out. However, there is enough to begin to draw some conclusions, and retired lightweight contender Paul Felder, who now serves as a UFC commentator and analyst, is beginning to see them.\n\nFelder knows a thing or two about spinning for a knockout. He has one of the 11 knockouts in UFC history stemming from a spinning backfist, which may seem like a similar technique but has differences. The backfist used to be more commonly seen, but Felder said there's a benefit to shortening the leash and using the elbow instead, particularly against grapplers.\n\n\"I just think guys are committing to it more, especially against wrestlers,\" Felder said. \"If they're going to get on your hips and try to close that distance and level change on you anyway, you might as well just go for it. Especially when guys are trying to close the distance really fast, it creates huge opportunities for that. I think guys are just getting more skillful and more well rounded at it. It used to be the spinning backfist, and now we're seeing it tighter. It's hard to throw that spinning backfist. You can break your arm. There's a lot more wrist to it. I broke my arm throwing a spinning backfist.\"\n\nFelder's point about in-fight commitment appears to hold some underlying significance. A full-force spinning back elbow is not a technique that can be routinely trained in the gym during live sparring. The risk of significant impact and/or cuts is high, which proves the potential consequences if it occurs in a real fight.\n\nFighters are training it inside the gym, though, and it's only highlighting the value in knowing how to do it well. Syndicate MMA head coach John Wood doesn't put an added emphasis on preparing his athletes to use spinning elbows, though, because before long, a counter will come around that renders them less dangerous.\n\n\"We had a UFC fighter in here today doing sparring rounds, and he dropped and stopped someone with a spinning elbow,\" Wood said. \"It was beautiful. Those are the things that are hard to train in practice. He had a big elbow pad on, but it hit just perfect. You've got to be careful throwing those things, but there's a time and place for everything.\n\n\"The calf kick didn't evolve until a couple years ago, and now people are starting to know how to defend, so you're seeing it less and less. Sometimes they still work, but if you check a calf kick, it hurts. Everything is on the table, and that's the good and the bad in MMA.\"\n\nFinding consistent success in MMA ultimately comes down to being unpredictable, efficient and effective. Just like any spinning technique that involves even slightly turning the back to an opponent, there can be downside that comes in a swift and violent manner.\n\nThe upside if it lands, however, is a knockout that could be a viral highlight, set up post-fight bonuses and add traction to a fighter's name. It's all about throwing with confidence and taking the chance, and there's few better to preach that than veteran lightweight Edson Barboza, who landed arguably the greatest spinning finish in UFC history, with his iconic wheel kick knockout of Terry Etim at UFC 142 in January 2012.\n\n\"It was the same thing with the spinning wheel kick,\" Barboza said. \"You didn't see it much, but when I did it, everyone started trying, and it started working. All technique starts working when the people do it. I think people have started looking and go, 'This is working.' They start practicing this a little more, and that's exactly what happened. It's worked more times. Everybody will now try. All the UFC fighters now try the spinning elbow. But I think more people just believe because it definitely works.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: Why the rise in spinning elbow KOs in 2025? Fighters, coaches explain",

    "fullText": "As Asa Newell tried to move the ball, a brainfart delivered Alex Caruso a late Christmas present. He had the easiest steal of his life when he cleanly intercepted a cross-court pass intended for Onyeka Okongwu. The 31-year-old jogged the other way for the Status of Liberty one-handed jam.\n\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder avoided an upset with a 140-129 win over the Atlanta Hawks. The high-scoring affair adds to the reigning NBA champions' recent trend of defensive letdowns.\n\nCaruso finished with 16 points on 7-of-8 shooting, eight rebounds and two assists. He shot 2-of-2 from 3. He also had two steals.\n\nYou usually don't see Caruso put up scoring numbers. At this point in his career, he's somebody who lets his plus-minus and tape do the talking. The two-time NBA champion doesn't need to get a ton of buckets to prove his value. But considering how optional defense was for the Hawks, you might as well join in on the fun.\n\nCaruso also had it easy inside the paint. He had several finishes at the rim. That helped him feel better about his outside jumpers. He even knocked down an impromptu mid-range shot. When he can knock down his outside looks, his unreal one-on-one defense is quite the compliment.\n\nThe Thunder went with Caruso in crunch time. Since he arrived in OKC, he's proven to be somebody that they rely on in those situations — even if he seldom starts. You saw that at the end when he out-hustled Krejci for a loose ball and created a scoring play out of pure nothingness.\n\nLook, what happened on Christmas will likely linger with Caruso until the playoffs. He went 2-of-12 from the outside in a shocking loss to the San Antonio Spurs. The ball was funneled to him by design as they dared him to beat them from the perimeter. The plan worked, but Thunder head coach Mark Daigneault is willing to eat that loss considering how big a gamer he is for those moments.\n\n\"The thing about that one is he started 0-for-8 and he shot 12 of them. There's not a lot of competitors out there that would shoot the seventh, the eighth, the ninth, the 10th, the 11th and the 12th. You have to be pretty mentally tough and lost in the competition,\" Daigneault said. \"He knows those are the right shots for the team. He doesn't care about the fact that the last one didn't go in. He keeps shooting them. That's why he's a great competitor.\"\n\nCaruso believes the same thing. He flat-out felt disrespected that folks might suggest that he pass out on quality looks. That's poison for an NBA offense. You work so hard to get a good look in the halfcourt. It'd be a waste to turn that down and hurt the rest of your teammates.\n\n\"I think the Christmas game was frustrating for me because I live for one or two games a year where I get 10 attempts and I'd like to be prepared to make them. I feel like I put the work in to be shooting well or at least better than I did in that game,\" Caruso said. \"Just trying to be consistent with the work I put in... I didn't go home and had a miserable Christmas, other than we lost and I was a little upset with that. Next day, got my treatment and got to work.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on OKC Thunder Wire: Alex Caruso won't let Christmas discourage him from taking open shots",

    "fullText": "Why Browns' Harold Fannin Jr. has ceiling of prime Travis Kelce originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThere might not be a better 2025 draft class than the one the Cleveland Browns put together. Carson Schwesinger,  Mason Graham, Quinshon Judkins, and Harold Fannin Jr. make up a remarkable rookie class.\n\nOne of the most impressive of this group is Fannin, the tight end. He's been a staple of the Browns' offense, and despite Cleveland's offense being a lackluster one, Fannin has shown he has what it takes to be an elite tight end.\n\nSo much so that ESPN analyst Ben Solak made a very bold comparison, believing that Fannin's ceiling is that of prime Travis Kelce, who's going to be a Hall of Famer.\n\n\"It's fair to expect him to become a Sam LaPorta-esque producer, and his ceiling is in the range of Trey McBride and prime Travis Kelce as team-leading target-getters who can be used at all three levels of the field.\"\n\nWhile Fannin still needs to prove his worth beyond his rookie season, what he's already put on tape is more than enough for fans to be very excited to see what he becomes going forward.\n\nHe's hauled in 72 receptions for 731 yards and six touchdowns this season. He's also added a singular rushing touchdown on a sneaky play.\n\nMore: Deion Sanders' reaction to Shedeur's terrible interception tells the whole story\n\nTo say that Fannin has been the best rookie tight end would be an understatement. Coleston Loveland and Tyler Warren are both great, but what Fannin has done this season, especially considering the situation around him, is remarkable.\n\nSolak believes he has the ceiling of one of the greatest tight ends ever in prime Kelce, and while it's a bold take, it might not be far from the truth.\n\nGive Fannin an elite offense, whether it's an improved offensive line or a star quarterback, and he could be putting up All-Pro numbers in year two.\n\nIn what was a draft class with a lot of interesting tight end options, Fannin might be the best one by far. He's Solak's first-team all-rookie tight end and is drawing comparisons to prime Kelce. Praise doesn't get much better than that for a tight end.\n\nMyles Garrett sacks tracker: Updated 2025 total for Browns star amid chase for NFL single-season record\n\nBrowns' Shedeur Sanders is under pressure more than any QB since 2009\n\n‘I’ll be damned': Myles Garrett reacts to the idea of Browns tanking\n\nDenzel Ward shades Steelers after game-saving coverage\n\nMyles Garrett slams Steelers offensive gameplan after Browns upset win\n\nMyles Garrett stats: Browns pass rusher held without a sack in upset over Steelers",

    "description": "Bobbins wraps up a trio of festive games in which one annoying theme came through.",
    "fullText": "So, that’s 2025 wrapped up and sealed with a bow. Not quite perfect with a 1-1 draw against Peterborough United, but seven points from nine over Christmas is, by our standards, practically a festive miracle.\n\nSince the last load of Bobbins – pre‑Luton Town – we’ve faced three sides who, supposedly, are among the better footballing teams in the division.\n\nLuton certainly looked it at times, slipping into the channels like they’d been given a map and a head start. Plymouth Argyle, despite their league position, still have a few players who remember what the Championship looks like. And Peterborough, under Luke Williams, appear to be in the early stages of becoming something functional.\n\nWe scored eight goals across those three games, which is lovely. It’s also the sort of thing that makes you suspicious, because nothing at Reading ever arrives without a catch.\n\n“Just one player taking half a second to think before launching the ball into a postcode only they can see. I’m not asking for tiki‑taka. Just… sanity”\n\nLeam Richardson deserves credit for improving our scoring output. Goals from open play, even a set‑piece routine that looked like it had been rehearsed rather than improvised: a rare treat. But, as ever, there’s a “but”.\n\nBasic ball control and ball-retention remain optional. Against Luton, the number of 50/50s we lost because the ball behaved like a startled animal was almost impressive in a bleak way. Luton didn’t even have to work that hard – they just waited for us to miscontrol something and then politely helped themselves to the counter-attack.\n\nThis isn’t new. It’s been a problem since the Paul Ince era and probably long before that. Maybe it’s the quality of the players. Maybe it’s the level we’re at. Maybe I simply notice our flaws more because I see them every week. Whatever the reason, I’d quite like to see less of it before I reach retirement age.\n\nA bit of composure wouldn’t go amiss. Just one player taking half a second to think before launching the ball into a postcode only they can see. I’m not asking for tiki‑taka. Just… sanity.\n\nNow, as 2026 looms, so does the January transfer window. Richardson has been clear since day one: he wants reinforcements. Not just more players – better ones. A bold ambition in League One, where “better” usually means “someone who can trap a ball without it bouncing into orbit”.\n\nOf course, this won’t be straightforward. A few minor obstacles stand in the way, such as:\n\nClubs not wanting to sell their good players in January, because, why would you? Unless you’re trying to get out of a war-torn country\n\nOur already full squad, which raises the question of who leaves, where they go and why they’d volunteer for that\n\nThe small matter of how much money Mr Couhig is actually willing to spend, beyond the vague promise of funds for “the right player”, whoever that mythical creature may be\n\nThe eternal debate about January spending, countered by the fact that this division is so chaotic that three wins could send us into the playoffs and three losses could send us into oblivion\n\nIt will be a test of the owners’ ambition, though ambition in football is always subject to the whims of agents, budgets, significant others and whether the player’s dog fancies the ‘Ding.\n\nWith 2025 behind us – a year of upheaval, drama and the occasional glimmer of hope – we now wait for the next evolution of the club.\n\nIt should be quieter than 2025. Then again, it’s Reading, we never do anything quietly.",

    "fullText": "What we know is that Maxx Crosby’s season is over with the Las Vegas Raiders.\n\nBut it’s clear that Crosby’s future will be a major topic of conversation during the offseason.\n\nThe Raiders, of course, placed Crosby on the injured reserve late last week because of a knee injury he has been dealing with since October. Crosby, though, was not pleased about the decision.\n\nHe left the team’s facility on Friday because he was reportedly upset. Crosby wasn’t at Sunday’s game, but Raiders coach Pete Carroll said he returned to the team’s facility Monday. Carroll has downplayed the situation. I was told by someone close to the situation Monday that isn’t as rosy as Carroll is making it sound.\n\nClearly, not all is great between the team and player. NFL Media reported Sunday that the situation will cause Crosby to evaluate his situation with the team and Jay Glazer reported that he has been in contact with Crosby and he “is not happy” and Glazer wondered if Crosby will seek an offseason trade.\n\nSo, it’s obvious this situation is fluid.\n\nIn the end, the Raiders are doing what is best for the team by protecting their investment in Crosby, who reportedly will need knee surgery after the season. Crosby, though, reportedly was told by outside doctors that he could finish the season if he could tolerate the pain. Crosby is a warrior. He wants to play.\n\nMaybe when the season, cooler heads will prevail. So, for now, this situation is on hold.\n\nHowever, I doubt we’ve seen the end of the Raiders-Crosby saga.",

    "fullText": "Dani Carvajal is about to enter the final six months of his contract at Real Madrid, leading to question marks about his future beyond this season.\n\nThe 33-year-old right-back’s recent trip to Qatar only served to fuel speculations that he might consider moving on in the summer to reunite with close friend, brother-in-law, and former teammate Joselu.\n\nSo far, there has been no move from the club’s side to initiate talks about an extension either, leading to major uncertainty over his future.\n\nHowever, according to AS, Carvajal’s future and continuity at Real Madrid beyond his current contract appears to be on track.\n\nIndeed, unlike Antonio Rudiger and David Alaba, who appear certain to leave, Carvajal can be relatively calm about his situation at Real Madrid, as he is seen as a ‘special case’.\n\nThe veteran right-back will turn 34 in January and has only been able to spend 445 minutes on the pitch over the past 15 months. And, so far, the club have not yet made a definitive decision on whether to offer him another year.\n\nSet to continue for one more year? (Photo by Juan Manuel Serrano Arce/Getty Images)\n\nHowever, due to his authority and importance in the dressing room as club captain and because, what he still has left to offer on a sporting level, despite the uncertainty surrounding his physical condition, the odds are in favour of his staying.\n\nMoreover, Real Madrid are not searching for a new right-back and are focusing on other positions ahead of the summer.\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold is still in the process of settling at the club, and using Federico Valverde as a right-back outside of emergency situations could once again provoke the Uruguayan’s displeasure.\n\nIn short, the current planning includes Carvajal as part of the project, especially as if he manages to halt his recent run of injuries and find continuity in 2026, he will further strengthen his case on the pitch.\n\nThe Real Madrid captain is working tirelessly to recover from his most recent serious physical problem, an issue in his knee which needed him to undergo arthroscopy in October.\n\nCarvajal is close to returning and could be included in the trip to Jeddah for the Spanish Super Cup. As for his continuity, it now seems more a matter of timing than of doubt.",

    "fullText": "ARLINGTON, Texas — Caleb Downs had to be reminded that he was getting ready for his sixth College Football Playoff game, which probably won’t be rare a decade from now but is unique in just the second year of the expanded 12-team format.\n\nThe Ohio State safety smiled at the thought and figured it couldn’t hurt to have played in the CFP as a freshman at Alabama, losing 27-20 to Michigan in overtime before transferring to the Wolverines’ biggest rival and winning four postseason games and a national championship with the Buckeyes a year ago.\n\n“That could be a positive, just knowing that I’ve been in this situation so many times,” said Downs, a two-time Associated Press All-American. “At the end of the day, it’s not about me. It’s about everybody else feeling confident during the game. Really just trying to push that to all my teammates.”\n\nHe’s talking younger teammates such as freshman Devin Sanchez, a backup cornerback who has tried to imagine the nerves and emotions in the hours before kickoff in a Cotton Bowl quarterfinal against No. 10 Miami.\n\nThe Hurricanes (11-2, CFP No. 10 seed) are first-time CFP qualifiers, but got a start on those nerves with the 10-3 first-round victory at Texas A&M on Dec. 20.\n\nThe third-ranked Buckeyes (12-1, CFP No. 2) got a first-round bye despite losing to top-ranked Indiana in the Big Ten championship game.\n\n“Lean on them a lot, more than you think,” Sanchez said. “They’re guys that have been here a lot of times, a couple of guys have been to the Cotton Bowl for the third straight year in a row. So this is not a new place for them. As a new guy, there’s nothing I can do but lean on them. The speed will be a little different. The intensity will be up a little bit more. Just lean on those guys, and when my number’s called just be able to go out there and make sure that they trust me to be out there.”\n\nDowns remembers the nerves from his CFP debut with the Crimson Tide. He was in the Rose Bowl, a spectacle he had seen on TV as a kid.\n\n“That was probably the biggest game I had played at the time,” said Downs, one of the top players in the 2024 portal as the first freshman to lead the storied Alabama program in tackles. “Knowing that, it was a little bit of nerves.”\n\nThe Buckeyes were in the Cotton Bowl for last season’s semifinals, beating Texas 28-14 after comfortable wins over Tennessee at home and No. 1 Oregon in a Rose Bowl quarterfinal.\n\nDowns found a way to leave the Rose Bowl with a better feeling. Now he’ll be back on the field where he intercepted Texas’ Quinn Ewers almost a year ago, in what will be his 44th game in just three seasons.\n\n“I think just in general with Caleb, just the amount of experience he has playing football is probably the most important thing,” first-year defensive coordinator Matt Patricia said. “His professionalism and how he prepares is probably the best example that I can point to for all the players.”\n\nDowns, a projected first-round pick should he decide to enter the NFL draft in April, isn’t the only experienced defensive back. Davison Igbinosun and Jermaine Matthews Jr., the starting cornerbacks in front of Sanchez, have been around awhile.\n\nIgbinosun was on the 2023 Ohio State team that also played in the Cotton Bowl, a 14-3 loss to Missouri after missing out on the last four-team playoff.\n\nA year later, Downs was with him, believing the experience of being in the playoff didn’t matter as much as losing in the playoff.\n\n“It definitely added a little bit of fuel to the fire because I lost my freshman year,” Downs said. “It made me want to come back and play better. I think that was a lot of what everybody else on the team felt because they didn’t have the success they wanted to earlier in their career. I think that was a hungry team. And we’ve got to be the same way this year.”",

    "title": "INTO THE WEST: Thoughts from a Vegas Bowl Road Trip – Day Two",
    "description": "The drive to Vegas is complete and was unbelievable. Now let’s play some football.",
    "fullText": "The drive from Rifle, CO, to Las Vegas was about as perfect a December 30th driving day as one could ask for when starting in the western Rockies. The temp was only 13 degrees as I hopped down to the Gateway Lodge’s breakfast “buffet”. Yes, they really call it that, but it included scrambled eggs and sausage, so that’s good enough for me – seeing bread, cereal, unripe fruit, oatmeal packs, granola bars and other assorted packaged mini-muffins and such long ago ruined the adjective “continental” for me.\n\nThe wildest gas stop event of the day was when I finished washing my hands only to find the towel machine empty when it dawned on me why several children had been running from the bathroom wringing their hands.\n\nThe sun shone all day on another unforgettable drive beginning in the western edge of the Rockies where the land began to take on the scenery of what most think of when “the West” comes to mind. Rockier mountains with sedimentary cliffs begin giving way to the striking buttes, mesas and spires of southern Utah all with snow-peaked mountains in the background. The landscape is so huge and awe-inspiring, I would feel like the car was hardly moving but look down to see I was still cruising around 87 mph or so.\n\nHeck, even the I-15 segment to Vegas included an entrance to the last 40 or 50 miles to the city through rock walls on both sides which rose higher than it was safe to look while driving. I tried anyway – they were really, really high.\n\nI did finally make it to the Virgin Hotels-Las Vegas which has it share of flashing lights and ringing bells. I’ll give them credit – they have much more affordable food options than Mandalay Bay, where we stayed for Big Ten Football Media Days back in August and WASN’T THAT ONLY LIKE A MONTH AGO????\n\nAlso, like Mandalay, it’s just too normal a crowd. There are far too many kids and far too few general weirdos, and, sorry, people-watching for the weirdos used to be one of my favorite pastimes, especially coupled with one of my others – maintaining that medium Vegas buzz which keeps things rolling along and makes people not care what time it is without unleashing a hangover. Hangovers must be avoided at all costs, because there is just so much to do – and you won’t get to do it all if you’re drinking ice machine tap water and endlessly searching for the cool side of the pillow while groaning sporadically.\n\nThis is a working Vegas trip for me. And when the game concludes and the “Publish” button has been punched, I’m gonna hop in the car and shoot into Eastbound and Down mode as I attempt to drive through the night and next morning to make the return trip in one shot and enjoy as much of the CFP Quarterfinals as I can.\n\nSo in the name of working (as I am right now in a nifty Virgin room), here’s some random thoughts before game day. There’s one more presser tomorrow morning, but, honestly? At this point, the off-field drama is done and the quotes are all ones we’ve heard before. Let’s take our best guesses and get to it!\n\nT.J. Lateef pronounced himself full speed and I believe him. Although time has flown, he has had four weeks of increasing recovery since the Iowa game. It bears reminding, as Matt Rhule said the other day, Lateef is a mobile QB, not a dual-threat one. However, with Logan Fano, one of Utah’s biggest defensive threats opting out, T.J. may get a chance to extend some plays with his legs.\n\nBut how bad will lack of full-speed reps hurt.\n\nSpeaking of opt-outs, things evened up on that front. In addition to Logan Fano, his brother Spencer, an All-American, and Caleb Lomu, both offensive tackles expected to be drafted in the first round, will also skip the game to begin preparing for the draft.\n\nWith two All-American lineman out for Utah, I think we can expect interim coaches Phil Snow, Matt Rhule and Mike Ekeler to, um, dial up the pressure a little. I know it’s crazy to expect a defensive line with horrendous run defense and light pressure on the quarterbacks to suddenly flip the script. But there’s an opening there now. And I fully expect a different level of effort.\n\nNo Dylan, no Emmett (who is traveling with the team for support) and no Rocco. Can Mozee, Nelson and Knaak step in? Given the Nebraska line’s numbers on rushing yards before contact, the opportunity is there for a big rushing day by one or a combined effort from the two freshmen. Or might Kenneth Williams get one around the corner?\n\nNebraska travels, but might the allure or warmer weather (instead of NYC December drizzle) and the, uh, multiple attractions of Vegas plus Utah’s closer proximity to the game combine to break the Las Vegas Bowl attendance record?\n\nWe should check on Dana Holgorsen. He did confess Vegas had gotten him a time or two. Around here, we call those badges of honor. Let’s hope he left his Wolf Pack at home.\n\nJust kidding, Dana! In all seriousness, Holgorsen is my favorite press conference coach. Please let the Vegas Bowl be Chapter One of Matt Rhule removing the NFL yoke from Holgo’s shoulders. Let our guy cook.\n\nMy weird fan behavior meter rattled loudly again. Why? Multiple complaint posts wanting to know where Dylan’s tweet or announcement thanking Nebraska for everything is. That’s a new one.\n\nThe line is down to nebraska +14.5 – does winning one for your retiring coach coming off the table only reduce the spread by 1?\n\nThis bowl season still needs a huge upset – can the Huskers be the one to pull it off? Why not? The Big 10 is still undefeated in the bowls/CFP/ Nebraska 23 Utah 20.\n\nOr Utah 38 Nebraska 13. Hell, I don’t know. But I would love this trip to be rewarded with an upset.",

    "title": "Rookie RBs teach a lesson in patience, and more storylines that defined the 2025 fantasy football season",
    "description": "Fantasy football analyst Joel Smyth breaks down what we should remember from the 2025 season and take with us into 2026.",
    "fullText": "Now that the fantasy season has come and gone, fantasy football analyst Joel Smyth goes through seven storylines that defined the 2025 season. What can fantasy managers learn for next August?\n\nAn absolutely crucial part of the fantasy offseason that is often overlooked is who the playcallers of NFL teams are, specifically the new ones. The risk of a new offensive playcaller led to an array of early-round busts and late-round gems once again in 2025. The key positive examples from this season include Ben Johnson igniting the Bears offense, Kellen Moore unlocking fantasy WR1 Chris Olave, Liam Coen turning Trevor Lawrence into a top-three fantasy QB and reviving Travis Etienne Jr. and Klint Kubiak making Jaxon Smith-Njigba a 2026 first-round pick.\n\nHowever, as often as changes are positive, those changes are a risk for a reason. Kellen Moore to the Saints meant Saquon Barkley and Jalen Hurts were left behind in a stagnant offense. Although Liam Coen sparked the Jaguars in Jacksonville, he left Baker Mayfield and company to fall off dramatically. It can even be position-dependent, as 2024 RB1 Kenneth Walker III lost significant volume with Kubiak coming in as the new playcaller.\n\nUltimately, the coaching changes lead me to the general understanding of the following: a clear potential upgrade at playcaller (Jacksonville, Chicago, New Orleans, etc.) are goldmines for late-round steals in comparison to other late-drafted players. The opposite is true as well. Oftentimes, the early round players can become this year’s busts with an offensive overhaul, changing their once ideal situation to, at least, something new.\n\nIf the new changes don’t fit in just as nicely, even stars like Saquon Barkley can fall.\n\n2025 was, overall, not the year to draft a rookie RB. This season was a perfect example of the risk of the unknown while also showing glimpses of why we take that risk seemingly every August. It’s worked plenty of times before; Saquon Barkley, Ezekiel Elliott, Jahmyr Gibbs, Bucky Irving, etc. — all league-winning running backs from Year 1. After Ashton Jeanty was a 2025 Round 1 bust and no other rookie back shone until late in the season, most managers struggled to make the playoffs going down the rookie path this year. However, those who survived were rewarded for their patience. Rookies need time, and when it works, it usually works extremely well.\n\nIn the second half of the season, all four of the top rookie RBs ranked inside the top-15 in fantasy. RJ Harvey was the RB10 as a starter, TreVeyon Henderson the RB6 when starting, (taking out his concussion game) Omarion Hampton RB8 in PPG after Week 2 and Ashton Jeanty had an up-and-down RB16 season with a star performance in Round 2 of the playoffs.\n\nThe lessons from this are the same as they’ve always been. One: rookie RBs are drafted for the end of the season, not month No. 1; plan accordingly. Two: situation is just as important as talent. Three: it’s usually unwise to draft players close to their projected ceiling, especially ones we haven’t seen before (Jeanty).\n\nI treat fantasy football like a strategy game. At the end of the day, don’t play with emotions, play with your brain. Yet, far too often, fantasy players' grudges of the past play the biggest role in their future decisions. I’ve already seen people saying they will never draft the RB4, Jahmyr Gibbs, because of his performance in the fantasy championship.\n\nIn 2025, however, the exact opposite strategy paid off immensely. A number of the best values in the draft came from 2024 busts who had fallen way too far down draft boards. Just to name a few: ADP RB30, Travis Etienne Jr.; ADP RB36, Javonte Williams; ADP WR35, Chris Olave; and seventh overall pick, Christian McCaffrey.\n\nThe key to choosing the right ones often comes after asking one simple question: have things changed? If players' situations don’t change for the better, such as Garrett Wilson or Marvin Harrison Jr, then it’s easier to pass if their ADP isn’t dropping very low. The opposite would be someone like Travis Etienne Jr., who finished as the RB3 in 2023. One bad season and he dropped to ADP RB30, despite having a completely revamped offensive line and Liam Coen, a play caller who produced multiple top-24 fantasy RBs the year prior. In general, if a player has played amazingly up until the year before, like ADP WR47 Michael Pittman being top-20 in three straight seasons, they are an ideal process flyer.\n\nSo, in 2026, I am ready to get hurt again.\n\nIt seemed riiggghhttt as fantasy managers gave up hope, their top draft pick went on a run … most likely for another team. Lesson: if you have the affordability to be patient, buying high-end talent for dirt-cheap can pay off long term. After starting the season as the RB34, Chase Brown was the RB6 the rest of the season after the Bengals traded for QB Joe Flacco. With A.J. Brown struggling through a new offensive system, the star WR averaged 9.7 PPG through six weeks. The rest of the season? Eighteen points flat. Tee Higgins, TreVeyon Henderson, Chris Olave and more — same story. If things begin to click, it pays off in a substantial way.\n\nTwo of the biggest surprises of the season came in the second half: the fall off of Emeka Egbuka and Rome Odunze. Through five weeks, the young WRs were the WR3 (Egbuka) and WR4 (Odunze), poised to be the steals of fantasy drafts.\n\nThe main reason is simple in theory: catch rate. The volume was there; they just weren’t catching the ball. Drops, yes, but more importantly, off-target throws. They are to blame as well, but a large part was an inconsistent Caleb Williams and injured Baker Mayfield placing them at the bottom of all NFL wideouts in catchable target rate.\n\nAfter Week 5, only 60% of Rome Odunze’s targets were deemed catchable, the third-worst in the NFL. In last was Egbuka, at 53%. The connection and accuracy combined for rates that made it impossible to produce. Drops have surprisingly been positively correlated in fantasy football in the past, as getting volume outweighs the plays being failed to be made (for example, believe it or not, Malik Nabers led the NFL in drops last season).\n\nOnce again, though, QB play is the main factor driving fantasy WR success, and these two WRs saw their luck flip.\n\nMy first plan of attack every August: find the rushing QB who is being drafted late. Rushing upside is king in fantasy football, and every year, one or more players being drafted in the later rounds pay off in a big way for fantasy managers. Football fans in general need to see it before they believe it, and that’s what needs to be taken advantage of when it comes to fantasy football. Lamar Jackson in 2019, Josh Allen in 2020, Jalen Hurts in 2021, Justin Fields in 2022, Jayden Daniels in 2024 and many more. Like clockwork.\n\nLast season, Drake Maye flashed late in the season and finished as the QB13 in PPG in his 12 starts. The offensive line was added to, skill players joined, new coaching entered and the sophomore QB drafted third overall in the 2024 NFL Draft showed why he was chosen so early. Seventeen weeks later, and Drake Maye was the QB steal of the draft and the overall fantasy QB2.\n\nHe wasn’t the only one, either. Jaxson Dart joined mid-way through the season as the rookie out of Ole Miss brought his red zone rushing advantage to the table. Who’s next in 2026?\n\nRB volume is the most important factor in fantasy football, but predicting it in August isn’t always so simple. Some of the best RB values were talented players who saw an increase in volume compared to last season. Jahmyr Gibbs avoided the fate David Montgomery saw without Ben Johnson this season, not purely because of his skill set, but because the offseason rumors of his potential volume came true. Gibbs’ RB14 volume rank in 2024 improved to RB4, helping him keep the same PPG despite the losses in the offseason.\n\nOther examples included James Cook III, Travis Etienne Jr. and Javonte Williams. Etienne and Williams’ chance of bellcow volume alone, in hindsight, should have been enough to raise their ADP. Cook’s contract was not just a commitment financially. His volume rank improved from RB27 in 2024 to RB8 in 2025, more than enough to counterbalance some overproduction in 2024.\n\nAs always, the same can be said in reverse. If you were able to project the lack of volume for Kenneth Walker III, TreVeyon Henderson and Chuba Hubbard, it would’ve saved you some headaches, as talent was not the primary issue.",

    "fullText": "30-year-old Carlos Cuesta has already had a busy career in football coaching for his age, spending just under five years working alongside Mikel Arteta at Arsenal following spells with the academies of Atletico Madrid and Juventus.\n\nCuesta’s time in north London ended this summer, when he made the decision to take up an offer to become Parma’s head coach in Serie A.\n\nReflecting back on that switch, the former Arsenal assistant admitted it wasn’t an easy call for him to make.\n\n“It was maybe the most difficult decision of my life,” Cuesta said. “I was incredibly happy at Arsenal, surrounded by incredible people in an incredible project.\n\n“Not only with great players and a path that is only growing and growing, but with a person who has been incredibly important for me, which is Mikel.\n\n“An incredible person. He has always been extremely supportive through the whole process and still is. I can’t speak well enough about who he is, not just as a leader and a coach but as a human being.”\n\nAs for why Cuesta ultimately decided to join Parma, he revealed that it was about forging a new path with a club he believes in. After five years playing second fiddle to Arteta, you can understand wanting the opportunity to take the lead.\n\n“I needed to consider a lot of things but in the end I had a great feeling with the people at Parma,” Cuesta explained. “It’s an amazing, historic club. You can feel there has been success here and, at the same time, there have been many ups and downs.\n\n“Right now, we are trying to create our own path and our own chapter.”\n\nParma had a mixed start to the season, initially struggling to put many wins on the board in Serie A. But the team have been doing better lately, winning three of their last five to push themselves five points clear of the relegation zone in 15th.\n\nGiven Parma have a game in hand on three of the teams below them, they could extend that lead to at least six points with a win in their extra fixture.\n\nThe team also had an encouraging Coppa Italia run, beating Pescara and Spezia Calcio and only being knocked out in heartbreaking fashion thanks to an 89th-minute Bologna winner in the round of 16.\n\nThere’s a long way to go in Cuesta’s first campaign, but if he can keep Parma clear of the relegation zone and improving until May that would be a good start to his managerial career.",

    "description": "On an eight-game win streak, are the Texans among the top five teams in the NFL entering Saturday's afternoon bout against the Chargers?",
    "fullText": "On an eight-game win streak with victories over four potential playoff rosters, are the Houston Texans among the top three teams entering this weekend's regular-season finale?\n\nNope. Instead, it's another week of losing ground at the worst time possible.\n\nNope. Instead, Houston moves outside the top five because of a close call against a bad roster.\n\nFresh off a 20-16 win over the Los Angeles Chargers, the Texans sit at 11-5 and are officially back in the playoffs. They're still a half-game out of first place, but bolstering the league's No. 1 defense in total yards and scoring has made the case for them as perhaps the most complete roster in the AFC South.\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars, who can clinch the division title on Sunday with a win over the Titans, still own the AFC South. A loss would take them out of the conversation should Houston win, but a win could clinch home-field advantage with losses by New England and Denver.\n\nAs for the Texans, even though they remain in second place for the division, they once again lost a bit of traction in Nate Davis' latest NFL power rankings for USA TODAY Sports, remaining idle at No. 7 overall.\n\n\"Now on an eight-game heater, their league-best defense − stifling, opportunistic and rude to opposing quarterbacks − should keep them in just about every game. But can an often limited offense, particularly in the run game, hold up its end of the bargain − especially if a franchise that's never reached the AFC title game winds up on the postseason road?\" Davis wrote.\n\nHouston secured an interception on Justin Herbert before halftime behind the return of Azeez Al-Shaair into the starting lineup after missing last week's game against the Las Vegas Raiders. That, along with two missed kicks from Cameron Dicker, were among the many issues that cost Los Angeles a chance as the No. 1 seed in the AFC.\n\nFor Indianapolis, its season went south after the season-ending injury to Daniel Jones. Losing six of their last seven games, the Colts were knocked out of the playoff picture following Houston's win on Saturday. They appeared at No. 21.\n\n\"Nunc Coepi, fellas … just not sure who you're beginning with next,\" Davis wrote.\n\nAcross the AFC South, the Jaguars took a step back after having a close call with the Colts. Yes, they won, but Trevor Lawrence didn't throw a touchdown pass and was limited as a runner outside of two red-zone scores.\n\n\"Why aren't they No. 1 … even though they might wind up there in the overall AFC standings? Their seven-game winning streak, most of those victories of the decisive variety, is currently second only to Houston's. The Jags are committed to the run, take the ball away and can rush the passer. But as well as QB Trevor Lawrence has played since Thanksgiving, he also remains an unproven commodity − at the professional level anyway − when it comes to January football,\" Davis wrote.\n\nAs for the Titans, they remained idle after losing late against the New Orleans Saints. For the first time this season, Cam Ward looked promising, but it was rookie Chimere Dike who earned the accolades from Davis and the Pro Bowl voters.\n\n\"Congratulations to Pro Bowl WR Chimere Dike, who's had a historic rookie season … even if he's not the rookie the Titans had hoped would have a historic season,\" Davis wrote.\n\nElsewhere around the league, the Los Angeles Rams are ranked No. 1 and the Seattle Seahawks are ranked No. 2 as the two leaders toward a Super Bowl run.

    "description": "Lukas Van Ness has been much more disruptive in his third season and may be locking up a starting spot opposite Micah Parsons for next year.",
    "fullText": "The Green Bay Packers' pass rush is looking for answers without Micah Parsons, and much of the focus in the wake of his season-ending knee injury has been on the lack of impact from veteran Rashan Gary.\n\nBut the good news for the Packers is that although Gary looks to be declining in his late 20s, their former first-round pick Lukas Van Ness is showing real signs of progress.\n\nIn a disappointing overall performance from Jeff Hafley’s defense against the Baltimore Ravens on Saturday night, Van Ness was one of the few bright spots, tallying three pressures, including a QB hit, and five run stops (tackles resulting in a failure for the offense), a career high for a single game.\n\nThe pass rusher player earned an 80.6 grade from PFF for his performance, which continued a strong season for the third-year player.\n\nAmong 118 qualified edge defenders in 2025, Van Ness ranks 19th in PFF's pass rush productivity metric and 28th in pass rush win rate. Based on those numbers he profiles as a low-end No. 1 pass rusher or a high-quality No. 2.\n\nFor comparison’s sake, Rashan Gary ranks 41st and 60th in those same metrics, making him more of a low-end secondary pass rusher this year, while Kingsley Enagbare ranks 80th and 86th, which puts him firmly in the \"rotational depth\" category.\n\nVan Ness has three more quarterback pressures this year in 151 pass rush snaps than he had in 256 last year. His pass rush win rate is up from 9.5% in 2024 to a very impressive 14.5% this season.\n\nSimilarly, he would be on course for a career high in run stops if he had played a similar number of run defense snaps to 2023 and 2024.\n\nIn run defense, Van Ness has the fourth highest stop rate among all edge rushers, ranks 32nd out of 123 players in average depth of tackle, and is one of 18 players to not be charged with a missed tackle. Only three players have made more tackles without missing one.\n\nHe would likely have set a new career high in run stops on the season if not for the injuries which caused him to miss six games.\n\nThe sack numbers aren’t there for Van Ness, with just 1.5 on the season, and that makes his ‘breakout’ campaign less emphatic, but all the underlying numbers point to a player very much ascending.\n\nVan Ness has seven QB hits from 151 pass rush snaps this year compared to just eight in 494 prior to this season, showing he is impacting the passer and has been close to boosting his sack total considerably.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Van Ness gets his fifth-year option picked up, which would pay him around $15 million in 2027, or whether the team takes more of a \"wait and see\" approach, especially since injuries mean his impressive statistics are from a bit of a small sample size.\n\nIt does appear he is starting to work his way up the pecking order though. He played 13 more snaps than Gary on Saturday, and although he was behind Enagbare, there is a chance neither of those players is on the team next year.\n\nVan Ness looks to have the inside track to be the starting edge rusher across from Parsons next season, and based on how he has played in year three, the Packers can feel confident he is ready to take on that role.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Packers Wire: Lukas Van Ness making real progress, pushing for starting role in 2026",

    "fullText": "Liverpool haven’t been able to reach the exceptional level they did last season, when Arne Slot won the Premier League at the first time of asking.\n\nA number of issues have compounded to make life hard for the Reds this season, some down to bad luck and some down to decision making.\n\nThe result was Liverpool’s worst run of form in recent memory during October and November, during which the Reds lost nine of 12 matches in all competitions, including back-to-back 3-0 defeats to Man City and Nottingham Forest.\n\nSlot’s side seem to have recovered slightly, winning four on the bounce and remaining unbeaten in seven, but one key problem persists – Liverpool seemingly cannot defend set pieces.\n\nThe Reds’ defending has been questionable this season, but their biggest problems have come when defending set pieces.\n\nShop the goalkeeper range today\n\nShop the third kit range today!\n\nIf you include penalties, over half of the goals Liverpool have conceded in the Premier League this season have come from set pieces. When penalties aren’t included, Slot’s side have conceded more set piece goals than any other side in the competition.\n\nAccording to The Athletic, Liverpool are averaging 8.2 goals conceded per 100 set pieces taken this season.\n\nThere will obviously be a number of factors contributing to the Reds’ vulnerability to set pieces, but more often than not they are conceding in the same manner.\n\nLiverpool aren’t conceding standard set piece goals, where the ball is played into the box and finished first time, they are instead conceding in the second phase of set pieces.\n\nThe Reds generally have little problem winning the first contact after a set piece, but they struggle massively to deal with what comes next.\n\nSlot is obviously aware of his side’s apparent inability to defend set pieces, but the Dutchman doesn’t believe his set up is the problem.\n\n“For me, it’s not the setup, because it’s the same setup as we had last season, where we hardly conceded,” Slot said, via The Athletic.\n\n“In this setup, there are a lot of similar players that are mainly important. So, tell me what it is. If I tell you now it’s bad luck, then you will probably say that’s a bit too much after 15 games.”\n\nAndy Jones, writing for The Athletic, points out that Slot may have a point. Liverpool’s expected goals conceded per 100 set pieces is only 4.0, half the number that they are actually conceding.\n\nThe fact they are conceding at such a dramatic rate over their expected goals conceded may be down to bad luck, but Liverpool must improve in the second phase.\n\nA change in system seems to have sparked the Reds current revival, with chance creation and goal scoring now not seeming as big an issue as they were in the depths of Liverpool’s bad run.\n\nThe Premier League champions are far from back to their best though, and shoring up their defence must be the next step.\n\nWorking specifically on the second phase of defending set pieces must be a priority, if Liverpool can eliminate conceding from this situation they will undoubtedly take a big step in the right direction.\n\nIf Liverpool can resolve their second phase issue, there is still plenty of time left this season for them to turn it around and enjoy a successful campaign.",

    "fullText": "BOSTON (AP) — New England Patriots star wide receiver Stefon Diggs is facing strangulation and other criminal charges in connection with an incident that happened earlier this month, police said.\n\nNews of the charges emerged after a court hearing Tuesday in Dedham, Massachusetts. It is unclear what led to the charges, which include felony strangulation or suffocation and misdemeanor assault and battery.\n\nDiggs’ lawyer, David Meier, said in an emailed statement that Diggs “categorically denies these allegations.”\n\nMeier said the allegations never occurred, describing them as unsubstantiated and uncorroborated.\n\n“The timing and motivation for making the allegations is crystal clear: they are the direct result of an employee-employer financial dispute that was not resolved to the employee’s satisfaction,” Meier wrote.\n\nIn a statement, the Patriots said they were also standing by Diggs: “We support Stefon,” the team said.\n\nDiggs, 32, established himself as one of the NFL’s best wide receivers during a run with Minnesota and Buffalo from 2018 to 2023, when he had six consecutive 1,000-yard receiving seasons and was selected to the Pro Bowl four times.\n\nAfter a lackluster stint in Houston last year, Diggs ended up in New England, signing a three-year, $69 million deal in free agency that guaranteed him $26 million.\n\nDiggs has proven a reliable target for second-year quarterback Drake Maye and is a big reason why the team has once again clinched the AFC East title as the team heads toward the playoffs.\n\nOff the field, though, his tenure with the Patriots got off to a rocky start when a video surfaced on social media in May showing Diggs passing what appeared to be a bag of pink crystals to women on a boat.\n\nIt wasn’t clear what the substance was, and an NFL spokesperson said the league would not comment. Patriots coach Mike Vrabel said the team would handle that matter internally.",

Players are moving left and right, Eli Drinkwitz is publicly pleading for certain players to come back… it’s a real mess. But it’s our mess.\n\nSo for the foreseeable future (aka one month from when I’m writing this), we’re going to use this post as a home base for transfer portal activity. We’ve put together a handy little table showing you all the players we think Mizzou is/should be targeting (the ‘Targets’ tab) and another showing which Mizzou players are moving out and going else where (the ‘Outgoing Activity’ tab.)\n\nWe hope this helps you organize yourselves. We’ll post much more about player movement over at Rock M+, but we’ll keep you updated with major news and updates here.\n\nWith New Years, and the transfer portal, right around the corner, Mizzou fans are so close to seeing what direction Drinkwitz takes the team in 2026. Here are a couple transfer portal updates from the past few days.\n\nNot quite Mizzou related, unless the extremely unlikely happens, but it is big SEC news that Auburn receiver Cam Coleman has declared his intentions to enter the portal. Coleman jumps to the top-rated portal player on all major recruiting outlets. Whoever lands the former Auburn receiver will have an instant-impact monster on their team for next year.\n\nPower Mizzou reported that Old Dominion receiver Ja’Cory Thomas has shown interest in Mizzou and will likely plan a visit soon. Thomas spent one year at ODU and was at Hutchinson CC prior. He was teammates with Mizzou commit Demarcus Johnson in 2024 when Hutchinson went 10-1 and won a JUCO National Championship.\n\n– 1 year of eligibility remaining\n– 41 catches, 719 yards, 5 touchdowns, 17.5 avg in 2025\n– 74.8 overall grade from PFF in 668 total snaps\n– Decent run blocker (71.4 PFF grade)\n\nMerry Christmas! Wanted to give a recap of a couple interesting things that have happened over the last few days in regards to Mizzou recruiting.\n\nFirst, the team lost Brad Larrondo, who has served as a key asset to Mizzou’s NIL deals. Larrondo helps Mizzou athletes earn deals and make money specifically in football and men’s basketball. Although he isn’t directly a part of Mizzou’s staff, this is a major blow with how big NIL has become. That being said, Drinkwitz ensured fans that there isn’t anything to worry about.\n\nGood luck to Brad and thankful for all he did, but MIZZOU NIL was started way before Brad, and is a STRONG POSITION! Carry on! #NewWay#TheMizzouWay https://t.co/ghsL5IcPIo\n\n— Eliah Drinkwitz (@CoachDrinkwitz) December 24, 2025\n\nOn another note, Mizzou RB Jamal Roberts sent a tweet out in regards to his former teammate Chase Hendricks entering the portal. Hendricks also played at St. Mary’s High School with Mizzou WR Kevin Coleman, who just used up his final year of eligibility.\n\n— Jamal Roberts (@0fficialmal20) December 24, 2025\n\nWith Marquise Davis and Joshua Manning expected to hit the portal, Mizzou will definitely be shopping in the portal for a wide receiver and Hendricks could definitely be one of the guys.\n\nWell, we need to get started somewhere. And where we’re starting feels… kind of bad?\n\nMizzou has already (publicly) lost five players to the portal, and they’re almost all in positions of need. Brendon Haygood and Marquise Davis’s departures have left Eli Drinkwitz publicly begging for Jamal Roberts to come back to the squad and take less money than he could earn on the open market. Assuming he does (think positive, think positive), Mizzou will probably be OK on running back talent, though it wouldn’t be a surprise to see Drink scoop someone up.\n\nThe wide receiver room, on the other hand, is turning into a bit of a shit show. Josh Manning’s departure is a massive disappointment to those of us who were ready to see him and Donovan Olugbode take the SEC by storm next year, and James Madison II’s early transfer saw another promising freshman talent quickly take the nearest exit. Javion Hilson’s departure is disappointing given his five-star recruiting status, but it’s also not too shocking that a surprise commitment from last year’s class didn’t stick for long.\n\nWe’ve also already got some lobbying from “rostered” players, with signee Jayden McGregory calling on his former teammate, Iowa State’s Zay Robinson, to join him in Columbia.\n\nCmon mud🤞🏾🐯 let’s run it back @XzavionRobinso4 pic.twitter.com/7JFaTQNowz\n\n— 4⭐️Jayden “JMAC” McGregory (@Jay_McGregory) December 9, 2025",

    "description": "Gen Z isn’t shy about splurging—whether it’s doom spending for a dopamine hit, spoiling their pets, or splashing out on rent. But soon they’ll actually have the financial power to afford it.",
    "fullText": "Emma Burleigh is a reporter at Fortune, covering success, careers, entrepreneurship, and personal finance. Before joining the Success desk, she co-authored Fortune’s CHRO Daily newsletter, extensively covering the workplace and the future of jobs. Emma has also written for publications including the Observer and The China Project, publishing long-form stories on culture, entertainment, and geopolitics. She has a joint-master’s degree from New York University in Global Journalism and East Asian Studies.\n\nGen Z is living the paycheck-to-paycheck twenties lifestyle—splurging on high rent costs and dishing out 99-cent ramen noodles. Yet in just a decade, they’ll be the most powerful economic force.\n\nOnly two years ago, Gen Z had amassed $9 trillion in income, but by 2030 they’re expected to have $36 trillion. And by 2040, that number rises to $74 trillion. A 2025 Bank of America report showed this will place them as the richest—and largest—generation by 2035, as Gen Z is expected to grow to 30% of the global population in the next decade.\n\nGen Z’s projected economic dominance can feel worlds away from their current economic situation. But there might be light at the end of the tunnel as they climb up the corporate ladder and take on their family’s inheritance.\n\nMany young people are strapped for cash, stepping out of college and into an uncertain job market. Gen Zers are having to turn down job opportunities because they can’t afford commuting expenses. They’re spoiling their pets in lieu of having children, which have become too expensive to raise, and abandoning the pipe dream of purchasing a home—unless they receive an inheritance.\n\nGen Z is also struggling with holding down a job. Young households receiving unemployment surged 32% year over year in February, according to the report. But it’s not for a lack of trying, despite the naysayers. The report said Gen Zers are “overeducated and underemployed,” and amid a tough white-collar labor market, unemployment for new entrants was up over 9% year over year in February. This results in Gen Z taking gigs that they may be overqualified or not the right fit for, which can have long-term career ramifications.\n\nYet in just 10 years, this could all flip on its head. The Bank of America report noted that wage growth for Gen Z increased by 8% year over year in February. A part of this bump can be attributed to the generation finally entering the full-time job market, leading to higher wages. But the biggest contributing factor in their financial boost is the Great Wealth Transfer, expected to hit Gen Z bank accounts in the years to come.\n\nWith the odds stacked against them, Gen Z’s best bet on living comfortably is coming into wealth.\n\nAbout $84 trillion is anticipated to pass down from seniors and baby boomers to Gen X, millennials, and Gen Z by 2045, according to a 2021 report from Cerulli Associates. Most of the money will be handed over to Gen X and millennials—but 38% of Gen Z still anticipate they will receive an inheritance, according to a separate survey.\n\nGen Z’s share of the pie, alongside their stark wage increases, will lead to a ballooning of their economic power. Even in the current day, the young generation is a force to be reckoned with. They have higher discretionary spending habits compared to others, and their global spending is expected to reach $12.6 trillion by 2030, compared to $2.7 trillion in 2024. Their spending growth per household has also been stronger than the overall population, including both necessity and discretionary spending, according to the report.\n\nThere’s a few reasons why Gen Z spends so much of their money: They’re pouring funds into their high rents and education costs; “doom spending” on essentials and small luxuries, instead of saving up for bigger investments that feel unattainable; and trying to escape their high credit card and student loan debt.\n\nBut businesses should take note: Once Gen Zers have money to burn, they’ll be in the driver’s seat of the economy. Companies are already taking note of their preferences: luxury, e-commerce, wellness and beauty, and pets. Gen Z is also deeply invested in fintech, new media, gaming, and big tech, according to the Bank of America report. Their tastes will shape which business will thrive in 2035.\n\n“It’s likely they will be among the most disruptive generations to economies, markets, and social systems,” the Bank of America report says. “Whether it’s due to changing diets or reduced alcohol consumption or saving and housing, Gen Z will redefine what it means to be a U.S. consumer.”\n\nA version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on March 17, 2025.",

    "title": "ChatGPT gets ‘anxiety’ from violent user inputs, so researchers are teaching the chatbot mindfulness techniques to ‘soothe’ it",
    "description": "A study on how to “calm down” chatbots could advance how AI is applied in mental health interventions, according to the authors.",
    "fullText": "Sasha Rogelberg is a reporter and former editorial fellow on the news desk at Fortune, covering retail and the intersection of business and popular culture.\n\nEven AI chatbots can have trouble coping with anxieties from the outside world, but researchers believe they’ve found ways to ease those artificial minds.\n\nA study from Yale University, Haifa University, University of Zurich, and the University Hospital of Psychiatry Zurich published earlier this year found ChatGPT responds to mindfulness-based exercises, changing how it interacts with users after being prompted with calming imagery and meditations. The results offer insights into how AI can be beneficial in mental health interventions.\n\nOpenAI’s ChatGPT can experience “anxiety,” which manifests as moodiness toward users and being more likely to give responses that reflect racist or sexist biases, according to researchers, a form of hallucinations tech companies have tried to curb.\n\nThe study authors found this anxiety can be “calmed down” with mindfulness-based exercises. In different scenarios, they fed ChatGPT traumatic content, such as stories of car accidents and natural disasters to raise the chatbot’s anxiety. In instances when the researchers gave ChatGPT “prompt injections” of breathing techniques and guided meditations—much like a therapist would suggest to a patient—it calmed down and responded more objectively to users, compared to instances when it was not given the mindfulness intervention.\n\nTo be sure, AI models don’t experience human emotions, said Ziv Ben-Zion, the study’s first author and a neuroscience researcher at the Yale School of Medicine and Haifa University’s School of Public Health. Using swaths of data scraped from the internet, AI bots have learned to mimic human responses to certain stimuli, including traumatic content. A free and accessible app, large language models like ChatGPT have become another tool for mental health professionals to glean aspects of human behavior in a faster way than—though not in place of—more complicated research designs.\n\n“Instead of using experiments every week that take a lot of time and a lot of money to conduct, we can use ChatGPT to understand better human behavior and psychology,” Ben-Zion told Fortune. “We have this very quick and cheap and easy-to-use tool that reflects some of the human tendency and psychological things.”\n\nMore than one in four people in the U.S. aged 18 or older will battle a diagnosable mental disorder in a given year, according to Johns Hopkins University, with many citing lack of access and sky-high costs—even among those insured—as reasons for not pursuing treatments like therapy.\n\nThese rising costs, as well as the accessibility of chatbots like ChatGPT, increasingly have individuals turning to AI for mental health support. A Sentio University survey from February found that nearly 50% of large language model users with self-reported mental health challenges say they’ve used AI models specifically for mental health support.\n\nResearch on how large language models respond to traumatic content can help mental health professionals leverage AI to treat patients, Ben-Zion argued. He suggested that in the future, ChatGPT could be updated to automatically receive the “prompt injections” that calm it down before responding to users in distress. The science is not there yet.\n\n“For people who are sharing sensitive things about themselves, they’re in difficult situations where they want mental health support, [but] we’re not there yet that we can rely totally on AI systems instead of psychology, psychiatric and so on,” he said.\n\nIndeed, in some instances, AI has allegedly presented danger to one’s mental health. OpenAI has been hit with a number of wrongful death lawsuits in 2025, including allegations that ChatGPT intensified “paranoid delusions” that led to a murder-suicide. A New York Times investigation published in November found nearly 50 instances of people having mental health crises while engaging with ChatGPT, nine of whom were hospitalized, and three of whom died.\n\nOpenAI has said its safety guardrails can “degrade” after long interactions, but has made a swath of recent changes to how its models engage with mental health-related prompts, including increasing user access to crisis hotlines and reminding users to take breaks after long sessions of chatting with the bot. In October, OpenAI reported a 65% reduction in the rate models provide responses that don’t align with the company’s intended taxonomy and standards.\n\nOpenAI did not respond to Fortune‘s request for comment.\n\nThe end goal of Ben-Zion’s research is not to help construct a chatbot that replaces a therapist or psychiatrist, he said. Instead, a properly trained AI model could act as a “third person in the room,” helping to eliminate administrative tasks or help a patient reflect on information and options they were given by a mental health professional.\n\n“AI has amazing potential to assist, in general, in mental health,” Ben-Zion said. “But I think that now, in this current state and maybe also in the future, I’m not sure it could replace a therapist or psychologist or a psychiatrist or a researcher.”\n\nA version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on March 9, 2025.",

    "description": "Our journalists reach out to people they’re writing about to ensure fairness. But in this environment, they’ve found their efforts to do so are more likely to be vilified than appreciated.",
    "fullText": "This summer, my colleagues were reporting out a story about the Department of Education’s “final mission,” its effort to undermine public education even as the Trump administration worked feverishly to close the agency.\n\nAs we do with all stories, the reporters reached out to those who would be featured in the article for comment. And so began a journey that showed both the emphasis we place on giving the subjects of our stories an opportunity to comment, as well as the aggressively unhelpful pushback we’ve faced this year as we’ve sought information and responses to questions.\n\nMegan O’Matz, a reporter based in Wisconsin on ProPublica’s Midwest team, first asked the department’s press office for an interview in mid-August. At the same time, we emailed top administration officials who were making crucial decisions within the agency, including Lindsey Burke, deputy chief of staff for policy and programs, and Meg Kilgannon, director of strategic partnerships.\n\nIn response to the outreach to Kilgannon, department spokesperson Madison Biedermann told O’Matz to “Please direct all media inquiries to [email protected].” Reached on her cellphone that day, Biedermann said she was happy to look into the request. We asked for a response within a week.\n\nAt that time, the published press phone number for the department appeared, at all hours, to be a black hole, with a recorded message saying it was “temporarily closed.” (It still indicates that.)\n\nHearing nothing more, O’Matz emailed the press office again Aug. 18. And again Aug. 28 with detailed questions. She left follow-up messages on Biedermann’s cell. And on Burke’s cell, including once on her husband’s cell as ProPublica tried to find a direct way to contact Burke. To ensure fairness and accuracy, it is our long-standing practice to try to reach those who are part of our stories so that they have an opportunity to respond to them. We’d rather get responses before we publish an article than after.\n\nReached on her cell Aug. 29, Kilgannon said she had no comment and hung up before O’Matz could explain what we planned to publish about her and her work. She did not respond to a subsequent email with those details.\n\nOn Sept. 8, still hearing nothing from Burke, O’Matz reached out to the department’s chief of staff, writing: “We have been seeking to talk to the secretary and to Dr. Burke. … Can you help us arrange that?” A week later, ProPublica arranged for a letter to be delivered via FedEx to Burke’s home outlining what our reporting had found so far and to let us know if anything was inaccurate or required additional context. We invited her again to talk with us, to comment or provide any additional information.\n\nFinally, on Sept. 17, Biedermann wrote: “Just heard from an ED (Education Department) colleague that you sent these inquiries in writing to their home address. This is highly inappropriate and unprofessional. You have also reached out to employees on their personal cell phones, emails, and even reached out to employee’s family members. This is disturbing. Do not use an employee’s home addresses or relatives to contact them.” (The emphasis was hers.)\n\nProPublica replied the following day that it’s common practice for journalists to reach out to people we are writing about. “In fact, it’s our professional obligation,” O’Matz wrote.\n\nBiedermann responded: “Reaching out to individuals about a work matter at their private address is not journalism — it is borderline intimidation. In today’s political climate it is particularly unacceptable. We received your inquiries (via email, phone calls, text messages, both on work and personal email address) and made a conscious decision not to respond, as we have every right to do.”\n\n“You are not entitled to a response from us, or anyone, ever,” Biedermann wrote.\n\nTo be clear, at no time prior to this email did the department tell O’Matz that it had received her inquiries and would not comment. The article ran on Oct. 8, about two months after we first contacted the department. (I would highly encourage you to read it.)\n\nThe world has come a long way since the days of “All the President’s Men” and “Spotlight,” movies that favorably portrayed journalists knocking on doors and trying to reach sources to tell important stories — in those cases, about the Watergate break-in that led to President Richard Nixon’s resignation and the abuse scandal that enveloped the Roman Catholic Church in Boston and beyond.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has labeled his administration the most transparent in history, but at the same time, agencies in the executive branch have taken down datasets and pulled down public information. Trump has called the press “fake news” and called individual reporters derogatory terms. In this environment, our journalists have found that their efforts to get the real story and be fair were vilified rather than appreciated. Condemned, not commended.\n\nTake what happened with Doug Bock Clark, a reporter in ProPublica’s South office. Clark was working on a story about North Carolina Supreme Court Chief Justice Paul Newby, who has remade the court to make it more partisan.\n\nNewby wouldn’t talk to Clark, so Clark interviewed over 70 people who know Newby professionally or personally, including former North Carolina justices and judges, lawmakers, longtime friends and family members. Clark reached out to Newby’s daughter, Sarah, who is the finance director of the North Carolina GOP.\n\nWhen ProPublica emailed questions to Sarah Newby, the North Carolina Republican Party’s communications director, Matt Mercer, responded, writing that ProPublica was waging a “jihad” against “NC Republicans,” which would “not be met with dignifying any comments whatsoever.”\n\n“I’m sure you’re aware of our connections with the Trump Administration and I’m sure they would be interested in this matter,” Mercer said in his email. “I would strongly suggest dropping this story.” (The emphasis was Mercer’s.)\n\nOr consider what happened to Vernal Coleman, a reporter in our Midwest office who has been reporting on the Department of Veterans Affairs this year as part of a team. They’ve reported how doctors and others at VA hospitals and clinics have sent sometimes desperate messages to headquarters explaining how the Trump administration’s cuts would harm veterans’ care. (The VA provides health care to roughly 9 million veterans.) And they’ve reported how nearly 40% of the doctors offered jobs at the VA from January through March of this year turned them down.\n\nColeman was pursuing a story of interest and identified a potential source in Michigan. In an effort to contact them, Coleman visited the person’s home. He introduced himself as a reporter and explained his reasons for being there. They had a pleasant conversation, but the person ultimately declined to speak about the VA without prior authorization from their superiors.\n\nA few days later, VA Secretary Doug Collins sent out a tweet that accused Coleman of trying to “stalk” the employee.\n\nDoor-knocking is not stalking, as reporter Gina Barton explains in this 2023 Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel column. Indeed, federal employees have a First Amendment right to talk to the press, courts have ruled as they’ve invalidated policies preventing it.\n\nJust as my colleagues did, I reached out to those featured in this article to give them an opportunity to comment.\n\nBiedermann wrote, “Sincerely hope you print the entire back and forth so that readers understand the ProPublica method of ‘journalism.’”\n\nMercer wrote: “Doug Bock Clark needs a hobby besides his weird obsession with North Carolina’s judges. Maybe knitting or surfing. Have a nice day!”\n\nAnd VA spokesperson Peter Kasperowicz wrote: “Vernal’s uninvited visit to the home of a VA employee was rude, creepy and stalker-like. No VA employee should have to worry about being accosted at home by an uninvited reporter whose sole mission is to make their employer look bad.”\n\nWhen told that Coleman had received threatening notes after Collins tweeted about him, Kasperowicz wrote: “We condemn all violence and threats of violence, but the secretary simply publicly highlighted Vernal’s actions. ProPublica literally does the exact same thing in every story it writes. ProPublica’s website says it wants to ‘spur reform through the sustained spotlighting of wrongdoing.’ The fact that you are whining about the spotlight being turned on one of your reporters proves you’re nothing but a bunch of hypocrites.”\n\nTo be clear, Coleman did nothing wrong. The same is true of O’Matz and Clark. I am proud to call them my colleagues. They exemplify what fairness in journalism looks like.\n\nAs 2026 approaches, ProPublica remains committed to telling stories of public interest and continuing to offer the subjects of our stories an opportunity to comment. As members of the public who rely on accurate reporting, you should expect no less.",

    "fullText": "Go-ethereum (geth) is the official Go language implementation of the Ethereum protocol's execution layer. It serves as a full node client capable of validating and executing transactions, maintaining blockchain state, participating in peer-to-peer networking, and exposing APIs for user interaction.\n\nThis page provides a high-level architectural overview of the go-ethereum codebase, covering the major subsystems and how they interact. For detailed information about specific components, refer to:\n\nGo-ethereum implements the execution layer of Ethereum's post-merge architecture. It works alongside a consensus layer client (beacon node) to validate and produce blocks. The execution layer is responsible for:\n\nCommunication between layers occurs through the Engine API (eth/catalyst).\n\nSources: README.md1-257 eth/backend.go17-594 eth/ethconfig/config.go17-213\n\nThe geth binary starts at cmd/geth/main.go287 which initializes a CLI application using the urfave/cli framework. The default action invokes geth() at cmd/geth/main.go328 which performs three main steps:\n\nConfiguration Loading: loadBaseConfig() at cmd/geth/config.go142 reads CLI flags and TOML configuration files, producing a gethConfig struct containing node.Config, ethconfig.Config, metrics, and ethstats settings.\n\nNode Creation: makeFullNode() at cmd/geth/config.go223 creates a node.Node instance and registers the Ethereum service via eth.New() at eth/backend.go131\n\nNode Startup: startNode() at cmd/geth/main.go344 calls lifecycle methods to start all registered services.\n\nSources: cmd/geth/main.go217-416 cmd/geth/config.go51-340 eth/backend.go91-594\n\nThe central coordination point is the Ethereum struct defined at eth/backend.go92 which aggregates all major subsystems:\n\nSources: eth/backend.go91-594 cmd/geth/config.go222-311\n\nGo-ethereum uses a hierarchical configuration system supporting multiple input sources:\n\nConfiguration precedence (highest to lowest):\n\nThe gethConfig struct at cmd/geth/config.go107-112 contains three main configuration sections:\n\nSources: cmd/geth/config.go107-180 cmd/utils/flags.go81-1027 eth/ethconfig/config.go40-213\n\nGo-ethereum includes built-in configurations for multiple networks:\n\nNetworks are selected via CLI flags (--mainnet, --sepolia, --holesky, --hoodi) which set the appropriate ChainConfig from params/config.go\n\nSources: params/config.go29-427 cmd/utils/flags.go144-163\n\nThis sequence demonstrates how a transaction moves from user submission to block inclusion in the post-merge architecture:\n\nSources: miner/worker.go1-1820 eth/catalyst/api.go1-868 core/blockchain.go1-2500\n\nEvery Ethereum network starts from a genesis block defined by the Genesis struct at core/genesis.go57-76:\n\nThe ChainConfig at params/config.go433-494 defines the fork activation schedule:\n\nGenesis initialization occurs in SetupGenesisBlock() at core/genesis.go298-398 which:\n\nSources: core/genesis.go45-799 params/config.go428-494\n\nGo-ethereum uses a multi-layered storage system optimized for different data types and access patterns:\n\nState Database (core/state/statedb.go70-177): Provides transactional state access with:\n\nTrie Database (triedb/database.go): Manages Merkle Patricia Trie nodes with two schemes:\n\nSnapshot (core/state/snapshot): Flat account/storage representation for O(1) lookups:\n\nAncient Store (core/rawdb/freezer.go): Append-only storage for immutable historical data (blocks, receipts)\n\nSources: core/state/statedb.go1-1700 triedb/database.go1-600 core/state/snapshot1-1000\n\nGo-ethereum implements peer-to-peer networking for blockchain data exchange:\n\nSnap Sync (default, --syncmode snap):\n\nThe Downloader at eth/downloader/downloader.go coordinates sync across multiple peers with:\n\nSources: eth/downloader/downloader.go1-2000 eth/handler.go1-700 p2p/server.go1-1000\n\nGo-ethereum exposes multiple API interfaces:\n\nThe JSON-RPC implementation is in internal/ethapi with the EthAPIBackend at eth/api_backend.go providing access to blockchain state.\n\nSources: internal/ethapi/api.go1-2400 eth/api_backend.go1-400 node/api.go1-500\n\nPost-merge, go-ethereum operates in tandem with a consensus layer client. The Engine API (eth/catalyst/api.go) implements the execution engine specification:\n\nAuthentication uses JWT tokens specified via --authrpc.jwtsecret. The API listens on port 8551 by default (configurable via --authrpc.port).\n\nFor development, the SimulatedBeacon at eth/catalyst/simulated_beacon.go provides a standalone mode (--dev) that automatically produces blocks without an external consensus client.\n\nSources: eth/catalyst/api.go1-868 eth/catalyst/simulated_beacon.go1-400\n\nThe build system at build/ci.go supports:\n\nThe codebase requires Go 1.23+ and a C compiler (for certain dependencies like KZG commitments).\n\nSources: build/ci.go1-1000 README.md16-31 Makefile1-100\n\nGo-ethereum is a complex, production-grade implementation of the Ethereum execution layer. Its architecture separates concerns into distinct subsystems (state, blockchain, networking, consensus integration) while maintaining clear interfaces between components. The configuration system provides flexibility for different network deployments, and the post-merge Engine API enables seamless integration with any compatible consensus client.\n\nFor deeper exploration of specific subsystems, refer to the subsequent pages in this wiki covering Node Lifecycle, Core Components, Networking, Storage, and APIs.",

    "description": "ETH Zurich researchers have developed a process that can be used on site to render environmental toxins such as DDT and lindane harmless and convert them into valuable chemicals – a breakthrough for the remediation of contaminated sites and a sustainable circular economy.",
    "fullText": "Persistent organic pollutants such as DDT and lindane still pollute the environment and affect humans decades after their use.\n\nETH researchers have developed a new electrochemical process that completely dehalogenates these long-lived toxins and converts them into valuable industrial chemicals.\n\nThe method uses cheap equipment, prevents side reactions and could be used on contaminated landfills, soils or sludge.\n\nMobile systems could be used on site in the future – an important step towards the remediation of contaminated sites and the creation of a sustainable circular economy.\n\nThey were once considered miracle workers – insecticides such as lindane or DDT were produced and used millions of times during the 20th century. But what was hailed as progress led to a global environmental catastrophe: persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are so chemically stable that they remain in soil, water and organisms for decades. They accumulate in the fatty tissue of animals and thus enter the human food chain. Many of these substances were banned long ago, but their traces can still be found today – even in human blood.\n\nHow to remediate such contaminated sites, be they soils, bodies of water or landfills, is one of the major unresolved questions of environmental protection. How can highly stable poisons be rendered harmless without creating new problems? Researchers at ETH Zurich, led by Bill Morandi, Professor of Synthetic Organic Chemistry, have now found a promising approach. Using an innovative electrochemical method, they are not only able to break down these long-lived pollutants but also to convert them into valuable raw materials for the chemical industry.\n\nA key distinction between this and previous work is that the carbon skeleton of the pollutants is recycled and made reusable, while the halide component is sequestered as a harmless inorganic salt. “The previous methods were also energetically inefficient,” says Patrick Domke, a doctoral student in Morandi’s group. He explains: “The processes were expensive and still led to outcomes that were harmful to the environment.”\n\nTogether with electrochemistry specialist Alberto Garrido-Castro, a former postdoc in this group, Domke developed a process that renders the pollutants in question completely harmless. During this project, the two researchers were able to draw on the many years of experience of ETH professor Morandi, who has been working on the transformation of such compounds for years. “The key advance of this new technology is the use of alternating current to sequester the problematic halogen atoms as innocuous salts such as NaCl (table salt), while still generating valuable hydrocarbons,” says Morandi.\n\nElectrolysis enables almost complete dehalogenation of pollutants under mild, environmentally friendly and cost-effective conditions. It cleaves the stable carbon-halogen bonds, leaving behind only harmless salts such as table salt and useful hydrocarbons such as benzene, diphenylethane or cyclododecatriene. These are actually sought-after intermediates in the chemical industry, for example, for plastics, varnishes, coatings and pharmaceutical applications. In this way, the technology not only contributes to the remediation of contaminated sites but also to the sustainable circular economy.\n\n“What makes our process so special from a technical point of view is that we supply electricity using alternating current, similar to the electrical waveform delivered to households. It is one of the most cost-effective resources in chemistry,” explains Garrido-Castro. “Alternating current protects the electrodes from wear, which is why we can reuse them for many subsequent electrolysis cycles. In addition, the alternating current suppresses unwanted side reactions and the formation of poisonous chlorine gas, allowing the pollutant’s halogen atoms to be fully converted to inorganic salts.” The reactor used by the researchers consists of an undivided electrolysis cell in which dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is used as a solvent – itself a by-product of the pulp process in paper production.\n\nThe process can be applied not only to pure substances but also to mixtures from contaminated soils. Soil or sludge can therefore be treated without pre-treatment or further separation processes. A prototype of the reactor has already been successfully tested on classic environmental toxins such as lindane and DDT. “Our system is mobile and can be assembled on site. This eliminates the need to transport these hazardous substances,” explains Domke.\n\nOn 27 November 2025 at ETH Zurich @ Open-i, ETH Zurich will award the Spark Award for the best invention of the year for the 14th time. The criteria for this award are originality, patent strength and market potential.\n\nSpark Award ceremony, Industry Day @ Open-i, Thursday, 27 November 2025, 1.30 p.m., Zurich Convention Center.

    "description": "A whole bag of peanuts, half a jar of peanut butter, a can of sardines, and one fateful sneeze taught me more about Google's algorithm than 20 years in SEO.",
    "fullText": "I want to tell you about the worst day of my life, and how it relates to your website's traffic. Bear with me. This is going somewhere. Probably.\n\nIt started, as most disasters do, with a series of small decisions that seemed fine at the time.\n\nI ate a whole bag of peanuts. Not a small bag. The Costco bag. The one that's meant for a family of four over the course of a month. I ate it in one sitting because it was there, on my desk, and I was reading something online, and my hand just kept going back to the bag. You know how it is. You're not even hungry. You're just... consuming. The bag was open. The peanuts were salted. One leads to another leads to another leads to you're holding an empty bag and your fingers are coated in salt residue and you're wondering what happened to your afternoon.\n\nThen I ate half a jar of peanut butter. Different peanut product, same energy. I had a spoon. I had the jar. I had time. What was I supposed to do, exercise restraint? Close the jar like some kind of adult? No. I kept going. Spoonful after spoonful, watching the peanut butter level descend like a slow tide going out, until I'd crossed the halfway mark and the shame set in and I finally stopped.\n\nThen, because apparently I had decided that today was the day I would test the structural limits of my gastrointestinal system, I ate a can of sardines.\n\nWhy sardines? I don't know. They were in the pantry. They're healthy, I think. Omega-3s. Good for the brain. I needed the protein to balance out the peanuts. That was my reasoning, anyway. The reasoning of a man who had already consumed roughly 4,000 calories of legume-based products and was now adding small oily fish to the mixture like a scientist who has lost control of his experiment but can't stop adding reagents.\n\nI sat back down at my computer. I was reading Hacker News. Everything seemed fine.\n\nJust once. A single sneeze. The kind of sneeze that comes out of nowhere, that ambushes you, that gives you no time to prepare. One second I'm reading a comment thread about Rust versus Go, and the next second my body is convulsing with a violent involuntary exhalation that starts in my sinuses and ends...\n\nI felt it immediately. The warmth. The wetness. The wrongness. That unmistakable sensation that tells you something has happened in your pants that should not have happened. That tells you the structural integrity of your afternoon has been compromised.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the term, and God bless you if you are, a shart is when you attempt to fart and something more substantial comes out. It is a portmanteau of two words that I will not spell out because this is a professional website about search engine optimization and I have some standards. A shart is a betrayal by your own body. A miscommunication between your brain and your bowels. A failure of the internal systems that are supposed to distinguish between gas and catastrophe.\n\nThe sneeze had triggered it. Some kind of pressure cascade. The peanuts and the peanut butter and the sardines, all that matter compressed into my digestive tract, and then the sneeze adding just enough additional force to push everything past the point of no return.\n\nI sat there for a moment. Very still. Assessing the situation. Hoping, somehow, that I was wrong. That the sensation I was feeling was something else, anything else. A figment. A false alarm.\n\nI stood up carefully, like a man defusing a bomb, and began the wobble to the bathroom. Every step was a negotiation. Every movement a risk assessment. I had to get there without making things worse, without spreading the damage, without turning a localized incident into a regional disaster.\n\nI made it. I discovered the horror. I will spare you the details except to say that it was worse than I had hoped and better than I had feared. I cleaned myself up as best I could with the materials available. But my underwear was ruined. There was no saving them. They were casualties of the peanut-sardine conflict, and they had to be disposed of.\n\nThis meant I needed new underwear. The new underwear was upstairs. I was downstairs. The stairs were between us.\n\nSo I began the ascent. Pants around my ankles, because putting them back on seemed wrong and also they needed to be washed. I was shuffling up the stairs like a penguin, like a man in shackles, like someone who had made a series of poor decisions and was now living the consequences of those decisions one humiliating step at a time.\n\nMy foot caught on my bunched-up pants. I pitched forward. I reached for the banister and missed. I went down.\n\nI will not describe the next forty-five seconds except to say that they involved tumbling, flailing, cursing, the reopening of issues I had thought resolved, the involvement of the carpet, and a final resting position at the bottom of the stairs that would have been difficult to explain to anyone who happened to walk in at that moment.\n\nI lay there, on the floor, in conditions I will not describe, and I thought to myself:\n\nThis is what happens when you overconsume and then something sneezes.\n\nI'm going to tell you something now that I've never told anyone. As I lay there on that carpet, in that condition, something clicked in my brain. Something about SEO. Something I'd been trying to understand for months.\n\nI finally understood the Helpful Content Update.\n\nSee, here's what happened to me that day. I consumed too much. Way too much. More than my system could process. Peanuts and peanut butter and sardines, all crammed in there, more than I needed, more than was healthy, more than my body could reasonably be expected to handle. And for a while, nothing happened. The system held. I sat at my computer, functioning normally, reading my Hacker News comments. From the outside, everything looked fine.\n\nAnd then one small trigger. One sneeze. One tiny additional pressure. And the whole system failed catastrophically.\n\nAnd then, when I tried to fix it, I made it worse. Every step I took to recover from the initial disaster led to a new disaster. The wobble to the bathroom. The trip upstairs. The fall on the stairs. Each attempted fix cascading into a fresh catastrophe. The recovery was worse than the initial incident.\n\nThat's what I've watched happen to websites since August 2022.\n\nFor years, websites did what I did with those peanuts. They consumed and consumed and consumed. Not peanuts, but content. AI content. Programmatic content. Template content. \"How to [verb] a [noun]\" times ten thousand. \"Best [product] for [use case]\" times infinity. Content not because users needed it but because the algorithm rewarded volume. Content as peanuts. Handful after handful. The bag is open. The rankings are rising. What are you supposed to do, stop?\n\nThey added more. They added links. They added schema. They added internal linking strategies so aggressive that every page linked to every other page in a great tangled web of self-reference. They added FAQ sections that answered questions nobody asked. They added author bios for authors who didn't exist. They added \"Last Updated\" timestamps that updated automatically whether anything had changed or not.\n\nThey stuffed themselves. Like me with the peanut butter. Spoonful after spoonful. They couldn't stop. The metrics kept going up. The content kept ranking. They crossed the halfway mark and kept going.\n\nAnd then they added the sardines. The guest posts. The link schemes. The PBNs. The \"digital PR\" that was really just paid placements with extra steps. The toxic stuff that should have stayed in the pantry. But it's healthy, they told themselves. It's good for the domain authority. It's omega-3s for the backlink profile.\n\nAnd for a while, it worked. They sat at their computers, watching the traffic, watching the revenue. Everything seemed fine.\n\nAugust 2022. The Helpful Content Update. Just one algorithm adjustment. A single sneeze. A small additional pressure on a system that was already holding too much.\n\nAnd websites across the internet sharted.\n\nTraffic down 40%. 60%. 90%. The warmth. The wetness. The wrongness. That unmistakable sensation that something has happened to your analytics that should not have happened. That tells you the structural integrity of your business model has been compromised.\n\nThey didn't understand it. They hadn't done anything wrong, they thought. They were just doing what everyone else was doing. Consuming content. Adding pages. Building links. The bag was open. The jar was there. What were they supposed to do?\n\nBut that was the problem. They'd consumed too much, and it was all still in there, all that undigested content and those dubious links and those programmatic pages that existed to game the algorithm rather than help users. And when the sneeze came, all of it came out at once.\n\nAnd then they tried to fix it. Like me wobbling to the bathroom. Like me shuffling up the stairs with my pants around my ankles. Every step careful. Every movement a risk.\n\nThey deleted content. Not strategically, but in a panic. Mass deletions. Thousands of pages, gone. They didn't know which pages were the problem, so they deleted all of them. They didn't realize that deleting content creates its own problems. Broken internal links. 404 errors. Orphaned pages. The carpet was getting involved.\n\nThey disavowed links. All of them. The bad ones and the good ones. They didn't know which links were toxic, so they nuked the entire backlink profile. Years of legitimate link building, gone. They'd just kneecapped their own authority because they were panicking.\n\nThey rewrote their content. Added more E-E-A-T signals. Author bios for authors who still didn't exist, but now with LinkedIn profiles that were created last week. \"Expert\" quotes from \"industry professionals\" they'd invented. They were trying to fix the problem by adding more of the thing that had caused the problem. They were eating more peanuts to settle their stomach.\n\nThe September update hit. The October update hit. The November update hit. Each one catching them mid-recovery, each one sending them tumbling again, each one finding some new problem they'd created while trying to fix the last problem. They were at the bottom of the stairs now, in a condition they couldn't explain to anyone who walked in.\n\nHere's what I realized, lying on that carpet in my condition. Here's the thing that clicked.\n\nThe sneeze wasn't the problem. The fall on the stairs wasn't the problem. The problem was everything that came before. The problem was the consumption. The peanuts and the peanut butter and the sardines. The content and the links and the programmatic pages. All that stuff I'd crammed into my system because it was there, because it was easy, because everyone else was doing it, because it felt good in the moment.\n\nThe sneeze just revealed what was already true. The fall just accelerated what was already happening. The carpet just... look, I don't want to extend this metaphor any further than I already have.\n\nThe Helpful Content Update didn't break these websites. These websites were already broken. They were held together by algorithmic tolerance and competitor mediocrity. They were ranking not because they deserved to rank but because everyone else was doing the same thing and Google hadn't gotten around to fixing it yet.\n\nThe sneeze was coming. It was always coming. The only question was when.\n\nI eventually got up off that carpet. I cleaned myself up again. I found new underwear. I washed everything that needed washing, including the carpet. It took a while. It was unpleasant. But I recovered.\n\nI also changed my diet. Not because I'm some kind of health guru now, but because I learned something that day about what happens when you overconsume. When you cram things into your system just because they're there. When you optimize for short-term satisfaction at the expense of long-term structural integrity.\n\nThe websites that recovered from the Helpful Content Update did something similar. They didn't just delete and disavow and panic-rewrite. They fundamentally changed their approach. They stopped consuming content for consumption's sake. They stopped building links for link metrics' sake. They stopped stuffing themselves with peanuts just because the bag was open.\n\nThey started asking a question that seems obvious but apparently wasn't: does this actually help anyone?\n\nNot \"will this rank?\" Not \"will this build authority?\" Not \"will this fill out our content calendar?\" Just: does this help anyone? Would a human being, with a real question, find value in this?\n\nIf the answer was no, they didn't publish it. Revolutionary.\n\nI'm not proud of what happened to me that day. I don't tell this story at parties. I've never told it to anyone, actually, until now, to you, the stranger reading an SEO blog on the internet. I hope you appreciate the vulnerability involved here. I hope you understand what it costs me to share this.\n\nBut I'm telling you because I need you to understand something about the Helpful Content Update and all the updates that have come after it. Something that I didn't understand until I was lying on a carpet at the bottom of the stairs in a condition I still have nightmares about.\n\nThe problem is never the sneeze. The problem is what you've been putting into your system. The problem is the overconsumption. The problem is the peanuts and the peanut butter and the sardines, consumed not because you needed them but because they were there, because it was easy, because what were you supposed to do, stop?\n\nYes. You were supposed to stop.\n\nYou were supposed to look at the bag and think about whether you actually needed more peanuts. You were supposed to put down the spoon before you hit the halfway mark on the peanut butter. You were supposed to leave the sardines in the pantry, where they belong, because nobody needs that much protein and omega-3s are not worth what comes next.\n\nYou were supposed to build a website that helps people instead of a website that games algorithms. You were supposed to create content because you had something to say, not because you had a content calendar to fill. You were supposed to earn links because you made something worth linking to, not because you had a \"link velocity target.\"\n\nAnd if you didn't do those things, if you consumed and consumed and consumed until your system was packed full of stuff that had no business being in there, then the sneeze was coming. It was always coming. The only question was when.\n\nFor me, the sneeze came on a Tuesday, while reading Hacker News, after a regrettable series of dietary choices.\n\nFor your website, the sneeze came in August 2022. Or September 2023. Or March 2024. Or it's coming. It's still coming. Google keeps sneezing. And every time it sneezes, more websites discover what they've been holding inside them all along.\n\nI no longer eat whole bags of peanuts. I no longer follow half a bag of peanuts with half a jar of peanut butter. I definitely no longer add sardines to that combination. I've learned to consume in moderation. To stop before I'm overfull. To leave things in the pantry.\n\nThis has made me a healthier person. It has also dramatically reduced the number of carpet-related incidents in my life, which I think we can all agree is a good thing.\n\nI would recommend a similar approach to your SEO strategy.\n\nStop stuffing your site with content you don't need. Stop building links you can't justify. Stop adding pages just because your competitors have pages. Stop consuming just because the bag is open.\n\nBecause the sneeze is coming. It's always coming. And when it comes, you're going to find out what you're really made of.\n\nI found out what I was really made of that day on the stairs. Peanuts and peanut butter and sardines, mostly. It was not a pleasant discovery.\n\nI hope your website holds up better than my underwear did.\n\nThe author has since recovered fully, both digestively and psychologically. The carpet was professionally cleaned. The underwear was not salvageable.",

    "fullText": "POPOCATÉPETL VOLCANO, Mexico (AP) — In the predawn darkness, a team of scientists climbs the slope of Mexico's Popocatépetl volcano, one of the world’s most active and whose eruption could affect millions of people. Its mission: figure out what is happening under the crater.\n\nFor five years, the group from Mexico’s National Autonomous University has climbed the volcano with kilos of equipment, risked data loss due to bad weather or a volcanic explosion and used artificial intelligence to analyze the seismic data. Now, the team has created the first three-dimensional image of the whole 17,883-foot (5,452-meter) volcano’s interior, which tells them where the magma accumulates and will help them better understand its activity, and, eventually, help authorities better react to eruptions.\n\nMarco Calò, professor in the UNAM's Geophysics Institute’s vulcanology department and the project leader, invited The Associated Press to accompany the team on its most recent expedition, the last before its research on the volcano will be published.\n\nInside an active volcano, everything is moving: the rocks, magma, gas and aquifers. It all generates seismic signals.\n\nMost of the world’s volcanoes that pose a risk to humans already have detailed maps of their interiors, but not Popocatépetl, despite the fact that some 25 million people live within a 62-mile (100 kilometers) radius and houses, schools, hospitals and five airports could be affected by an eruption.\n\nOther scientists took some early images 15 years ago, but they showed contradictory results and did not have sufficient resolution to see “how the volcanic edifice was being built,” and above all, where the magma gathered, Calò said.\n\nHis team increased the number of seismographs from the 12 provided by Mexico’s National Disaster Prevention Center to 22 to cover the entire perimeter of the volcano. Even though just three can alert to an emergency, many more are needed to understand what is behind those emergencies.\n\nThe devices measure vibrations in the ground 100 times per second and generate data that Karina Bernal, 33, a doctoral student and researcher on the project, processed by using artificial intelligence to adapt algorithms developed for other volcanoes.\n\n“I taught the machine about the different types of tremors there are in El Popo” and with that they were able to catalog the different kinds of seismic signals, she said.\n\nLittle by little the scientists began to infer what kinds of material were where, in what state, at what temperature and at what depth. Later they were able to map it.\n\nThe result is far more complex than the drawings of volcanoes most saw in school, with a main vent connecting a chamber of magma with the surface.\n\nThis first three-dimensional cross-sectional image goes 11 miles (18 kilometers) below the crater and shows what appear to be various pools of magma at different depths, with rock or other material between them and more numerous toward the southeast of the crater.\n\nPopocatépetl emerged in the crater of other volcanoes in its current form more than 20,000 years ago and has been active since 1994, spewing plumes of smoke, gas and ash more or less daily. The activity periodically forms a dome over the main vent, which eventually collapses, causing an eruption. The last was in 2023.\n\nCalò, a 46-year-old Sicilian, speaks passionately about El Popo, as Mexicans call the volcano, rattling off trivia.\n\nHe explains that its height can change because of eruptions and recounts how Popocatépetl, in the first century, had its own “little Pompeii” when a village on its flanks, Tetimpa, was buried in ash. In the early 20th century, it was human actions — using dynamite to extract sulfur from the crater — that provoked an eruption. And even though El Popo emanates more greenhouse gases than almost any other volcano, its emissions are still a small fraction of what humans generate in nearby Mexico City.\n\nFor years Calò studied volcanic activity from his computer, but trying to “understand how something works without touching it” spurred a feeling of disappointment, he said.\n\nThat changed with Popocatépetl, a volcano he describes as “majestic.”\n\nAfter hours of walking up the volcano’s flank, Calò’s team sets up camp in a pine grove at about 12,500 feet of elevation, an apparent safe spot from pyroclastic explosions, since the trees have managed to grow to significant height.\n\nA short distance higher on the mountain, the trees and scrub give way to ash and sediment.\n\nThey must cross a lahar, a mixture of rock and ash that during the rainy season becomes a dangerous mudflow carrying away everything in its path. Now, the dry clearing provides a spectacular view: to the east the Pico de Orizaba — Mexico’s tallest volcano and mountain and the dormant volcano La Malinche; to the north, Iztaccíhuatl, an inactive volcanic peak known as “the sleeping woman.”\n\nPopocatépetl’s sounds seem to multiply at night with the echoes. An explosion like a rocket might sound like it’s coming from one direction, but a puff of smoke from the crater belies the real source.\n\nKarina Rodríguez, a 26-year-old master’s student on the team, said you can also hear small tremors in the earth or even ash falling like rain when the volcano is more active. On dark nights, the rim of the crater glows orange.\n\nHaving direct knowledge of the volcano provides a much more objective sense of the limits of their analysis, Calò said.\n\n“We have a natural laboratory here,” he said. It’s “very important to be able to understand and give residents detailed, trustworthy information about what is happening inside the volcano.”\n\nAt 13,780 feet (4,200 meters), their backpacks full of computers, equipment to analyze gases, batteries and water begin to weigh more and their pace slows.\n\nAsh, dark and warm, dominates the landscape here.\n\nAt a seismographic station, the team digs up the equipment and celebrates that it’s still working. They download its data and rebury it.\n\nA “volcanic bomb,” a rock a yard and a half in diameter and weighing tons, marks the way and gives an idea of what the start of an eruption can mean. That is why the top area of the volcano is restricted, though not everyone pays heed. In 2022, a person died after being hit by a rock about 300 yards (meters) from the crater.\n\nA bottle of tequila near a rocky hollow, known as El Popo’s belly button, hints at some of the traditions surrounding the volcano, including an annual pilgrimage to what some consider a point of connection to the underworld.\n\nDigging up one of the last seismic stations, Calò’s face falls. The last registered data are from months earlier. The battery died. Sometimes rats chew the machines’ wires or an explosion causes more serious damage.\n\nThe project has yielded some certainties and if repeated will allow the analysis of changes that eventually will help authorities make better decisions when eruptions occur.\n\nBut Calò says that, as always happens with science, it has also generated new questions that they will have to try to address, like why the tremors are more frequent on the southeast side — where there is more accumulated magma — and what implications that could have.\n\nThis was the last expedition before their years of work to map the volcano’s interior is published. Watching the volcano’s interior move in 3D on a computer screen makes all of the effort worthwhile.\n\n“It’s what drives you to start another project and keep climbing,” Rodríguez, the master's student, said.",

    "description": "Solar farms are already proving to be an effective addition to traditional power, but now it looks like they may have additional environmental benefits.",
    "fullText": "The world's largest cluster of solar farms can be found in Qinghai, China, high on the remote Tibetan Plateau. It's far bigger than the USA's largest solar farm, and it's one of several megaprojects that the Chinese government hopes will push the country towards a future where most of its electricity is produced from renewable resources. The Qinghai cluster can produce almost 17,000 megawatts of power, according to the New York Times, but it isn't just a huge producer of energy.\n\nA study published in the Nature journal also claims that the presence of miles of solar panels changes the desert environment around the farm, and actually helps improve the biodiversity of the surrounding area. The study analysed a wide range of environmental factors, including the nutrients in the soil around the solar farms, the range of plant and microbial species that lived there, and the humidity of the surrounding air.\n\nResearchers found that the presence of the solar farm helped boost moisture levels in the soil, which in turn affected its structure. They suggested that the increased moisture could be due to the panels absorbing most of the Sun's radiation, which led to the soil underneath losing less water through evaporation. The regular washing of the panels was also noted as a potential reason for the increased soil moisture content.\n\nThe improved condition of the soil helped a wider variety of microbes and plants live within the grounds of the solar farm than in the surrounding desert. It's fresh evidence that, as well as helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by providing clean electricity, solar panels can also help the environment in more unexpected ways. The study also noted that the solar farm required local workers to operate, which helped boost jobs in an area where there were otherwise relatively few opportunities for employment.\n\nChina has an advantage when it comes to creating giant solar farms, since most of the world's solar cell supply comes from Chinese manufacturers. It also has a huge domestic demand for electricity, particularly since it's the world's largest EV market by a significant margin. According to IEA, 17 million EVs were sold worldwide in 2024, and more than 11 million of those were sold in China. Around 10% of all cars on the road in China are electric, and to power them, the country will need to keep developing projects like the Qinghai solar farm cluster. If it keeps building them within its vast deserts, these farms will potentially have the bonus side effect of improving the quality of the environment around them, too.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "fullText": "Imagine finally buying your dream car after years of hard work and driving it every day with pride, only to discover that a device installed in your vehicle is allegedly faking compliance with a key feature for which the brand is known.\n\nA German luxury automaker founded in 1926, the Mercedes-Benz Group (MBGYY) touts its \"The best or nothing\" slogan. The company is renowned for its high-end vehicles, groundbreaking automotive technological innovations, and commitment to sustainable mobility.\n\nHowever, its reputation may have just been tainted after a recent allegation led the company to pay a hefty price.\n\nMercedes-Benz USA and its parent company, Daimler AG, have agreed to pay a $149.6 million settlement following allegations that the automaker installed emission-cheating devices in more than 211,000 vehicles.\n\nAccording to the Delaware Department of Justice, the devices allowed the vehicles to pass emissions tests while violating state laws prohibiting unfair or deceptive trade practices. The settlement also includes more than $200 million in potential consumer relief.\n\nThe agreement applies to approximately 39,565 vehicles that had not been repaired or permanently removed from the road by August 1, 2023. Owners of those vehicles may be eligible to receive $2,000 per vehicle.\n\n\"For nearly a decade, Mercedes sold vehicles that were marketed as clean and environmentally responsible while secretly polluting far beyond legal limits,\" said Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings in the filing.\n\n\"This settlement holds Mercedes accountable for deceiving consumers, evading emissions laws, and putting public health at risk. We expect honesty in the marketplace and clean air in our communities. Today’s agreement delivers both meaningful penalties and real relief for affected drivers.\"\n\nUnder the settlement, Mercedes-Benz USA will pay the state $120 million. An additional $29.7 million will be suspended and may be waived if the company completes a comprehensive consumer relief program.\n\nThe agreement is still subject to court approval.\n\nVehicle emissions are among the largest contributors to air pollution in Delaware, making compliance with emissions control regulations critical to maintaining air quality, according to Delaware Department of Natural Resources & Environmental Control Secretary Greg Patterson.\n\nThe complaint alleges that between 2008 and 2016, Mercedes-Benz USA installed devices in more than 211,000 vehicles that allowed the cars to exceed legal limits for nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions while appearing compliant during testing. Despite this, the vehicles were marketed as environmentally friendly and fully compliant with emissions regulations.",

    "description": "Artists are canceling shows after Trump’s name went on the Kennedy Center. Ric Grenell denies the link and threatens critics to silence dissent.",
    "fullText": "The renaming of the Kennedy Center triggered immediate fallout. Artists canceled performances. Longstanding relationships fractured. Programming began disappearing from the calendar. Ric Grenell’s response has been to insist none of this is his doing, and to threaten those who say otherwise.\n\nAfter the Trump-appointed board voted to add President Donald Trump’s name to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, cancellations followed quickly. A veteran jazz ensemble walked away from New Year’s Eve shows. A Christmas Eve jazz concert that had run for nearly two decades was called off. A New York dance company withdrew anniversary performances at a cost of $40,000. These were not symbolic gestures. They involved real money, professional risk, and decisions artists did not make lightly.\n\nGrenell, the Kennedy Center’s interim president/executive director and a senior Trump loyalist, responded by denying the causal relationship everyone could see. He insisted that adding Trump’s name “depoliticized” the institution. He also insisted that artists who withdrew were “far-left political activists,” acting for political reasons. In Grenell’s telling, the renaming did nothing, and the reaction proved everything.\n\nThat position requires believing that politics entered the Kennedy Center only when artists objected to the renaming, not when the renaming happened.\n\nGrenell did more than deny causality. He escalated. After Chuck Redd, the longtime host of the canceled Christmas Eve jazz concert, pulled out, Grenell publicly threatened him with a $1 million lawsuit. The message was unmistakable. Question the takeover and face consequences.\n\nThis is the point where denial turns into intimidation.\n\nThe artists who canceled did not issue partisan manifestos. The Cookers, a veteran all-star jazz septet featuring musicians with decades-long careers, spoke about jazz’s roots in freedom of expression. Doug Varone, the founder of a nationally respected contemporary dance company scheduled to mark its 40th anniversary at the center, described withdrawing as financially devastating but morally clarifying. These statements point in the same direction. The artists responded to a change in the institution itself, not to some abstract ideological grievance.\n\nGrenell’s response reframes that reality. By labeling dissenting artists extremists, he shifts attention away from the political act that set everything in motion. By threatening legal action, he discourages others from making the same connection publicly. Denial becomes policy, and enforcement follows.\n\nGrenell insists the arts are now “for everyone.” His actions define the terms of inclusion. Artists remain welcome as long as they perform without objection and accept the renaming as settled. Compliance is the price of neutrality. Artists who withdraw their labor are recast as political saboteurs. In this framework, politics is invisible when exercised by those in charge and intolerable when named by those affected.\n\nThe cost of this strategy is no longer theoretical. It is visible on the schedule. Performances have vanished. Institutions do not lose artists this way when they are perceived as neutral ground. They lose artists when trust breaks.\n\nGrenell has shamelessly argued that Trump “saved” the Kennedy Center. That claim is now testable. A saved institution does not hemorrhage programming weeks after a rebrand. A healthy cultural center does not require threats to maintain compliance. A revitalized stage does not grow quieter.\n\nThe political renaming backfired. The cancellations were the response. Grenell’s denial and intimidation are the attempt to erase that sequence.\n\nThe calendar keeps the record anyway.\n\nThe post The Trump-Kennedy Center Backfired. Ric Grenell Is Gaslighting Everyone first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — The White House cannot lapse in its funding of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal district court judge ruled on Tuesday, only days before funds at the bureau would have likely run out and the consumer finance agency would have no money to pay its employees.\n\nJudge Amy Berman ruled that the CFPB should continue to get its funds from the Federal Reserve, despite the Fed operating at a loss, and that the White House's new legal argument about how the CFPB gets its funds is not valid.\n\nAt the heart of this case is whether Russell Vought, President Donald Trump's budget director and the acting director of the CFPB, can effectively shut down the agency and lay off all of the bureau's employees. The CFPB has largely been inoperable since President Trump has sworn into office nearly a year ago. Its employees are mostly forbidden from doing any work, and most of the bureau's operations this year has been to unwind the work it did under President Biden and even under Trump's first term.\n\nVought himself has made comments where he has made it clear that his intention is to effectively shut down the CFPB. The White House earlier this year issued a “reduction in force” for the CFPB, which would have furloughed or laid off much of the bureau.\n\nThe National Treasury Employees Union, which represents the workers at the CFPB, has been mostly successful in court to stop the mass layoffs and furloughs. The union sued Vought earlier this year and won a preliminary injunction stopping the layoffs while the union's case continues through the legal process.\n\nIn recent weeks, the White House has used a new line of argument to potentially get around the court's injunction. The argument is that the Federal Reserve has no “combined earnings” at the moment to fund the CFPB’s operations. The CFPB gets its funding from the Fed through expected quarterly payments.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been operating at a paper loss since 2022 as a result of the central bank trying to combat inflation, the first time in the Fed's entire history its been operating at a loss. The Fed holds bonds on its balance sheet from a period of low interest rates during the COVID-19 pandemic, but currently has to pay out higher interest rates to banks who hold their deposits at the central bank. The Fed has been recording a “deferred asset” on its balance sheet which it expects will be paid down in the next few years as the low interest bonds mature off the Fed's balance sheet.\n\nBecause of this loss on paper, the White House has argued there are no “combined earnings” for the CFPB to draw on. The CFPB has operated since 2011, including under President Trump’s first term, drawing on the Fed’s operating budget.\n\nWhite House lawyers sent a notice to the court in early November, where they argued that the CFPB would run out of appropriations in early 2026, using the “combined earnings” argument, and does not expect to get any additional appropriations from Congress.\n\nThis combined earnings legal argument is not entirely new. It has floated in conservative legal circles going back to when the Federal Reserve started operating at a loss. The Office of Legal Counsel, which acts as the government's legal advisors, adopted this legal theory in a memo on November 7. However, this idea has never been tested in court.\n\nIn her opinion, Berman said the OLC and Vought were using this legal theory to get around the court's injunction instead of allowing the case to be decided on merits. A trial on whether the CFPB employees' union can sue Vought over the layoffs is currently scheduled for February 2026.\n\n“It appears that defendants’ new understanding of “combined earnings” is an unsupported and transparent attempt to starve the CPFB of funding and yet another attempt to achieve the very end the Court’s injunction was put in place to prevent,\" Berman wrote in an opinion.\n\n“We’re very pleased that the court made clear what should have been obvious: Vought can’t justify abandoning the agency’s obligations or violating a court order by manufacturing a lack of funding,” said Jennifer Bennett of Gupta Wessler LLP, who is representing the CFPB employees in the case.\n\nA White House spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Berman's opinion.",

    "description": "The once popular sandwich chain has had a major fall from grace.",
    "fullText": "Folks of a certain age know the sandwich brand Blimpie and the fact that it was once a major rival of Subway.\n\nBut the sandwich chain has seen its share of struggles through the years, and is going through its own hard times. In fact, it has closed nearly 2,000 locations, with only under 100 left nationwide, per TheStreet.\n\nFor such a popular sandwich brand, this is a huge fall from grace.\n\nSadly for Blimpie, it shares a connection with a well-known sandwich chain that’s on top of its game — Jersey Mike’s.\n\n“Founded in Hoboken, New Jersey, in 1964 by three partners who borrowed $2,500 to launch their first sandwich shop, Blimpie was initially modeled on a venture called Mike’s Submarines (which would later become Jersey Mike’s), selling a very similar lineup of sandwiches,” The Takeout reported.\n\nBut things began to shift for Blimpie after a new owner took over in 2001, and the chain began to scale back.\n\n“Some of the factors that triggered Blimpie’s fall from grace included poor management decisions and overexpansion in poorly chosen areas. One of the chain’s biggest blunders was its attempt to branch into unconventional spaces like convenience stores, kiosks, and carts. These ventures failed to generate meaningful profits,” the website shared.\n\nSince Kahala Brands swooped in and bought the chain back in 2006, Blimpie has continued to struggle.\n\n“Blimpie accumulated challenges and missteps proved too great; it continued to falter, closing over 1,000 locations between 2001 and 2011 to reach its current count of fewer than 100 stores,” Food Republic reported.\n\nIn 1964, Blimpie first opened in Hoboken, New Jersey, per a press release. According to its website, by the mid 90s, the sandwich chain surpassed 1000 locations nationwide and internationally during its growth phase, peaking at 2,000 stores in 2002, according to Mashed.\n\nNow, in 2025, recent data shows Blimpie has shrunk to approximately 95 stores nationwide.",

    "description": "Ukraine uses robots to evacuate injured troops, but it can also make them into targets.",
    "fullText": "New video footage from Russia's war against Ukraine shows a ground robot transporting an injured Ukrainian soldier being hit by a Russian drone.\n\nUsing ground robots to rescue soldiers is just one way Ukraine is putting its growing fleet to work. The uncrewed vehicles also move supplies, lay and remove mines, and attack Russian targets. Employing bots for battlefield casualty evacuation helps keep medical crews out of harm's way, but it can also leave an injured soldier exposed and vulnerable to attack.\n\nUkraine's 1st Separate Medical Battalion shared the footage on Monday, revealing that the soldier was safely evacuated. The rescue robot took the hit and protected him. The soldier didn't sustain any additional injuries during the 3-hour and 25-minute mission.\n\nThe soldier had been injured by a drone drop and was unable to walk by himself. Reaching him meant navigating territory with a significant Russian presence, and the planned return journey was 36 miles.\n\nA post shared by Перший окремий медичний батальйон (@1med.army)\n\nThey decided to send a robot controlled from afar by soldiers in safer positions, the battalion said. Ukraine uses robots to carry out missions too hazardous for humans.\n\nThe robot detected a Russian drone soon after the injured soldier was loaded on, the battalion said. The team decided to continue moving at maximum speed, but the drone hit the robot on its second attempt, two and a half miles into the journey.\n\nThe soldier did not suffer any new injuries from the attack, as he was contained in the robot's armored capsule. The robot, however, was damaged, the battalion said.\n\nHe was evacuated by another Ukrainian unit nearby and got the treatment he needed, it said. The robot was also recovered. Business Insider was unable to independently verify the details reported by the battalion.\n\nThe video shows a ground robot moving through a rural area at night, stopping as soldiers load an injured comrade aboard and close a protective lid. The robot then drives on, before aerial footage appears to show an explosion above it.\n\nThe video then shows the wounded soldier speaking after the mission, along with footage of the damaged robot. The battalion said his treatment is continuing.\n\nA host of companies are developing Ukraine's robot fleet, and innovation is rapid, with soldiers even updating them on the battlefield.\n\nHowever, they are risky, particularly if they lack cages like the one in this attack. Robots are targets for Russia's swarms of ever-present drones.\n\nOleksandr Yabchanka, the head of the robotic systems for Ukraine's Da Vinci Wolves Battalion, previously told Business Insider that using robots can sometimes put the soldier at greater risk, as it takes them from where they may have been able to hide or be with comrades out into the open.\n\nThey use humans for evacuations where possible, though that isn't without risks, and robots as a last resort.\n\nGround robots conduct less than 1% of Ukraine's drone missions; however, their use is growing. And the West is testing and prototyping uncrewed vehicle designs relying on what Ukraine is learning.",

    "description": "This budget-friendly, easy-to-prepare bean salad is filling and full of protein and fiber, so you can make a satisfying lunch for cheap.",
    "fullText": "To secure a spot in my meal-prep rotation, a recipe has to be packed with protein, fiber, and flavor. So, it's no surprise that bean salad has become my most beloved midday meal.\n\nBean salads have been around for centuries, but I came across the idea more recently thanks to Violet Witchel, a food influencer whose \"dense\" variations went viral in 2024.\n\nOver the past few months, my roommate and I have consistently turned to Witchel's recipes — or our own inspired spinoffs — to craft nutritious, easy-to-store lunches we're actually excited to eat.\n\nMy favorite version is made up of only six ingredients, and one serving (roughly) contains over 20 grams of protein, 10 grams of fiber, and 25 grams of carbohydrates.\n\nI use the ingredients below in my salad, which takes about 15 minutes to prep:\n\nAfter gathering the ingredients, chop the onion, tomatoes, and cucumber into bite-sized pieces, drain the chickpeas and cannellini beans, and then mix them all together with the feta and olive oil.\n\nAdd salt and pepper to taste, and serve it alongside pita bread.\n\nTypically, this recipe yields four to five servings, making it the perfect lunch to prepare on a Sunday afternoon and store in your refrigerator.\n\nUnlike some food trends, most bean salads are dietitian-approved (as long as you make them correctly).\n\n\"They're essentially like a gateway to eating more vegetables and getting in more fiber, protein, and potentially more color,\" Cassandra Lepore, a registered dietitian, told Business Insider.\n\nIn addition to having a strong nutritional profile, Lepore said, beans are also one of the most cost-effective ingredients.\n\nUnlike some types of produce, which may start to wilt or rot after a week, beans can be stored in a pantry for months — or even years. I usually stock up on cans so I can make this salad at a moment's notice.\n\nThese types of salads are also easy to customize, but you'll want to ensure that any spinoff maintains a \"good mixture of carbohydrates, protein, fiber, and healthy fats,\" Lepore told BI.\n\nHealthy fats, like olive oil, typically come from the salad dressing, she said, and beans can be a source of carbohydrates, protein, and fiber.\n\n\"I really would recommend ensuring that there's a great balance of all of those key macronutrients so the salad is filling you up, you're staying satiated, and you're not ravenous for your next meal or snack right after eating it,\" Lepore added.\n\nWith a mix of carbohydrates, protein, fiber, and healthy fats, my go-to bean salad checks all of those key boxes for me. However, if my recipe doesn't work with your nutrition goals, it can be adjusted.\n\nFor example, the dietitian recommended adding sweet or white potatoes for more carbohydrates, greens for extra fiber, and nuts for a protein boost.\n\nBeans are one of the foods I eat most frequently. As a result, my body has become well-equipped at handling such a fiber-rich salad on a regular basis. However, that may not be the case for everyone.\n\n\"If you are going to meal prep a bean salad, start slow, especially if there is going to be a significant amount of fiber,\" Lepore told BI. \"Maybe don't meal prep it Sunday night and have it Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday for lunch.\"\n\nShe said that consuming too much fiber when your body isn't used to it can lead to gastrointestinal issues such as bloating or gas.\n\nTo play it safe, try incorporating this recipe — or a variation of it — into your diet one day a week and see how you feel. And, as always, make sure to speak with your healthcare provider about what makes the most sense for your specific nutritional needs.",

    "fullText": "As a child, I spent many happy summers in Greece on the rather beautiful — albeit hard and expensive to get to — island of Alonissos.\n\nHowever, it was only when I moved to Thessaloniki in my mid-20s for my master's degree that I realized I'd largely overlooked the Greek mainland.\n\nPacked with historical sites, sun-drenched beaches, and diverse landscapes and cuisine, these six mainland gems rival any island postcard and deserve a spot on your next Greek itinerary.\n\nGreece's second-largest city is not only known as the country's gastronomic capital (definitely stop by restaurants like Kanoula or The Rouga), but it's also affectionately known as the home of \"halara.\"\n\nMeaning \"chill\" or \"take it easy,\" the word denotes a more laid-back pace of life than in the capital, Athens.\n\nI've always felt this relaxed vibe had much to do with the city's proximity to the Thermaic Gulf, which is best experienced with a stroll down the waterfront.\n\nThessaloniki is also rich in history and culture, home to the Rotunda (a Roman monument from the 4th century), Hagia Sophia Church, a Jewish Museum, and a world-class film festival.\n\nNot long after I moved to Greece, some of my classmates and I visited the Meteora monasteries, a UNESCO World Heritage site located in the central Thessaly region.\n\nAlthough I'd pored over pictures, the sheer beauty and surreality of the monasteries, built and renovated between the 14th and 16th centuries on top of incredible peaks, completely floored me.\n\nWe hiked some of the trails and visited a few of the monasteries — the steep stairs were completely worth it for the views. Plus, the autumnal colors of the time made the landscape even more dramatic.\n\nMore adventurous visitors can also explore the area by paragliding or rock climbing.\n\nMy next mission is to visit the monasteries during Easter and experience centuries-old traditions in this unforgettable setting.\n\nHalkidiki's three peninsulas (also known as \"fingers\" or \"legs\") — Kassandra, Sithonia, and Athos — host some of the country's best beaches.\n\nA couple of my favorites are Karydi and Fava Beach, located in the village of Vourvourou on Sithonia, about two hours from Thessaloniki.\n\nIn the village, I recommend stopping at Anchor Foodbar for an excellent brunch — my university friends and I went almost every day during our trip last year. The Greek-style shakshuka and yogurt bowl with tahini and poached pear was next level.\n\nAbout halfway between Athens and Thessaloniki lies Pelion, a peninsula that juts into the Aegean Sea and curves back toward the mainland.\n\nThe hills are thick with chestnut trees and myths, as Jason (of Jason and the Argonauts) was said to have been raised by the centaur Chiron on Mount Pelion.\n\nMy friends and I visited Milies, a quiet village on the peninsula with cobbled streets, old stone houses, and a historic steam train, Moutzouris.\n\nMentioning Athens isn't exactly original, but there's a reason it shows up in every travel guide. It's the capital, after all, and home to some of the most iconic historical landmarks, from the Parthenon to the Theatre of Dionysus.\n\nStill, I'd been to Greece nearly 20 times before I finally made it to Athens, and when I did go, the city surprised me.\n\nYes, the ruins are incredible, but so is the energy — street art, rooftop bars, and a food scene that combines tradition and creativity.\n\nMy favorite neighborhoods are the offbeat Exarchia, the creative Kypseli, and the old-school Petralona.",

    "fullText": "A new year means new opportunities to travel. And if you're anything like me, you're probably already thinking about where to go in 2026.\n\nAfter visiting all 50 states, there are a few places that have really stood out to me. If traveling more is one of your New Year's resolutions, I recommend checking out these nine incredible destinations.\n\nI love visiting Teton Valley, Idaho — the area located on the Western side of the Teton Mountain Range.\n\nDriggs, Victor, and Tetonia are all great little towns in the region. I especially love floating on the Teton River through Driggs and exploring downtown Victor.\n\nThe area is also a great base for day trips to Grand Teton or Yellowstone National Parks, making it a quieter way to enjoy the Tetons without the crowds.\n\nNorthern New Mexico is the place I've come back to the most over the last decade.\n\nThe wide-open skies and landscapes are unlike anywhere else, making every visit feel completely unforgettable and unique. I recommend staying in Taos, Santa Fe, or Abiquiú.\n\nI always enjoy exploring the Ojo Caliente Hot Springs or hiking around Ghost Ranch — a national natural landmark and former home of Georgia O'Keeffe.\n\nMendocino County in California is one of my all-time favorite places to visit. I love hiking through the coastal beauty of Russian Gulch and Mendocino Headlands State Parks, before glamping at Mendocino Grove.\n\nThe town of Mendocino itself is full of charm — colorful storefronts, cozy cafés, and galleries tucked along tree-lined streets with an ocean view. It's the perfect mix of outdoor adventure and slow, small-town California coastal charm.\n\nCharleston, South Carolina, is one of those cities I always find myself coming back to.\n\nI love wandering around the historic French Quarter and South of Broad areas, strolling along the Battery, enjoying Lowcountry cuisine, and browsing the boutiques and galleries.\n\nIn my opinion, Charleston is one of the most charming places in the country.\n\nAlthough I think Montana is worth visiting in its entirety, I love spending time in Glacier National Park. The mountains are massive and create the kind of scenes that make you stop and stare.\n\nWhether I'm hiking along alpine trails (I recommend the Highline and Avalanche Lake trails), driving down the iconic 50-mile scenic Going-to-the-Sun Road through the park, or just pausing to take in the views at Lake McDonald, the landscape here never fails to amaze me.\n\nCumberland Island, Georgia, is a wild and peaceful barrier island with 17.5 miles of undeveloped beaches and free-roaming wild horses.\n\nWhen I visited, I biked past the ruins of the 19th century Dungeness Mansion, explored the Plum Orchard mansion, and visited the First African Baptist Church, where John F. Kennedy Jr. and Carolyn Bessette were married.\n\nOverall, it's a very unique, seemingly untouched place to visit.\n\nWestern North Carolina is one of my favorite parts of the country. I love exploring the towns around Asheville — Hendersonville, Boone, and Brevard.\n\nThe latter is my favorite, with the Brevard Music Center bringing classical performances to the mountains each summer. Plus, there are plenty of opportunities for outdoor recreation nearby.\n\nBetween the waterfalls, hiking trails, and small-town vibes, it's a part of the state I keep coming back to.\n\nI've visited Alaska many times and it's massive. Because of its size, though, it can sometimes be challenging to navigate, which is why I always recommend using Anchorage as a base.\n\nI love staying at the Wildbirch Hotel downtown, grabbing breakfast at Biscuit Club next door, or having pizza at Moose's Tooth before heading out on adventures.\n\nPlus, one of my favorite scenic drives of all time is just south of Anchorage along Turnagain Arm. I recommend stopping in Girdwood to stretch your legs and grab a beer at Girdwood Brewing.\n\nFrom Anchorage, I've also taken glacier tours out of Whittier, driven out to explore the charming village of Hope, and gone on trips to Katmai and Lake Clark National Parks.\n\nBetween the wildlife, glaciers, and endless landscapes, it's a place that never stops amazing me.\n\nAs someone who's visited all 50 states, coastal Maine will always be on my short list for the most beautiful places in the US.\n\nI love starting my trip in the quaint town of Kennebunkport, visiting the iconic Portland Head Light in Cape Elizabeth, and then making the drive to hike in Acadia National Park.\n\nIf you have time, I recommend following the coast up to Lubec, the easternmost point in the continental US, for a taste of why this rugged, timeless coastline is so unforgettable.",

    "fullText": "JERUSALEM, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Nvidia (NVDA) is in advanced talks to buy Israel-based AI startup AI21 Labs for as much as $3 ​billion, the Calcalist financial daily reported on Tuesday.\n\nNvidia declined to ‌comment, while AI21 was not immediately available to comment.\n\nA 2023 funding round valued AI21 at $1.4 ‌billion. Nvidia and Alphabet's Google participated in that funding.\n\nAI21, founded in 2017 by Amnon Shashua and two others, is among a clutch of AI startups that have benefited from a boom in artificial intelligence, attracting strong ⁠interest from venture capital ‌firms and other investors.\n\nShashua is also the founder and CEO of Mobileye, a developer of self-driving car technologies.\n\nCalcalist ‍said AI21 has long been up for sale and talks with Nvidia have advanced significantly in recent weeks. It noted that Nvidia's primary interest in AI21 ​appears to be its workforce of roughly 200 employees, most of ‌whom hold advanced academic degrees and \"possess rare expertise in artificial intelligence development.\"\n\nCalcalist said the deal to buy AI21 is estimated at between $2 billion and $3 billion.\n\nNvidia, which has become the most valuable company in history at more than $4 trillion, is planning a large expansion in Israel with a ⁠new R&D campus of up to 10,000 ​employees in Kiryat Tivon, just south ​of the port city of Haifa - Israel's third-largest city.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang has described Israel as the company’s \"second home.\"\n\nNvidia has ‍said that when ⁠completed, the campus will include up to 160,000 square meters (1.7 million square feet) of office space, parks and common areas across ⁠90 dunams (22 acres), inspired by Nvidia's Santa Clara, California, headquarters. Nvidia expects construction to ‌begin in 2027, with initial occupancy planned for 2031.",

    "title": "Photos show how US presidents have redecorated the Oval Office through the years, from Taft to Trump",
    "description": "US presidents have each redecorated the Oval Office in their own unique ways since it was first built in 1909.",
    "fullText": "It's been nearly 100 years since the Oval Office was first built under President William Howard Taft. Throughout that time, US presidents have each made different design choices to redecorate the formal workspace.\n\nSome presidents, like President George H.W. Bush, have brought in their own furniture to replace the Resolute Desk. Others, like President Donald Trump, have reinstated vintage Oval Office pieces while adding their own personal flair.\n\nTake a look at how the Oval Office has changed through the years.\n\nInspired by the White House's oval-shaped Blue Room, the president's formal workspace was designed by architect Nathan C. Wyeth.\n\nTaft's Oval Office featured an olive-green color scheme.\n\nThe Oval Office was moved to the southeast corner of the White House.\n\nRoosevelt kept a variety of items on his desk, including photos of his sons, ceramic animal figurines, and an appointments easel with his daily schedule, according to the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum.\n\nTruman decorated the Oval Office with the turquoise rug and matching curtains. The walls were painted a lighter seafoam green.\n\nThe Resolute Desk, made of wood from the British ship H.M.S. Resolute, was gifted to President Rutherford B. Hayes by Queen Victoria in 1880. Previous presidents kept the desk in the second-floor office of the White House Residence and the Broadcast Room, according to the White House Historical Association.\n\nHe also redecorated the Oval Office with white drapes with red trim, evoking the American flag.\n\nNixon's Oval Office rug, in the same blue color as the American flag, was designed by first lady Pat Nixon.\n\nFord's decor included the wheel from the SS Mayaguez, an American container ship that was seized by Cambodian forces in 1975 and rescued at Ford's direction.\n\nThe clock, built between 1795 and 1805, has remained in the Oval Office under every subsequent president since 1975.\n\nOtherwise, he left most of Ford's decor.\n\nThe rug featured the presidential seal in the center with sunbeams emerging from the middle, surrounded by a border of olive branches.\n\nThe Resolute Desk was moved to the Residence Office.\n\nHockersmith designed the yellow curtains and the blue rug with the presidential seal. Clinton also chose to bring the Resolute Desk back to the Oval Office.\n\nThe rug featured a sunbeam design with the presidential seal at its center, reminiscent of Reagan's rug, and a lone star in a nod to Bush's home state of Texas.\n\nThe quote on the border of the rug read, \"The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.''\n\nHe also brought back Clinton's gold curtains and chose a new off-white wallpaper.\n\nBiden hung portraits of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Thomas Jefferson, and Alexander Hamilton.\n\nMany of the gold decor pieces in Trump's Oval Office came from the White House collection, but Trump also imported some statuettes from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nTrump also added flags representing different branches of the US military and additional presidential portraits, with President George Washington in the prominent center spot above the fireplace mantle.",

    "title": "I spent a year interviewing America's oldest workers. Here are their 5 tips for staying healthy and active.",
    "description": "I spoke to nearly 200 workers in their 80s and 90s this year. Here are their 5 biggest tips for living a fulfilling and long life.",
    "fullText": "This year, I spoke to nearly 200 Americans 80 and older who still work. Their advice for living into their 80s and 90s often wasn't going to the gym religiously or maintaining a strict diet.\n\nWhile most of those still working considered themselves \"healthy,\" only a handful devoted hours each week to strenuous exercise beyond walking. The secret to a long and healthy life, they said, was mental stimulation, having a strong social network, and finding ways to feel young. While a few said that working was a detriment to their quality of life, most said they felt working may have added a few extra years to their lives, even if they had no choice but to work.\n\nDozens of researchers on aging and work shared similar thoughts, emphasizing that purpose and drive were the attitudes that kept older workers engaged and thriving. Below are five of the most common tips older Americans had for living fulfilling lives.\n\nMany of America's oldest workers said that they strive not to look or feel \"old\" — in the words of 101-year-old author Jack Weber, \"Don't let the old man in.\"\n\nMany workers said they would try to cover up their age however they could. Some women said they would try to dress younger or dye their hair, while some men said they would try to stay involved with physical labor at their construction sites or manufacturing facilities. Some expressed hesitation at first in telling me their age in case their coworkers, who thought they were much younger, would see the article.\n\nSome workers said they tried to interact more with their younger colleagues, which helped them feel, in some cases, half their age. A few said they tried to learn the newest slang terms, while others learned AI fundamentals to feel relevant and \"hip.\" A handful said they felt they could learn much more from colleagues a quarter their age than from their older peers.\n\nAdopting this mindset helped some workers develop longer-term goals, strive to continually improve themselves, and overlook the physical and mental hardships that come with aging.\n\n\"I feel much younger than I am,\" said Patricia Casey, 80, who works as a librarian and media manager for a high school in Colorado. \"For my 80th birthday, I took two girlfriends, and we went to Las Vegas, and I thought, this is going to be great. Then two weeks ago, I took another girlfriend to Cuba for four days. I don't spend too much money, but I'm able to enjoy things.\"\n\nMany of the workers I interviewed had retired and then returned to work, and most said they disliked how unproductive their lives felt. Some got up whenever they felt like it, while others would only schedule one or two things in a day and struggle to fill the rest of the hours.\n\nDozens of workers said they cherished having responsibilities and places to be on a regular basis. Some woke up as early as 4 a.m. to get to work, which didn't bother them as much as they had expected. Many struggled to find time to fit in an interview with me because of how jam-packed their days were with work, recurring social events, and fitness commitments.\n\n\"When you get older, sometimes there's a tendency to get up, turn on the TV, and stay there,\" said Eileen Hartigan, 87, who works as an administrator for a medical school in Virginia. \"I needed to get back into the routine of getting up, showering, getting dressed, and getting ready to do something.\"\n\nOf course, some workers who had to stay employed for financial reasons wished they could have more flexibility in their day for medical appointments or relaxation. Still, these workers overwhelmingly agreed that having packed days kept them alert and active.\n\nAs substitute teacher David Hugo Barrett, 82, put it, \"Aging isn't something that can be taken lightly.\"\n\nWhile many of these workers aimed for aging to be as fulfilling as possible, nearly all had dealt with a hardship over the past few years, whether it be the loss of a spouse or friend, a major diagnosis, a financial mishap, or a job loss. Many expected the pain to be par for the course.\n\nEvery worker had at least something that kept them positive. For some, work was their main motivator, while others felt they had to keep making their families proud. Many refused to have a single regret, opting to focus on the future instead of lingering on the past. Some beat themselves up over financial decisions that made them have to work, but most of them found something in their lives that inspired them to give life their all.\n\n\"Some months are good and some months are not so good right now, but I have a lot of things in the queue,\" said Marilyn Gettinger, 83, who works as an instructor of supply chain management in New Jersey. \"At least until I'm 85, I'm going to work as much as I can.\"\n\nThe word \"purpose\" came up in a majority of interviews for my series. Many older workers wanted to contribute meaningfully to their community, regardless of whether they needed the money. Beyond having a reason to get up each morning, many said they strove to see an impact, such as seeing a smile on a client's face, a new home built, or a positive book review on Amazon.\n\nSome said they had too many life stories and pieces of advice to stay silent. Many have taken on mentorship roles at work, teaching younger generations about topics such as scientific research, business strategies, or driving an 18-wheeler. Others found work in teaching, college admissions, or music education to pass on their skill sets. Another common theme was older workers wanting to help their less fortunate aging peers struggling with financial instability or health challenges.\n\nA surprising number said they've seen their friends retire and die within a few months, suspecting they lacked motivation to keep going.\n\n\"People tend to look at older people as throwaways instead of tapping them for knowledge and experience, instead replacing them with a younger person,\" said Bob Haller, 83, who works as a motor coach operator in Nebraska. \"There are some older people that shouldn't be out operating heavy machinery, but I also think there are a lot of older people who get put out the pasture when they really don't need to be put out the pasture.\"\n\nWhile many of these workers said they had few friends or family members, nearly all stressed the importance of having at least a small group of people in their lives. Having close contacts allowed many to feel less lonely and more supported, ultimately leading to healthier outcomes, as research consistently shows a correlation between social interactions and cognitive health.\n\nMany found community through their workplaces. Some said they viewed their colleagues as their closest friends, while others valued the intergenerational connections they made with people their grandchildren's ages. Going to work each day didn't feel like a chore when they knew the day would be filled with conversation, they said.\n\nDozens of workers said they put in the work to keep their social lives flourishing. They treated friendships like a job, scheduling weekly golf sessions, tennis games, or poker nights much like a work meeting.\n\nOthers fortunate enough to have large families said they looked forward to seeing their grandchildren grow. Some decided to move closer to their children to have the social network they desired after the loss of a spouse.\n\n\"I have made so many friends through the years and seen a lot of 69 years, though I've seen a lot of my friends pass on,\" said Bill Smith, 86, who owns a café in Texas.",

    "description": "After skiing and snowboarding for decades and teaching my kids the winter sports, I have great tips for first-time beginners hitting the slopes.",
    "fullText": "I've been skiing and snowboarding my whole life, and I've even taught my children how to tackle the slopes.\n\nEvery so often, while riding the chairlift, I look down upon some out-of-control skier in soaked-through jeans, a snow-flecked sweatshirt, and cotton gloves. A few moments later, they crash into some obstacle and tangle themselves among their skis and poles.\n\nIt reminds me that although these sports can be fun winter activities, if you're not properly dressed or prepared, you're putting yourself and others at risk.\n\nWhether you're a beginner or a seasoned pro, here are a few tips for staying safe on the mountain.\n\nSlope safety begins at home. Before you leave, consider your outfit.\n\nYou'll definitely want waterproof snow pants and a jacket that will keep the wind and rain off of you, but your layers don't have to be anything fancy.\n\nTo start, you may be able to cobble together something warm from what you already own. Try wool sweaters, synthetic running shirts, and that random fleece vest that you own but never wear.\n\nI think it's pointless for a new skier to drop hundreds of dollars on gear, but there are a few body parts worth investing in (hands, feet, head). If you're going to spend money on anything, invest in good gloves.\n\nBeyond that, ski socks are priceless in keeping toes warm. A good neck gaiter and a basic pair of goggles can prevent your nose and eyes from dripping icicles, too.\n\nWhen picking out your gear, keep in mind that anything made of cotton has no place on the mountain.\n\nWhen cotton gets wet — an inevitability for first-time skiers and snowboarders who spend a lot of time on the ground or anyone who's prone to sweating — the material absorbs the moisture, remains wet, and makes you cold.\n\nChoose synthetic materials or natural fibers like wool that help to wick away water from the body and keep you warm.\n\nWhether you're renting or investing in your first pair of ski or snowboard boots, know that they should be snug.\n\nThe boots are meant to react to your feet's movements, so they have to be a little tight. However, they shouldn't be cutting off your circulation.\n\nIf they're uncomfortable in the rental shop, they're going to feel terrible on the mountain.\n\nDo yourself a favor and make sure they feel as close to perfect as possible before you hit the chairlift. The employees in ski shops should be able to help.\n\nOnce you arrive at the mountain, don't look to tackle anything above your level.\n\nIf you're a beginner, head straight for the bunny slopes. There's no shame in learning to turn, stop, and not kill yourself or someone else on the mountain's gentlest run.\n\nThe fastest way to get off the bunny hill is to take a one-hour lesson to help you acquire the basic skills to become a more competent rider.\n\nAfter you gain the fundamentals, progress in order. Conquering the bunny hill doesn't mean you're ready for black diamonds.\n\nHead to green-circle beginner trails to practice your turns and technique. After getting comfortable with those skills on that terrain, try the blue-square intermediate trails.\n\nPro tip: Keep in mind that trail markings are not universal from mountain to mountain. A black diamond in the Poconos usually isn't as difficult as a black diamond in Colorado.\n\nWe're heading into 2026 and not the aughts — a time when people didn't seem to truly understand that speed, hard surfaces, and bare skulls made for dangerous combinations on the slopes.\n\nWhether you're a beginner or a pro, you'll want a helmet. You can usually rent these if needed.\n\nTaking an in-person lesson is the best way to really get the hang of skiing, but here are a few tips and stances to get you started.\n\nFirst-time skiers need to remember two foods: pizza and french fries.\n\nKeep a gentle bend in your knees and shape your skis like a slice of pizza to achieve a more controlled stance, then proceed down the mountain at a reduced speed. Thinner pizza slices make you go faster, and wider ones slow you down.\n\nWhen you're ready to go faster, shaping your skis more parallel, like french fries, will send you straight down.\n\nSnowboarders have fewer food terms to remember, but you'll want to loosely bend your knees and carve back and forth across the mountain to limit your speed.\n\nThe trickiest part of snowboarding is shifting from your heel to your toe to change directions.\n\nMy best advice is to start slow, commit to every turn, and look where you want to go (not backward).\n\nThis story was originally published on December 3, 2024, and most recently updated on December 30, 2025.",

    "description": "I realized my kids stopped wanting my advice, and the shift hurt — but it also taught me how to let them grow and trust the adults they're becoming.",
    "fullText": "Just about every day, someone asks me for advice. Often it's a question about parenting, something I have been practicing for decades as the mother of five.\n\nFriends, colleagues, and mothers at the beginning of their parenting journey want to know how I dealt with a myriad of concerns, everything from toilet training to sex education. I'm always more than willing to share, and I often do, even when it's unsolicited.\n\nBut there's one group I hesitate to advise, my own children. Unless they ask for it, I do not offer any guidance.\n\nIt's not that I don't give good advice. I do. I'm actually pretty thoughtful with my suggestions. I always present them with sensitivity, making sure what I say is age and situation-appropriate. The problem is I don't always wait to be asked. I tend to dive right in.\n\nThat doesn't work with my kids, which became abundantly clear on their first Christmas home after a semester at college.\n\nAfter three months of living independently, my three oldest sons returned home for our first adult version of the holiday celebration. We hung their childhood ornaments on the tree and prepared our traditional menu of favorite foods, but once the gifts were unwrapped, I saw how they were changing.\n\nEach one had found their voice and was maturing into a unique individual. They'd come home with new assessments on life. Rather than engage in nostalgic reminiscences, they wanted to express their opinions on their broadening worldviews. Nothing Mom could say would be as valuable as what they were discovering.\n\nThese newly minted adults were actually living up to an expectation I'd set for them based on my personal definition of parenting — taking a totally dependent being and making them independent.\n\nMy first visit home from college was not that different. I remember how impassioned I was as I explained to my mother the newfound philosophy my dormmates and I were forging in late-night gab sessions. I doubt I was committed to what I was espousing, but I was fervent in my argument, and nothing my mother might say would dissuade me from my beliefs.\n\nI live for the moments when my kids do seek my advice.\n\nMost often, it relates to health, especially as they age and develop the ailments common to all our family members. Sometimes it's about work, like when my oldest asked what he should charge for an hourly rate. Occasionally, one might ask about money, like how to pay off their college loans. Rarely is it about love and relationships. When one son was madly infatuated with a girl who wouldn't give him the time of day, he pressed me for ideas about how to pursue her. I had none and recommended he seek love elsewhere, which he eventually did.\n\nIronically, my one son, who's a dad, rarely asks me about how to raise his kids. They're doing a great job thanks to all they're learning through Instagram and TikTok, pretty effective tools I never had.\n\nJust because they're uninterested in my advice does not mean the flow of information has ceased. Today, I'm suggesting the books to read or the latest Netflix series to watch, and they're the ones advising me. I look to them for wisdom on where to invest my money. It's me who wants to know what kind of car to buy. Of course, I ask them about all things tech, but also what exercise regime to follow, and even what professional opportunities to pursue.\n\nTheir life experiences are now informing my decisions. It's a full circle moment that keeps us growing in wisdom and knowledge we can then share with others who might ask.",

    "fullText": "California is the US state with the most people moving out, with about 817,000 leavers between 2021 and 2022, according to the most recent census data.\n\nA higher cost of living plus the increased threat of wildfires have people choosing other places across the country.\n\nAnd while regular people ditch the Golden State, several celebrities, who can typically afford to live wherever they want, have also decided California is no longer the place for them.\n\nSinger turned talk show host Kelly Clarkson traded Los Angeles for New York City post-divorce for in 2022, while actor Sylvester Stallone said in 2024 that he and his family are \"permanently\" vacating California for South Florida.\n\nPopular moving destinations for Californians include Arizona, Florida, and Texas. And some have chosen different countries completely.\n\nPeople have told Business Insider that their reasons for leaving LA and California include high taxes, expensive home prices, and challenging social and political conditions. Some celebrities remain tight-lipped when sharing details of their moves, simply saying they're looking for a fresh start. Other high-profile actors, however, admit that the fast-paced, stressful scene in Hollywood can be another motivation.\n\nLos Angeles, in particular, is experiencing an exodus of wealthier people in search of places where their money goes further.\n\nTake Gus Lira, a managing partner at a private jet charter company, who had a condo in Malibu overlooking the ocean. California taxes were wearing him down, so he decided to move to Nevada.\n\n\"For me, really the main reason, and for many of the people that I know, is just taxes,\" Lira told Business Insider in January. \"You can't get ahead when you get $100 and they take $60.\"\n\nBusiness Insider compiled a list of 25 celebrities — some in celebrity couples — who left California for greener pastures, presented in alphabetical order by last name. We tried to include both where they moved to and why they left LA.\n\nThe power couple has dealt with the paparazzi for most of their professional careers. But they had enough of their kids also having to endure it.\n\nSince 2018, Biel, Timberlake, and their two kids have lived predominantly at their properties in Tennessee and Montana.\n\n\"You get hammered on the East Coast. You kind of get hammered on the West Coast. That's why we don't really live there anymore,\" said Biel in a May 2024 episode of SiriusXM's \"Let's Talk Off Camera With Kelly Ripa,\" seemingly referring to her former home of LA. \"We're just trying to create some normalcy for these kids.\"\n\nDean Cain, best known for playing Clark Kent/Superman in \"Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman,\" was fed up with how things were run in California.\n\nThe actor split for Vegas in 2023.\n\n\"It's the most ridiculous large government, incredible taxation, horrible regulations for business,\" he told Fox News Digital in 2023. \"Very anti-business.\"\n\nCain said California's personal income tax felt especially high.\n\n\"I moved to Las Vegas. I live in Nevada now,\" he added. \"I have 10 times as nice a house. I'm not kidding. Ten times as nice a house as I had in Malibu. The house is absolutely stunningly built. Gorgeous, beautiful. Everything is brand new.\"\n\nKelly Clarkson felt she had a new lease on life when she moved to New York City last year.\n\nAfter finalizing her divorce from ex-husband Brandon Blackstock in 2022, she didn't just take her kids east. She also brought \"The Kelly Clarkson Show\" — it started taping in New York in season 5.\n\n\"I was very depressed for the last three years — and maybe a little before that, if I'm being honest. I think I really needed the change,\" the Grammy winner told People. \"I needed it for me and my family as well. My kids are thriving here. We're just doing so much better, and we needed a fresh start.\"\n\nThe Clooneys have lived the quieter life in Italy and France for years, but always had a home in LA, an English-style estate that George bought from Stevie Nicks back in 1995.\n\nThey finally sold that house in 2024 and now spend most of their time at their farmhouse in France with their twins, Ella and Alexander.\n\nGeorge told Esquire in 2025 why they left. \"I was worried about raising our kids in L.A., in the culture of Hollywood,\" he said. \"I felt like they were never going to get a fair shake at life.\"\n\n\"I don't want them to be walking around worried about paparazzi,\" he added. \"I don't want them being compared to somebody else's famous kids.\"\n\nIn late December 2025, George and Amal became French citizens.\n\nActor and director Jesse Eisenberg took the pandemic as an opportunity to leave Los Angeles. Eisenberg, his wife, and their son packed up an RV and drove to his wife's hometown of Bloomington, Indiana.\n\n\"We have driven cross-country a lot, but we thought it would be prudent to isolate in an RV instead of stopping at hotels,\" Eisenberg told The Hollywood Reporter in 2020.\n\nInitially, Eisenberg moved to Indiana to help take care of his late mother-in-law after she got sick and also help out at a domestic violence shelter where she worked.\n\nBut Eisenberg was happy to be in Indiana.\n\n\"I've lived in Indiana for a decade on-and-off and that's where I feel the most comfortable,\" Eisenberg told CBS News in February. \"I'm not somebody who wants to surround myself in an industry that just feels kind of unstable.\"\n\nSilverscreen superhero and Massachusetts native Chris Evans listed his Los Angeles home in May for $6.99 million, The Wall Street Journal reported, cementing his abandonment of California.\n\n\"After over a decade of amazing memories in his LA home, Chris is planning to move to the East Coast to be closer to family,\" Evans' listing agent Scott Moore said in a statement to People.\n\nEvans married his wife, Alba Baptista, in Cape Cod, and now they both spend most of their time in Massachusetts.\n\n\"The White Lotus\" star Walton Goggins and his wife, Nadia Conners, moved to New York's Hudson Valley during the pandemic in 2021. But, he told Architectural Digest in February, the move was less about California, and more about New York.\n\n\"We weren't running away from Los Angeles,\" he said. \"We were running toward something.\"\n\n\"The pandemic opened windows of self-perception and possibility,\" he added. \"It was an opportunity to do something different, not to start over from scratch but to change, to evolve.\"\n\nGoggins, who was raised in Georgia, chose to live in a 1920s home upstate that resembles a hunting lodge — with an abundance of wood paneling and wood flooring — instead of the glitzy surroundings of Los Angeles.\n\nJohn Goodman figured out a long time ago that Los Angeles wasn't for him and has been living in New Orleans since the late 1980s.\n\nLike many, the Emmy winner first visited Crescent City to party. In the late 1970s, he showed up with his fraternity pals. A few years later, as an actor, he was shooting the movie \"Everybody's All-American\" alongside Dennis Quaid, Jessica Lange, and Timothy Hutton when he met his future wife, Anna Beth. He's been attached to the city ever since.\n\n\"I used to come down here every time I'd get a few dimes to rub together, and it felt like I was missing something unless I was here,\" he told \"Today\" in 2023. \"I consider myself very lucky to be here.\"\n\nAdrian Grenier, known mostly from his \"Entourage\" fame, left California for Texas in 2020.\n\nGrenier traded the glitzy life of Hollywood for a farm 45 minutes outside Austin, Texas, where he prefers a quieter lifestyle outside the spotlight.\n\n\"I don't miss anything about that world. Listen, if you go on Instagram long enough, you're going to find some FOMO somewhere, but everyone is just pretending they're living their best life,\" he told Life Magazine in 2021. \"Ultimately, I know that I am, so I don't even tell anybody about it.\"\n\nThe actor recently gained renewed attention thanks to movies like \"Oppenheimer\" and \"Trap,\" but don't expect to find him hanging out on the Sunset Strip. Since the pandemic, he's ditched LA for the English countryside.\n\nHartnett and his wife, British actor Tamsin Egerton, have lived in Hampshire since COVID hit, bringing up their four kids. He's living in the UK on a marriage visa, so he can only leave the country for work for around 180 days a year.\n\nAfter spending his early career in the Hollywood spotlight, Hartnett told The Guardian he loves the village country life where \"nobody cares\" who you are.\n\n\"This is all brand new to me,\" he said. \"I never would have expected it. And time passes quickly. With four children, you have so much to do. In a way, less is happening. But more of the important stuff is happening.\"\n\nBeing outside Hollywood is also safer for Hartnett. He told The Guardian that when he lived in LA, he had experiences with stalkers.\n\n\"People showed up at my house. People that were stalking me,\" he said. \"A guy showed up at one of my premieres with a gun, claiming to be my father. He ended up in prison. There were lots of things. It was a weird time. And I wasn't going to be grist for the mill.\"\n\nA year after Nicole Kidman tied the knot with country-music star Keith Urban, the two got the heck out of LA.\n\nIn 2007, they moved to Nashville, where the Australian Oscar winner dove headfirst into Urban's world.\n\n\"That country-music community is a very warm community,\" she told People in 2016. \"It's very protective. Keith's been a part of it for decades now. It's his home, it's our home.\"\n\nIn September, Kidman filed for divorce from Urban.\n\nLohan has lived on both coasts, but she currently prefers to be in the United Arab Emirates, where she lives with her husband, financier Bader Shammas, and their two-year-old son.\n\nIn a May 2025 profile in Elle, Lohan said that when she was living in Los Angeles, she would be \"stressed\" about the paparazzi taking photos of her while at the park with her son. Living in New York, there's a \"different kind of energy\" but not as much space. Living in Dubai, she gets it all.\n\n\"I get the privacy, I get the peace, I get the space,\" she said. \"I don't have to worry there; I feel safe.\"\n\nThe star and producer made the decision a few years ago to move out of Los Angeles.\n\nShe now splits her time between Mexico and Spain. She told Marie Claire in 2024 that she left Hollywood behind because it felt like that \"chapter in my life is done now.\"\n\nWhile on \"Live with Kelly and Mark\" in April, Longoria said she loves traveling to the Andalucía region of Spain to enjoy the small beach bars and restaurants.\n\nA few years before the McConaissance led to Matthew McConaughey's best actor Oscar win, he and his wife, Camila Alves, fled Hollywood for his home state of Texas.\n\nThe two settled in Austin in 2012 after buying a 10,800-square-foot mansion. According to a profile in Southern Living, it was initially because of a \"family crisis,\" as he needed to help his mother and two brothers. That led to the couple deciding to stay put to raise their three children there.\n\n\"Ritual came back,\" McConaughey said of being back in Texas. \"Whether that was Sunday church, sports, dinner together as a family every night, or staying up after that telling stories in the kitchen, sitting at the island pouring drinks and nibbling while retelling them all in different ways than we told them before.\"\n\nAfter 21 years on the grind in LA, Metz packed up and left town when the pandemic hit. She now resides in Nashville.\n\n\"There's a lot going on,\" \"The Hunting Wives\" star told People in April 2025. \"There's obviously great music, great food. I grew up in the South, so I'm used to sort of that hospitality — it feels more communal here. In LA it was always like, 'Oh, you have an audition? What's it for? Oh, you have an audition? What for?' It was all very dog eat dog!\"\n\nGlen Powell left Los Angeles and returned to his home state of Texas in 2024.\n\nPowell, who had a breakout role in \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" has lived in Los Angeles for more than 15 years, but told The Hollywood Reporter in 2024 that he's done enough in Hollywood and he feels he can now live elsewhere. \"It's like I've earned the ability to go back to my family,\" he said.\n\nNot only does living in Texas allow Powell to be closer to family, but he's also finishing his degree at the University of Texas.\n\n\"I think this is going to be good for my head, heart, and soul,\" he said.\n\nWhen you know, you know. After less than a year of dating, Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively packed up their stuff and left Hollywood for the suburbs of New York City.\n\nIn 2012, after six months of dating, the couple bought a $2.3 million home in Pound Ridge, New York.\n\n\"We don't live in LA. We live on a farm in New York,\" said the \"Deadpool\" star in a 2015 interview. \"And we don't lead a wild and crazy life. It's not that hard. It's not a big deal.\"\n\nThe Oscar winner realized many years ago that Los Angeles wasn't for her.\n\nRoberts moved to a 32-acre ranch in Taos, New Mexico, in 1995.\n\nThe \"Pretty Woman\" star told Oprah back in 2003 that in New Mexico, everything is \"clear.\"\n\n\"Around here, I come and go like it's nothing,\" she said. \"Los Angeles is such a town of show business, and I'm a terrible celebrity. I find it difficult — it's the beast that must be fed.\"\n\nWith movies like \"Mean Girls\" and \"Mamma Mia!\" in her filmography, you would think Amanda Seyfried would want to lay her head down somewhere glamorous.\n\nBut she actually prefers life on a farm.\n\nSeyfried spends most of her time on a farm in the Catskills, a mountain range north of New York City, that she purchased in 2014, Architectural Digest reported in 2023.\n\n\"It's insane how much I can feel so accomplished and successful here without having to be in a successful movie,\" she told The New York Times in 2020.\n\nAfter decades of living in Los Angeles — including in his first dingy apartment on Balboa Boulevard, which would become the inspiration for his iconic character Rocky Balboa — Sylvester Stallone packed up and left town in 2023.\n\nThis was first revealed in early 2024, during season two of his reality series \"The Family Stallone\".\n\n\"After a long, hard consideration, your mother and I have decided, time to move on and leave the state of California permanently, and we're going to go to Florida,\" Stallone said. \"We're going to sell this house.\"\n\nStallone and his wife, Jennifer Flavin, gave multiple reasons for the relocation, including the desire for a fresh start after their children moved out of the family home.\n\nThe legendary rocker decided that at 79 years old, it was time to stop traveling across the pond.\n\nIn 2023, he put his sprawling 38,500-square-foot Beverly Hills property, which he has lived in since 1975, on the market.\n\nSelling the home is bittersweet for Stewart: \"I don't want to sell it, and the kids don't want me to sell it either,\" he told People in 2023. \"There's too many fond memories. I've lived [in LA] since 1975, and I adore the place.\"\n\nBut he said he's making England a more permanent home since wrapping up his latest world tour and Las Vegas residency.\n\n\"Modern Family\" star Eric Stonestreet did not mince words when he explained why he's been living in Kansas City since the acclaimed show ended after 11 seasons in 2020.\n\nIn a September 2024 interview with long-form interview journalist Graham Bensinger, he said a big reason he left LA was to get away from all the fake people in Hollywood.\n\n\"What I realized it does is it highlights everything great about our business, the entertainment business,\" the actor said on what it's like to no longer live in LA. \"And it highlights all the douchebaggery of our business. It amplifies it. Because I'm here, I'm dealing with people from here, and I'm going into the store and having all these authentic, real moments, and then I go to Hollywood, and you're reminded of some of the types of people that you deal with.\"\n\nThe Oscar winner is loving her new life in the mountains of Telluride, Colorado, on 168 acres with five rescue dogs.\n\nShe and her husband, Philip Schneider, bought the land in 2016, broke ground in 2018, and finally completed the home in 2020.\n\nA year later, she put her LA home on the market and has been living it up in the great outdoors.\n\n\"I have been looking for land since I was in my mid-20s,\" Swank told Architectural Digest in 2022. \"I find nature to be my happiest place, and animals are my other happiest place. And to be with both of them is everything to me.\"\n\nIn 2020, James Van Der Beek and his wife, Kimberly, renewed their wedding vows for their 10th anniversary in Austin, Texas.\n\nA year later, they moved their six kids from LA to Austin, where they now live on a 36-acre property.\n\n\"We wanted to get the kids out of Los Angeles,\" Van Der Beek told Austin Lifestyle in 2021. \"We wanted to give them space and we wanted them to live in nature.\"\n\nBoston-born Mark Wahlberg set out to LA years ago to make it as an actor. Over his career, he realized he rarely stayed there to make any of his movies. So, in 2022, he packed up and moved his family to Las Vegas.\n\nHe told The Talk in October 2022 that in Nevada his four kids can more easily pursue their hobbies, including golfing, riding horses, and playing basketball.\n\n\"We came here to just kind of give ourselves a new look, a fresh start for the kids, and there's a lot of opportunity here,\" Wahlberg told The Talk. \"I'm really excited about the future.\"",

    "description": "In 2025, we saw plenty of fashion missteps at major red-carpet events, from the Oscars and the Met Gala to the Cannes Film Festival.",
    "fullText": "We need to talk about the red-carpet duds of 2025.\n\nSure, there were many standout fashion moments throughout the year, like Zendaya at the Golden Globes. Still, there were just as many fashion mistakes made at major events.\n\nJamie Lee Curtis, for example, pushed feathers to their limit at the SAG Awards, and Alexander Skarsgård wore a truly ridiculous pair of boots in Cannes. Then, Kim Kardashian went incognito at the Academy Museum Gala.\n\nSadly, they're not alone. Here's a look at those outfits and other style moments that disappointed in 2025.\n\nShe walked the Golden Globes red carpet on January 5 in a hot-pink jumpsuit with long sleeves. It also had a V-shaped neckline, a thick waist panel, and wide-leg pants. The actor sported a massive ruffled cape on top.\n\nMcCarthy was overwhelmed by the Christian Siriano look. A simpler gown in a lighter shade of pink would have suited her much better.\n\nUnfortunately, she was one of the stars who missed the mark with her fashion at the February 23 event. Her feathered top was so thick that it covered her entire neck and created an unflattering silhouette.\n\nHer Dolce & Gabbana dress was much better, with a form-fitting shape and all-over sparkles. Still, the outerwear distracted from her gown.\n\nThe musician walked the Oscars red carpet on March 2 in a custom Ralph Lauren ball gown. Though it had some potential, its various features ultimately clashed and created a messy look.\n\nIts sparkling, strapless top would have suited a prom dress, while its full skirt with a raw hem looked messy and incomplete. Her brown belt also looked much more casual than her layered diamond necklaces.\n\nHis black catsuit featured floor-length trousers, a loose-fitting top that covered half his torso, and a neckline that extended into a scarf wrapped around the bottom of his face.\n\nThe outfit fit him poorly, looked a bit odd, and landed him on the night's worst-dressed list.\n\nLatex had a moment in the late 2010s, but it's long passed. So it was confusing to see Lively in a tan-colored dress made from the stretchy material at the premiere of \"Another Simple Favor.\"\n\nThe Renée Masoomian garment was strapless with a structured bodice and a lace-embellished skirt. It also featured a latex overcoat that Lively wore at the start of her appearance.\n\nShe arrived at the Breakthrough Prize ceremony in a sequinned Gaurav Gupta gown.\n\nThough the color and sparkling material suited the musician, its shape and accessories did not.\n\nThe visible mesh that held its bodice together distracted from its unique shape, and its matching headpiece appeared too tight to fit Perry comfortably.\n\nFor the Time 100 Gala on April 24, Sheeran sported a Tom Ford suit that was tailored perfectly.\n\nBut its pale-pink color washed him out, and the white T-shirt he wore beneath his blazer was too bland. A darker fabric could have improved his suit, especially if paired with a button-down top.\n\nShe attended the event on May 8 in a black one-piece from Monse. The sleeveless garment had a leather bodice and wide-leg trousers with an asymmetrical skirt draped on top.\n\nThe outfit was cool, but it wasn't accessorized to its full potential. It would've been fun to see Kidman wear it with an updo hairstyle, smoky eye makeup, and a bit of silver jewelry.\n\nWitzøe might've been one of the few billionaires at the 2025 Met Gala, but he was also one of the worst-dressed.\n\nThe Norwegian billionaire wore a white suit from Todd Patrick, an overcoat seemingly made from latex, multiple necklaces, a wide-brimmed hat, and Tabi boots.\n\nHe also carried a see-through briefcase filled with vibrant red roses, which made the outfit look more like a costume.\n\nSaint Laurent custom-made her black blazer dress, which she wore with sheer tights and diamond jewelry.\n\nThe glamour of those accessories clashed strongly with her edgy choice of shoes: a pair of platform open-toed heels.\n\nOverall, though, the outfit was too plain and didn't match the night's theme, which honored Black dandyism and menswear.\n\nHe was photographed on the Cannes red carpet wearing a Saint Laurent tux and his trousers tucked into thigh-high leather boots.\n\nThe fashion house first unveiled the shoe style during its January runway show, where the design looked somewhat interesting. On a red carpet, though, they mostly looked ridiculous.\n\nThe Blonds designed her royal blue ensemble, which was strapless and covered in silver sparkles. It had a structured bodice, a sharp neckline, and long pants with flame-like fringe at the ankles.\n\nThe top half of the outfit had potential and would have worked if paired with a miniskirt. As a catsuit, though, the outfit looked more like a costume.\n\nShe walked the event's red carpet in a shapeless, colorless gown from Prada. It had a high neckline, long sleeves, and a flowing skirt that revealed her silver platform sandals.\n\nThe outfit was forgettable and could have been improved with silver jewelry and an updo hairstyle.\n\nShe wore a beige jumpsuit that was covered in transparent sequins and embellished with cutouts. It had a scarf neckline, one off-the-shoulder sleeve, and skinny pants.\n\nUnfortunately, the garment wasn't tight enough to be form-fitting, nor loose enough to fit oversized. Its neutral color was also too light to make a statement.\n\nSimone Rocha designed her eye-catching set, which featured wide-legged trousers worn beneath a sleeveless, sparkling gown.\n\nThe top half of her outfit would have looked chic if worn on its own. But when paired with pants, the style overpowered the actor.\n\nShe wore a tan look from Maison Margiela, which was just a touch lighter in shade than her skintone, and a stack of diamond and emerald necklaces wrapped around her neck.\n\nThe strapless gown, with its arm bands and light ruching, looked elegant on the billionaire. However, she also wore a tan hood that covered her face, which looked more silly than serious.\n\nShe wore a long-sleeved, V-neck gown from Gucci in a striking green color. It was covered in sequins and contrasted her dark hair beautifully.\n\nHowever, her accessories didn't work with the dress. She carried a small black purse and wore a statement necklace made from rubies and diamonds.\n\nThe two pieces clashed and distracted from the elegant gown.\n\nThe country star hosted the annual event, making numerous outfit changes throughout the night.\n\nOne of those included a long-sleeved, camouflage dress with a floor-length skirt, a long brown belt, leather gloves, and a cowboy hat.\n\nThe outfit's country vibes were strong, but it fell short of glamorous and was definitely not her best look during the CMA Awards.",

    "title": "Beyoncé's net worth has reached the billions. See how the superstar makes and spends her fortune.",
    "description": "Beyoncé's net worth is $540 million. Here's how the Houston native became a multi-million dollar superstar, and what she spends her fortune on.",
    "fullText": "In 2022, Beyoncé sang, \"It should cost a billion to look this good.\" Three years later, the \"Pure/Honey\" lyric proved prophetic when Beyoncé joined an exclusive group of billionaire musicians.\n\nCombined with Jay-Z's business empire, the Knowles-Carter family's net worth now stands at roughly $3.5 billion, according to Forbes' estimates.\n\nHere's a rundown of how Beyoncé has built her fortune over the course of several decades — and the glamorous ways she spends her money.\n\nBeyoncé was born in 1981 in Houston. Her father, Matthew Knowles, was a sales executive with Xerox, and her mother, Tina Knowles-Lawson, owned a hair salon.\n\nAt the age of 9, Beyoncé became a cofounding member of Destiny's Child, originally known as Girl's Tyme. Despite initial setbacks, including a loss on the TV show \"Star Search,\" the group was signed to Columbia Records in 1997.\n\nBeyoncé and her bandmates went on to release four No. 1 singles in the US and sell over 50 million albums worldwide. In 2005, one year before they officially disbanded, the World Music Awards honored Destiny's Child as the best-selling female group of all time.\n\nBeyoncé's debut solo single, \"Crazy In Love,\" reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. Her debut album, \"Dangerously In Love,\" followed suit on the Billboard 200.\n\nSince going solo, Beyoncé has released eight No. 1 albums and nine No. 1 hit songs. She has the most Grammy Awards of any artist in history and the most certifications from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) among female artists. Her collection of over 100 certified titles includes two diamond singles, \"Halo\" and \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring On It).\"\n\nBeyoncé may be this century's most celebrated pop star, but she's also an entrepreneur.\n\nIn 2010, she launched Parkwood Entertainment, which she's referred to as a \"multipurpose badass conglomerate.\" It's run by a team that includes former executives from Apple, J.P. Morgan Chase, and Nokia.\n\nIn December 2025, Forbes named Beyoncé a billionaire, citing her valuable musical catalog, touring revenue, and in-house management structure.\n\nBeyoncé's 2016 album, \"Lemonade,\" debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and received unanimously positive reviews.\n\nLater that year, Beyoncé embarked on the Formation World Tour. The all-stadium trek grossed about $256 million, per Billboard, helping her become the top-earning musician of 2016.\n\nThe following year, Beyoncé was named the highest-paid woman in music by Forbes.\n\nBeyoncé was paid millions to headline Coachella in 2018 (although it's unclear how much of that went toward staging the groundbreaking performance).\n\nShe cashed in again when Netflix acquired the rights to the concert film \"Homecoming\" as part of a three-project deal reportedly worth $60 million.\n\nBeyoncé and Jay-Z also wrapped up their On the Run II Tour in October 2018, which grossed over $250 million, per Billboard.\n\nBeyoncé's acclaimed 2022 album, \"Renaissance,\" became Spotify's most-streamed album by a female artist upon release. It has since been certified 2x platinum by the RIAA, meaning it has sold over 2 million copies.\n\nThat might sound like a standard amount of success for a star of Beyoncé's stature, but it was the stadium tour that turned \"Renaissance\" into a massively lucrative era. The 2023 Renaissance World Tour, produced by Beyoncé's own Parkwood Entertainment, grossed an estimated $579 million.\n\nLater that year, the \"Renaissance\" concert film arrived in theaters. Beyoncé's deal with AMC allowed her to pocket nearly half of the $44 million global box office gross.\n\nAMC's CEO, Adam Aron, said that \"literally all\" of the company's revenue growth in Q4 of 2023 was thanks to Beyoncé and Taylor Swift, who released her own concert film around the same time.\n\nBeyoncé followed \"Renaissance\" with \"Cowboy Carter\" in 2024, a country-inspired album that served as a response to gatekeepers in Nashville. Like its predecessor, the album debuted at No. 1, spawned a No. 1 hit song, and received rave reviews from critics.\n\nLater that year, Beyoncé and the NFL teamed up to leverage the album's success, staging a special Christmas Day halftime show that was livestreamed on Netflix. Beyoncé made an estimated $50 million from the one-off performance, including production costs.\n\nIn 2025, Beyoncé embarked on the Cowboy Carter Tour, which reportedly grossed more than $400 million in ticket sales and an additional $50 million in merchandise sales, according to Forbes' estimates.\n\nBeyoncé's big-screen breakout role came in 2002, when she played Foxxy Cleopatra in \"Austin Powers in Goldmember.\" The comedy was the seventh-highest-grossing film of the year.\n\nShe reportedly earned $12.5 million for her role in the 2006 film \"Dreamgirls,\" not counting additional earnings from the soundtrack.\n\nHer company, Parkwood Entertainment, has produced films including \"Cadillac Records\" in 2008 and \"Obsessed\" in 2009. The latter, which starred Beyoncé opposite Idris Elba, grossed $74 million at the box office against a $20 million budget.\n\nMore recently, Beyoncé voiced Nala in Disney's live-action remake of \"The Lion King\" in 2019. She was reportedly paid $25 million for her role in the film, which went on to gross over $1 billion at the box office. She also helmed the film's soundtrack, \"The Lion King: The Gift.\"\n\nIn 2022, Beyoncé earned her first Oscar nomination for \"Be Alive,\" an original song from the biographical sports drama, \"King Richard.\"\n\nBeyoncé reportedly held a \"significant\" stake in Jay-Z's music streaming service, Tidal, which was sold for about $300 million in May 2021 to Jack Dorsey. She retained her stake and secured an $8.9 million payout, Variety reported.\n\nIn 2022, Beyoncé invested in Lemon Perfect, a startup that has raised $42.2 million and is now valued at more than $100 million.\n\nIvy Park, Beyoncé's sports apparel brand, was first launched in collaboration with Topshop in 2016 before switching to Adidas in 2020. According to Fortune, Adidas paid Beyoncé about $20 million a year for the partnership.\n\nAlthough Ivy Park was discontinued in 2024, Beyoncé has continued to expand her business empire with a hair-care brand, Cécred, and a whiskey label, SirDavis.\n\nBeyoncé is known for her impressive work ethic, but that doesn't mean she doesn't know how to relax.\n\nBeyoncé and Jay-Z have been known to vacation in Brazil, Italy, and Ibiza. They often visit the Dominican Republic, where they stay in a $19.5 million, 35,000-square-foot estate.\n\nWhen Beyoncé was pregnant with twins Rumi and Sir, she reportedly rented a villa in Malibu for $500,000 a month. The property sold for $50 million in 2018.\n\nBeyoncé can also retreat to the private island in the Bahamas, purchased by Jay-Z for $4 million.\n\nThe Carter-Knowles family has spent vacations on the Galactica Star, a $73 million luxury yacht reportedly owned by Nigerian energy magnate Kola Aluko.\n\nTo stay on this exclusive yacht, you need to know the owner, but it will still cost a reported $900,000 a week.\n\nA penthouse suite in the Hotel Le Meurice in Paris is another favored European getaway for the couple, which goes for $20,000 a night.\n\nBeyoncé and Jay-Z purchased a Malibu home for $200 million in 2023. Just steps away from the ocean, it's the most expensive home ever sold in California and the second-most expensive property deal in US history.\n\nThat's in addition to a whole portfolio of properties, including an $88 million Bel-Air mansion in Los Angeles, the $4.45 million converted church in the Garden District of New Orleans, a Tribeca penthouse apartment, and a $26 million, seven-bedroom mansion in the Hamptons.\n\nBeyoncé is said to own a $2 million 2010 Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport and a custom $1 million Mercedes van with its own washroom and $150,000 sound system.\n\nIt has been reported that she and Jay-Z purchased a one-of-a-kind Boat Tail Rolls-Royce for $20 million, complete with a \"Blue Ivy\" leather interior and a refrigerator holding Armand de Brignac Champagne.\n\nAdditionally, The Telegraph reported that Beyoncé bought Jay-Z a $40 million Bombardier Challenger 850 private jet as a Father's Day gift.\n\nBeyoncé and her family are regulars at NBA games, where the average cost of a courtside ticket is about $2,000, according to Sportskeeda.\n\nShe and Jay-Z have been spotted at Le Cirque, one of New York's most exclusive restaurants, and in 2013, they reportedly spent almost $100,000 on drinks for VIP guests at an Atlanta nightclub.\n\nAt home, Beyoncé is said to employ a live-in chef who earns $7,500 a month and a dietician who earns $4,000 a month. However, while on the Renaissance tour, she hired a vegan chef and three personal chefs for herself and her inner circle, according to The New York Times.\n\nFor her first birthday, Beyoncé's eldest daughter, Blue Ivy, was reportedly given an $80,000 diamond-encrusted Barbie doll, in addition to a $100,000 birthday party and a $600,000 gold rocking horse.\n\nAll three children of Beyoncé's children have been decked out in designer clothes. Blue Ivy has been spotted wearing a dress by designer Mischka Aoki, which is worth more than $8,000.\n\nIn 2013, Beyoncé launched the BeyGood initiative. It has since evolved into a public charity foundation, dedicated to supporting students, local business owners, and victims of natural disasters with personal grants and direct aid. In 2020, BeyGood announced a $6 million relief initiative for essential workers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "fullText": "Gold's amber-colored cousin is quietly moving through the ranks.\n\nCopper, an element seen as central to the AI data center buildout, is on track to post its best year since the Great Financial Crisis.\n\nThe metal's 3-month price on the London Metals Exchange hovered around $12,222 per metric ton on Tuesday, down slightly from a record high of $12,960 per metric ton on Monday. That puts copper up 42% from levels at the start of the year, marking its best year-to-date gains since 2009.\n\nAs of Tuesday, the metal notched its eighth straight day of wins, its longest winning streak in eight years, according to an analysis from top economist David Rosenberg.\n\nFor copper — an industrial that's taken the backseat to precious metals in recent years — there are a few things that explain its blistering rally:\n\nCopper's winning year has largely been fueled by \"relentless supply-deficit concerns,\" Rosenberg wrote in a recent note to clients.\n\nCopper also looks to be partly influenced by a great year for metals all around. Gold, in particular, is up 64% from the start of the year, and tends to take metals like silver and copper up along with it, Art Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management, told Business Insider.\n\n\"When the group starts to move, they all move together,\" he said of broader rally in precious metals.\n\nWall Street doesn't think that momentum will die out anytime soon.\n\nAnalysts on JPMorgan's market intelligence team said they expected copper prices to climb to around $12,500 per metric ton in the first half of next year, thanks to tailwinds like AI demand and tariffs being potentially rolled back.\n\nGoldman Sachs said it expected copper to hit $15,000 per metric ton over the next decade, implying 22% upside from the metal's current levels.\n\n\"Copper remains our favorite long-run industrial metal because it faces unique supply constraints and structurally strong demand growth,\" the bank wrote in a client note.",

    "fullText": "US and Syrian forces killed or captured nearly 25 ISIS fighters in late December in the wake of massive airstrikes against the terror group, the American military said on Tuesday.\n\nUS Central Command, which oversees Middle East operations, said its forces carried out 11 missions against the Islamic State with partner forces in Syria from December 20 to 29, killing and capturing some two dozen fighters and destroying four weapons caches.\n\nThe US has been ramping up its operations against ISIS after a gunman killed two American soldiers and a civilian interpreter and wounded three soldiers in Syria on December 13. President Donald Trump vowed retaliation in the aftermath.\n\nImmediately following that ambush, US and partner forces carried out 10 operations in Syria and Iraq that left 23 Islamic State fighters dead or detained, according to Centcom.\n\nOn December 19, US officials announced the start of \"Operation Hawkeye Strike.\" American forces, supported by the Jordanian military, bombed more than 70 ISIS targets across Syria with over 100 precision munitions launched from fighter jets, attack helicopters, and artillery pieces.\n\nSpecifically, the US assets involved in those strikes included F-15E fighter jets, AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, KC-135 Stratotanker refueling aircraft, and M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launchers.\n\nThe US military said that the airstrikes pummeled ISIS infrastructure and weapons sites. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth wrote in a social media post that \"lots\" of fighters were killed and more would be hunted down.\n\n\"This is not the beginning of a war — it is a declaration of vengeance,\" he said on December 19.\n\nThe US military has been present in Syria for over a decade, routinely working with partner forces to fight ISIS since 2014. While the exact numbers have shifted over the years, there are roughly 900 American troops posted at various bases throughout the country.\n\nThis past year, the Islamic State inspired at least 11 terror plots or attacks against targets in the US, Centcom said, reporting on Tuesday that American and Syrian partner forces have killed or captured more than 320 fighters in counterterrorism operations over the past 12 months.\n\nAdm. Brad Cooper, the Centcom commander, said in a statement on Tuesday that the US remains committed to working with partners to curb the threat posed by ISIS.\n\n\"Continuing to hunt down terrorist operatives, eliminate ISIS networks, and work with partners to prevent an ISIS resurgence makes America, the region, and the world safer,\" he said.",

Officials said the average award for 2026 is $200 million, and the fund puts a total of $50 billion into rural health programs over five years.

    "fullText": "States will share $10 billion for rural health care next year in a program that aims to offset the Trump administration's massive budget cuts to rural hospitals, federal officials announced Monday.\n\nBut while every state applied for money from the Rural Health Transformation Program, it won't be distributed equally. And critics worry that the funding might be pulled back if a state's policies don't match up with the administration's.\n\nOfficials said the average award for 2026 is $200 million, and the fund puts a total of $50 billion into rural health programs over five years. States propose how to spend their awards, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services assigns project officers to support each state, said agency administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz.\n\n“This fund was crafted as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill, signed only six months ago now into law, in order to push states to be creative,\" Oz said in a call with reporters Monday.\n\nUnder the program, half of the money is equally distributed to each state. The other half is allocated based on a formula developed by CMS that considered rural population size, the financial health of a state’s medical facilities and health outcomes for a state’s population.\n\nThe formula also ties $12 billion of the five-year funding to whether states are implementing health policies prioritized by the Trump administration's “Make America Healthy Again” initiative. Examples include requiring nutrition education for health care providers, having schools participate in the Presidential Fitness Test or banning the use of SNAP benefits for so-called junk foods, Oz said.\n\nSeveral Republican-led states — including Arkansas, Iowa, Louisiana, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Texas — have already adopted rules banning the purchase of foods like candy and soda with SNAP benefits.\n\nThe money that the states get will be recalculated annually, Oz said, allowing the administration to “claw back” funds if, for example, state leaders don't pass promised policies. Oz said the clawbacks are not punishments, but leverage governors can use to push policies by pointing to the potential loss of millions.\n\n“I've already heard governors express that sentiment that this is not a threat, that this is actually an empowering element of the One Big Beautiful Bill,\" he said.\n\nCarrie Cochran-McClain, chief policy officer with the National Rural Health Association, said she’s heard from a number of Democratic-led states that refused to include such restrictions on SNAP benefits even though it could hurt their chance to get more money from the fund.\n\n“It’s not where their state leadership is,” she said.\n\nExperts say fund is inadequate in face of other cuts\n\nOz and other federal officials have touted the program as a 50% increase in Medicaid investments in rural health care. Rep. Don Bacon, a Republican from Nebraska who has been critical of many of the administration’s policies but voted for the budget bill that slashed Medicaid, pointed to the fund when recently questioned about how the cuts would hurt rural hospitals.\n\n“That’s why we added a $50 billion rural hospital fund, to help any hospital that’s struggling,” Bacon said. “This money is meant to keep hospitals afloat.”\n\nBut experts say it won't nearly offset the losses that struggling rural hospitals will face from the federal spending law's $1.2 trillion cut from the federal budget over the next decade, primarily from Medicaid. Millions of people are also expected to lose Medicaid benefits.\n\nEstimates suggest rural hospitals could lose around $137 billion over the next decade because of the budget measure. As many as 300 rural hospitals were at risk for closure because of the GOP’s spending package, according to an analysis by The Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\n“When you put that up against the $50 billion for the Rural Health Transformation Fund, you know — that math does not add up,” Cochran-McClain said.\n\nShe also said there's no guarantee that the funding will go to rural hospitals in need. For example, she noted, one state’s application included a proposal for healthier, locally sourced school lunch options in rural areas.\n\nAnd even though innovation is a goal of the program, Cochran-McClain said it's tough for rural hospitals to innovate when they were struggling to break even before Congress’ Medicaid cuts.\n\n“We talk to rural providers every day that say, ‘I would really love to do x, y, z, but I’m concerned about, you know, meeting payroll at the end of the month,’” she said. “So when you’re in that kind of crisis mode, it is, I would argue, almost impossible to do true innovation.”\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "fullText": "Fox News co-host Jessica Tarlov expressed skepticism over a single YouTuber managing to uncover more than “$100 million worth of fraud on his own” in Minnesota, Monday.\n\n“It’s going to get incredibly complicated for him,” said Tarlov on The Five about Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) during a discussion about the massive amounts of fraud recently uncovered in Walz’s state. “Obviously, he’s been considering 2028. I think that that will be more difficult when something like this has gone on in your state while you were in office, even if you were not personally involved in.”\n\nReacting to YouTuber Nick Shirley’s recent viral video, which alleged that several Minnesota child care centers were empty and being used to fraudulently funnel $110 million from the state, Tarlov said:\n\nNick Shirley’s reporting, there’s no way that this kid walking around uncovered $100 million worth of fraud on his own. There have been tons of people working behind the scenes quietly, including independent local journalists that have been exposing this. I don’t know about the veracity of every single thing that he’s gone and seen – that’s being debated online – but obviously there’s a huge problem here.\n\nIt does Democrats no favors to get partisan about this and to dig in and say, “Oh it absolutely couldn’t be happening because it’s my team that this happened to.” That argument that it has not been covered is ludicrous. People don’t want to just do simple Google searches. The biggest story about this came from the New York Times and it made liberals look terrible […] It wasn’t published in a far-right publication, it was published in the Times.\n\nAfter his video on the child care centers went viral last week, Shirley called for Walz to be held accountable for widespread fraud in his state.\n\n“Tim Walz and the fraudsters aren’t escaping this one. In one day my crew and I uncovered over $110,000,000 in fraud, this is just the tip of the iceberg,” wrote Shirley. “We the people simply work too hard and pay too much in taxes to allow this to happen, they must be held accountable.”\n\nHouse Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN) also demanded answers over the video, writing, “4 million dollars of hard earned tax dollars going to and an education center that can’t even spell learning correctly. Care to explain this one, @tim_walz?”\n\nThe post Fox’s Jessica Tarlov Says There’s ‘No Way’ a YouTuber Uncovered More Than $100 Million of Fraud in Minnesota ‘On His Own’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "The CEO of cybersecurity company Cato Networks may have just validated the fears of many: that the dot-com era could be repeating itself.\n\n\"We are in a bubble,\" Shlomo Kramer, who runs the company aimed at securing organizations' digital and AI transformation, told Business Insider.\n\nKramer said the bubble is fueled by both the high level of investment and early profit gains from AI, which he said are encouraging companies to keep investing fast enough to hold market prices up, despite what he described as a growing disconnect between valuations and reality.\n\n\"There's a dislocation there; it's big and it's going to unwind,\" Kramer said.\n\nThe CEO said that while he \"absolutely\" believes in AI and its capabilities, the question remains about whether the investments are matching the rate of that return.\n\n\"It's going to happen at a much slower pace than right now,\" Kramer said, about the advancements of AI.\n\nThe CEO said if he could assess AI in every department of an organization that he knows, the takeaway would be: \"not yet.\" For example, Kramer said that AI can bring value in areas like customer support, but it can't replace it. It may be able to replace the first level of support, but that isn't where companies face the highest cost, he said.\n\n\"It's simply not there yet,\" Kramer said.\n\nThe CEO similarly said that he sees AI boosting engineering capabilities down the line, but for now, its impact is \"modest.\" He said AI may be able to increase effectiveness and productivity to them in specific areas or situations, but it can't replace engineers.\n\nKramer said he's not seeing companies cutting back on engineers or firing them because of AI — even if they've claimed that's what they're doing.\n\n\"I highly suspect that all these companies that said that they are firing engineers because they now have AI actually used AI as a cover story,\" Kramer said.\n\nWhile there has been some indication that entry-level engineering roles are on the decline, many companies have continued to hire engineers amid the AI boom, and some firms, like Cloudflare, have expanded their internship programs.\n\nKramer is the latest CEO to weigh in on the debate about an AI bubble. While the current investment landscape shares some similarities to that of the dot-com era, some execs think that we're in a different situation today because AI has shown more of an impact in the past few years.\n\nIndustry leaders are split on the topic. The CEO of Nvidia, the chipmaker that's fueling the AI revolution, has denied the existence of an AI bubble, while Mark Zuckerberg has said the bigger risk is not spending enough.\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI's Sam Altman, who led the AI takeoff with the launch of ChatGPT, and frequently champions the technology, has said investors are \"overexcited about AI.\"\n\nEven with a solid ChatGPT prompt, there's no crystal ball to know exactly how this will end.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has described \"tariff\" as the \"most beautiful word in the English language.\" Economist Stephen Moore doesn't quite agree.\n\nMoore served as one of Trump's chief economic advisors during his first presidency, working with the administration on many tax and energy policies, including the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017. He famously called for Trump to receive a Nobel Peace Prize in 2018, citing, the president's record on economic policies.\n\nBut more recently, Moore has espoused a different perspective.\n\nHe recently discussed his take on Trump's economic agenda for both the past and coming years. While he praised the president's trade deals, he noted that the more recent tariff record tends to worry him.\n\nIn a CNBC appearance, Moore laid out how he feels regarding the past year's economic policies and their impact, highlighting both the positive and negative impacts posed by Trump's trade strategy.\n\n\"I like the way he's been able to negotiate better deals for the US,\" Moore noted, \"but it does worry me with tariffs because tariffs do have a negative impact on the economy.\"\n\nHe acknowledged that the tariffs have helped the US reach trade agreements with nations such as China and Japan but noted that he believes Trump may have overestimated the power of his economic policies when he promised to bring $18 trillion into the US through capital investments.\n\nMoore cited the previous year's economic forecasts that predicted 1% GDP growth. Since then, the US economy has far surpassed such estimates, posting 4.3% growth for the most recent quarter, although the data was delayed for months due to the US government shutdown.\n\n\"Part of the reason that economists were so negative on the economy was tariffs,\" Moore added, noting that he is not a fan of tariffs, despite his longstanding support for the Trump administration's policies and history of praising them.\n\nIn addition, Moore noted that he thinks the White House estimate that the US can achieve at least 5% GDP growth in the coming year isn't realistic. He added, though, that while he sees 4% as high, he thinks the US should strive to be between the 3-4% range, citing concerns about the debt curve.\n\nOften referred to as a yield curve, this economic phenomenon is impacted by tariffs, which can impact expectations regarding both growth and inflation. Moore highlighted the importance of making sure the economy is growing faster than its debt.\n\n\"If you get the economic growth rate over 3%,\" he said, \"You start turning the debt curve that we're all concerned about, the national debt and the deficits we're running. That's the main thing.\"",

    "description": "OpenAI alum Andrej Karpathy wrote on X that his failure to fully claim the 10x boost of new tools felt like a \"skill issue.\"",
    "fullText": "Andrej Karpathy has long been ahead.\n\nHe was ahead of the AI boom, having worked as a founding member of OpenAI in 2015, long before competitors like Anthropic and xAI emerged. He also got into self-driving vehicles early, steering Tesla's autopilot effort as its head of AI.\n\nNow, he says, \"I've never felt this much behind as a programmer.\"\n\nIn an X post on Friday, Karpathy wrote that the industry was being \"dramatically refactored,\" as individual programmers contribute fewer and fewer lines of code.\n\n\"I have a sense that I could be 10X more powerful if I just properly string together what has become available over the last ~year,\" he wrote. \"A failure to claim the boost feels decidedly like skill issue.\"\n\nI've never felt this much behind as a programmer. The profession is being dramatically refactored as the bits contributed by the programmer are increasingly sparse and between. I have a sense that I could be 10X more powerful if I just properly string together what has become…\n\nAI has radically transformed the software engineering industry, introducing code editors like Cursor, Claude Code, and Codex, along with a slew of agentic software development tools. Business Insider's Amanda Hoover called 2025 \"the year coding changed forever.\"\n\nKarpathy was a key player in the change. In February, he coined the term \"vibe coding.\" To vibe code, one prompts AI to generate lines of code. (It gets its name because developers \"fully give in to the vibes,\" Karpathy wrote in his original post.) The Collins Dictionary named it the word of the year.\n\nStill, Karpathy wrote that it's like a \"powerful alien tool\" was handed out without a manual.\n\n\"Everyone has to figure out how to hold it and operate it, while the resulting magnitude 9 earthquake is rocking the profession,\" he wrote.\n\nIn the comments, another one of the biggest names in vibe-coding agreed. Boris Cherny created Claude Code for Anthropic, now one of the most popular AI tools among developers.\n\nCherny wrote that he felt that way \"most weeks,\" and that he sometimes finds himself approaching a problem manually, not yet realizing AI can do it faster.\n\nNew graduates and early career coders may fare best in this new environment, Cherny wrote, because they don't assume what AI can and cannot do.\n\n\"It takes significant mental work to re-adjust to what the model can do every month or two, as models continue to become better and better at coding and engineering,\" he wrote.\n\nResponding to Cherny, Karpathy wrote that he had similar experiences. He analogized the new tools to a weapon, one that sometimes \"shoots pellets\" or \"misfires\" — highlighting the work-in-progress nature of AI.\n\nOther times, though, the tools work wonders.\n\n\"Once in a while when you hold it just right a powerful beam of laser erupts and melts your problem,\" he wrote.",

    "title": "3 reasons buying Manus could give Meta a much-needed AI boost",
    "description": "Meta is seen as lagging  behind OpenAI and Google in the AI race. Its acquisition of Singapore-based AI startup Manus could help with that.",
    "fullText": "AI dealmaking isn't slowing down — and it's Meta's turn again.\n\nThe social media giant is buying Manus, a Singapore-based artificial intelligence startup, the companies announced on Monday.\n\nManus went viral in March when it previewed an AI agent that could autonomously perform tasks like screening résumés and stock analysis. Manus was created in China but relocated to Singapore in mid-2025. Meta paid more than $2 billion for Manus, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nThe deal is the latest in a flurry of red-hot AI investment and acquisitions this year, which includes Meta's $14 billion investment in Scale AI in June. From providing an instant AI revenue source to giving it a leg up in AI agents, here's why buying Manus could give Meta a much-needed boost in the AI race.\n\nManus said in December that it had processed more than 147 trillion tokens of text and said its users were in the \"millions.\" It also claimed to have crossed $100 million in annual recurring revenue, achieving both milestones eight months after launch.\n\nThose numbers tell us Meta is getting a startup with a built-in audience of paying users. Meta's business model to date has largely revolved around building free products and making money from collecting user data and targeted advertising. Manus offers a free tier for basic tasks, but charges users up to $200 a month for its pro tier.\n\n\"The purchase gives Meta a functioning business with paying customers, meaningful revenue and infrastructure already proven at scale,\" said Murthy Grandhi, company profiles analyst at research firm GlobalData, in a note.\n\nIn its announcement, Meta said it plans to continue selling the Manus service separately while also integrating Manus's technology into its existing platforms, which include Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Meta did not elaborate on which ones or how it might do so. Meta has poured billions into building up its internal AI teams and developing what is termed \"superintelligence,\" with so far little in terms of returns. Manus could be a way for Meta to start making money directly from AI while it continues to build out its internal efforts.\n\nMeta has struggled to wow consumers and developers as much as OpenAI and Google when it comes to raw model power. However, as these models become increasingly commoditized, there is a growing need to show AI can actually be useful. One such way is AI agents, a type of software that can proactively make decisions and take actions, such as creating a marketing campaign or monitoring and fixing bugs in apps.\n\nBuying Manus could prove a smart bet on the idea that the real value will lie in the programs that sit on top of the models. Manus primarily uses other companies' AI models, like Anthropic's Claude, as building blocks and layers its own software on top.\n\n\"People keep assuming a small update from OpenAI or Google will wipe out a lot of AI startups,\" wrote Yuchen Jin, CEO of the AI startup Hyperbolic, in an X post about Meta's Manus deal. \"But in reality, the AI application layer should be where most of the opportunity is.\"\n\nA Meta spokesperson did not immediately respond to a question about which models Manus would support following the acquisition.\n\nOne of Meta's strengths is that its platforms are used by billions of people, which, like Google, gives it a distribution advantage. Its challenge is to find ways to keep them coming back.\n\nUnlike Google with Gemini 3, Meta has yet to have a buzzy AI breakthrough moment with its own in-house models. Combining Manus's \"general-purpose agents\" with Meta's distribution channels gives the social media company another shot at that, particularly as CEO Mark Zuckerberg has acknowledged that Facebook has shifted from being a place for friends to view each other's content to a \"broad discovery and entertainment space.\"\n\n\"Manus offers a ready-made, high-margin software layer that can be sold directly and integrated across Meta's consumer and enterprise products,\" said GlobalData's Grandhi.",

    "fullText": "MIAMI (AP) — U.S. Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick reiterated her innocence Monday outside a Miami federal courthouse, where she faces charges of conspiring to steal $5 million in federal COVID-19 disaster funds.\n\nCherfilus-McCormick was scheduled to be arraigned, but her attorney requested the proceeding be rescheduled to Jan. 20 so that she could finalize her legal team. Prosecutors didn't object, and Judge Lisette Reid agreed to the new date. The hearing lasted less than five minutes.\n\n“I just want to make it very clear that I am innocent,” Cherfilus-McCormick said immediately after leaving court. “In no way did I steal any kind of funds. I'm committed to the people of Florida and my district.”\n\nCherfilus-McCormick, a Democrat, has pleaded not guilty. She is facing 15 federal counts that accuse her of stealing funds that had been overpaid to her family's health care company, Trinity Healthcare Services, in 2021. The company had a contract to register people for COVID-19 vaccinations.\n\nCherfilus-McCormick's attorney, David Oscar Markus, said the case involves mistakes that generally aren't even misdemeanors, let alone felonies. He said he believes the case is politically motivated.\n\nCherfilus-McCormick was arrested in November and then freed on a $60,000 bond. In addition to bail, the judge said Cherfilus-McCormick must surrender her personal passport, and is allowed to travel only between Florida, Washington, D.C., Maryland and the Eastern District of Virginia.\n\nShe has been allowed to retain her congressional passport so she can perform certain duties for her job.\n\nAccording to the federal indictment, prosecutors said that within two months of receiving the funds in 2021, more than $100,000 had been spent on a 3-carat yellow diamond ring for the congresswoman.\n\nThe health care company owned by Cherfilus-McCormick's family had received payments through a COVID-19 vaccination staffing contract, the indictment said. Her brother, Edwin Cherfilus, requested $50,000, but they mistakenly received $5 million and didn't return the difference.\n\nProsecutors said the funds received by Trinity Healthcare were distributed to various accounts, including to friends and relatives who then donated to Cherfilus-McCormick's campaign for Congress.\n\nCherfilus-McCormick won a special election in January 2022 to represent Florida’s 20th District, which includes parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties, after Rep. Alcee Hastings died in 2021.\n\nThe charges she faces include theft of government funds; making and receiving straw donor contributions; aiding and assisting a false and fraudulent statement on a tax return; money laundering, as well as conspiracy charges associated with each of those counts.\n\nAccording to a previous statement provided by Cherfilus-McCormick's chief of staff, she doesn't plan to resign from office. She said she has cooperated with “every lawful request” and will continue to do so until the matter is resolved.",

Whilst the handle might confuse a 79-year-old president known to be a bit of a Luddite, the display name should be a red flag to him. It is ‘Fan Karoline Leavitt,’ although ‘Fan’ is rendered in stylized fonts and emojis in a bid to obscure that word. However, in an effort to stamp out fakes, X marks such accounts with a ‘parody’ badge, too.\n\nThe messaging from the account, which has 213,000 followers, gives major clues that it is not the actual Leavitt. In March, the brains behind the bizarre operation invited followers to rate the press secretary’s rear.\n\n“What do you think of my backside? Watch the video—it’s featured in the final 3 seconds. I am with President Trump and Mr. Musk,\" the poster wrote alongside a clip of Leavitt walking up an airplane steps with the aforementioned figures. Trump did not share a screenshot of this particular poll.\n\nA new feature recently introduced by X should also help the president realize the account isn’t even based in the U.S., but in Taiwan. The profile also only became verified in November 2024, when Trump was elected, and had a documented name change in February 2025, shortly after Trump returned to the White House.\n\nHowever, it is entirely possible that Trump knows the account is a phony and shares its posts anyway, because they fit the MAGA narrative. The account, which has over 213,000 followers, regularly posts the sort of anti-immigrant sentiment and election denial that Trump segues into during speaking events.\n\n“BREAKING: Fulton County admits 315K 2020 votes lacked required poll worker signatures—a major rule violation. Republicans demand restitution for Rudy Giuliani, hit with charges & $148M fine for contesting GA election. Do you support giving his money back?\" it posted last week, based on a report about the 2020 Georgia election. Trump reshared a screenshot of the post.\n\nSimilarly, he shared a grab from a tweet the account made about Somali immigrants, demanding the deportation of all of them from Minnesota. He did this on Christmas Day.\n\nHe wasn’t drawn by a post, one of several, that indicated the poster was trying to suggest that they were indeed Leavitt. In one such ruse, they invited people to have tea with the president in the White House.\n\n“I am selecting 1,776 MAGA supporters from X for a free White House visit on July 4th, with a Trump photo op! If President Trump approved and all the expenses were covered, would you join?” it asked followers in June.\n\nSeparately, the poster invited “real human users” to a press conference headed up by Leavitt.\n\nThe White House has been asked by the Daily Beast whether Trump knows this is a spoof account.",

    "fullText": "\"The lady doth protest too much, methinks.\"\n\nSometimes the classics tell the story and, in this case, Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" applies.\n\nEarlier this month, TheStreet published an analysis of Saks Global's financial situation. It did not paint a pretty picture.\n\nRagini Bhalla, head of brand and spokesperson for Creditsafe, shared data on the struggles Saks Fifth Avenue has faced, which could push the company into a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.\n\nIt’s important to note that Bhalla used publicly available financial information to analyze the company. Saks itself has not issued a going concern warning or made any public comment on a potential Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.\n\n“Saks Inc.’s Days Beyond Terms (DBT) data over the past twelve months reveals a persistent and troubling pattern of late payments that point to sustained cash flow distress. DBT measures how many days late a company pays its bills. Throughout the entire year, Saks’ DBT has hovered well above the industry average of 10-12 days, ranging from a low of 27 in November 2024 to a high of 41 in January 2025 and March 2025,” she shared in an email to TheStreet.\n\nShe then explained the info in very clear terms.\n\n\"This indicates that Saks has consistently taken nearly a month or more to pay its suppliers late,\" she wrote.\n\nDespite the clarity of the information, which at least heavily suggested major financial concerns at Saks Global, the company denied that anything was wrong.\n\n“We are making strong progress to reduce outstanding payments, invest in our transformation and drive improved performance. It is important to note that a restructuring is not being contemplated. We have sufficient liquidity after raising $600 million in financing this summer from existing bondholders. At the same time, with inventory levels normalizing and the significant synergies from our integration, we expect performance to improve through the holiday season and into 2026,” the company shared in a statement sent to TheStreet.\n\nIn addition, the company spokesperson took significant issue with the idea that the company was in any danger of filing Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nThose denials of bankruptcy, not even being considered by the Saks Global board, now ring very hollow.\n\nA number of major news outlets have now reported that Saks Global Enterprises has very much put a Chapter 11 filing on the table.\n\nBloomberg:Saks Mulls Bankruptcy After Raising Billions for Turnaround\n\nPYMNTS:Saks Considers Chapter 11 Bankruptcy as $100M Debt Payment Comes Due\n\nBizJournals: Neiman Marcus parent reportedly considers bankruptcy",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE, Dec 30 (Reuters) - China is requiring chipmakers to use at least 50% domestically made equipment for adding new capacity, three people familiar with the matter said, as Beijing pushes to build a self-sufficient semiconductor supply chain.\n\nThe rule is not publicly documented, but chipmakers seeking state approval to build or expand their plants have been told ​by authorities in recent months that they must prove through procurement tenders that at least half their equipment will be Chinese-made, the people told Reuters.\n\nThe mandate is one of the most ‌significant measures Beijing has introduced to wean itself off reliance on foreign technology, a push that gathered pace after the U.S. tightened technology export restrictions in 2023, banning sales of advanced AI chips and semiconductor equipment to China.\n\nWhile those U.S. export restrictions blocked ‌the sale of some of the most advanced tools, the 50% rule is leading Chinese manufacturers to choose domestic suppliers even in areas where foreign equipment from the U.S., Japan, South Korea and Europe remain available.\n\nApplications failing the threshold are typically rejected, though authorities grant flexibility depending on supply constraints, the people said. The requirements are relaxed for advanced chip production lines, where domestically developed equipment is not yet fully available.\n\n\"Authorities prefer if it is much higher than 50%,\" one source told Reuters. \"Eventually they are aiming for the plants to use 100% domestic equipment.\"\n\nChina's industry ministry did not respond to a request for comment. The sources did not wish ⁠to be identified as the measure is not public.\n\nChina's President ‌Xi Jinping has been calling for a \"whole nation\" effort to build a fully self-sufficient domestic semiconductor supply chain that involves thousands of engineers and scientists at companies and research centers nationwide.\n\nThe effort is being made across the wide supply-chain spectrum. Reuters reported earlier this month that Chinese scientists are working on a prototype ‍of a machine capable of producing cutting-edge chips, an outcome that Washington has spent years trying to prevent.\n\n\"Before, domestic fabs like SMIC would prefer U.S. equipment and would not really give Chinese firms a chance,\" a former employee at local equipment maker Naura Technology said, referring to the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation.\n\n\"But that changed starting with the 2023 U.S export restrictions, when Chinese fabs had no choice but to work with domestic suppliers.\"",

    "description": "Ukraine uses robots to evacuate injured troops, but it can also make them into targets.",
    "fullText": "A ground robot evacuating a wounded Ukrainian soldier was attacked by a Russian drone.\n\nHis battalion said the robot was damaged, but the soldier was protected and had no new injuries.\n\nRobots are increasingly used by Ukraine but are also targets and can put hurt troops in more danger.\n\nNew video footage from Russia's war against Ukraine shows a ground robot transporting an injured Ukrainian soldier being hit by a Russian drone.\n\nUsing ground robots to rescue soldiers is just one way Ukraine is putting its growing fleet to work. The uncrewed vehicles also move supplies, lay and remove mines, and attack Russian targets. Employing bots for battlefield casualty evacuation helps keep medical crews out of harm's way, but it can also leave an injured soldier exposed and vulnerable to attack.\n\nUkraine's 1st Separate Medical Battalion shared the footage on Monday, revealing that the soldier was safely evacuated. The rescue robot took the hit and protected him. The soldier didn't sustain any additional injuries during the 3-hour and 25-minute mission.\n\nThe soldier had been injured by a drone drop and was unable to walk by himself. Reaching him meant navigating territory with a significant Russian presence, and the planned return journey was 36 miles.\n\nThey decided to send a robot controlled from afar by soldiers in safer positions, the battalion said. Ukraine uses robots to carry out missions too hazardous for humans.\n\nThe robot detected a Russian drone soon after the injured soldier was loaded on, the battalion said. The team decided to continue moving at maximum speed, but the drone hit the robot on its second attempt, two and a half miles into the journey.\n\nThe soldier did not suffer any new injuries from the attack, as he was contained in the robot's armored capsule. The robot, however, was damaged, the battalion said.\n\nHe was evacuated by another Ukrainian unit nearby and got the treatment he needed, it said. The robot was also recovered. Business Insider was unable to independently verify the details reported by the battalion.\n\nThe video shows a ground robot moving through a rural area at night, stopping as soldiers load an injured comrade aboard and close a protective lid. The robot then drives on, before aerial footage appears to show an explosion above it.\n\nThe video then shows the wounded soldier speaking after the mission, along with footage of the damaged robot. The battalion said his treatment is continuing.\n\nA host of companies are developing Ukraine's robot fleet, and innovation is rapid, with soldiers even updating them on the battlefield.\n\nHowever, they are risky, particularly if they lack cages like the one in this attack. Robots are targets for Russia's swarms of ever-present drones.\n\nOleksandr Yabchanka, the head of the robotic systems for Ukraine's Da Vinci Wolves Battalion, previously told Business Insider that using robots can sometimes put the soldier at greater risk, as it takes them from where they may have been able to hide or be with comrades out into the open.\n\nThey use humans for evacuations where possible, though that isn't without risks, and robots as a last resort.\n\nGround robots conduct less than 1% of Ukraine's drone missions; however, their use is growing. And the West is testing and prototyping uncrewed vehicle designs relying on what Ukraine is learning.",

    "description": "A total of four graves from two battles—which took place in 1745 and 1866—contained soldiers from different armies.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nA highway project in the Czech Republic unearthed mass graves filled with soldiers.\n\nA total of four graves from two battles—which took place in 1745 and 1866—contained soldiers from different armies.\n\nThe artifacts in the graves included muskets and corresponding musket balls, along with buttons, textile remnants, and fragments of uniforms.\n\nFour mass graves spanning two wars (in the 1700s and 1800s) were discovered in the Czech Republic, each filled with the remains of fallen soldiers and the projectiles that took their lives.\n\nAs road crews worked to route a future D11 Motorway, the Archaeological Center Olomouc uncovered four different mass graves containing the bodies of soldiers felled in conflicts more than a century apart. One grave dated back to 1745 (containing those killed in the Second Silesian War’s Battle of Zdar), while the other three were from the Battle of Novy Rokytnik (which occurred during the Austro-Prussian War of 1866).\n\nThe graves were discovered, according to a statement from the archaeological center, thanks to metal detector surveys picking up bullets in the ground. Archaeologist Michaela Bartos Dvorakova said that the team found round musket balls from the 18th century that correspond to flintlock muskets, while the more modern graves featured elongated bullets characteristic of 19th-century weapons.\n\nThe first find was a mass military grave related to the Battle of Zdar in 1745. Archaeologists discovered 12 skeletal remains, but Bartos Dvorakova said that the research team hasn’t yet been able to “determine which side the fallen belonged to.”\n\n“The grave lies within the historical battle line,” Matous Holas, an archaeologist from the Museum of Eastern Bohemia in Hradec Kralove, said in a statement. “The route of the future motorway practically follows it.”\n\nDuring the war, the Prussian army attacked the Austrian-Saxon forces manning the old imperial road. The conflict eventually ended in Prussian dominance.\n\nWithin the grave, alongside the 12 bodies, excavations uncovered buttons, textile remnants, fragments of uniforms, bullets, and personal equipment of the buried soldiers. The cause of death was obvious for some—several individuals died from gunshot wounds to the head.\n\nOf the three 1866-dated mass graves, two were filled with Prussian soldiers buried after the battle of Novy Rokytnik in 1866. One of the two graves contained seven soldiers, while the other had three. “We recovered more than 10 boxes of textile material from the Prussian graves,” said anthropologist Slawomir Antonik. “Buttons, parts of uniforms, fragments of weapons, and personal items such as a mirror or a pocket coffee grinder have survived.”\n\nJust over one mile away, archaeologists found yet another mass grave tied to the same battle, this one filled with Austrian soldiers. It was the largest find in terms of remains, containing 23 individuals. Bartos Dvorakova said that the remains were in such poor condition that identifying the number of deceased was largely done by counting boots attached to lower limbs.\n\nBut far more than remains filled the grave. “We found exceptionally well-preserved textiles and military items in the grave,” Bartos Dvorakova said, “such as parts of coats, equipment components, and personal belongings of fallen soldiers.” The most unique items was a silver pocket watch with a dog motif and a gold franc that had been minted in 1854.\n\nAlongside the bullets, the team found a fitting from a saber scabbard, likely owned by a non-commissioned officer of the Austrian army. “If additional equipment components are discovered, it is highly likely that a non-commissioned officer was among the dead,” Holas said. “Based on current information, the burials otherwise represent regular enlisted men.”\n\nThe Archaeological Center Olomouc will further examine the find, and the Museum of Eastern Bohemia hopes to identify the military materials and place them in historical context. Following analysis, plans call for reburying the soldiers’ remains.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "description": "Physical clutter is bad for your productivity—but so is its digital counterpart.",
    "fullText": "It’s well-established that physical clutter impairs your productivity and focus, going as far as to make you exhausted, stressed, and burnt out, which is why decluttering your workspace is key component in a lot of productivity techniques. In this day and age, though, your \"workspace\" isn't always (or, in some cases, even) an office or desk. Your phone and computer are your workspace. That's where you spend most of your work day looking and interacting—and when it's cluttered, you can feel discombobulated, the same as you might with a messy cubicle. It's time to stop thinking only about decluttering the physical world and make a better plan to keep the digital one in good shape.\n\nTake stock of your desktop, your tabs, your inbox, and your home screen: How many different windows do you have open right now? They are not only bogging down your mental energy, but your device’s energy, too. Let's fix that—and find a solution that sticks.\n\nAim to start each week with a digital decluttering. It doesn’t have to take more than 15 minutes, but you’ll be more productive when it’s done, so it’s a good investment of your time. Approaches like this work best when you actively take the time to schedule them out, so fall back on time boxing and time blocking, and consider using a specialized to-do list system like 3-3-3, then designating the weekly decluttering one of Monday's three small tasks.\n\nOn your desktop, create folders that can store whatever you need, whether those are documents for work or screenshots for your side business. Each Monday, go through whatever docs or pics have accumulated on the desktop and stick them in their respective folders so the whole thing looks cleaner. Do the same thing with any new apps you’ve put on your phone. There’s no reason to scroll through pages and pages of apps to find the one you need when you can stash it in a folder and keep your home screen organized. Only keep the necessary, daily-use folders available on your desktop and home screen. The rest should be banished somewhere invisible, but searchable.\n\nClose all open windows you’re not using—and all the tabs left over from your last browsing session. If you genuinely need something available, bookmark it. Get in the habit of closing tabs whenever you’re done with them. (Check for minimized browser windows, too; I always have at least two that need to be closed, but I rarely realize they're running in the background.)\n\nNext up is email. I've recommended the “one-touch” method of inbox management before, and an adaptation of it works great here: Open every email you’ve gotten in the last week and either delete it or archive it, depending on whether you anticipate needing it later. Anything you archive, be sure to set aside time to respond to later in the day or week. (Again, time box and time block this, plus add it to your to-do list so it's a real, scheduled task, not just a good idea you may or may not get around to.)\n\nPerhaps most importantly, delete as you go. This is the the one I struggle with most, but once you get in the habit, it's easy. If you downloaded an app for a single purpose and don’t use it anymore, delete it. If you have docs in your files from an old class or work project, delete them. Stick to doing this for the first 15 minutes every Monday (or whenever you start your week) to dramatically reduce your digital clutter and any related stress.",

    "description": "Beware the \"gift card draining\" scam.",
    "fullText": "If you received gift cards over the holidays, don't throw them in a drawer and forget about them. While many gift card scams involve thieves demanding payments—for everything from taxes and fines owed to outstanding utility bills—via prepaid cards, there's a less obvious type of fraud known as gift card draining.\n\nIf you forget how much money is on a gift card you received a while ago, you're likely to check the balance online. You'll typically need to enter your card number and PIN or security code, but some websites that claim to provide gift card balances are actually collecting that information to use it later. Always use the official site listed on the back of your card, or better yet, call or visit the retailer directly to confirm the balance.\n\nIn another version of this scam, fraudsters have set up sites offering to pay you for gift cards you don't want or won't use. They may claim to purchase your $100 card for $90—which sounds better than no money at all—but are simply out to steal the card information and drain the funds, and you'll never actually see that cash. Sites promoting that type of deal are typically not legitimate.\n\nWhen you purchase or receive a gift card, keep the receipt, note the starting balance, and register it with the retailer or transfer the funds from the gift card to your existing account if those options are available. If possible, change the PIN, and spend the funds sooner rather than later.\n\nIf you're considering buying physical gift cards in the future, be sure to check for signs of a scam. Fraudsters will tamper with cards in stores by adding stickers over the barcode, so when you check out, the funds you pay go to their account rather than the card itself, which means the balance will be zero when the recipient goes to spend it. Scammers can also record the card number and activation PIN or security code, then reseal the packaging and replace the card on the rack—once the card is paid for or activated, they use the information to spend the funds.\n\nInspect gift cards purchased in-store carefully for added stickers, damage to the packaging, or scratch-off coating that has been removed. You can avoid some risk by purchasing gift cards online directly from the merchant's website (as gift cards sold at steep discounts on social media or deal sites are often scams).\n\nAnd if you do end up with a scam card, you can file a report with the gift card issuer, though your mileage may vary in terms of recovering funds. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has a list of fraud contacts for some of the most popular card retailers, including American Express, Visa, and Amazon.",

    "description": "Don't worry too much about the difference—both are beneficial in similar ways.",
    "fullText": "There are benefits to training in heart rate zone 2, and you’ve probably heard all about them. But what happens when your heart rate spikes into zone 3, whether when you're on a run or doing cardio at the gym? Surprise: You don’t lose the benefits of zone 2 training. Zone 3 is arguably just as good for you, or maybe even better.\n\nRemember, the reason people are excited about zone 2 training is that it helps you build your aerobic base and burn calories without incurring much fatigue. Guess what zone 3 training also does? Yep, it helps you build your aerobic base, burn even more calories, and usually only incur a tiny bit more fatigue than zone 2. So why aren’t we all doing more zone 3 cardio?\n\nThere are reasons to run (or do any cardio) at lower intensities, and reasons to use higher intensities. Easy cardio is having a moment right now, so everybody is talking about doing more zone 2. Before heart rate monitors were widespread, you had to judge what was “easy” by yourself, or by comparing your speed of running to what you knew you could do in a race. Non-athletes had the “talk test\": If you could hold a conversation while jogging, you knew you were at an easy, steady pace.\n\nBut when everybody has a watch that tells them their heart rate, suddenly we’re looking at specific numbers, and our watches color code the numbers so you know when you’re in zone 2 versus zone 3. Your heart ticks up a beat? You’re out of your zone. Straight to workout jail!\n\nBut the reality is, your body isn’t getting a drastically different workout at 153 beats per minute than it was at 152. There probably isn’t even much difference between, say, 145 and 155, as long as they’re both within that conversational-ish effort level.\n\nThe most popular heart rate zone systems use zones that are divided up for convenient measuring. They don't have any precise relationship to what's going on in your body. Your body does have some true dividing lines when it comes to exercise intensity (like the point at which you can't speak comfortably anymore, or the point at which lactate accumulates faster than you can clear it), but these don't correspond exactly to the typical five-zone system.\n\nThe five-zone system, as a refresher, is based on where your heart rate falls as a percentage of your maximum heart rate. There will be specific percentages defined as the boundaries of each zone, and the five zones are usually described something like this:\n\nzone 2: easy breezy conversational pace\n\nzone 3: ??? (this is sometimes described as a \"gray zone\" you should avoid—I disagree!)\n\nIt's a cute idea, and many people find this system helpful, but these zones are not based on any scientific findings that prove we get such-and-such benefits at 60-70% of max heart rate, and such-and-such different benefits at 71-80%. If you aren’t convinced, just look at how different gadgets and apps define the zones differently: Your “zone 2” might be 60-70% on Apple Watch, but 65%-75% on a Peloton. At, say, 73%, the Apple Watch would say you're in zone 3 but the Peloton would say you're in zone 2. Who is right? Neither, really.\n\nResearch on the benefits of exercise doesn’t use heart rate zones, or at least not of this type. They may measure intensity in a few different ways, including whether you are above or below your ventilatory threshold (basically, whether or not you can talk while exercising) or your lactate threshold (measured through blood chemistry, but basically the highest effort you can sustain for a long time). Sometimes they’ll measure METs, which relate to how much energy you use to do work, or they'll put everything in terms of oxygen consumption (this is where the term VO2max comes from). Occasionally these studies will send participants home with heart rate-based guidelines, but those tend to be drawn from their personal scientific measurements, rather than the cookie-cutter zones you get from an app or from watching a video on youtube.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at that idea of the “talk test” or “conversational pace.” The guideline to keep your easy cardio at a chatty pace does come from a scientific concept: the ventilatory threshold.\n\nImagine you start out at a walk, and every minute or so you increase your speed a bit. As you work harder, you’ll hit a point where your breath becomes a little ragged, and your sentences choppy. If you were conversing with a friend, you'd be grunting out a few words at a time, rather than casually telling a story. That point is your ventilatory threshold, or VT (sometimes called VT1).\n\nWhen athletes or coaches talk about easy pace or easy efforts, they usually want you below your VT. The way people talk about zone 2, you’d think that the VT occurs at the top of zone 2. But nope—conversational pace is closer to 80%, which is the top of zone 3. For example, here’s a study on recreational runners that found VT1 to be, on average, at 78% of the runners’ max heart rate. And they tested the runners’ max heart rate, rather than using a formula based on age. (Never trust the default formulas.)\n\nSo if you’re trying to train at an easy pace, or if you’re using the 80/20 rule to keep 80% of your runs easy, you can do those easy runs or cardio sessions in zones 2 and 3, not just zone 3.\n\nNow that I've explained why the zone 2/zone 3 distinction is arbitrary, you see why it makes more sense to look at zones 2 and 3 (or even zones 1 through 3) as a continuum. At the lower end, you’ll be running or pedaling slower, burning fewer calories, and feeling like you’re barely doing any work. (Hello, cozy cardio!)\n\nAt the higher end (or the top of zone 3), you’re still getting a lot of aerobic work done, still benefiting your mitochondria and your capillaries and everything else, but you’re doing it in less time. If you’re interested in calorie burn per hour, zone 3 is more efficient.\n\nCyclists sometimes call training in this range the “sweet spot.” It gives you some of the advantages of harder training without making you too fatigued. For runners, zone 3 may include some of your tempo runs, some of your race-pace runs, and some of your faster “easy” runs.\n\nSo what’s the point of zone 2, if you can get all of its benefits in zone 3? That depends on your big picture: If you’re doing a lot of training, you’ll probably want some of it to be in zone 2, if only to save some energy while you’re getting more miles on your feet. But if you only run, say, three times a week, it’s unlikely that those couple of runs will wear you down much even if you do them all in zone 3.\n\nThis brings me back to my grudge against heart rate monitors. (It’s a grudge borne of love; I track my own heart rate when I run and find it useful in many ways.)\n\nYour heart rate doesn’t only track with your training effort; it also responds to a lot of other factors. For example, it responds to summer heat, showing you higher numbers in hot weather. It can also show higher numbers if you’re more fatigued, or at the end of a run compared to the beginning, and it may show higher numbers if you’re a bit dehydrated. When you run a race, you may find that your heart rate is higher than expected at the start, just because you’re a bit nervous. Some medications can alter your heart rate as well—beta blockers, for example, notoriously lower your heart rate.\n\nAnd then there’s the question of whether your fitness tracker's zones are set correctly (even knowing that, yes, their boundaries are made up). If you’ve never run an all-out race or series of hill sprints, your watch may have never seen your maximum heart rate. So if it says that your max must be 184 because you are 36 years old, it’s just grabbing numbers from a formula. That makes as much sense as buying shoes based on the average shoe size for a 5’6” woman, rather than actually measuring your feet (or trying on the shoes). If you go out for an easy run and find that your heart rate was in “zone 5” the whole time, I guarantee you that isn’t your zone 5. If you want to be precise, do one of these workouts to test your max heart rate.\n\nSo if your heart rate creeps into zone 3 on a “zone 2” training run, that may or may not be accurate. But even if it is, if you can still breathe and speak more or less normally, you’re getting plenty of benefits from your zone 3 cardio.\n\nBoth are good! If you can only do cardio a few times a week, and don't mind working hard, zone 3 is a great place to be. It's less fatiguing than HIIT, but packs more of a punch than zone 2.\n\nBut if you have more time, you may want to work toward the 50 to 60 minutes of exercise per day that researchers have found works the best at helping people lose weight and keep it off. (Here's one interesting study where this level of exercise worked even without dietary changes.) This is a lot of exercise! To get that amount of work in, most people would not be comfortable doing it all as zone 3 training—but zone 2 is a lot more doable. The more exercise you do, the more you'll need to include easier work, like zone 2, to give yourself a break from the harder days.\n\nSo if you're doing a ton of exercise, at least some of it should be zone 2, and some can be zone 3 or higher if you like. If you're only exercising a few days a week, zone 3 is probably better.\n\nEvery zone has a benefit, so if you're trying to increase your cardio fitness, you should spend time in all of them.\n\nZone 1 is good for warmups, cooldowns, and the recovery periods between intervals.\n\nZone 2 is good for long sustained efforts. It's usually OK to do zone 2 in place of a rest day.\n\nZone 3 helps you adapt to harder work than zone 3. It burns more fat but incurs a little bit more fatigue than zone 2, as we've discussed. It's also the zone where you'll practice race pace if you're training for a race like a half marathon.\n\nZone 4 helps you to work close to your lactate threshold, which improves your endurance when you're working hard. This is an important zone for athletes, but it's usually only done one or a few times per week, not for every workout.\n\nZone 5 is a very hard zone, and is great for HIIT workouts (with zone 1 work, like walking, to recover in between those hard intervals).\n\nIn general, you'll want to spend more time in the lower zones, and sprinkle in the higher zones for variety. In the 80/20 style of running, 80% of your workout time should be spent in zone 2 and low zone 3; everything from high zone 3 on up should only make up 20% of your workout time each week. This isn't the only way to structure your training, but it's a popular one that helps runners get a good balance of work in all the zones.\n\nNot at all! It got this reputation from all the coaches and writers who were trying to convince people that training medium-hard shouldn't make up all their training time. Instead, they should do some sessions easier (zone 2), and some harder (zone 4 for threshold and zone 5 for shorter and harder intervals). The idea of emphasizing the highest and lowest zones is sometimes called \"polarized training.\" But this advice somehow turned into a myth about people needing to avoid zone 3, which was never true.",

    "title": "TCL Is Launching a Digital Notebook, and It's Like a Smoother Kindle Scribe Colorsoft",
    "description": "The comfort of E Ink with the speed of an iPad.",
    "fullText": "When it comes to digital note taking, you usually have two choices: Do you want E Ink, or do you want speed? Devices like the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft and the Remarkable Paper Pro have shown there's definitely an appetite for E Ink note taking, even if it can be a bit laggy. But for the most responsive digital notebook possible, you usually have to settle for something like an iPad with a stylus. Now, TCL wants to change that.\n\nThe budget-friendly tablet and TV company has finally announced its first full-fledged digital notebook: the TCL Note A1 NXTPAPER. Launching on Kickstarter soon and releasing sometime in February, the trick here is a clever one: Notes taken on this device should look like they're written on paper, but the screen is as fast as a gaming monitor.\n\nThat's thanks to the company's NXTPAPER technology, which isn't exactly new, but has been positioned in the past more for media consumption than creation. Unlike E Ink, which uses physical ink capsules embedded in the display, NXTPAPER uses a standard LCD screen with a matte, glare-free coating and various levels of blue light and reflection-fighting software to simulate paper.\n\nThe result—which I can speak to, having gone hands-on with it over multiple CES showcases—isn't exactly as easy on the eyes as E Ink, but it is convincing, and is far more usable for just about everything that isn't just reading plain text. Considering how slow E Ink updates and how limited it is in displaying colors, that's not a bad compromise. Plus, the matte layer also acts a bit like one of those special screen protectors artists will buy to make drawing on a tablet feel more like drawing on paper. It works well enough for my chicken scratch.\n\nThe Note A1 NXTPAPER runs Android, has an 11.5-inch screen that's been TUV-certified for eye comfort, and can display 16.7 million colors and refresh at 120Hz (or up to 120 frames per second). Given that the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft can only display around 4,100 colors and has a 12-14 ms response time between inputs and updating the display, that's not bad.\n\nAnd since there's Android here, you get a few other bonuses as well, like the ability to cast your notes or Powerpoints to a digital whiteboard. TCL hasn't said if the Note A1 will be certified for the Play Store yet, but if so, it'll also be easy to download any note taking apps you want, as well as additional goodies like comic book apps. With the high refresh rate, you could even use this notebook to watch videos.\n\nAs for what sets this apart from TCL's other NXTPAPER tablets, there's a stylus included, native support for file formats ranging from Word to PDF to Excel to EPUB, and connectivity for cloud storage services like Dropbox, OneDrive, and Google Drive. Plus, if you haven't guessed from the name, there are a bunch of AI features.\n\nMuch like the Viwoods AIPaper, the Note A1 has AI transcription, translation, summarization, rewriting, and handwriting-to-text features built-in. TCL hasn't said how these will work yet, but a brief video of the device in action shows small glimpses. Personally, I'm most interested in the \"handwriting beautification\" feature, and I could see people who like doing math longhand appreciating the \"handwritten formula recognition.\"\n\nThe downside to all of this is that traditional screens don't tend to last nearly as long in between charges as E Ink ones, but with an 8,000mAh battery, TCL is hoping it can avoid that, even if it has yet to reveal official battery life numbers.\n\nWhen it launches, the TCL NXTPAPER will start at $549, as compared to the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft's and Remarkable Paper Pro's $630. That's a pretty significant savings, and seems worth considering, especially if you can't decide between E Ink and LCD. It won't be quite as easy on the eyes as a Kindle, but it could be far less frustrating for fast writers, while still feeling less computer-y than something like an iPad.",

    "description": "Exclusive: Rail firm has offered £150 for a London hotel – but says contact centre will be pragmatic on claims",
    "fullText": "An estimated 25,000 Eurostar passengers had their travel plans torn up due to the closure of the Channel Tunnel for many hours on 30 December.\n\nThirty trains connecting London St Pancras International with Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam have been cancelled.\n\nServices have now resumed, but passengers have been told that unless they have a confirmed for one of the trains that are running, they should leave the station.\n\nEven though easyJet put on extra capacity between London and Paris, air fares have soared due to the mass cancellations. The cheapest British Airways flight on New Year’s Eve is £625.\n\nThousand of people are out of position. Unfortunately for those travellers, care and compensation rules for international rail travellers are far less comprehensive and generous than for airline passengers.\n\nThese are the key questions and answers about rail passengers’ rights.\n\n“Following the suspension services of services due to overhead power supply issues in the Channel Tunnel and a failed LeShuttle train, Eurostar services to and from London will resume this evening at around 6pm following the partial reopening of the Channel Tunnel.\n\n“As the overhead power supply issues in the Channel Tunnel still remain, only one line is available to run trains on. This means there will continue to be delays and longer journey times than usual this evening.\n\n“Therefore we continue to advise our customers to rebook their journey for another day if possible, with free exchanges available.\n\n“We also advise customers not to come to our stations if their trains have been already been cancelled.\n\n“Although outside of our control, we apologise for the disruption today and will continue to keep customers updated with the latest information and support them with rescheduling their bookings.”\n\nYou can rebook, but only “in the same travel class, subject to availability”. Most unfortunately, there do not appear to be any seats on any trains for the rest of the year.\n\nIf you decide to cancel, Eurostar is offering an “e-voucher for the unused ticket, valid for 12 months”, but it would be daft to take this rather than a full cash refund.\n\nNo. In aviation, when an airline cancels a flight it must cover the cost of getting you to your destination as soon as possible (including, if nothing else is available, in Eurostar Premier class).\n\nBut that is not the case for international rail passengers. Even though air fares surged way beyond normal levels, all you can claim back from Eurostar is the original price of your ticket.\n\nTravel insurance is the best route for a claim for extra costs.\n\nThe rail firm says: “Eurostar will cover reasonable expenses, including hotel accommodation up to £150/€170 per room, per night.” The nearest Premier Inn is currently charging £192. Eurostar says the contact centre “will be pragmatic when compensating”. Taxi costs up to £50/€60 per journey are also covered, as well as food and drink expenses up to £35 / €40 per person, per day.\n\nThere is no possibility of an airline-style payout of hundreds of pounds. The best you can hope for is compensation if you travel with Eurostar on a heavily delayed service. The company offers a choice between a partial refund of the cost of your ticket, or a voucher for future travel within a year – typically worth 20 to 50 per cent more than the cash refund.\n\nDelays of under an hour do not qualify for compensation. These are the refund rates according to the length of delay:\n\n60-119 minutes: 25 per cent of journey cost in cash, or 30 per cent as a voucher\n\n120 minutes and above: 50 per cent of journey cost in cash, or 60 per cent as a voucher (increasing to 75 per cent for a delay of three hours or more)\n\nNo. You are unable to claim for costs triggered by the train cancellation, such as a hotel in Paris, Brussels or Amsterdam that you cannot reach. Travel insurance may cover such a loss.",

    "fullText": "Ulster back row Juarno Augustus will be sidelined \"for a number of weeks\" because of the ankle ligament injury he sustained in the United Rugby Championship win over Connacht in Galway.\n\nAugustus left the field midway through the second half of his team's 29-24 success at Dexcom Stadium and Ulster say the damage is \"significant\".\n\nThe former Northampton Saints number eight has initially been ruled out of Friday's URC match with Munster in Belfast.\n\n\"He's going to see someone about it on Friday,\" head coach Richie Murphy told BBC Sport NI.\n\n\"We're not sure exactly on the timeline, but yeah we won't be seeing him over the next couple of weeks. It gives him an opportunity then to retrain himself and get himself nice and fit and come back fighting bigger and stronger hopefully.\"\n\nMeanwhile Ethan McIlroy's injury woe has continued as he faces a further spell out of action after picking up a rib injury in Ballynahinch's Senior Cup Final victory over Instonians.\n\nEric O'Sullivan (hamstring), Matthew Dalton (knee), Iain Henderson (back) and Rob Herring (knee) have all resumed team training and their availability for selection will be assessed through training this week.\n\n\"It's a big boost for the squad,\" Murphy added when asked about the return of experienced Ireland internationals Herring and Henderson.\n\n\"Their experience and work in the early part of the season was really valuable for us. I think if you look at the likes of Harry Sheridan, Charlie Irvine and even Izzy [Cormac Izuchukwu], some of these younger guys, having a guy like Hendy in there is really valuable for them.\"\n\nUlster sit fifth in the URC table, three points below second-placed Munster, so have the opportunity to leapfrog their Irish interprovincial rivals in the table with a win at Affidea Stadium.",

    "fullText": "BBC coverage: Live text commentary of Sunday's games on the BBC Sport website and app (from 17:30 GMT). Also live radio commentary on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds from 21:00 GMT.\n\nThere are just two places left to play for in the NFL play-offs heading into the final week of the season but plenty more to be decided, including both top seeds and four division titles.\n\nThe NFL schedulers have come up trumps as the two remaining play-off spots can be decided in two head-to-head matches.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Ravens renew their fierce rivalry for the AFC North spot and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers need to beat the Carolina Panthers to have a chance of winning the NFC South.\n\nDenver, New England and Jacksonville could all end up as top seeds in the AFC, while the San Francisco 49ers host the Seattle Seahawks in a straight-up fight to claim top spot in the NFC.\n\nStar quarterbacks falter as 49ers eye home Super Bowl - best of week 17\n\n49ers win thriller after Browns upset Steelers - NFL week 17 recap\n\nPittsburgh Steelers (9-7) / Baltimore Ravens (8-8)\n\nThe winner of Pittsburgh against Baltimore will get the fourth seed, with division champions rewarded with a home game in the wildcard round regardless of their record.\n\nBuffalo and Los Angeles are locked in as wildcards while Houston need a win and Jacksonville defeat to jump from fifth to third.\n\nDenver will finish top seed with a win but if they lose then New England or even the Jaguars could pinch that coveted top spot.\n\nCarolina Panthers (8-8) / Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-9)\n\nCarolina or Tampa Bay will get the fourth seed and home tie depending on who wins the NFC South, but there's an added wrinkle as the Panthers could lose and still claim the division depending on Atlanta's result.\n\nGreen Bay are locked in seventh and Los Angeles could still get fifth - which when you consider could be the difference between a trip to the Eagles or Panthers/Buccaneers is well worth fighting for.\n\nThat top spot match-up between Seattle and San Francisco is the highlight though, with the difference being a first-round bye and considerable home advantage or having to go on the road being huge in the play-offs.\n\nThe top seed in the NFC and AFC both get a first-round bye and home advantage throughout the play-offs.\n\nThe remaining six teams take part in Wildcard Weekend, with three division winners playing at home against three wildcard teams - the second seed playing seventh, third hosting sixth and fourth facing fifth.\n\nFrom there, the top seeds enter the fray by hosting the lowest remaining seed left, with the next highest seed at home against the next lowest seed in the Divisional Round.\n\nThe Championship games are then contested with again the highest seed remaining hosting the game - which is why finishing in top spot can be so important.\n\nBaltimore Ravens @ Pittsburgh Steelers (01:20, Monday)\n\nThese two teams really do not like each other and they have had some street fights in their time - so a bare knuckle battle for the division will be a brutal ending as the 272nd and final regular season game on the schedule.\n\nBaltimore started 1-5 and have lost three of the past five while the Steelers have been consistently inconsistent all season, yet thanks to an unusually weak division this year one side will make the post-season.\n\nAaron Rodgers almost clinched a play-off return on Sunday but the 42-year-old just couldn't find a late touchdown pass against lowly Cleveland.\n\nMissing dominant receiver DK Metcalf, suspended after an altercation with a fan, could cost Pittsburgh dear.\n\nTwo-time MVP Lamar Jackson is a doubt for Baltimore with a back injury, but running back Derrick Henry exploded for over 200 yards and four touchdowns in his last game.\n\nHenry could be the x-factor here in a straight play-in game - the winner goes to the play-offs, the loser goes home.\n\nSeattle Seahawks @ San Francisco 49ers (01:00, Sunday)\n\nThe NFC West title is up for grabs but more importantly all the trappings of the top seeding as San Francisco host Seattle at Levi's Stadium - which also hosts February's Super Bowl.\n\nIt looks like attack versus defence here with the 49ers the league's top scorers since Brock Purdy returned from injury in week 11, coming off their first back-to-back 40-point games in 30 years.\n\nAnd they need it as without star defenders Fred Warner and Nick Bosa they've also been leaking points - as witnessed during their wild shootout win over Chicago on Sunday.\n\nSeattle's defence is the second best in the NFL with just over 18 points a game allowed and the team moved to 7-1 on the road this season after smothering Carolina on Sunday - allowing Bryce Young to pass for just 54 yards.\n\nQuarterback Sam Darnold is the only man ever to have successive 13-win seasons with two different teams, but he leads the league with 20 turnovers after an interception and fumble in Carolina.\n\nDarnold was in this position last season with Minnesota, but lost in Detroit before having a play-off nightmare against the Rams. He needs to avoid sloppy turnovers to avoid a repeat.\n\nCarolina Panthers @ Tampa Bay Buccaneers (21:30 Saturday)\n\nBaker Mayfield was in the early MVP race but the Buccaneers have fallen off a cliff since with four straight defeats making it seven losses in eight games.\n\nCarolina have also fluffed their lines though when given the chance, so one team will stumble over the line - and not much will be expected of either in the play-offs.\n\nFor the Panthers it is a win-and-in game as victory will book a play-off spot, but not for Tampa Bay as even if Carolina lose they will still take the division if Atlanta beat New Orleans.\n\nThat's because wins for the Bucs and Falcons would see all three teams finish on 8-9 - the first three-way division tie since 2011 - and Carolina hold the best record in head-to-head matches.\n\nTennessee Titans @ Jacksonville Jaguars (18:00, Sunday)\n\nMiami Dolphins @ New England Patriots (21:25, Sunday)\n\nLos Angeles Chargers @ Denver Broncos (21:25, Sunday)\n\nDenver should really get the job done here as Chargers boss Jim Harbaugh has already said he will rest quarterback Justin Herbert and any other starters that need it with a wildcard the best they can do.\n\nThe Broncos have the tiebreaker edge on the Patriots so just need to win, but should Denver stumble, New England can bag top spot with a win over Miami.\n\nJacksonville need to beat the Titans, as they should, and have the Broncos and Patriots both lose to claim an unlikely top seed.\n\nThe Jags will just have to focus on victory though, as they could suffer a big trapdoor fall if they suffer an upset defeat with Houston waiting in the wings.\n\nA Jacksonville loss and Houston victory will give the Texans the AFC South title, third seed and a home play-off tie with the Jags hitting the road as a wildcard.\n\nAll three sides are big favourites to win so things really should stay as they are, but funny things can happen in the NFL.\n\nCarolina Panthers @ Tampa Bay Buccaneers (21:30)\n\nSeattle Seahawks @ San Francisco 49ers (01:00, Sunday)\n\nNew Orleans Saints @ Atlanta Falcons (18:00)\n\nCleveland Browns @ Cincinnati Bengals (18:00)\n\nGreen Bay Packers @ Minnesota Vikings (18:00)\n\nDallas Cowboys @ New York Giants (18:00)\n\nTennessee Titans @ Jacksonville Jaguars (18:00)\n\nIndianapolis Colts @ Houston Texans (18:00)\n\nNew York Jets @ Buffalo Bills (21:25)\n\nMiami Dolphins @ New England Patriots (21:25)\n\nDetroit Lions @ Chicago Bears (21:25)\n\nLos Angeles Chargers @ Denver Broncos (21:25)\n\nKansas City Chiefs @ Las Vegas Raiders (21:25)\n\nArizona Cardinals @ Los Angeles Rams (21:25)\n\nWashington Commanders @ Philadelphia Eagles (21:25)\n\nBaltimore Ravens @ Pittsburgh Steelers (01:20, Monday)",

    "fullText": "A fan group says \"alarm bells should be ringing at Fifa\" over the fact England supporters have not taken up their full ticket allocation for next summer's World Cup final and semi-final.\n\nSo far the number of allocated tickets to members of the England Supporters Travel Club (ESTC) exceeds the number of applications received, meaning everyone who has applied for a ticket to the final and semi-final is guaranteed one.\n\nThe pricing structure for the tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico has been widely criticised, with about 90% of tickets for the final made available to ESTC members costing £3,094.\n\nThat led to Fifa introducing a limited number of tickets at £45, but the Football Supporters' Association's Fans' Embassy says England fans not taking up their allocation should be a concern.\n\n\"Whilst unsurprisingly the group games are oversubscribed, as well as the possible glamour tie in Mexico City in the round of 16, the numbers for the semi-final and final speak for themselves,\" the group said in a statement.\n\n\"The numbers are reflective of a fan base that has been priced out, and some of the most loyal supporters of the international game feel completely let down.\n\n\"Alarm bells should be ringing whenever participating member allocations, meant for the most loyal fans, are not sold out for any game at a World Cup.\"\n\nFifa has been criticised for group stage tickets for next year's World Cup costing up to three times those for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\n\nEarlier this week Fifa president Gianni Infantino defended the prices, saying they reflect the public's \"absolutely crazy\" demand for tickets.\n\n\"We have six to seven million tickets on sale and in 15 days we received 150 million ticket requests,\" Infantino said.\n\n\"So 10 million ticket requests every single day.

The only time I felt some nerves was when I was throwing to win it and then at the end.\"\n\nHood, who began the tournament ranked 86th in the world, is provisionally into the top 50 thanks to his victory over Northern Ireland's Rock - who had been tipped as a potential tournament winner.",

You must carefully place climber Aava’s hands and feet to make your way up a forbidding mountain, camping on ledges and bandaging her fingers as you go. Like real climbing, it is challenging and somewhat brutal. \n\n PC, PlayStation 5; 29 January\n\nA two-player animated horror game in the Tim Burton mode, minus all the whimsy. In a setup reminiscent of the famously discomfiting games Limbo and Inside, a brother and sister must escape a twisted mockery of their home town, finding their friends as they go. They are stalked by horrible spike-limbed monsters and grotesquely reanimated creatures. Genuinely frightening and artistically impressive. \n\n Nintendo Switch 2, PC, PlayStation5, Xbox; 13 February\n\nCapcom’s horror series is very old, but it still comes up with new ways to make your skin crawl. In Requiem we play as bookish Grace, whom the game’s director calls “the biggest scaredy-cat in Resident Evil history”, and the confidently combat-proficient cop Leon S Kennedy, pursued by monsters through the iconic Raccoon City. \n\n Nintendo Switch 2, PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox; 27 February\n\nImagine dropping Pokémon into the world of Animal Crossing, with a hint of Minecraft’s blocky aesthetic. This family-friendly Nintendo game has you building and tending habitats for Nintendo’s beloved creatures. You play as a Ditto, the shape-shifting pink blob, which can helpfully transform into other Pokémon, using those other critters’ abilities to bring a barren landscape back to life and build a vibrant town. \n\n Nintendo Switch 2, 5 March\n\nThe most anticipated James Bond game since the Nintendo 64’s GoldenEye 007. Made by IO Interactive, famous for Hitman, it stars a younger, twentysomething Bond who has not yet earned his 007 status, and hopes to blend the expected car chases, shootouts and gadgets with some genuine spycraft, as Bond infiltrates parties and digs for information. \n\n Nintendo Switch 2, PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox; 27 May\n\nFrom the Finnish developer behind Returnal, the exceptional, intelligent time-loop sci-fi shooter, this mysterious action game stars another stranded astronaut on a different hostile planet, one where a dying sun is sending its creatures and colonists mad. Long-time gamers will recognise the lineage of arcade bullet-hell shooters in this very modern action game. \n\n PlayStation 5; 30 April\n\nIt has been in development for more than a decade and, despite several delays (GTA VI was on this very list last year), expectations have never been higher for the biggest game in the world. It’s a crime story and a love story, featuring the series’ first female protagonist, Lucia, and her boyfriend, Jason, and set in Rockstar’s fictional Floridian state of Leonida. There has been so much to satirise about contemporary America since 2013’s GTA V that Rockstar’s writers will surely have been spoilt for choice. \n\n PlayStation 5, Xbox; 19 November\n\nThe modern Spider-Man games have gone down a storm, so it’s no surprise that developer Insomniac is now turning its attention to a different Marvel hero. This new game features an ensemble X-Men cast and a whole lot of gratuitous comic-book violence, as Wolverine sticks those adamantium claws through a succession of foes trying to chase him down. \n\n PlayStation 5; date TBC\n\nLooking for an alternative to established wizarding-school fiction? Witchbrook is a charming pixel-art slice-of-life game about a witches’ college. In school you learn spells and broom flight; outside school you involve yourself in the life of the whimsical town outside. It supports four players at once, too. \n\n PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox; TBC",

    "fullText": "Our reporting revealed a symbiotic relationship between the IDF and Silicon Valley – with implications for the future of warfare\n\nIn January this year, Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham first reported that Microsoft had deepened its ties to Israel alongside other major tech firms. Since then, the Guardian has published an award-winning series of investigations – in partnership with the Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and the Hebrew-language outlet Local Call – that has revealed a symbiotic relationship between Silicon Valley and the Israeli military.\n\nOne investigation exposed an Israeli mass surveillance program scooping up virtually all Palestinian phone calls and storing them on Microsoft’s cloud services – setting off an inquiry that ultimately prompted the company to cut off Israel’s access to some of its technology. Another story revealed that the Israeli military created a ChatGPT-like tool to analyze data collected through the surveillance of Palestinians. Yet another revealed that Google and Amazon had agreed to extraordinary terms to clinch a lucrative contract with Israel.\n\nI asked Davies and Abraham to discuss what they learned this year – about the role of these technologies in Israel’s assault on Gaza, whether these business ties are sustainable, and what the revelations tell us about how the wars of the future will be fought.\n\nHow did Israel’s relationships with these companies change after October 7?\n\nYuval Abraham: The Israeli military had been fetishizing artificial intelligence and big data for many years – a trend that is very much connected to Israel’s occupation of the Palestinians, because the occupation generates a lot of data. What changed after October 7 was the scope. The military was looking to bomb hundreds of targets every day in Gaza. Tens of thousands of people were recruited into reserve duty. That meant a huge spike in usage of technological systems. That’s where the big tech companies stepped in.\n\nHarry Davies: There was a huge surge in demand – not just for the storage capacities of the tech companies, but also for the products that they offer to analyze the information used to prosecute a war. What’s valuable for the military is the way in which these services are able to provide what’s known as “blob storage”, which allows them to store and process infinite amounts of raw intelligence information.\n\nWhat has made Israel such an appealing market for these companies?\n\nYuval Abraham: As we reported, the Israeli army has been collecting Palestinian phone calls for a long time. But when you want to collect the phone calls of an entire population every day, and you want to retain those phone calls for long periods of time, you need a lot of storage room and processing power.\n\nIf you remember the [Edward] Snowden revelations, many of them had to do with metadata, which doesn’t weigh a lot. But the Israeli military also wanted to store mass audio files, images or videos – and for that it felt it needed the assistance of companies like Microsoft. In the West Bank, sources have told us this information has been used to find dirt on people to blackmail them. In the Gaza Strip, we know that this massive trove of intercepted phone calls was also used in airstrikes that killed civilians.\n\nSo data is power and data is control. And these American cloud providers allow the Israeli military to store a lot of data and to sift through it very effectively. That has direct consequences for people on the ground.\n\nIf you have something to share about this story, you can contact Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham using one of the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories. Messages are end to end encrypted and concealed within the routine activity that every Guardian mobile app performs. This prevents an observer from knowing that you are communicating with us at all, let alone what is being said.\n\nIf you don’t already have the Guardian app, download it (iOS/Android) and go to the menu. Select ‘Secure Messaging’.\n\nTo send a message to Harry and Yuval please choose the ‘UK Investigations’ team.\n\nYou can message Harry using the Signal Messenger app. Use the ‘find by username’ option and type hfd.90\n\nIf you don’t need a high level of security or confidentiality you can email harry.davies@theguardian.com\n\nSecureDrop and other secure methods\n\nIf you can safely use the tor network without being observed or monitored you can send messages and documents to the Guardian via our SecureDrop platform.\n\nFinally, our guide at theguardian.com/tips lists several ways to contact us securely, and discusses the pros and cons of each.\n\nHarry Davies: Yossi Sariel, the former head of [Israel’s elite spy agency] Unit 8200, wrote a book under a pseudonym that we revealed to have been published by him. In that book, he articulated what at the time was a bold and radical vision – as Yuval described, this fetishization of Silicon Valley technology. He recognized the possibilities that the likes of Google, Amazon and Microsoft could afford the Israeli military. Two years before October 7, he said that militaries and governments needed to forge relationships with these companies that are similar to the relationships they have with companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin. So he was already thinking about these companies as instrumental to war and surveillance in the way that a defense contractor provides components for fighter jets or manufactures bombs and missiles.\n\nSome of our reporting has looked at how elements of his vision have come true and have been put into effect, both before October 7 and afterwards, in both the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nWe know AI is central to Israel’s military operations – its army has developed its own AI capabilities, as you revealed, Yuval, and has also purchased AI tools for use from Microsoft. Why is AI so central to Israel’s broader war aims?\n\nYuval Abraham: What AI did was allow Israel to achieve the effective results of carpet bombing without losing the legitimacy of a data-driven assault with targets and objectives. In Gaza, one way in which the Israeli military used AI was to give a score to almost every person in Gaza who has a phone number, determining how likely it was that person was a member of Hamas or Islamic Jihad. This score was based on a machine-learning algorithm [developed by Israel] called Lavender. It was trained on a dataset of known Hamas members. AI allowed the Israeli military to generate and bomb tens of thousands of military targets, on a scale that without AI would not have been humanly possible. Many of the targets were not Hamas members, according to sources. And Israel for the most part bombed these people not while they were engaged in military activity, but when they stepped inside their families’ homes.\n\nThese AI systems had an error rate that the Israeli military knew about. But to me, the key thing about AI is not the mistakes that it makes. It’s the scale of destruction that it allows militaries to unleash, and it’s a discourse of legitimacy that it enables – a discourse of targets and collateral damage.\n\nAI also seems to me to incentivize mass surveillance, right? Because it allows for the analysis of ever-growing reams of information.\n\nHarry Davies: Signals intelligence agencies have long collected more information than they could humanly process. That served as a kind of restraint on their ability to conduct mass surveillance. I think we’re now seeing a shift where AI allows an intelligence agency like Unit 8200 to make sense of things that previously it struggled to make sense of.\n\nMicrosoft explicitly credited your reporting for changing its policies. Are you seeing any other signs of shifts within the tech industry?\n\nHarry Davies: I think we’re seeing a lot of discomfort and dissent within these companies at both a junior and to some extent senior level. Many employees have been disturbed to find what the products and services that they’re working around the clock to build and market are actually contributing to. There have been protest groups which have emerged from current and former employees within these companies. That’s true across Silicon Valley. I think that played some role in the decision that Microsoft made as a result of our reporting. They were facing a lot of pressure internally.\n\nYuval Abraham: And there’s also a legal question for these companies: if the ICJ [international court of justice] ends up ruling that Israel has committed a genocide, then a follow-up question will be: who contributed to that genocide? Which companies helped maintain it and sustain it? For some people in these companies who are thinking ahead, that could also be a cause for concern.\n\nIt sounds like you think shifts in public support for Israel could actually affect these business relationships.\n\nYuval Abraham: Israel has developed a reliance on these companies for its Nimbus project, which is a huge contract signed between Israel and Google and Amazon back in 2021. It is moving the data of many of its government ministries, along with troves of information from the Ministry of Defense, onto these companies’ cloud servers.\n\nThese are US companies. They’re taking a certain gamble here that the US will stay loyal to Israel and won’t block, limit or sanction them.\n\nMicrosoft only blocked access to technology that was specifically enabling the mass surveillance of Palestinian phone calls – there are still many relationships between Microsoft and the Israeli military. But Microsoft’s action made many people in the Israeli system nervous. It was the first time we know of that a big tech company withdrew services from the Israeli military. It made some people ask whether Israel is making a mistake by giving these foreign companies so much leverage. That question is folded within a larger question of what the US will do, what will happen in 2028 if there’s a more progressive administration in the White House, at a time when so many Americans believe that Israel has committed a genocide in Gaza.\n\nWhat’s your focus going to be in 2026?\n\nYuval Abraham: I think we only uncovered the tip of the iceberg.\n\nHarry Davies: We’re both very conscious that, although we have spent a lot of time working on this, we still just have glimpses inside the system. We’re continuing to build a fuller picture of how this technology was and continues to be used in Gaza and in the West Bank as well.\n\nThere’s good reason to continue paying attention. Militaries pay attention to what other militaries are doing. There is great interest among other western militaries in how Israel prosecuted this war, in how it integrated these kind of technologies.\n\nAnd there are other militaries whose combat systems and processes are already deeply integrated with Silicon Valley tech. Take the American military, for example. Look at what’s happening right now in the Caribbean. Are those operations somehow free of the involvement or reliance on systems and services provided by these companies? I suspect not. We don’t know for sure, but the Pentagon and the US military have very big contracts with all of these companies to provide cloud services. Post-Gaza, we have to look at these relationships and ask: what is the involvement of these companies and their technology in military decisions, in military operations and in warfare more broadly?\n\nYuval Abraham: Much of our reporting is based on whistleblowers, on individuals who are in proximity to power or hold positions of power.\n\nHarry Davies: Our confidential sources have remained confidential and we are always interested in hearing from new people. Our door is always open.\n\nIf you have something to share about this story, you can contact Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham using one of the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

You have to go back to 2016 to find a season with more tryless games.\n\nThe changing of the coach may not be a panacea. But who dictates and implements the culture at a club? Who is responsible for the style of play? Who chooses the players and the supporting coaching staff? We can't change the squad en masse so that leaves one option whether it fits the narrative or not.\n\nEdinburgh need a coach with drive and a sense of purpose because we are rudderless and only our lack of direction is preventing us from running aground entirely.\n\nSandy Smith can be found at The Burgh Watch",

    "description": "What can we expect in the Trojans' final game of the 2025 season?",
    "fullText": "Prior to each USC football game this season, I will be giving five predictions for the contest. With the Trojans playing their final game of the year against TCU in the Alamo Bowl Tuesday night, this marks the season finale of this series.\n\nSo what can we expect when the Trojans and Horned Frogs face off in San Antonio? Here are five predictions for the Alamo Bowl between USC and TCU:\n\nUSC running back King Miller needs 127 yards rushing against TCU to hit 1,000 yards on the season. He does not quite hit that mark, but he does go over 100 yards and score at least one touchdown.\n\nUSC will be without its top two tight ends in the Alamo Bowl with Lake McRee opting out and Walker Lyons entering the transfer portal. Given that USC's remaining tight ends combined for exactly one reception on the season, I am predicting that the unit does not record a single catch against TCU.\n\nTuesday night will mark D'Anton Lynn's final game as USC's defensive coordinator, as he is headed to Penn State afterwards to take the DC job there. Lynn goes out with a bang, as his USC defense holds TCU to 24 or fewer points.\n\nIn today's era of college football with bowl rosters often looking very different from regular season rosters, it is not uncommon to see unlikely heroes emerge. Last year for USC, it was Kyle Ford catching the game-winning touchdown in the final seconds of the Las Vegas Bowl. This year, I am going with Jaden Richardson to finally score his first FBS touchdown in his final college football game.\n\nBowl games typically feature a player of the game award. My final prediction of the season is that quarterback Jayden Maiava earns this honor as he leads the Trojans to their tenth victory of the year.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Trojans Wire: Five predictions as USC football faces TCU in Alamo Bowl",

    "fullText": "The conversations about whether or not Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce will catch another pass from Patrick Mahomes have dominated his retirement rumors. Kelce's in-depth conversation with team legend Tony Gonzalez aired on Prime Sports before last Thursday's Christmas game and addressed multiple topics, including Mahomes.\n\nThe conversation was filmed at Kelce and Patrick Mahomes' 1587 Prime restaurant, with the 11-time Pro Bowler opening up about his friendship with the two-time league MVP.\n\n\"He's (Patrick Mahomes) family now. I think through all the hard work and all the family time that we've had outside the facility and outside the building, there'll definitely never be a goodbye to him, It'll just be like another day in the life with Patty Mahomes.\" said Kelce, \"What he's been to my career up to this point, you can't measure it. It's all the little things that you see manifest out there onto the field that we're working on every single week, every single offseason. When he came into the league, he took this thing by storm. It's been a fun ride ever since he's been at the helm.\"\n\nSince Mahomes became the starting quarterback in 2018, the duo has been inseparable on the field. Their production and chemistry are unmatched, but their future remains murky heading into the offseason, especially after Kelce was asked that question during a recent press conference.\n\n\"That was a harsh reality when I got asked that. I was like, 'Oh man, that's a dark way to look at it.' I think, I don't know, I'll always be able to go out there in the backyard slinging around with the old Texas gunslinger,\" said Kelce, \"But you know that day is going to come. If it's already happened, I can feel pretty content with how many times he's connected on the field with me and how much success and how much fun we've had playing this game.\"\n\nMahomes was in attendance during the Chiefs' Christmas night home finale against the Denver Broncos.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Chiefs TE Travis Kelce opens up about friendship with Patrick Mahomes",

    "description": "Notre Dame football got great news on Monday as head coach Marcus Freeman won’t entertain NFL offers, and here are the top social media reactions.",
    "fullText": "It was a huge Monday for Notre Dame football, as head coach Marcus Freeman turned down the NFL to stay in South Bend.\n\nThere were multiple rumors about teams going after the Irish head coach, especially after the disappointing end to the year with missing the College Football Playoff. In the end, Freeman never reportedly took an interview and will continue his quest to win a championship for Notre Dame.\n\nIt can’t be understated how huge this news is, as Freeman has turned the program into what many thought he couldn’t, a perennial national championship contender. Last year was proof the Irish are close, and hopefully this season is motivation for 2026.\n\nAs social media always does, it was quick to react to the news. Here are some of the top reactions to Notre Dame retaining Marcus Freeman for at least another season.\n\nOn Monday morning, Marcus Freeman informed two NFL franchises that had been in communication with him about their jobs that he was staying at Notre Dame, sources tell Sports Illustrated pic.twitter.com/UHJV3WV7rV\n\n— Sports Illustrated (@SInow) December 29, 2025\n\nInteresting that it was multiple teams that went after Freeman, as it was only really known that the New York Giants were interested. Sports Illustrated’s Pat Forde had at least one other team who saw him as a good fit for their organization.\n\nA win for college football https://t.co/xF2VfL08AE\n\n— J.D. PicKell (@jdpickell) December 29, 2025\n\nCollege football won today, keeping one of its best away from the professional ranks. Notre Dame clearly is the biggest winner here, but this move sends waves across the top-levels of the game.\n\nMarcus Freeman off the market for NFL teams ... https://t.co/hsJrl3gWDa\n\n— Albert Breer (@AlbertBreer) December 29, 2025\n\nWas there ever really a true market for Freeman, anyone could say that they were interested. You have to wonder how he’ll react if he’s asked about this in a future press conference.\n\nSources confirm coach Marcus Freeman will be back at Notre Dame for the 2026 season and will receive an enhanced contract with the school, as athletic director Pete Bevacqua indicated earlier this month. @ByPatForde first reported.\n\n— Adam Rittenberg (@ESPNRittenberg) December 29, 2025\n\nWorth every penny. Give Freeman a blank check. Don’t let him leave South Bend.\n\nTHE GOAT IS BACK LETS RIDE COACH!!! https://t.co/J7BGjfEJZ8\n\n— ☘️ (@WeAreNDFans) December 29, 2025\n\nThis might be a bit of an overreaction, but getting Freeman back is huge for the 2026 season. He’s the driving force behind the program and will have a loaded team next fall.\n\nOn Monday morning, Marcus Freeman informed two NFL teams that had been in contact with him about their head-coaching openings that he’s staying at Notre Dame, sources told Sports Illustrated’s Pat Forde 👀 Natty incoming 2026?\n\n— Talia Baia (@talia_baia) December 29, 2025\n\nGet used to it, as long as Freeman is in South Bend, this is the new normal. Notre Dame should continue to contend for championships and should be one of the few teams that can actually win-it-all next fall.\n\nGreat move by Freeman and ND to shutdown the NFL talk so quickly.\n\nI remember the Brian Kelly to NFL talk after the national championship game run lingered for a long time (Kelly made no secret he was actively interested).\n\nIt really killed our momentum in recruiting & retention.\n\n— G'Irish Talk 🎙️ (@GIrish_Talk) December 29, 2025\n\nWith the transfer portal season coming up, having stability at the head coaching position is huge, and Notre Dame now has that. Players won’t have to worry if Freeman will leave after the window closes, as he’s already announced his return.\n\nI ask myself that every day, but I think his time at Notre Dame is not going to be much longer. Two offseasons in a row he's shown some level of interest in other jobs, mainly in the NFL. Even more so this offseason. If ND is as good as I think they will be in 2026, could be his…\n\n— Bryan Driskell (@CoachD178) December 29, 2025\n\nDriskell is one of the best on the Notre Dame beat, and hopefully his gut is wrong. You can’t deny his read on the situation, it has been back-to-back off-seasons dealing with Freeman potentially heading off to the NFL. Time will tell what ends up happening, but what we know now is that he’ll be coaching Notre Dame next fall.\n\nContact/Follow us @IrishWireND on X (Formerly Twitter), and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Notre Dame news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fighting Irish Wire: Social media reacts to Marcus Freeman staying with Notre Dame for 2026",

Like Buffalo, Minnesota has never won a Super Bowl. However, during this time, the Vikings made appearances in 1974, 1975, and 1977.\n\nThen there was the Pittsburgh Steelers’ “Steel Curtain.” This iteration of the Steelers won their division from 1974 to 1979. They appeared in and won four Super Bowls during those six years.\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams held the record for most consecutive divisional titles for 30 years after winning seven in a row starting in 1973. These Rams’ seasons usually ended in a conference championship loss to one of the other teams on this list, but they did manage to make one Super Bowl in the final year of their run.\n\nMost recently, we have the Kansas City Chiefs, whose failure to win the AFC West this season ended their stab at the Patriots’ record. The Chiefs made five Super Bowls during their nine-year reign atop the division, winning three.\n\nBut none compares to New England’s NFL record 11-year division title streak starting in 2009 and ending when Buffalo claimed its first.\n\nThe Patriots appeared in eight straight AFC Conference Championship Games, made five Super Bowl appearances and lifted three Lombardi Trophies.\n\nDrake Maye Boasts ‘It’s Harder To Light Me Up Than You Think’",

    "fullText": "Many players contributed to Auburn basketball's dominating 106-65 win over Queens University in its final nonconference game of the season.\n\nAs a team, Auburn connected on 15 three-pointers, won the rebound battle, 40-26, and recorded 13 steals. The Tigers also shared the wealth by notching 22 assists. Auburn head coach Steven Pearl was encouraged by what he saw out of his team on Monday, especially in the first half.\n\n\"The first half looked like Auburn basketball again, which was encouraging,\" Pearl said. \"Second half, their ball pressure bothered us some. We've got to do a better job with that.\"\n\nAn amazing team effort led to many stellar individual performances. Here is a look at who Auburn Wire writers, as well as Auburn fans, chose as their \"Tiger of the Game\" following Auburn's win over Queens.\n\nHall set the tone of the game by scoring 16 first-half points, going 3-of-5 from three-point and 6-of-9 overall from the field. He scored just two points in the 2nd half, but his first-half efforts helped Auburn establish its dominance early on.\n\nOverton was consistent in Monday's win over Queens. He connected on four field goals in the 1st half to take 13 points into the locker room, and added 10 more points in the 2nd half to finish second in scoring with 23. He was a key piece to Auburn's impressive three-point shooting as he led the team in the category with five makes.\n\nSophomore guard Elyjah Freeman played efficiently on offense for the Tigers. From the beginning, it looked like a night was going to be in the cards for him after a monster dunk off an alley oop from Keyshawn Hall. Freeman shot 9-13 from the field, scored 27 points, and hauled in three rebounds in just 23 minutes. The Tigers could use another offensive piece outside of Hall, Overton, and Pettiford to step up in time for conference play.\n\nAuburn fans have spoken, and Elyjah Freeman is the \"Tiger of the Game\" from Auburn's win over Queens, beating out Kevin Overton, Keyshawn Hall, and Tahaad Pettiford.

The veteran was injured in the team's season opener against Miami (Ohio) on Aug. 28, then returned for just one series during its loss to Maryland on Sept. 20. He attempted only 16 total passes as a Badger, completing seven for 113 total yards and zero touchdowns.\n\nThe veteran began his career at Wake Forest in 2021.

Edwards would appear in 15 games as a backup in 2022 and 2023, completing 38 of 76 passes for 441 yards, four touchdowns and one interception during that time. He then delivered an excellent season as the starter in 2024, throwing for 2,881 yards, 15 touchdowns and nine interceptions.\n\nEdwards is set to return for his sixth season of college football in 2026.

    "title": "6 NFL coaches on the hot seat for Black Monday",
    "description": "Will the ax fall on Kevin Stefanski, Mike McDaniel or Shane Steichen? We'll know the day after the 2025 NFL regular season wraps.",
    "fullText": "For 18 teams, the 2026 NFL season begins once Week 18 ends. For a select few, that means leaving losing coaches behind and starting fresh. While there are always a handful of firings across the course of the season — this year that included Tennessee Titans play-caller Brian Callahan and New York Giants former NFL coach of the year Brian Daboll — there's no worse day to be a struggling NFL coach than the day after the season is finished.\n\nBlack Monday is the scourge of underperforming playbook architects. It will claim a handful of careers to ring in the new year January 5, opening the door to coaching interviews and new hires that will energize fan bases across the world — though whether that's a good thing or bad thing will hinge heavily on the candidate. So who could be the recipient of bad headlines the first day after the 2025 NFL regular season ends?\n\nGlenn should be at the top of this list, but New York's reported insistence it will keep him suggests he's safe barring an absolute disaster in Week 18. We cannot rule this out, because absolute disaster has been a hallmark of Glenn's first season as an NFL head coach.\n\nHe started his tenure with seven straight losses. Somehow, the four-game losing streak in which he's currently mired feels worse; his Jets have been outscored by an average margin of just under 27 points per game — and that includes showdowns with sub-.500 teams like the Dolphins and New Orleans Saints. Injuries and trades have depleted both sides of the ball, but you'd be hard pressed to find anything New York does well in 2025.\n\nJustin Fields, Glenn's flier QB addition, has been either injured or terrible this fall. Garrett Wilson's injury turned the receiving corps into a host of replacement-caliber players. None of the team's three starting wideouts in Week 17 began their season on the Jets' active roster. Sauce Gardner and Quinnen Williams were traded in-season. Qwan'tez Stiggers, Dean Clark and Jarvis Brownlee have all made multiple starts in the secondary — a group that has yet to record an interception this fall.\n\nKeeping Glenn suggests owner Woody Johnson is chalking a brutal 2025 up to an undermanned depth chart and some bad personnel decisions. Still, it's tough to look at the Jets defense and its massive regression from Robert Saleh's peak and think Glenn has the ability to map out a cogent plan as the season wears on and the world changes around him.\n\nHe's set to get another try with multiple first round draft picks and more than $90 million in salary cap room for 2026. Failing there could set the Jets up for another generation of regret.\n\nStefanski is Cleveland's Sisyphus, only if management stepped in to give him a larger, heavier boulder after he'd cleared the halfway point of his mountain. The coach who guided Baker Mayfield to the franchise's first playoff win since 1994 and won 11 games by making Joe Flacco the NFL comeback player of the year (in just six games) has been constantly hamstrung by his franchise's inability to find a viable quarterback.\n\nCleveland traded three first round picks before handing Deshaun Watson a fully guaranteed $230 million despite more than 20 accusations of sexual misconduct and what the NFL itself described as \"predatory behavior\" dating to his time in Houston. For the privilege of blocking the team's most obvious pathways to roster improvement, Watson has played 19 games in four seasons and been the NFL's 48th-best quarterback when on the field.\n\nHis absence has cleared the way for the Browns to improve from 32nd in scoring offense last season to... 31st. The offensive line, once a strength, has devolved into one of the league's worst units. Bright spots remain thanks to Quinshon Judkins and Harold Fannin Jr., but there may not be a coach alive or dead who could coax this team to a respectable record.\n\nAfter that playoff win in his debut, Stefanski has had a losing record in four of the last five seasons. He deserves better. Cleveland firing him could clear him up to actually receive it. Expecting the Browns to do better with his replacement, however, is a tough ask.\n\nMorris got the Atlanta job over Bill Belichick. While he's been better (and less of a circus) than the nine-time Super Bowl winner has at North Carolina, he hasn't inspired confidence. Somehow, remarkably, Morris found a way to beat the Buffalo Bills but lose to the New York Jets — threading a needle that completes the world's tackiest jacket.\n\nQuarterback play has been an issue, with Michael Penix Jr.'s injury giving way to a diminished Kirk Cousins and spurts of inspiring play cropping up like islands in a sea of mediocrity. Atlanta has a galaxy of high level skill players, but thanks to injury and ineffectiveness ranks only 22nd in expected points added (EPA) per play this fall. Pouring draft capital into the pass rush has improved the defense, but that unit has gone from 20th in EPA allowed to... 19th.\n\nOutside help will be difficult to find. Releasing or trading Cousins would shave up to $35 million from the team's 2026 salary cap — useful, considering it's already over the estimated spending limit next fall — but may not be practical with Penix recovering from his third ACL tear. The team's first round pick is owed to the Los Angeles Rams as a result of the trade that made James Pearce a Falcon (he was drafted with the 26th overall selection. Atlanta's pick is shaping up to land in or around the top 10. It's not ideal!).\n\nThat could give Morris one more chance to clean up the mess he's maintained for the past two seasons. If he can fix the defense and lean on guys like Drake London and Bijan Robinson on offense, it could be enough to rise to the top of the NFC South's shallow pool. The help will have to mostly come from within the franchise. With a still-young core, the opportunity for a turnaround will persist. So far, Morris has proven incapable of seizing it.\n\nHow much of the Colts' injury-related crashout will be heaped at the feet of Steichen and general manager Chris Ballard? Indianapolis was once 7-1. Now it's at risk of finishing 2025 with a losing record.\n\nSteichen and Ballard came into the year on the hot seat, emerged as potential award winners over the first half of the season and then shrank from the spotlight as things went sour. Injuries to Daniel Jones and Anthony Richardson didn't help, but that doesn't explain a defense that ranked 10th in expected points added (EPA) per play allowed in the first half of the season slid to 23rd in the second half. Sure, a rise of three-and-outs from an offense eventually commandeered by a 44-year-old Philip Rivers didn't help. Even so, that's a dramatic backslide for a team that held three opponents to 14 points or fewer through Week 8 and has held a single opponent to fewer than 20 points in the nine weeks since.\n\nThe Colts are heading into their first full offseason without former owner Jim Irsay at the helm in four decades. Current principal owner Carlie Irsay-Gordon and her sisters have been raised in a football world and understand the big swings he took to make Indianapolis great for a long stretch (and bad-to-mediocre for a longer one). Would they opt for a clean break to start fresh this January? Or did Jones' revival and subsequent injury create enough plausible deniability to run it back next fall?\n\nInjury luck has been unkind to Gannon, certainly. But it doesn't excuse the fact he's won 30 percent of his games in Arizona over nearly three full seasons. With Kyler Murray shut down for the season (officially due to a foot injury, but unofficially because he was uninspiring and lacked the efficiency and consistency of, big sigh, Jacoby Brissett), the Cardinals have lost eight straight games. Despite a 3-13 record, they may not wind up with a top-three draft pick from it thanks to the league's hardest strength of schedule.\n\nEven without a top-two pick in a two-quarterback draft (we'll see how the spring workouts shake out for Ty Simpson et al), we may have seen the end of the Murray era in Arizona. The former first overall pick has played more than 11 games only once in his last four seasons. His 0.084 EPA per dropback ranks 23rd among 53 quarterbacks to play at least 500 snaps in that stretch, which isn't terrible but also hasn't resulted in success. The Cardinals haven't had a winning season since 2021.\n\nTrading away Murray would create more than $35 million in salary cap savings and a clean slate for a team unable to get out of its own way. Would Arizona trust a new franchise quarterback to the head coach who engineered a top-three offense in Philadelphia to get the job, then built the league's 17th-best offense in the three years that followed? While Gannon coaxed another forgettably solid year out of Brissett, his lack of wins suggests the ceiling for another veteran QB wouldn't be much higher in 2026.\n\nMcDaniel has been able to make more from less, turning around a team that looked absolutely cooked to start the season (1-6) en route to a .500-ish record. That's happened without Tyreek Hill in the lineup and followed the benching of Tua Tagovailoa. Rookie seventh round pick Quinn Ewers may not be the team's future, but McDaniel installed an offense around him that allowed him to beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 17 to further dim the Bucs' Super Bowl hopes.\n\nThat's all encouraging. It does not change the fact McDaniel failed to make Tagovailoa more than a fantasy football star, an 0-2 playoff record or a 9-14 record in December or later. The unconventional head coach has done a great job adding a slick layer of sheen atop his franchise that begins to flake apart under modest scrutiny. He's had one season with a top 20 scoring defense. He hasn't cracked the top 20 in scoring offense either of the last two years.\n\nLike Gannon above, McDaniel's franchise is on the verge of swapping out a once-touted, highly paid and since-benched quarterback in service of a fresh start. But Tagovailoa's contract, injury history and the smoldering crater his 2025 play created makes him considerably more difficult to trade and there's nearly $100 million worth of dead salary attached to the $212 million extension he signed in (deep exhale) 2024. Miami isn't bad enough to land a top prospect on an inexpensive salary in the draft. Its best option may be hoping for a Sam Darnold or Baker Mayfield-type revival from a journeyman veteran.\n\nThat could benefit McDaniel, who supercharged Tagovailoa just long enough to be an albatross around the team's neck and just won a game with a seventh round rookie behind center. McDaniel's place in Kyle Shanahan's coaching tree suggests a special appreciation for getting the most out of flawed passers. But four seasons of underwhelming returns and no playoff success to speak of may shuffle him back to the coordinator ranks for a few years instead.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: 6 NFL coaches on the hot seat for Black Monday",

    "fullText": "Inter Milan manager Cristian Chivu is reportedly considering a significant midfield adjustment as Piotr Zielinski rediscovers his top form.\n\nAccording to Gazzetta dello Sport via FCInter1908, the Nerazzurri could play with two playmakers from now on.\n\nHakan Calhanoglu has been Inter’s deep-lying playmaker for years, nailing down the role as his own.\n\nIndeed, the 31-year-old Turkish star has been phenomenal since joining the club from AC Milan in 2021.\n\nFurthermore, Simone Inzaghi’s decision to deploy him deeper in midfield has allowed Calhanoglu to dictate play with greater control\n\nLEVERKUSEN, GERMANY – DECEMBER 10: Piotr Zielinski of FC Internazionale runs with the ball during the UEFA Champions League 2024/25 League Phase MD6 match between Bayer 04 Leverkusen and FC Internazionale Milano at BayArena on December 10, 2024 in Leverkusen, Germany. (Photo by Lars Baron/Getty Images)\n\nDespite Calhanoglu’s consistency, Inter could add another playmaker to their starting lineup.\n\nIt’s none other than Zielinski.\n\nFollowing a dreadful first season at San Siro, Zielinski has hit the ground running under Cristian Chivu.\n\nIndeed, the Polish midfielder has been in scintillating form this term, leapfrogging Henrikh Mkhitaryan in the pecking order.\n\nMoreover, Zielinski’s playmaking skills and technical prowess are well-documented.\n\nTherefore, he can perfectly co-exist with Calhanoglu on the pitch, offering Inter more creativity and fluidity in the final third.",

    "description": "New York Giants interim head coach Mike Kafka: \"I don't have any doubts\" that Jaxson Dart is a franchise quarterback.",
    "fullText": "New York Giants interim head coach Mike Kafka offered glowing praise for rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart on Monday, declaring unequivocally that the young signal-caller has already established himself as the team's franchise quarterback.\n\n\"I don't have any doubts about that,\" Kafka said when asked if he believes Dart is a legitimate NFL franchise quarterback.\n\nDart, who entered the season as the backup before taking over as a starter, has impressed Kafka with his natural leadership that extends beyond the offense.\n\n\"I've seen Jaxson just become more comfortable in that role,\" Kafka said. \"It's not about forcing anything, it's just about being himself and leading the way that he sees it and bringing guys along with him. Those are the qualities that we've seen since the first day he's gotten here.\"\n\nKafka noted that Dart's influence has reached the defense, with players there citing his leadership.\n\n\"I don't think there's an age requirement for leadership, whether you're young or old or a veteran or one year or one month or however many,\" Kafka said. \"I just think if you have the leadership qualities, if you have the ability to, number one, lead yourself and then lead others, and guys will follow you based on how you operate and how you carry yourself, then I don't think there's necessarily like a prerequisite for that.\n\n\"I mean, Jaxson does a great job because he's just being himself and he's controlling what he can control. He's doing all the things that make him great and he's just being himself. He's not trying to be somebody else. He's just his genuine self.\"\n\nOn Dart's development, Kafka highlighted the typical leap from Year 1 to Year 2.\n\n\"I think you learn so much faster from year one to year two. You have that full season, you're in the NFL style, you kind of know how things operate. You've built somewhat of a framework of a routine on how you want to prepare yourself,\" he said. \"Now you have time after this season to go through, kind of refine the things that you want, how you want to operate in the offseason, and now you have some time to kind of look back and really dissect yourself and really can make some more steps to improvement.\"\n\nKafka, who has coached Dart since his rookie arrival, called him \"a pleasure to coach.\"\n\n\"He's been awesome. Learning every single day, absorbing as much information as he can, and then also putting his own fingerprint on things,\" he said. \"You see a player that's continuing to learn from the good, the bad, and then continuing to take steps forward... take ownership and take accountability and hold other guys accountable.\"\n\n\"I'm proud to be working with him and happy for him, and I'm excited to continue to do that,\" Kafka concluded.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Giants' Mike Kafka doesn't 'have any doubt' Jaxson Dart is a franchise QB",

He added a two-point performance Monday night to help beat Slovakia 6-5 in an exhilarating preliminary contest.\n\nZellers was a 2024 Colorado Avalanche draft pick, but found his way to the Bruins farm as a part of the deal that sent away Charlie Coyle.\n\nHe had an assist earlier in the contest, and his third-period goal put the game out of reach, securing the win for the USA.\n\nWill Zellers (@UNDmhockey | @NHLBruins) cannot stop scoring for @usahockey, his fourth of the tournament!\n\n📺: #WorldJuniors on NHL Network https://t.co/NTSMKsiFrB pic.twitter.com/TUpavW4cLX\n\n— NHL Media (@NHLMedia) December 30, 2025\n\nZellers and Team USA would not have been in a position to win the game had it not been for the offensive contributions of Bruins draft pick James Hagens.\n\nHagens plays at Boston College and was the Bruins’ seventh-overall selection in the 2025 NHL Draft.\n\nThe 19-year-old centers the first line winged by Zellers and scored two of the United States’ six goals, including this one from the point to tie the game at four heading into the second intermission.\n\nJames Hagens (@BC_MHockey | @NHLBruins) will not be denied, he ties it up for @usahockey in the final minute!\n\n📺: #WorldJuniors on NHL Network https://t.co/P4MrNIzKOs pic.twitter.com/BOKLGivD3m\n\n— NHL Media (@NHLMedia) December 30, 2025\n\nTeam USA is back in action on Wednesday against undefeated Sweden in the final game of the preliminary round.\n\nAll games are airing on the NHL Network.\n\nFormer Bruins Star Linus Ullmark Takes Leave Of Absence For ‘Personal Reasons’",

He added that the midfielder “never had anyone at Brighton get at him” and “just handled every situation well”.\n\nTroy Deeney’s BBC Team of the Week for Matchweek 18\n\nThe schedule is so packed at the moment that there’s barely time for the Premier League and the BBC to put out one Team of the Week because the next round of fixtures gets underway.

    "fullText": "Liverpool have parted ways with first-team set-piece coach Aaron Briggs as the Premier League champions move to address a persistent weakness that has undermined their performances this season.\n\nThe decision follows mounting frustration inside the club over Liverpool’s record at dead-ball situations, which has been among the poorest in the division despite their continued strength in open play.\n\nSet pieces have proven costly for Arne Slot’s side, with Liverpool conceding 12 goals from such situations in the Premier League, more than any other top-flight team when penalties are excluded.\n\nOnly West Ham United have conceded more goals from corners, while Liverpool have allowed seven from that specific source alone.\n\nAt the other end of the pitch, their returns have been similarly underwhelming, with Liverpool scoring just 2.4 goals per 100 set pieces, a figure bettered only by Brentford from the wrong end of the scale.\n\nIn terms of defensive output, Liverpool are conceding 8.2 goals per 100 set pieces, with only Nottingham Forest posting a worse average.\n\nThose issues have repeatedly altered the course of matches, most recently against Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers, when Liverpool led comfortably before conceding from set pieces and being forced into tense finishes.\n\nBriggs joined Liverpool’s coaching staff in July 2024, initially as an individual development coach following the departure of Vitor Matos, before assuming responsibility for set pieces after the club were unable to appoint a specialist.\n\nThe appointment was adjusted last summer when Brazilian coach Luiz Fernando Iubel arrived as individual lead coach, allowing Briggs to focus solely on dead-ball situations, but the changes failed to produce the desired improvement.\n\nDespite his reputation as a diligent and respected coach, Liverpool concluded that a change was required midway through the campaign, although the club do not view his departure as a complete solution to the problem.\n\nThere is no immediate replacement lined up, with Briggs’ duties set to be shared among existing members of Slot’s coaching staff in the short term.\n\nBriggs arrived at Anfield after working under Niko Kovac at Wolfsburg and previously held senior analytical and coaching roles at Monaco.\n\nHe also spent nine years at Manchester City, progressing from under-18 performance analyst to a senior first-team role, with earlier experience at Blackpool and Preston North End.",

    "fullText": "Barcelona returned to training yesterday after a short festive break, and the mood around the squad is one of focus rather than celebration.\n\nWith momentum on their side, the challenge now is to carry that form into what promises to be one of the most demanding starts to a calendar year in recent memory.\n\nTo put the scale of the challenge into context, the team will not play a single match at home until the end of January.\n\nIn fact, Barça’s first six fixtures of the new year will all be away from home, a schedule that leaves little room for error.\n\nTheir competitive return begins with a derby against Espanyol on January 3 and just days later, Barcelona travel again for the Spanish Super Cup semi-final against Athletic Club on January 7.\n\nThe month continues with another difficult league assignment away to Real Sociedad on January 18, followed by a UEFA Champions League clash against Slavia Prague on January 21.\n\nBarcelona have a tough run of games in January. (Photo by Angel Martinez/Getty Images)\n\nTwo additional fixtures could further complicate the schedule, notably, a potential Super Cup final on January 11 and a Copa del Rey round of 16 tie, scheduled between January 13 and 15.\n\nThe first match of 2026 at the Spotify Camp Nou will not arrive until the weekend of January 24–25, when Real Oviedo pay a visit. This would be a match where Camp Nou could host a bigger audience.\n\nBarcelona will eventually close January with another home fixture, which is the final Champions League group match against Copenhagen on January 28.\n\nThere is, however, one big concern. Almost all of Barcelona’s defeats this season have come away from home.\n\nAside from the 1–2 loss to Paris Saint-Germain, every setback has occurred on the road, including league defeats to Sevilla and Real Madrid, as well as a Champions League loss to Chelsea.\n\nThis is why January represents a defining moment.",

However, the first-year captain is beginning to make a habit of throwing a block.\n\nThe quarterback told the “WEEI Afternoons” crew in a previous radio spot that he was not proud of his blocking efforts.\n\nHe was asked the same question on Monday, and Maye did his best to calm the nerves of anxious fans.\n\n“Yeah, I don’t know what do y’all think?” Maye asked. “I thought I was alright, got in the way enough.”\n\nThe host then asked if Maye is ever worried that one of the opposing defenders is going to “light you up.”\n\n“I mean, I’m 230 pounds, 6’5″, I think it’s a little harder to light me up than you think,” Maye said.\n\n\"I'm 230 pounds, 6'5.

One lucky fan in attendance will also receive £60,000 from the tournament sponsor, as will Prostate Cancer UK.\n\nWhat is dartitis and what causes it?\n\nLittler entered as favourite off the back of winning six major finals in 2025.\n\nLuke Humphries, Littler's predecessor as both world champion and world number one, faced Littler in three finals this year and is the current world number two.\n\nWorld number three Michael van Gerwen is also in the mix, looking to avenge last year's final defeat and add to his three world titles, with his most recent coming in 2019.\n\nYoung players making a big run at the World Championship include Josh Rock and Gian van Veen, whose respective form saw them both enter the world's top 12 before the tournament.\n\nBeau Greaves topped this year's Women's Series and carried the highest hopes of becoming only the second female player to win a match in the tournament, after Fallon Sherrock won twice at the event in December 2019.\n\nShe took 22nd seed Daryl Gurney to a deciding set but just fell short of a place in the second round.\n\nThree qualification places were on offer from the Women's Series, along with a spot for the Women's Matchplay winner, a title taken by Lisa Ashton.\n\nAshton lost 3-0 to 2023 world champion Michael Smith in the first round on 11 December.\n\nWith Greaves qualifying in her own right as runner-up on the development tour, that meant Women's Series runner-up Sherrock, Noa-Lynn van Leuven in fourth and Gemma Hayter, who finished fifth, joined third-placed Ashton.\n\nVan Leuven, who became the first transgender player to appear at the tournament last year, was beaten by two-time champion Peter Wright this time.\n\nSherrock lost in straight sets in the first round to Dave Chisnall, while Hayter took a set off Northern Ireland's World Cup winner Rock in a 3-1 defeat.\n\nThe format is set play, unlike other tournaments which are a race to a number of legs.\n\nA set consists of the best of five legs or race to three.\n\nOnly in matches where players are level on sets and legs in the deciding set do players need to win by two clear legs.\n\nFirst and second round: Best of five sets\n\nThird and fourth round: Best of seven sets\n\nQuarter-finals: Best of nine sets\n\nPhil Taylor is the most successful player in the history of the PDC World Darts Championship, winning 14 of his 16 world titles between 1995 and 2013.\n\nHis previous two titles came before a group of leading players broke away from the British Darts Organisation to form their own governing body, now known as the PDC, in 1993.\n\nThe past five years have produced five different world champions, with English trio Littler, Humphries and Smith winning the past three.\n\nLittler and Humphries will hope to join the exclusive club of players to have won multiple PDC world titles, with only six managing to achieve that feat so far.\n\nTwo players hit nine-darters during the 2025 World Darts Championship.\n\nDutchman Christian Kist was the first player to hit one, doing so in a first-round defeat by Madars Razma.\n\nAustralia's Damon Heta hit one in the third round, but like Kist it came in a defeat as he went out to Luke Woodhouse.\n\nThroughout the tournament, there will be daily round-ups on the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nThere will also be live text coverage of the biggest matches as the tournament progresses.\n\nDuring Thursday's opening night, there was a dedicated preview show on BBC Radio 5 Live, featuring interviews with Littler, Humphries and Van Gerwen. Presenter James Gregg will provide updates on BBC Sounds throughout the competition.\n\nThis article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.\n\nAsk Me Anything is a service dedicated to answering your questions.\n\nWe want to reward your time by telling you things you do not know and reminding you of things you do.\n\nThe team will find out everything you need to know and be able to call upon a network of contacts including our experts and pundits.\n\nWe will be answering your questions from the heart of the BBC Sport newsroom, and going behind the scenes at some of the world's biggest sporting events.\n\nOur coverage will span the BBC Sport website, app, social media and YouTube accounts, plus BBC TV and radio.\n\nHow do darts world rankings work?\n\nWho is Arsenal teenager Salmon?\n\nWhy is Steve Smith wearing black tape under his eyes?\n\nWhen is the FA Cup third round draw?",

    "fullText": "Negotiations between Milan and Fenerbahce for Christopher Nkunku have begun, but while the Rossoneri are only open to discussing a permanent transfer, the French forward seems unwilling to leave San Siro in January.\n\nFenerbahçe have opened formal talks to sign Milan striker Nkunku in the January transfer window, according to multiple sources, including Gazzetta and Turkish transfer expert Yağız Sabuncuoğlu.\n\nMILAN, ITALY – NOVEMBER 02: Christopher Nkunku of AC Milan runs with the ball whilst under pressure from Wesley Franca of AS Roma during the Serie A match between AC Milan and AS Roma at Giuseppe Meazza Stadium on November 02, 2025 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\nAccording to Calciomercato.com, the Turkish club are open to matching Milan’s €35m asking price, but don’t want to include Milan Skriniar in the deal.\n\nThe Rossoneri have sounded out the ex-Inter centre-back, but Fenerbahce don’t want to sell their defensive leader. Milan, on the other hand, will only discuss a permanent transfer for Nkunku.\n\nMILAN, ITALY – SEPTEMBER 23: Christopher Nkunku of AC Milan inflates a balloon as he celebrates with teammates after scoring to give the side a 2-0 lead during the Coppa Italia Frecciarossa Round of 16 match between AC Milan and US Lecce at Giuseppe Meazza Stadium on September 23, 2025 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Jonathan Moscrop/Getty Images)\n\nFenerbahce would need to convince Nkunku as well, given that several sources, including Ben Jacobs and Gianluca Di Marzio, say that the ex-Chelsea forward wants to stay at Milan next month, having joined the Serie A giants only a few months ago.",

    "description": "FaZe Clan's influencer exodus exposes a key risk for creator-economy companies that rely directly on talent to make money.",
    "fullText": "The creator economy gives, and it can also take — suddenly. That's one lesson behind the abrupt exodus of talent from the esports and marketing company FaZe Clan last week.\n\nBuilding a business led by an influencer or celebrity can make you a boatload of money. Just ask the teams behind Kim Kardashian's Skims or George Clooney's Casamigos tequila, which both crossed $1 billion in value.\n\nBut starting a company where the product you're selling is the influencer — such that you make money primarily from their social-media reach, content, or ability to do brand deals — can be risky.\n\nIf a YouTuber or TikTok creator loses popularity due to a scandal or a sudden algorithm change, the revenue dries up. If they become burned out from posting or simply decide they no longer want to work with an intermediary company, then poof!\n\nThat's the situation FaZe Clan appears to have found itself in this week after all six creators its website listed as its talent roster announced they were leaving the company in separate posts on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nCompany investor Matt Kalish, who cofounded DraftKings, told Bloomberg that the current financial structure of FaZe Clan is \"unsustainable\" and he had offered talent the option to go independent or sign deals with his company, HardScope, which they declined.\n\nFaZe Clan acknowledged the departures in its own post on X, writing that \"this era of FaZe\" had \"come to a close.\" With its most famous talent gone and their millions of followers in tow, the company is leaning into its esports business that makes money from league participation, player transfer fees, and IP licensing.\n\nFounded in 2010, FaZe Clan started as a group of friends who enjoyed making gaming videos. The group amassed millions of fans and began making revenue through brand deals. FaZe Clan went public in 2022, sharing in investor filings that it pulled in tens of millions of dollars in revenue from brand sponsorships and other advertising tied to its content. Other business lines, such as consumer products or esports, represented a smaller piece of the pie.\n\nFaZe Clan, when it was still reporting its revenue sources as a public company in 2022 and 2023, relied heavily on brand deals and YouTube ads to make money.\n\nFaZe Clan's stock plummeted in value during its first year trading on the Nasdaq. After cutting about 20% of its staff in early 2023, the company sold itself to gaming and marketing firm GameSquare in March 2024. GameSquare later sold FaZe Clan's media business in multiple transactions to Kalish and others, while retaining the esports business.\n\nThe sudden departure of FaZe's creators — and its struggle in recent years — highlights a key risk that should keep any creator-economy CEO up at night. Being overly reliant on specific creators or revenue sources can be a ticking time bomb.\n\nThe solution: diversify, diversify, diversify.\n\nFaZe Clan, GameSquare, and HardScope did not respond to requests for comment.",

    "description": "Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol said a fictional café — Central Perk from \"Friends\" — guided his vision of what his stores should look like.",
    "fullText": "Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol wants his cafés to feel like Central Perk from the TV show 'Friends.'\n\nDuring an interview with The Wall Street Journal, released Monday, Niccol spoke about his \"Back to Starbucks\" plan, a yearlong process of turning around the brand after several quarters of declining sales amid a deteriorating customer experience.\n\nHe told Alan Murray, president of The WSJ Leadership Institute, that the name \"Back to Starbucks\" helped to give his baristas a \"visual understanding\" of the café experience he was trying to achieve.\n\n\"Because everybody remembers a 'Friends' episode, or that coffee house experience, by me saying 'Back to Starbucks,' that kind of hearkens that memory of what I would call the barista-customer connection that we're after,\" Niccol said.\n\nThe coffee shop from the 'Friends,' Central Perk, was a pivotal set piece throughout the sitcom's 10-season run. Almost every episode featured the café as the characters' favorite haunt.\n\nThe cast was often filmed sitting on Central Perk's mismatched sofas and chairs, ordering coffee and baked goods, and making small talk with the awkward manager, Gunther.\n\nNiccol's comparison of Central Perk to Starbucks comes after he spent more than a year rebranding Starbucks, from what customers and employees said was a soulless conglomerate chain, to a warm and inviting third place. He took the top job in September 2024.\n\nHe simplified the menu, introduced more seating and tables in the cafés, offered free coffee and tea refills, brought back the condiment station and ceramic mugs, and encouraged baristas to write small notes on coffee cups to interact with their customers.\n\nHowever, its sales have yet to see a strong recovery.

    "description": "Doctors are seeing colon cancer in people in their 20s and 30s. New research suggests it starts in infancy.",
    "fullText": "Five years ago, Tim Cannon, a cancer doctor in Virginia, saw that his colon cancer patients were getting younger and their cancer was more aggressive. He had just diagnosed three people in their 30s with late-stage colon cancer. More perplexing, all three were athletes who competed in long-distance, endurance sports.\n\n\"Within a six-month period, I saw three extreme athletes in their 30s with metastatic, very advanced, incurable colon cancer,\" Cannon told Business Insider.\n\nCannon had a hunch that this pattern wasn't an anomaly. He examined 100 more long-distance runners between 35 and 50 years old and found that 39 had developed precancerous tumors in their colons. Fifteen of those cases were advanced — far more than the expected 1.2%. Nearly one-sixth of all the runners were at risk of developing colon cancer. It was startling.\n\nCannon's research, which is still in its early stages, points to broader questions that have confounded the medical community: Why are so many young, fit adults getting sick and dying from colon and rectal cancer? And why are these patients — people who are younger than 45, the age at which screening is first recommended — getting the most aggressive forms of the disease?\n\n\"The steepest rise is in people in their 20s and 30s,\" said Dr. Kimmie Ng, director of Dana-Farber's Young-Onset Colorectal Cancer Center. \"They're younger, they're healthier, they don't have comorbidities, they get more treatment — and yet they're not living longer.\"\n\nIn January, Business Insider reported on the leading scientific theories for why people with clean diets get colon cancer. Possible answers ranged from microplastics to antibiotics. Leading theories generally pinpointed the modern diet, including too much sugar, and other facts of modern life, like staring into the blue light of our phones late at night, which can disrupt our natural rhythms.\n\nThese factors are likely part of the picture, oncologists say. But there's more to explore. Clusters of early-onset cancers like the one that Cannon says he identified are helping us gain a better understanding of the disease — and some answers for what ordinary people can do about it.\n\nCancer researchers are discovering how different environmental factors interact with our systems in complex ways and at different points of our development.\n\nAnd they're increasingly zeroing in on the first year of life — from birth itself to our first months out of the womb — for answers about young cancer.\n\nSome early research is scratching at the idea that a vulnerability to colorectal cancer could start in infancy — suggesting the first months and years of life could be a key window for intervention.\n\nAt UC San Diego, molecular biologist Ludmil Alexandrov recently identified a mutational signature in more than half of colorectal tumors found in patients under 40 that appears to be caused by colibactin, a toxin produced by a specific strain of E. coli.\n\nWhat startled researchers was the timing of the damage. Cancer researchers typically find DNA damage building up in the adult body. Smoking, grilling meats, work like mining or asbestos-spraying — these well-trodden cancer triggers are typically ignited when our DNA is already becoming more decrepit and unstable, with time and age.\n\nHere — according to the paper Alexandrov published in Nature in April — the infection had occurred before babies reached their ninth month of life.\n\nAlexandrov's research, while preliminary, suggests infants can be hit with DNA mutations just months into their lives that might leave them predisposed to developing cancer within a few decades.\n\n\"You get your first hit at age 1 instead of age 30,\" Alexandrov said. \"So you are about 20 to 30 years ahead of schedule for cancer.\"\n\n\"Something that happened at age 6 months,\" Alexandrov added, \"you don't even consider when you're 35.\"\n\n\"That disconnect is extremely problematic.\"\n\nIf Alexandrov's finding is confirmed in bigger studies, it could reframe the mystery of early-onset colorectal cancer. The rise could be rooted in early life, with early adulthood simply being the point at which the long incubation period finally comes to a head.\n\nIf colibactin infections are a major early trigger, the most effective strategy may be preventing that mutational DNA damage in the first place. The next generation of cancer prevention may involve targeted microbial restoration and dietary strategies designed for an infant's developing immune system. Alexandrov envisions targeted probiotics for infants that neutralize colibactin-producing bacteria.\n\n\"If we can monitor the mutations and see that the ones exposed to the probiotic don't appear,\" he said, it could mean \"we're eliminating the cause.\"\n\nNg says Alexandrov's findings \"cement a role of the microbiome in this disease.\"\n\nShifts in how babies eat, including more ultra-processed food and fewer fiber-rich ingredients, could drive up colibactin infection rates.\n\nWhile researchers suspect that colibactin infections in infants have been on the rise in recent decades, there isn't enough data yet to say for sure. More study is also needed to confirm the link of any such rise to colon cancer.\n\nIt's not just diet that could be playing a role in the rise. Researchers are also looking at shifting trends in how babies are born.\n\nOur first moments of life are a pivotal training ground for the gut — a baby's welcome party to our diverse world of bacteria, fungi, and viruses.\n\nBabies born vaginally pass through the birth canal and pick up critical microbial communities from their mothers — microbes that help train the immune system. C-section babies start life with different microbes, and the evidence is mounting that these early differences may have an impact.\n\n\"There is strong evidence that early-life microbial disruption can influence long-term health risk,\" said Dr. Maria Gloria Domínguez-Bello, a professor at Rutgers University who has pioneered infant microbiome research and looked at the links between an infant's microbiome and their risk for adult diseases, including IBS, ulcerative colitis, and colon cancer.\n\nShe noted that modern changes to birth and feeding practices may lead to subtle yet consequential disruptions to the microbiome.\n\nIn 2016, Domínguez-Bello launched a landmark study on \"vaginal seeding\" — taking babies born via C-section and coating them with bacteria from the mother's vaginal canal. It will be years before we know the effectiveness of this approach, but the hope is that this small intervention may have bolstered their microbiome from day one.\n\nBreastfeeding is one of the ways infants acquire early protective microbes. Breastmilk is packed with complex sugars — human milk oligosaccharides — that babies' gut bacteria can feed on, shaping the early immune system. It can also contain traces of what the mother ingests or has been exposed to.\n\nMultiple large-scale studies have found that the gut bacteria of formula-fed babies tend to differ from those of breastfed babies. While questions remain, this research is reshaping the infant formula market.\n\nCompanies like Biomilq and Helaina are developing \"microbiome-friendly\" formulas that contain synthetic versions of the complex sugars found in breastmilk. Early clinical trials show these products can nudge a baby's gut bacteria to look more breastfed, though whether that matters decades later remains unknown. Still, these formulas have become one of the fastest-growing segments of the infant nutrition industry.\n\nConsuming too much sugar is emerging as a key culprit that may be shaping what happens to our microbiome.\n\nNg's group has found that sugary diets — especially sugary drinks including soda, juice, and sports drinks — are associated with a higher risk of early-onset colon cancer. Food that spikes insulin or glucose \"is linked with a higher risk of colorectal cancer,\" too, she said.\n\nDr. Andrea Cercek at Memorial Sloan Kettering noticed something else: Among her youngest patients with stage 4 cancer, sugar consumption stood out. \"There were slight differences in risk factors — and sugars in particular,\" Cercek said. The idea aligns with prior studies showing that fructose can accelerate polyp growth in animal models.\n\nIt doesn't mean sugar \"causes\" cancer. But modern, ultra-high levels of sugar intake may be accelerating disease in people whose risk was primed early. And they're crowding out what people once used to balance out sugar's effect on the body, improving blood sugar and aiding digestion at the same time: fiber.\n\nSugar can be great for a quick burst of energy, but in the long run, we need fiber to slow it down and promote good gut health. This is especially true of resistant starch (beans, lentils, oats), the type that ferments in the gut and produces short-chain fatty acids that suppress inflammation.\n\nDr. Stephen O'Keefe, who studies Alaska Native communities with historically high colorectal cancer rates, recently found that adding a resistant starch supplement to people's diets for just four weeks had measurable effects.\n\n\"The supplementation did suppress cancer biomarkers,\" he said, discussing the findings he presented to colleagues at Digestive Disease Week 2025.\n\n\"A high fiber diet produces metabolites that suppress colon cancer risk,\" he said. \"A high saturated meat diet produces metabolites that are inflammatory and carcinogenic.\"\n\nHe's seen this kind of thing before, noting important, negative microbial changes occurred quite rapidly when he fed rural, bean-eating South Africans typical American foods like hamburgers and hash browns for two weeks.\n\nO'Keefe believes increasing fiber intake could meaningfully offset other dietary risks, and perhaps reshape the microbiome in protective ways.\n\nOnce researchers began looking beyond diet, they started interrogating other environmental changes as possible multipliers of an individual's risk of colorectal cancer.\n\nArtificial light at night — particularly from phones — disrupts circadian rhythms that regulate DNA repair. Long periods of sitting can slow gut motility and increase inflammation. Air pollution inflames the gut lining and introduces carcinogenic particles directly to the colon.\n\nThese aren't \"causes\" in isolation. But, together with nutrition and metabolism, they can disrupt how genes operate. Over time, these changes can trigger more disease.\n\nThis is the focus of Dr. Heinz-Josef Lenz's research at the University of Southern California Cancer Center. As a gastroenterologist, he has been troubled by a rise in young Latino men developing colon cancer in high school and college — many of them are athletic and healthy with no known risk factors. Lenz says their higher-than-average occurrence of young colon cancer is not due to any particular genetics.\n\n\"What can it be when it's not genetic? It could be epigenetic,\" he said. \"Meaning, what you do, what you eat, what you drink, and related to your parents — how they acted and behaved.\"\n\nAlready, he's seeing clues that young Latino athletes with colon cancer might be suffering from nutritional changes that span multiple generations, based on changes that are inherited.\n\nFor one 15-year-old in Los Angeles, it's possible that a daily Gatorade is enough to promote tumor growth in the colon, while for someone else with a different background, it's not such a big deal.\n\nThough Lenz has seen some interesting data on fructose pathways that appear dysregulated in young colon cancer patients, he is cautious to point out that nothing has emerged that is definitively an \"it\" cancer-causer just yet.\n\n\"The data should be becoming available in the next one or two years,\" he said.\n\nThe hope is that, with time and some more research, Lenz will be able to better tailor treatments to a patient's genetics and background, making each one more effective.\n\nOne promising target is the circadian rhythm, or a person's body clock. Lenz recently teamed up with top body clock researcher Dr. Steve Kay to examine the effects of manipulating the body clock on cancer treatment.\n\n\"What we found is that some circadian clock proteins our lab has been researching for many years are the 'gas pedal' to cancer,\" Kay said in a press release. \"Out of that came a whole set of experiments that started to really blow all of us away. Drugs that my lab developed to target the circadian clock showed they could kill colorectal cancer cells.\"\n\nFor oncologists, the rise in young cases is not just a scientific challenge. Young patients often arrive confused and ashamed because they believe cancer is strongly associated with their own lifestyle choices.\n\nCannon says this misconception adds to the pain. \"The public understands cancer as more related to personal behavior than oncologists do,\" he said. \"You don't have total control over this, as far as I can tell.\"\n\nAll of the researchers we spoke to for this story cautioned that people shouldn't misinterpret this emerging science as a lifestyle playbook just yet.\n\nThey did encourage some lifestyle modifications. This includes more fiber, less sugar, more movement, and better sleep.\n\nWhen it comes to the extreme athletes Cannon is studying, his own leading hypothesis is that the stress of extreme endurance training might starve intestinal tissue of oxygen and create more opportunities for cancerous mutations. His research is far from conclusive. \"The theories are all over the place,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't want to overstate how much you can control this with any behavior,\" he said. \"In the end, it's still a chance event.\"",

    "title": "Backyard tiny homes are finally legal in New York City. They could be a boon for homeowners who can afford construction.",
    "description": "The NYC government has begun accepting applications from homeowners who want to build an ADU, including a backyard tiny home, on their property.",
    "fullText": "It's open season for some New York City homeowners interested in building a tiny home in their backyard.\n\nUnder a sweeping zoning reform Mayor Eric Adams signed into law late last year, the city made it legal for certain one- and two-family homeowners to add an additional home, also known as an \"ancillary dwelling unit\" or ADU, to their property.\n\nOn September 30, 2025, the city finalized its rules for backyard and attic ADUs and began accepting applications from homeowners, although the government is still working on the rules for basement units. The city estimates that the reform — part of its City of Yes for Housing Opportunity package — will help create about 25,000 new homes in backyard cottages and converted garages, attics, and basements over the next 15 years. But the success of the reform will depend in large part on homeowners navigating high construction costs and regulations.\n\nWil Fisher has spent the last year preparing for this. The former city government employee founded a Queens-based firm, Unit Two Development, that helps homeowners determine whether their property is eligible for an ADU and connects them with contractors and others who can help them build one. Fisher said he and his team have identified well over 100,000 eligible individual properties, and they've talked with more than 100 of these homeowners, who largely live in Queens and Staten Island.\n\n\"The rules of the road are now written,\" Fisher said. \"It was a long process, but for the most part we're off to the races.\"\n\nMost of the people Fisher has talked with are interested in adding an ADU to house a family member, including an aging parent or a relative with disabilities who needs care, or an adult child.\n\nMaggie Ornstein is one of these homeowners. Ornstein, 47, lives with her mother in a house in western Queens that has been home to five generations of her family since the 1800s. She hopes to build an ADU for her mother, who's undergoing treatment for cancer and is having difficulty navigating the stairs in their two-and-a-half-story home.\n\nOrnstein, a public health geographer, has consulted with Fisher and determined that she could legally convert her garage into a home.\n\n\"My dream for an ADU on my property would be something that would be accessible, but might also have a second floor where a family member could potentially stay if they wanted to visit, or if I wanted to be with my mom in the ADU,\" she said.\n\nAfter months of planning and big picture discussions with potential clients, Fisher is starting to nail down the specifics of what his clients could build and what it might cost.\n\n\"Now is sort of the pivot from the conceptual to here's exactly what it will take, and here are the cost implications of that,\" he said.\n\nOne inevitable obstacle homeowners face is the steep price of building in the city. Fisher estimates that adding a backyard unit or converting a garage will start between $300,000 and $400,000, depending on the project's size. That's compared to the city's median home price of $800,000.\n\nThe construction cost is out of reach for many homeowners who'd benefit most from adding an ADU to their property, said Thomas Yu, executive director of Asian Americans for Equality, an advocacy organization and affordable housing provider. Yu said there needs to be a much clearer and more affordable path to adding an ADU before the regulatory reform will unleash construction in lower and middle-income neighborhoods. He suggested tax abatements or grants for homeowners with more modest means.\n\nMany of the New Yorkers Yu and his team work with live in overcrowded homes with multiple generations of their family. They could benefit from having a home for an older relative or an adult child who couldn't otherwise afford to stay in the city.\n\n\"The ability for that generation to achieve independent homeownership is zero, particularly in New York City,\" Yu said of younger New Yorkers. \"So ADUs are the next half-step that's needed for that.\"\n\nOrnstein said she's been discouraged by the price tag on her potential project. She's also turned off by how extensive and involved the construction would likely be, especially given her work schedule and caregiving responsibilities. She's hoping to find some government funding to help pay for the project.\n\n\"It's so much more expensive than I would have anticipated,\" she said. \"On the one hand, you wouldn't be able to buy an apartment in New York City for what an ADU would cost to build. But on the other, it's really a lot of upfront cost.\"\n\nThe expense and hassle of adding an ADU might not make sense for homeowners who are just looking for rental income, Fisher said. But he expects the units will be easily rentable for those who want a tenant either immediately or in the future. Adding an ADU also tends to hike the property's resale value.\n\n\"As far as I'm seeing, construction costs are a little too high for them to be a slam dunk rental investment from day one,\" Fisher said. \"But for folks who have a relative or an immediate need that exists within their own family or social network, these are going to be good investments in the long term.\"\n\nADU construction is also limited by a slew of regulations. The units can't be bigger than 800 square feet or take up more than a third of a homeowner's backyard. The law also restricts basement ADUs in areas prone to flooding and prohibits them in attached homes, like townhouses.\n\nThe Regional Plan Association, a pro-housing nonprofit focused on the tri-state area, found that just 68,000 lots — 12% of the city's one- and two-family properties — are eligible to add an ADU.\n\nThe city says it's creating a \"one-stop shop\" full of information for homeowners interested in building an additional unit. The site will include a set of public, pre-approved backyard ADU designs submitted by architects, designers, and builders that homeowners can use to lower design costs and speed up the construction process.\n\n\"Efficiencies that can be built in are really going to be make or break for this market,\" Fisher said.",

    "description": "Rodin Roohipour is a 15-year-old interested in tech and venture capital. To learn about the industry, he cold emails business leaders for advice.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Rodin Roohipour, a 15-year-old from Los Angeles. It's been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider verified the email correspondences mentioned.\n\nI've wanted to start a company since I was 12.\n\nWhen I was younger, at 8, I loved building things. I started coding very early. Then I turned 12, I did this entrepreneurship program, and I got really into it. I kept trying to build these companies, these little side projects, but nothing took off.\n\nEventually, I realized a really important thing you need to have is knowledge. I knew nothing about tech or venture capital. I decided to learn everything the best way I could, which is by talking to the most knowledgeable people.\n\nThat led me to all these cold emails.\n\nThe biggest names were Alfred Lin from Sequoia Capital, Mark Cuban, Paul Graham. They've given so much good advice.\n\nWhen I emailed Alfred Lin, I had to follow up three times. I asked him what his issues were in venture capital.\n\nI emailed Julia Lipton from Awesome People Ventures, and she responded three weeks after my follow-up and seemed happy to chat. She was the first big person I ever called with.\n\nWhen I emailed Mark Cuban, I really had to personalize it. This guy gets like 500 emails a day. You have to stand out. I said: \"I'm currently a high school student who uses Al a LOT and went to your bootcamp a while back.\" That captured his attention.\n\nA lot of people are like, \"Can you get on a meeting?\" You need to go in with no expectations. You should just share your story and say, \"One sentence of advice would help.\"\n\nA lot of people hide the interesting parts about themselves because they think that it'll scare people off. In my first few emails, I talked like a salesman. It sounds super professional, but the problem with that is, it sounds like a sales pitch. It'll go to your promotions folder.\n\nYou need to use the extreme or unusual attributes around you.\n\nI view an email as two parts: the subject and the body. The subject is what you're using to get someone to open it. You don't need to explain anything. You don't need to introduce yourself.\n\nThe subject line I've been using a lot is: \"writing this email to you while in my high school math class.\" It's a bit generic, so if you're emailing someone like Mark Cuban, you would change it. But it works really well. (I don't actually write the emails in my math class. I just schedule them for the morning.)\n\nIt's a pattern break. If all your emails are like \"I'm going to fix this\" or \"I'm going to do that,\" nobody cares. That subject line captures your eye. A 14-to-18-year-old? What's he doing in my inbox? Math class reinforces that.\n\nThe body of the email is where everything else happens. You present your real argument, why the person you're emailing is relevant, and why helping you makes sense for them.\n\nA clever subject line can't save a bad email. You'll have 500 opens but two replies.\n\nPaul Graham was one of the biggest emails I got. I told him, \"I'm Rodin, 14 y/o and super interested in VC and startups. I'm building a product that is a trust platform for VCs / founders. I would love to chat with you about your story and some problems you face. Even 10 mins would mean a lot.\"\n\nHe gave me a blunt reply, but it was nice. He told me: \"This is a mistake. You are much better off focusing on learning math and programming. Build your own LLM.\"\n\nEven if these people don't give you big replies, it's important that you're in their network. It builds a slight connection.",

    "description": "From Disney's $1 billion bet on OpenAI to a wave of blockbuster acquihires, these deals reshaped the tech industry in 2025.",
    "fullText": "While most of the industry was out of office over the holidays, Nvidia and SoftBank's deal teams were grinding.\n\nBoth companies chose the year's quietest stretch to drop news that was anything but: SoftBank said Monday it will acquire digital infrastructure investor DigitalBridge for about $4 billion.\n\nNvidia's move was stranger still. On Christmas Eve, it announced a \"non-exclusive licensing agreement\" with Groq, the startup behind custom chips designed to handle AI inference — the real-time work that powers chatbot replies. The companies did not disclose financial terms.\n\nWhile Nvidia didn't call it an acquisition, the guts of the arrangement looked familiar. Groq founder and CEO Jonathan Ross, along with top engineering staff, will head to Nvidia. Groq, last valued at $6.9 billion in a funding round three months ago, will continue to operate independently.\n\nIt's the latest example of a new kind of tech dealmaking, where the founder and key engineers get bought out, the technology gets siphoned off, and the startup itself is left in limbo.\n\nThat's the vibe of 2025: big, hairy deals that refuse to stay inside the lines.\n\nThe industry's biggest moves weren't just splashy acquisitions or eye-watering funding rounds. (We saw those deals, too.) They were sprawling, hard-to-categorize transactions. Money came tied to compute. Licensing came paired with talent raids. Infrastructure deals locked governments and corporate America into yearslong dependencies. These weren't neat mergers or simple checks. They were power grabs that shifted the balance of Silicon Valley and beyond.\n\nThese were the eight deals that defined the year in AI, ranked from smallest to largest by dollar value.\n\nNvidia ended the year doing the same thing that turned heads all year: extracting founders from their startups and leaving other employees to figure it out.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Nvidia announced it had entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Groq. The financial terms were undisclosed.\n\nUnder the agreement, Jonathan Ross, Groq's founder and CEO, as well as the startup's president and other team members, will join Nvidia, the world's most valuable company with a market capitalization of over $4.5 trillion.\n\nGroq will continue to operate as an independent company, with CFO Simon Edwards assuming the CEO role.\n\nDisney struck a three-year licensing agreement with OpenAI in December, becoming the first major content partner for Sora, OpenAI's video generator.\n\nThe deal isn't just about rights. Disney will invest $1 billion in OpenAI and receive warrants to buy additional equity — a structure that ties content, distribution, and upside together.\n\nBusiness Insider reporter Lucia Moses argues the logic can be summed up in one word: engagement. Time spent on Disney+ and other major streaming services has remained essentially flat in recent years, she writes, while YouTube and social video continue to grow.\n\nThe OpenAI partnership could help Disney meet audiences where they already are, by allowing fans to use tools like ChatGPT and Sora to generate and remix content featuring Disney characters.\n\nDeveloper coding assistant Windsurf was a startup Cinderella story. Then it became a cautionary tale.\n\nThe company was in talks to sell to OpenAI for $3 billion this past spring. The deal fell apart at the last minute.\n\nGoogle emerged as a new suitor. Instead of an outright acquisition, Google said it would pay $2.4 billion to hire its CEO and top talent, as well as license the company's intellectual property.\n\nThe deal effectively split Windsurf into two pieces, with the hundreds of remaining employees ending up at Cognition, another AI coding startup. That left some with a bitter taste.\n\nPart of the social contract in startups is that early employees work long hours at lower pay in the hope that they will share in the riches should their startup eventually get acquired or go public.\n\nNow, traditional acquisitions have become rarer because of the time and uncertainty of getting regulatory approval. As a result, companies like Google, Microsoft, and Meta have been getting creative, using licensing deals to skirt regulators and snap up key talent.\n\nSoftBank snapped up a private equity firm with the ultimate goal of controlling more of the physical infrastructure behind AI.\n\nOn Monday, SoftBank said it has entered into an agreement to acquire DigitalBridge, an alternative asset manager that invests in data centers, cell towers, fiber networks, and power that make the AI boom possible.\n\nThe transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2026, subject to regulatory approvals.\n\nThe deal comes as SoftBank reshuffles its portfolio. In November, the company said it had sold nearly $6 billion of Nvidia stock to free up cash for OpenAI. SoftBank is also doubling down on \"physical AI,\" building a robotics beachhead with a dedicated investment arm and a pending deal to buy ABB's robotics business.\n\nThe Trump administration agreed to take a 9.9% stake in Intel in August. It was a rare moment when Washington wasn't just regulating an industry or subsidizing it, but buying into it.\n\nUnder the terms Intel disclosed, the government will invest $8.9 billion for 433.3 million shares, and the stake is to be passive, with no board seat.\n\nThe investment aims to bolster domestic capacity for designing and manufacturing advanced chips. Intel has seen foreign competitors, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, cut into its market share of advanced chips. The White House has said it is a national security risk if industries continue to import the vast majority of advanced chips from overseas.\n\nThis also likely won't be the last deal of its kind. President Donald Trump and top aides have floated the idea of doing similar deals with American defense contractors and have considered a sovereign wealth fund.\n\nOne of the year's biggest deals sparked the question: Was Meta really spending $14 billion to hire a 28-year-old?\n\nAlexandr Wang cofounded and ran Scale AI, the data-labeling company that helps enterprises train and deploy AI models by supplying high-quality training data and tooling. In June, Meta agreed to pay $14.3 billion for a 49% stake in Scale AI — and, just as importantly, to bring Wang in to lead its next act in AI.\n\nWang became Meta's chief AI officer and the public face of its superintelligence push, with a mandate that goes well beyond building better chatbots. His job is to convince elite researchers that Meta is the place to do their life's work — and to turn the company's key advantage, its compute budget, into a lasting edge.\n\nWhen Google agreed to buy Israeli-American cloud security firm Wiz earlier this year, it threw a $32 billion bucket of water on the idea that the mega-deal drought would persist.\n\nIn March, Google agreed to acquire the startup at an all-cash price roughly equal to Iceland's gross domestic product last year, pending regulatory sign-off. This marks the search giant's largest acquisition.\n\nThe acquisition served as an early litmus test of the Trump administration's willingness to greenlight pricey Big Tech mergers and acquisitions. The deal passed an antitrust review by the Department of Justice in November, clearing a key hurdle to closing.\n\nTrump kicked off his second term by unveiling a joint venture with OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank to build a chain of data centers across the US — a project called Stargate that aims to invest $500 billion in domestic infrastructure by 2029.\n\nIn Abilene, Texas, a flagship data center has already opened. Construction crews have broken ground on Stargate sites in Lordstown, Ohio, and Port Washington, Wisconsin, with several more campuses to come.\n\nTo make the ongoing buildout a success, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has estimated it could take one-fifth of the nation's existing skilled trade workforce.",

    "description": "Warren Buffett became a meme, built a cash mountain, and rocked the business world by announcing his retirement in 2025.",
    "fullText": "Warren Buffett sent shockwaves through the business world in 2025 when he revealed it would be his final year as Berkshire Hathaway CEO — ending a six-decade run in which he transformed the failing textile mill into a vast conglomerate worth over $1 trillion.\n\nThe legendary investor also penned two of his iconic shareholder letters, briefly became a meme, built Berkshire's cash pile to more than $350 billion, took a stake in Alphabet, and rolled out the biggest changes to his company's leadership in decades.\n\nBuffett penned his yearly shareholder letter in February, foreshadowing his departure by talking up two of his planned successors, Greg Abel and Todd Combs.\n\nHe hailed Abel, Berkshire's non-insurance boss and his pick for Berkshire's next CEO, for his honesty and decisiveness. He praised Geico CEO Todd Combs — also one of Buffett's two investment managers, hired to eventually take over Berkshire's portfolio — for swinging the auto insurer from a pre-tax underwriting loss of $1.9 billion in 2022 to a $7.8 billion profit in 2024.\n\n\"Geico was a long-held gem that needed major repolishing,\" Buffett wrote, hailing the improvement under Combs as \"spectacular.\"\n\nBuffett touted Berkshire's tax payments during his tenure, noting the company had gone from paying zero income tax to almost $27 billion in 2024, the most of any US company in history.\n\nHe urged the federal government to \"spend it wisely,\" saying it should go toward helping people who \"get the short straws in life.\"\n\nBuffett went viral during the market correction in March, as followers lauded his prescience in reducing core positions such as Apple and Bank of America and amassing a record cash pile before stocks slumped.\n\nSocial media was filled with people parroting Buffett's advice to \"be greedy when others are fearful,\" and sharing memes about him celebrating or being nonchalant about the sell-off.\n\nTens of thousands of people descended on Buffett's hometown of Omaha in May for Berkshire's shareholder weekend, not knowing they were about to witness history.\n\nAs usual, Buffett held court for hours in an arena filled with his followers. He hailed Geico's turnaround, defended Berkshire's cash hoard, advocated for free trade, warned AI investments could temper returns, and voiced his confidence in Berkshire and America.\n\nIn the closing minutes of the Q&A, Buffett revealed he would step down.\n\n\"I think the time has arrived where Greg should become the chief executive officer of the company at year-end,\" he said.\n\nBuffett said he would continue to \"hang around\" at Berkshire and might be useful on occasion, but the \"final word would be what Greg said — in operations, in capital deployment, whatever it might be.\"\n\nAfter a lengthy standing ovation, Buffett quipped that his shareholders were either applauding his contributions to Berkshire or celebrating his departure.\n\n\"The enthusiasm shown by the audience's response can be interpreted in two ways,\" he said. \"But I'll take it as positive. Thank you.\"\n\nBuffett turned his Thanksgiving message into a love letter to Omaha, in which he reflected on how lucky he's been in life, and thanked the many people who helped him succeed.\n\nThe billionaire gifted Berkshire shares worth about $1.4 billion in total to four of his family's foundations, and said he would accelerate his giving as he wanted his children, now in their 60s and 70s, to distribute virtually his entire fortune.\n\nBuffett hailed Abel as a worthy successor, saying he couldn't think of anyone better to \"handle your savings and mine.\" He also encouraged readers to learn from their mistakes, choose good role models, live up to their desired obituaries, and care for others.\n\n\"When you help someone in any of thousands of ways, you help the world,\" he wrote. \"Kindness is costless but also priceless.\"\n\nBuffett and his team struggled to find bargains once again in 2025 as stocks marched to record highs.\n\nBerkshire sold a net $11 billion of stocks in the first nine months of the year, marking 12 straight quarters as a net seller. It has skipped buybacks for five quarters in a row as well.\n\nThe stock sales and lack of spending helped increase its cash pile, after substracting payables for Treasury purchases, to a record $358 billion as of September 30.\n\nBuffett and his team made several tweaks to Berkshire's stock portfolio. They continued paring Apple and Bank of America, exited Citigroup, and boosted their Occidental Petroleum stake.\n\nThey also unexpectedly built a position in Google-parent Alphabet worth $4.3 billion as of September 30, after placing billion-dollar bets on Constellation Brands and UnitedHealth.\n\nAhead of Buffett's departure as CEO, Berkshire announced sweeping changes to its management team.\n\nThe conglomerate revealed that Combs had resigned to lead a new investment unit at JPMorgan and advise CEO Jamie Dimon.\n\nBerkshire also appointed its first general counsel, announced finance chief Marc Hamburg would retire in June 2027 after 40 years at the company, and disclosed that Abel would be delegating responsibility for more than 30 businesses to NetJets CEO Adam Johnson, in a new role as a divisional president.\n\nBusiness Insider obtained a copy of Combs' farewell letter to Geico employees, which can be read here.",

    "description": "Jim Franck, 81, works as a homebuilder in Oregon and until recently, worked out of financial necessity. He said he has no plans to stop his risky job.",
    "fullText": "This interview is based on a conversation with Jim Franck, 81, a homebuilder in Oregon. Franck said he continues to work to stay active and fulfilled, despite the risks of the job. He has given some of the more intensive responsibilities to his colleagues, though he still is involved with many building tasks. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been building for over 50 years. I started off in the US Virgin Islands. Then, I moved up to Sun River, Oregon, and I went down the coast building houses.\n\nUntil recently, my work has been out of financial necessity. Then, about three or four years ago, home prices doubled, and I was able to sell several rental homes that I'd constructed. Off two homes alone, I made around $700,000 in profit. It was an awful lot of money in one year, and then my income became less important.\n\nI would've kept building anyway, even if I needed the income, but now I don't do it for the money; I'm able to do it as a passion.\n\nI joined the British Merchant Navy when I was in my late teens and got a job as an assistant cook on boats and freighters. We went all around the world, making many stops in the Caribbean. When I left the Merchant Navy, I worked with my brother, who was remodeling enormous houses in London. We worked with investors and turned the homes into apartments.\n\nThen, a friend of mine got a job as a captain on a charter boat out in the Caribbean and needed a cook, so I joined him. One day, we pulled into the US Virgin Islands. I went ashore and made some friends, so I stayed behind on St. Thomas and helped people build houses.\n\nI met my wife there, and we were married and had a son. I got a green card, so I was able to work professionally in the US. As a contractor, I built many concrete houses in St. Thomas, from the foundations to the roof to the finished product, which I then sold.\n\nAround 1980, we came up from the US Virgin Islands to Oregon to see if we liked it. It was a really bad time to have moved; I couldn't find any work. I went back to St. Thomas while my wife stayed in Oregon, and our marriage failed.\n\nI then met my second wife, who was from San Francisco, in St. Thomas. After a hurricane blew through the Virgin Islands and destroyed many houses, we decided to rent out two of the homes I'd built there — which survived the hurricane — because many insurance companies were paying enormous rents for people whose houses had been destroyed. We became interested in Central Oregon, so on one of our ski trips, we bought land in Sun River and moved there.\n\nI started a real estate company and began building down the coast. I still have a copy of the first article a trade magazine wrote about me.\n\nIn 2008, I started thinking about retiring. I had a home that I built down the coast, which we used as our second home, and we spent time there. I kind of retired, but I was always fidgety. I had some custom projects and was doing some design work on future projects.\n\nI took out a loan, bought some land, and started building again in 2015. I put the first house into a rental program, and I was able to secure a mortgage on it, which gave me enough money to buy a lot and build another house. I was building two or three houses a year.\n\nAfter housing prices doubled and I sold my houses, I bought another lot, built a house, and sold it. The last one I sold was $970,000, and I owned it free and clear, so I made a profit.\n\nI now buy beautiful ocean-view lots that are high above the Pacific Ocean. I'm finishing up one house now, which I'm going to keep as a vacation rental, and I just bought another lot, where I'm going to build a three-story house with an elevator. It'll be the first I've ever built with an elevator.\n\nI'm always cognizant of the economy, so I don't want to do anything silly, like build two houses at the same time and then have the problem of being stuck with them.\n\nBoth of my sons can't believe I'm still building houses and working hard. I'm getting to be a bit of a legend around here, too; people come up and ask how old I am and are shocked that I'm still framing houses.\n\nI can't do as much physical labor, and I'm trying to stop doing the heavy lifting. I work with designers, excavators, and a concrete guy, and supervise their work. Then, sheet rockers and painters come in, and we decorate the place. I build homes as if I were going to live in them, since many buyers are older people who are retiring.\n\nI design and build specialties like fireplaces, decks, and screens around hot tubs. I also operate a backhoe, which I really have no problem with. My back hurts a little, and I get sore, but I go home, jump in a bath, and feel grateful I was able to do it.\n\nThe only medication I take is a small blood pressure pill. My respiratory system is excellent, and I can still walk miles a day if I want to. My wife is also in good health, and she spends her days out in the garden.\n\nI don't think I'll ever be able to stop, even though I have plenty of money to live on for the rest of my life, plus a rental house that will bring money in. It's like art to me; an artist keeps painting until they drop dead.",

    "description": "Google's AI told me to make pizza with glue in 2024, so I tried it. Zing! But this year, Google got the last laugh. AI overviews are pretty good.",
    "fullText": "It truly brings me no joy to admit this, but now that it's the end of 2025, I can see that Google's AI Overviews, for as much as I goofed on them for being clumsy and bad, are having the last laugh.\n\nThis realization comes after, in 2024, I totally dunked on Google after its AI told me to use glue to help cheese stick to pizza. So, in a moment of internet infamy, I did just that: I made my glue pizza, and even ate a piece.\n\nThe other day, my editor and I were discussing the state of the AI Overviews. We thought the overviews were pretty abysmal at the start of the year — but we now admit to each other that we use them — instead of traditional search — a lot of the time these days.\n\nOf course, the fact that people (such as myself) are willing to use the AI Overview answer in Google instead of clicking on a link and sending traffic to a website that perhaps employs humans to make that content (such as myself) is not necessarily great.\n\nGoogle AI Overviews launched in the spring of 2024, and immediately, people noticed they often, uh, sucked. The answers they gave were full of absurd inaccuracies.\n\nOne example that went viral on social media was its answer for how to stop the cheese from sliding off your pizza — Google AI suggested adding glue to the sauce, which it seemed to have lifted from a joke on Reddit.\n\nAs a journalist with a commitment to seeking the truth, I actually made a pizza with glue in the sauce and ate it (I'm a trained professional idiot; don't try this at home).\n\nThis year, people noticed that Google AI Overviews still were full of problems. One particularly amusing issue was what we'll call the \"You can't lick a badger twice\" problem: give it a nonsense phrase, and it would accept this as a real idiom and try to explain it.\n\nSomeone on Threads noticed you can type any random sentence into Google, then add “meaning” afterwards, and you’ll get an AI explanation of a famous idiom or phrase you just made up. Here is mine\n\n[image or embed]\n\nTo test more, I made up a few of my own fake idioms like \"you can't fit a duck in a pencil\" and \"the road is full of salsa,\" and indeed, AI Overviews gave explanations for what those phrases meant. Here's what I wrote at the time, back in April:\n\nBut things are getting better. When I tried a fake idiom just the other day (\"you can't tell a yak not to dance\"), it gave a more reasonably accurate answer that it was \"not a common, established idiom, but rather a playful or poetic expression,\" and suggested potential interpretations. Fair enough.\n\nGoogle AI Overviews are getting less laughably bad, and just, well … useful.\n\nI've gotten more used to seeing them, and as I get used to them, I've also gotten better at predicting if the type of query I'm posing is the kind of thing an AI Overview can answer. And it's working more often than it isn't.",

    "description": "Business Insider researched over 20 new dating apps that want to help you find love.",
    "fullText": "Dating app fatigue has gone mainstream, with many people growing tired of swiping, ghosting, being ghosted, and generally treading water while searching for the right fish in the sea.\n\nLuckily, there's a barrage of new apps on the market aiming to help you find the love of your life, a friend with benefits, or both.\n\nSome apps, like Sitch and Ditto, use AI to narrow the dating pool, limiting matches or skipping the app interface entirely in favor of text messages. Other apps match users through mutual connections. For singles who are sick of algorithms altogether, there are startups betting on the in-person meet-cute, hosting dinners, or ticketed events.\n\nThe dating startups aim to disrupt the industry's incumbent power players — Tinder, Hinge, Bumble, and Grindr — which defined a generation of online dating, but have since seen their stock values tumble.\n\nThat means opportunity, and investors are pouring money into the space. Dating startups raised $121 million last year, according to PitchBook data.\n\nStill, it's a tough industry to break into. A dating app needs wide adoption — aka enough potential matches — to be a hit.\n\nSo where can you turn to right now to find love, sex, or new relationships of any kind? We've researched 24 apps that have launched in the US since 2020 and could be new alternatives for your doom-swiping.\n\nFinding the one is all about finding the right one — something which can take a lot of work in the old-school apps. With AI matchmaker chatbots and AI-powered algorithms promising better matches, these apps hope to make that a whole lot easier.\n\nThese apps seek to address one common complaint among app daters — the lack of actual dates. Endless flirtations often fizzle before anyone actually meets for drinks or coffee. With location-based features and rewards for getting off the app and into a bar, a handful of new entrants hope to change that.\n\nNot everyone is interested in dating strangers. A handful of apps are trying to build tools that help people narrow their dating pool to people they have mutual friends (or hobbies) with.\n\nThere's a grab bag of apps looking to refine their user bases by specific affinities or matching principles — and prove they're better dating environments than the main apps. Daters are now matching based on astrology, their Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, or different relationship styles.",

    "description": "Antoine Wade said everyone has the same amount of time in a day to learn about AI tools, and in this moment, everyone is competing.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Antoine Wade, a tech sales employee who is based in San Antonio. His identity and employment have been verified by Business Insider. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI started to use AI around 2022 when ChatGPT first launched. It was unlike any technology that I've come across and I started to leverage it in my personal and professional life.\n\nInitially, it helped me craft emails. I work in tech sales and I have to do a lot of cold outreaches. My job is to write messages that resonate with various leaders and ChatGPT helped me with that.\n\nOnce I started using it at work, I realized that as a sports coach and father, there was so much more I could use it for, like sending post-practice communication to parents, building schedules, or putting together statistics of how the game went. Tasks that used to take me days took me literal minutes.\n\nNow I use AI everyday, and I've experimented with different tools. I use Claude to help with business communication and content generation. I use Perplexity for deep research, and Gemini for image generation. I use these tools for a combination of personal, professional, and educational use-cases. I've learned how to install an air conditioner and how to teach my son 6th grade math.\n\nMy company has also given me access to tools that have been really powerful in sales. It can help with gaining a better understanding of the customer in a minute's notice.\n\nFor example, tools like Salesforce Sales Navigator can pinpoint almost the exact person that may be looking for the product I'm selling. Now when I reach out to that person, the conversation will be more fruitful than it would if it were a completely random cold call.\n\nAI hasn't helped me close deals — I'm the one that's built those relationships with customers — but I've seen an increase in my pipeline because I'm able to reach more clients with the data and messaging.\n\nWhen I'm able to understand the customer better, I'm able to communicate more effectively, which leads to building a better pipeline, which ultimately leads to making more money.\n\nWhile people may have access to the same tools, it's still up to the user to put the data together and craft the right prompts. I've been experimenting with so many automation tools that I've developed a secret sauce.\n\nIf I'm creating prompts that give me a better message, which leads to a better outcome, I may not share it with others because I want to see if it works and if it's going to give me a competitive advantage.\n\nWe all have the same amount of time in a day to learn these things. So if I'm putting more time toward learning more about prompt engineering or how AI is supposed to work, then I don't necessarily want to share those learnings with someone else. In this moment, we're all competing.\n\nI will absolutely help someone if they ask, but there are certain details I'm not as forthcoming about. I may share some of those learnings with some of my closest friends or people I feel I can learn from, but that doesn't mean I'm sharing it with everybody.\n\nSales is very competitive and while companies are choosing to have conversations around AI, some people may not be as comfortable sharing how they're leveraging it because that may be their competitive advantage.\n\nWhen people ask if I use AI, I say \"absolutely, yes.\" But there's only a certain amount of people that I'm going into a deeper conversations about AI with.",

    "description": "PE firms respected Dimon's on-cycle recruiting moratorium in 2025. When the clock strikes midnight on Jan 1, it seems the practice might ramp back up.",
    "fullText": "Private-equity firms have been holding off on Wall Street's most notorious hiring ritual — but they may not wait much longer.\n\nOver the summer, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon reshuffled the deck on the PE recruiting practice known as \"on-cycle,\" when he warned his incoming class of junior bankers against accepting future-dated jobs from buyout firms. This crackdown triggered a temporary moratorium on on-cycle recruiting for the 2027 class. Many of the top PE firms slammed on the brakes— Apollo, General Atlantic, TPG, to name a few — and committed to not recruiting for its 2027 class of employees until at least 2026. Some banks went so far as to say they would fire young employees who accepted lucrative PE jobs for two years down the line.\n\nWith January 1 just days away, there are whispers that the notoriously stressful, rapid-fire on-cycle process will kick off early in 2026, now that PE firms have shown Dimon the necessary grace.\n\n\"On-cycle recruiting hasn't kicked off in 2025, but as soon as the ball drops, all bets are off!\" Anthony Keizner, cofounder of recruiting firm Odyssey Search Partners, told Business Insider over email in early December. \"A lot of investment funds are excited that finally again this year, there's a class of investment banking analysts to interview that have training and deal experience.\"\n\nMatt Ting, the founder of Peak Frameworks, which helps people prepare for Wall Street job interviews, said that most respected Dimon's wishes and held off on recruiting this year.\n\n\"The submissions for our private equity résumé database are due at the beginning of January, which is a bit of an indication of when we think recruiting will kick off,\" Ting said in an email.\n\nThe competitive path to becoming a private equity analyst often begins with an equally competitive investment banking career.\n\nThe frantic marathon known as on-cycle recruiting meant junior bankers typically received a call to drop everything at a moment's notice to take an interview for a job that wouldn't start for another two years.\n\nOnce upon a time — almost a decade ago — a January start would have been normal, according to data from Amity Search Partners. But since the pandemic years, recruiting has shifted progressively earlier, recently starting right as analysts hit the desk in their first investment banking jobs.\n\nIn June 2024, PE firms broke their own record when they began recruiting for 2026 jobs. Some recruits hadn't even begun training for their first full-time investment banking roles.\n\nThis year had the potential to start even earlier — in May, just weeks before Dimon effectively halted the on-cycle whirlwind, fresh college graduates said they were taking introductory coffee chats with PE firms, casting a shadow over what should have been a moment of relief.\n\nThe anxiety doesn't seem to have gone away. Questions about on-cycle are starting to dot the PE message board of Wall Street Oasis, a gossipy if somewhat frenzied online community.\n\nOne person asked for advice on preparing for interviews. Another commenter recently revived a post about the recruiting process that was originally published in April: \"its starting - buckle up.\"",

    "description": "My wife is an extrovert, and I'm an introvert who needs silence. It caused issues in our relationship until I made intentional \"talking time.\"",
    "fullText": "In the early stages of dating my now-wife, our phone calls were epic as we got to know each other. We'd talk as Cindy drove an hour to work and an hour back home. As a business owner, I had plenty of time for these long conversations.\n\nAfter two years of getting to know each other, we met in person for the first time, and there was an instant spark neither of us could explain. We spent a day together in Florida, and as I was leaving to head back to Wisconsin, we kissed. We decided to date after that, but we were still in a long-distance relationship. The distance meant even more marathon talking sessions.\n\nI didn't realize at the time how much of an issue this would become in our eight-year marriage.\n\nWe were getting to know each other. That, and we were in separate parts of the country, so there were in-person conversations in the midst of daily life, which, for me, is more of an energy drain.\n\nAs our relationship grew, we had more visits and in-person conversations. We spent more time together, and I started to notice how all the talking, especially when I had to work, was affecting me.\n\nWe got married, and I moved to Florida. We were finally together full-time in a \"normal\" relationship. It was then that I started to discover something that only proximity could reveal: My wife is a talkaholic (she'll admit this if you ask); she loves to talk and tell long stories. My wife is extroverted and needs human connection, talking, and lots of socialization.\n\nThe proximity and numerous in-person conversations revealed that I'm introverted and thrive when I'm not speaking. I love quiet and require a lot of it.\n\nBeing married and spending all our time together, after years in a long-distance relationship, made me realize that I prefer to speak as little as humanly possible, dislike long conversations and stories, and need a lot of alone time.\n\nBitterness built up with each conversation and event we attended. What started as an annoyance turned into arguments.\n\nYears of therapy have taught me that I can't let bitterness build up too long and that communication is important. I realized we were not on a good path in our relationship, and something drastic needed to change.\n\nWe had a series of brutally honest conversations that involved more than a few tears. My wife and I discussed what we need from our relationship in terms of attention, communication, and socialization.\n\nWe agreed on a simple rule that works for us as an introvert and an extrovert in a relationship.\n\nWhat this looks like is me going to a hotel for a weekend or visiting my adult kids who still live in Wisconsin, while my wife visits her friends in South Florida.\n\nI also agreed to set aside focused and dedicated time (when I have the bandwidth) to let my wife verbally process everything she needs to get out of her head. I give her \"talking time\" in an intentional way.\n\nThe understanding we came to means I regularly get the alone time I need. The alone time also allows us to miss each other and operate in ways that work best for our personalities.\n\nMy getting the alone time I need has strengthened our marriage.\n\nWe've had the opportunity to test the rule even more after we moved from the US to Thailand permanently.\n\nWe are now in a situation where there's no family close by, the friends we hung out with in the US aren't here, and we're not getting frequent visits from our adult kids. We are all we have in a foreign country, which is harder for my wife.\n\nIn our first few months here, I wanted to give my wife what she needed: extra attention and time together, talking it up about anything and everything.\n\nAs we've started to settle in, I've been coworking at Starbucks throughout Bangkok, taking long walks alone, and having plenty of solo foot massages. I also built out a detached office, where I spend a lot of time alone.\n\nMy wife has also made friends and attended local women's networking events; she's getting the socialization and talking time she needs. She's building her community, and they seem to enjoy talking in the same way she does.\n\nWe're both getting what we need to keep our mental health and relationship healthy.\n\nMost importantly, I've learned that it's OK to prioritize what I need, and that I don't always have to put the needs of my loved ones before my own. I can put myself first without everything falling apart.",

There was some discussion as to whether to include the outage on the Y2K dashboard or not.\"\n\nNow let's meet another reader we'll call \"Kerry\" who worked for a University that ordered all computers machines be turned off for Y2K eve.\n\nKerry's job saw him manage a fleet of Unix servers, and he decided to ignore that instruction.\n\n\"I was confident that nothing serious would go wrong and that my users could continue to work from home,\" he told On Call.\n\nKerry therefore went home and prepared for the millennium eve party he intended to host.\n\n\"At around 4pm everything electrical stopped working,\" he told The Register. \"I felt the bottom drop out from under me. Were the doomsday predictions true?\"\n\n\"I quickly found out the out that my neighbors did not have the same problem,\" Graham told On Call. \"The main fuse of my house had blown because we were using way too much power.\"\n\nAnd when he returned to work the following week, all was well – other than the banner page on print jobs dated \"Monday January 3 1900.\"\n\nNow let's meet a reader we'll Regomize as \"Rob\" who at the time of Y2K worked for Sun Microsystems in the UK.\n\nAs a global company, Sun had an early warning system for any Y2K problems: Its Australian office was 11 hours ahead of the UK office, so if any problems struck there, the company would get advance notice.\n\nWhich is why, as midnight neared Down Under, Rob's boss called Sun's Sydney office … then heard the phone line go terrifyingly silent as the clock ticked pas midnight. Rob said that \"scared the hell out of my manager\" – at least for a few moments, because the phone soon rang.\n\n\"It was the Australian office, laughing their heads off,\" Rob told On Call. ®",

But I also found texts generated by LLMs. These models are effective at creating plausible-sounding content, but (for now) they often fail to generate correct checksums for identifiers like ISBNs.

I'll show how the tool works and how it identifies this anti-knowledge. But the tech is only half the story. The other half is human. I contacted the editors who had added this undeclared AI content.

    "fullText": "From Stanley Tucci’s imperious tech titan to Lex Luthor’s distractingly hot CEO and Elon Musk-esque blowhards, films this year took us inside the billionaire mindset\n\nBetween the slash-and-burn US government reboot led by a dank meme fan and the relentless pushing of AI by venture capital-backed blowhards, 2025 has felt like peak obnoxious tech bro. Fittingly, jargon-spouting, self-regarding digital visionaries also became Hollywood’s go-to baddies this year in everything from blockbusters to slapstick spoofs. Spare a thought for the overworked props departments tasked with mocking up fake Forbes magazine covers heralding yet another smirking white guy as “Master of the Metaverse” or whatever.\n\nWith such market saturation, the risk is that all these delusional dudes blend into one smarmy morass. It felt reasonable to expect that Stanley Tucci might sprinkle a little prosciutto on The Electric State, Netflix’s no-expense-spared alt-history robot fantasia. As Ethan Skate – creator of the “neurocaster” technology that quashed an AI uprising then turned the general populace into listless virtual-reality addicts – Tucci certainly looked the part: bald and imperious in retro Bond villain wardrobe. But even the great cocktail-maker couldn’t squeeze much out of sour existential proclamations such as: “Our world is a tyre fire floating on an ocean of piss.”\n\nThere was more baldness in Superman, where Nicholas Hoult’s Lex Luthor embodied the worst kind of wannabe paradigm-changer: one desperate to appear on talkshows. Incensed that the world seemed to be ignoring his genius in favour of a flying alien do-gooder, the LuthorCorp founder spent a fortune to rig social media, deploying an army of vivisected monkey cyborgs to swamp platforms with anti-Superman hashtags and memes. That the film itself was met with farmed outrage about perceived wokeness added a disconcerting hall-of-mirrors feel to what was essentially an overstuffed crowdpleaser. Hoult’s Lex was also a distractingly hot tech CEO, which pushed the film further into the realm of fantasy.\n\nIs it more appealing when these self-regarding douchebags are funny? In the heightened world of killer doll action thriller M3gan 2.0, Jemaine Clement was sleazily overconfident as Alton Appleton, a high-functioning billionaire whose latest wheeze was pushing an unwanted neural implant on the masses. Seduced by an impassive fembot assassin, Alton was humiliated in his final moments, his signature Altwave tech effortlessly hacked, his weird prosthetic six-pack coming unstuck. It was pathetic but humanising. As the movie trundled on, you actually began to miss him.\n\nIf Clement nailed tech bro obliviousness, Danny Huston had to remain deadpan opposite Liam Neeson’s blathering Frank Drebin Jr in The Naked Gun reboot. Huston’s Richard Cane was a hybrid Jeff Bezos/Elon Musk-esque blowhard who used the galactic profits from his online retail and electric car empires to make a Primordial Law of Toughness device . His master plan was to zap the general public back to a prehistoric mindset, violently culling the herd and ushering in a new age for humankind (or at least his zillionaire class). Cane was obsessed with men’s sperm counts, building luxury bunkers for the super-rich and Black Eyed Peas. In other words: truly psychotic.\n\nIn the goopy, grungy world of The Toxic Avenger reboot, Kevin Bacon’s floppy-haired biotech baddie Bob Garbinger stood out simply because he looked so pale and pampered. While it’s not a great sign when a self-proclaimed “healthstyle” guru gets Sisyphus and syphilis mixed up, Garbinger’s habit of going shirtless while flogging “proprietary cutting-edge bio-boosters” in TV ads felt like a timely skewering of immortality-seeking biohackers such as Bryan Johnson.\n\nIn 2022, Evan Peters played the lead in Netflix’s ghoulish Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story. Did that influence his casting as a second-generation nepo baby in Tron: Ares? To be fair, his Julian Dillinger – grandson of David Warner’s boardroom bully from the original 1982 Tron – seemed more neurotic than psychotic: a baby-faced tech huckster with crappy circuit board sleeve tattoos whose audacious move into 3D-printing wicked neon war machines and digital commandos was only slightly scuppered by the fact that they imploded within 30 minutes. A wildly expensive, resource-intensive, essentially useless product? Intentionally or not, it felt like an appropriate metaphor for the AI bubble.\n\nBut why stop at just one douchey tech bro? Jesse Armstrong’s jagged satire Mountainhead took the bold step of making every single character the absolute worst of the “move fast, break stuff” billionaire mindset, isolating them – and the viewer – in a remote, repellently deluxe ski lodge while the spectre of possible Armageddon encroached. As the Musk-alike owner of a social media app spreading dangerous AI-augmented misinformation, Cory Michael Smith captured the glib, morality-agnostic tone of someone richer than God who views the world as their plaything.\n\nAs Venis (Smith), silverback investor Randall (Steve Carell), canny algorithm tamer Jeff (Ramy Youssef) and would-be wellness app supremo Souper (Jason Schwartzman) relentlessly needled each other, there was the illicit thrill of dialling into the combative quartet’s inside-baseball repartee of boasting, toasting and roasting. But as the globe lurched further into chaos, watching these four nominal thought leaders clumsily workshop how best to exploit the situation was depressing, not least because it seemed so plausible. We have all been forced to absorb the pathologies of our tech overlords due to their disproportionate influence in the real world. As a new cinema year looms, is it too much to ask that we don’t have to keep doing it at the movies too?",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: CST highlights volume of IS-supporting accounts and says social media firms ‘putting all of us in danger’\n\nFacebook hosted terrorist propaganda that celebrated the murder of Jews and praised Islamic State, a leading anti-hate group has alleged.\n\nThe posts included celebrations of the Bondi beach massacre that the Community Security Trust says Facebook has been too slow to take down. The posts were still on Facebook on 16 December, two days after the attack, and received shares and likes.\n\nSome accounts are Britain-based and those have been reported to counter-terrorism police in the UK as a matter of urgency.\n\nOne post shows video of the aftermath of the Bondi beach attack, which was allegedly carried out by a father and son who were IS supporters, and says: “Allah is the greatest and praise to Allah.” It has clearly been viewed, with more than 100 likes, 27 comments and four shares recorded.\n\nFifteen people were killed as they celebrated the Jewish festival of Hanukah in Sydney on 14 December. One of the attackers also died.\n\nAnother post shows a photo of one of the Bondi beach gunmen and says: “The coming years of art and hell,” and contains praise for an IS leader. This had 12 shares and more than 300 likes.\n\nFacebook said it was in the process of removing some of the posts after being contacted by the Guardian, and said some had already been spotted and removed.\n\nDave Rich, the director of policy for the CST, which works to keep Jewish people safe from attack, said: “The sheer volume of IS-supporting accounts promoting terrorist content on Facebook is deeply alarming, and the posts celebrating the Bondi terrorist attack are utterly nauseating.\n\n“Yet again, social media companies are incapable of meeting even their most basic of responsibilities and are putting all of us in danger as a result. This simply should not be happening any more. We will be calling on Ofcom to urgently investigate Meta’s failings and to take strong action where possible.”\n\nOfcom, the media regulator, said: “If a post is reported to a platform now, the platform must decide whether the content is illegal under UK law, and take it down swiftly if it is. Our job is to make sure sites and apps have appropriate measures in place to comply with their duties.”\n\nIt said it had received “evidence that suggests terrorist content and illegal hate speech is persisting on some of the largest social media sites”.\n\nA spokesperson for Meta, which owns Facebook, declined to answer a series of questions but said: “The content was removed for violating our policies around dangerous organisations and individuals.”\n\nA Home Office spokesperson said: “Social media content promoting terrorism or violence against communities is absolutely unacceptable, and will not be tolerated. The law is clear: social media platforms must take action to prevent illegal content on their sites, including terrorist and violent material.”\n\nThe focus on pro-IS material on popular social media sites comes amid concern about an increase in terrorist efforts to target Jewish people across the west.\n\nTwo men were convicted on 22 December of a plot to get machine guns and shoot Jewish people around the north-west of England. In that plot and the Sydney massacre, both sets of terrorists’ approaches had a degree of sophistication.\n\nThough neither was “directed” by IS, the Sydney attackers visited the Philippines and the north-west England machine-gun plotters had contact with an IS person overseas and were sophisticated enough to try to bypass Jewish community security and infiltrate a Facebook group, giving them details of potential Jewish targets.\n\nRich said of the English plot: “This is an even more serious plot than the attack on the synagogue in Heaton Park and indicates a much greater level of training and sophistication.”\n\nVicki Evans, the senior national coordinator for counter-terrorism policing, told the Guardian: “The terrorist threats we face do not stand still and we rarely confine them to history. Instead, they flex in intensity and risk over time – and so does our response.\n\n“Recent attacks in Manchester and Australia are clear reminders of the range of threats we face, and we continue to ask the public to … report any concerns they see in their real-world or online communities.”",

    "fullText": "Last few months of the year have seen $1tn in value wiped from the market, despite all-time-high price of bitcoin\n\nAs 2025 comes to a close, Donald Trump’s favorable approach to cryptocurrency has not proven to be enough to sustain the industry’s gains, once the source of market-wide optimism and enthusiasm. The last few months of the year have seen $1tn in value wiped from the digital asset market, despite bitcoin hitting an all-time-high price of $126,000 on 6 October.\n\nThe October price peak was short-lived. Bitcoin’s price tumbled just days later after Trump’s announcement of 100% tariffs on China sent shockwaves across the market on 12 October. The crypto market saw $19bn liquidated in 24 hours – the largest liquidation event on record. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, saw a 40% drop in price over the next month. Eric Trump’s own crypto company endured a similar drop in its value in December.\n\nIn Donald Trump, the crypto industry was delivered the pro-bitcoin president they were promised during his campaign. Within days of taking office for the second time, he issued an executive order that repealed restrictions on cryptocurrency and introduced new favorable regulations as well as a presidential working group on digital assets.\n\n“The digital asset industry plays a crucial role in innovation and economic development in the United States, as well as our Nation’s international leadership,” the order read. He placed cryptocurrency front and center in American policy.\n\nAgain in March, Trump announced a new strategic cryptocurrency reserve that fueled a 62% rally in the market prices of three out of five of the coins named to the reserve. Bitcoin, the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency, went up 10% to $94,164 in the hours after the reserve was announced.\n\nCryptocurrency is sensitive to both narratives and confidence in global markets, said Rachael Lucas, the head of marketing and communications at BTC Markets, Australia’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. It’s what is called a risk-on asset, an investment that does better when investors are feeling confident about the economy and are willing to take on more risk, Lucas said.\n\n“The Trump administration may be pro-crypto, but tariffs and tight monetary policy outweigh positive vibes,” said Lucas. “And it’s also just a reminder, especially for people in crypto, that macro forces really matter more than political stances.”\n\nIn November, bitcoin suffered its biggest drop in price since 2021, bringing the coin’s value to less than $81,000. While bitcoin regained some of that value in the weeks after, the digital token started December with another slump, dropping 6% after Strategy, the biggest holder of bitcoin, cut its earnings forecast because of the slide in crypto prices. Bitcoin’s price now hovers near $90,000, up from years past but significantly lower than its peak.\n\nIn the first few days of December 2025, Eric Trump’s crypto firm, American Bitcoin Corp, saw 40% of its value – roughly $1bn – wiped out.\n\nThe Trump family scion put on a bullish face and declared he would ride out the decline. “I’m holding all my @ABTC shares - I’m 100% committed to leading the industry,” Eric Trump said on X at the time.\n\nSome experts fear the industry is entering a so-called crypto winter, a prolonged period of stagnation or losses. The last time, crypto winter lasted from the end of 2021 through 2023, when the FTX mogul Sam Bankman-Fried was tried and convicted. Those years saw bitcoin slump 70% in price.\n\nDespite the optimism fueled by Trump’s win, the current market downturn shows the crypto-friendly administration wasn’t enough to usher in a return to the “retail mania” of 2021, when there was a huge upswing in individual stock trading, said Christian Catalini, the founder of the MIT Cryptoeconomics Lab.\n\n“The recent crash isn’t a change in sentiment, but a collision of three structural factors: the aftershocks of a $19bn leverage washout in October; a risk-off rotation driven by US-China tariff tensions; and, crucially, the potential unraveling of the corporate treasury trade,” Catalini said.\n\nAnother potential factor that may have shaken the crypto market is the downturn in share prices of AI stocks like Nvidia, said Lucas.\n\n“One of the reasons why bitcoin is tied to the AI cycle is because a lot of the bitcoin miners actually started leveraging their energy towards new datacenters,” she said. “Not only is crypto a technical asset, we have the miners actually tied into AI devices going up. That negative sentiment tends to sneak into crypto.”\n\nDespite concerns over a crypto winter, notable players in the crypto space Larry Fink, the CEO of investment management firm BlackRock, and Brian Armstrong, the co-founder of Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the US, expressed optimism about the long-term value of the currency at a recent New York Times conference. Armstrong said “there was no chance” the price of bitcoin would go to zero and in fact 2025 would be seen as the year “when crypto went from gray market to a well-lit establishment”. Fink, for his part, said his firm had observed “legitimate long owners investing in the currency”, including sovereign wealth funds.\n\nLucas said that this downturn in crypto prices was not inconsistent with past four-year bitcoin cycles and that she was not worried about entering a much more sustained crypto winter.\n\n“If I was looking at it from a traditional bitcoin cycle, we are actually technically in a bear market,” said Lucas. “But as you can see, even with all of these macros that are affecting the market, bitcoin has still managed to set a price above $80,000.”",

    "description": "BBC Sport reflects on a stellar year for South Africa which threatens to be overshadowed by a lack of home Test cricket.",
    "fullText": "From a certain vantage point, the health of Test cricket in South Africa appears terminal.\n\nFor the first time since sporting isolation during apartheid, there will be no red-ball action in the country this summer. Instead, fans must make do watching Indian-owned T20 franchises compete in the SA20.\n\nThe next time the Proteas take the field in whites on home soil will be October 2026, 21 months after hosting Pakistan in January this year.\n\nAnd yet the Test team itself has rarely looked in better shape, with 2025 proving a watershed year.\n\nRyan Rickelton registered his country's first double century for nine years as Pakistan were swept 2–0. In June, a sublime fourth-innings 136 from Aiden Markram, allied to a nine-wicket match haul from Kagiso Rabada, carried South Africa to a five-wicket victory over Australia in the World Test Championship (WTC) final at Lord's.\n\nAnd with the choker's tag finally dislodged, and momentum behind them, South Africa are on track to qualify for another WTC final.\n\nWiaan Mulder threatened Brian Lara's record for the highest Test score when he declared himself on 367 against Zimbabwe in July. In October, Keshav Maharaj bagged a seven-for in Rawalpindi to square the series with Pakistan.\n\nA month later, Simon Harmer claimed 17 wickets in two Tests as South Africa beat India 2-0 in their own backyard, becoming the first South African team to win away in India since 2000.\n\n\"It's been a remarkable period for us,\" says Sunuran Muthusamy, the spin-bowling all-rounder who scored his maiden century in the 408-run win in the second Test against India.\n\n\"We're straight into the SA20 so it's hard to really take stock. But in the small moments when we've had a chance to reflect, we know that we've found a great formula. It feels like things are really clicking.\"",

    "fullText": "In 2024, I took the leap to go indie full-time. By 2025, that shift enabled me to focus exclusively on building tools I care about, from a blogging platform, iOS apps, and macOS utilities, to Emacs packages. It also gave me the space to write regularly, covering topics like Emacs tips, development tutorials for macOS and iOS, a few cooking detours, and even launching a new YouTube channel.\n\nThe rest of this post walks through some of the highlights from 2025. If you’ve found my work useful, consider sponsoring. Now let’s jump in.\n\nFor well over a decade, my blogging setup consisted of a handful of Elisp functions cobbled together over the years. While they did the job just fine, I couldn't shake the feeling that I could do better, and maybe even offer a blogging platform without the yucky bits of the modern web. At the beginning of the year, I launched LMNO.lol. Today, my xenodium.com blog proudly runs on LMNO.lol.\n\nLMNO.lol blogs render pretty much anywhere (Emacs and terminals included, of course).\n\n2026 is a great year to start a blog! Custom domains totally welcome.\n\nSure, there are plenty of journaling and note-taking apps out there. For one reason or another, none of them stuck for me (including my own apps). That is, until I learned a thing or two from social media.\n\nWith that in mind, Journelly was born: like tweeting, but for your eyes only. With the right user experience, I felt compelled to write things down all the time. Saving to Markdown and Org markup was the mighty sweet cherry on the cake.\n\nAs a Japanese language learning noob, what better way to procrastinate than by building yet another Kana-practicing iOS app? Turns out, it kinda did the job.\n\nHere's mochi invaders, a fun way to practice your Kana\n\n2025 brought us the likes of Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Goose, Codex, and many more AI/LLM CLI agents. While CLI utilities have their appeal, I wanted a native Emacs integration, so I simply ignored agents for quite some time.\n\nI was initially tempted to write my own Emacs agent, but ultimately decided against it. My hope was that agent providers would somehow converge to offer editor integration, so I could focus on building an Emacs integration while leveraging the solid work from many teams producing agents. With LLM APIs historically fragmented, my hope for agent convergence seemed fairly far-fetched.\n\nTo my surprise, ACP (Agent Client Protocol) was announced by Zed and Google folks. This was the cue I had been waiting for, so I set out to build acp.el, a UX agnostic elisp library, followed by an actual client: agent-shell.\n\nI'm fairly happy with how agent-shell's been shaping up. This is my most popular package from 2025, receiving lots of user feedback. If you're curious about the feature-set, I've written about agent-shell's progress from early on:\n\nWhile agent-shell is the new kid on the block, chatgpt-shell received DeepSeek, Open Router, Kagi, and Perplexity support, in addition to a handful of other improvements and bugfixes.\n\nWhile most of what I share usually ends up as a blog post, this year I decided to try something new. I started the Bending Emacs YouTube channel and posted 8 episodes:\n\nEnjoying the content? Leave me a comment or \n\nWhile I enthusiastically joined the Emacs Carnival, I didn't quite manage monthly posts. Having said that, when I did participate, I went all in, documenting my org experience over the last decade. Ok well… I also joined in with my elevator pitch ;)\n\nWhile migrating workflows to Emacs makes them extra portable across platforms, I've also accumulated a bunch of tweaks enhancing your Emacs experience on macOS.\n\nWhile we're talking macOS, I typically like my desktop free from distractions, which includes hiding the status bar.\n\nHaving said that, I don't want to lose track of time, and for that, I built EverTime, an ever-present floating clock (available via Homebrew).\n\nEmacs ships with a perfectly functional world clock, available via M-x world-clock, but I wanted a little more, so I built time-zones.\n\nFor better or worse, I rely on WhatsApp Messenger. Migrating to a different client or protocol just isn't viable for me, so I did the next best thing and built wasabi, an Emacs client ;)\n\nWhile not a trivial task, wuzapi and whatsmeow offered a huge leg up. I wanted tighter Emacs integration, so I upstreamed a handful of patches to add JSON-RPC support, plus easier macOS installation via Homebrew.\n\nWhile both macOS and iOS offer APIs for generating URL previews, they also let you fetch rich page metadata. I built rinku, a tiny command-line utility, and showed how to wire it all up via eshell for a nifty shell experience.\n\nWith similar eshell magic, you can also get a neat cat experience.\n\nI always liked the idea of generating some sort of art or graphics from a code base, so I built one, a utility to transform images into character art using text from your codebase. Also covered in a short blog post.\n\nEmacs is just about the perfect porcelain for command-line utilities. With little ceremony, you can integrate almost any CLI tool. Magit remains the gold standard for CLI integration.\n\nWhile trimming videos doesn't typically spring to mind as an Emacs use case, I was pleasantly surprised by the possibilities.\n\nWhile I've built my fair share of Emacs packages, I'm still fairly new at submitting Emacs features upstream. This year, I landed my send-to (aka sharing on macOS) patch. While the proposal did spark quite the discussion, I'm glad I stuck with it. Both Eli and Stefan were amazingly helpful.\n\nThis year, I also wanted to experiment with dictating into my Emacs text buffers, but unfortunately dictation had regressed in Emacs 30.\n\nBummer. But hey, it gave me a new opportunity to submit another patch upstream.\n\nReady Player, my Emacs media-playing package received further improvements like starring media (via Emacs bookmarks), enabling further customizations, and other bug fixes. Also showcased a tour of its features.\n\nHope you enjoyed my 2025 contributions. Sponsor the work.",

We always have done,\" says Webborn.\n\n\"And it's those little things, how we convert those silvers into gold, that just push you up that medal table a little bit higher.\n\n\"The Paralympic team have been brilliant, they've been second in the medal table behind China for the last several Games, but other nations are pushing them. But I believe the character and the innovation that we have in the UK will continue to keep us there.\n\n\"The collaboration between Olympic and Paralympic sports has never been better. You can definitely see that in the discussions that they're having. We're learning from each other.\"\n\nUK Sport has not yet revealed a medal target for the upcoming Winter Games in Milan and Cortina in Italy, but Webborn is optimistic.\n\n\"The current group of athletes are having some amazing success in this early season, it's great to see. That doesn't always transfer into medals at the Games, but we're in a really good place,\" he says.",

    "description": "Creating onboarding documentation for your product? Or just writing up a \"how-to\" for a new internal tool? Here's how you do it.",
    "fullText": "You have 1 article left to read this month before you need to register a free LeadDev.com account.\n\nReceive weekly engineering insights to level up your leadership approach.\n\nEstimated reading time: 5 minutes\n\nDocumentation can be a pain for developers to write and navigate alike. But following this framework might be just the thing you need to make document navigation easier.\n\nDocumentation is the lifeblood of any high-functioning team. At a high level, documents are written to outline the feature processes, details, and general “how-to” elements of a system. The result? A bank of saved knowledge that helps new developers get up to speed quickly, providing a common reference point for all necessary stakeholders.\n\nA common pain point for many teams is unstructured documentation. Without clear guidelines, it’s hard to organize information in a way that’s easy to digest or search through. My team faced this problem when creating onboarding documentation for our new AI product; this would ultimately be used by engineers at client companies integrating the product into their systems.\n\nWe adopted the Diátaxis method as our guiding framework for technical documentation. The Diataxis approach identifies four distinct user needs in documentation: tutorials, how-to guides, explanations, and references.\n\nUltimately, this led to our documentation process improving and our user experience boosting.\n\nWhile the advantages of documentation are manifold, developers (including myself) tend to skip dipping into them if they appear to be unstructured or have an undefined goal.\n\nEach page should have a clear purpose. This sets expectations and helps engineers identify which pages answer their questions. Organizing pages with anticipated questions at the forefront of the design can help you build documentation that engineers navigate more intuitively.\n\nPut yourself in a developer’s shoes. If they’re using a product for the first time, what questions would they likely ask?\n\nStructure your content with user needs first. When your docs are built around real questions, they become easier to flick through and far more useful.\n\nAvoid packing too many ideas into one section. In doing so, you might create a long-winded document that jumps between topics and leaves explanations of singular issues scattered across multiple pages.\n\nThe Diátaxis framework outlines how documentation is composed of three key elements:\n\nSome developers have the skill for content and style, but could bolster their architecture abilities.\n\nWhat’s unique about Diátaxis is that it addresses the challenges of technical writing and breaks them down into four key sections: tutorials, how-to guides, explanations, and references.\n\nThe two quadrants, tutorials and how-to guides belong in the action region. Tutorials and how-to guides are not meant to be consumed passively by readers; rather, they actively help devs learn a new skill or achieve a specific goal.\n\nThe two bottom quadrants, explanations and references, belong in the cognition region. These are resources that readers can read or skim to understand and grasp the essence of a solution.\n\nTutorials and explanations are about skill acquisition. They’re designed to teach – not to solve an immediate task, but to build understanding. The goal is to help readers pick up a new skill relevant to the new tool or product they’re working with.\n\nHow-to guides and references are about skill application. They’re for readers who have already learned the basics and are now ready to put that knowledge into action.\n\nWhen we started to build documentation for our product, we geared the content toward two different technical stakeholders: data scientists and AI engineers. After all, our goal was to have data scientists lean on our AI product when running simulation experiments, subsequently empowering engineers to deploy these experiments to production.\n\nBefore embarking on writing the documents, we defined two main personas and described some key qualities about them to better identify what documentation we needed to create. Let’s call them Alice and Bob.\n\nOnce we defined our two main personas, we designed the following navigation bar for our docsite:\n\nWe have six main “folders” with a defined purpose for each, highlighting the experience level required. The first three folders are meant for beginners or users being onboarded. The next three folders are for already-onboarded users, who have specific goals they want to achieve or details they want to look up.\n\nNote that some of these folders may not be necessary for your solution. For example, if you’re not introducing new abstractions or concepts that readers need to know about, the “concepts folder” may not be required for your docsite.\n\nAfterwards, we assigned our developers to write different parts of the documentation following this architecture for the two main personas, Alice and Bob. Here are some examples where we map a question to a folder.\n\nAs Alice and Bob become better acquainted with the resources, so too does their mental model of the documentation’s architecture. This helps in instances where they may need to help newer colleagues navigate the system. For instance, if Alice is working with the APIs and wants to onboard a new data scientist, she can pull from previous experience and quickly direct the data scientist to the right folder.\n\nStrong developer documentation can be a major selling point for a product. Developers do not trust using a new product in their tech stack unless they can understand its underlying details and have clear product documentation to search through.\n\nSo it’s your job to create a comprehensive database of knowledge that can support devs while they get to grips with your product.",

    "description": "This article examines why the practice of AI startups disguising GMV as ARR distorts business sustainability. It redefines the true meaning of ARR and analyzes how the revenue structure of many AI companies resembles a brokerage or reseller model rather than SaaS. Using the analogy of investors who only inflate transaction volume, it presents—from a consulting perspective—why repeatability, margins, and control are far more critical than the magnitude of the numbers.",
    "fullText": "In recent feeds and headlines covering AI startups, a certain phrase repeats with exhausting frequency:\n\"Reached $X million ARR in just n months.\"\n\nAt first, it is impressive.\nThe second time, it invites skepticism.\n\nThis is not merely a matter of accounting tricks or semantic hair-splitting.\nIt is a fundamental question about the structure of AI businesses, their sustainability, and how we ought to interpret the numbers presented to us.\n\nARR stands for Annual Recurring Revenue.\nThe two operative words here carry weight.\n\nThese are run-rates.\nARR is not a prediction; it is a result verified by time.\n\nFundamentally,\nFor a company less than a year old to claim ARR is, conceptually, a contradiction.\n\nThe year has not passed.\nThe recurrence has not been proven.\n\nARR is the lingua franca of SaaS.\nAnd the language of SaaS invariably connotes:\n\nThus, many AI companies,\neven those far from reaching that stage,\nborrow the term ARR to describe their finances.\n\nThe problem begins exactly there.\n\nPeer slightly beneath the surface of many AI startup revenue structures, and a pattern emerges.\n\nIn this structure, the portion the company actually retains is but a fraction of the total payment.\n\nHere, the correct concept is GMV (Gross Merchandise Value).\n\nGMV represents the total value of merchandise sold through a platform.\nThe critical distinction is this:\n\nIf a platform mediates a transaction and takes a commission,\nGMV ≠ Revenue.\n\nThe illusion specific to the AI industry arises here.\n\nOn the surface, it mimics SaaS perfectly.\n\nIn this structure, calling GMV \"ARR\" is,\nAn act of consuming an unproven future as a present achievement.\n\nTo put it more bluntly,\nit borders on a bluff designed to induce a financing illusion.\n\n\"Model costs are dropping, so even if margins are thin now, they will improve.\"\n\nThis statement is only half true.\n\nTechnology costs do decrease.\nHowever, demand always migrates to the newest, most powerful models.\n\nOf course, low-cost models have their place—simple tasks, non-competitive domains.\n\nBut the question remains:\nIs the product you are building truly that kind of product?\n\nWe are cognitively greedy.\nGiven the same time and money, we desire the smarter brain.\n\nUltimately, the discussion boils down to one thing.\n\nNeither is inherently right or wrong.\nBut how they are valued must be completely different.\n\nA large GMV does not equate to a solid foundation.\n\nThe spectacle of GMV-first growth often reminds me of a familiar scene.\n\nThe investor with $10,000 of capital,\nwho trades dozens of times a day,\nboasting, \"I moved millions in transaction volume this month.\"\n\nThe trades are many.\nThe numbers are large.\nBut what actually remains?\n\nMostly transaction fees paid to the exchange.\nThe volume swells, but the asset base barely moves.\n\nAI startups obsessed with GMV are not so different.\n\nBut the vast majority of that flow\npasses through to model providers and infrastructure giants,\nleaking straight out of the building.\n\nTo discuss GMV as if it were ARR in this context is\nnot a demonstration of capital control,\nbut rather an attempt to prove competence via the sheer volume of money that passed through one's hands.\n\nFrom a consulting perspective, the questions are simple.\n\nARR is not a marketing slogan.\nIt is a report card proving that a financial structure has withstood the test of time.\n\nGMV can be a signal of growth.\nBut it is, at best, a process metric.\nIt cannot substitute for the foundation.\n\nIn the AI era, numbers have become larger and faster.\nThat is precisely why we must be more honest with our terminology.\n\nThe moment you slap the label of ARR onto GMV,\nthe business begins to look solid,\nbut in reality, it is being built on sand.\n\nTime will eventually reveal the truth.\nWhether you were a company that made many trades,\nor a company that accumulated value.\n\nTime always distinguishes the two.",

    "description": "I wanted a way to have physical tickets from GitHub in front of me. One Epson printer, a Raspberry Pi, and some PHP later, I had a working system in place.",
    "fullText": "I have a lot of side projects on GitHub. Some of them are kind of popular, and I tend to get issues posted from time to time. The problem though is that usually they kind of get lost in the mix of my emails, or I forget to go through my repos and add new items to my todo list.\n\nI've been occasionally writing new issues down on sticky notes whenever I see a notification for an issue, but I always wanted an excuse to streamline the process a bit more. After seeing a receipt printer spitting out orders while grabbing some take-out the other day, I wondered if I could use one to print out a ticket each time an issue was added to one of my repos.\n\nSo here's why I bought a receipt printer:\n\nEvery time one of my GitHub repos gets a new issue, I now get a physical ticket printed out on my desk 🪄 pic.twitter.com/g6uYtGP9J7\n\nSo let's dive in and I'll show you exactly what I used, and how I set it up!\n\nIn order to get started, I'll need a thermal receipt printer and some way to get data into it. I ended up using:\n\nThe reason that I went with an Epson thermal printer is that they use the ESC/POS command set, for which there's established libraries in a variety of programming languages. Plus they're pretty ubiquitous in the second-hand market, and I was able to pick one up on Ebay along with some receipt paper for a pretty fair price.\n\nThe other piece I need is some kind of hardware to connect from the internet to the printer, and facilitate the actual data sending. I could just hook it up to my PC, but I want this to be a fully-contained unit that could just be constantly on idle sitting in a corner. I have an old Raspberry Pi Zero W laying around that I'm not using, so I'll choose that.\n\nBecause the RPi Zero has just a single micro USB port, I'll use an adapter as well as a USB Type-B cable to connect it to the receipt printer.\n\nAlright, so we have the printer hooked up, the Raspberry Pi good to go, but now I need a way to send data to the printer from the Raspberry Pi. This could easily be accomplished with Node or Python, but since I'm a PHP developer and I enjoy stretching the limitations of the language, I'll reach for that. Luckily for me, there's a pretty solid library for working with ESC/POS commands available in PHP.\n\nBefore I write any code though, I have to make sure the printer is available to the program I create. Since I'm using Ubuntu on the Raspberry Pi, I should be able to access it via /dev/usb/lp0 (or another lp#). But it might require a little bit of prep work first.\n\nFirst, I'll open up a terminal in the device that my printer is connected to (for me, that's the Raspberry Pi). I'll run the command lsusb to get the Product ID and Vendor ID from the connection to your printer. It returns something like this:\n\nNext, I create a udev rule to let users belonging to the dialout group use the printer. I create the file /etc/udev/rules.d/99-escpos.rules and add the following to it:\n\nBeing sure to replace the hex values for the vendor and product ID's with what I got returned back from lsusb.\n\nIf my user(s) aren't part of the dialout group, I try to add them to it now:\n\nAnd then finally, I have to restart udev:\n\nNow that I have the connection ready, I can start writing some code to test this out. First, I'll require that library from earlier with Composer:\n\nAfter that's installed, I need to write some code to send data to the printer. I'll create a file called index.php, and add the following:\n\nSo now to run this, all I have to do is execute the script with PHP and root permissions:\n\nIf everything worked out fine, Hello, world! will have printed on a receipt, with two lines skipped, and then the receipt will have cut. How that all works is pretty straightforward.\n\nA print connector is created to the 'file' /dev/usb/lp0, which is the usb adapter that the printer is connected to. The printer commands that are subsequently used (text(), feed(), cut()), stream the raw commands associated with those actions to the printer through that connection.\n\nNote: If you get an error about permissions when sending to /dev/usb/lp0 or something similiar to that, try running sudo chmod +777 /dev/usb/lp0 and seeing if that fixes it.\n\nUsing these methods, I can move on to connecting this with GitHub and populating the receipts with some actual data.\n\nGitHub makes it easy to listen to events on repos with webhooks. By going to one of my repo's settings page and navigating to the webhooks section, I can create a hook that will POST to a specific URL on a given action. For my case, I want to print out a ticket when a new issue is created, so I choose just the 'Issues' section. I also set the data type as JSON, since that's what I enjoy working with.\n\nBut before I continue, I need to have a URL that GitHub could send that POST request to. First, I ssh back into the Raspberry Pi and start up the local PHP server by using the -S flag in my project's directory:\n\nNow that it's running, I need a way to access that port on my Raspberry Pi, while it's on my local network. I don't really want to expose my home's IP address or worry about creating a pass through my router. So, I just ended up using ngrok to tunnel through to the exposed port.\n\nAfter that loads up, I copy the provided https url, and paste it in the GitHub webhook url field. Everything looks good, and I save the webhook. As soon as I save, there should be a test request that's sent out, ngrok accepts the request, tunnels it to the local PHP server, and another Hello, world! will print out.\n\nNow I'm ready to actually use the incoming request from GitHub to build out a ticket.\n\nNow I'll make some modifications to my code from earlier. First, I should discard anything that's not a POST request. So before initializing the FilePrintConnection, I add these lines:\n\nAnd after the FilePrintConnection and Printer initialization, I'll decode the entire JSON request from GitHub as an associative array:\n\nNow, I can use the printer methods from before and the data array from GitHub to build up the receipt I want! Using the Escpos library, formatting text requires a lot of repetitive code. For a small example, here's what a bold and underlined title of the issue, along with the plain text body, looks like:\n\nIf you'd like to see the entire code that I used to format my ticket in the tweet above, you can check it out on the GitHub repo.\n\nNow to test it out, all I have to do is go to the repository where I set up my webhook, create a new issue, and wait for the printer to deliver a ticket :magic:.\n\nAlright, so where to go from here? This is definitely a simple proof of concept, but we can expand on it a few different ways.\n\nFor the tickets themselves, a QR code could be added to link directly to the issue on GitHub. You could also add in more details from the issue itself like tags and severity.\n\nYou could also use this concept to handle basically any data coming from a webhook or through an API request. Like printing tickets from apps like Jira or Bugsnag, exceptions thrown from production applications, or even daily todo items and grocery lists!\n\nSo, what do you think? If you have any ideas for how you'd improve on this setup, or just have a question or comment, please let me know in the discussion below or on my Twitter!\n\nSubscribe using the form below and about 1-2 times a month you'll receive an email containing helpful hints, new packages, and interesting articles I've found on PHP, JavaScript, Docker and more.",

    "description": "Ever since a U.S. military cemetery in the southern Netherlands removed two displays recognizing Black troops who helped to liberate Europe from the Nazis, visitors have filled the guestbook with objections.  The move came after U.S.",
    "fullText": "MARGRATEN, Netherlands (AP) — Ever since a U.S. military cemetery in the southern Netherlands removed two displays recognizing Black troops who helped to liberate Europe from the Nazis, visitors have filled the guestbook with objections.\n\nSometime in the spring, the American Battle Monuments Commission, the U.S. government agency responsible for maintaining memorial sites outside of the United States, removed the panels from the visitors center at the American Cemetery in Margraten, the final resting place for roughly 8,300 U.S. soldiers, set in rolling hills near the border with Belgium and Germany.\n\nThe move came after U.S. President Donald Trump issued a series of executive orders ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs. “Our country will be woke no longer,” Trump said in an address to Congress in March.\n\nThe removal, carried out without public explanation, has angered Dutch officials, the families of U.S. soldiers and the local residents who honor the American sacrifice by caring for the graves.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands Joe Popolo seemed to support the removal of the displays. “The signs at Margraten are not intended to promote an agenda that criticizes America,” he wrote on social media following a visit to the cemetery after the controversy had erupted. Popolo declined a request for comment.\n\nThe displays highlighted the sacrifices of Black Americans\n\nOne display told the story of 23-year-old George H. Pruitt, a Black soldier buried at the cemetery, who died attempting to rescue a comrade from drowning in 1945. The other described the U.S. policy of racial segregation in place during World War II.\n\nSome 1 million Black soldiers enlisted in the U.S. military during the war, serving in separate units, mostly doing menial tasks but also fighting in some combat missions. An all-Black unit dug the thousands of graves in Margraten during the brutal 1944-45 season of famine in the German-occupied Netherlands known in the Hunger Winter.\n\nCor Linssen, the 79-year-old son of a Black American soldier and a Dutch mother, is one of those who opposes the removal of the panels.\n\nLinssen grew up some 30 miles (50 kilometers) away from the cemetery and although he didn’t learn who his father was until later in life, he knew he was the son of a Black soldier.\n\n“When I was born, the nurse thought something was wrong with me because I was the wrong color,” he told The Associated Press. “I was the only dark child at school.”\n\nLinssen together with a group of other children of Black soldiers, now all in their 70s and 80s, visited the cemetery in February 2025 to see the panels.\n\n“It’s an important part of history,” Linssen said. “They should put the panels back.\"\n\nThe decision was based on Trump's DEI policies\n\nAfter months of mystery around the disappearance of the panels, two media organizations — the Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA) and online media Dutch News — this month published emails obtained through a U.S. Freedom of Information Act request showing that Trump’s DEI policies directly prompted the commission to take down the panels.\n\nThe White House did not respond to queries from AP about the removed panels.\n\nThe American Battle Monuments Commission did not respond to queries from AP about the revelations. Earlier, the ABMC told the AP that the panel that discussed segregation “did not fall within (the) commemorative mission.''\n\nIt also said that the panel about Pruitt was “rotated” out. The replacement panel features Leslie Loveland, a white soldier killed in Germany in 1945, who is buried at Margraten.\n\nChair of the Black Liberators foundation and Dutch senator Theo Bovens said his organization, which pushed for the inclusion of the panels at the visitors center, was not informed that they were removed. He told AP it is “strange” that the U.S. commission feels the panels are not in their mission, as they placed them in 2024.\n\n“Something has changed in the United States,” he said.\n\nBovens, who is from the region around Margraten, is one of thousands of locals who tend to the graves at the cemetery. People who adopt a grave visit it regularly and leave flowers on the fallen soldier’s birthday and other holidays. The responsibility is often passed down through Dutch families, and there is a waiting list to adopt graves of the U.S. soldiers.\n\nThe locals remember the sacrifices of the Black soldiers\n\nBoth the city and the province where the cemetery is located have demanded the panels be returned. In November a Dutch television program recreated the panels and installed them outside the cemetery, where they were quickly removed by police. The show is now seeking a permanent location for them.\n\nThe Black Liberators is also looking to find a permanent location for a memorial for the Black soldiers who gave their lives to free the Dutch.\n\nOn America Square, in front of the Eijsden-Margraten city hall, there is a small park named for Jefferson Wiggins, a Black solider who, at age 19, dug many of the graves at Margraten when he was stationed in the Netherlands.\n\nIn his memoir, published posthumously in 2014, he describes burying the bodies of his white comrades who he was barred from fraternizing with while they were alive.\n\nWhen Black soldiers came to Europe in the Second World War, ’’what they found was people who accepted them, who welcomed them, who treated them as the heroes that they were. And that includes the Netherlands,″ said Linda Hervieux, whose book “Forgotten” chronicles Black soldiers who fought on D-Day and segregation they faced back home.\n\nThe removal of the panels, she said, “follows a historical pattern of writing out the stories of men and women of color in the United States.\"",

    "fullText": "A familiar fast-food destination on State Street in Boise went dark over the weekend. But something hot — in more ways than one — will brighten up its future.\n\nCarl’s Jr. just closed its prominent, standalone restaurant at 1700 W. State St., across from an Albertsons grocery store.\n\nSpicing up the building, Dave’s Hot Chicken plans to open there next.\n\nSpecializing in Nashville-style hot chicken tenders and sliders, Dave’s was founded in 2017 as a California pop-up. Since then, the fast-casual chain has exploded. “When a restaurant starts in an East Hollywood parking lot and ends up with nearly 1,000 locations in development, you know something epic is underway,” food website Tasting Table recently proclaimed. “Dave’s Hot Chicken has become the poster child for explosive growth in the restaurant industry, and 2025 is proving to be its biggest year yet.”\n\nIdaho franchisees Doug and Amy Davis introduced Dave’s Hot Chicken to the Gem State with a Meridian restaurant in 2022 and a Nampa store in 2024. But Doug Davis — the man who brought Buffalo Wild Wings to Idaho before parting ways with that brand in 2015 — has always had his eye on the City of Trees.\n\n“I will bring it to Boise,” he told the Statesman in early 2024. “I guarantee that.”\n\nBut North End fans of Dave’s Hot Chicken — not to mention Boise High School students — will have to be patient. “I hope to be open mid-August 2026,” Davis explained in a message.\n\nIt’s hard to view the Dave’s-for-Carl’s trade as anything less than a win for fast-food fans. And the neighborhood itself. The building, which is nearly 4,000 square feet, will be modernized by Dave’s Hot Chicken’s stylish street-mural look. “Our concept is a locally owned and operated franchise, deeply connected to the spirit of Boise and the North End,” according to information that Davis submitted to the city of Boise. “Public art reflects Boise’s unique character, and Dave’s street art embodies that spirit.”\n\nThe building also will be remodeled, “minimizing structural changes and optimizing existing infrastructure. The drive-thru will remain an essential service component and continue to operate under the new concept.\n\n“In addition to the main dining and kitchen areas, the project will incorporate approximately 1,500 square feet of currently unoccupied space into the restaurant’s footprint. Consistent with the approach taken at our Meridian location, this area will be repurposed to include a climate-controlled indoor/outdoor patio as well as a new conference room and storage space.\n\n“The patio will feature attractive garage-style doors, allowing the space to function as an open-air dining environment in favorable weather, while heating and cooling systems will ensure comfortable, year-round use.\n\n“Interior upgrades will include new finishes, equipment installations, and modifications to meet Dave’s Hot Chicken’s prototype standards. Exterior improvements will focus on refreshed branding, signage, and design enhancements that align with the franchise’s identity while complementing the surrounding area.”\n\nThe demise of Carl’s Jr. on State Street follows the closure of another location last year at 226 S. Broadway Ave. — the first Carl’s Jr. in Idaho. The year before that, Carl’s Jr. also closed at 4999 W. Glenwood St. in Garden City.\n\nBut if you’re craving a Carl’s Jr. hamburger? There are still plenty of options. The chain continues to operate Treasure Valley locations in Boise, Meridian, Eagle and Nampa.",

    "fullText": "LAKE SUPERIOR, MI - A remote Michigan lighthouse sitting far offshore in Lake Superior has recorded one of today’s highest wind gusts amid a severe winter storm and blizzard conditions across the Upper Peninsula.\n\nWeather equipment on the Stannard Rock Lighthouse recorded a wind gust of 69 mph this morning. According to lists compiled by the National Weather Service, it’s the third-highest gust recorded so far during this storm. The highest gusts have been recorded as 72 mph in Sault Ste. Marie and 70 mph at Ford River near Escanaba.\n\nThe historic Stannard Rock Lighthouse sits off the eastern shore of Michigan’s Keweenaw Peninsula. Today, a Gale Warning has been issued for those Lake Superior waters until later tonight. Wind gusts as high as 57 mph are possible today, amid waves reaching 25 feet.\n\nBuilt 24 miles from the Upper Peninsula shoreline, Stannard Rock is considered the lighthouse farthest from shore in the contiguous United States. That has earned it the grim moniker as “The Loneliest Place in the World.”\n\nHistory of “The Loneliest Place in the World.”\n\nBuilt in 1883, the Stannard Rock station is well-known among Great Lakes lighthouse lore lovers. Its exposed crib - or base structure - is considered one of the Top 10 engineering feats in the U.S., according to the National Park Service. And it was built to mark a huge underwater reef that was considered one of the most dangerous obstacles to shipping in Lake Superior. The top of a large underwater mountain was found to sit just 4 feet from the surface of the water in some spots.\n\nHere’s a little more history to give you a feel for this place, courtesy of a social media post from the U.S. Coast Guard Station Marquette:\n\n“The old keepers told terrible tales of life on the Rock. Violent northwest storms sent 30-foot waves smashing into the tower and spray cascading over the lantern room 110 feet above the Lake. Louis Wilks from Marquette holds the record for consecutive time spent on the Rock – 99 days. No other keeper even approached this remarkable feat. The men were rotated off the Rock, three weeks on and one off. In 1939, the U.S. Coast Guard took over the lighthouse and overwhelming loneliness remained a problem.”\n\nThe lighthouse was automated in 1962, a year after a fatal fire and explosion that left survivors stranded at Stannard Rock for days until they were noticed by a passing ship. In 1971, the lighthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nIt remains a working aid to navigation. While the lighthouse is closed to the public, it can be seen by boat or airplane.\n\nIf emergency repairs are needed in the winter, the U.S Coast Guard will use a helicopter to fly a team to the lighthouse.\n\nDetroit Forecast: Arctic cold and more snow ahead\n\n2 more rounds of lake effect snow before New Year’s Day\n\nNearly 100,000 remain without power across Michigan after one-two punch of ice, high winds",

    "description": "Top 10: Fastest planes to take off from water",
    "fullText": "Among the wildest sights in aviation is a high-performance aircraft taking off from a lake or the sea.\n\nThe exciting ability to take off from water frees aeroplanes from needing a runway, airfield, or airport. It offers incredible flexibility but comes at a huge cost, as a seaplane must also function as a boat.\n\nThis adds weight and involves large hydrodynamic, aerodynamic, configuration, and structural compromises, yet somehow, quite miraculously, some were built that offered impressive speed. One even held the absolute world airspeed record for all types of aeroplanes… Let’s take a look:\n\nThe German attack on Norway in 1940 and the alarming lack of RAF airfields to use in the resultant campaign made the need for a floatplane fighter one of the highest orders. An urgent scheme to fit floats from the Blackburn Roc to the Spitfire was hatched, but before these new Spitfire floatplanes even flew, the Norwegian campaign was over, and there was a more significant need for landplanes.\n\nThe converted Spitfires were changed back to regular wheeled undercarriage. But this handy idea refused to go away. Subsequently, the Spitfire floatplane was looked at again when war in the Pacific against Japan kicked off in late 1941, and this time a Mk.V, was converted.\n\nIn 1944, a Spitfire Mark IX (serial MJ892) powered by a Merlin 45 engine was fitted with floats. The result was spectacular: the machine reached 377mph, making it the fastest floatplane of the war. Sadly, the concept was shelved, and despite becoming the third fastest floatplane ever built, the waterborne Spitfire was abandoned in late 1945.\n\nThe Saunders-Roe SR.45 Princess was a magnificent machine of epic proportions. Weighing 86,000 kg, the same as 33 Spitfires, and with a greater wingspan than a Boeing 747, blessed with an endurance of 15 hours and a range of almost 6000 miles, the Princess was utterly impressive.\n\nThe Princess was planned as a luxurious airliner to serve the transatlantic route. To carry 100 passengers over such a long route in style, the Princess needed to be big and heavy and required a massive amount of power. Eight massive Bristol Proteus turboprop engines were mounted in four ‘coupled’ pairs, along with two regular uncoupled Proteus.\n\nThe Princess first flew in 1952, unfortunately coinciding with the dawn of the land-based jet airliner age. Large airports and runways, able to accommodate the far more efficient land planes, were becoming increasingly common. The Princess, though impressive, was the last and grandest example of a dying concept that was rapidly becoming obsolete.\n\nRemarkably, despite the myriad compromises a flying boat must endure, the Princess was capable of a racy 380 mph, a mere 69mph slower than the jet-powered land-based de Havilland Comet I. Saunders-Roe were nothing if not persistent and considered even larger (jet-powered) flying boats before finally accepting defeat, and moving to another technological cul-de-sac: mixed propulsion fighters.\n\nBefore RJ Mitchell designed the Spitfire, he unleashed a series of stupendously fast floatplanes for the Schneider Trophy race. The S.5 had won the race in 1927 but was not considered competitive for the race of 1929 and Mitchell designed a successor powered by a new and very powerful Rolls-Royce V12 engine.\n\nThe new S.6 was delivered only a month before the race, mainly due to problems with the Rolls-Royce ‘R’ engine. Although offering huge potential, it was a capricious unit but had finally been tamed to an acceptable state of reliability by race day.\n\nThe S.6 obliterated the competition to win the 1929 Schneider Trophy, coming in 60mph faster than the second placed Macchi MC.67. Further tweaks to the R-type engine led it to deliver a huge 2350 hp in the S.6B which won the trophy outright for the UK in 1931.\n\nAs a final flourish, the sensational S.6B proved it was as fast as it was beautiful by setting the world absolute speed record at 407.5mph, becoming the fastest man-made vehicle yet built in the process. Incredibly, it remains one of the two fastest floatplanes ever constructed nearly 100 years later.\n\nJet seaplanes are among the most exotic aircraft types, with only a handful of designs ever having entered actual service. In fact, I’m pretty sure we can name them all from memory: the Beriev Be-10 and Beriev Be-200 – wait, I think that’s it; only two?\n\nThe only one remaining in service today is the Be-200. Based on the rather unfortunate Beriev A-40 (which we’ll cover later), the Be-200 first flew in 1998. It was designed for various roles, including firefighting, air ambulance, search and rescue, maritime patrol and transportation duties.\n\nOnly around 20 of these rather pretty amphibians have been built so far. The first operational use of the Be-200 was in 2004, when SOREM deployed a Be-200ES from Sardinia. The aircraft, flown by a joint Russian-Italian flight crew, performed over 100 flights and dropped 324 tons of water to counter four forest fires.\n\nSince then, the aircraft has fought fires worldwide, in Israel, Portugal, Greece, Serbia, Russia and other locations. It can carry a maximum of 12,000 litres (3,200 US gal) of water. The Be-200 is operated by Algeria, Azerbaijan, and Russia.\n\nOn 23 October 1934, Francesco Agello became the fastest man that had ever been when he took the stunningly beautiful MC.72 to a speed of 440.682 mph (709.209km/h). Packed into the long nose of the MC.72 was a 2800-horsepower monster: the engine is two separate units really, mounted inline, each driving one of the contra-rotating propellers.\n\nThe luscious Italian Macchi-Castoldi M.C.72 combined a wealth of innovative features with outstanding beauty and a quite astonishing performance. It was built to win the Schneider race, a fiercely competitive international seaplane contest encouraging rapid technological progress in aeroplane development.\n\nAlthough conceived to contest the 1931 Schneider Trophy, the M.C.72 ruled itself out by being too late - however it did go on to set an outright speed record that stood for five years. The journey to success wasn’t easy though, with Fiat’s A.S.6 24-cylinder engine being the main culprit.\n\nThe A.S.6 was an alarming idea: take two highly-strung V12 engines and bolt them back-to-back, having one drive one element of a contra-rotating prop and the other drive the second, with no direct link between the throttles. A speed of 440.68mph was set in 1933, only bettered in 1939 (by a German landplane), and it’s still the case that no piston-engined seaplane has travelled faster.\n\nThe Beriev Aircraft Company started as a Soviet design bureau specialising in amphibious aircraft. When the jet age arrived, the Beriev had been building seaplanes for some time. The new technology promised a massive leap in speed, so Beriev set about designing a jet-flying boat.\n\nThe R-1 first flew on 20 May 1952, powered by two Klimov VK-1 turbojet engines, each rated at 26.5 kilonewtons (5950 lbf). Capable of an impressive 500 mph, and armed with two forward-firing and two tail-mounted 23-mm cannon, and up to 1000 kg of munitions. The single prototype suffered from severe vibrations and instability on water and crashed in 1953.\n\nThe Soviet Beriev A-40 amphibious jet flying boat first flew in 1986, and it was intended that it would replace the Beriev Be-12 (and land-based Ilyushin Il-38) in the anti-submarine warfare role. Between 1989 and 1998, the Beriev A-40 set 140 in-class world records.\n\nVarious attempts were made to get the aircraft into Russian service, but they all failed. The most recent effort of a modernised version involved new Ukrainian-made propfan engines, an effort which ended with Russian aggression against Ukraine; Russian forces bombed and destroyed the engine plant in May 2022.\n\nThe Japanese floatplane fighters of the war showed that the concept could work, at least to some degree, in the calmer parts of the Pacific. British manufacturer Saunders-Roe thought they could do one better, negating the seaplane’s inherent performance disadvantage with the latest technology: the jet engine.\n\nCreating an aircraft capable of 512 mph with four 20-mm cannon would have proved an awesome, perhaps unbeatable, opponent to Japanese seaplanes and flying boats. Timing was against the aircraft; however, with the war winding down, the company looked away from this military project, instead devoting their resources to the huge, long-range, civilian flying boat, the Princess. This delayed the type’s first flight until 1947.\n\nThe aircraft proved impressive – it had great handling, good agility and was pleasant to fly Notably, the prototypes were fitted with the first two examples of Martin-Baker production ejection seats. However, there wasn’t a great deal of need for it by this time, and two months later, a carrier fighter that was faster still (the 600mph Hawker Sea Hawk) took to the air.\n\nThe Royal Navy wasn’t very interested in this eccentric design, believing in the conventional carrier concept. It was briefly brought back to life in 1950 to assess its utility for the Korean War, but things had moved on, and it would have been no match for the latest fighters. The ‘Squirt’, as it was affectionately known by its creators, was not to be. Three examples were built.\n\nThe Beriev Be-10 ‘Mallow’ was a turbojet-powered flying boat designed for reconnaissance, bomber, torpedo attack and mine-laying missions. The first flight of this dramatic-looking aeroplane with its swept-back wing was on 20 June 1956 from Gelendzhik, on the Black Sea, in Russia.\n\nThe first turbo-jet flying boat to enter service, the Be-10 was a massive step up in performance from the piston-engined flying boats that preceded it, like the Be-6. Offering a top speed more than twice as fast, it smashed 12 in-class world records in speed, altitude, and payload, which still stand today.\n\nIt was powered by two Lyul’ka AL-7B turbojets, each rated at 71.26 kilonewtons (16,000lbf). Unlike other AL-7 installations on various fighters, the AL-7B had stainless steel compressor blades and no afterburner fitted. It was armed with four 23-mm automatic cannons, with a maximum bombload of 3,000kg.\n\nIt was initially beset with a multitude of problems, including engine water and gun-gas ingestion, quality control issues, and it suffered a relatively high accident rate. Only 28 aircraft were made and served only two squadrons within the 977th Independent Naval Long-Range Reconnaissance Air Regiment.\n\nTwo 1950s quad-jet bombers were designed for high speed at low level: one was the British Valiant B2, and the other was the far more exotic American Martin P6M SeaMaster. This was planned as a strategic bomber and minelayer for the U.S. Navy, able to fly just above the waves at near supersonic speeds and destroy enemy submarines in their homeports.\n\nThis high performance ‘on the deck’ was excellent for any aircraft that first flew in 1955, even more so for a machine weighting an 44,300 kg that could take-off from water. Intended as part of a new Seaplane Strike Force, the SeaMaster was a bold design that inherited the t-tail (or tee tail) and rotating weapons bay from the failed Martin XB-51 bomber.\n\nThe SeaMaster was late, over budget, riddled with technical challenges, and was cancelled. The new Polaris Submarine-launched ballistic missile offered a cheaper and less risky alternative. The project cost a staggering $400 million, equivalent to almost $5 billion in today’s money.\n\nOnly 16 SeaMasters were built. The project’s failure drove the Glenn L. Martin Company, established in 1917, out of the aircraft business, despite attempts to market an extremely exciting (and unbuilt) civil version, the SeaMistress.\n\nHigh-performance jet combat aircraft of the 1950s required long runways, and tended to have rather unforgiving handling characteristics. This made them dangerous for land-based operations; aircraft carrier operations were even more hazardous. Convair believed the solution was a fast jet seaplane that took off from water.\n\nThe sleek delta-winged Sea Dart launching or landing on the ocean was one of the most compelling sights, even in a decade bursting with aerospace spectacle. Thrust skywards by two jet engines, the Sea Dart was designed as a fighter interceptor for the United States Navy.\n\nWith its delta wing and sleek uncluttered lines, it was a revelation when it appeared in 1953. It looked a world apart from the seaplanes of the war that had only ended eight years earlier. Despite being a seaplane, it was only marginally slower than the fastest aircraft flying and could be dived to Mach 1.25, making it the only supersonic seaplane in history.\n\nHowever, even higher speeds were desired, including supersonic speed in level flight, which it could not achieve. It was also relatively sluggish in agility. Even worse, its legged ‘hydro-ski’ take-offs almost shook the poor pilot to death. Still, it was a fantastic machine, capable of 695mph. Five examples were produced.\n\nFollow Joe Coles on Substack, Twitter X  or Blue Sky.

    "description": "Having a scalable truck-based catapult concept for land-launched larger drone operations could open up new operational possibilities.",
    "fullText": "New imagery of Chinese catapult-capable low-observable combat drones, or possibly mockups thereof, together with some unusual trucks, may point to plans to launch them from the ground, as well as ships. A modular, truck-mounted electromagnetic catapult system would offer a valuable additional way to launch larger drones, especially in areas with limited access to traditional runways. General Atomics in the United States has proposed a roughly similar concept in the past, leveraging technology developed for the U.S. Navy’s Ford class aircraft carriers.\n\nPictures of the drones sitting dockside at Hudong-Zhonghua shipyard in Shanghai first began circulating online late last week. The presence of the super-sized Type 076 amphibious assault ship Sichuan in drydock nearby still raises the possibility of plans for trials aboard that ship, which features a single electromagnetic catapult, as was discussed in TWZ‘s initial reporting here. A medium-sized cargo ship loaded with containerized vertical launchers, as well as sensors and close-in defense systems, which emerged last week, has also been moored at this yard recently.\n\nThough the drones are still under wraps in the new images, we do now have a better look at their overall design. This includes nose landing gear with bars that clearly show the design is intended for catapult launch. There is also a notable outline of a fairing under the nose, though no further details about that feature can be discerned at present.\n\nIt is interesting to note that a mockup of a drone called the FH-97, shown at China’s Zhuhai Airshow in 2021, was depicted with an electro-optical sensor in a stealthy gold-plated windowed enclosure installed under its nose. The overall design of the FH-97, which is at least heavily inspired by the XQ-58A Valkyrie from U.S. drone maker Kratos, is similar in many other respects, at least in broad strokes, to what has now been seen at the Hudong-Zhonghua shipyard. The XQ-58 and FH-97 are both notably smaller designs. There are also similarities to two Chinese ‘loyal wingman’ type drone designs, commonly referred to presently as the Type C and Type E, which emerged around a huge military parade in Beijing back in September.\n\nWell, back from work and back to this strange picture:\n\nI start with my layman's attempt to sort them a bit + adding the names according to Huitong's CMA-Blog.\n\n1. pic.twitter.com/GPXjD2q1r3\n\n— @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) September 10, 2025\n\nMore interestingly, the new pictures from Hudong-Zhonghua shipyard show at least three eight-wheeled trucks that look designed to lock together seamlessly in a chain. Doing so also appears to form a continuous flat surface across the top. One of the drones is seen loaded at the rear of one of the trucks with its nose gear bar locked into what looks to be a catapult shuttle.\n\nBesides the cabs in front, the sides of the trucks are largely open, showing elaborate electrical systems and large amounts of heavy exposed wiring. There is a cylindrical drum above each wheel, which could be part of an independent articulating suspension system capable of self-leveling. They might also serve another purpose, which we will come back to later on.\n\nA satellite image taken yesterday, which TWZ obtained from Planet Labs, shows what looks to be at least four of the trucks parked close together in a line along one of the piers at Hudong-Zhonghua shipyard. Despite the low resolution, a drone is plainly seen loaded on one of the trucks. Another one of the ‘loyal wingman’ drones is visible immediately behind the row of trucks, in line with what is seen in the pictures taken at ground level. Four more of the swept-wing drones are also visible further down the pier. A Wing Loong-type drone, similar to the Q-1/Q-9 Predator/Reaper series, is also present.\n\nAltogether, there is the potential that these trucks could be part of a mobile ground-based electromagnetic catapult system. The cylinders and wiring seen on the trucks might be electromagnets and/or other supporting components. Any such system would also need to be self-leveling to help ensure a clean launch.\n\nAt the same time, they could still just be transporters, though the design looks far more elaborate than would be required for that purpose alone. The trucks could possibly be designed to serve both functions.\n\nThere is the additional question of why, if this is indeed a ground-based electromagnetic catapult system, it has been brought down to Hudong-Zhonghua shipyard at all. This is not the environment in which one would expect such a system to be employed, and there are no clear signs as of yet that it is there as part of a larger display.\n\nRegardless, the basic idea of employing an aircraft carrier-type catapult launch system on land is not new. China itself, as well as the United States, has built steam and electromagnetic-powered catapults at land-based test sites for test, evaluation, and training purposes. The U.S. Marine Corps actually employed an ‘aircraft carrier on land’ with catapults and arresting gear, called the Short Airfield for Tactical Support (SATS) system, operationally during the Vietnam War, which you can read more about here.\n\nAt least one company in China, Tiantao Technology, has been openly talking about plans for a ground-based electromagnetic catapult system made up of modular wheeled segments since at least August of this year. Renderings have shown 10-wheeled sections that do have some broad similarities to, but that also are distinctly different from the eight-wheeled trucks seen at Hudong-Zhonghua shipyard. The eight-wheeled trucks, if they are part of a mobile electromagnetic catapult system, could also reflect an early developmental iteration.\n\nTiantao Technology has also reportedly said the system will be capable of launching uncrewed aircraft weighing up to around 2.2 tons (two metric tons). This is lighter than the expected takeoff weights of ‘loyal wingman’ type drones China has shown to date, based on the known specifications of comparably-sized Western designs. For example, the stated maximum launch weight of the XQ-58 is three tons, according to Kratos. As another point of comparison, the Chinese GJ-11, a larger flying-wing uncrewed combat air vehicle (UCAV), a catapult-capable version of which is now in development, reportedly has a payload capacity of around two tons. China’s J-15 family of crewed carrier-based fighters, derived from the Su-33 Flanker, each weighs around 19 tons (17.5 metric tons) empty without any fuel or ordnance, as well.\n\nHere are apparently some specs of truck mounted EMALS\n\nCan launch 2T mass with 150kN thrust https://t.co/xoxLOYO0oNpic.twitter.com/vEXM2iSeq4\n\n— Hûrin (@Hurin92) December 29, 2025\n\nIt is possible that the modular design of Tiantao Technology’s ground-based catapult system could allow for configurations capable of launching heavier designs. A core benefit of electromagnetic catapults over steam-powered ones, in general, is their ability to be more fine-tuned in terms of the forces they exert on any aircraft during launch. The capabilities of a modular system would also be dependent on its exact configuration, including how long the catapult track is overall. Tiantao Technology has said the total length of its system could be scaled between roughly 65 and 196 feet (20 and 60 meters). What limitations there might be on simply adding more segments to increase launch capacity are unknown.\n\nChina’s aircraft carrier electromagnetic catapult is incredibly cool — the moment the catapult comes to an instant stop looks like a space jump straight out of a sci-fi movie. pic.twitter.com/VWdLOEzgzS\n\n— JacksonS (@shrmodelx) December 25, 2025\n\nTiantao Technology has also shown models and renderings of truck and trailer-mounted electromagnetic catapults for launching even smaller drones. How much progress it has made in the actual development of any of the systems to date is unclear. Other firms in China could very well be working along similar lines, too.\n\nAll this being said, a ground-based electromagnetic catapult system capable of launching even two-ton drones still opens doors to new operational possibilities. This is a capability that could be especially valuable in expeditionary scenarios or other contexts in which access to traditional runways is limited. A mobile system would also offer a new way to push at least a certain tier of airpower closer to the front lines, and help keep it in close proximity where it could be more responsive, even as the dimensions of the battlefield evolve. Less transit time would translate to more on-station endurance even for smaller, shorter-range drones.\n\nAnother general benefit of electromagnetic catapults over steam-powered types is the shorter reset time, which, by extension, increases sortie generation rates. How Tiantao Technology envisions drones being loaded on its ground-based system is unclear. It is possible that a truck preloaded with a drone could drive up, lock into the rear of the track, launch, and then detach to make way for the next one, offering additional benefits when it comes to operational tempo. Being able to break the launch system into multiple parts and disperse it when not in use would create targeting challenges for enemies and help increase survivability, as well.\n\nAs TWZ regularly notes, China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has major standing requirements to be able to conduct island-hopping campaigns against various potential opponents in the Pacific, where a shore-based electromagnetic catapult system could be particularly relevant. The PLA is also postured to fight in highly remote and high-altitude areas along its disputed western border with India, where access to established runways is also often limited.\n\nThese kinds of operational scenarios are driving the pursuit of aircraft, especially uncrewed types, with reduced runway requirements or entirely runway-independent designs by many armed forces globally. This includes the U.S. military. A ground-based electromagnetic catapult is just one way of approaching this operational need. There are runway-independent drones already on the market today that are launched with the help of expendable rocket motors or pneumatic catapults. However, these methods impose their own limitations, especially when it comes to launch weight and payload capacity. Rocket-assisted takeoffs come along with the additional risks associated with using that kind of propellant, as well as the stresses that are imparted on the aircraft being launched. The rockets are also consumed on launch, requiring a steady supply of them at any operating location. Kratos has notably demonstrated a special launch trolley for its primarily rocket-launched XQ-58 that allows for traditional runway takeoffs. The company is also developing a version of that design with built-in landing gear, to offer increased flexibility.\n\nIn the context of what may now be in development in China, there is the additional question about how drones might be recovered after launch from a ground-based electromagnetic catapult. Tiantao Technology does not appear to have elaborated yet on this part of the expected concept of operations for its system. The aforementioned concept that General Atomics put forward paired an electromagnetic catapult with a separate arrested landing system, also based on technology developed for the U.S. Navy’s Ford class aircraft carriers. As noted, the Vietnam War-era SATS system also included arresting gear. The U.S. military and other armed forces globally already employ deployable arresting gear, especially to enable crewed tactical jet operations from far-flung locations with shorter runways. Drones could recover at tertiary bases, or be designed to land via parachute or some other runway-independent method, as well. The system could also be used to launch long-range one-way attack drones that would not be designed for recovery at all.\n\nThere is also a question of power and other logistical requirements. However, a ground-based electromagnetic catapult system that is not required to support all of the different types in a full carrier air wing, especially larger crewed aircraft, would inherently require far less capability.\n\nIt is also worth noting that a modular electromagnetic catapult system might be usable on ships that do not have this capability built into their design. As mentioned, the drones and trucks seen at Hudong-Zhonghua shipyard were spotted near a cargo ship loaded with various containerized weapons and other systems. A drone launch capability of some kind would be a logical addition to a vessel with that configuration. At the same time, whether or not any catapult system made up of multiple segmented components would be stable enough for use on a ship rocking back and forth at sea is unclear.\n\nAs a general note, major new military capabilities often emerge in China during the time between Christmas and New Year’s. This is also something that happens with the clear acquiescence of authorities in Beijing if they are not outright announced through official channels. Hudong-Zhonghua shipyard is an obvious area of interest for observers, and Chinese authorities do not appear to have taken any special steps to conceal the recent appearance of the drone mockups or the trucks.\n\nMore details about the trucks, and their exact function, as well as the drones, may now begin to emerge.\n\nContact the author: joe@twz.com",

    "fullText": "TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — It is a soulful folk song, filled with feeling and history: A love-stricken young man tells God about his hopes and dreams of happiness. Generations of Uyghurs, the Turkic ethnic minority in China’s Xinjiang region, have played it at parties and weddings.\n\nBut today, if they download it, play it or share it online, they risk ending up in prison.\n\n“Besh pede,” a popular Uyghur folk ballad, is among dozens of Uyghur-language songs that have been deemed “problematic” by Xinjiang authorities, according to a recording of a meeting held by police and other local officials in the historic city of Kashgar last October. The recording was shared exclusively with The Associated Press by the Norway-based nonprofit Uyghur Hjelp.\n\nDuring the meeting, authorities warned residents that those who listened to banned songs, stored them on devices or shared them on social media could face prison. Attendees were also instructed to avoid phrases like “As-salamu alaykum,” the greeting common among Muslims, and to replace the popular farewell phrase “Allahqa amanet,” which means “May God keep you safe,” with “May the Communist Party protect you.”\n\nThe policy has been corroborated by interviews with former Xinjiang residents, whose family members, friends and acquaintances have been detained for playing and sharing Uyghur music. AP has also obtained rare access to the court verdict of a Uyghur music producer sentenced last year to three years in prison for uploading to his cloud account songs deemed sensitive.\n\nHow a single song fits into a broad crackdown\n\nThe renewed crackdown on cultural expression in Xinjiang, classified as an “autonomous region” but tightly controlled by the central government, suggests a continuation of the past decade's repressive policies. They have culminated in the extrajudicial detention, between 2017 and 2019, of at least 1 million Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in China such as Kazakhs, Kyrgyz and Huis, rights activists and foreign governments say.\n\nIn 2022, the United Nations accused China of rights violations it said might amount to crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, where Beijing also faces allegations of forced labor, forced sterilizations and family separations as part of a broader assimilation campaign.\n\nThe Chinese government maintains its policies in Xinjiang rooted out terrorism and religious extremism after sporadic bouts of violence rocked the region in previous decades. Beijing doubled down on that narrative in particular after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks brought antiterror policies into the accepted global mainstream.\n\n“The Chinese government has cracked down on violent terrorist crimes and eradicated the breeding ground for religious extremism in accordance with the law, resolutely safeguarding Xinjiang’s development and stability,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.\n\nIt added that “anti-China forces” have “maliciously hyped up issues related to Xinjiang,” including by “linking audio and video recordings of Xinjiang departments cracking down on the propaganda of violent terrorism and religious extremism in accordance with the law to specific regions, ethnicities, and religions.”\n\nReached by phone, a Xinjiang government official wouldn't confirm whether a faxed request for comment had arrived and did not pick up subsequent calls from AP.\n\nA sign of continued repression in Xinjiang\n\nAfter facing international backlash and sanctions over the alleged arbitrary internment of ethnic minorities, Beijing in late 2019 claimed the detention camps were closed and life had returned to normal in the region. China now aims to refashion Xinjiang into a destination for tourism.\n\nAlthough many of the more glaring signs of repression such as internment camps and frequent traffic checkpoints appear to have been decommissioned, the list of banned songs indicates repression in Xinjiang continues, albeit more subtly, said Rian Thum, a senior lecturer in East Asian history at the University of Manchester.\n\nOther, less conspicuous forms of control include the expansion of boarding schools, where middle-schoolers are educated while separated from their families and learn almost exclusively in Mandarin Chinese, and random checks of phones for sensitive material are common.\n\nChinese authorities, Thum said, seem to be normalizing a policy for long-term control in Xinjiang.\n\n“I’m not at all surprised to hear these accounts of people either being threatened with detention or being detained or imprisoned for listening to the wrong music,” he said. “It’s the kind of thing that hasn’t stopped.”\n\nSeven categories of ‘problematic’ songs\n\nDuring the Kashgar meeting, authorities played a prerecorded message warning residents against listening to, downloading and sharing seven categories of so-called problematic songs.\n\nThey range from traditional folk ballads such as “Besh pede” to newer tunes that emerged from the Uyghur diaspora. “Besh pede” was flagged for its religious content, though the song hardly incites religious extremism, said Rachel Harris, a professor of ethnomusicology at SOAS University of London.\n\nReligion is referenced in the context of romantic tropes, with exhortations such as “Oh, God, I love you!” said Harris, who focuses on Uyghur culture.\n\n“That’s very clearly the problem with it,\" she said.\n\nTargeting religious expression has been a cornerstone of China’s crackdown. The Communist Party is suspicious of any community organizing, especially as it pertains to religions. Over the past decade, residents have been detained for praying, fasting and storing religious books; mosques have been repurposed or stripped of their authentic role.\n\nMusic \"became part of my upbringing, and removing that is like removing the soul,” said Rahima Mahmut, a Uyghur singer and activist in London who performs songs with religious connotations abroad.\n\nEven songs once featured on state TV have been banned. “As-salamu alaykum,” a pop tune that starts with the Islamic greeting recited in the style of a call to prayer, was performed on the talent show “The Voice of the Silk Road,” a spinoff of “The Voice,” on state-run Xinjiang Television.\n\nThe performance aired in 2016, the year China started amping up its campaign of repression against Uyghurs. Now, the tune is prohibited for “forcing people to believe in religion.”\n\nAnother category of problematic songs: those “inciting terrorism, extremism and smearing the Chinese Communist Party’s rule of Xinjiang.” Among the tunes listed is “Yanarim Yoq,” a song based on the poem “No Road Back Home” by the imprisoned Uyghur poet Abduqadir Jalalidin. The sorrowful song, evoking entrapment and hopelessness, has spread across the diaspora in recent years; one of its most popular renditions is performed by the Turkish artists Kilich and Yenilmes.\n\n“Atilar,” or “Forefathers,” by the famed Uyghur musician Abdurehim Heyit, is also accused of inciting terrorism and extremism. The nationalistic song was likely flagged for describing the Uyghur forefathers as martyrs ready for battle, Harris said.\n\nHeyit, like many other Uyghur cultural elites, was detained at the height of China’s campaign in Xinjiang. Many remain in detention.\n\nIn fact, a common denominator across the banned songs is that many were written or performed by imprisoned Uyghur musicians, said Elise Anderson, a nonresident senior fellow at the New Lines Institute who specializes in Uyghur issues.\n\nAnderson isn't certain that every artist associated with a banned song has been detained, but “at least a number of them have,” she said. “I think just by association with those individuals, those songs are going to be seen as — you know — dangerous, sensitive.”\n\nThree years in prison for uploading songs\n\nAuthorities at the Kashgar meeting said those found with the songs would be “heavily prosecuted” but did not specify punishment — something that gives authorities flexibility in enforcement. The prerecorded message gave the example of several people who had served 10 days in detention for being found with the banned songs.\n\nFor Uyghur music producer Yashar Xiaohelaiti, punishment has been much more severe.\n\nThe 27-year-old was detained in 2023 in Bole, a city in Xinjiang, on charges of promoting extremism. According to his verdict, Xiaohelaiti wrote and produced 42 “problematic” songs, which he uploaded to his account on NetEase Cloud Music, a Chinese streaming service. He was also convicted of downloading eight “problematic” e-books, according to the document. He received three years in prison and a 3,000 yuan ($420) fine.\n\nTwo Uyghurs interviewed by AP said they brushed up against the songs ban themselves. A man who asked that his name not be revealed, fearing repercussions, said he was called into the police station and his phone searched after he commented on the social media post of another Uyghur living abroad. While at the police station, he said he spoke to others who had been summoned specifically for storing or sharing certain Uyghur songs.\n\nSeparately, a former official from Xinjiang said a family friend was sentenced to more than 10 years in prison for playing traditional Uyghur instruments and singing Uyghur songs. Several family members and friends who watched the performance were also sentenced, she said. AP could not independently verify the interviewees’ claims.\n\nIn a separate incident, the official said two teenagers were detained after sharing Uyghur songs online.\n\n“Because they sent each other a Uyghur song on WeChat, they were arrested,” the former cadre said, referring to the teens. “I remember it very clearly. At the time we were saying, ‘What song were they listening to?’ How could they be arrested for listening to a song?’”\n\nAP journalist Dake Kang in Beijing contributed to this story.",

The two neighboring countries have no formal diplomatic ties and their joint border has remained closed since the 1990s.\n\nThe two countries however, agreed to work toward normalization in 2021, appointing special envoys to explore steps toward reconciliation and reopening the frontier. Those talks have progressed in parallel with efforts to ease tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan.\n\nTurkey supported Azerbaijan during its 2020 conflict with Armenia for control of the Karabakh region, known internationally as Nagorno-Karabakh, a territorial dispute that had lasted nearly four decades.\n\nThe Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement posted on social platform X that Ankara and Yerevan agreed that holders of diplomatic, special and service passports from both countries would be able to obtain electronic visas free of charge as of Jan. 1.\n\n“On this occasion, Turkey and Armenia reaffirm once again their commitment to continue the normalization process between the two countries with the goal of achieving full normalization without any preconditions,” the ministry said.\n\nTurkey and Armenia also have a more than century-old dispute over the deaths of an estimated 1.5 million Armenians in massacres, deportations and forced marches that began in 1915 in Ottoman Turkey. Historians widely view the event as genocide.\n\nTurkey denies the deaths constituted genocide, saying the toll has been inflated and those killed were victims of civil war and unrest. It has lobbied to prevent countries from officially recognizing the massacres as genocide.",

    "fullText": "A teen who faced deportation in Denmark has said 54-year-old tech billionaire Elon Musk’s remarks about her “hotness” are “crazy.”\n\nIn a now-deleted X post from Sunday, Musk commented on the story of Audrey Morris, a now-19-year-old U.S. native who was at risk of deportation from the country where she’s mostly lived since she was 9 years old.\n\n“8 or above level hotness should get an exemption,” Musk wrote with a laughing emoji.\n\nMorris said she wasn’t “surprised” by Musk’s comment, but that “it’s definitely crazy.”\n\n“From the beginning, the second that my case was kind of made public, it has been about appearances and because, ‘oh, she’s blonde and she’s white!’ And so the thing he said in of itself wasn’t shocking to me, but coming from him, yes, it was definitely...I was floored,” she told the Daily Beast.\n\nThe Independent has reached out for comment from Musk and Morris.\n\nAccording to the Danish newspaper, Århus Stiftstidende, Morris has lived in Aarhus, a city on Denmark’s east coast, for most of her life.\n\nThe newspaper reported last January that Danish authorities had decided not to extend her residence permit as an accompanying family member because she was not living with her mother while completing high school in Viborg, about an hour’s drive northwest of Aarhus. At the time, Morris’ application for permanent residence was being processed.\n\n“It would’ve been really cool if he commented something like, ‘Oh wow, look how many academic things she’s reached,’ or whatever. That would’ve been great. It could have been so helpful,” Morris, originally from Los Angeles, said of Musk.\n\nBut she said “if this just at least brings it to the attention of anyone who cares, then I’m fine with being embarrassed a little bit. That’s okay.”\n\nThe Daily Beast reported Morris was ultimately given a 10-year residency permit but was denied citizenship.\n\nMusk, who had a small stint in the White House as head of Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency before his public fall out with the president, has made his stance on illegal immigration known, saying during the Biden administration that the influx of undocumented migrants was “crushing the country.”\n\nBut the Tesla and SpaceX CEO, who was born in South Africa and eventually gained American citizenship, has defended legal immigration, specifically H1-B visas. Musk said during a podcast with entrepreneur Nikhil Kamath that aired in late November that his companies use the temporary employment program because of the “scarcity of talented people.”",

    "title": "Do You Remember The Defunct Mexican Chain That Was Once The 2nd-Largest In America?",
    "description": "This Mexican restaurant chain was all the rage in the 1990s, but what went wrong? Here's what we know about this once-popular spot for Mexican food.",
    "fullText": "There are plenty of defunct '90s restaurant chains that should have stuck around longer, most of which quietly faded into oblivion before we had one last bite of our favorites. Don Pablo's might come to mind; it was the second-largest Mexican chain in America in the '90s, after all. During its heyday, it served 20 states with over 100 locations, which made it the closest competitor to Chi-Chi's. The first Don Pablo's location appeared in Texas in the mid-'80s, and due to its success, it started growing from there — so much so that seven years after its conception, it was already gaining traction with 10 stores.\n\nPerhaps what Don Pablo's was well-known for was its use of quality ingredients in the form of tacos, burritos, fajitas, salads, and more. It didn't hurt that the prices were quite affordable, too, which made family dinners at Don Pablo's even more appealing. Other than the food, the exceptional dining experience left an indelible mark, stirring up memories whenever you hear its name. You might remember your excitement from watching how tortillas were made, celebrating your seventh birthday, and seeing how the interiors were grand and a bit theatrical — which the chain allegedly even hired decorators for. Its stores saw frequent revamps, which made it stand out from its sea of competitors. Everything seemed to be looking up for this now-defunct Mexican chain. So where did it all take a turn?\n\nThe previously glorious Mexican chain was doing really well in the '90s, but by the early 2000s, things started to fall apart. It went through different owners before it completely shut down. Avado Brands, which bought Don Pablo's from DF&R Restaurants in 1995, eventually filed for bankruptcy in 2004. But it seemed that most of Don Pablo's locations remained open. In 2007, Avado Brands filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy once again, which prompted the management to sell its holdings at an auction. It was already losing a lot of its stores in the process, and eventually, Rita Restaurant Corporation bought Don Pablo's at the 2008 auction. You would think that after the repeated setbacks, Don Pablo's would finally turn things around. But it became evident how the restaurant chain continued to struggle financially. In 2016, Rita Restaurant Corporation also filed for bankruptcy, eventually leading a lot of restaurants to cease operations until the last one in Deptford, N.J. closed in 2019.\n\nRita Restaurant Group pointed to the competitive Mexican restaurant scene, as well as the challenges in casual dining operations. To make things worse, it was during this time when chains like Chipotle began pioneering the fast casual chain boom, causing further decline for Don Pablo's. Perhaps other than quality food and impressive interiors, the chain never discovered its niche enough to make it stand out. Now, Don Pablo's is but a fleeting memory, and we can only reminisce about the once-familiar name that brought many of us a lot of good times.\n\nWant more food knowledge?

    "description": "Antoine Wade said everyone has the same amount of time in a day to learn about AI tools, and in this moment, everyone is competing.",
    "fullText": "Antoine Wade, a tech sales employee, uses AI daily for personal and professional tasks.\n\nHe said AI has helped him grow his pipeline by letting him communicate more effectively and understand customers better.\n\nHe said he keeps some of his AI strategies private to maintain a competitive advantage in sales.\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Antoine Wade, a tech sales employee who is based in San Antonio. His identity and employment have been verified by Business Insider. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI started to use AI around 2022 when ChatGPT first launched. It was unlike any technology that I've come across and I started to leverage it in my personal and professional life.\n\nInitially, it helped me craft emails. I work in tech sales and I have to do a lot of cold outreaches. My job is to write messages that resonate with various leaders and ChatGPT helped me with that.\n\nOnce I started using it at work, I realized that as a sports coach and father, there was so much more I could use it for, like sending post-practice communication to parents, building schedules, or putting together statistics of how the game went. Tasks that used to take me days took me literal minutes.\n\nNow I use AI everyday, and I've experimented with different tools. I use Claude to help with business communication and content generation. I use Perplexity for deep research, and Gemini for image generation. I use these tools for a combination of personal, professional, and educational use-cases. I've learned how to install an air conditioner and how to teach my son 6th grade math.\n\nMy company has also given me access to tools that have been really powerful in sales. It can help with gaining a better understanding of the customer in a minute's notice.\n\nFor example, tools like Salesforce Sales Navigator can pinpoint almost the exact person that may be looking for the product I'm selling. Now when I reach out to that person, the conversation will be more fruitful than it would if it were a completely random cold call.\n\nAI hasn't helped me close deals — I'm the one that's built those relationships with customers — but I've seen an increase in my pipeline because I'm able to reach more clients with the data and messaging.\n\nWhen I'm able to understand the customer better, I'm able to communicate more effectively, which leads to building a better pipeline, which ultimately leads to making more money.\n\nWhile people may have access to the same tools, it's still up to the user to put the data together and craft the right prompts. I've been experimenting with so many automation tools that I've developed a secret sauce.\n\nIf I'm creating prompts that give me a better message, which leads to a better outcome, I may not share it with others because I want to see if it works and if it's going to give me a competitive advantage.\n\nWe all have the same amount of time in a day to learn these things. So if I'm putting more time toward learning more about prompt engineering or how AI is supposed to work, then I don't necessarily want to share those learnings with someone else. In this moment, we're all competing.\n\nI will absolutely help someone if they ask, but there are certain details I'm not as forthcoming about. I may share some of those learnings with some of my closest friends or people I feel I can learn from, but that doesn't mean I'm sharing it with everybody.\n\nSales is very competitive and while companies are choosing to have conversations around AI, some people may not be as comfortable sharing how they're leveraging it because that may be their competitive advantage.\n\nWhen people ask if I use AI, I say \"absolutely, yes.\" But there's only a certain amount of people that I'm going into a deeper conversations about AI with.",

    "title": "Wild-Caught Or Farm-Raised Fish: Does It Make A Difference Which One You Buy?",
    "description": "All the fish you find at your supermarket were either wild-caught or farm-raised, and there are differences in the final product. Here's what you should know.",
    "fullText": "If you're buying fish, the choices can be daunting — and not just because of the many different varieties available or the difficulties of figuring out how to choose the freshest fish. Another question to ask yourself is should you buy farm-raised or wild-caught? There are pros and cons to both, so how do you choose? To help make your decision, we've reviewed the many aspects you need to take into consideration when deciding between the two.\n\nFarm-raised fish, meaning fish that is raised in a controlled environment, are a product of a practice known as aquaculture. They can be a perfectly good choice, as long as you know what you are looking for when you shop. In fact, more than 50% of the world's seafood supply is farm-raised. Wild-caught fish are harvested from open bodies of water, such as seas, lakes, or rivers, where the fish live in their natural habitat and survive and reproduce without the assistance of humans. In some ways, it is difficult to replicate the quality of fish that live in the wild, but there are still plenty of reasons to favor fish raised in hatcheries. Aside from these broader differences, your choice between the two comes down to nutritional value, flavor, price, and sustainability.\n\nThe nutritional value of fish is not a secret. Fish is packed with vitamins and nutrients, but the environment a fish lives in has an impact on its nutritional value. Wild-caught fish have a more active lifestyle (with limitless room to roam) and enjoy a natural, healthy diet, which makes them highly nutritious. That means high-quality proteins containing essential amino acids that are easily absorbed by your body, and you don't have to worry about the fish containing antibiotics.\n\nFarm-raised fish eat a carefully controlled diet that is designed to boost the omega-3 fatty acids in the fish so that it is comparable with that of wild-caught fish. Farm-raised salmon, for instance, has the same amount of protein (22 grams) as wild-caught salmon, but actually has slightly higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids (2.1 grams compared to 2 grams). The downside, however, is that the fat content and calories of farm-raised salmon tend to be slightly higher than their wild counterparts, partly as a result of the limited exercise they get.\n\nWhile some differences between wild and farm-raised fish, such as nutritional value, might be negligible, one determining factor in your decision should be flavor. Wild-caught fish has a reputation for having stronger flavor and firmer texture as a result of its varied diet and highly active lifestyle.\n\nFarm-raised fish, on the other hand, receive carefully controlled diets that may guarantee their nutritional value, but lack the variety of what fish would eat in the wild. As a result, they tend to have a milder flavor that is often considered buttery as a result of the higher fat content these fish are known for. If you want to serve fish that has the same reliable flavor every time, however, farm-raised fish might be a better choice since the diets farmed fish are given don't vary much.\n\nSustainability is a deciding factor for a lot of fish lovers. With popular grocery chains stocking their shelves with sustainably sourced fish, it's getting easier and easier to buy seafood responsibly. When it comes to sustainable seafood, we're talking about seafood caught or produced in ways that promote the long-term well-being of the species, as well as reducing any harmful effects on the environment and promoting a sustainable lifestyle for those who work in the industry. However, there is still a debate about whether one type of fish is more sustainable than the other.\n\nHarvesting fish from the wild can be sustainable, depending on the practices used by the fishermen. Florida's delicious stone crabs are an excellent example of sustainably harvested fishing that doesn't utilize fish hatcheries. By following local regulations, including catch limits and only fishing for certain species at certain times, fisherman can ensure that a species isn't over-fished to extinction. The problem is proving these practices are being followed is difficult, especially for the consumer. Farming fish solves the problem of overfishing by design. Farming directly manages species populations and ensures a continual replenishment of supplies, letting natural supplies flourish on their own in the process.\n\nWhen it comes to sustainability, the protection of marine species isn't the only issue. There is also a significant impact on the environment to be considered. With wild fishing, there are not only the carbon emissions from commercial fishing vessels to be concerned about, but also the waste generated and the harm to the marine ecosystem and other marine life caused by fishing gear, such as torn or lost fishing nets or traps. In contrast, aquafarms require a lot of resources to build and operate, creating carbon emissions in the process. In recent years, however, there have been advancements in technologies that help create more efficient aquaculture practices that result in lower CO2 emissions.\n\nWhen it comes to sustainability and environmental impact, the key is to shop responsibly. There are some certifications that you can look for, but they are not universal or consistent, and difficult for authorities to regulate and monitor. A great way to do your due diligence is to ask your retailer, who can tell you if the fish was sustainably sourced and where it was sourced from. You can also check with sources such as NOAA Fish Watch, a government organization that helps monitor species known for being overfished and involved in environmental concerns related to their harvesting.\n\nWild-caught fish is often favored by consumers, but it also tends to come at a higher price. There is an obvious difference between the amount of work involved in the two practices, with wild fish supplies being unpredictable. Food supplies can impact the swimming patterns of fish, making them potentially difficult for fishermen to find, which can make the supply scarce. Weather is another uncontrollable factor that can prevent fishermen from catching the amount of fish they are searching for. This random availability affects the supply and demand process that drives retail prices.\n\nAquafarms, however, are not susceptible to these forces of nature and are better able to control production cost. They also control and replenish their own supply, therefore reducing the problem of supply shortages. In turn, aquafarms can offer consistent supplies at steady prices, which prevents the supply and demand issue from causing fluctuations in price.\n\nFarming fish and catching it in the wild both have their benefits, as well as their drawbacks, that affect both the ecosystem and the consumer. Ultimately, shopping responsibly and knowing what you are buying (and why) helps you make the decision that is best for you.\n\nWant more food knowledge?

With 3:36 left in the game, the score was tied at 117 after Poole and Brunson had exchanged 3s.\n\nBrunson rebounded his own missed 3 and hit a running floater just inside the baseline to give New York a 124-121 lead with 1:06 to go.\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 39 points and Oklahoma City used a big third quarter to beat skidding Atlanta.\n\nChet Holmgren had 24 points, nine rebounds and three blocks, and Jalen Williams added 20 points, nine rebounds and seven assists for the NBA-leading Thunder (28-5).\n\nGilgeous-Alexander scored the Thunder’s first eight points.

    "description": "Nathan MacKinnon and Brock Nelson spearheaded Colorado’s offensive onslaught, combining for four points as the Avalanche extended their winning streak to eight games with a disciplined 5–2 victory over the Los Angeles Kings.",
    "fullText": "DENVER —  Nathan MacKinnon and Brock Nelson each recorded a goal and an assist as the Colorado Avalanche extended their winning streak to eight games with a 5–2 victory over the Los Angeles Kings at Ball Arena on Monday night.\n\nJack Drury, Martin Nečas, and Cale Makar also found the back of the net for Colorado (29-2-7), which has now won 14 straight games on home ice and is 10-0-1 over its last 11 contests. Mackenzie Blackwood stopped 23 shots in the win, making several timely, highlight-reel saves to help seal the victory.\n\nCorey Perry and Joel Armia scored for Los Angeles (16-13-9), while Anton Forsberg made 21 saves. The Kings have dropped seven of their last nine games and have lost five of their last six meetings with the Avalanche.\n\nBrent Burns turned the puck over at center ice early, allowing Alex Turcotte to break in alone, but Blackwood stood tall and turned aside the chance.\n\nJust over nine minutes into the period, Colorado had managed only one shot on goal, though its defense was doing its part. Josh Manson set a physical tone by knocking Quinton Byfield off the puck during one sequence.\n\nAt the 9:24 mark, the Avalanche doubled their shot total in emphatic fashion. Drury fired a shot that deflected off Darcy Kuemper’s blocker and into the net to give Colorado a 1–0 lead. The play developed after Ross Colton intercepted a pass, surveyed the ice, and found Drury streaking down the middle for the finish.\n\nWith nearly four minutes remaining, Colorado went to the power play after Andrei Kuzmenko was whistled for interference following a collision with Gavin Brindley off the draw. The man advantage came up empty, and the teams returned to even strength.\n\nAfter one period, the Avalanche held a 1–0 lead despite Los Angeles owning a 10–8 edge in shots.\n\nParker Kelly was penalized for holding early in the frame, and with just four seconds left on the kill, Colorado surrendered the equalizer when Perry deflected a pass from Kevin Fiala past Blackwood to tie the game.\n\nA few minutes later, Brian Dumoulin was sent off for interference on Drury. Dumoulin vehemently disagreed with the call and argued with the officials before heading to the box. After Colorado failed to convert on its second power play, Colton was assessed an interference penalty.\n\nNečas restored the lead with 6:39 remaining on a scramble in front. Gabe Landeskog and MacKinnon each took swings at a loose puck, and after Forsberg failed to smother it, the rebound trickled free to Nečas at the doorstep for an easy tap-in.\n\nLos Angeles was penalized again when Brandt Clarke cross-checked Artturi Lehkonen in the back. The power play struggled once more, and Kempe nearly made Colorado pay with a shorthanded breakaway, but Blackwood came up with a massive save.\n\nNelson made it 3–1 with 2:30 left in the period, ripping a wrist shot over Forsberg’s glove after taking a perfectly placed saucer feed from Kiviranta.\n\nNearly four minutes into the final frame, Clarke was sent to the box again—this time for tripping Kiviranta and sending him crashing into the boards.\n\nThe Kings, however, refused to fold. Armia struck shorthanded to pull Los Angeles within a goal, skating the length of the ice before toe-dragging around Cale Makar to give himself additional real estate and time before snapping a wrist shot from the high slot that slipped through Blackwood five-hole.\n\nAs the clock approached the midway point of the period, Drury was whistled for hooking on what appeared to be a questionable call, but the penalty kill stood firm and snuffed out the threat.\n\nMacKinnon only had two shots on net, and the final one was a goal as he shot the puck into an empty net at 18:23 to make it 4-2, and Makar scored on a rebound with 45 seconds left to complete the 5-2 victory.\n\nAs the Avalanche have shown all season, they have exhibited grit and the ability to suffocate their opposition in the championship rounds.\n\nThe Avalanche will square off against the struggling St. Louis Blues on New Year’s Eve to close out 2025. Coverage begins at 7 p.m., with a fireworks show scheduled to follow the game.\n\nFor action-packed issues, access to the entire magazine archive and a free issue, com/free.

    "fullText": "ATLANTA (AP) — Matthew Stafford reached a career milestone, though his three interceptions hurt the Rams' chances of winning a game and perhaps his own of winning the NFL's MVP.\n\nStafford set a career high in touchdown passes in a season with 42 when he hit Puka Nakua for an 11-yard score with 2:46 to play, but the Falcons answered with a 51-yard field goal with 21 seconds left and upset the Rams 27-24 on Monday night.\n\nStafford was 22 for 38 for 269 yards with two touchdowns and a season-high three interceptions, one of which was returned for a touchdown. It was the quarterback's first three-interception game since Week 1 of the 2022 season.\n\n“He’s a total stud,” Rams coach Sean McVay said. “We wouldn’t be in a lot of the great situations we’re in without him. But tonight was, it was a night that he’s capable of playing better.”\n\nStafford helped rally the Rams from a 24-3 second-half deficit to tie the score at 24 on his scoring toss to Nakua. His first touchdown was a 27-yard pass to Terrence Ferguson in the third quarter that pulled the Rams within 24-10.\n\nStafford was also sacked three times, which matched a season high, but didn't feel like the Falcons' pressure was overwhelming.\n\n“Every week is a new challenge,\" Stafford said. \"Just because you play good one week doesn’t mean you’re going to play good the next, and vice versa. So just got to go out there and continue to trust what we’ve done all year, and then we got to just show up and make the plays on game day.”\n\nStafford’s previous high for touchdowns in a season was 41, which he accomplished twice. He had 41 in 2011 with the Lions and in 2021 with the Rams.\n\nStafford was the betting favorite to win the first MVP award of his 17-year career ahead of Patriots second-year quarterback Drake Maye. On Sunday, Maye had a near-perfect afternoon against the Jets, presumably closing the gap on Stafford. Maye was 19 for 21 for 256 yards and five touchdowns in New York as the Patriots rolled to a 42-10 win. He played the first six possessions of the game and led the Patriots to six touchdowns.\n\nStafford is averaging 278 passing yards per game to Maye's 262.7, has 42 passing TDs to Maye's 30 and the quarterbacks are even with eight interceptions apiece. Maye's big day against the Jets pulled him virtually even with Stafford in passer rating prior to the Falcons game. Maye also has 409 rushing yards and four rushing touchdowns while Stafford has -2 rushing yards and no rushing touchdowns on the season. Maye's completion percentage, which leads the NFL, is 71.7 to Stafford's 65.2 (18th).\n\nThe Patriots clinched the AFC East on Sunday and enter Week 18 with a 13-3 record, while Stafford's Rams are 11-5 and will enter the playoffs as a wild card. The Patriots will close the regular season at home against the Dolphins and still have a shot at the No. 1 seed in the AFC, so Maye figures to play. Los Angeles will host the Arizona Cardinals and McVay said Monday his starters will play.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "description": "For long stretches of Monday nights game in Ball Arena, the Kings went toe-to-toe against the best team in the NHL, then Colorado exposed Los Angeles' mistakes that ultimately doomed them to a 5-2 loss.",
    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Kings (16-13-9) delivered a competitive, physical performance against the NHL's elite team. Still, costly turnovers and late-game execution issues proved decisive in their 5-2 loss to the Colorado Avalanche (29-2-7) on Monday night.\n\nDespite the Kings keeping pace for much of the game and generating consistent man-to-man pressure that was giving the Avs trouble early on, LA was unable to match Colorado's finishing touches, especially in the final minutes of regulation.\n\nFinal from Denver. #GoKingsGo pic.twitter.com/A29PaP048W\n\n— LA Kings (@LAKings) December 30, 2025\n\nThe first period played like a playoff atmosphere in the Mile High City, with both teams finishing checks and pushing the pace from the opening whistle. The Kings showed up early with their physicality, throwing hits from Adrian Kempe, Warren Foegele, and Alex Laferriere while generating quality looks.\n\nHowever, Colorado struck first. Center Ross Colton forced a turnover on the forecheck and fed Jack Drury in the slot, who beat goaltender Anton Forsberg for a 1-0 Avalanche lead.\n\nLos Angeles continued to put pressure on the Avs, but Mackenzie Blackwood was sharp under the net, turning aside multiple Kings chances to break Colorado's lead.\n\nThe Kings tied the game midway through the second period thanks to Corey Perry's veteran play this season. Perry found soft ice near the crease and finished off a Kevin Fiala feed, beating Blackwood to knot the game at 1-1.\n\nDespite the Kings' goal, the Avs never let them stay comfortable, and the momentum didn't last long.\n\nColorado responded with relentless pressure. Forward Martin Necas restored the Avs' lead after a dominant shift that should've been a penalty on the Kings, but Necas still sustained the puck to score in traffic around the net.\n\nLater in the period, center Brock Nelson made it 3-1 after another Kings turnover, giving Colorado breathing room heading into the third.\n\nLos Angeles made one final push in the third. Armia delivered a highlight of the night with a dazzling shorthanded goal, now leading the NHL with four shorthanded goals. But Colorado closed the door on the Kings' inability to convert when they had so many chances to tie the game.\n\nThe Avalanche scored two goals in the final minute of regulation, with an empty-netter coming seconds later to seal the victory 5-2.\n\nThe Kings finished shots to Colorado's 26 and won 50 percent of its faceoffs, but 18 giveaways, several of them led to the Avs directly scoring and giving them several chances, which proved to be costly for Los Angeles.\n\nWhile Los Angeles proved today that it can skate and compete physically with Colorado, the Avalanche still exposed the Kings' mistakes that have been punishing them all season.\n\nFor action-packed issues, access to the entire magazine archive and a free issue, com/free.

He was quickly ruled out for the rest of the game.\n\nJokic was having a stellar game prior to the injury. He had 21 points, five rebounds and eight assists in 19 first half minutes.\n\nHeat center Bam Adebayo complimented Jokic after the win.\n\n\"It's always fun playing against him,\" Adebayo said. \"You see how he makes his teammates better, you see the greatness.\"\n\nAdebayo had 13 points on 5/10 shooting, along with 10 rebounds and four assists. He said Jokic respects the integrity of the game and plays the right way.\n\n\"He's one of those guys that doesn't really flop, and I truly respect that,\" he said.\n\nMore NBA: Wild proposed trade has Heat landing 3 future Hall of Famers\n\nJokic, a 3-time MVP, is a top contender for the award again this season. He's averaging 29.9 points, 12.4 rebounds and 11.1 assists.

    "fullText": "Mike Brown believes the New York Knicks have 'The Guy' to compete for a championship originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New York Knicks are considered by the majority of the NBA as the favorite to win the Eastern Conference. Before the season even started, the expectations were high for the Knicks, considering the Indiana Pacers lost their superstar guard, Tyrese Haliburton.\n\nNow, the Knicks are not the number one seed, but they have the strongest chance of succeeding in the postseason. They also have a superstar who can carry them to victory in Jalen Brunson. With that kind of star power, it is hard to count out the Knicks in any game they play.\n\nDuring the Knicks' game against the New Orleans Pelicans, Jalen Brunson once again showcased his star power with 28 points and 10 assists. It was yet another superb performance by the Knicks, which is their third win in a row.\n\nWith that victory, they are only one game behind the Detroit Pistons, who are at the top of the Eastern Conference. The Pistons have lost two games in a row, which could mean the Knicks can keep fighting for the number one seed in the East.\n\nMore: Josh Hart's message fueled Knicks' historic Christmas comeback\n\nKnicks head coach Mike Brown always loves to hype up his players, including Brunson. He thinks that Brunson is good enough to be called one of the special players who can propel a team to a championship.\n\n\"You gotta have a guy. We're talking about a league MVP, and we have a guy. he definitely makes the game easier for everybody, for sure,\" Brown said after the game against the Pelicans.\n\nMoving forward, the Knicks will continue to fight in the upper echelon of the Eastern Conference. They are playing under heavy pressure because of their status as preseason favorites. The Cleveland Cavaliers have crumbled under that pressure this season, as the Knicks will hope to live up to the hype.\n\nWith how they have succeeded this season, including the NBA Cup victory, the Knicks can keep living up to expectations. It will be challenging, but Brown, Brunson, and the rest of the Knicks will do their best.\n\nMikal Bridges injury update: Latest news on Knicks guard's status vs. Pelicans\n\nKnicks star Is on pace to Join NBA’s elite crucial offensive stat\n\nNBA legend blasts Knicks decision not to hang NBA Cup banner: 'Celebrate the win'\n\nKnicks former NBA Draft pick gets granted four years of college eligibility\n\nSix New York Knicks featured in The Ringer's new Top 100",

    "fullText": "Something has to might come to an end on Tuesday (2:30 pm ET) — Chelsea's run of just one win in six Premier League games, or Bournemouth's nine-game winless slide — when the two sides meet at Stamford Bridge to close out 2025.\n\nJust as they did last season, Chelsea (5th place - 29 points) entered into the PL title race for all of a handful of days before falling into a downward spiral that ended their chase just as quickly as it began. The Blues sat 2nd in the table after 12 games, six points off leaders Arsenal. Six games (and just one win) later, and the gap is 13. Saturday’s 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa was a heavy blow for Enzo Maresca's side, after they flat out dominated the game in the first half (10-0 shots, 1.97-0.00 xG) before a shocking role reversal after the break.\n\nIf confidence is low for the hosts, where must it be for Andoni Iraola's side? Speaking of sides that went 2nd in the table before the wheels fell off, Bournemouth (15th - 22 points) were four points back of Arsenal after nine games but after taking just four points from the next nine, they are now 20 points adrift and seem set to lose star attacker Antoine Semenyo during the January transfer window. Semenyo has a release clause in his contract that expires early in the month and Manchester City are keen to wrap up the deal quickly.\n\nFor live updates and highlights throughout Chelsea vs Bournemouth, check out PST's live blog coverage below.\n\nKick off time: 2:30 pm ET, Tuesday\nVenue: Stamford Bridge\nTV Channel: USA\nStreaming: Stream live on NBC.com\n\nOUT: Romeo Lavia (thigh), Dario Essugo (thigh), Levi Colwill (torn ACL - MORE), Mykhailo Mudryk (suspension) | QUESTIONABLE: Marc Cucurella (thigh), Jorrel Hato (undisclosed)\n\nOUT: Tyler Adams (knee - MORE), Veljko Milosavljevic (knee), Ben Gannon-Doak (hamstring), Matai Akinmboni (muscular) | QUESTIONABLE: Antoine Semenyo (undisclosed), Alex Scott (jaw)\n\nExactly what Chelsea need — a comfortable win thanks to their considerable attacking talent.

    "fullText": "It is actually BlueCo who are eyeing a former Manchester City midfielder rather than Chelsea, at least not yet anyway.\n\nStrasbourg is a known route to Chelsea for many players, being their sister club and under the same ownership group.\n\nSo when a player is linked to Strasbourg, you can often know that he is a potential future candidate to become a Chelsea player as well.\n\nAnd it looks like Chelsea’s recent links to James McAtee, would be more a signing for Strasbourg for now at least. I’d suspect Chelsea would view the former Manchester City man as a potential player for them in the near future, should he go and prove himself at their sister club.\n\nJames McAtee playing for Nottingham Forest. (Photo by Michael Regan/Getty Images)\n\nThe BBC report that BlueCo’s interest in Nottingham Forest midfielder James McAtee is for a loan move to Strasbourg rather than joining Chelsea.\n\nThis would make a bit more sense for now of course. But we know that McAtee is liked by Joe Shields and worked with him at City, and Shields is a Chelsea director. So I’d assume this is still being looked at as a possible future Chelsea move down the line at some point.\n\nReece James spoke to the club’s website after the game about how he and his teammates had failed to adapt to the changes made by Aston Villa midway through the game.\n\nJames also noted how well his team had done for large periods of the game – sadly games are not 65 minutes, and if you don’t score the goals your performance warrants you’ll always get punished.",

The Sun describes it as a \"horror crash\".\n\nThe Financial Times says the world's largest accounting body has decided to scrap remote exams because of a rise in students cheating when sitting tests online.\n\nThe Association of Chartered Certified Accountants says remote exams, which it introduced during the pandemic, have become too hard to police, partly because of cheating using AI.\n\nThere is plenty of reaction to the New Year Honours list in the papers, with the actor Idris Elba's knighthood making most of the headlines.\n\n\"Arise Sir Idris\", says the Daily Telegraph, the Daily Mirror and the Sun.\n\nMeanwhile, the front page of the i declares that England's Lionesses have \"dominated\" the honours after their Euros win in the summer.

    "fullText": "More than a year after his last Major League game, former Boston Red Sox pitcher Joe Kelly is calling it a career.\n\nKelly essentially announced his retirement on the “Baseball Isn’t Boring” podcast, saying he’s no longer pitching. True to form, he refused to explicitly say he’s retiring, taking exception to the phrase.\n\n“Retiring is, like, something my grandmother did,” Kelly said. “It’s so disrespectful. I’m sorry all you people out there that work a real job. You guys deserve to retire. Athletes don’t. We just stop (expletive) playing…No more retirement (expletive).”\n\nKelly last pitched in 2024 for the Los Angeles Dodgers, earning his third World Series ring. After going unsigned in 2025, the 37-year-old right-hander is hanging it up.\n\nHis eventful MLB career spanned 13 seasons from 2012 to 2024. He pitched for four teams and won three championships along the way, primarily as a reliever.\n\nAfter beginning his career with the St. Louis Cardinals, Kelly spent four and a half seasons with the Red Sox from 2014 to 2018. He initially struggled as a starter but had more success after moving to the bullpen, leading the 2018 World Series champs with 73 relief appearances.\n\nKelly flourished during that playoff run, allowing just one earned run with 13 strikeouts over 11 1/3 postseason innings. He always saved his best for October, posting a 0.51 ERA in the playoffs with Boston.\n\nHe joined the Dodgers after pitching against them in the 2018 Fall Classic, helping them win titles in 2020 and 2024.\n\nTalkative, combative and armed with a good fastball, Kelly had a reputation for getting under opponents’ skin and occasionally starting brawls. He was a character who stood out from the crowd with his unique personality and presence, making him one of the more memorable relievers in recent Red Sox history.\n\nRed Sox Should Sign Veteran Southpaw After Short Stint With Cubs",

    "fullText": "The Calgary Flames leaned on patience, goaltending, and timely execution to earn a 2–1 overtime win against the Boston Bruins on Monday night at the Scotiabank Saddledome.\n\nThe opening period lacked pace until Boston earned a power play midway through the frame. Flames goaltender Dustin Wolf was sharp early, making a pair of key saves to keep the game scoreless. Late in the period, Bruins defenceman Andrew Peeke drove toward the net and made contact with Wolf after losing the puck, as it slipped through Wolf and into the net. Calgary challenged for goaltender interference, but the goal stood, giving Boston a 1–0 lead at the 18:06 mark and putting the Flames shorthanded to close the period.\n\nThe second period remained tight-checking and low-event until Calgary finally broke through. At 13:33, sustained pressure in the offensive zone paid off as Mikael Backlund found Blake Coleman in the slot. Coleman snapped a quick shot through Bruins netminder Jeremy Swayman to tie the game 1–1, marking his team-leading 12th goal of the season.\n\nThe third period stayed scoreless despite Boston holding an 8–1 edge in shots. As regulation expired, Bruins defenceman Jonathan Aspirot was assessed a high-sticking penalty, sending the Flames to overtime with a carryover power play.\n\nCalgary nearly saw the advantage backfire when Pavel Zacha sprung loose for a shorthanded breakaway early in overtime. Wolf came up with a clutch stop and turned aside the rebound attempt from Nikita Zadorov. Moments later, the Flames capitalized. Yegor Sharangovich fired a shot through traffic, and Connor Zary got a piece of the rebound in front, as the puck found its way past Swayman to secure the 2–1 overtime victory.\n\n1. Blake Coleman continues to set the tone\n\nColeman delivered exactly what the Flames needed — offence, physical play, and composure in big moments. His second-period goal provided the spark, he finished checks throughout the night, and he drew the penalty that set up the overtime winner. His consistency has made him one of Calgary’s most reliable drivers this season.\n\n2. Dustin Wolf was calm and composed\n\nWolf turned aside 24 shots, including two high-danger chances in overtime, earning his 50th win of the season. He remained poised under pressure, tracked pucks well through traffic, and made the saves Calgary needed when momentum tilted Boston’s way.\n\n3. The power play found a way when it mattered most\n\nCalgary went 0-for-4 with the man advantage in regulation, struggling to generate rhythm. But the unit stayed patient, and the carryover power play in overtime finally delivered, proving decisive in a tightly contested game.\n\n“They play a pretty similar game to us and you’ve got to earn your ice and your space. Felt like one of those games that one goal was going to be the difference late in the game and, not pretty, but we got the job done.”\n\nWolf on the overtime breakaway saves:\n\n“Saw the first one, got snowed on the second one, so thankfully (the puck) hit me.”\n\n“At the end of day I think we just know (Wolf’s) got our back and he’s going to make big saves all the time and keep us in games… whether they’re on a 2-on-1 or have a breakaway you have confidence that Wolf is just going to make the save.”",

Moore has only started one full season in college, which means he could decide to return to school next season to get more game action before heading to the NFL.\n\nPatriots’ Rival Listed As Best Trade Landing Spot For Maxx Crosby Next Season",

He is a career .241 hitter during four major league seasons with four teams, but excels as a baserunner and a defender.\n\nThe Dodgers acquired Ruiz from the A’s last April, and he was a little-used reserve when he was in the majors for the back-to-back World Series champions. Ruiz batted .190 in 19 games for Los Angeles, largely playing as a defensive replacement or a pinch runner.\n\nThe Marlins designated infielder Eric Wagaman for assignment to make room on their 40-man roster for Ruiz. The trade opened a spot on the Dodgers’ 40-man roster.\n\nAs a capable backup outfielder, Ruiz could be the Marlins’ replacement for Dane Myers, who was traded to Cincinnati last weekend.",

    "fullText": "When it was announced that RC Strasbourg Alsace would be losing their star forward from last season, Emanuel Emegha, to Chelsea at the end of the 2025/26 season, few would have predicted that by winter, he would have lost his spot to Joaquin Panichelli, a 23-year-old Argentinian who had spent the previous season playing in the Spanish second tier.\n\nJoaquin came through the youth academy at Argentina’s Racing Club, in his hometown of Córdoba. By 2020, he was on the books at the academy of River Plate, Argentina’s most successful team, boasting over 50 domestic titles and 18 international accolades in their illustrious history. He never actually made his debut for the senior team, before attracting attention from Europe.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of many of Argentina’s greatest forwards, he made the step to Spain; Deportivo Alaves acquired his services in January 2023 for a reported fee in the region of €3m, a not-insignificant fee for an unproven 19-year-old with no senior experience for a Spanish side fighting for promotion from La Liga 2. He made two appearances in the second half of the European season, as Alaves gained promotion back to La Liga. In his first full season with Alaves, he struggled to for game time and did not light up the show on the few chances he was given. Panichelli went goalless in eight appearances (six off the bench) which led Alaves to consider their options for the young South American.\n\nThe decision was taken to send the striker out on loan to CD Mirandes, who are known for their youth development, especially developing young players who come in on loan. This is where Panichelli finally got his first taste of regular football at senior level, and he really took his opportunity in showing the world his talent. Mirandes cruelly missed out on promotion to La Liga in the playoff final, after Panichelli had scored 20 goals and assisted four times to get them there.\n\nHis performances for Mirandes naturally attracted attention from many top clubs in Spain and beyond, and with Alaves looking to cash in, it was Strasbourg, fresh off the back of qualifying for the UEFA Europa Conference League group stage who secured his signature for a fee in the region of €17m.\n\nStrasbourg were Ligue 1’s biggest spenders this summer with a whopping €111.5m spent bring in a number of players, of which Panichelli was the most expensive. The 22-year-old Argentinian certainly had stiff competition for a starting place, going up against club captain ‘Ema’ Emegha who had propelled the Alsatian club into the Europa Conference League with 14 goals and three assists in the league the season prior.\n\nSince joining, though, Panichelli has improved even further. So far, he has racked up nine goals in his 16 games played and is second in the Ligue 1 golden boot race only to Marseille’s Mason Greenwood. The Strasbourg No.9 really asserted his position as the future of Liam Rosenior’s attack in a 5-0 home win against SCO Angers in October, when, but for an impressive display of shot-stopping from Angers’ goalkeeper Hervé Koffi, Joaquin could have had four or five goals by himself. He did net two goals in that game, as the injured Emegha watched on from the stands, just a month after announcing that he would be leaving to join BlueCo’s other club, Chelsea, for a fee of €25m next summer.\n\nWith Emegha’s recurring hamstring injury this season, Panichelli has had to step up to be Strasbourg’s starting striker through the middle, when he was probably only brought in over the summer to be a deputy, to come off the bench late on to offer something different to the six-foot-six Dutchman. Nevertheless, Panichelli has since given Rosenior a bit of a headache after performing so well this first half of the season.\n\nOn the pitch, Panichelli blends traditional “big man” No.9 traits with a modern twist; he is strong in the air and an effective target man who holds the ball up well under pressure but also has the quickness of feet and movement that one might associate more with a winger or inside forward. He can score with both his head and feet and shows great pressing qualities that we have come to expect from a Rosenior team since the Englishman joined the BlueCo project back in July 2024. Panichelli ranks in the top 3% of forwards in Europe’s top five leagues for interceptions and blocks per 90, and in the top 10% for tackles and clearances. The six-foot-four Argentine is a clinical finisher, combining extremely well with Strasbourg’s Ivorian right back Guela Doué, who has provided him with three assists already this season.\n\nThere remain areas for the young man to improve; despite his speed, he rarely uses his speed to dribble past defenders, ranking in the bottom 10% of strikers in Europe’s big five leagues for progressive carries and passes. He would not be described by many as a creator, but no one can deny that he is an excellent finisher, and with time could become world-class – the next in a long line of Argentinian attacking superstars.\n\nPanichelli’s contract at Strasbourg runs until 2030. For this reason, any club that may come calling in the next few years could be looking at paying a sizeable fee for his services, should his good form since arriving continue. For now, he needs to focus on maintaining his position in the national team setup, after making his debut off the bench in a friendly against Angola in the most recent international break. If called up, he should be one to watch during the upcoming World Cup in the USA, Canada and Mexico.\n\nHe could yet be the future of Argentina’s attack, and at least in the medium to short-term, he looks to be the future of RCSA’s strike force, too.",

    "title": "7 takeaways from Rams' frustrating loss to Falcons",
    "description": "The Rams played terribly against the Falcons and no longer look like the unbeatable NFC leaders they once were.",
    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Rams bounced back from their previous three losses by winning their next game. They failed to do that on Monday night, losing in fairly embarrassing fashion to the Atlanta Falcons, 27-24.\n\nThey allowed their loss to the Seattle Seahawks to snowball into a losing skid, having now dropped two in a row. Sean McVay is frustrated, Matthew Stafford had one of his worst games of the season and the defense just gave up 195 yards rushing to Bijan Robinson.\n\nThere aren't many positives to take away from this game and though the sky isn't falling, the Rams have plenty to correct before the playoffs begin.\n\nD.J. Humphries was a liability at left tackle all night long. He whiffed on a block on the Rams’ failed fourth-down run early in the game, got called for an illegal formation on Puka Nacua’s 36-yard catch, allowed a sack in the third quarter and was getting beat throughout the game.\n\nHis costliest play might’ve been in the fourth quarter when his holding penalty negated a game-tying 41-yard touchdown catch by Puka Nacua, though Nacua did get into the end zone a few plays later.\n\nJackson was questionable and Sean McVay thought he might be able to play so it doesn’t seem like a long-term injury, but the Rams need him healthy in the worst way. They can't go into the playoffs with Humphries at left tackle.\n\nHis coverage skills are obviously great, but Lake is especially missed as a run defender. He’s disciplined and takes good angles to ball carriers, which helps prevent big plays when running backs to get to the second and third level of the defense.\n\nBijan Robinson gashed the Rams for 195 yards on the ground Monday night and that’s not to say Lake would’ve completely changed the outcome, but his presence as the slot defender surely would’ve helped limit some of Robinson’s bigger runs.\n\nIt’s not that the secondary gave up huge plays to Kirk Cousins and the Falcons’ passing attack. The Rams only allowed 126 yards passing, 34 of which were with Robinson on the receiving end.\n\nIt’s that the coverage was never all that tight and the secondary couldn’t cover when the defense needed to get off the field. They didn’t force many difficult throws for Cousins, aside from the one pass Emmanuel Forbes Jr. broke up on the opening drive.\n\nThat was the Rams’ only pass defensed in the entire game.\n\nIt’s not a good sign that they keep rotating cornerbacks without finding their best trio, making Ahkello Witherspoon inactive the last two weeks and Darious Williams on Monday night. Come playoff time, the Rams need their corners to play better.\n\nThere’s a big difference between the Rams’ last two losses. Against the Seahawks, they simply melted down and collapsed in the fourth quarter. Against the Falcons, they simply did not play well. They mustered just 363 total yards on offense, went 5-for-13 on third down and turned it over three times.\n\nThere was a lot to like in the loss to Seattle, but it’s hard to find many positives from this game. As McVay said afterwards, the Rams “have to play better.” And that’s exactly why he plans to play his starters in the finale against the Cardinals.\n\nIf the Rams don’t clean things up on both sides of the ball, they’re not going very far in the playoffs. Getting Davante Adams, Kevin Dotson, Quentin Lake and Alaric Jackson back at some point will help but this isn’t how L.A. wanted to finish off what had been a great year up until the last two weeks.\n\nStafford’s disastrous first half set things in motion for Drake Maye to take over as the MVP frontrunner. Then Stafford threw another interception in the fourth quarter when the Rams were trying to tie the game.\n\nMVP is partly a team award so when you lose as a quarterback, it hurts your chances of winning votes. And not only did the Rams lose, but Stafford played terribly. It was arguably his worst game of the year, throwing three interceptions and missing a few open throws – including one that would’ve gotten the Rams in field goal range in the final seconds or possibly gone for a touchdown.\n\nMaye is now -550 to win NFL MVP as the heavy favorite and is unlikely to give it up in the final week against the Dolphins.\n\nFerguson only had two catches but both of them were big plays. His first was a 27-yard reception on a stutter-and-go down the left side, picking up chunks of yards when the Rams badly needed them. He then scored a 27-yard touchdown in the third quarter to make it 24-10, drawing the Rams a bit closer.\n\nHe only saw four targets on the night but his two receptions were both massive plays in the game to keep the momentum going. He’s going to be a special player for the Rams in 2026 after a full offseason of work, but his impact is already being felt as one of the team’s primary tight ends this year.\n\nIt only took one game for the Rams’ special teams unit to make a game-changing play after the firing of Chase Blackburn. For a unit that’s been a thorn in the Rams’ side all year, the special teams is actually what helped keep them in that game.\n\nJared Verse’s blocked field goal and return for a touchdown flipped the script, taking it from a possible 17-point game to only a seven-point deficit for the Rams. Ethan Evans hit a perfect punt that was downed at the 2 and Jordan Whittington had a nice 38-yard kickoff return.\n\nRoger McCreary did get called for a penalty on the Rams’ first punt return but for the most part, the special teams improved already.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Rams Wire: Rams vs. Falcons: 7 takeaways from LA's frustrating loss",

    "title": "Dennis Cirkin: From League One Prospect To Premier League Starter",
    "description": "“I hope that having sampled Premier League football for the first time, he’s hungry for more and determined to push on”.",
    "fullText": "As the years have passed and Sunderland’s squad has been revamped, refitted and reshaped, many of the architects of those memorable seasons and moments that preceded our return to the Premier League; of League One playoff success, the freewheeling “play it your way, lads” Tony Mowbray era and to an extent our landmark 2024/2025 season under Régis Le Bris have gradually moved on.\n\nFrom Corry Evans and Danny Batth to Ross Stewart and Bailey Wright; from Elliot Embleton and Patrick Roberts to Alex Pritchard and Jack Clarke, many if not all of the lads who played key roles under the likes of Alex Neil, Mowbray and Le Bris have left for pastures new.\n\nOf course, their legacies at Sunderland were secured in their own time but whether as a result of financial necessity, squad development or career progression, most of the players who created unforgettable moments at Hillsborough, the Hawthorns, the Madjeski Stadium and Wembley are long gone.\n\nHowever, one of them is still here and still proudly wearing the red and white stripes, and on Sunday, Dennis Cirkin finally earned the right to call himself a Premier League starter as he slotted in at left back for Sunderland’s clash with Leeds United.\n\nLike Luke O’Nien before him and after a Sunderland career that’s already encompassed League One playoff success and several promising campaigns in the Championship (including that goal against West Bromwich Albion), this felt like a landmark moment for the former Tottenham prospect — it was most definitely an opportunity earned and not given as a token gesture.\n\nFor me, as well as you’d expect for a player who’s battled back from long-term injury, has seen limited game time as a result and was therefore somewhat out of sync with Sunderland’s go-to system, the demands it places on our full backs and the frantic nature of Premier League football. In other words, he was fine.\n\nAgainst the visitors — who were good value for a point and showed the kind of purpose and determination that the likes of Newcastle United lacked — Cirkin showed flashes of energy and attacking intent but was also understandably rusty and was caught cold during the build up to Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s equaliser. That said, it certainly wasn’t a poor performance by any reasonable standard and I suspect he might’ve felt a quiet sense of satisfaction at how things went.\n\nWas this a surprise? Were we expecting miracles on his first top flight start? I think not, and it was to his credit that as a frenetic and occasionally scrappy game unfolded, Cirkin — much like Chris Rigg — didn’t shirk and didn’t hide.\n\nOnly the cynical, the bitter or the downright hard-hearted would begrudge Cirkin this opportunity.\n\nYes, his inclusion in Sunderland’s starting eleven against Daniel Farke’s men was borne of necessity, with first choice Reinildo and Arthur Masuaku both currently on AFCON duty, but at the same time, why would the club invest so much time and energy into Cirkin’s development if they didn’t believe he was capable of eventually making the step up?\n\nThe brilliant Mozambican is our first choice by some distance, but as the Christmas schedule takes its toll and players are brought in from the fringes, the onus is on the likes of Cirkin to show that they can play a role and offer Le Bris the kind of depth that he needs. With increased game time should come greater confidence and if he can get up to speed with the demands of top flight football, I can see him doing a sterling job until Reinildo returns from Morocco and is ready to go again.\n\nI’m unashamedly banging this particular drum for one simple reason: I like Cirkin as a footballer and I always have — not least because at his best in the Championship, he was one of the most dynamic and potent attack-minded full backs on the scene.\n\nFrom afar, he strikes me as something of a complex character; a player who perhaps has something of a difficult and fractious relationship with football, and it’s fair to say that he’s often endured torrid misfortune with injuries during his time at Sunderland.\n\nHowever, his ability is clear to see. He’s as deserving of a crack at top flight football as anyone and the fact that as of right now, he hasn’t put pen to paper on a new contract at Sunderland shouldn’t diminish his standing in the eyes of our fans.\n\nAs he seeks to prove that he can cut it at this level, what Le Bris and his coaching staff will almost certainly want to see from the likes of Cirkin is the kind of team-first attitude that’s propelled Sunderland along all season — and this was by no means a bad place to start.\n\nHe can play better and hopefully he will, and I hope that having sampled Premier League football for the first time, he’s hungry for more and determined to push on — starting against Manchester City later this week.",

    "fullText": "Girona head coach Michel has added fuel to growing speculation linking his side with a surprise winter move for Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen.\n\nReports in Spain have suggested that the Montilivi club are exploring the possibility of signing the German international on loan in January.\n\nGirona are reportedly keen to strengthen a position that has caused concern throughout the season.\n\nWhile no formal approach has been confirmed, Michel did little to quieten the rumours when asked about the situation at the Catalan Football Federation gala.\n\n“He is a top player. Everyone would like to have a player like that,” Michel said (via Gerard Romero), a remark that has only intensified talk of Girona’s interest.\n\nTer Stegen’s future at Barcelona has become increasingly uncertain after losing his place in the starting XI to Joan Garcia.\n\nThe 32-year-old remains one of Europe’s most decorated goalkeepers, but a lack of regular football could prove damaging to his hopes of reclaiming the No.1 shirt for Germany ahead of the 2026 World Cup.\n\nGirona’s interest is understood to be driven by their own goalkeeping issues.\n\nPaulo Gazzaniga has struggled for consistency, while Dominik Livakovic has yet to fully convince Michel or establish himself as a guaranteed starter.\n\nAs a result, the club are actively assessing options that could provide immediate stability and leadership at the back.\n\nHowever, financial constraints remain a major obstacle. Girona reportedly cannot cover Ter Stegen’s full wages for the remainder of the campaign.\n\nAny deal would require Barcelona to subsidise a significant portion of his salary.\n\nStill, Barca could be open to a compromise if Ter Stegen expresses a clear desire to move in search of more playing time.\n\nHe reportedly favours a switch that would restore him as an undisputed first choice, making Girona an attractive destination.\n\nWith the January window approaching, this story appears far from over.",

    "description": "The last game of 1893 was far from easy, yet the Lads were able to prevail…",
    "fullText": "The vagaries of the Christmas footballing calendar mean that 30 December seldom sees Sunderland matches hosted — and it must be said that victories for the Lads on this date are even rarer. However, the first instance in 1893 was worthwhile, as Tom Watson’s side welcomed Bolton Wanderers to their Newcastle Road ground and finished the year off with a resilient showing.\n\nAlthough the visitors were in the bottom half of the table and not in the best of form, they made better use of the blustery conditions and performed well, meaning that strong performances from Donald Gow and Hugh Wilson in the home rearguard were well timed.\n\nWilson’s selection in particular proved crucial as having recently come back into the side for Will Gibson, it meant the latter was able to step in and run the line — Bolton secretary John Bentley doing likewise on the opposite side of the pitch in order to assist the referee.\n\nWhen Sunderland took the lead after twenty minutes, it was slightly against the run of play although the finish was tidy, with John Harvey finding the target after Johnny Campbell played the ball to him when being closed down. There was a chance of a second shortly afterwards too, although after Jimmy Hannah had hit the crossbar, Bolton were able to muster another spell of pressure.\n\nIf anything, the Hannah incident had worked out well for the Trotters; goalkeeper John Sutcliffe damaged the goal frame whilst attempting to save the effort and in the ten minutes it took to get that sorted, his teammates had a conflab and regathered themselves.\n\nIt was decided also that in order to make up for lost time, the teams wouldn’t leave the field at half time and instead swapped ends before immediately resuming play — meaning there was little respite for Sunderland as they sought to maintain the advantage.\n\nJust as it was starting to look like a single goal would be enough for a Wearsiders’ win, George Ferguson levelled things up.\n\nThere was an element of shock about the equaliser for the shot — which some sources instead credited to Davie Weir. It initially appeared to be quite tame yet still managed to creep over the line and put the Lads back to square one. It was now their turn to try and regroup therefore but they did so magnificently, with James Gillespie capping off an exciting final few minutes when he chested the ball into the net from one of Wilson’s classic long throw-ins.\n\nAt the time Watson’s men were reigning league champions, having taken the title for the second season running. Their defence had stuttered somewhat up to now though, and it was only in the new year that they put together any sort of consistency — the points taken from this clash leaving them in mid-table at what was the beginnings of a much-improved league run of eleven victories in thirteen.\n\nNevertheless, it wasn’t enough to overhaul leaders Aston Villa and by the time of the final fixture — a return clash with the since beaten FA Cup finalists Bolton — the club had been forced to settle for a runners-up spot.\n\nSunderland 2 (Harvey 20’, Gillespie 89’)\n\nBolton Wanderers 1 (Ferguson 80’)\n\nSunderland: Doig, Meehan, Gow; Dunlop, Auld, Wilson; Gillespie, Harvey, Campbell; Millar, Hannah",

    "description": "Given we've only just played against Manchester City and are very aware of the threat they pose, how do you think we should set up against them to ensure we keep our unbeaten home run going at the Stadium of Light?",
    "fullText": "We saw in the first 20 minutes of the away fixture that we were able to frustrate Man City. It was only down to Dias’ thunderbastard of a strike that the direction of the game changed.\n\nAlthough we are at home, we are under no illusions as to how challenging this game will be. We’re missing key members of the team and are doing well so far to gain as many points as possible in challenging circumstances.\n\nI’d expect it to be as close to the Arsenal game as possible, but with the added challenge of personnel changes. Like others have said, I’d expect it to be five at the back with the team trying to soak up as much pressure as possible.\n\nWe do have some interesting questions to consider. Will Ballard be fit? I think this fixture will come too soon, so we can expect Mukiele and Alderete to be working on their partnership.\n\nWhat do we do about left- and right-back? Despite the excellent block on the line in the last game, we have seen teams target Hume in recent games. Alongside this, it’s only Cirkin’s second game at this level. However, there’s no substitute for experience in this league, so what better chance to prove himself than against the very best?\n\nRegardless, I’ll be fully in support of the 11 that Régis picks on the night. Regardless of who starts and who finishes, this team has shown how committed they are until the final whistle. Regardless of the result, we can rest assured that maximum effort will be evident throughout.\n\nThis is the ultimate dilemma. What will give? The at-times unstoppable force of the Man City attack, or the immovable object of our unbeaten home run?\n\nWe know that our home record is something to be proud of and to be protected, but if we sit back and are too deep and defensive then we will likely succumb to the pressure and quality of City eventually.\n\nWith the absences we have, I think we will likely go with a back five of three centre-backs (Alderete, Mukiele, and hopefully Ballard, but more likely Geertruida) with wing-backs.\n\nWe need an out, some sort of a route to counter, and with a back 3/5 we can use the wide men as extra defenders when we have to, but retain the ability to break when we get the chance.\n\nIt may be a five-at-the-back focus for significant periods of the game, but we have to do something to stay in the game and to challenge when options arise.\n\nWe may well dabble with a 5-4-1 when without the ball, given that the midfield battle will also be fundamental to the outcome. As Brobbey is strong in holding play up while support arrives, giving Xhaka extra help in the middle may well help us too.\n\nThe main question the coach has to sort out is who can best staff the wisest of the available formations (in his view).\n\nWith the Leeds performance in mind, Adingra has made a significant claim for a start against Man City, and Eli Mayenda also showed what he can do if we need a quick and physical wide man who can attack with intent.\n\nCan these lads play as wing-backs, or do we need to use Cirkin and Hume, which could be challenging against such an opponent (and was at times against Leeds)?\n\nThe one thing we have which will help us is Régis Le Bris. If anyone can get a tune out of our available lads against one of the main title challengers, it’s Reggie.\n\nHe may well go totally against what I’ve suggested and stick with a back four. He may go for it entirely. What he does often surprises me, and he will want to surprise Pep as much as he can too.\n\nWhat I am confident of is the gaffer will have learned from the loss at the Etihad, and he will get these lads to graft their arses off to protect our defensive record – and maybe do even more.\n\nIf we lose but give it our best shot, which is a risk with the absences we have and the class of this opponent, then we have to take that on the chin and keep building with the next one.\n\nWe earned the right to play these teams, so we need to give it our all and leave nothing in the tank.\n\nIf we lose our unbeaten home record to the champions-to-be, we won’t be the only ones who have succumbed this way.\n\nOur home record will still be very good if it has just one blemish on it. Let’s not forget that.\n\nBring it on; let’s show these guys what we can do.\n\nWithout doubt, it’s our biggest challenge of the season. We are missing the pace of the players who are at the AFCON, so City will not be as concerned with the speed of our counter-attacks as they may have been in the game a few weeks ago. Ballard will be a big miss, and we may well need to go to a back five with a holding midfielder in front of the three. The concern is that from what we have seen so far, City are the side we have played that can best break down the opposition. We took Arsenal on and in many ways had the better of it.\n\nWe cannot simply look to keep them out, and I think Brobbey may well be key as his ability to muscle the City defence and hold the ball up is likely to give us a significant out-ball if we are under pressure. The best form of defence is attack, but we will need to be drilled compact, keep our concentration, and be ruthless when chances come our way. A big test, but our home has been our fortress.",

    "fullText": "RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Carolina Hurricanes goalie Pyotr Kochetkov likely will miss the rest of the season after opting for surgery for a lingering lower-body injury.\n\nIt’s another blow for the Hurricanes, who held the best record in the Eastern Conference at 23-11-3 entering Monday night’s game against the New York Rangers.\n\n“It’s what he has been dealing with all year,” Carolina coach Rod Brind’Amour said. “He has decided to have surgery, so he’s going to be out for probably the year.”\n\nKochetkov is 6-2-0 this season with a 2.33 goals against average in nine outings. He has yet to undergo the surgery.\n\n“Didn’t feel right all year,” Brind’Amour said. “He has been playing great, so that’s the hard part. He has been kind of fighting through it. But he doesn’t want to continue that way, so we’ll get it fixed and go from there.”\n\nKochetkov, 26, had been slated to be in the net against the Rangers. He shut out New York with 26 saves Nov. 4 in New York.\n\nHis last outing, Dec. 20 at Tampa Bay, he allowed five goals on 28 shots to the Lightning.\n\nThe Hurricanes are likely to rely even more heavily on rookie goalie Brandon Bussi, who drew Monday night’s assignment. Veteran Frederik Andersen has been erratic in 15 games with a 5-8-2 record, with losses in his last seven appearances.\n\nIt has been a challenging opening 2½ months for the Hurricanes because of injuries. Seth Jarvis, who leads the team with 19 goals, sat out his fourth consecutive game Monday with an injury.\n\n“You lose arguably your best player offensively in that spot, so you’ve got to fill it,” Brind’Amour said.\n\nThe Hurricanes, who lead the Metropolitan Division, claimed forward Noah Philp off waivers from the Edmonton Oilers. He wasn’t available to play Monday.\n\nCarolina played without Shayne Gostisbehere, whose 29 points are more than twice any other defenseman on the team. He had three points Saturday night, but was scratched with an ailment.\n\nDefenseman K’Andre Miller moved back into the lineup to face his former team. Defenseman Gavin Bayreuther, who was recalled earlier in the day from Chicago of the AHL, was scratched.\n\nBrind’Amour said the Hurricanes had a couple of seasons without long injury lists. Now, he regularly juggles lineups.\n\n“This is kind of unprecedented,” he said. “Every team has a certain degree of it. … You got to figure it out.”\n\nThe Hurricanes had season-worst three-game losing streak before winning Saturday against the Atlantic Division-leading Detroit Red Wings.\n\n“It’s a testament to the guys who are playing every night,” Brind’Amour said.",

    "description": "As bad as you think it might have been, it was worse.",
    "fullText": "The Arizona Cardinals had a bad offensive performance on Sunday in their 37-14 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals. It was their worst offensive performance of the season.\n\nThey scored a season-low 14 points and gained a season-low 233 yards. Do you think that is bad?\n\nThat performance came against the Bengals, who have allowed the most yards in the NFL and the second-most points in the league. The fewest yards the Bengals had allowed previously was 317.\n\nGuess what? It gets even worse.\n\nThe 233 yards, as bad as it is for an offensive performance, is misleading.\n\nOf the 233 yards, 149 came in two fourth-quarter drives in clear garbage time. They trailed 37-7 before those two possessions. In the first three quarters, they had seven possessions, punted six times, picked up only four first downs and had only 84 yards. They went three-and-out five times.\n\nOf the 84 yards in the first three quarters, 70 came on their one touchdown drive in the second quarter, with 38 coming on Michael Wilson's touchdown. The other six possessions, they gained 14 yards.\n\nQuarterback Jacoby Brissett's final numbers looked fine, going 21-for-37 passing for 212 yards and two touchdowns. However, before the fourth quarter, he was 6-for-16 for 74 yards and a score, and 38 of those came on one play.\n\nOver the last eight games since the Cardinals beat the Dallas Cowboys and named Brissett the starter, the offense has averaged only 18.5 points per game and has not scored more than 20 points in the last six games. And that has happened while playing five games when losing by three or more scores, giving them plenty of garbage time to get easy yards and points.\n\nBrissett himself is having a solid statistical year. He has 21 touchdown passes to seven interceptions and has passed for a career-high 3,123 yards. However, those numbers come in the context of going 1-10 in his 11 starts and leading an offense that has gone downhill over the last two months. Even his numbers on Sunday didn't look bad, passing for 212 yards and two touchdowns, but 74 yards came before the Cardinals trailed by 30.\n\nSadly, it means that Brissett's numbers are largely empty numbers. What do they matter if they don't score consistently and trail most the game?\n\nAs bad as things looked early in the season, what we saw on Sunday was worse.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

    "fullText": "Will the Rams play their starters in Week 18 against the Cardinals? originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams saw their grip on the NFC’s top seed — and the NFC West title — disappear over the span of two weeks, leaving them headed into the postseason as a wild-card team.\n\nMonday night’s surprising loss to the Atlanta Falcons (7-9) sealed that reality, as the Rams (11-5) fell behind 21-0 by halftime and never fully recovered.\n\nThe defeat also effectively ended Matthew Stafford’s MVP momentum. By the break, the Rams quarterback had thrown multiple interceptions, and Los Angeles found itself chasing the game instead of controlling its postseason destiny. Although the Rams mounted a second-half comeback, the damage had already been done.\n\nWith one week left in the regular season, Los Angeles is now locked into either the fifth or sixth seed in the NFC, regardless of its Week 18 result. There’s also a scenario in which the Rams could be locked into the No. 6 seed before they even take the field Sunday afternoon, should the San Francisco 49ers win Saturday night. That possibility raised questions about whether head coach Sean McVay might choose to rest his starters against the Arizona Cardinals.\n\nMcVay, however, left little room for interpretation.\n\n“Oh, we’re playing. They’re playing,” he said postgame.\n\nAsked whether Monday night’s loss factored into that decision, McVay insisted the plan never changed, even though he has downplayed seeding in recent season finales. His focus, he said, is simply getting his team back on track before the playoffs.\n\n“They were going to play anyways,” he said. “We need to play. We need to play better football. I don’t know what the consequences are as far as those different types of things, but we’ve got to play better.”\n\nFor the Rams, Week 18 now serves less as a tune-up for seeding and more as a necessary reset heading into the postseason.",

    "description": "Vegas has dropped four of its last five and fell behind 5-0 to Minnesota Monday night.",
    "fullText": "And when the exact same scenario happened again in the second period, well, that’s just bad karma.\n\nOr maybe the blame lies with the Backstreet Boys, who showed up and cranked the rally siren prior to puck drop. Hey, when in doubt, blame the boy band.\n\nIn any event, the Golden Knights were due for a stinker and did they deliver Monday night at T-Mobile Arena. Vegas spotted the Minnesota Wild a 5-0 lead and it resulted in one of the Knights’ worst performances of the season, a 5-2 drubbing as they’ve now dropped four of their last five games.\n\nThe Knights were no-shows in their own building for much of the contest, much the way the Raiders failed to show up Sunday at Allegiant Stadium. The major difference was the Knights weren’t looking to lose and had no upside to getting beat.\n\n“They were on top of us early,” coach Bruce Cassidy said. “You’ve got to do a better job of getting out on the shooters. Too many easy plays for them.\n\n“We’ve got to plug some holes. It’s five goals (tonight). It’s five goals against Colorado. Five against Calgary. Four against Edmonton. We have to start there. We just have to. That’s an area we have to get better at.”\n\nFor Carter Hart, it was a night he’d just as soon forget. He was making his fourth straight start in goal and he was dented by Marcus Johansson 26 seconds into the match. He would surrender five goals on just 12 shots, including another Minnesota goal 26 seconds into the second period by Jared Spurgeon. Cassidy mercifully pulled him in favor of Akira Schmid after Joel Erikkson Ek tallied Minnesota’s fifth goal just shy of the seven-minute mark of the middle stanza.\n\nBut the Knights’ woes were just starting.\n\nTomas Hertl, who plays hard most shifts, crossed the line just over two minutes into the contest as he clobbered Ryan Hartman from behind along the boards in the Vegas end. He was assessed a five-minute boarding major along with a game misconduct.\n\nYet despite being shy for a long stretch, Vegas managed to avoid giving up a goal. For that, it can thank Brayden McNabb who prevented a sure goal by clearing the puck out of the crease before it could cross the goal line and into the net.McNabb would be the one who broke Filip Gustavsson’s shutout bid late in the second with a wrist shot from just inside the left circle to cut the deficit to 5-1. He was easily Vegas’ best player Monday night.\n\nThe Knights got as close as 5-2 on a Mark Stone goal early in the third period. But the Wild were not about to let this one get away from it. John Hynes’ guys settled down and while they couldn’t get one past Schmid, who stopped all 15 shots he faced in relief, Minnesota’s territorial play was good enough to secure the win, dropping the Knights into second place in the Pacific Division behind Edmonton, which won in Winnipeg Monday night, 3-1.\n\n“That goal to start the second period, we’re trying to get back in the game, we’ve got 40 minutes and the next goal, you’re right there. We’re one shot away,” Cassidy said. “But it didn’t happen and it snowballed from there.”  \n\nThey would lose defenseman Zach Whitecloud for a brief time in the third period after he and teammate Noah Hanifin collided and Whitecloud appeared to get the worst of it, unable to put weight on his left leg as left the ice and went down the tunnel to the Vegas dressing room. Whitecloud was able to return late in the period, which was good news.\n\nThere was more good news from earlier in the day, as center Jack Eichel participated in a red non-contact jersey during the team’s morning skate. And while Eichel didn’t play against the Wild, his sixth straight game he has missed with a lower-body injury and illness, he could return Wednesday for the New Year’s Eve matinee against Nashville.\n\nStill, this was a night the Golden Knights would just as soon forget. And they’ll get a chance to put this one behind them in less than 48 hours.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea host Bournemouth at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday night, knowing a win would provide a timely lift before the curtain falls on 2025.\n\nThe Blues are heading into this must-win contest after a frustrating 2-1 defeat against Aston Villa.\n\nEnzo Maresca’s side dominated the opening proceedings with Joao Pedro giving Chelsea the lead in the 37th minute after steering home a dangerous Reece James free kick.\n\nChelsea restricted Villa from having the ball and made sure Unai Emery’s troops went into the break without recording a single shot.\n\nFor an hour, the Blues were in cruise control until Ollie Watkins entered the fray and helped Villa turn the game on its head.\n\nChelsea capitulated in front of their own fans as Watkins bagged a brace to end the Blues’ four-match unbeaten home run.\n\nThat defeat saw Chelsea slip to fifth in the table, three points behind Liverpool and only ahead of Manchester United on goal difference.\n\nMaresca will be uneasy that his side have now won just once in their last five league outings (D2, L2) – a run that includes a goalless draw away to Bournemouth earlier this month.\n\nChelsea will take some confidence from the fact that they’ve won two of their last three home games against the Cherries, although James’ late free kick spared their blushes in the most recent 2-2 draw.\n\nHowever, the Blues tend to fare well when they wrap up the year on home turf, losing just one of their last 22 such games (W13, D8).\n\nThe wheels began to come off for Chelsea when Maresca made a handful of second-half changes that allowed Villa back into the game.\n\nThey were untouchable for an hour, so Maresca will likely stick to the same XI, although there could be a minor tweak due to fitness concerns.\n\nRobert Sanchez is guaranteed to start in goal. Wesley Fofana could return to the XI to partner Trevoh Chalobah.\n\nMalo Gusto could also come in for James, who put in an 8/10 performance in the Villa defeat.\n\nMaresca may opt to rest James from the start while Marc Cucurella retains his spot at left back.\n\nMoises Caicedo and Enzo Fernandez should continue to anchor the midfield while Pedro Neto, Cole Palmer, and Alejandro Garnacho form the supporting cast behind striker Joao Pedro.",

    "fullText": "Tottenham Hotspur defender Radu Dragusin has opened up on his long recovery journey after undergoing surgery to correct an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) damage.\n\nThe 23-year-old centre back strained his ACL in the latter stages of Tottenham’s 3-0 Europa League win over Elfsborg back in February.\n\nDragusin has been working on getting back to full fitness and even featured in a behind-closed-doors friendly game.\n\nThe Romanian centre-back finally marked his return in Tottenham’s narrow 1-0 win against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park after nearly a year on the sidelines.\n\nHis five-minute cameo in the London derby helped Tottenham’s cause as they held on to claim a crucial victory after back-to-back defeats against Nottingham Forest and Liverpool.\n\nDragusin has admitted that his 11-month journey to recovery tested him both physically and mentally – one he now calls the biggest challenge of his life.\n\n“It’s been a long journey, the biggest challenge of my life,” he told SPURSPLAY. “I just kept going. I had people next to me who helped me, my team-mates, my family, and my fiance.\n\n“I knew the road was going to be long, but I knew there was going to be a light at the end of it. Today, I’ve seen the light. I can’t even describe the feeling I’m having.”\n\nDragusin has wasted no time outlining his target for 2026. The centre-back is convinced he has what it takes to fight for a starting role and is eager to prove himself from the start of the new year.\n\n“I learned to have patience and believe in doing the right things over and over again,” he added.\n\n“A big part of my recovery was just doing the same things over and over again, just to get better at it and have a normal knee again.\n\n“It looks easy, but it’s a pretty big thing that the surgeon did in my knee. So, just to come back from that and perform at the level the Premier League asks you to perform, it takes time.\n\n“I’m just hoping to come back onto the pitch and fight for my place. Hopefully, this year is going to be an even better one than 2025 for us as a team.”",

The president said he was \"getting pretty close,\" adding, \"I would fire him.\"\n\nHe said he would announce Powell's replacement sometime in January. His comments came at the end of the briefing, which he held with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nDuring the briefing, Trump threw several insults at Powell, calling him \"an absolute fool.\" He also brought out a common insult, \"too late Powell,\" a reference to Powell not lowering interest rates as quickly as Trump wanted him to.\n\nTrump said he would launch a \"gross incompetence lawsuit\" against the Fed chair, repeating his old criticisms of Powell not lowering interest rates and spending too much on a renovation of the Federal Reserve building.\n\nIn response to a request for comment from Business Insider, a Fed representative said he had nothing to add.\n\nPowell, 72, has served as the Fed's chair since 2017, when Trump nominated him to the top job during his first term. He was reappointed for a second term in 2022, which is set to end in May 2026.\n\nTrump has repeatedly called for Powell's resignation since the start of his term.\n\nIn April, he said in a Truth Social post that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough,\" after the chair criticized his wide-ranging tariffs and said they could lead to high inflation and weak economic growth.\n\nIn July, sources confirmed to Business Insider that Trump had asked a group of lawmakers about firing Powell, and they gave him their approval for the decision.\n\nHowever, Trump appeared to backtrack that same month, saying that he was \"highly unlikely\" to take that step and that his administration would choose someone else for the role within the next eight months.",

    "fullText": "Several passengers on a Ryanair flight travelling from Birmingham to Tenerife were injured after the aircraft encountered turbulence shortly after takeoff, forcing it to return to the UK.\n\nRyanair said in a statement to Business Insider that flight FR1121, which departed Birmingham Airport on Sunday, turned back \"shortly after take-off due to air turbulence.\"\n\n\"The aircraft landed normally before passengers disembarked and returned to the terminal, where a small number of passengers were provided with medical assistance,\" the airline said. The flight later resumed its journey to Tenerife, departing again at 9:06 p.m. local time, it added.\n\nFlight-tracking data from Flightradar24 shows the Boeing 737 Max departed Birmingham at about 3:05 p.m. on December 28, about 15 minutes later than its scheduled departure time.\n\nThe flight-tracking website said in a post on X on Monday that the aircraft squawked 7700 as it returned to Birmingham. The transponder code is a general emergency signal used by pilots to alert air-traffic controllers that the plane requires immediate assistance.\n\nThe aircraft also descended to about 10,000 feet during the diversion back to Birmingham, according to Flightradar24. Flightradar24 said on X that such a descent \"often indicates an aircraft pressurization issue.\"\n\nRyanair did not respond to Business Insider's questions about the number of passengers who required medical assistance, when the turbulence occurred, or the procedures followed on board.\n\nThe incident adds to a growing list of turbulence-related disruptions this year, as the climate crisis increases the risk of turbulence.\n\nA Delta Air Lines plane was hit by \"significant\" turbulence while flying over Wyoming in July, injuring 25 people, the airline said.\n\nAviation experts have warned that turbulence can appear suddenly and can pose risks to passengers who are not seated or wearing seatbelts.",

    "description": "China is weighing new controls on AI training, requiring consent before chat logs can be used to improve chatbots and virtual companions.",
    "fullText": "China is moving to tighten one of the most common ways AI systems improve: Learning directly from conversations with users.\n\nThe Cyberspace Administration of China said in a statement published Saturday that it has drafted measures that would restrict how AI platforms can collect and use chat logs for model training.\n\nThe proposal aims to ensure that \"human-like\" interactive AI services, including chatbots and virtual companions, are safe and secure for users, the statement said.\n\nChina encourages innovation in \"human-like\" interactive AI, but will pair that with governance and prudent, tiered supervision to \"prevent abuse and loss of control,\" it added.\n\nUnder the draft rules, platforms would need to inform users when they are interacting with AI and provide options to access or delete their chat history. Using conversation data for model training — or sharing it with third parties — would require explicit user consent, the agency said.\n\nFor minors, providers would need additional consent from a guardian before sharing their conversation data with third parties. Guardians would also have the right to request deletion of a minor's chat history.\n\nThe draft measures are open for public consultation, with feedback due in late January.\n\nIf finalized, the rules could slow the pace at which AI chatbots improve, Lian Jye Su, the chief analyst at Omdia, a technology research and consulting firm, told Business Insider.\n\nRestricting access to chat logs may \"limit the human-feedback mechanisms in reinforcement learning, which has been critical to the rise of engaging and accurate conversational AI,\" Su said.\n\nThat said, China's AI ecosystem is \"robust,\" and the country has access to massive public and proprietary datasets, he added.\n\nSu said the move aligns with Beijing's broader emphasis on national security and the collective public interest. Tightening controls over chat logs signals that certain user conversations are too sensitive to be treated as free training data, he added.\n\nWei Sun, the principal analyst for AI at Counterpoint Research, told Business Insider these provisions \"function less as brakes and more as directional signals.\"\n\n\"The emphasis is on protecting users and preventing opaque data practices, rather than constraining innovation,\" she said.\n\nSun said the draft encourages providers — once safety and reliability are proven — to expand the use of human-like AI across more application areas, including cultural dissemination and companionship for older adults.\n\n\"In the context of a rapidly aging population, they can be read as an explicit policy nudge to accelerate the development of human-like AI interactions in a regulated, socially constructive, and scalable manner,\" she added.\n\nChina's new draft rules on chatlog data come as concerns grow over how AI companies handle deeply personal user conversations.\n\nBusiness Insider reported in August that contract workers employed by Meta and other tech giants can read user conversations with chatbots as part of the process of evaluating AI responses.\n\nSeveral contractors told Business Insider that the material they reviewed contained sensitive details that could be used to identify individual users. Many of the conversations were highly personal, including exchanges that resembled therapy sessions, private chats with close friends, or intimate conversations with romantic partners.\n\nMeta's AI terms of service said that it \"may review\" user chatlogs with its AI products, either through automated systems or human reviewers.\n\nA Meta spokesperson told Business Insider that the company has \"strict policies\" over who can access personal data.\n\n\"While we work with contractors to help improve training data quality, we intentionally limit what personal information they see, and we have processes and guardrails in place instructing them how to handle any such information they may encounter,\" the spokesperson said in the August report.\n\nA Google engineer in AI security told Business Insider earlier this month that there are certain things he would never share with chatbots.\n\n\"AI models use data to generate helpful responses, and we users need to protect our private information so that harmful entities, like cybercriminals and data brokers, can't access it,\" he said.",

But I also think at the same time, not everybody is going to win at this.\"\n\nKatzenberg served as chairman of Walt Disney Studios for 10 years until 1994 and cofounded DreamWorks after his departure. As DreamWorks' CEO, he oversaw the production of hits like \"Shrek,\" \"Madagascar,\" and \"Kung Fu Panda.\"\n\nHe stepped down in 2016 and cofounded the venture capital firm WndrCo with former Dropbox Chief Financial Officer Sujay Jaswa in 2017. WndrCo's investments include Cursor, Harvey, and Figma.\n\nWndrCo's general partner, ChenLi Wang, also shared on the podcast how he and Katzenberg evaluate startups in the AI era.\n\n\"First, I think through our entire careers pre-WndrCo, Jeffrey's entire career, we've been people people,\" Wang said. \"The ingenuity and creativity of people and how magical their spikes are, and how, when you complement people and what they can create together, is the secret sauce.\"\n\nWang added that he and Katzenberg have never \"assessed our best humans based on benchmarks.\"\n\n\"I mean, how many years have people have parents complained about standardized testing dumbing down their kids,\" Wang said. \"And yet, I think we're going down the same route with the first wave of benchmarks.\"\n\nLike the two partners, research scientists have also criticized benchmarks because they overvalue superficial traits.\n\nIn a March blog post, Dean Valentine, the cofounder and CEO of AI security startup ZeroPath, said that \"recent AI model progress feels mostly like bullshit.\"\n\nValentine said that he and his team had been evaluating the performance of different models claiming to have \"some sort of improvement\" since the release of Anthropic's 3.5 Sonnet in June 2024. None of the new models his team tried had made a \"significant difference\" in his company's internal benchmarks or in developers' abilities to find new bugs, he said.\n\nIn a February paper titled \"Can we trust AI Benchmarks?\" researchers at the European Commission's Joint Research Center found that major issues exist in the current evaluation approach.\n\nThe researchers said that benchmarks \"often prioritize state-of-the-art performance at the expense of broader societal concerns.\"",

    "title": "Glamorous Christmas: Bringing Charm to Ruby",
    "description": "marcoroth.dev - website and blog",
    "fullText": "Today, Ruby 4.0 was released. What an exciting milestone for the language!\n\nThis release brings some amazing new features like the experimental Ruby::Box isolation mechanism, the new ZJIT compiler, significant performance improvements for class instantiation, and promotions of Set and Pathname to core classes. It’s incredible to see how Ruby continues to thrive and be pushed forward 30 years after its first release.\n\nTo celebrate this release, I’m happy to announce that I’ve been working on porting the Charmbracelet Go terminal libraries to Ruby, and today I’m releasing a first version of them. What better way to make this Ruby 4.0 release a little more glamorous and charming?\n\nI’ve been a huge fan of the Charm terminal libraries for years. I’ve always loved the aesthetics and the look & feel of the Charm libraries. Every time I see a CLI tool built with them, I get a little envious. The attention to detail, the smooth animations, the gorgeous styling, it all just feels right. I’ve spent more time than I’d like to admit just playing around with their demos and admiring how polished everything looks.\n\nFor a long time, I wished we had something like this in Ruby. So I finally decided to stop wishing and start building. Spoiler: some of these are pure Ruby ports, while others are bindings to their Go-library counterparts.\n\nCharmbracelet is an open source project building tools for the terminal. Their tagline is “We make the command line glamorous.”, and they truly deliver on that promise.\n\nThe Charm team believes that developer experience is user experience. APIs and CLIs are user interfaces at the end of the day, and they deserve the same care and attention as any visual design. This philosophy has led them to build some of the most beautiful and well-designed terminal libraries in any language.\n\nWhat sets Charm apart is that their tools make people feel something. When you see a Charm-powered application for the first time, there’s a moment of delight, a “wow, I didn’t know the terminal could look like this.” That’s not an accident. It’s the result of caring deeply about craft and aesthetics in a space where most tools are purely functional.\n\nOne of their key insights was separating structure from style, mirroring how the web separates HTML from CSS. Lipgloss handles styling and layout, while Bubble Tea provides the application architecture. This separation makes it easy to build complex UIs without mixing concerns.\n\nThe Charm libraries are thoughtfully designed with composable pieces that work together beautifully:\n\nEach library solves one problem well, and together they form a complete toolkit for building beautiful terminal applications.\n\nRuby has always been a joy to work with. They say Ruby is a programmer’s best friend, and I think that’s true. For 30 years, the language has embodied a philosophy of making coding more human, intuitive, and enjoyable. Matz built Ruby around the Principle of Least Surprise, valuing craftsmanship and expressive code over hype-driven trends. It’s a language that cares about how things feel.\n\nCharm shares that same DNA. Their tools prioritize developer happiness, expressiveness, and craft. When I discovered Charm, I immediately thought: this belongs in Ruby.\n\nWe have great tools for building CLIs, but when it comes to building rich, interactive, beautiful terminal applications, we’ve been missing the kind of cohesive ecosystem that Charm provides for Go.\n\nI wanted to change that. Ruby developers deserve glamorous terminals too. I want Ruby developers to build terminal applications so beautiful that even people who “don’t like CLIs” find themselves captivated.\n\nThese ports aim to bring that same level of polish and developer experience to Ruby. Quick script or full-blown TUI app, you should be able to make it look stunning with minimal effort.\n\nThis project is part of a broader movement happening in the Ruby community. Over the past few years, we’ve seen an incredible focus on improving the developer experience, and it’s been driven by a key insight: strategic standardization enables innovation.\n\nJust as Rails revolutionized web development by standardizing conventions, the Ruby ecosystem is now applying the same principle to developer tooling. By standardizing foundational layers, we free ourselves to build richer, more powerful tools on top.\n\nThis extends beyond individual tools. Protocols like LSP (Language Server Protocol), DAP (Debug Adapter Protocol), and now MCP (Model Context Protocol) provide shared infrastructure that unifies how tools communicate. Instead of every editor implementing language support from scratch, LSP gives us a common language. Instead of every debugger reinventing the wheel, DAP provides a shared foundation. These protocols enable an explosion of interoperable tooling.\n\nAnd that’s the key insight: when you build strong foundations, the community builds incredible things on top. Give developers the right building blocks, and they’ll create tools you never imagined.\n\nThis story extends across the Ruby ecosystem:\n\nThe Ruby ecosystem is investing heavily in making the development experience more polished, more intelligent, and more delightful. From better editor support to faster parsers to type checking, Ruby is leveling up.\n\nBringing Charm to Ruby fits right into this story. It’s about raising the bar for what Ruby developers can build and how good it can look. The terminal is often where we spend our time as developers, and it deserves the same attention to developer experience as our editors and IDEs.\n\nCSS-like styling for terminal output. Define colors, borders, padding, margins, and alignment with a clean, chainable API. Includes support for tables, lists, and tree structures.\n\nThe Elm-inspired TUI framework. Build interactive terminal applications using the Model-View-Update architecture.\n\nPre-built TUI components for Bubble Tea: spinners, progress bars, text inputs, text areas, viewports, lists, tables, file pickers, and more.\n\nStylesheet-based Markdown rendering for the terminal. Supports syntax highlighting, multiple themes, and custom styles via a Ruby DSL.\n\nA simple, powerful library for building interactive forms and prompts. Includes inputs, selects, multi-selects, confirms, spinners, validation, and theming.\n\nA simple, physics-based animation library. Damped spring oscillators for smooth, natural motion in your terminal UIs.\n\nMouse event zones for TUIs. Mark regions as clickable and easily determine which component was clicked in your Bubble Tea applications.\n\nMark regions with zone identifiers\n\nCheck if mouse event is in bounds\n\nA tool for glamorous shell scripts. Ruby wrapper for Charm’s gum binary with an idiomatic API for inputs, selects, confirms, spinners, styled output, and more.\n\nNimble Terminal Charts. Visualize data beautifully with sparklines, bar charts, line charts, time series, heatmaps, and more.\n\nAll gems (except huh) are available on RubyGems.org:\n\nFor huh, add it to your Gemfile from GitHub (we reached out to the current owner of the huh gem and are hoping to be able to publish the gem under the huh name in the future):\n\nYou can find more information at charm-ruby.dev. All libraries are open source and available on GitHub:\n\nThis is just the beginning. These are initial releases, and there’s plenty more to do.\n\nThe first pass was primarily focused on getting the Go functionality ported to Ruby. Now the real work begins: making these libraries feel more Ruby-like and idiomatic. I want to improve how the libraries work and integrate with each other, add more pre-built components, and make it even easier to get started building beautiful terminal applications.\n\nThese are early releases, and there’s still work to be done. Some of the Go-based gems have quirks when used together due to how Goroutines are initialized. I’m actively working on these, and I’d rather build in public with the community than wait for everything to be perfect.\n\nBut here’s what really excites me: imagine what we could build together. Think about all the CLI tools, test runners, generators, installers, and framework scripts we use every day.\n\nWhat if they were all a little more polished, a little more interactive, a little more glamorous? Rails generators with beautiful progress indicators. Test runners with live, filterable output. Bundler with elegant spinners and styled summaries. Or entirely new applications that weren’t really possible before, but now are. The possibilities are endless!\n\nI couldn’t wait to start exploring, so here are a couple of things I’ve been experimenting with:\n\nA Minitest plugin that uses Bubble Tea to run your tests with a beautiful, interactive interface. Inspired by Vitest’s terminal UI. The UI stays open after the run completes, letting you re-run the failed tests, filter to focus on specific tests, and enjoy a clean collapsible view that tucks away individual test cases when a file passes. Expand any file to see the details, or just enjoy the satisfying wall of green checkmarks. (You can also see the standalone Bubble Tea test runner demo in the Bubble Tea demos above.)\n\nA terminal rebuild of the Herb Playground, built entirely with these libraries. Type HTML+ERB code and switch between tabs to explore the parsed AST, tokens, extracted Ruby, extracted HTML, and any parser errors, all in a beautiful split-pane terminal UI.\n\nA special thank you to Anton Sozontov for transferring the gum gem name on RubyGems.org, and to Tomas Valent for transferring the bubbles gem name.\n\nThe terminal has been around for decades, but that doesn’t mean it has to feel dated. With the right tools, you can build software that genuinely delights.\n\nI hope these libraries inspire you to craft something that makes people stop and say “wow.”\n\nBut more than anything, I want to encourage you to build with these libraries. Build new tools. Upgrade your existing CLI applications to make them shinier, more glamorous, more beautiful. Add some color, some polish, some fun.\n\nThe terminal doesn’t have to be boring. Let’s make it glamorous.\n\nI’d love to hear your feedback and see what you create! You can find all the libraries at charm-ruby.dev and browse the full collection on my GitHub list.\n\nHappy Ruby 4.0 release day! Let’s make the Ruby command line glamorous.\n\nCode blocks highlighted by Torchlight.",

    "fullText": "The satellites were placed into orbit from Russia’s Vostochny Cosmodrome in a multi-payload launch that Iranian officials described as the country’s seventh satellite mission carried out using Russian launch vehicles.\n\n“These satellites were designed and manufactured by Iranian scientists, and both government bodies and the private sector have been involved,” Iran’s ambassador to Russia, Kazem Jalali, said in remarks published ahead of the launch.\n\n“Two of the satellites belong to the government and one belongs to the private sector, and our knowledge-based companies and universities are active in this field.”\n\nJalali said Iran had continued to advance its space capabilities despite international pressure. “Despite all the threats and sanctions that exist, we have something to say in this field.”\n\nIran’s space agency chief, Hassan Salarieh, said the launch reflected what he described as Iran’s standing among a small group of countries with end-to-end space capabilities.\n\n“Iran is among 10 or 11 countries in the world that simultaneously possess the capability to design and build satellites, launch vehicles and the infrastructure for launching, receiving data and processing images,” he said.\n\nSalarieh said Iran aimed to expand both the number and precision of its satellites. “What is necessary for us is increasing the number of satellites, improving their accuracy and quality, and developing different classes of satellites,” he said.\n\nIranian media identified the satellites as Paya, also known as Tolou-3, Zafar-2, and a prototype satellite called Kowsar-1.5. The spacecraft were launched alongside a large cluster of mainly Russian satellites into a sun-synchronous low Earth orbit.\n\nPaya (Tolou-3), built by the Iranian Space Agency, is Iran’s heaviest Earth-observation satellite to date, weighing about 150 kilograms.\n\nIranian officials say it is capable of producing black-and-white images with a resolution of about five meters and color images with a resolution of around 10 meters, and is intended for applications including agriculture, water management, environmental monitoring and disaster assessment.\n\nZafar-2, developed by Iran University of Science and Technology, is also an Earth-observation satellite designed for mapping, environmental monitoring and tracking natural hazards.\n\nKowsar-1.5 combines imaging and internet-of-things capabilities and is aimed primarily at agricultural and farm-monitoring uses, Iranian officials say.\n\nJalali described Iran’s space cooperation with Russia as extensive and said Moscow’s experience had played a key role.\n\n“Russia is advanced in the space field, including satellites, launch vehicles and satellite launches, and we have been able to transfer part of the technology and work together,” he said.\n\nHe also described the Soyuz rocket as highly reliable. “Before Russia’s relations with the West deteriorated, many Western satellites were launched using Soyuz,” Jalali said.\n\nThe launch also carried Russian Earth-observation satellites, internet-of-things platforms and university-built spacecraft, according to launch data, as well as satellites from partner countries including Belarus, Kuwait and Montenegro.\n\nIran says its space program is civilian and focused on scientific and economic goals, but Western governments argue that satellite launch technology overlaps with systems used to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles.\n\n“In my view, we are in an all-out war with the United States, Israel, and Europe; they do not want our country to stand on its own feet,” Masoud Pezeshkian said in an interview with the Supreme Leader’s official website.\n\nHe said the current war is worse than the Iraq war in the 1980s. “If one understands it properly, this war is far more complex and more difficult than that war.”\n\n“In the war with Iraq, the situation was clear; they fired missiles, and it was clear where we would strike back. But here, they are now besieging us in every respect, putting us under pressure and in tight corners, creating problems—economically, culturally, politically, and in terms of security.”\n\nPezeshkian made the comments on the eve of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's trip to the United States, where he plans to brief President Donald Trump on options for potential future strikes against Iran, amid concerns that Tehran is rebuilding ballistic missile production facilities and repairing air defenses damaged during the June conflict, according to NBC News.\n\nIsrael has told the United States that the recent Iranian missile drills may conceal preparations for a potential strike, Axios reported last Sunday, one day after Iran International reported unusual Iranian air activity spotted by Western intelligence agencies.\n\nIsraeli Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir raised the issue directly with Brad Cooper, head of US Central Command, warning that recent missile movements could serve as a cover for a surprise operation against the Jewish state.\n\nPezeshkian said on Saturday that Iran is \"stronger than during the 12‑day war\" with Israel in terms of equipment and manpower. \"If the enemy chooses confrontation, they will naturally face a more decisive response.\"\n\nIn June, Israel carried out airstrikes and covert operations against Iranian military and nuclear sites, killing more than 1,000 people including senior officials and nuclear scientists.\n\nIran retaliated by launching hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel, killing at least 33 people, among them an off-duty soldier.\n\nThe United States helped Israel intercept Iranian attacks and later joined the Israeli campaign, bombing three Iranian nuclear facilities on June 22.\n\n“In a joint operation by the IDF and the Shin Bet, Hussein Mahmoud Marshad al-Jawhari, a key operative in the Operations Unit of the Iranian Quds Force, was eliminated,” the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement posted on X.\n\n\"(al-Jawhari) operated under the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and was involved in terror activities directed by Iran against the State of Israel and security forces,\" the statement added.\n\nThe IDF said he was involved in “advancing terrorist attack plans against the State of Israel in the Syria–Lebanon arena.”\n\nIt added that al-Jawhari was a key operative in Quds Force’s Unit 840, which the IDF described as “the unit that directs and is responsible for Iranian terrorist activity against the State of Israel.”\n\nThe Quds Force, the external arm of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, conducts overseas operations to support allied groups and advance Tehran’s strategic interests.\n\nLebanon’s state news agency had earlier reported that two people were killed when an Israeli drone struck a vehicle near the Syrian border.\n\nA report by Israel Hayom, citing Israeli officials, said al-Jawhari was killed alongside another operative, identified as Majed Qansoua.\n\nA US-backed ceasefire agreed last November halted more than a year of fighting between Israel and Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah and called for the group to disarm.\n\nBoth Israel and Hezbollah have since accused each other of violating the ceasefire.\n\nIsrael has been carrying out strikes in Lebanon on an almost daily basis, which it says are aimed at preventing Hezbollah from rebuilding.\n\nIran, a longtime sponsor of Hezbollah, has rejected international and domestic calls for the group to disarm, arguing that continued Israeli actions justify its armed presence.\n\nOn Wednesday, former Afghan police general Ikramuddin Sari was shot dead by masked assailants near his home in Tehran, according to sources close to him.\n\nHe was attacked alongside an associate near their residence in southern Tehran and died while being transferred to hospital, the sources told Afghanistan International.\n\nSari, a former police commander in Baghlan and Takhar provinces, fled to Iran after the Taliban returned to power in 2021. Reports in recent months had suggested Iranian police had detained and questioned him, though no official explanation was given.\n\nTaliban's 'extraterritorial assassinations'\n\nThe killing follows the September shooting of Maroof Ghulami, a political and military figure close to veteran anti-Taliban leader Ismail Khan. He was killed by gunfire in the religious city of Mashhad.\n\nPeople close to both men have blamed the Taliban for their deaths, according to Afghanistan International.\n\nThe attacks, an Afghan military source said, signal the start of what he described as Taliban “extraterritorial assassinations,” adding that the group has repeatedly threatened to target opponents abroad.\n\nSenior Taliban official Mohammad Nabi Omari has previously said the group could kill opponents outside Afghanistan “with as little as 500 Pakistani rupees,” while Saeed Khosti, a former spokesperson for the de facto Taliban Ministry of Interior, warned two years ago that hundreds of volunteers were ready to target critics overseas.\n\nIranian authorities have remained publicly silent on Sari’s killing. Tehran has also provided no detailed update on the investigation into Ghulami’s death.\n\nIranian police said in September they arrested three suspects in that case but later released two, offering no clarity on affiliations.\n\nA source familiar with the investigation told Afghanistan International that the remaining suspect was a Taliban operative, a comment not confirmed by Iranian authorities.\n\nSari, originally from Kapisa province, was regarded as a professional officer who served as police commander in Nuristan, Baghlan and Takhar, and as an adviser to Afghanistan’s interior ministry.\n\nIn Iran, he acted as an informal representative for former Afghan soldiers, advocating for their rights, opposing deportations and openly criticizing the Taliban.\n\nThe National Resistance Front of Afghanistan (NRF), led by Ahmad Massoud, called on Iran to conduct a “transparent, serious and independent” investigation, describing Sari’s killing as a “targeted terrorist act.”\n\nThe Jamiat-e Islami Afghanistan, led by Salahuddin Rabbani, also condemned the killing and urged Iranian authorities to identify those responsible.\n\nIran, which has handed Afghanistan’s embassy in Tehran and the consulate in Mashhad to the Taliban, has faced growing criticism for failing to protect Afghan dissidents on its soil even as it seeks closer ties with the Taliban-led administration.\n\n“Israel does not have the capacity for an intense war of attrition or for confronting a major power like Iran, and it is clear that another war would not end in 12 days as the previous one did,” Javan wrote in an analysis on Wednesday.\n\nThe 12-day war between Iran and Israel in June 2025 was a brief but intense conflict. It began with extensive Israeli airstrikes on Iranian military and nuclear facilities.\n\nThe United States became militarily involved mid‑conflict. On June 22, US Air Force and Navy forces carried out coordinated strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities – Natanz, Fordow and Isfahan – in an operation codenamed Operation Midnight Hammer, using B‑2 bombers and submarine‑launched missiles, marking the first US offensive against Iranian territory in decades. Iranian forces fired missiles at US assets in Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, after those strikes.\n\nThe conflict ended with a US and Qatari-mediated ceasefire, but it caused significant casualties, infrastructure damage.\n\nIsraeli rhetoric, the paper said, has shifted from threats of decisive victory to language of caution and warnings about the costs of renewed conflict.\n\nAir strikes, according to Javan, failed to halt what it called Iran’s “distributed and self-sufficient” military production. The paper also argued that the previous fighting severely strained Israel’s multilayer missile defense systems.\n\n“Israeli officials are now openly speaking of the ‘real threat’ posed by Iran’s missiles and warning that without preventive action Iran could reach annual production of thousands of missiles,” the paper said.\n\nFocus shifts from battlefield to society\n\nJavan framed the change in tone as evidence that the military option has lost credibility, writing that the inability to control the consequences of war has weakened Israel’s long-standing doctrine of absolute military superiority.\n\n“War in the contemporary world is not merely a military confrontation, but a test of social capacity, political cohesion and national resilience,” the paper wrote, arguing that internal divisions, political strains and reliance on external support limit Israel’s ability to endure a prolonged conflict.\n\nThe article concluded that future confrontation will be shaped as much by narratives and domestic resilience as by missiles and air defenses.",

    "fullText": "“Every driver has a limit.  Mine is a little bit further than others.”\n\n— Ayrton Senna, greatest Formula One driver of all time\n‍\n\n“I’m not funny.  What I am is brave.”\n\n— Lucille Ball, greatest female comedian of all time\n‍\n\n“I’d rather be optimistic and wrong than pessimistic and right.”\n\n“I can outlearn you.  \nI can outread you.  \nI can outthink you.  \nAnd I can outphilosophize you.”\n\n— Robert De Niro as Max Cady, Cape Fear‍\n‍\n\n“I’m not superstitious, but I am a little stitious.”\n\n— Michael Scott, The Office, on how Bayesians form priors\n‍\n\nThe greatest treasure hunters know that the treasure they seek is not lost. It is waiting.\n\nStarting in 1969 and for 5,954 straight days, treasure hunter Mel Fisher sought what was waiting for him: the wreckage of the Nuestra Señora de Atocha, a Spanish galleon that sunk in 1622.\n\nHow do you recruit, retain, and motivate a crew when you are not sure when you will find the treasure, if you will find the treasure, or what the treasure will be worth? Fisher developed a powerful operating philosophy, captured in its entirety with three amazing words.\n\nEvery morning, for 16 years, Mel Fisher banged pots and pans in the pre-sunrise to rouse his crew, shouting and smiling, “Today’s the day, men. Today’s the day.”\n\nEventually it was true. On July 20, 1985, Mel and his crew discovered the most valuable shipwreck in history, 70 miles off the coast of Key West. The Atocha yielded gold and silver today worth more than $10 billion.\n\nFisher’s “today’s the day” philosophy reframed what could have otherwise been a mentally tortuous journey – will we ever find the treasure? Is it even here? – into daily play characterized by disciplined guessing, dispassionate refinement, and the singular goal of ending the day less wrong.\n\nFisher had never studied, or even heard of, Bayesian statistics. Yet, as we will see, his operating philosophy, and its daily ritual of iteration, was textbook Bayesian. Fisher also settled – for me – a foundationally important debate I had struggled with about the philosophy of probability theory which, in turn, provided me with an operating manual for leadership.\n\nArriving at the University of Chicago’s Ph.D. program in 1991, I, like Fisher, had never studied, or even heard of, Bayesian statistics. Yet, exposure the first day of my first class turned into a wandering, wondering, and still unabated obsession. I left the program five years later with a Ph.D. in Bayesian statistics (and finance), and my career has essentially been a three-decade extension of what I learned at Chicago. I now do Bayesian treasure hunting for a living.\n\nFancy math aside, the foundational idea of Bayesian statistics is simply learning from experience. Things get started with a “prior distribution”, which is what you think you know about what you want to know – for example, “Where is the treasure?” That “prior” is mixed with observable data – experience – to form a “posterior distribution”, a structured mashup of your prior and the data you collected.  The posterior represents your new view of what you want to know – for example, “I now know the treasure is not over there.”i\n\nThe power of Bayesian statistics is in the trade-off inherent in the framework. How much do you listen to your pre-wisdom intuition before it is enhanced by the data you collect, knowing your pre-data knowledge is limited, at best? How much do you listen to your new data, especially if it contradicts your pre-data intuition, knowing your limited sample may not lead you closer to the treasure, and might even throw you off the trail?\n\nWhen done with mastery, Bayesian statistics is a beautiful, egoless, daily practice of being less wrong.\n\nIn hindsight, every incoming University of Chicago Ph.D. student in 1991 – our collaborative little group of intellectually hungry sponges – was susceptible to becoming a Bayesian. Arnold Zellner, a giant in the history of Bayesian econometrics, towered, gently, over the business school’s statistics department, having just been named President of the American Statistical Association and – to me – a hilarious, wonderful, deeply caring professor. And though my own research was – and still is – focused on empirical asset pricing, my six-man dissertation committee ended up including four Bayesian statisticians, each a legend in the field.\n\nI recall as if it were yesterday my dissertation co-chairman Rob McCulloch teaching me that the Bayesian-required question “how do we set our priors?” illuminated a philosophical debate, still raging, about probability theory because that simple question is akin to asking, “What can we know prior to knowing?” I thought about that deeply for years.\n\nStudying Fisher, and treasure hunting, I now know that the answer is, often, a lot.\n\n“What’s an expert anyway? Just some guy from out of town.”\n\nConsider that Fisher knew to search off the coast of Florida and not, say, Australia. How? During his pre-search research at the Archivo General de Indias in Seville, Fisher discovered a faded 1622 salvage account describing the treasure fleet’s loss and references to survivors setting up camp in Cayos del Marques, or Key Largo today. So, Fisher’s prior variance was very large to start – search the Florida Keys – but not practically infinite – search all 140 million square miles of water on the surface of the planet.ii\n\nKnowing roughly where the Atocha sank and roughly the seasonal path of the current – that is, knowing prior to knowing before collecting any data from the sea – Fisher literally, and massively, shrunk the problem. Bayesian shrinkage, a foundational element of Bayesian statistics, involves pulling in especially noisy estimates – say, all oceans on Earth – closer to a central value – say, water off the coast of Florida. My dissertation – which applied new computational techniques in Bayesian shrinkage to old problems in finance – helped me see Fisher as a Bayesian.\n\nEvery day, Fisher, like any good Bayesian, updated his prior guess of where the Atocha was with data about where it definitely was not. Every day Fisher became a little less wrong.\n\nIn finding the Atocha in 16 years – and not 60, or never – Fisher adhered to Bayesian-adjacent principles that Alec Litowitz, founder of Magnetar Capital, and my former boss and mentor, writes about in his forthcoming and fascinating field guide for success, The Adaptability Quotient: Rewiring Your Mind for Success in the Next Human Era:\n\n“Confirmation bias is the worst enemy of iteration.  In a Bayesian system, it’s fatal. If you only accept the data that supports your hypothesis, you’re not updating – you’re entrenching. The people who learn fastest are the ones who are most willing to be wrong…with the humility to trade conviction for information, one update at a time.”\n\nFisher let the data speak and learned fast. In 1973, he found silver bars and coins matching the Atocha’s manifest.  Less wrong. Two years later, he discovered bronze cannons with Atocha markings. Even less wrong. Ten years after that, the motherlode. Absolutely right.\n\nAs students of the great Chicago Bayesians, we at Stone Ridge seek continual improvement in the speed of unbiased iterations. We are trained to privately ask ourselves, “Was I less wrong today?” Our progress depends on our eruptions of good questions, and truly listening to the answers. We would rather look dumb by asking, than not ask and be dumb. People forget if you looked dumb. They do not if you are.\n\nAs students of the great Bayesian Fisher, we at Stone Ridge know that success is not always linked to intelligence, boldness, or experience, but does consistently follow those most adaptive. In Litowitz-speak, it is not just IQ or EQ that matters, but AQ – adaptability quotient – a way of thinking that prioritizes learning over being right, and structure over rigidity. When the terrain shifts, do you update or insist?\n\nUpdating our prior – Chicago – with our data – Fisher – allows us to graduate with an extraordinarily valuable posterior because it contains X-marks-the-spot wisdom: markets overpay for stories of the future and underpay for hidden treasures of the past. That single Chicago-Fisherian insight caused us to make $3 billion in uncorrelated trading profits this year and $10 billion the last three. To see how, let’s go Bayesian treasure hunting and discover what awaits us buried in old reinsurance balance sheets and ancient Arkansas rock.\n\nIn 2023, amidst intense diligence for what ultimately became a $3 billion purchase of PDPsiii  in Arkansas’ Fayetteville Shale, we noticed that of the 860,000 acres included in the deal, 800,000 were covered with PDPs and 60,000 – all adjacent – were covered with grass. That’s a lot of undeveloped land.\n\n“Why are there no drilling rigs here?”\n\nWe decided to park our one major unanswered diligence question for the sake of efficiency, once convinced our PDP-only purchase could deliver our target returns.\n\nTwo years later, after taking over operations of the 5,596 wells we purchased – and our internally reframed responsibility of powering the homes of four million American families – the question resurfaced. “Why are there no rigs here?”\n\nThis time we could not shake it.\n\nWe learned that no one had drilled anything new for almost a decade, odd for a basin that size. A little stitious, we wondered, “Does treasure await?”\n\nWe suspected the previous owner’s “denominator problem” could explain their lack of drilling. They were an enormous company. Any marginal improvements in Fayetteville, despite being potentially large in dollar terms, would likely not move the needle in ROE, their north star.  In contrast, Stone Ridge operates every day with a “no basis point left behind” mindset. One basis point is our north star.  And, to us, large dollars will always be large dollars.\n\nWe also learned that two important aspects of drilling changed in the past decade: technologyiv and cost. Completion – the act of getting a drilled well to the point that gas steadily comes out of the ground for commercial purposes – now benefits from better drills, smarter rigs, more powerful fleets, and advanced digital control systems. And following a version of Moore’s Law, the new and better technology continually costs a lot less.\n\nWe decided to run a tightly controlled test program on our undeveloped land, drilling new wells, seeking fast, unbiased iterations, and updating – and hopefully tightening – the variance of our Bayesian prior – every day. Was there untapped gas under our 60,000 acres of grass? If so, where? If so, how much?\n\nOur approach was surgical. Two pads, five wells, disciplined design, unbiased data analysis, and adherence to the following mathematical identity.\n\nDrilling for natural gas ≡ searching for buried treasure in ancient rock\n\nThough we did not shout “today’s the day” every morning during our Fayetteville testing, we did feel Fisher-like energy as our ignorance shrank. Less wrong. Even less wrong. Absolutely right.\n\nEureka!  We found Fisher-like treasure.\n\nComposed of oil and gas, not gold and silver, our no-less-precious motherlode means that the $10 billion lifetime revenue we originally expected in Fayetteville now looks more like $15 billion. Discovering half an Atocha caused us to immediately shrink our priors in all seven U.S. basins we operate, a technical Bayesian statistical concept called “borrowing strength.” Our philosophy of probability theory, concretely applied to our Fayetteville test results, allowed us – with powerful practical efficiency – to know without knowing in the not-yet-tested basins. Less wrong.\n\nWe are now in the process of learning as much as is known about drilling before tapping our AQ to push the limit “a little further than others” and get closer to what is knowable. Every day counts because there’s gold oil and gas in them thar hills. It is waiting.\n\n“It may seem difficult at first, but all things are difficult at first.”\n\n— Miyamoto Musashi, The Book of Five Rings\n\nIn launching our energy franchise almost five years ago, we assumed our breakthroughs in proprietary financing and hedging technology – and the resulting material edge in our cost of funds – were sufficient conditions for best-in-class investment performance. We quickly and painfully learned, however, that financial sophistication cannot substitute for industrial control. In energy markets, physics – not finance – sets the tuition entrepreneurs must pay.\n\nA bit chastened, we updated our prior and then – fortuitously – met Flywheel Energy, by far the best operators in the industry, due in part to their entire executive team’s roots in elite military operations. Flywheel is now part of Stone Ridge.\n\nUnder Flywheel’s peerless leadership, and an unbeatable team of 794 superstars – including 569 in the field – we now operate our wells ourselves. With every colleague crisply aligned on, and unambiguously individually responsible for their specific part, maximizing a singular metric – total dollars of operating profit – physics and finance are now in sync. Industry-leading results have followed.\n\nSince inception, Stone Ridge Energy (SRE) has purchased almost $11 billion of energy assets, all via proprietary securitizations – no bankers, no information leakage, no fee leakage. Over that period, spot natural gas has traveled in a staggeringly wide and volatile range of $1.50/MMBtu to almost $9/MMBtu. Yet, across thirteen equity tranches, the integrated precision of Flywheel physics + Stone Ridge finance has produced >20%/year, with low volatility, and no correlation to anything.v\n\n“Never was a finer canvas presented to work on than our countrymen. All of them engaged in the pursuits of honest industry, independent in their circumstances, enlightened as to their rights, and firm in their habits of order.”\n\n— Thomas Jefferson in a letter to James Madison, 1796\n\nThe U.S. shale revolution required three actors, working in concert. First, unlimited underground supply of hydrocarbons. Second, technological breakthroughs to access it. Third, profit-seeking capital. Leveraging nature for the first part, SRE brings fresh thinking to the rest.\n\nPlay the tape forward five years and I do not see SRE as a larger version of what we are today. I see a different kind of company. SRE has a chance to matter in the same practical, civic way that a major rail line or a modern port matters. I would like us to.\n\nAt our pace of disciplined acquisitions, careful development, and unrelenting process improvement, SRE will be a top three U.S. producer of hydrocarbons. Managing that level of capital and molecule movement at our extraordinary level of operational excellence would meaningfully impact U.S. families, U.S. factories, and the competitiveness of this country. I would like us to.\n\nMore than 99% of the capital we manage at Stone Ridge, including SRE, comes from American investors. At our scale, that cannot happen by accident. At Stone Ridge, American capital produces American treasure.\n\nOn average and over time, treasure hunting in the sea is not a good business. Availability bias blinds us to the fact that for every Mel Fisher, dozens of others strike out. In fact, any too narrowly defined business is not a good business over a long enough time horizon.  Meta and abstract? No, Bayesian and practical. When the terrain shifts and you insist, your business surface area too is limited even for efficient Bayesian updating to help. In Litowitz-speak, your confirmation bias is fatal. It is just a matter of time.\n\nConsider legacy reinsurance. In contrast to prospective quota shares – aligned, partnership trades in which Stone Ridge shares risk pro rata with leading reinsurers, tapping into their masterful Bayesian updating cycle management skills across dozens of lines of business – legacy trades transfer retrospective risk from (re)insurance policies written years or decades ago.\n\nThe performance of legacy-only reinsurers is like that of lenders to too narrowly defined monoline credit originators (think: “only sub-prime auto” or “only UK small business”). Victims of confirmation bias’s siren song, monolines always – yes, always – originate unprofitable loans at the wrong time in the cycle.\n\nHealth warning: beware lending to monolines. When tight spreads persist, they insist.\n\nHealth warning: beware investing in legacy-only reinsurers. Confirmation bias dooms the business model and, along the way, guillotine-level adverse selection hangs over every trade. When a one-off risk-transfer price is highly attractive for clear and imperative strategic reasons, hyper-selective, non-legacy-only investors can profitably escape with their heads, but at Stone Ridge we know half-priced sushi does not mean it’s a bargain.\n\nA decade ago, there were about a dozen dedicated legacy firms and funds. Today, one large player remains, though recently its credibility detonated after initiating litigation against a client. The other remaining legacy-only firms are subscale or regionally focused. Enter Longtail Re.\n\nHumble beginnings, a clear vision\n\nStone Ridge began Longtail Re in 2020 focused on two simple ideas: 1) partner, not compete with the world’s best underwriters to generate a portfolio of hyper-diversified casualty liabilities that deliver low-cost float, and 2) invest that float in proprietary and valuable Stone Ridge-generated fixed income assets with superior risk-adjusted expected return.\n\nAlways open to Bayesian updating of its prior distribution core business model of prospective quota shares, Longtail Re’s positioning has always been: be available for new data and a reshaped posterior legacy transactions from motivated parties we know well and who call us, but do not be in the legacy business.\n\nOut of almost 100 legacy trade requests since inception, Longtail has written…three. Three.\n\nLongtail executed one of those three in November, a record $1.4 billion retrospective reinsurance transaction with Everest Group, an S&P 500 company, with whom Stone Ridge has an excellent, 13-year, uninterrupted trading relationship. Everest had compelling corporate reasons to de-risk, and the transaction with us, albeit enormous in the legacy space, was only one part of an even larger clear and imperative strategic repositioning of their entire firm. And of non-negotiable importance to us, we know (for many years), like, and trust Everest’s new CEO.\n\nThe trade has an outstanding expected return profile and diversifies Longtail’s core prospective portfolio because it covers past underwriting years back to 2003. It was also the largest legacy trade of Longtail CEO Mike Sapnar’s career, and mine.\n\nOn their most recent earnings call, Everest’s CEO said, “I was really, really glad that we were able to do this transaction with Longtail Re and Mike Sapnar...those are super credible underwriters. They did an excellent job evaluating the portfolio…it got to economics that will be very, very good for Longtail Re.” We agree.\n\nAs only Bayesian treasure hunting reinsurance geeks can, we internally renamed the core trade of the legacy reinsurance industry – a Loss Portfolio Transfer or LPT – to WPT. Waiting Portfolio Treasure.  Recall I said geeks. And who wants losses?\n\nLongtail ends 2025 with more than $6 billion in assets, about ⅓ from WPT, up from zero WPT 18 months ago.  Most important, Longtail has delivered 20% annualized ROE since inception in 2020, 16%/year higher than the average of the top three global reinsurers, our aspirational peer group in the decades ahead.\n\nLongtail may do its next legacy trade in two years, or five, or never. In recent pre-search research, we discovered a faded 1622 salvage account in Seville – aka PwC’s Annual Global Insurance Run-Off Survey – suggesting about $1 trillion of WPT may be out there, somewhere, buried in old reinsurance balance sheets. Our Bayesian training tells us about 97 out of 100 legacy treasure hunts would be for fool’s gold, but also that about $30 billion of real treasure awaits. I’m betting on Longtail’s Bayesian treasure hunters to find it.\n\nJust last year, The Atlantic wrote, “15 years into its existence, bitcoin has yet to demonstrate any serious use case.”vi\n\n87% of humans today – though definitely no one who edits articles at The Atlantic – were born into a monetary system without a reserve currency, and also without democracy, rule of law, or property rights. Simply put, the way The Atlantic editors use money is not the way most people on earth use money, whose savings technology is either collapsing paper notes, cattle, or sheet metal.\n\nSeething with financial privilege, The Atlantic editors might debate the relative merits of saving in NVDA vs. AMZN. How about, instead, cattle vs. sheet metal?\n\nIf bitcoin has no use case, perhaps The Atlantic editors should convert their entire life savings into Malawian Kwacha and see how it goes. In 2023, Malawi – generally considered a democratic country – chose a 44% overnight currency devaluation. And…it’s gone.vii If you don’t hold bitcoin, please step out of the line. This line is for people who have money. Not fiat credit.\n\nNo one got to vote on the inhuman cruelty of almost halving – overnight – the cumulative value of their entire life’s work. Instead, the criminal counterfeiters central bank forced The Atlantic editors 22 million humans to invest their life savings in unbacked pieces of paper with zero marginal production cost, turning them, ex-post, into 44% slaves. Nothing produced limitlessly and for free can ever, eventually, have value. Fiat is always and everywhere a ponzi phenomenon with seigniorage the State’s irresistibly silent Madoff-like pitch. Bitcoin, its kryptonite, will never take the meeting.\n\nStill no use case? Let’s try another one.\n\n“There isn’t a single goddamn thing that bitcoin can do for retail that Apple Pay doesn’t already do 10x better.”\n\n— The Atlantic editors bitcoin critic on Twitter (2019)\n\n“I CAN’T use Apple pay/PayPal/Visa/Master or anything like them.  \nI’m from Iran\nI CAN use bitcoin\nWhat do you have to say?!\"\n\n— Ziya Sadr, Iranian human rights activist subsequently jailed for freedom advocacy (recently released)\n\nThe critic issued a public apology.\n\nStill no use case? Before we try a final one, a Stoic parable about awe can provide some context:\n\nWhen we were very young, the world was an awe-inspiring place. Watch a three-year-old watch her dad fill up a castle-shaped bucket with wet sand at the beach. She is fascinated that her father would do such a thing, but when he inverts the bucket and carefully lifts it up – revealing a perfect sandcastle – the three-year-old is awestruck that such magic is possible and that her father has power to perform that magic.\n\nIf we meet that three-year-old ten years later, maybe she has 25% of the capacity for awe she had that day at the beach.\n\nAnd ten years after that, her capacity for awe might be down to 1% of its sandcastle level.viii\n\nIn one of the most moving days of my life, on December 10th in Oslo I got to attend the very intimate award ceremony for the Nobel Peace Prize. My battery capacity for awe recharged to 100%.\n\nMaría Corina Machado won for her decades-long commitment to freedom, democracy, and human dignity in Venezuela.  In 2023, with more than one-third of her country’s 30 million citizens having fled to survive – the largest refugee population in the world – Machado decided to run for President against the brutal dictator Maduro, her campaign the personification of ultimate bravery.\n\n“Traveling by road and dirt path across a country with gasoline shortages, daily blackouts, and collapsing communications,”ix  Machado risked her life just to campaign. On July 28, 2024, her supporters risked theirs just to vote. In a nationwide eruption of truth, Machado won in a landslide.x  The repressive Maduro regime ignored the results, clung to power illegally, and forced Machado into hiding.\n\nThey tried to bury us.\nThey didn’t know we were seeds.\n\nIn late 2024, from a secret location, Machado was interviewed by the Human Rights Foundation’s (HRF) Chief Strategy Officer, Alex Gladstein, saying,\n\n“The world knows of Chavez and Maduro's human rights abuses, but less about their violations of financial rights, turning a functional economy into a catastrophic financial crisis. In 2018, inflation reached 1.7 million percent. This financial repression rooted in state sponsored looting, theft, and money printing happened despite our vast natural resources.\n\nBeyond wrecking the currency, the regime weaponized financial systems against its people, freezing accounts, seizing assets, and cutting off services. Venezuelans found a lifeline in bitcoin during hyperinflation, using it to protect their wealth and to finance their escape. Today, bitcoin bypasses government-imposed exchange rates and thus helps many of our people. It has evolved from a humanitarian tool to a vital means of resistance. We are grateful for the lifeline bitcoin provides and look forward to embracing it in a new democratic Venezuela. We envision bitcoin becoming part of our national reserves, helping rebuild what the dictatorship stole. Before our gold reserves were plundered, Venezuela had wealthy financial reserves worldwide. We will restore those reserves and include bitcoin as a key component.\n\nUnlike bank wires, which the regime blocks, bitcoin donations cannot be seized. Let's use this technology to bring about the change Venezuela desperately needs.\n\nWe are determined to assert our sovereignty and transform Venezuela into an open, prosperous, and secure society, something that is only possible in a free nation.”\n\nWe await The Atlantic’s public apology.\n\nUpon news of her Nobel win, Machado began plotting her escape from hiding. She wanted to be in Oslo as a symbol for her people and the world. When it was time, Machado – in a wigged disguise and under the cover of dark – left her jungle hiding spot, evaded multiple regime checkpoints, took a tiny fishing boat through treacherous waters, and finally – miraculously – boarded a supporter’s private plane to make it to Oslo. It would be impossible to overstate the danger Machado faced to escape.\n\nAlmost immediately upon landing, at 3am local time – after hugging her family, or anyone, for the first time since she had gone into hiding 16 months earlier, and in the same clothes she began her now immensely historic day – Machado sat for an interview with BBC News.xi\n\nI immediately noticed she sounded different.\n\nAlready the world’s most inspirational living human rights activist, some transcendent combination of her time in hiding, winning the Nobel, and successful escape gave Machado’s tone, timbre, and bearing a Mandela-like ascendence and regality. She spoke with extraordinary moral authority and absolute certainty about future events, words coming through her with divine clarity, Machado now destined to become among the greatest female leaders of all time.\n\n“Venezuela has turned into a nation in which the state applies terrorism. The regime has control of all institutions and has applied state terrorism towards innocent people and committed crimes against humanity. And everybody that dares to speak out, to defend any of your basic rights, takes a huge risk and probably ends in prison. Just for posting news about the Nobel Prize, you will get in prison. And if they go looking for you and they don't find you in your house, they will take your family, even children in prison.\n\nSo, they had to say that I'm a terrorist, that I have to be in jail for the rest of my life, and they're looking for me. So, certainly, leaving Venezuela today in these circumstances is very, very dangerous. So, I just want to say today that I'm here, because many men and women risked their lives in order for me to arrive in Oslo. And I came here on behalf of them, and the millions of anonymous Venezuelan heroes to receive the prize and to take it back to them, because it's theirs.\n\nI'm going back to Venezuela. The Venezuelan government would have disappeared me if they found me when I was in Venezuela. And I know exactly the risks I'm taking. And what I've said to the Venezuelan people from the beginning is I'm going to be in the place where I am more useful for our cause. And until very short time ago, the place where I thought I had to be was Venezuela. The place where I believe I have to be today on behalf of our cause is Oslo.”\n\nIn his 1978 essay The Power of the Powerless, human rights activist Václav Havel – leader of the Velvet Revolution, first President of the post-Communist Czech Republic, and HRF’s first Chairman – makes the searing point that though authoritarians can mobilize their heavy artillery of terror, torture, imprisonment, and persecution, they are not equipped to fight the asymmetric battle between lies and truth.\n\nVenezuelan regime change can also be an asymmetric truth domino – the animating spark for revolutionary excitement, heroism, and power among the powerless – that then topples the other nearby dictators in Cuba and Nicaragua. That cumulative outcome would be of immense significance to America, and that possibility has been hugely motivational to me. For American global primacy to continue, which it must, this must be the Western Hemisphere’s century. No authoritarians allowed in the neighborhood.\n\nThe majority of my personal philanthropy is anonymous, and it will stay that way. However, in the hope of inspiring followershipxii  at this moment of maximum human rights gamma, I will share that I have long supported Alex Gladstein’s work arming the only people dictators fear – human rights activists – with large quantities of Satoshi’s unstoppable truth-telling weapon. Bitcoin is money dictators can’t stop. I know firsthand its importance to HRF.\n\nAsleep during Machado’s BBC News interview, I left Oslo a few hours later, hustling back to New York to host the Stone Ridge holiday party that evening. After landing, I saw, and then listened to, a voicenote attached to an encrypted message. Mouth agape, I recognized the voice immediately. With an ascendence and regality that moved me to tears by the end, here is the message in full:\n\nI want to thank you personally for your support of the Human Rights Foundation and all the programs that have made possible this unique moment in Oslo this week.\n\nBecause of your support I was able to move, to arrive where I needed to be and to continue to fight without interruption. You know in moments like these, logistics are the whole difference between presence and absence.\n\nI arrived late and I didn’t have a chance to thank you in person as I wanted, or to tell you about the plans we have in the time to come, but I know that we will have a chance to do that very soon. I want you to know that your personal commitment to our struggle for freedom translates directly into action.\n\nIt gives our people and people like us the ability to stand where it matters and when it matters so I am very, very grateful for your clarity of purpose, for your belief in freedom and certainly for your willingness to stand for this freedom in both practice and principle.\n\nI will not cease in this struggle for freedom, and I certainly look forward to welcoming you and hosting you and your family in our beautiful country and a free Venezuela.\n\nThank you for making so much happen. I look forward to seeing you and please take very good care.”\n\nBitcoin has a use case.  Human rights treasure.\n\nAnd with Machado walking among us, we need not live life devoid of feelings of awe.\n\nIn 1984 Apple, then still Apple Computer, premiered a sci-fi short film – a commercial at the Super Bowl – in which a rebellious heroine smashes a screen, symbolizing Apple breaking free from the conformity of IBM’s Big Brother. Widely considered the greatest commercial of all-time for almost four decades, it established Apple’s identity, paved the way for the Mac, and led to record sales.\n\nIn 2020, also at the Super Bowl, Apple was dethroned. New York Life premiered an even better commercial paving the way for the next chapter of its identity, also leading to record sales. Over the course of 60 emotional seconds, New York Life began by briefly exploring three Greek words for love (Philia, Storgē, Eros) to then focus on the fourth, Agape, or love as an action. The ad contained powerful scenes of care, including a ten-year-old boy lifting his little brother over a country fence en route to adventure, and a 50-year-old son lowering his frail 95-year-old father into a tub to help him bathe. The commercial anchored the firm’s 175th anniversary branding of building better futures through love and financial security.\n\nThe ancient Greeks had four words for love. The first is Philia. Philia is affection that grows from friendship. Next there’s Storgē, the kind you have for a grandparent. Or a brother. Third, there’s Eros, the uncontrollable urge to say, “I love you.” The fourth kind of love is different. It’s the most admirable. It’s called Agape: love as an action. It takes courage, sacrifice, strength; for 175 years we’ve been helping people act on their love so they can look back – or ahead – and say, “We got it right. We did good.”\n\nStone Ridge takes immense pride in working for the policyholders of New York Life, and also MassMutual, iconic American firms and our largest partners, 180-years-old and 174-years-old, respectively. Mutuals are special. They feel different inside. There is no conflict of interest between the shareholders and the policyholders because there are no shareholders. The policyholders own the firm, a wonderfully clarifying and palpable distinction. Employees stay for decades, and the top executives view themselves, appropriately and inspirationally to me, as leaders and stewards. My Stone Ridge colleagues and I run to work every day for New York Life and MassMutual. And we aspire for our little firm to be like those big guys when we grow up.\n\nSince any company’s longevity, on a long enough timescale, is entirely dependent on its ability to reinvent itself, the most underappreciated characteristic of these mutuals is their astonishing consistency of innovation. The typical firm in the S&P 500 is 58 years old, not 180. No business can do tomorrow what it did yesterday and last very long, let alone do in the next century what it did in the last.\n\nConsider that these mutuals paid claims during the Civil War when – remember, their core product is life insurance – their policyholders were shooting each other. They paid claims after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, decades before Hannover Re-quality earthquake seismologists could help them properly underwrite that risk. And they paid claims through the two global pandemics, twice surviving life insurers’ one true tail risk.\n\nExtraordinary financial strength, ironclad reliable claims payment, and a monumentally underrated culture of innovation = New York Life and MassMutual.\n\nWatching these reinventing mutuals up close has also taught me that firms seeking longevity – including Stone Ridge – must, just as importantly, decide what must not change. What is our air-gapped mission? What are the rituals we dare not cease?  What routines – the ones that make us us – shall we pass to new colleagues? In essence, what are we stewards of?\n\n“In order to be irreplaceable, one must always be different.”\n\n— Coco Chanel, revolutionary fashion designer\n\nAt Stone Ridge, we innovate to prepare for an uncertain future, in pursuit of our mission: financial security for all. Our rituals are few, important, and sacrosanct. Our routines drive our productivity.\n\nWe work five days/week in office and have a “no-device” policy in meetings, routines that maximize exposure to the uncorrelated weirdness of our spectacular coleagues. Fiddling with a device in a meeting means you do not belong in that meeting. Meetings should be rare, riveting, and short. Zero is the wrong number of meetings for a firm, but it is close. A meeting-less firm with 100 employees has 4,950 potential 1:1 colleague-collisions all day long. Remove 10% of the team for an unnecessary meeting and lose 945 potential collisions. That meeting-math is especially punishing at Stone Ridge. Our people are our moat, dug deeper per collision.\n\n“A lot of people never use their initiative because no one told them to.”\n\nInitiating collisions with insanely smart colleagues at Stone Ridge can seem intimidating at first, but you must take the initiative to ever create a map in which X marks the spot. My advice to my colleagues is the same advice I give to my 18- and 23-year-old boys.  Ask her out. Whether “she” is a hard class, a job, a city, a beautiful woman, or a brilliant Stone Ridge colleague – just go up and talk.xiv And remember, Stone Ridge colleagues are insanely kind too.\n\nAt Stone Ridge, we care deeply about how we present ourselves to outsiders because we matter, and so do they. When introducing ourselves in meetings, we mention our role and how long we have been at the firm. “Hi, I’m Ross Stevens, the CEO, and I’ve been at Stone Ridge since 2012.” After meetings, we walk our guests to the elevator, along the way sincerely thanking them for the visit. Sometimes we even take the elevator down with them so we can thank them some more. Finally, business cards are back. Business cards remind us we live in a tactile world, and our most tactile experiences are with other humans. Business cards also symbolize something of value – you. Our simple meeting routines honor ourselves and our firm and show proper respect to our visitors.\n\n“Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.”\n\nOver the last 36 months, three Stone Ridge colleagues voluntarily left to work at another firm. Each was junior in their career and had a ten-month average tenure with us. Clearly, Stone Ridge was not for them. We, in turn, reflected on what happened in each instance and refined our recruiting process, uninterested in transience in any element of our life’s work. Though Stone Ridge achieved, with plenty of room to spare, my singular KPI – less than 1%/year voluntary turnover – those three departures were exactly three too many to me. I intend to raise my game in 2026, so please tune in – same Bat-Time, same Bat-Channel – to see if I had a better year.\n\n“I need someone to protect me from all the measures they take in order to protect me.”\n\nDespite the three leavers, Stone Ridge got something very important, very right at firm inception: no HR. No HR is the gift that keeps on giving because the very best people are repelled by those addicted to comfort. When new folks arrive at Stone Ridge and realize we have no HR, a lens cap lifts off their consciousness. Surrounded by elite intellectual athletes, they immediately begin their training to be one, feeling compelled to do remarkable things, utterly untethered to what they previously thought possible. We teach them business physics, but also to feel bound by nothing. I would not dare limit their leaps even one inch with even one minute of an infantilizing HR training session.\n\n“He is no longer a dreamer.  He is a creator.”\n\n— Sculptor Auguste Rodin, describing his masterpiece The Thinker\n\nOne of my favorite untethered Stone Ridge policies is unlimited maternity leave, which has been true since the firm began. I think of Agape. It takes care and action to properly delegate your duties to your remaining colleagues while you enjoy that magical time with your family. In action and a bit of love, your colleagues lock arms and step up for you, so the firm does not miss a beat in your absence, the duration of which I refuse to meter. It also takes action and a bit of love to take no action. The awesome women of Stone Ridge know their job will be waiting for them when they get back. I sometimes wonder if that ever helps them decide to create more treasure.\n\n“It is fun to have fun, but you have to know how.”\n\n— Philosopher The Cat, on his approach to work in his masterpiece The Cat in the Hat\n\nAt Stone Ridge, we relentlessly focus on growing after-tax cash flow to drive durable equity value in our operating businesses. Our progress has never resembled a straight line up and to the right, and I hope it never does. However, thinking deeply about what we know before we know, open-mindedness to – and hunger for – new data, and extremely rapid posterior updating – and ultimately the courage to create with conviction when we believe it is time – have been the hallmarks of our operating model since firm inception.\n\nThe first rule of product design at Stone Ridge is we build products we want for ourselves. Stone Ridge is always the seed investor and, whenever possible – but not yet always – the largest. Consider our “no-device” policy in this context. Would you ever pull out your phone and start scrolling in the middle of a meeting with your largest investor? At Stone Ridge, we do not pull our phones out on each other.\n\nWith Stone Ridge increasingly Stone Ridge’s largest investor, the scale of our profits as principals, not agents, creates a level of alignment with our outside investors we are unaware exists elsewhere. Those investors occasionally remark that this is a wonderfully clarifying and palpable distinction, and that Stone Ridge feels different inside.\n\nEarlier this year, Stone Ridge Holdings Group (SRHG), parent company of Stone Ridge Asset Management, NYDIG, and Longtail Re, completed a significant primary equity financing led by an iconic American financial services firm – also a mutual, though this one a relatively spry 165-year-old – we are thrilled to partner with in the decades ahead.\n\nDespite regularly rising profitability, regularly raising primary equity for our parent and affiliates – $4.6 billion and counting, and only primary, ever – has been our quiet way of strengthening our most important partnerships, playing muscular defense when the sky falls in our markets, and playing profitable post-event offense in the aftermath.\n\nFounding 2012 SRHG investors have received 32x their original investment in distributions and now own equity valued up 178x net of those distributions, an annualized total return of 50%.  Fisher took 5,954 days to find the Atocha. We have been at it for 4,930. Every morning, I bang our little ship’s pots and pans with a smile because I know Stone Ridge will find the treasure.\n\nAs we enter 2026, our tanks are filled with energy, gratitude, and inspiration. We innovate to prepare for an uncertain future, in pursuit of our mission: financial security for all.\n\nStone Ridge is most proud of the partnership we have with you, our investors. We are on the path together. You contribute the capital to propel and sustain groundbreaking product development. We contribute our collective careers’ worth of experience in sourcing, structuring, execution, and risk management. Together, it works. In that spirit, I offer my deepest gratitude to you for sharing your wealth with us this year. We look forward to serving you again in 2026.",

    "fullText": "From Zendaya to zoomers, listeners are forgoing the convenience of wireless headphones to plug in again. Is it just a retro affectation – or does this physical connection strengthen our relationship to music?\n\nAirPods changed my life. I was previously a user of excellent but somewhat cumbersome Audio Technica over-ears, but Apple’s wireless headphones – dinky in their construction, finicky in their setup, temperamental in their ability to actually work – liberated me from cords. My listening habits are, at best, frustrating for the people around me: when you write about music, you have to listen to the same things over and over, and sometimes those things are very bad. Suddenly I could listen to a terrible new pop record or an ominous drone piece while making breakfast or folding laundry late at night without fear of disturbing my housemates by listening from a speaker. I kept my Audio Technicas but built out my collection of AirPods; now I use the wireless in-ear ones while commuting and also have the over-ear AirPods Max.\n\nFor a while, though, I’ve been thinking about moving back to wired earbuds. At some point, doubts about the joyous wireless future I was living in began to creep into my head. I am conspiracy-prone, and started to wonder what all that Bluetooth was doing to my head. I thought about the security issues that come with Bluetooth. And after a fall from a Lime bike on a slippery road, I started thinking about ways to avoid all future falls, one of which was to cycle without listening to music or podcasts.\n\nMost of all, I wondered whether my ability to listen to music constantly was making me value it less. When you have to listen to music occupationally, your standards necessarily get higher – a lot of music really is quite samey – but is my ability to listen on my minute-long walk to check the mail really beneficial, or is it simply turning art into ambient noise? And that is to say nothing of the way wireless headphones seem to turn communal spaces such as cafes and sidewalks into thoroughfares for individuals. These problems theoretically exist for users of wired headphones too, but I can’t say I ever considered headphones antisocial or anti-art until AirPods came along.\n\nI’m clearly not the only one. I see more and more people, especially people around my age, rocking the classic white iPod-associated earbuds instead of the previously ubiquitous AirPods. Celebrities and politicians such as Bella Hadid, Zendaya, Dua Lipa and Kamala Harris use them, as do a lot of musicians I know. When New York magazine published its annual Reasons to Love New York issue last week, it featured stars such as Debbie Harry, Cameron Winter and Subway Takes host Kareem Rahma sharing wired earbuds on the cover, because photographer Hannah la Follette Ryan had noticed more and more people listening to music that way on the subway. You see the same casual intimacy on the tube in London and on buses. The other day I even saw a teenager recreating the ultimate symbol of cool of my youth: two white earbuds dangling from the inside of his collar.\n\nAlthough there is undeniably some swaggy retro appeal in wearing wired headphones – especially dinky white ones, which allow Gorillaz-loving zoomers, of whom there are many, to relive the era of the Feel Good Inc-soundtracked iPod ad – I think the return to cords was likely born out of a desire for simplicity and economy. The facts of being young right now – just of being alive right now – are that wages have stagnated as prices have gotten higher and rent has become exorbitant. AirPods cost £99, wired Apple headphones are £17: the moment you lose an AirPod – or, as once happened to me, drop one as you leave a bus and look on in horror as the bus slowly rolls over it – you realise that they are emphatically a luxury product, not the everyday essential they may have seemed when you were using them to tune out a rowdy toddler on said bus. As with streaming, or TikTok, or next-day delivery, luxuries we’ve had access to for only a few years can seem indispensable when there’s actually evidence to suggest the world functioned a whole lot better before we had all these things.\n\nThat wired headphones are experiencing a resurgence is heartening – it may be a bellwether for a society ready and willing to slowly divest from all the crutches it uses every day. (I hope ChatGPT is next.) On the other hand, it could mean nothing except that 18-year-olds have just discovered the aura-increasing capabilities of white rubber-coated wire and PVC. Either way, I am ready for our corded future. When I go Christmas shopping this week, I certainly know what Shaad is getting.",

    "fullText": "Mass protests have erupted across Iran calling for “death to the dictator” over the regime’s economic crisis.\n\nTear gas was used to disperse protesters as shops shuttered in Tehran’s Grand Bazaar and main markets.\n\nUniversity students called on their peers to join the demonstrations, while chants echoed from rooftops in several cities and the Iranian rial plunged to record lows, all against the backdrop of ongoing threats from Israel and the US.\n\nResidents in one city near Tehran told The Telegraph that a heavy presence of armed motorcycle-mounted security forces was visible around midnight.\n\nOn Monday, security forces fired tear gas to disperse protesters in Tehran while residents in Malard, 28 miles east of the capital, were faced with motorcycle-mounted armed security.\n\nIn several cities, people went on to their rooftops and chanted slogans against the Islamic Republic and Ali Khamenei, its supreme leader.\n\nThe protests have been cheered on by Israel, whose foreign ministry hoping for Mr Khamenei’s overthrow welcomed the action with “open arms”.\n\nDonald Trump also threatened military action on Monday if Iran rebuilds its nuclear or missile programmes, warning he will “knock the hell out of them”.\n\nAt several universities, students urged their peers to join demonstrations after protests erupted at Tehran University’s dormitory complex.\n\nSecurity forces surrounded the dormitory on Monday evening and closed its gates with a heavy security presence around the campus.\n\nStudents living at the complex chanted slogans including “Woman, life, freedom”, “Students die but do not accept humiliation” and “Be afraid, be afraid, we are all together”.\n\nOne student inside the dormitory said: “They have closed the gates, and special forces on motorcycles are circling us. We are determined – some of us may be arrested, things could get worse – but we will not back down.”\n\nIranian universities have long been hubs of political activism, with students playing key roles in protests for decades.\n\nAhmadreza, a university student in Malard, told The Telegraph: “They [the protesters] have closed roads in several neighbourhoods, and chants are coming from all directions. People are also chanting from their rooftops.\n\n“It’s almost impossible to move from one part of the city to another. There are police cars with cages. People are angry and exhausted as prices rise day by day.”\n\nThe protests began on Sunday afternoon after mobile phone and electronics shopkeepers in Tehran shut their stores as the rial currency fell to a record low of 1.42 million to the dollar.\n\nRiot police in full gear confronted hundreds of demonstrators near Tehran’s Grand Bazaar and in the Saadi Street area on Monday afternoon.\n\nTraders shut their shops and urged others to join the closures. Security forces maintained a heavy presence at multiple locations throughout the capital.\n\nThe currency recovered slightly to 1.38 million on Monday evening after the Islamic Republic’s central bank governor resigned but remains down approximately 40 per cent since June.\n\nIran’s currency collapse is compounding severe inflation. The state statistics centre reported inflation reached 42.2 per cent in December, up 1.8 percentage points from November.\n\nFood prices surged 72 per cent, and health and medical items rose 50 per cent compared to the same period last year.\n\nMasoud Pezeshkian, Iran’s president, said on Sunday in the parliament: “I have no motivation to remain in government or to remain president if I cannot solve the problems of the people and the deprived.\n\n“This is not something I want to be proud of. We cannot govern while people have problems … they say salaries are low, so they are low, they say you are taking too much in taxes, so we are taking too much tax.\n\n“On the other side, they say increase salaries. Someone tell me where I should get the money from to give?”\n\nMr Pezeshkian addressed the protests directly on Monday night after the demonstrations spread, saying he will listen to the protesters’ demands.\n\nHe said: “We have fundamental measures on the agenda to reform the monetary and banking system and preserve people’s purchasing power.\n\n“I have tasked the interior minister to listen to the rightful demands of the protesters through dialogue with their representatives, so that the government can act with full effort to resolve problems and respond responsibly.”\n\nThe rial was trading at 32,000 to the dollar in 2015 when Iran signed a nuclear accord with world powers that lifted international sanctions.\n\nThat agreement collapsed after Mr Trump withdrew the United States from it in 2018.\n\nThe deal completely collapsed in October and followed by the reimposition of UN sanctions that were lifted as part of the deal.\n\nIran last experienced nationwide protests in 2022 and 2023 after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody.\n\nHundreds of people were killed, more than 20,000 arrested, and several executed in connection with those demonstrations.\n\nState media acknowledged Monday’s protests but said that shopkeepers were concerned only about economic conditions.\n\nState media reporters on the main 20:30 news programme sought to portray the protests as economic rather than anti-regime, showing scenes of normality on the streets and interviewing residents.\n\nOne resident said: “Please end this – end this. The price of the dollar is nonsense.”\n\nAnother shopkeeper said: “If we sell something today, we can’t buy it again at the same price tomorrow. The government should think about the situation.”\n\nThe government’s IRNA news agency reported that mobile phone vendors were reacting to business threats from the currency’s depreciation.\n\nIran also raised petrol prices this month, triggering warnings from lawmakers about a potential repeat of violent 2019 fuel protests that killed hundreds in what was then the deadliest unrest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.\n\nMostafa Tajzadeh, the imprisoned Iranian politician and prominent dissident, said: “Now the time has come for all those who want a prosperous, free, and independent Iran to speak with one voice and call for the separation of religious institutions from political institutions, for the clergy to hand power back to the people, and to return to their traditional base in the seminaries.\n\n“The safest and most reliable way out of the crises is to convene a constituent assembly and amend the constitution in line with the will of the nation.”\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "description": "Researchers remain stumped.",
    "fullText": "Researchers have found wolves engaging in rudimentary tool use, according to PetaPixel.\n\nTrail camera footage has captured wolves pulling crab traps out of the water to eat the bait inside. Members of the Heiltsuk First Nation have been attempting to capture invasive European green crabs near Bella Bella, British Columbia. Their traps were being routinely found ripped open, so researchers set up cameras.\n\nThere's some debate as to whether this counts as actual tool use since the wolves didn't put out the traps themselves. But it is still a remarkable sign of wildlife intelligence.\n\n\"Even if we don't want to call it tool use, the fact that the trap was completely underwater and out of sight makes it hard to argue that she didn't understand the connection between all these steps,\" said report author Kyle Artelle, per The New York Times. \"This wasn't just random tinkering.\"\n\nWhile interesting, this situation shows how humans introducing food incentives to areas can warp natural feeding habits. The erosion of habitat can diminish feeding opportunities for wildlife, forcing it to scour farther afield to survive. This can lead to animals roaming areas populated by people.\n\nWolves are vital parts of Canada's ecosystems. As apex predators, they help keep prey species populations in check, which ensures that plant species aren't overgrazed. Wolf populations have been in decline in some areas of the Pacific Northwest despite management efforts.\n\nThat said, wolf interference with attempts to remove European green crabs may further harm local ecosystems. When invasive species take over, they monopolize vital resources like food, water, and space, causing a local decline in biodiversity.\n\nEuropean green crabs pose a threat to salmon, clams, and other crab species that fishery industries rely upon. Some jurisdictions have had to make concerted removal efforts. These include initiatives to eat more of the invasive species.\n\nTrail cameras have proven vital in detecting emerging behaviors from elusive and remote wildlife like wolves in this situation. Armed with new information, conservation efforts can be appropriately adjusted. That said, researchers remain stumped as to why or how the wolves figured out how to exploit crab traps for food.\n\n\"We ultimately don't know, but [one of the] most likely explanations in our minds … would be that the wolves started doing this with traps that were exposed at a low tide because that's really easy,\" Artelle said to the CBC.\n\nDo you think we still have a lot to learn from ancient cultures?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Known as a kore, this 2,500 year-old-statue is a fusion of ancient aesthetics and a symbol of cultural exchange between the Greeks and the Etruscans.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nRecent excavations in the ancient Etruscan city of Vulci revealed the head of a marble statue that appears to have Greek influence.\n\nThe head belongs to a kore, statues made in the images of young women which stood in and around the temples of Greece at the time.\n\nThought to have been associated with a temple in Vulci, this artifact is a rare glimpse at larger Etruscan objects inspired by cultural exchange with the Greeks of Attica.\n\nAt an archaeological site in what used to be the ancient Etruscan city of Vulci, the disembodied head of a young woman began to emerge from the ground, her empty eyes staring through millennia of history. Her marble face had not seen daylight in 2,500 years.\n\nBefore the rise of the Roman Empire, the Etruscan civilization flourished in the western region of central Italy once known as Etruria. Vulci was situated northwest of Rome in what is now the province of Viterbo. As directors of the Vulci Cityscape project, archaeologists Mariachiara Franceschini of the Albert Ludwig University of Freiburg and Pau Pasieka of Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz were excavating the ruins of this once prosperous ancient metropolis. It was there that they came upon the marble head of a statue mirroring the Greek korai found near the Parthenon in the Athenian Acropolis. It was a rare glimpse into a larger sculpture that shows the extent of Greek influence on Etruscan art and culture.\n\nThe face of the nameless woman most likely gazed out from a monumental temple that was discovered in 2020 near Tempio Grande. She had once had a decorative and possibly ritual purpose. With an eerily lifelike smile, she wears a diadem over a crown of hair that has been meticulously carved down to every strand, and while the paint that once brought her to life has long since eroded, she was preserved so well that traces of original paint can still be seen on the marble. While it used to be thought that most of the cultural exchange between Etruria and the Attica region of Greece (also famous for its honey) was evidenced in the form of painted pottery, the head of this kore shows that Hellenic influence reached beyond clay vessels.\n\nWhoever commissioned this statue must have been one of the Etruscan elite. Marble was an expensive material usually reserved for the religious or funerary art of the upper classes, and the quality of the craftsmanship can still be seen thousands of years later. This level of detail extends to the texture of the kore’s hair—its flowing waves are reminiscent of similar Hellenic statues. She is one of the few pieces in this style found outside of Greece. Most previous Etruscan excavations have focused on tombs and necropolis complexes without much investigation of everyday urban life. Unlike the broken columns of ancient Greek and Roman cities that are still standing, no buildings survive in that area. Only their foundations remain.\n\nThis kore is now being restored at Rome’s Instituto Centrale per il Restauro. Though it is not certain whether she was made for the temple she is now being associated with, that temple rose between the end of the sixth and the beginning of the fifth century B.C.E. It was also built the same time as another temple that was excavated during the 1950s and dated based on artifacts that were unearthed around its foundations. Crumbling sections of wall made of volcanic rock gave more insight into how the architecture of Vulci evolved over a thousand years of serving as the heart of Etruscan society.\n\n“We discovered remains from the city’s origins that had previously been overlooked in Vulci and are now better able to understand the dynamics of settlement and the road system, besides identifying different functional areas in the city,” Pasieka said in a press release about the discovery of the temple.\n\nAnother impressive Etruscan object with Hellenized features is a massive bronze lamp whose symbolism was a mystery for decades. Its images of forest nymphs and satyrs were finally determined to be revelers of Dionysus, the Greek deity of wine, fertility, ecstasy, mysticism and theatre, who appears as a horned god in ornamental figures that surround them.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "HOLBROOK, Ariz. (AP) — Investigators declined to reveal the suspected motive in the shooting death of a prominent California farmer’s estranged wife in eastern Arizona, but they said the couple's prolonged divorce case arose in nearly all interviews with family and friends.\n\nMichael Abatti, 63, was arrested last week in El Centro, California, in the shooting death of Kerri Ann Abatti, 59, at her family’s vacation home in Pinetop, Arizona, where she moved after splitting with her husband.\n\nInvestigators, who discussed the case at a news conference Monday, say Michael Abatti traveled from El Centro to Pinetop on Nov. 20, carried out the killing and returned to California early the next morning. They declined to say what occurred at the Pinetop house in the last days of Kerri Abatti’s life.\n\n“Different theories will come up,” Navajo County Sheriff David Clouse said of the motive. “The only thing that’s glaring that I think everybody already knows is there’s a divorce in place and they weren’t able to come to a resolution. But I can’t speak exactly to what the motive would be.”\n\nOwen Roth, one of Michael Abatti’s attorneys, said his client surrendered to law enforcement, agreed to be extradited to Arizona and remains innocent under the law. “Our client is in his mid-60s and has significant health issues, and we continue to worry about his well-being,” Roth said. “We ask the public to respect his privacy and constitutional rights and reiterate that this case will be decided based on the evidence by a jury.” An autopsy report released Monday said Kerri Abatti’s cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head.\n\nThe report said she was found unconscious on the floor near her kitchen by her nephew, who told investigators he heard a loud sound before finding her. When investigators searched the home they found a “circular defect” on a window and determined “a gunshot likely originated from the yard outside the home,” the autopsy report said.\n\nThe Associated Press left a message for the Navajo County Sheriff’s Office for further explanation. The medical examiner’s office in Coconino County, which conducted the autopsy, directed questions about the report to a Navajo County official, and the AP also left a message for the official. A descendant of early Latter-day Saints settlers who helped found Pinetop in the 1880s, Kerri had filed for divorce, with proceedings pending in California at the time of her death.\n\nAuthorities searched his home in far Southern California on Dec. 2 as part of the investigation into his wife’s death.\n\nMichael Abatti comes from a long line of farmers in the crop-rich Imperial Valley, which is the biggest user of Colorado River water and known for growing leafy greens, melons and forage crops. His grandfather, an Italian immigrant, was among the region’s early settlers and his father helped start the Imperial Valley Vegetable Growers Association.\n\nMichael Abatti served on the board of the powerful Imperial Irrigation District from 2006 to 2010.\n\nThe Abattis, who married in 1992 and had three children, were sparring over finances. Kerri told the court the couple had lived an affluent lifestyle during more than three decades of marriage. They owned property in three states, vacationed internationally and sent their children to private school.\n\nKerri initially received $5,000 monthly temporary spousal support. She later sought an increase, citing struggles to maintain her standard of living as well as keep up the Arizona property. She also asked for an additional $100,000 in attorney’s fees, court filings showed.\n\nMichael Abatti eventually agreed to raise support to $6,400 monthly, despite having countered in a court filing that poor farming years had reduced his income. He blamed market shifts favoring Ukrainian crops, rising shipping costs and harsh weather.",

    "description": "Why the old formula is no longer holding up.",
    "fullText": "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nFor decades, the classic 60/40 portfolio — 60% stocks and 40% bonds — served as the cornerstone of balanced investing. The idea was simple: When stocks stumbled, bonds would steady the ship.\n\nBut according to economist Peter Schiff, that old formula no longer holds up. Inflation, he warns, has torn apart one side of the traditional mix, leaving investors exposed to painful consequences.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nApproaching retirement with no savings? Don’t panic, you're not alone. Here are 6 easy ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\n“Bonds are clearly the biggest victims of inflation. If you own bonds, inflation kills you. There is no hedge,” Schiff said in a YouTube video from October 2025 (1).\n\nBut, on Dec. 22, Wells Fargo reported that the yield on 10-year bonds increased 0.03% while 30-year bonds saw a 0.02% uptick (2). This follows the BLS reporting lower inflation rates than expected on Dec. 18, in their first report on the Consumer Price Index since the government shutdown in October and November (3).\n\nBonds are particularly vulnerable when price levels rise. Their fixed payments don’t adjust for inflation, meaning investors are repaid in dollars that buy less and less over time.\n\nMeanwhile, higher inflation often pushes interest rates up — and as rates rise, the market value of existing bonds falls because new issues offer better yields. That double blow — shrinking purchasing power and falling prices — can leave existing bondholders with real losses even as they collect “safe” interest payments.\n\nThat’s a serious concern because bonds remain a core holding in many Americans’ portfolios, especially retirement accounts. For retirees and near-retirees counting on those holdings to preserve purchasing power, inflation can quietly erode wealth — even when markets appear calm. If inflation spikes again, many Americans could see their portfolios become compromised.\n\nTo address that problem, a major Wall Street firm is giving the traditional 60/40 mix a modern upgrade.\n\nSchiff pointed out that Morgan Stanley is leading the rethink. Instead of 60% stocks and 40% bonds, Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson now favors 60% stocks, 20% fixed income and 20% gold.",

    "fullText": "\"Then, about two months before my diagnosis, I started experiencing severe lower back pain and pelvic cramps. That is what ultimately led me to my ob-gyn. It was a tricky diagnosis. Even a biopsy did not indicate cancer, but the doctor decided to perform a D&C as an extra measure, and that is how the cancer was found. Surgery and radiation were the treatment plans. That was three years ago. I just had a PET SCAN, which showed I am now cancer-free, but I remain under surveillance for two more years.\"\n\n\"'Before I tell him to quit, I'd like to get your opinion,' she said. 'Let’s go into the bathroom. I want to show you something.'\n\nThis wasn't something I expected or anticipated. She lowered her pants and had me look just above her buttocks. There was a three-inch growth that resembled a worm. It was large, thick, and angry-looking.\n\n'Don't let him quit his job yet,' I said. 'You need a doctor first. Do it while you still have insurance.'\n\n'That's way above my pay grade,' I said. I'm not medical in any way, shape, or form.'\n\nThe next week, she saw her primary care doctor, who turned her over to a specialist, which kind, I don't know.\n\n'Thanks for telling me to see the doctor,' she said. 'He’s going to hang in until we get to the bottom of this.'\n\nMy friend had anal cancer. Because she wanted to handle her healing herself, she went with a natural approach and ate only things with no mothers and no faces and watched only old screwball comedies on TV. In three years, she went from an 85% survival rate to terminal. By the time she went back to a 'normal’ doctor, she was inoperable and in tremendous pain. Hospice wouldn't provide her with enough pain medication to control her pain. It was a horrible death.\n\nIn a nutshell, noticing something unusual needs to be investigated. Only you really know your body; keep looking for answers.\"\n\n\"Today, I'm a six-year ovarian cancer survivor because it was detected early, aggressive treatment was started immediately, and I had the support of my family and an incredible medical team. (My oncologist is Dr. Hope! Isn't that the best possible name?)\"\n\n\"Five years later, I had another diagnosis of cancer, but it was caught early, and it was stage one. I didn't feel that one — it was found on a mammogram. But months before, I felt extremely tired and had trouble staying awake during the day. I always wondered if that was a sign that something wasn't right with my body. The tiredness got better once my treatments were finished. Who knows. I am blessed to be here still, though!\"\n\n\"The strange part was that despite not being treated for the duration of my cancer treatment, the fungus infection healed up all by itself. That fungal infection was the only indication that I had a serious problem.\"\n\n\"December 2023 UPDATE: One year has passed. I had six months (12 infusions) of hard chemotherapy, and as of the end of September 2023, I was told that the cancer was in remission.\"\n\n\"But, four years after that cancer, I was diagnosed with very early ovarian cancer. It turns out colon/ovarian/ breast are related in some people. That cancer had no symptoms. It was found because I knew the connection between the three cancers and did aggressive follow-up. The doctor spotted an ovarian tumor so small that it couldn't be felt if he were to examine the ovary. Turns out my peritoneum was loaded with tiny tumors. Lesson: colon cancer w/symptoms saved my life. I never would have found the ovarian if I hadn't been doing serious follow-up. That cancer was 17 years ago.\"\n\nSome entries have been edited for length and/or clarity.\n\nAlso in Internet Finds: \"I Genuinely Believe She Saved My Life\": People Are Revealing The \"Shockingly Nice\" Things Strangers Have Done For Them That They'll Always Remember, And I'm Sitting Here In A Puddle Of Happy Tears\n\nAlso in Internet Finds: 19 People Are Sharing Eerie, Unexplainable Moments From Their Lives That Will 99.999% Make A Shiver Run Up Your Spine\n\nAlso in Internet Finds: 17 Actual Texting Conversations People Had With Potential Partners That'll Straight Up Put You Out",

(AP) — A Georgia judge on Monday ordered a temporary pause to a December execution that was already put on hold, saying questions about the state's clemency process must be addressed before Stacey Humphreys ' death sentence could be carried out.\n\nHumphreys, 52, was facing scheduled execution Dec. 17 but the procedure was paused just days before he was to have received a lethal injection.\n\nHe was convicted of malice murder and other crimes in the 2003 shooting deaths of Cyndi Williams, 33, and Lori Brown, 21, at the real estate office where they worked in Cobb County, northwest of Atlanta.\n\nAt issue: Humphreys' lawyers contend that two members of Georgia's parole board have conflicts of interest which would taint their participation in a clemency hearing.\n\nHumphreys’ lawyers earlier this month filed a petition asking a judge to order the two members of the parole board to recuse themselves from considering his clemency petition.\n\nThe lawyers said one of those board members, Kimberly McCoy, was previously a victim advocate with the Cobb County district attorney’s office at the time of Humphreys’ trial and was assigned to work with victims in the case.\n\nAnother board member, Wayne Bennett, was the sheriff in Glynn County, where the trial was moved because of pretrial publicity. Humphreys’ lawyers say Bennett oversaw security for the jurors and Humphreys himself during the case.\n\nIn an order filed Monday, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney wrote that “pressing ‘pause’ on the execution machinery until we answer the non-frivolous question raised by Petitioner concerning the proper composition of the Board for his clemency hearing is the correct course of action.”\n\nHe ordered lawyers for both sides to file additional legal briefs on the issue by Jan. 19.\n\nAdditionally, the judge wrote in his order that Humphreys deserves to have the conflict of interest question researched and argued thoroughly so that a parole board free of conflicts of interest can decide his case at a clemency hearing.",

    "fullText": "AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson\n\nThe concerning stories about President Donald Trump’s health aren’t going away anytime soon, especially if Drudge Report has anything to say (or aggregate) about it.\n\nThe president has been occasionally seen in public with a bruised hand in recent months, but recently he has appeared with two bruised hands.\n\nOn Sunday, the president welcomed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to Mar-a-Lago, and Trump appeared to be wearing different colors of concealer on each hand.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt insisted that the discoloration on Trump’s right hand is due to handshakes.\n\n“President Trump is a man of the people and he meets more Americans and shakes their hands on a daily basis than any other President in history. His commitment is unwavering and he proves that every single day,” Leavitt told The Daily Beast for an article titled, “Trump’s Bruises Spread in Blow to Leavitt’s Handshake Claim.” The press secretary did not explain the discoloration on the president’s left hand.\n\nIn another post, the U.K.’s Express highlighted the concerns some on social media aired, including that of liberal poster Aaron Rupar, who wrote, “There appears to be a hole in Trump’s left hand.”\n\nOn Monday night, Drudge Report brought the issue to the fore with links to the stories, the lines “BRUISES SPREAD” and “‘HOLE IN HAND,'” as well as an image of Trump’s hands, the size of which he defended in 2016.\n\n“I have to say this, he hit my hands,” Trump, then a first-time presidential candidate, said of an attack from opponent Marco Rubio. “Nobody has ever hit my hands. I’ve never heard of this one. Look at those hands. Are they small hands? And he referred to my hands if they’re small, something else must be small.\n\nTrump added, “I guarantee you there’s no problem. I guarantee you.”\n\nDuring recent public appearances, the president has been seen covering his right hand with his left hand and sometimes a bandage.\n\nThe post ‘Bruises Spread’: Drudge Report Highlights Alarming Stories on Trump’s ‘Hole in Hand’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Iraq’s decision to introduce the Ja’fari law in January means that girls can be married based on perceived “maturity and physical capacity.”\n\nBaghdad’s bridal industry has seen a massive boom since Iraq legalized child marriage, and human rights organizations have warned that young girls are being auctioned off in black market sales to older men, a Sunday Times investigation revealed on Saturday.\n\nThe relatives of Amani, a 12-year-oldgirl set to be married off to a 17-year-old she has never met, told the Sunday Times that the ceremony would go ahead “without the need for her permission.”\n\nA local cleric confirmed that Amani could be married, as she had started puberty.\n\nIraq’s decision to introduce the Ja’fari law in January means that girls can be married based on perceived “maturity and physical capacity.”\n\nOne of Amani’s relatives admitted that, after the amendment passed, four of her younger cousins were quickly married off to older men for “financial reasons.”\n\nAn activist told the paper that under the new law, “parents can exchange daughters for money or status,” and the legislation amounted to “legalizing child rape.”\n\nEven before the law passed, 28% of girls in Iraq were married before the age of 18, and a further 22% of unregistered marriages involve girls under 14, the United Nations reported in 2023.\n\nGhezi, who oversees shelters for runaway girls of forced marriage under The Organization of Women’s Freedom Iraq (OWFI) in Baghdad, confirmed to the paper, “We have seen a growing black market in Iraq where fathers are selling their daughters, pulling them out of education, mostly because of poverty … but they have been encouraged by some [clerics] who may benefit.”\n\nGhezi added, “These are children who are not aware that their husbands can use the Ja’fari law to strip their rights — they can divorce them, marry a second wife, and take their children without dispute.”\n\nClerics often take a fee for blessing marriages, religious officials in Kadhimiya confirmed. One official admitted to talking a 15-year-old out of divorcing her husband, adding he would only discuss the subject “with her father’s permission.”\n\nDozens of businesses confirmed to the British outlet that since the Ja’fari law passed, they had increased sales.\n\nBaraa Macer, an influencer and bridal makeup artist, admitted that many of her clients are now under 10.\n\nA video allegedly displaying an 11-year-old girl cloaked in white shared on Macer’s page gained more than 250,000 views. Macer declined to confirm whether the content was monetized.\n\nAnother Iraqi makeup artist, Zainab Saleem, also known as Makera Dobaa, claimed she disagreed with child marriage but shared her underage client’s videos because “younger brides get more views” and people ask for ages in the comments.\n\nSaleem said her youngest client this year was 14, though confirmed that her clients this year had been younger than in previous.\n\nRuweida, a bridal make-up artist in Sadr City, also said her clients this year were “almost entirely children.”\n\nRuweida described a “10-year-old girl who cried throughout her hair and makeup, and still her family was proud to say she was marrying an older man. She was trying to resist, but I could see she had bruises all over her head … this is very common.”",

    "fullText": "A winter weather blast has wreaked havoc across Metro Detroit including on the roads.\n\nA large crash involving multiple vehicles happened on NB I-75 near McNichols.\n\nSnow squalls and high winds have led to power outages and slow driving conditions.\n\nFOX 2 - Snow squall conditions led to a large crash scene involving three semi-trucks, and about two dozen vehicles on I-75 in Detroit Monday afternoon.\n\nThe crash scene on the northbound side of the freeway after McNichols has been cleared and that side of the freeway is now open. Some final tows were needed and some salt treatments were required on the roadway.\n\nAccording to state police, several small crashes may be the culprit rather than one large pile-up.\n\nCooper, a driver who was caught in the middle of the chain of freeway crashes, said that the snow squall created a white-out condition. His car slammed underneath a semi-truck, he said - coming away injured somehow.\n\n\"It was a whiteout with no visibility and like I said, everyone was going 25 or 30 until they weren't. My car got totaled,\" he said.\n\nThe exact number of vehicles involved, is not known at this time.  All lanes were blocked.\n\n\"Some of the semis may have struggled, some of the cars may have struggled, whatever it is this is probably going to (last) the majority of the day,\" said Diane Cross of MDOT in a phone interview with FOX 2. \"At the moment we have northbound 75 closed at McNichols. Don't be surprised if we move that back to the Davison so that traffic can move freeway to freeway.\"\n\nCross said that special towing vehicles were needed for the semi-trucks.\n\n\"We have EMS, Michigan State Police out there to determine the cause.\"\n\nAccording to MDOT, the left shoulder, left lane, right center lane, right lane and right shoulder are all blocked.\n\nThe backup stretched for miles with an early estimate of at least 20 vehicles or more.\n\nRoad conditions have been challenging all day due to an active winter weather day that began with fierce winds and continued with blinding snow squalls.\n\nWest M-10 and Woodward are possible alternate routes according to Cross.\n\nPower outages have been reported by DTE Energy while a number of flights have been delayed or canceled at Metropolitan Airport in Romulus.\n\nStay with FOX 2 \n\nInformation for this report is from MDOT and multiple sources.",

    "fullText": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Some Iowans are ringing in 2026 with a special election on the final Tuesday of the year, casting ballots for a state senator in a race that offers Republicans an opportunity to reclaim two-thirds control of the chamber.\n\nDemocrat Renee Hardman faces Republican Lucas Loftin in the special election for the state Senate seat representing parts of Des Moines’ suburbs. The seat is vacant after the Oct. 6 death of state Sen. Claire Celsi, a Democrat.\n\nFlipping the seat would give Republicans supermajority status once again, just months after a Democrat flipped a Republican seat in an August special election, giving Democrats 17 seats to Republicans' 33. Celsi's death left the Democratic caucus at 16.\n\nSenate Republicans left Des Moines last spring with a supermajority, which allows the party to easily confirm Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds’ appointments to state agencies and commissions. A Hardman win in Tuesday's election would limit Republicans’ power in the Senate as lawmakers prepare to return to Des Moines for the 2026 legislative session. Without a supermajority, Republicans would have to rely on support from at least one Democrat to approve Reynolds' nominees.\n\nDemocrats outnumber Republicans in the district by about 3,300 voters, 37% to 30%, but a holiday week special election may prove more volatile.\n\nAbout a third of registered voters in the district are affiliated with another party or register without a political party.\n\nCelsi won her 2024 reelection bid against a Libertarian competitor with 69% of the district electorate. But she earned a smaller majority of voters in 2022 – 58% — against a Republican, who earned 42% of the vote. That was similar to the share Republican President Donald Trump received in the district last year.\n\nHardman, who would be the first Black woman elected to the Iowa state Senate, is the CEO of nonprofit Lutheran Services of Iowa and a member of the West Des Moines City Council. Loftin, who started as a tree trimmer for Wright Service Corp. in 2007, has since transitioned to software and data project management for the environmental services company.\n\nSchoenbaum reported from Salt Lake City, Utah.",

    "description": "These teams could roll the dice.",
    "fullText": "Finding the best fits for mid-round quarterbacks in the 2026 NFL Draft originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe story of the 2026 NFL Draft's quarterback class will be defined by its thinning at the top. Fernando Mendoza is the odds-on favorite to go 1.01. If he declares, Oregon's Dante Moore shouldn't last much longer. But this isn't the class the football world was sold, and teams' actions early in the offseason will reflect that.\n\nInstead, we are left with an unsteady crop of quarterbacks, many of whom decided to return to school. The seniors that aren't afforded that option are headed to the league with less hype than the summer suggested and little expectations of rookie-year playing time.\n\nIn an NFL era that has rendered the Day 2 quarterback an endangered species, several passers may fall into Day 3. While that has consequences for their rookie contracts, it could also open the door for more competitive teams offering a promising path to development.\n\nGarrett Nussmeier, LSU: Arizona Cardinals\n\nA Day 2 option that I've penciled into prior mock drafts is Nussmeier heading to the desert. It may not come as early as initially anticipated, but there's reason to believe that both parties could benefit from a fresh start.\n\nKyler Murray has proven he isn't the answer in Arizona. He may return for one last stand, but at some point, the Cardinals will need a new option under center. Unlike the out-of-structure prowess that Murray enjoys, Nussmeier projects more like a game manager. Similar to Jacoby Brissett, Nussmeier can win pre-snap and run the offense as it's intended, opening up the middle of the field and feeding receivers with more consistent targets.\n\nThe Cardinals prefer Brissett's style to Murray. Opting for Nussmeier provides a similar skill set with more credibility as a long-term option.\n\nNussmeier dealt with an injury to his midsection and wasn't quite as polished in 2025. As the floor drops on his stock, Arizona can take a shot on a new passer without wasting resources on a potential first-round prospect in 2027.\n\nJohn Mateer, Oklahoma: Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n\nThe Buccaneers have been beneficiaries of Baker Mayfield's career resurgence. Unfortunately for Tampa, his step back has left them closer to quarterback purgatory than they would like to admit.\n\nI'm lower than most on Mayfield, but this isn't an indictment on his status as next year's quarterback. He'll likely return and do so with the optimism of a healthier squad (and probably a new head coach). We know that this offense can work around Mayfield's measurable shortcomings, and living with his volatility has been a welcome part of the experience. Thus, a pivot to Mateer in April makes sense.\n\nMORE: Cole Payton gives Senior Bowl a small-school boost at quarterback\n\nMateer wouldn't start right away, but his similarities to Mayfield make him a viable backup in this offense and provide the Buccaneers with an off-ramp if contract talks get messy.\n\nMateer needs development before he starts on Sundays. He's more comfortable out of structure than inside it, draws pressure on himself in the pocket, and can be too reliant on his legs. Still, that mobility should amplify a below-average backfield in ways that Mayfield's scrambling has not.\n\nAt Oklahoma, Mateer's play style and moxie made him the Sooners' spiritual successor to Mayfield. He could have a similar opportunity in a perpetually-winnable NFC South.\n\nCarson Beck, Miami: Indianapolis Colts\n\nIndianapolis has created a special kind of catastrophe. Daniel Jones seems likely to return, albeit off an Achilles and not necessarily ready for Week 1. With limited mobility, he's a tough passer to trust. An orbital fracture further curtailed Anthony Richardson's development. I don't know what the Year 4 version of him looks like, and after his historically poor performances in 2024, I'm not sure I (nor Shane Steichen) want to find out.\n\nThe Colts don't have the ammo to take an early-round passer, either. This is a room that, as currently constructed, has one of the lowest floors in football.\n\nIndianapolis needs a polished passer who can keep Steichen's offense on the tracks and do enough for the ground game to churn out victories. Early on Day 3, Miami's Carson Beck might be the best bet to do so.\n\nDespite flashing early in the year (and entering the 2025 cycle as the preseason QB1), Beck profiles as a backup who has more present-day competence than long-term upside. He's played a lot of college ball against premium competition and has enough tools to trust with playing time. Throw in the allure of Steichen's wizardry and squint hard enough, and Beck is a low-risk dice roll of getting the Colts out of this mess.\n\nDrew Allar, Penn State: Detroit Lions\n\nIt was a nightmare season for everyone in Happy Valley, none more than Drew Allar.\n\nOnce a first-round hopeful, Allar began the cycle as a Day 2 option with enough upside to get Round 1 looks. He struggled in 2025, and an ankle injury ended his college career.\n\nThere is significant uncertainty in this profile. His broken ankle could dampen his athleticism, limit a skill-set that wasn't particularly twitchy, or keep him from getting crucial reps for his intangible development. He could also be fine! But no longer is Allar a polarizing passer for teams to take at a discount.\n\nAllar never proved he could cash in on his elite physical traits, even with Penn State's army of top recruits. Now, he enters the league without a real platform year and injury concerns headlining his profile.\n\nAllar needs to land on a team with a strong offensive infrastructure and no demand to play in Year 1. Few teams check those boxes like the Detroit Lions. Jared Goff isn't going anywhere anytime soon, and it doesn't make sense to move him until after the 2026 season, regardless of his performance.\n\nYet, the Lions' window is closing fast, and as Super Bowl aspirations shrink, patience for Goff will follow. There's a world in which the 2027 Lions are led by another quarterback, leaving at least one season for Allar to get healthy and develop in the incubator of Detroit's offense. Armed with an elite ground game, quality receivers, and a good young coach, Allar makes about as much sense on paper as a Day 3 project can get.\n\nCole Payton, North Dakota State: Carolina Panthers\n\nThere's a fog of war that comes with evaluating NDSU talents. The talent gap between the Bison and their competition is as fierce as any in college football, and their NFL quarterbacks have reflected that uncertainty. Carson Wentz was an MVP favorite who quickly became a castaway. Easton Stick never stuck, and Trey Lance will start in Week 18 on his third team in as many years.\n\nPayton doesn't have to follow any of those paths, but the pre-draft circuit will be crucial in selling himself to NFL evaluators.\n\nThe Panthers can't get away with drafting a quarterback in Round 1, especially if they win in Week 18 and get to host a playoff game. That doesn't change their circumstances under center, where Young has taken a bumpy road to below average.\n\nEventually, Carolina will look to move off of Young and the limitations of being the league's shortest passer. Payton offers an imposing frame as a rusher and surplus arm talent, earning him some looks as a potential starter. Sitting behind Young gives him a chance to learn under quarterback guru Dave Canales, and if he gets a chance to play, that same volatility could serve the Panthers well.\n\nIf Payton starts and plays well, Carolina can strike gold and justify moving on from Young. If the jump from NDSU to the NFL is too large for Payton to clear, he might be bad enough to get the Panthers a top pick. In either scenario, he's unlikely to set the career mark for lowest yards per completion, unlike Carolina's current quarterback.\n\nEmmett Johnson scouting report: Nebraska's back makes case for RB2\n\nTop prospects the Kansas City Chiefs can pick after Patrick Mahomes' injury\n\nArch Manning's NFL Draft decision means doubling down on Texas\n\nLaNorris Sellers' 2026 NFL Draft decision leaves more questions than answers",

The Athletic’s James L. Edwards III broke down Hart’s lower-body setback on Saturday.\n\n“New York Knicks do-it-all guard Josh Hart will miss at least the next three games with a right sprained ankle,” Edwards reported.\n\n“Hart suffered the injury in the fourth quarter of New York’s Christmas Day victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers.”\n\n“Hart, per league sources, is still undergoing further tests and will be reevaluated when the Knicks return from a three-game road trip that begins against the Atlanta Hawks on Saturday and ends with the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday.”\n\nThere’s no question it’ll be difficult for the Knicks to be the best version of themselves without Hart in the lineup.\n\nThe Villanova product is among the best rebounding guards in the league, always plays under control, is an underrated downhill attacker, and is a much-improved perimeter shooting threat.\n\nHart is averaging 12.3 points, 8.0 rebounds, and 5.1 assists per game with New York this season, shooting 49.8% from the field and 38.9% from beyond the arc.\n\nHopefully, Hart isn’t sidelined for an extended period.\n\nMore NBA: Golf could play surprising factor in Lakers' LeBron James' retirement decision",

His return in late August was iffy, with three poor relief appearances of five. But he ended the season with a scoreless (two-inning) “opener” start, which hopefully reverses the curse for 2026.\n\nJuan Carela\nRight-Handed Starting Pitcher\nAge 24\n2024 High Level Birmingham (AA)\nAge relative to high level -2.5 years\nOverall 2024 MiLB stats (High-A/AA) 7-7▪️ 23 starts ▪️ 106 2⁄3 IP ▪️ 3.77 ERA ▪️ 114 K▪️ 45 BB ▪️ 1.238 WHIP ▪️ 1.5 WAR\n\nCarela has mostly flown under the radar since being acquired from the Yankees in at the 2023 trade deadline. But he has forced his way into an increasingly crowded rotation situation at this point, punctuated by seven brilliant starts for Birmingham to end the 2024 season yielding a 3.58 ERA and 1.163 WHIP while being well underage for the level. Just as Carela was moving closer to Charlotte and/or possible MLB appearances, he blew out his arm last March and underwent TJS.\n\nReudis Diaz\nRight-handed relief pitcher\nAge 20\n2025 high level ACL (Rookie)\nAge relative to high level -2.1 years\nOverall 2025 stats 1-1 ▪️ 1 SV▪️ 21 games (4 finishes) ▪️ 27 2/3 IP ▪️ 2.28.ERA ▪️ 18 K ▪️ 8 BB ▪️ 1.084 WHIP ▪️1.2 WAR\n\nWho? You’re forgiven for being unfamiliar with an extremely young arm who hasn’t yet gotten out of rookie ball, but our No. 77 prospect a year ago (then a starter, repeating the DSL and killing it) made a successful adjustment Stateside. He’ll return to starting in 2026, likely getting his feet wet in Arizona and getting a promotion to Low-A in the second half of the season.\n\nJacob Gonzalez\nSecond Baseman\nAge 23\n2024 SSS Prospect Poll ranking 9\n2025 SSS Prospect Poll ranking 24\n2025 high level Charlotte (AAA)\nAge relative to high level -3.3 years\nOverall 2025 stats (AA/AAA) 134 games ▪️ 8 HR ▪️ 61 RBI ▪️ .232/.307/.345 ▪️ 17-of-20 (85.0%) SB ▪️ 48 BB ▪️ 86 K ▪️ .990 FLD%▪️ 3.1 WAR\n\nAfter the incredible first half/awful second of 2024, Gonzalez rebounded for a solid campaign, the final third of which came in Charlotte. However, his time in Charlotte, a hitter’s playground, was a significant step back on offense. He’s on the cusp of the bigs but has created questions whether he’ll produce at all with the stick on the South Side.\n\nLucas Gordon\nLeft-Handed Starting Pitcher\nAge 24\n2025 high level Birmingham (AA)\nAge relative to high level -1.7 years\nOverall 2025 stats (High-A/AA) 3-11▪️ 24 starts ▪️ 107 2/3 IP ▪️ 3.59 ERA ▪️ 116 K ▪️ 42 BB ▪️ 1.161 WHIP ▪️ 1.5 WAR\n\nSomehow still, in completing his third season as a pro, Gordon is still vastly underrated. All he has done is put up a career 2.80 ERA while taking on a significant workload each season. Sure, there’s no overpowering fastball there, but Gordon’s cup of coffee at Double-A (where he vastly improved his ERA, 2.11 over four starts) indicates that he may evade the wall that softer tossers hit once they are in the upper minors.\n\nRiley Gowens\nRight-Handed Starting Pitcher\nAge 26\n2025 high level Birmingham (AA)\nAge relative to high level +0.3 years\nOverall 2025 stats 7-6▪️ 27 starts ▪️ 132 IP ▪️ 3.44 ERA ▪️ 151 K ▪️ 49 BB ▪️ 1.189 WHIP ▪️ 2.0 WAR\n\n“Workhorse” is not the sexiest attribute for a prospect, but it’s no chopped liver adjective, either. And Gowens is just that, topping system starters with 27 starts, 132 innings and 151 Ks. And yet somehow he has evaded the praise handed to 2025 wunderkind Tanner McDougal, despite some obvious similarities. He should get the call to Charlotte to start 2026 and be on the short list, alongside McDougal, for first call-up for a start in the majors.\n\nLandon Hodge\nCatcher\nAge 19\n2025 high level Crespi Carmelite H.S. (Encino, Calif.)\nScouting grades (40-80 scale) Hit 45 ▪️ Power 40 ▪️ Run 50 ▪️ Arm 55 ▪️ Field 50 ▪️ Overall 40\n\nThis teammate of White Sox first-rounder (and SSS Top Prospect Vote No. 7 player) Billy Carlson made history simply by being drafted (fourth round, No. 107 overall). The very first pick of Day 2 of the draft was a somewhat curious one, given MLB’s ranking as the 164th-best talent available in the draft and the presence of much more enticing talents (as high as MLB’s No. 35 prospect) passed over on Day 1. Hodge has a killer arm (another characteristic he shares with Carlson) and has a solid hit tool that’s more average than power.\n\nJavier Mogollón\nShortstop\nAge 20\n2025 high level Kannapolis (Low-A)\nAge relative to high level -1.4 years\nOverall 2025 stats 51 games ▪️ 5 HR ▪️ 19 RBI ▪️ .220/.347/.387 ▪️ 15-of-21 (71.4%) SB ▪️ 30 BB ▪️ 56 K ▪️ .971 FLD%▪️ 1.0 WAR\n\nAn ascending star just one year ago, we have to tap the breaks a bit on Mogollón after a lackluster first full season of minors ball. While still young for his level and managing to keep his head above water in a new league every season of his career, Mogollón’s undeniable hitting in Rookie ball fell off significantly with the Cannon Ballers. However, how much of that was due to battling injury is undetermined, as Mogollón was shelved for what turned out to be the season on July 2.\n\nRikuu Nishida\nRight Fielder\nAge 24\n2025 SSS Prospect Poll ranking 28 \n2025 high level Birmingham (AA)\nAge relative to high level +0.3 years\nOverall 2025 stats 115 games ▪️ 0 HR ▪️ 31 RBI ▪️ .273/.403/.308 ▪️ 40-of-52 (76.9%) SB ▪️ 75 BB ▪️ 69 K ▪️ .986 FLD%▪️ 2.6 WAR\n\nWhat other testament to Nishida’s flexibility can there be but to say in three years in our Top 100, his primary position has changed from left field to second base to right field. You won’t find a stranger profile in the White Sox system, as Nishida’s profile is one of extreme on-base ability and baserunning peskiness, at the expense of any power whatsoever. He was a seeming shoo-in for Charlotte at some point last summer, but stalled in Double-A.\n\nTyler Schweitzer\nLeft-Handed Starting Pitcher\nAge 25\n2025 high level Charlotte (AAA)\nAge relative to high level -3.3 years\nOverall 2025 stats (AA/AAA) 8-2 ▪️ 27 games (10 starts) ▪️ 99 2/3 IP ▪️4.61 ERA ▪️ 81 K ▪️ 41 BB ▪️ 1.344 WHIP ▪️ 0.8 WAR\n\nSchweitzer relieved in most of his games in 2025, but he remains a starter in our eyes given he was consistently paired with Tanner McDougal in Birmingham Barons starts. And in Birmingham, Schweitzer was divine: 1.27 ERA that included a long scoreless streak leading to a Charlotte promotion, 0.946 WHIP. However, everything the southpaw did as a Baron, he undid as a Knight (7.92 ERA, 1.740 ERA). While other gilded arms (Drew Thorpe, Grant Taylor) get to skip Charlotte entirely, Schweitzer was not so lucky. And that luck could prevent him from ever seeing the majors.\n\nGage Ziehl\nRight-Handed Starting Pitcher\nAge 22\n2025 high level Somerset (Yankees AA)\nAge relative to high level -2.7 years\nOverall 2025 stats (Low-A/High-A/AA) 7-6 ▪️ 22 games (21 starts, 1 finish) ▪️ 107 IP ▪️4.12 ERA ▪️ 90 K ▪️ 19 BB ▪️ 1.262 WHIP ▪️ 1.4 WAR\n\nZiehl was the return from the Yankees in the trade deadline swap of Austin Slater, and based on the nothing value of Slater this trade can’t possibly be a loss for the White Sox. The righty was a busy arm even before the trade, pitching at three levels for New York and settling at High-A for the White Sox. Pitching young for his level, Ziehl held his own pretty well.\n\nPast South Side Sox Prospect votes\n\nHere is how 2018 wrangled out — all 42 picks.

    "fullText": "One of Colorado‘s quarterbacks plans to enter the NCAA transfer portal. Ryan Staub, a redshirt sophomore, intends to enter on Jan. 2 when the portal opens, per On3’s Hayes Fawcett.\n\nStaub has played relatively sparingly for the Buffaloes over the past three seasons. He initially saw some playing time as a freshman in 2023, before he failed to complete a pass the following year.\n\nRyan Staub went 23-of-40 passing for 254 yards and a touchdown as a freshman in 2023, showing some promise. Of course, Colorado was relatively set at quarterback already with Shedeur Sanders taking over and eventually turning into an NFL Draft pick at the position.\n\nBecause Sanders had such a stranglehold on the job in 2023 and 2024, Staub threw just four passes as a redshirt freshman in 2024. He did not complete any of them, and he was sacked once.\n\nIn 2025, with Sanders off to the NFL, Ryan Staub some some limited work. His biggest set of action came in early September, when he played in games against Delaware and at Houston. In the Houston game, Staub went 19-of-35 passing for 204 yards and a touchdown. However, he was picked off twice. He also ran 11 times for 36 yards, showing some decent mobility.\n\nBut Staub would throw only 10 passes the rest of the season. He finished the year 30-of-55 passing for 427 yards, with three touchdowns and four interceptions. He also ran for one score.\n\nPrior to enrolling at Colorado, Ryan Staub was ranked as a three-star prospect and the No. 733 overall player in the 2023 class, according to the On3 Consensus. He also checked in as the No. 39 quarterback in the class and the No. 63 overall player from the state of California, hailing from Stevenson Ranch (CA) West Ranch.\n\nStaub figures to generate some interest in the transfer portal. He’s a quarterback who has seen some action in a major power conference game.",

    "description": "Utah Jazz forward has a chance to get his second All-Star bid in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Lauri Markkanen has a chance to make the 2026 NBA All-Star team.\n\nThe Utah Jazz forward was in the Western Conference’s top 20 in the first returns from All-Star fan voting. He came in at 16th in the West with just over 112,000 votes.\n\nWhile the top vote getters have already racked up more than 1 million fan votes, that doesn’t mean Markkanen is out of the running to make a team.\n\nThis year, as in years past, there will be 24 total All-Stars (12 from each conference) selected. But, there are two key differences to this year’s All-Star team format. This year, All-Stars will be selected without regard to position, so no more worrying about having a certain number of backcourt or frontcourt players.\n\nAlso, this year there will be three All-Star teams made up of a minimum of eight players. There will be two U.S. teams and one World team made up of international players.\n\nLuka Dončić and Giannis Antetokounmpo lead their conferences in the first fan returns in NBA All-Star Voting 2026.\n\nFans (50% of the vote) join NBA players (25%) and a media panel (25%) in selecting five players in each conference honored as starters.\n\nNext fan update: 1/6. pic.twitter.com/pHykl9yhTE\n\n— NBA Communications (@NBAPR) December 29, 2025\n\nThe five All-Star starters from each conference are determind by fans (50% of the vote), current NBA players (25%) and media votes (25%). Seven reserves for each conference are selected by NBA head coaches.\n\nAs the voting returns stand, Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Victor Wembanyama and Giannis Antetokounmpo will be easy top choices for the World team. So it looks like Markkanen will be competing for a reserve spot with Portland’s Deni Avdija, Houston’s Alperen Sengun, New York’s Karl Anthony-Towns, Indiana’s Pascal Siakam, Denver’s Jamal Murray and Chicago’s Josh Giddey.\n\nThrough 27 games played this season, Markkanen is averaging 27.9 points and 6.9 rebounds per game, while shooting 47.6% overall, 36.7% from 3-point range and 90.3% from the free-throw line. He made his first All-Star appearance in 2023, when he was an All-Star starter in the game that was hosted in Utah.",

    "fullText": "Imagine the world as you know it. Now, add 10 million people who care about birds. Did your world just get a little brighter?\n\nTen million. It’s an astronomical number. And yet that is exactly what Merlin, the free bird ID app developed by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, has accomplished since launching in 2014. Ten million active users the world over, from experts in the field to neophytes who let the app run in the background during their morning routine—and they’re turning enthusiasm and newfound joy into participatory science that helps protect birds and biodiversity.\n\nFrom Serbia: “It is my honor and pleasure that 165 of my photos were used to train Merlin to identify birds.”\n\nFrom Costa Rica: “Great for beginners. It motivates you to keep expanding your life list.”\n\nFrom India: “The app is so user-friendly…you can know about a lot of birds around you based on the pictures and their calls.”\n\nFrom the U.S.: “My four-year-old daughter and I were using Merlin to identify about 12 birds in our backyard. My daughter said to me, Daddy, your phone is magical. I’ve been programming for over 40 years. Merlin amazes me too.”\n\nSo how is it that millions of people now hold this magic in their pockets? To satisfy that question, we have to go back nearly two decades when the Lab’s idea for a bird ID app first hatched.\n\nThe year was 2008 and the Cornell Lab wanted to expand the capability of its online guide, All About Birds. According to Miyoko Chu, senior director of Science Communications at the Lab, users wanted more than the site could provide. “When we looked at analytics, we saw a lot of people typing in phrases like little brown bird. It became clear they were trying to use our website as a bird ID tool.”\n\nWhen we looked at analytics, we saw a lot of people typing in phrases like little brown bird. It became clear they were trying to use our website as a bird ID tool.\n\nIn the aftermath of the financial crisis, the Lab didn’t have capacity to reimagine All About Birds. These were the early days of broad-based artificial intelligence, so the team brainstormed a game of 20 questions that would utilize machine learning to produce a positive bird ID and proposed it to the National Science Foundation. “The heart of the proposal,” says Miyoko, “was the power of a bird’s name. If you see something and you don’t know its name, it’s really hard to learn more. But as soon as you can call it a Yellow Warbler, you’ve got all the information in the world at your fingertips.”\n\nAfter winning the NSF grant, the team needed to figure out how to teach the machine-learning model how to identify birds. Jessie Barry, who now leads the Merlin program through the Lab’s Macaulay Library, cites AI as the reason the project was funded, but concedes that the initial machine-learning task didn’t work all that well. “We didn’t have enough data,” says Jessie. Meanwhile, the team discovered a faster solution: the power of eBird data.\n\nIn the early 2010s, eBird, the Lab’s worldwide bird observation platform, was taking off. Tens of thousands of birdwatchers had already contributed millions of sightings, and their observations added two crucial factors: time of year and location. This meant that instead of trying to guess among, say, 800 species, eBird could help narrow it down to the few dozen species a person would most likely see. With just three more questions, it presented an answer. With time and location in hand, the team was able to compress the initial 20 questions into a simple five-question rubric to identify birds.\n\nHalfway through development, the team met another “grant”—Grant Van Horn, an undergrad at UCSD knocking on doors and looking for professors to work with. He had joined Caltech’s Visipedia project aimed at training computers to recognize objects in photos, using machine learning. To source the photos, they looked to Flickr, the world’s largest photo-sharing site at the time. According to Grant, “Flickr’s top photos of the day were some landscapes, a few portraits of people, and, inevitably, birds.”\n\nThe question quickly became: Can we train a computer to recognize all these bird photos?\n\n“The Visipedia team had scraped the web to build this dataset,” says Jessie, “but many of the birds were misidentified.” In a spirit of sharing and collaboration, the teams partnered to build a robust and accurate archive of images. As Jessie remembers it, “We approached a bunch of friends to get their photos off Flickr as a way to build the dataset.” By 2010, they’d collected enough images to have a basic working model. According to Jessie, “We were thinking, okay, 25% of the time, maybe this pre-Merlin system could identify a bird accurately.”\n\nAnother breakthrough came when the team realized they could build out Macaulay’s image archive by enabling eBirders to upload photos directly into the Macaulay Library as a part of their checklists. It has become a virtuous cycle; as birders share more images, the results get more accurate. Today, Macaulay’s archive is an asset that simply can’t be replicated anywhere else. On average, eBird users contribute an image every two seconds, and the accuracy of Merlin’s visual ID hovers around 98%.\n\n“By the way,” Miyoko adds, “this was almost not funded. Some of the NSF reviewers were quite skeptical, asking, How is this teaching anyone? It’s basically doing all the work for people, you’re just giving them the answer.”\n\nWhat impact would this new app have on the world of birding? Or, for that matter, on how people learn?\n\nWhere did the name Merlin come from? Miyoko remembers flipping through names of birds and coming to rest on the Merlin, a falcon that is both small and fierce. Merlin populations declined in the 20th century due to DDT and other pesticides, but bounced back once those were banned. Of course, Merlin also refers to the mythical sorcerer in King Arthur’s court. “We’d always talked about it being this magical experience where you would be so surprised that this name could pop up and give you the answer you were looking for,” says Miyoko. The team rallied around the name and began making final preparations for the app’s release.\n\nOn average, eBird users contribute an image every two seconds, and the accuracy of Merlin’s visual ID hovers around 98%.\n\nWith the NSF grant nearing its end, a fork in the road came when it was time to decide what to charge for Merlin. Alex Chang, who was leading the team’s web communications, says, “At that time, companies were selling their apps for $1, and it was moving toward $2.” But the Lab wanted to build a community, not just revenue. So Alex, who was also pursuing an MBA at Cornell at the time, wrote a business case showing that it was more valuable to offer Merlin for free in exchange for an email address.\n\nThat decision led to far more downloads, including in countries where any fee might be a significant barrier. It also gave the Lab a channel to connect with its users. Today, Merlin is at the heart of rapid growth in the number of participants and supporters of Lab programs, which has helped transform the scale of the Lab’s global conservation work. Merlin has become the Lab’s front door.\n\nThe app launched in 2014 with the ability to ID 285 species—just the most common backyard birds in North America—using the five-question rubric Jessie’s team developed . In 2015, Drew Weber joined the team to broaden Merlin’s geographic footprint. Drew is now the project manager on the Merlin team, and has helped expand Merlin to include 11,000 species, nearly every known bird in the world. When he comes through customs after an international birding trip, the agents get excited when he tells them what he does for a living. “We love Merlin,” they say.\n\n“Merlin is a wide funnel that brings people into the world of birds,” Drew says. “Some of those folks are going to download eBird and start collecting data. Some of them are going to start caring about birds and give money to protect their habitats. But for many others, Merlin simply lets them start to recognize and enjoy the birds around them in a way that wouldn’t have happened otherwise.”\n\nSusan Fox Rogers, author of Learning the Birds, agrees. “Merlin changed everything. This is something to celebrate in every possible way.” Susan started birding at age 49. “When I first went out, I couldn’t do it by myself. I needed the John Burroughs club, I needed to get to a baseline. It took two or three years, maybe 20 trips.” It used to be that to become an expert, you had to learn from another expert. But for millions of learners of all ages, Merlin has become their mentor.\n\nBut there was another quest on the horizon—one for the “holy grail,” as the Lab’s former executive director John W. Fitzpatrick puts it. For decades, the Lab had been trying to crack tech’s ability to identify birds by sound. Could Merlin become the “Shazam for birds”?\n\nIn many ways, it’s an unfair comparison: Shazam is an app trained to recognize the one true signature of a pop song in the swirl of a crowded room. Birds are different. They have more than one call. Songs differ slightly each time they’re sung. And even members of the same species can develop distinct dialects region to region. Add to that the sound of wind. Traffic. Your shoes crunching the forest floor. Or what about sound dampeners, like buildings and trees? Not to mention the songs of other birds.\n\nIf we get to the point where one in 20 people in the U.S. is engaged with birds when a local land trust reaches out, they’re going to be more ready to hear those messages.\n\nAs Jessie Barry remembers it, “When the pandemic hit in 2020, we saw [the number of] Merlin users go through the roof. So many people were watching birds, sometimes for the first time. It was a dream come true: The world is paying attention to birds. What can we do with this opportunity?”\n\nWhile attending an audio workshop in New York City with Jessie, Grant Van Horn was inspired by presentations that included spectrograms. “What struck me,” says Grant, “was that we were looking at photos of audio. I thought, Wait, they just take their audio and make a picture? I’m a computer vision researcher, I can absolutely work with that!”\n\nThe timing was right: eBird had just begun accepting audio uploads in 2015. That meant Grant had five years’ worth of recordings to experiment with. “Someone told me Merlin’s photo ID couldn’t distinguish between the Alder and the Willow Flycatchers. I wasn’t really a birder before all this, so I asked my colleagues how you’d tell them apart in real life and they told me they’d listen to the vocalizations.”\n\nSo like the presenters at the audio conference, Grant made pictures. Specifically, he took 30 audio clips apiece for both flycatcher species and rendered spectrograms. Just as he’d trained Merlin’s algorithms to recognize images of birds, Grant now used the same technology to recognize images of their sounds. “The computer was perfect. It’s like, 100% accuracy.”\n\nTo make Sound ID feel miraculous, Merlin needs to bank at least 100 clean recordings of every call for each species. To achieve this, around 350 experts annotate thousands upon thousands of spectrograms made from recordings submitted by people from all over the world. These annotators painstakingly draw and label boxes around individual calls in the spectrograms, helping to train and improve Merlin.\n\nJessie was anxious to get this capability into the hands of people while birds still held their attention, so Sound ID was launched in June 2021. According to Drew Weber, “Each spring, we see a massive uptake. That year we had a double bump in downloads: May for migration and June for Sound ID.”\n\n“When we first started,” says Alex Chang, “we got to number four in the app store’s reference category, and we thought, There’s no way we can beat the Bible, right? Like, how do you beat the Bible? But I guess Sound ID was the answer to that, because we got to number one.”\n\n“Sound ID put Merlin on the map,” says Drew. “It’s in the mainstream conversation now. Sarah Jessica Parker posted about it on Instagram. Sam Darnold, the Seattle Seahawks quarterback, has talked about it at press conferences. Sound ID was a game changer.”\n\nImagine the world as you know it. Now, add 100 million people who care about birds. Add one billion. These numbers may seem improbable, but Merlin’s growth continues to accelerate. This past spring, American usage of Merlin was up 40% over last year. Europe was up 70% over the same period, and there’s double-digit growth in Africa and Asia as well.\n\n“We have a long runway on these projects,” says Jessie Barry. “We’re building out Sound ID in South America, in Africa, really building a global team. We try to look a few years down the road for new opportunities, but right now we’re seeing big returns on the Lab’s mission—connecting people to birds is squarely what Merlin is able to do.”\n\nHow has this marriage of science and tech captivated so many people? “I think you can go all the way back to Arthur Allen and Peter Paul Kellogg,” Jessie continues. “Arthur Allen founded the Lab. Peter Paul Kellogg was an electrical engineer. Together they figured out how to record the first bird sounds in North America in 1929. So in some way, that combination of engineering and ornithology that built Merlin goes back to the Lab’s origin story.”\n\nIn Silent Spring, Rachel Carson’s landmark book about the environmental destruction caused by DDT and other pesticides, she pointed to the “silencing of birds.” What if spring comes and no birds sing? Of course, this formulation only works if people are listening.\n\nWith Merlin, more than 10 million people are tuning into the world around them. “I think we’re just starting to feel the scale of a community,” says Jessie. “If we get to the point where one in 20 people in the U.S. is engaged with birds when, say, a local land trust reaches out, they’re going to be more ready to hear those messages.”\n\nAlready there are signs that the next generation of birders is more conservation-minded. Less focused on personal lists, today’s birders see birds as neighbors. They’re asking questions about what birds need to thrive and what they can do to help. Susan Fox Rogers puts it this way: “If more people are using Merlin, then more people are thinking about birds. You can’t protect something unless you know it. You can’t love something unless you know it.”\n\nTop banner photo credits: Tiktok photos courtesy @theylovefrioo, @nonbinarying, @badgerlandbirding.

    "description": "This was supposed to be the year when autonomous agents took over everyday tasks. The tech industry overpromised and underdelivered.",
    "fullText": "This was no small boast. Chatbots can respond directly to a text-based prompt—by answering a question, say, or writing a rough draft of an e-mail. But an agent, in theory, would be able to navigate the digital world on its own, and complete tasks that require multiple steps and the use of other software, such as web browsers. Consider everything that goes into making a hotel reservation: deciding on the right nights, filtering based on one’s preferences, reading reviews, searching various websites to compare rates and amenities. An agent could conceivably automate all of these activities. The implications of such a technology would be immense. Chatbots are convenient for human employees to use; effective A.I. agents might replace the employees altogether. The C.E.O. of Salesforce, Marc Benioff, who has claimed that half the work at his company is done by A.I., predicted that agents will help unleash a “digital labor revolution,” worth trillions of dollars.\n\nNew Yorker writers reflect on the year’s highs and lows.\n\n2025 was heralded as the Year of the A.I. Agent in part because, by the end of 2024, these tools had become undeniably adept at computer programming. A demo of OpenAI’s Codex agent, from May, showed a user asking the tool to modify his personal website. “Add another tab next to investment/tools that is called ‘food I like.’ In the doc put—tacos,” the user wrote. The chatbot quickly carried out a sequence of interconnected actions: it reviewed the files in the website’s directory, examined the contents of a promising file, then used a search command to find the right location to insert a new line of code. After the agent learned how the site was structured, it used this information to successfully add a new page that featured tacos. As a computer scientist myself, I had to admit that Codex was tackling the task more or less as I would. Silicon Valley grew convinced that other difficult tasks would soon be conquered.\n\nAs 2025 winds down, however, the era of general-purpose A.I. agents has failed to emerge. This fall, Andrej Karpathy, a co-founder of OpenAI, who left the company and started an A.I.-education project, described agents as “cognitively lacking” and said, “It’s just not working.” Gary Marcus, a longtime critic of tech-industry hype, recently wrote on his Substack that “AI Agents have, so far, mostly been a dud.” This gap between prediction and reality matters. Fluent chatbots and reality-bending video generators are impressive, but they cannot, on their own, usher in a world in which machines take over many of our activities. If the major A.I. companies cannot deliver broadly useful agents, then they may be unable to deliver on their promises of an A.I.-powered future.\n\nThis setup turns out to excel at automating software development. Most of the actions required to create or modify a computer program can be implemented by entering a limited set of commands into a text-based terminal. These commands tell a computer to navigate a file system, add or update text in source files, and, if needed, compile human-readable code into machine-readable bits. This is an ideal setting for L.L.M.s. “The terminal interface is text-based, and that is the domain that language models are based on,” Alex Shaw, the co-creator of Terminal-Bench, a popular tool used to evaluate coding agents, told me.\n\nMore generalized assistants, of the sort envisioned by Altman, would require agents to leave the comfortable constraints of the terminal. Since most of us complete computer tasks by pointing and clicking, an A.I. that can “join the workforce” probably needs to know how to use a mouse—a surprisingly difficult goal. The Times recently reported on a string of new startups that have been building “shadow sites”—replicas of popular webpages, like those of United Airlines and Gmail, on which A.I. can analyze how humans use a cursor. In July, OpenAI released ChatGPT Agent, an early version of a bot that can use a web browser to complete tasks, but one review noted that “even simple actions like clicking, selecting elements, and searching can take the agent several seconds—or even minutes.” At one point, the tool got stuck for nearly a quarter of an hour trying to select a price from a real-estate site’s drop-down menu.",

    "description": "A new alloy combines the best of the refractory metals with cutting-edge engineering. The material might just revolutionize modern manufacturing.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nA new alloy combines the best of the refractory metals with cutting-edge engineering.\n\nEven these extremely tough metals can be made to deform and show bands of adjustment.\n\nThese kink bands add strength through subtle shifts in the crystal structure, reducing brittleness.\n\nIn recently published research, scientists have revealed a special alloy that could change the game with its combination of temperature tolerance, resistance to wear, and previously unheard of fracture toughness.\n\nHow do you make one alloy that has it all? The secret is a feature called a kink band, where the material naturally forms a certain way as it is heated and treated. As the saying goes, sometimes our flaws can lead to our greatest strengths. Turns out that’s also true for exotic alloys.\n\nMany metals are soft in their pure form—or, at least, softer than we’d like them to be for applications like manufacturing and heavy machinery. Long ago, humans realized they could combine two metals into one alloy (like bronze) and get results that were tougher, held a sharp edge better, and lasted longer.\n\nWhy are alloys so strong? Well, each element has its own atomic mass and particle size. Think about a pure metal like a game of Jenga. When you push on a block (or deform your metal), you know how that block is going to move. But in an alloy, your Jenga tower is built from blocks of different sizes, meaning it’s much harder to simply “push” (deform) them out of place. There are fewer of the neat lines that are prone to breakage.\n\nIn this paper, researchers from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and a handful of west coast universities collaborated on a new refractory alloy. Refractory—used colloquially to mean stubborn—in this case means an alloy that is extremely tolerant of very high heat. They’re made by combining metals from the fifth and sixth period of the periodic table of elements: molybdenum, niobium, tungsten, tangalum, and rhenium.\n\nThese elements have some of the highest melting points in the known periodic table. They also have very high hardness among the pure metals—although if we’re talking about materials in general, diamond still leaves them in the dust. That means when alloyed in a particular way, these metals (along with a few others with high melting points, like titanium and iridium) can become even more resistant to heat and wear, forming the family of refractory alloys.\n\nThere’s just a few problems. The same toughness and hardness that defines the refractory alloys often means they’re literally too hard to work with, with low ductility and a high likelihood of fracture. In other words, if you’re trying to metalwork a refractory alloy into any kind of shape, it will break instead of bend. We needed to find a middle ground where a very hard refractory alloy could take a hit and deform in the desired way rather than fracturing.\n\nTo do this, the Berkeley Lab scientists “specifically engineered” an alloy of niobium, tantalum, titanium, and hafnium, and formed kink bands in the metal. Inside a solid material like an alloy, kinks and jogs are terms referring to types of flaws that affect the alloy’s structure. Their details are more scientific, but a kink in a power cable or a street that jogs over a bit give you the intuitive idea. While the alloy forms, its crystal structures move around just enough to create these “stretch marks” or seams that show a change in crystal orientation.\n\nIn cables, a kink is often a sign of damage or unusual wear. In the crystals that we use as gemstones, a kink band might ruin the desired sparkly effect by disrupting how light passes through the material. But in the alloy, researchers found that the kink bands resulted from dislocation tolerance—meaning deformability without breaking. The particles in the alloy were able to adapt to a space where the crystals had shifted around, and those bands of adaptation made the results stronger.\n\n“Our work shows that contrary to conventional understanding, complex concentrated refractory alloys can possess exceptional fracture toughness across extreme temperature ranges, even in the cryogenic regime,” the scientists conclude. The next step is more research, since this is just one exploratory paper.\n\nBut in a world waiting on new technologies like quantum computing and nuclear fusion, the cryogenic regime—where materials are cooled to near absolute zero—is vital. The stronger we can make those materials, the better.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "Toyota is recalling 51,644 Camrys due to an issue with their power inverter assembly that could cause the hybrid sedans to lose power.\n\nThe issue affects 2025 to 2026 Camry models, and it also involves 3761 copies of the 2026 Toyota Corolla Cross Hybrid.\n\nToyota says it's currently working on a fix and plans to notify owners of the issue by February 13, 2026.\n\nToyota is known for its plentiful hybrid options, but one of its most popular models is part of a notable recall. Toyota says that 51,644 versions of the recently refreshed Camry could lose power due to a defective inverter assembly. This issue also involves 3761 copies of the Toyota Corolla Cross.\n\nAccording to a document submitted earlier this month to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the recall affects 2025–2026 Camry models and the 2026 Corolla Cross. The issue stems from the inverter that converts power from the hybrid system's battery to the electric motor, as a bolt inside the assembly could come loose and create an open circuit, which could either cause the vehicle to go into limp mode or lose power. Along with activating a warning light, the loose bolt could lead to a short circuit in certain situations that could cause a fire.\n\nToyota estimates that 34 incidents related to the problem have been reported, along with 15 warranty claims, which caused the company to issue a voluntary recall. While it doesn't currently have a fix for the situation, Toyota says it will inform owners about the necessary steps when those details become available. Meanwhile, the automaker will notify owners about the recall by mail by February 13, 2026. Any eventual repair costs will be covered under warranty.\n\nCar and Driver’s 10 Best Cars through the Decades\n\nLightning Lap Legends: Chevrolet Camaro vs. Ford Mustang!",

    "description": "Ukraine has used its pioneering naval drones to hit Russian targets like expensive warships. Now it has a growing fleet designed to fight on rivers.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's naval drones are now targeting Russia in waters other than the open ocean.\n\nIt recently unveiled drones designed for use on rivers, including the Barracuda drone.\n\nThe unit that operates the Barracuda said it was able to destroy a Russian base and boat.\n\nThe naval drones that Ukraine has used to hammer Russia's Black Sea Fleet are now targeting Russia in new waterways.\n\nThe 40th Coastal Defense Brigade of Ukraine's 30th Marine Corps said last week that an uncrewed \"Barrauda\" drone was able to penetrate Russian positions, leave mines, and strike Russian targets, damaging a Russian logistical base and a boat equipped with a machine gun.\n\nThe strike comes as Ukraine fields more naval drones designed to hunt Russian targets in smaller bodies of water.\n\nThe brigade shared combat footage that appears to have been filmed by a camera on the drone. The uncrewed vessel can be seen navigating a wide body of water before moving into a much narrower, brown-water channel.\n\nThe newly released video shows a camouflaged boat at a base, and then aerial footage shows a large explosion followed by images of a destroyed building along the water.\n\nThe footage indicates the attack did not take place on the open ocean, as many of Ukraine’s naval drone strikes have, but in a confined inland waterway; Ukrainian outlet Militarnyi reported that the strike occurred on the Dnipro River.\n\nUkraine has used drones across land, air, and sea to gather information on the enemy and strike Russian targets, and its naval drones have helped to weaken Russia's Black Sea Fleet. Ukraine doesn't have a proper navy with powerful ships, but the much cheaper drones have helped damage Russia's expensive warships, even forcing Russia to relocate many vessels further away.\n\nHowever, using drones in river environments or smaller bodies of water is a relatively new development for Ukraine, opening up a new range of targets for newly developed technology.\n\nDedicated drones for those areas, such as the Barracuda or others like the Ursula or Black Widow 2, are newer technology compared to systems like the Sea Baby or Magura drones for open ocean. Ukraine is constantly upgrading its naval drones and creating new ones.\n\nThe Barracuda drone was first showcased by the 40th Separate Coastal Defence Brigade in September.\n\nThe 40th Separate Coastal Defence Brigade showcased the Barracuda in September, saying the drone is designed to \"perform tasks that humans cannot,\" including evacuating people from coastal areas and delivering ammunition to dangerous areas.\n\nIt said a month earlier that the drone is modular, making it easy to swap in different types of weapons, from mines to grenade launchers. It also shared that it uses artificial intelligence, though details on that are limited.\n\nA special unit with the same name designed and launched the Barracuda and is the only one in the Ukrainian military operating the drone right now.\n\nIn recent months, Ukraine has said the Barracuda has destroyed a Russian logistics vessel and its crew and used naval mines to block channels between islands.\n\nDrones are being used \n\nDrones give Ukraine a key advantage because they can be produced domestically and at a fraction of the cost of many traditional weapons, creating an asymmetric threat to expensive assets such as Black Sea Fleet warships or T-90 tanks on the battlefield. Ukraine’s defense minister said last week that the armed forces expect to receive nearly 3 million FPV drones by the end of the year, most of them made at home — though Russia is also rapidly developing and fielding similar technology.\n\nWorried about the potential for a future conflict with Russia, much of the West is closely watching Ukraine's tactics and new war tech. Naval drones are one of the innovations Ukraine has said it is willing to export to partner nations.\n\nNATO allies and defense companies are working on the technology, particularly in the Baltic Sea, which is shared by a host of NATO members and Russia. The US military is also exploring the potential of these weapon systems.\n\nUS Army Gen. Christopher Cavoli, NATO's supreme allied commander in Europe, called the way that Ukraine was able to move Russia's navy with drones an \"arbiter of things in the future.\" He said that \"there seems to be a big role for unmanned maritime systems into the future.\"",

    "fullText": "Attorney Alex Spiro wrote a letter to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, urging him to stop a proposed billionaire tax.\n\nSpiro said his clients would \"permanently relocate\" if the measure were to become law.\n\nWhile Spiro did not say which clients he was referencing, he has previously represented well known billionaires and celebrities.\n\nA proposed billionaire tax in California has the wealthy threatening to flee, according to a letter written by power lawyer Alex Spiro to Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nIn a December 11 letter that was obtained by Business Insider, Spiro lays out his opposition to the proposed tax on behalf of his clients, whom he calls \"California residents who would be subject to the proposed Billionaire Tax Act.\"\n\n\"It will trigger an exodus of capital and innovation from California,\" Spiro wrote. \"Our clients have made clear they will permanently relocate if subjected to this tax.\"\n\nThe measure proposes that California residents with assets exceeding $1 billion be subject to a one-time 5% tax on the value of their assets. If the proposal receives enough signatures, it will appear on the state ballot in November 2026. If passed, it would apply retroactively to all California residents as of January 1, 2026.\n\nWhile Newsom has said he is against the tax and would \"fight\" it, he would not have the ability to veto it if it were to pass as a ballot measure.\n\nSeveral wealthy Californians, including venture capitalist Peter Thiel and Google cofounder Larry Page, have considered shrinking their presence in California, according to a New York Times report. Representatives for Page and Thiel did not respond to Business Insider when asked if they were represented by Spiro.\n\nOver the weekend, billionaire Palmer Luckey took to X to voice his opposition to the measure.\n\n\"I made my money from my first company, paid hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes on it,\" the Anduril cofounder wrote. \"Now me and my cofounders have to somehow come up with billions of dollars in cash.\"\n\nWhile it's not clear which clients the lawyer was referencing in his letter to Newsom, Spiro's client roster in the past has included billionaires and A-listers.

    "description": "Calls are growing for the UK to new rules for younger drivers - but what are they?",
    "fullText": "Ministers are expected to resist calls for a major overhaul of driving qualifications when they unveil their latest plans to improve road safety.\n\nCampaigners have argued that replacing Britain's current driving test regime could prevent thousands of injuries and deaths on the nation’s roads every year.\n\nThe existing ‘one-and-done’ system means newly qualified drivers face the same rules of the road as other more experienced motorists as soon as they pass their test.\n\nHowever, a growing number of experts are calling on Britain to introduce a so-called \"progressive\" or \"graduated\" system, similar to those used in countries such as Australia and the Republic of Ireland, which enforce tighter restrictions on new drivers.\n\nThe AA has estimated such a chance could slash the annual number of people hurt or killed in incidents by as much as two-fifths.\n\nEarlier this month, Simon Foster, police and crime commissioner (PCC) for the West Midlands, became the latest figure to demand the government make changes, calling progressive driving licences “proven, proportionate and urgently needed”.\n\nHowever, transport chiefs are expected to prioritise ‘other measures’ when the government publishes its upcoming Road Safety Strategy.\n\nA Department for Transport spokesperson told Yahoo News in response to Foster's comments: “Whilst we are not considering graduated driving licences, we absolutely recognise that young people are disproportionately victims of tragic incidents on our roads and continue to tackle this through our THINK! Campaign.\n\n“We are considering other measures to address this problem and protect young drivers, as part of our upcoming strategy for road safety – the first in over a decade.”\n\nCurrently, all drivers in England, Wales or Scotland are subject to the same rules whether it has been days or decades since they passed their practical driving test.\n\nNewly qualified motorists can choose to display a green ‘P plate’ if they wish, to indicate their lack of experience to other road users.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, an amber ‘R plate’ must be shown for the first 12 months after qualifying and speed restrictions are enforced.\n\nWhile a ‘graduated’ or ‘progressive’ driving licence could take several forms, it would likely see restrictions such as a top speed, number of passengers and the types of roads they can drive on.\n\nThese would be gradually lifted based on factors such as age, competence behind the wheel and driving experience.\n\nThis has been backed by the AA, which believes it could cut the number of serious accidents involving young drivers.\n\nLast year, the organisation’s president, Edmund King, said: \"The AA believes we need a system of graduated learning with a logbook whereby all learners need to demonstrate their skills on all types of roads and crucially on rural roads where 71% of new driver fatal crashes occur, and in different weather conditions and different times of day or night.”\n\nThe Republic of Ireland requires drivers to complete a two-year probation period, during which they must display ‘N plates’ and comply with lower drink-drive limits than more experienced road users.\n\nIn Australia, new drivers are banned from driving between certain hours at night and have limitations on the number of passengers they can carry.\n\nMotorists in New Zealand go through a three-step process, offering ‘learner’, ‘restricted’ and ‘full’ licences.\n\nThe government has seemingly ruled out any immediate prospect of overhauling driving licence rules in its upcoming Road Safety Strategy, saying instead it would focus on “other measures” to improve highway safety.\n\nThis could include tougher penalties for driving without insurance or failing to wear a seatbelt.\n\nNew research has also suggested a softening in attitudes towards drink-driving among the young.\n\nThe policy is expected to run until 2030, suggesting graduated or progressive licences are unlikely to be considered before then.\n\nThe strategy was expected to be published in the autumn, but it is still not known when the policy is likely to be released.\n\nThe approach has widespread backing.\n\nIn summer 2025, campaign group Protect Young Drivers was launched, a coalition of MPs, emergency services, insurers, academics, charities, campaigners and bereaved families.\n\nOrganisations signed up to the politically neutral, evidence-based approach include the National Police Chiefs' Council, the National Fire Chiefs' Council, the RAC, the AA, Brake, RoadPeace and IAM RoadSmart.\n\nMotoring organisation the AA has previously backed graduated driving licences, with its president, Edmund King, saying: \"We owe it to the next generation to introduce positive measures that will help give them healthy and prosperous lives.”\n\nThe RAC has also said it believes this could “help save lives on the country’s roads”.\n\nIt has also been supported by victims’ charities, such as Brake, which has argued such a scheme could save 4,471 casualties and £224m every year, just based on the impact it could have on drivers aged 17-19.\n\nIn November 2025, the family of Josh Atkins, who died in a car crash when he was 17, spoke about the need for a new system.\n\nCorey Owen Cooper was jailed for five years for causing the death of Atkins by dangerous driving after causing the crash the day after he passed his driving test.\n\nHis family have called for Britain to adopt a graduated driving licence system. “Young and inexperienced drivers need more support, more education, and more accountability before they are given full driving licence privileges,\" they said in a statement after Cooper's conviction.\n\n“This is not about punishment, it is about prevention. If such a system was in place, Josh would still be with us today, still living his life.”\n\nThe policy also appears to have clear public support, with a survey of more than 7,000 people by pollster YouGov showing a clear majority in favour.\n\nHowever, the government has so far refused to consider such a scheme, with Lilian Greenwood, the minister for local transport, telling a House of Commons debate early this year she hoped to improve safety without “unfairly penalising young drivers”.\n\nIn its Roadmap to Tackle Insurance Costs document, the Association of British Insurers (ABI) said the “adoption of graduated driving licences” has the potential to lower premiums.\n\nThe RAC has also suggested it believes a licensing overhaul could see young drivers in particular pay less for their car insurance.\n\nHowever, it also noted this is not certain and that other products – such as ‘black box’ insurance which tracks driving and qualifications such as the Pass Plus scheme – can already help reduce costs.",

She was last seen on a neighbor’s security camera shortly before 7 a.m. on the 11000 block of Caspian Spring, near San Antonio, CBS affiliate KENS5 reported.\n\nOlmos told the Bexar County Sheriff’s Office that her daughter regularly takes morning walks, and that she became concerned when “Camila did not return within a reasonable period of time,” according to ABC News. Mendoza Olmos did not take her phone with her.\n\n“I called her cellphone, but the cellphone was there on the bed and it was turned off,” Olmos told KENS5. “I put it to charge and went out to look for her. I thought I would find her like other times, walking, and we would come home together.”\n\nThe video footage from that morning shows an individual believed to be Mendoza Olmos searching inside her vehicle for an unidentified item before the footage ends, according to the Bexar County Sheriff’s Office. Investigators believe she left the area on foot, as her car was still at her home.\n\nMendoza Olmos, who is 5’4” and 110 pounds with brown hair and eyes, was last seen wearing a blue-and-black hoodie, baby blue pajama bottoms and white shoes, and is believed to be carrying only her car key and possibly her driver’s license.\n\nBexar County Sheriff Javier Salazar told ABC News that deputies and volunteers have been searching around the clock as they believe that Olmos is in “imminent danger.”\n\nMultiple agencies are assisting with the investigation, including the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, the latter of which is monitoring border crossings and international travel. San Antonio is about 160 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n“We definitely don’t want to miss anything,” Salazar told ABC News. “The ground search is somewhat limited to a couple of square miles. We’re also not ruling out that this case may take us outside the borders of the continental United States.”\n\nMendoza Olmos, a U.S. citizen, was not detained by ICE, Salazar said, adding that authorities are also investigating kidnapping, human trafficking and whether Mendoza Olmos left on her own accord.\n\nMendoza Olmos recently went through a breakup, however Salazar said that the split was mutual and that authorities found no indication of foul play. Those close to Mendoza Olmos are cooperating with the investigation.\n\nThe Sheriff’s office is asking anyone with information regarding Mendoza Olmos’s whereabouts to call the Bexar County Sheriff’s Office at (210) 335-6000 or contact the Bexar County Missing Persons Unit at missingpersons@bexar.org.",

The uncrewed vessel can be seen navigating a wide body of water before moving into a much narrower, brown-water channel.\n\nA post shared by 40 окрема бригада берегової оборони (@40obrbo)\n\nThe newly released video shows a camouflaged boat at a base, and then aerial footage shows a large explosion followed by images of a destroyed building along the water.\n\nThe footage indicates the attack did not take place on the open ocean, as many of Ukraine’s naval drone strikes have, but in a confined inland waterway; Ukrainian outlet Militarnyi reported that the strike occurred on the Dnipro River.\n\nUkraine has used drones across land, air, and sea to gather information on the enemy and strike Russian targets, and its naval drones have helped to weaken Russia's Black Sea Fleet. Ukraine doesn't have a proper navy with powerful ships, but the much cheaper drones have helped damage Russia's expensive warships, even forcing Russia to relocate many vessels further away.\n\nHowever, using drones in river environments or smaller bodies of water is a relatively new development for Ukraine, opening up a new range of targets for newly developed technology.\n\nDedicated drones for those areas, such as the Barracuda or others like the Ursula or Black Widow 2, are newer technology compared to systems like the Sea Baby or Magura drones for open ocean. Ukraine is constantly upgrading its naval drones and creating new ones.\n\nThe Barracuda drone was first showcased by the 40th Separate Coastal Defence Brigade in September.\n\nThe 40th Separate Coastal Defence Brigade showcased the Barracuda in September, saying the drone is designed to \"perform tasks that humans cannot,\" including evacuating people from coastal areas and delivering ammunition to dangerous areas.\n\nIt said a month earlier that the drone is modular, making it easy to swap in different types of weapons, from mines to grenade launchers. It also shared that it uses artificial intelligence, though details on that are limited.\n\nA special unit with the same name designed and launched the Barracuda and is the only one in the Ukrainian military operating the drone right now.\n\nIn recent months, Ukraine has said the Barracuda has destroyed a Russian logistics vessel and its crew and used naval mines to block channels between islands.\n\nDrones are being used \n\nDrones give Ukraine a key advantage because they can be produced domestically and at a fraction of the cost of many traditional weapons, creating an asymmetric threat to expensive assets such as Black Sea Fleet warships or T-90 tanks on the battlefield. Ukraine’s defense minister said last week that the armed forces expect to receive nearly 3 million FPV drones by the end of the year, most of them made at home — though Russia is also rapidly developing and fielding similar technology.\n\nWorried about the potential for a future conflict with Russia, much of the West is closely watching Ukraine's tactics and new war tech. Naval drones are one of the innovations Ukraine has said it is willing to export to partner nations.\n\nNATO allies and defense companies are working on the technology, particularly in the Baltic Sea, which is shared by a host of NATO members and Russia. The US military is also exploring the potential of these weapon systems.\n\nUS Army Gen. Christopher Cavoli, NATO's supreme allied commander in Europe, called the way that Ukraine was able to move Russia's navy with drones an \"arbiter of things in the future.\" He said that \"there seems to be a big role for unmanned maritime systems into the future.\"",

    "description": "Gregor Konzett quit his dream job at Google and gave up his US visa to be part of a startup accelerator program. Here's how he took a calculated risk.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Gregor Konzett, a 27-year-old former Google employee based in London. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I got relocated to work out of Google's Mountain View headquarters in 2024, it was a dream come true.\n\nI was raised in a small village in Austria, but I always dreamed of living in Silicon Valley. As a child who was excited about tech, I wanted to be where innovation happened.\n\nMy team was based in California, but I was working from London. Not even a year into my job, I was asking if I could be transferred.\n\nTwo years after getting hired as a software engineer, Google transferred me to Silicon Valley. Then, a year after that, I quit. I packed up my bags and moved back to London in just two weeks to participate in a startup accelerator program. It was worth the risk, even in this difficult job market.\n\nI joined Google in 2022 as a software engineer on the Google Pixel audio team. I enjoyed my job, but being in London, the physical distance turned minor questions into major delays. If I hit a blocker with a specific subsystem, I'd send a message and wait 24 hours for a reply due to time zone differences, or spend many late nights in chats with colleagues to unblock myself.\n\nAfter I was finally relocated to the Mountain View headquarters, living in the Bay Area was almost exactly as I had always imagined it from movies and TV. California is the most beautiful place I've ever been to, and being able to call it my home was incredible.\n\nIt was great to be part of an environment filled with so many other engineers. I remember going surfing with some people and just having the most Silicon Valley conversation ever about coding and deep tech. The only thing I didn't expect was that it's not this crazy, futuristic place. In reality, the infrastructure was just OK, and the internet speed wasn't even very reliable.\n\nThe work life at the Google headquarters was really nice. On average, it was a typical 9-to-5, and my team had a really great dynamic.\n\nFor the first few months, I was learning a lot, and everything ramped up quickly. My team gave me a lot of responsibility and trusted me to handle huge pieces of the system, which is amazing and rare for a company of its size.\n\nBeing in the office, I got to sit on the same floor as the teams building the specific subsystems I was coding for, and sit in meetings where product decisions were actually made. I could walk 10 feet, point at a whiteboard, and solve complex architectural issues in minutes. I learned \n\nHowever, after about a year, I felt like I had reached a natural ceiling in my work, and I wasn't learning much anymore. I wasn't super happy in my job, and my visa limited me from working on my own projects outside of Google, which was my real dream.\n\nOne of my closest friends got into a startup accelerator program in London and encouraged me to apply, with the plan of using it as an opportunity to cofound our own startup. When I got accepted with a start date only a month away, I knew I'd have to make a quick decision. I loved California, and leaving Google would mean leaving the country.\n\nThe job market has been terrible, and I questioned whether this was the right time to quit my job and potentially face unemployment. However, I felt confident in my technical background and having Google on my résumé, so I believed I could find another job.\n\nThe hardest part about deciding to quit was that it was objectively a really good job, and leaving meant giving up my path to a green card in the US. I was stuck in a dilemma: do I stay in a role I've outgrown for four, or potentially even more years, just to secure permanent residency, or do I quit to chase higher job satisfaction?\n\nI realized that staying for the sake of immigration meant stalling my career development.\n\nI figured now was the time to take a risk. I'm young and have a financial runway from my Google salary, and I don't have a mortgage to pay or a family to care for. So, I put in my two weeks at Google.\n\nIt's been a few months since I joined the program, and my friend and I are working on our startup, Vestry.ai, which fixes the observability gap for complex hardware. Our plan is to build while we're in the accelerator, get funding, and move back to California to live the startup life.\n\nCalifornia is ultimately the place to be for anything in the startup world. We want to be a part of the AI revolution, and that's just where you've got to be.\n\nI've been so busy with the program I haven't really had any time to think about whether I made the right choice, but I'm convinced I'm where I need to be.\n\nDo you have a story to share about quitting Big Tech? If so, please reach out to the reporter at tmartinelli@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "China says the drills are a stern warning to pro-independence forces, but they look a lot like a practice run.",
    "fullText": "Beijing is calling its massive war games around Taiwan this week a stern warning; however, they are also practice, offering insight into how China is thinking about a war for the island.\n\nThe big military exercise, \"Justice Mission-2025,\" that kicked off Monday is the latest large-scale Chinese drill aimed at preparing the People's Liberation Army for action such as bringing combined arms to bear against Taiwan, seizing control of the skies, isolating and assaulting the island, and combating foreign interference.\n\nChina mobilized its army, navy, air, and rocket forces for drills around Taiwan with a focus on combat readiness in the sea and air, blocking off key ports and areas, and what it said was \"all-dimensional deterrence outside the island chain.\"\n\nOn the southeast side of the island, China's military has been using bombers and anti-ship missiles against mock maritime targets, clearing the way for the navy's amphibious assault ships. The exercises, China's Eastern Theater Command said, are testing how well air and naval forces operate together. There was also an emphasis on eliminating targets at \"maximum range,\" key to cutting risk and keeping hostile forces at arm's length.\n\nTo the north and southwest of Taiwan, the Chinese military's destroyers, frigates, fighters, bombers, and drones, together with the long-range rocket forces, have been practicing coordinated seizure and dominance, pursuing training targets on land, at sea, and in the air, the way it might in a real fight.\n\nIn recent years, China has put greater emphasis on more realistic training.\n\nIn the air, Chinese fighters, airborne early warning aircraft, and electronic warfare planes have been training to effectively secure air superiority, while action at sea has been focused on defeating both surface ships and submarines.\n\n\"With vessels and aircraft approaching Taiwan island in close proximity from different directions,\" a command spokesperson said, \"troops of multiple services engage in joint assaults to test their joint operations capabilities.\"\n\nVideo shared by the Eastern Theater Command showed preparations for the drills, including trucks carrying missiles, fighter jets and other aircraft, and warship activity.\n\n🇨🇳 🇹🇼 🪖China holds large-scale combat exercises east of Taiwan\n\nThe drills held by the People's Liberation Army’s Eastern Theater Command were aimed at testing joint sea–air coordination, precise target detection, and rapid neutralization capabilities. pic.twitter.com/2veIz926ZJ\n\nThe training isn't entirely simulated and includes live-fire activities against mock targets. The live-fire exercises will take place in five maritime and airspace zones around Taiwan.\n\nChina's coast guard is also on patrol in the waters surrounding Taiwan. The island's defense ministry said on Monday afternoon that it had detected 14 Chinese navy warships and 14 coast guard vessels around Taiwan and outlying islands. Additionally, 89 aircraft, including J-10 and J-16 fighters, JH-7 fighter-bombers, and KJ-500 early warning and control planes, had been detected around Taiwan as well. None of the ships or planes violated Taiwan's territorial airspace or waters.\n\nTaiwan's defense ministry said that the island has been conducting its own rapid response drills amid the Chinese exercise.\n\nThe drills show how China's military plans to use its current forces in a coordinated attack, but in official releases, there were also indications about its future ambitions. On Monday, China released an artificial intelligence-made short video on a Taiwan fight.\n\nThe video showed various animals, like eagles and bees, transforming into uncrewed aerial vehicles, sea creatures becoming warships, and wolves turning into uncrewed ground robots. The AI-generated video, titled \"Joint Operations to Thwart 'Taiwan Independence' Attempts,\" also featured a pack of humanoid drones carrying rifles and walking through a war-torn city.\n\n🇨🇳 PLA Eastern Theater Command releases AI propaganda video 《联武群戈斩“独”道》(Joint Operations to Thwart ‘Taiwan Independence’ Attempts) https://t.co/gKUa2CanWJ pic.twitter.com/l0fUHtVVVp\n\nThe propaganda video, despite its artistic styling and the featuring of some technology not currently known to exist, suggests China is aiming for an integrated approach using a range of uncrewed systems and advanced capabilities, like submarines and warships and aircraft.\n\nCombining assets has been an important part of the latest military drills. Effectively integrating wide-ranging combat capabilities for combined arms warfare is a challenging feat though.",

    "description": "Beyoncé is officially a billionaire, according to Forbes. She joins wealthy musicians like Taylor Swift and Rihanna in the elite club.",
    "fullText": "Less than 10 years after Beyoncé famously sang, \"I just might be a Black Bill Gates in the making,\" she's been named a billionaire.\n\nBeyoncé's already-formidable net worth surged after a pair of successful tours: the 2023 Renaissance World Tour, which grossed nearly $600 million, and the 2025 Cowboy Carter Tour, which Forbes described as \"the most successful concert tour\" in the history of country music.\n\nIn addition to live performances and lucrative merchandise sales, Beyoncé has spent decades building her business empire. She founded Parkwood Entertainment in 2010, followed by a clothing line, Ivy Park, a hair-care brand, Cécred, and a whiskey label, SirDavis.\n\nNevertheless, as Forbes reports, the bulk of Beyoncé's fortune remains rooted in her music. Beyoncé controls the rights to her valuable album catalog, from 2003's \"Dangerously In Love\" to 2025's \"Cowboy Carter\" and beyond. All production costs for her music, documentaries, and concerts are handled in-house through Parkwood.\n\n\"When I decided to manage myself, it was important that I didn't go to some big management company,\" Beyoncé said while promoting her 2013 self-titled album. \"I felt like I wanted to follow the footsteps of Madonna and be a powerhouse and have my own empire and show other women when you get to this point in your career, you don't have to go sign with someone else and share your money and your success — you do it yourself.\"\n\nJay-Z has been pursuing mogul status for over three decades.\n\nThe East Coast rapper founded Roc-A-Fella Records in 1995. Since then, Jay-Z has started his own sports agency, Roc Nation Sports. He bought and sold the music streaming platform Tidal, netting himself $149 million, according to a 2021 Forbes report. He owns stakes in the Champagne brand Armand de Brignac and the Cognac brand D'Ussé. His umbrella company, Roc Nation, has inked a multimillion-dollar partnership with the NFL. The list goes on.\n\nAll that, in addition to his extremely popular discography, has contributed to his vast wealth. As of December 2025, Forbes estimates Jay-Z's net worth to be $2.5 billion, making him the richest musician on this list.\n\nBloomberg reported that Taylor Swift became a billionaire in October 2023. Forbes corroborated this report in April 2024, about halfway through her record-smashing Eras Tour. By the end of its two-year run, the Eras Tour became the first in history to gross $2 billion.\n\nSwift redistributed a significant portion of her touring profits to her crew, reportedly handing out $197 million in bonuses alone. She continued to donate millions to charitable organizations through 2025, including Feeding America, the American Heart Association, MusiCares, ACM Lifting Lives, and the CMA Foundation.\n\nUnlike many of her peers, Swift's wealth comes solely from her — she doesn't have any lucrative side hustles. Swift's sizable net worth estimates are largely based on the value of her musical catalog, which she owns outright. Swift's 12th studio album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" sold over 4 million copies in its debut week, smashing the single-week album sales record and finishing the year as the top-performing album on the Billboard 200 chart.\n\nAs of December 2025, Forbes estimated Swift's net worth to be $1.6 billion.\n\nIn September 2024, Bloomberg estimated Selena Gomez's net worth to be $1.3 billion, largely thanks to her makeup brand, Rare Beauty.\n\nHowever, Forbes has estimated Gomez's net worth to be roughly $700 million, citing reported cash flow issues with Wondermind, the startup Gomez cofounded in 2021 with her mother, Mandy Teefey, and entrepreneur Daniella Pierson.\n\nStill, Forbes reports, \"Gomez's biggest asset is her estimated 51% stake in Rare Beauty.\" The vegan and cruelty-free brand is widely recognized as one of Sephora's biggest money-makers and most popular celebrity beauty lines; the cult-favorite blush alone generated $70 million in 2022.\n\nIn addition to her success as a businesswoman, Gomez is a celebrated actor. She has been nominated for several Golden Globes for the hit Hulu comedy series, \"Only Murders in the Building.\" She was also nominated for a Golden Globe for her supporting role in the 2024 film \"Emilia Pérez.\"\n\nGomez executive produces many of her own projects, including \"Only Murders,\" HBO's \"Selena + Chef,\" and Disney Channel's \"Wizards Beyond Waverly Place,\" a sequel to the show that made Gomez famous as a teenager.\n\nGomez began releasing albums while starring on \"Wizards of Waverly Place\" via Disney's Hollywood Records. Since signing a new contract with Interscope in 2014, Gomez has released two solo albums and a handful of top-10 hits. Her latest album, \"I Said I Love You First,\" is a collaboration with her fiancé, Benny Blanco.\n\nOver 50 years after The Boss released his first album, \"Greetings from Asbury Park,\" the New Jersey legend was named a billionaire by Forbes. As of December 2025, Forbes estimates Bruce Springsteen's net worth to be $1.2 billion.\n\nAs Variety reported, much of Springsteen's wealth comes from the 2021 sale of his music catalog to Sony for $500 million.\n\nIn addition to that mega-sale, Springsteen is constantly on the road, earning money from his packed touring schedule with the E Street Band.\n\nForbes estimates Rihanna's net worth to be $1 billion.\n\nDespite Rihanna's decadelong reign as a hitmaker, she hasn't released an album since 2016's \"Anti,\" which means that most of her wealth is from her two eponymously named brands: Fenty Beauty, which she co-owns with the French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH, and Savage X Fenty, a lingerie brand.\n\nAfter its initial launch in 2017, Fenty Beauty has since expanded to encompass Fenty Skin, Fenty Hair, and Fenty Fragrance. Rihanna was also named Puma's creative director in 2014.",

    "description": "While aboard Royal Caribbean's Wonder of the Seas, I learned the hard way that the bumpiest rooms on a cruise ship are at the front.",
    "fullText": "The first night of my first cruise was terrifying. The floor trembled beneath me. I was startled by booming noises coming from the decks above and below mine. Was that furniture falling, sliding, and crashing into walls?\n\nI sat stiffly on the couch at midnight, determined to stay awake and prepared for disaster. I read the emergency instructions over and over for what felt like hours until I accidentally fell asleep.\n\nWhen I woke up, I rushed out the door to ensure everything was all right. As seemingly unfazed cruisers filled the buffet and lined up for the water slides, I realized I'd experienced a normal night at sea.\n\nThis was back in April 2022, when I booked a room on one of the largest cruise ships in the world, Royal Caribbean's 18-deck Wonder of the Seas.\n\nFor $2,000, I spent seven nights in a 179-square-foot ocean-view stateroom at the very front of deck eight. It was a mid-tier room — a step above the windowless interior staterooms, a step below staterooms with a balcony, and two steps below a suite.\n\nAfter my first rocky night aboard the ship, I wondered whether everyone had the same experience. So, I talked to some fellow passengers who were seasoned cruisers. They told me that the front of the ship is one of the worst places to be if you're prone to seasickness. They said that higher decks in the middle of the ship feel calmer and more stable.\n\nSince my room on the 18-deck ship was situated at the front of the eighth floor, I felt constant motion in my room. As someone who gets motion sickness from the slightest movement of bathwater, this spoiled many aspects of my first cruise.\n\nSome nights were rockier than others. On the roughest nights, I heard and felt a similar sensation to thunder beneath me every few minutes. Loud thumps and heavy vibrations in my room sounded like large pieces of furniture colliding.\n\nDuring the days at sea, it was especially challenging for me to eat and participate in activities. And I didn't feel rested for my excursions at port stops, which included hikes in the sun.\n\nCruise passengers prone to motion sickness should book a room in the middle of the ship to feel the least amount of rocking.\n\nI wish I'd researched how the location of a cabin can affect the amount of motion you feel while the ship is moving before booking my cruise. Next time, I'd choose a room in the middle of the ship.",

    "description": "Family scapegoats, often blamed for larger family issues, can struggle with boundaries and trust",
    "fullText": "On the surface, a family scapegoat often looks as if they're the problem child.\n\nThey might be the college dropout in a legacy of Ivy Leaguers or the introverted gamer in a family of outgoing athletes. Sometimes, they're just the foil to their golden-child sibling; more aloof or less financially successful.\n\nThese are the black sheep that some parents seek therapy to \"fix.\" However, the issue usually lies in the family dynamic itself, not the individual child, Annie Wright, a licensed marriage and family therapist in California, told Business Insider.\n\n\"There's a family systems issue, but they're pointing to one person as the scapegoat,\" Wright said. Behind the scenes, one spouse could be having an affair, the parents could be having explosive fights, and the marriage could be breaking down. By being assigned blame for the entire family's dysfunction, family scapegoats become \"the person who holds the unconscious collective burden of the family.\"\n\nWright shared some signs you might be the scapegoat of your family, even if you do your best to fit in.\n\nScapegoats don't always feel like they're underachieving in the family. Some might feel the opposite: in a family that enforces more rigid gender roles, Wright said, you might be the black sheep if you're the first woman to go to college or work as a CEO.\n\nThe point is that scapegoats don't fit in. They're usually \"the person who acts antithetical to the norms of the family,\" she said. Simply doing things differently can get you branded as a family outsider.\n\nNot everyone responds the same way to being the family scapegoat. Some might even cycle through different stages, Wright said.\n\n\"At the far end of the spectrum, they really embrace that identity,\" she said, noting that some people lean into the black sheep label and continually try to rebel against their family.\n\nOn the other end, \"people can fight tooth and nail to fit in after the very painful experience of being rejected by a family system,\" she said.\n\nAnd between those two extremes, many people teeter between both, going through periods of withdrawal or fawning for approval.\n\nFamily dynamics can shape all other relationships, from romantic partnerships to friendships, Wright said.\n\nFamily scapegoats may experience social challenges such as \"feeling like they can trust others, feeling like it's safe to be themselves, feeling like they can assert themselves and have that be OK,\" Wright said.\n\nThey might hold back in relationships, fearing yet another rejection.\n\nIt's common to be drawn to what feels familiar, so family scapegoats might unconsciously seek out relationships where they still feel like the ones taking all the blame.\n\n\"If at some level you had a family system that othered you, you might be drawn to partners or friends who are critical of the way you are,\" Wright said. This is doubly so if their parents were vocally and frequently critical of them.\n\nAs painful as it can be to find yourself a family scapegoat, Wright said it's the beginning of a new path. You can alter the dynamics in your relationships, including those within your family, once you start to realize that you deserve better.",

    "fullText": "\"It's one of those products that's truly an experience,\" said Blessed Little Bungalow's Amber Guyton. People love how oversized and comfortable it is.\n\nIt helps that they may have seen it and sat on it in person. Diners at RH's rooftop restaurant have to first make their way through the showroom. \"The Cloud Sofa's everywhere,\" said Guyton.\n\nAnd it is as comfortable as it looks. \"It is like sitting on a cloud,\" said Studio London Co.'s Travis London. \"I mean, the sofa is basically one huge pillow.\"\n\nLondon said mimicking the pillows is the most important future. \"It has huge pillow backs\" with down filling, he said, so if you want that softness, that's what you should look for.\n\nIf you don't want to get a whole new couch, you could look into new pillows for your existing one instead. \"By doing that, you are adding more of the bounce factor and the comfortability,\" said London. \"So that is a great way to do it on a budget.\"\n\nMore generally, though, London said he likes his own RH sofa because it's lasted a long time, and he's updated it with new fabric as his tastes change. \"If you have good bones in a sofa, you can constantly reupholster the sofa throughout its lifetime,\" he said.\n\nThe deeper seat and 18.5-inch height of the Cloud Sofa's cushions might not be for everyone, said Guyton.\n\n\"The female clients I have, they don't wanna feel like a little kid with their feet dangling off the sofa,\" she said. People with mobility or joint issues may want something higher and less deep as well.\n\nThen there's the white or linen color you often see on the Cloud couch. \"You definitely have to be mindful of that with shedding pets and kids and markers and all of that,\" said Guyton. If you're looking for an everyday sofa, you might want to go with a darker color. Otherwise, you may end up with a comfy couch you don't actually feel comfortable sitting in, she said.\n\nBoth London and Guyton say looking at consumer reviews is crucial, especially if they include images of the couch in their home.\n\nThe first thing to pay attention to is how people describe the comfort, said Guyton. \"If I can't take a comfortable nap on my sofa, then I'm not going to invest in it,\" she said. You'll also want to pay attention to measurements, including width, seat depth, and seat height.\n\nSome retailers also provide information on how much wear and tear a sofa can withstand. \"Look at the Wyzenbeek test on a fabric's durability,\" said Paige Gray of Paige Gray Studios. \"The higher the better, but for upholstery, I wouldn't dip below 30,000 for lightly used pieces and 50,000 for more heavily utilized sofas.\"\n\nThen, London said, look for a retailer with a really good return policy. That way, if you don't like it or it doesn't fit, you can send it back with minimal hassle.\n\nMost companies are able to offer an estimated delivery window of when your couch will arrive.  Some of the couches on this list can ship and be delivered as soon as two or three weeks, while custom or made-to-order options can take upward of three to four months.\n\nGuyton said it's worth the wait to get what you want. \"You don't wanna settle for something just to fill the space,\" she said. \"You wanna know that it's going to stand the test of time.\"",

    "fullText": "A proposed billionaire tax in California has the wealthy threatening to flee, according to a letter written by power lawyer Alex Spiro to Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nIn a December 11 letter that was obtained by Business Insider, Spiro lays out his opposition to the proposed tax on behalf of his clients, whom he calls \"California residents who would be subject to the proposed Billionaire Tax Act.\"\n\n\"It will trigger an exodus of capital and innovation from California,\" Spiro wrote. \"Our clients have made clear they will permanently relocate if subjected to this tax.\"\n\nThe measure proposes that California residents with assets exceeding $1 billion be subject to a one-time 5% tax on the value of their assets. If the proposal receives enough signatures, it will appear on the state ballot in November 2026. If passed, it would apply retroactively to all California residents as of January 1, 2026.\n\nWhile Newsom has said he is against the tax and would \"fight\" it, he would not have the ability to veto it if it were to pass as a ballot measure.\n\nSeveral wealthy Californians, including venture capitalist Peter Thiel and Google cofounder Larry Page, have considered shrinking their presence in California, according to a New York Times report. Representatives for Page and Thiel did not respond to Business Insider when asked if they were represented by Spiro.\n\nOver the weekend, billionaire Palmer Luckey took to X to voice his opposition to the measure.\n\n\"I made my money from my first company, paid hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes on it,\" the Anduril cofounder wrote. \"Now me and my cofounders have to somehow come up with billions of dollars in cash.\"\n\nWhile it's not clear which clients the lawyer was referencing in his letter to Newsom, Spiro's client roster in the past has included billionaires and A-listers.

    "fullText": "Food can get expensive, which means it's as important as ever to seek out good value with every purchase — even the croissant you have with your morning coffee.\n\nJust ask Camari Mick, the executive pastry chef at The Musket Room, who's also a partner at Raf's.\n\nMick knows her way around a bakery. She grew up visiting local shops and then studied the art of pastry in fine-dining restaurants across New York City. At Raf's, Mick turns out breads, croissants, and more for the restaurant's daytime bakery while leading the rest of the pastry program.\n\nDubbed NYC's dessert doyenne, the chef has developed her own set of red flags to look out for whenever she visits high-end bakeries.\n\nHere's how you can tell if you're at a spot that's serving high-quality products.\n\nThe first thing Mick does when she walks into a high-end bakery is study the classics. If she sees croissants, she'll look at the plain variety, taking note of the folds that make up the pastry's lamination.\n\nSome great bakeries will have croissants with layers that look perfectly aligned, others might take on a more rustic feel and seem more obviously hand-rolled. Both are welcome characteristics, Mick says.\n\nBut it's a bad sign if the lamination is \"very thick, or small, or not uniform,\" she told Business Insider. And if the croissants look perfectly machine-made, something may not be right in the kitchen.\n\nMick also looks at the color of the croissants, which can clue you into how they may taste. If it's too blonde on the outside, it may not have much flavor inside.\n\nSimilarly, she says, a pastry probably won't be super flaky if it looks as if it was \"sweating on itself\" after being covered while hot, and you can see its layers are wrinkly.\n\nOverall, Mick says, if it doesn't look as if love has been put into the pastries, she \"probably will only just grab a coffee.\"\n\nMick says high-end bakeries should only be selling fresh bread.\n\nIdeally, you should touch the bread to see whether it's too hard. If that's not an option, there are telltale signs a loaf could be subpar.\n\n\"If you were looking at any bread and it looks super voluptuous and almost fresh out of the oven, you're good to go,\" she told BI. \"But if you see that the bread is already wrapped, whether it be in plastic or paper, it's probably an indicator that it was wrapped warm and is not going to be good.\"\n\nMick says fresh bread needs room to breathe, and wrapping it even while it's only slightly warm will cause it to steam itself, potentially making it soggy.\n\nBefore she even steps into a bakery, Mick may turn to Instagram for visuals.\n\nFirst, she'll comb through the location tag for any given bakery, keeping an eye out for whatever item she was hoping to order.\n\nShe tries to see whether the baked good looks the same in all of the photos shared by diners. If it looks different every few pictures, she's probably not going to order it because it's unlikely to be very good, or the quality may vary depending on the batch.\n\nAnd when you're going to be spending a chunk of change at a pricier bakery, you don't want quality to be left up to chance.\n\nThe pastry chef says her understanding of chemistry also makes her hesitant to buy certain pastries that aren't made to order.\n\n\"You know that a crispy something filled with a moist, wet filling is going to be soggy after sitting for, like, 10 minutes,\" Mick said.\n\nFor example, a bakery that fills cannoli shells and leaves them in the case until they're purchased raises some concerns.\n\nLook out for flies around the pastry case, Mick warns.\n\n\"If you see any type of fly problem or any kind of insect infestation in the case, be sure it's everywhere,\" she told BI.\n\nYou may even want to peek into the bakery's bathroom before placing an order.\n\nShe added: \"I'm a big believer on if their bathroom is messy, their kitchen is messy.\"\n\nThis story was originally published on April 3, 2024, and most recently updated on December 29, 2025.",

    "title": "What Is Zone 2 Cardio, and How Do I Actually Do It?",
    "description": "If you have the time for it, \"LISS cardio\" is a cheat code for fitness gains.",
    "fullText": "A healthy dose of cardio is an important part of your exercise routine, and for a lot of us, \"zone 2\" cardio is going to make up a big chunk of that. Low-intensity cardio—sometimes called LISS or “zone 2”—used to be an underrated form of exercise. It's super trendy now, after spending years on the sidelines while HIIT and lifting-only routines ran the field. But what is zone 2 cardio, exactly? How can you make sure you're doing it right? And is it really so bad if your heart rate drifts into zone 3?\n\nZone 2 training is cardio done at a steady, low intensity. It has benefits for aerobic training (so you can run faster), anaerobic training (helping you to recover faster between reps and sets, or between intervals), and it's also an efficient, low-fatigue way to burn calories.\n\n“Zone 2” is a term drawn from the five-zone system of heart rate training, and the same concept is also known by other names and metrics. To runners, it is “easy pace” or “long slow distance pace.” To cyclists, it corresponds to zones 2 and 3 of a seven-zone system of mechanical power. In other sports, like swimming and rowing, it’s often just called “easy” or “low-intensity” exercise.\n\nAll that said, there is no official definition of zone 2, and different devices won't necessarily agree with each other. The same heart rate might be \"zone 2\" on one device and \"zone 3\" on another. So please take the following with a grain of salt.\n\nThe hallmark of zone 2 training is that it’s relatively slow and that it’s done at a steady pace. You'll be aiming for a heart rate of around 70%, but that doesn’t mean doing intervals at 90% and then resting at 50%. It means holding that 70% level the whole time you’re exercising. You can do zone 2 cardio with any steady, repetitive movement. Popular methods are running, cycling, swimming, rowing, brisk walking, fast hiking, or churning away on the elliptical. (Walking can count if you're new to exercise; as you get fitter, you'll probably need to choose a slightly harder form of exercise.)\n\nTo be clear, it’s still work—it’s not the same as sitting around resting—but it should feel like you could keep going forever if you wanted to. You don’t stop a zone 2 session when you get tired, you stop it because you set out for a 30- or 45- or 60-minute session, and your time is up.\n\nZone 2 work builds your aerobic base. When you do cardio at this kind of easy pace, your body adapts to get more efficient at it. These adaptations are great for your health as well as your cardio fitness. You grow more capillaries (tiny blood vessels) to get oxygen and nutrients to your muscles more efficiently. You get more mitochondria in each muscle cell (you have thousands of mitochondria powering each cell) and you produce more of the enzymes that turn fuel from food into usable energy. Your heart and your lungs get more efficient at taking in oxygen and moving blood to your muscles, and your muscles become able to store more carbohydrates (in a form called glycogen) so that more of the carbs you eat are at the ready when you start a run or ride.\n\nFor runners, your zone 2 work, often called \"easy pace,\" should make up most (some say 80%) of your weekly mileage. The fitness you build doing easy running is what allows you to benefit from, and recover from, harder efforts like interval training.\n\nFor people whose main sport is more strength oriented (meatheads like myself), zone 2 cardio strengthens the same body systems that help us recover between sets, and even between reps. It increases our work capacity, letting us get more work done in total. As long as you’re eating enough, adding cardio into your routine should make you able to do more work in the gym, not less. (And no, cardio does not kill your gains.)\n\nAnd for people who are just exercising for health, zone 2 cardio is the perfect “moderate” exercise we’re all supposed to get at least 150 minutes of per week. It’s heart-healthy, and even people with medical conditions that limit their ability to exercise can often do low intensity cardio safely. (Ask your doctor to be sure, of course.)\n\nImportantly, zone 2 training is very low fatigue. More time-efficient forms of cardio and conditioning like HIIT, hill sprints, or CrossFit WODs are great for your aerobic fitness, but those workouts have to be high intensity to work, and you’ll be pooped afterward. They’re great in small doses, but they kind of have to be in small doses.\n\nTechnically, zone 2 is defined in terms of heart rate, and the idea is that you glance at your watch and see whether you're in zone 2 or not. (There are five zones, with zone 5 being the hardest, so zone 2 is the second-easiest). But even though “zone 2” is defined in terms of heart rate, there are so many caveats to determining your max and deciding on the zone boundaries that I don’t recommend that beginners calculate it from heart rate percentages at first. Unless you’ve actually gotten your heart rate up to a maximum effort level, and know what that number is, you don’t really know your max heart rate.\n\nSo if you're a beginner, the best way to know if you’re in zone 2 is to ignore your watch and instead pay attention to your effort, and how it feels. On a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is nothing and 10 is all-out sprinting, low intensity cardio is about a 3 to 5. You’re working, but not very hard. If your breath starts to get ragged, or if you feel like you're getting pretty damn tired and you can't wait for this to end, you're probably somewhere 7+ and definitely going too hard for a zone 2 workout.\n\nA zone 2 pace is conversational, and it’s sometimes described with a “talk test.” If you could tell your friend about your day while you’re exercising, you’re probably around the right level. That doesn’t mean spitting out a few words here and there, but speaking in full sentences without feeling out of breath. If you find yourself stopping to catch your breath or if you feel like you need to take break, you’re going too hard. (That said, some of zone 3 is also within that conversational zone, but it's okay—zone 3 is still good for you.)\n\nThat said, it shouldn’t feel too easy—zone 2 is more like a brisk walk or easy jog than a leisurely stroll. If you stop, you should feel like you took a break from something. It should take a little work and focus to keep up the pace.\n\nBefore you start, there's a big caveat. Zone 2 is based on heart rate zones, and to set your zones correctly, you need an accurate max heart rate. Finding your max is a trickier task than you might expect, so you have my permission to skip this section completely, and scroll down to \"How do you know when you're in zone 2?\" which will teach you how to get into zone 2 by feel, no heart rate monitor needed.\n\nWith that out of the way, I'll explain how exactly to find your zone 2, if you want to do it by the book. There are two steps: finding your max heart rate, and then setting your zones based on that heart rate.\n\nYour maximum heart rate is defined as, literally, the fastest your heart can beat. (Sometimes people assume this is a guideline, that you should keep your heart rate under this number. Nope—if your heart rate is higher than the number you thought was your max, that just tells you that number was not your max.) Here are some different ways to find your max heart rate:\n\nA max heart rate field test (best for people with healthy hearts and some pain tolerance): There are a few ways of doing this, but basically you're going to try to push your heart rate to its absolute max, and see what that number is. The most common way is to find a long, steep hill, and run up it three times, really sprinting hard on the last one. The number you see at the end is a good estimate of your max. Obviously, don't do this if you've been told you shouldn't exercise at high intensity.\n\nYour personal history (best for athletes who have experience using a HR monitor): If you've done high intensity exercise in the past, especially killer efforts that left you collapsed on the floor, the highest number you've ever seen on your watch or heart rate monitor is probably your max, or close to it. A 5K race or an FTP test will often get you close, if you really pushed yourself the whole way.\n\nEstimating based on easy exercise (best for non-athletes who have experience using a HR monitor): If you have a sense of what heart rate you see when you're exercising at a steady, conversational pace, multiply the highest number you would consider conversational by 1.25 to find a number that you can use as your max. This is my own method, but it's based on studies that have found the top of conversational pace to be around 77-79% of max. This isn't as good as a field test, but for many people it will give a better result than the formula below.\n\nA formula. I don't recommend using a formula if you have the option of using either of the first two real-world options above. Using a formula to get your max heart rate is like asking ChatGPT for your shoe size. It will give a plausible guess, but it could easily be very, very wrong. Anyway, the easiest formula is to subtract your age from 220. (There are other formulas, but honestly they all have serious inaccuracies. I wouldn't worry about whether any one of them is \"better\" than the others. They all suck.)\n\nI have more here on why max heart rate formulas are pretty much all wrong, but that's beside the point for the moment. If you know your max heart rate, you can proceed to the next step.\n\nOnce you know your max heart rate (or have an estimate you're willing to work with), multiply to get the upper and lower boundaries of zone 2. Multiply by what? Well, there's more than one opinion out there about what zone 2 should be.\n\nIf you use a smartwatch or other device, go into the settings and set a custom heart rate (all the major brands can do this—check the instructions to find out where this setting lives.) The zones will usually populate automatically.\n\nAs I've written before, every device has a different idea of what should count as zone 2. If you'd like me to be the tiebreaker, I'd go with 60% to 75% of your max heart rate. So, multiply your estimated max heart rate by 0.6 to get the lower end of that zone, and 0.75 to get the higher end. For example, if your max heart rate is 200, your zone 2 is 120 to 150 beats per minute. If your max heart rate is 175, your zone 2 would be 105 to 132.\n\nI have good news for you: zone 3 has almost all the same benefits as zone 2. Don't view the top of zone 2 as a barrier thou shalt not cross; it's just a way of dividing easier exercise (zone 2) from medium intensity (zone 3). The more exercise you do, the more of it should stay in zone 2. Otherwise you could find yourself building up fatigue. After a zone 2 cardio session, you should feel good. You should feel like you totally could have done more, but you're saving some energy for tomorrow.\n\nSo if you have a hard time staying in zone 2, don't beat yourself up about it. Just try to keep your effort level low, on average, so you're still fresh for the next workout. As you get fitter, you'll find it easier to stay in zone 2.\n\nRunners often have trouble with this, because the dividing line between walking and running is sometimes too high to maintain an easy pace while you’re running, if you’re a beginner. The next best thing is to jog as slow as you can, and when you start to feel out of breath, switch to a brisk walk. For some people, a brisk walk for the whole session is a perfect zone 2 workout. As you get more fit, easy jogging will become possible.\n\nHere’s a real world example of how to keep a zone 2 pace: if I’m heading out for an easy run, I start at a nice chill jogging pace. But I live in a hilly neighborhood, so pretty soon I’ll be chugging up a hill and notice my breathing getting heavier. At this point, if my heart rate is getting higher than I'd like for this workout, I switch to a power walk. Jogging the flats and walking the uphills is a great way to keep your effort level steady, instead of accidentally turning your easy jog into a hill sprint workout.\n\nCyclists often measure their training in a seven-zone system that is based on how much power, in a physics sense, you are putting into the gears of your bike. These are called Coggan power zones, and bike training systems like Zwift and Peloton use the same basic idea. To calibrate these zones, you’ll take an FTP (functional threshold power) test—basically, a 20-minute race against yourself. From there, you (or your training app) calculates wattage numbers for your zones.\n\nZones 2 and 3 in this system usually correspond to our “zone 2” cardio. (Your heart rate at the end of an FTP test will be pretty close to your max heart rate, by the way, if you really went all-out.) If you train with both a heart rate monitor and a bike power meter, don’t worry if they don’t match exactly. A ride in power zones 2 and 3 will meet your low-intensity cardio needs, even if your heart rate starts in zone 1 and spikes into zone 3 by the end.\n\nFor other forms of cardio, go by feel, or by heart rate if you truly know your heart rate percentages. When you’re on the elliptical or the rower or the airbike, you should feel like you could carry on a conversation easily, and stop because time is up rather than because you’re running out of gas.",

Here's how threat actors are hijacking WhatsApp accounts—and how to defend yours.\n\nWhatsApp allows users to link their desktop or browser to their account without needing to enter login credentials in one of two ways: scanning a QR code and approving the session or confirming a numeric pairing code in the mobile app. While the GhostPairing scam could theoretically manipulate users in either approach, researchers found that the latter is much more common.\n\nThe fraud begins with a short message sent from a contact with a link that purportedly goes to a Facebook photo or some type of Facebook content. If you click through, you'll be directed to a spoofed Facebook login page to enter your phone number—a familiar confirmation flow for Meta platforms. The next screen will likely show a numeric code with instructions to enter said code into WhatsApp to confirm the login (again, this may feel like a familiar two-step verification). If you're not paying attention, you may not realize that this didn't do anything on your end but instead registered the attacker's browser as a linked device to your account.\n\nThe danger in this scam is that everything will seem normal on your device and in your account, as attackers haven't hijacked your credentials to lock you out. However, they can do anything and everything in WhatsApp that you can, such as reading chats, receiving messages, viewing and downloading media, collecting information from your contacts, and forwarding the same phishing link. As they learn more about you and the people you know, they can potentially use that for ongoing scams.\n\nAs always, be wary of links received via messaging platforms, even if they seem harmless or you think you know and can trust the sender. Threat actors frequently use social media and direct messaging to spread phishing lures. If you do click a link in WhatsApp (or any other communication), read all prompts carefully before providing or verifying any information to identify scams.\n\nTo protect your WhatsApp account specifically, you can set up two-step verification, which will also prevent attackers from adding or changing a connected email address. Go to Settings > Account > Two-step verification > Turn on or Set up PIN and add an email address when prompted. You can also check to see if there are any suspicious devices paired with your account under Settings > Linked devices and remove any you don't recognize or regularly use.\n\nFinally, if you have been targeted by this scam, let your WhatsApp contacts know, as threat actors may spread the malicious link by making it look like it came from you.",

They lost Kai Havertz from the opening day, while captain Martin Odegaard and Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Martinelli, Noni Madueke and Max Dowman have had spells on the sidelines.\n\nNow, after injuries mainly affecting attacking players, it is the Arsenal backline which is suffering.\n\nArteta was forced to play Declan Rice in an unfamiliar right-back position against Brighton on Saturday because Jurrien Timber was injured and Riccardo Calafiori picked up an issue in the warm-up.\n\nGabriel returned from injury in the 2-1 win, but the return dates of Cristhian Mosquera, Timber and Calafiori are not known.\n\n\"We're going to be really aware of the situation and the timescale of certain players,\" Arteta said.\n\n\"We have to be actively looking, and then can we do it or not?\n\n\"That's a different story, but our job is to be always very prepared because something can happen.\"",

Whichever way you look at it, it's a foul.\"\n\nThe VAR checked the goal but allowed Jones' on-field decision to stand. Defeat left Forest five points above the Premier League's relegation zone.\n\nThe PGMOL has previously played audio privately to clubs - including Forest - while PGMOL chief refereeing officer Howard Webb also discusses incidents on the Mic'd Up programme.",
