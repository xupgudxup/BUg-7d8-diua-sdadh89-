    "fullText": "The New York Jets will play their Week 18 finale versus the Buffalo Bills on Sunday.\n\nIt'll represent the last showing for a defense that must undergo a serious identity makeover in the offseason. Head coach Aaron Glenn will hire a new defensive coordinator. General manager Darren Mougey will also be tasked with acquiring more talented playmakers on defense. They are heavily outmatched heading into Sunday.\n\nUntil then, we've identified three potential X-factors for the Jets defense in Week 18.\n\nJermaine Johnson II hasn't recorded a sack in his latest six appearances. It's been tough sledding for the pass rusher who returned from a 2024 season-ending torn Achilles injury. Johnson continues playing with effort, so it would be nice to see him finish the season with a breakthrough.\n\nInterim defensive coordinator Chris Harris recently heaped praise on linebacker Jamien Sherwood. Sherwood leads the Jets in tackles by a longshot with 147 takedowns this season. Despite it being a lost season, he continues to compete to his full capabilities.\n\nVeteran defensive tackle Harrison Phillips has been a limited participant at practice this week. That indicates he's trending towards being available for Sunday's finale. The Jets need Phillips' run-stopping efforts against Josh Allen and James Cook.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jets Wire: New York Jets vs. Buffalo Bills: 3 X-factors on defense for Week 18",

    "fullText": "We’re heading into the final week of the 2025 NFL season, and the Rams won’t know where they stand for the postseason until we get to the other side of it.\n\nAs of right now, the Rams are slotted in at the No. 6 Wild Card spot, but things could shift depending on how Saturday’s late game between the Seahawks and 49ers shakes out. If the Seahawks win on Saturday, and the Rams beat the Cardinals on Sunday, then LA can wrap up the fifth seed. That would involve traveling to face the four-seed, which will be the NFC South winner. The Buccaneers are penciled into that spot right now after Saturday afternoon’s win over the Panthers, but they now need the Falcons to lose to the Saints on Sunday to cement their NFC South win.\n\nIf the Rams lose and the 49ers win, the Rams will stay in the sixth seed. In that case, they’ll play either the Eagles or the Bears to kick off the postseason, and I think it goes without saying that the 5-seed is the better option here.\n\nHere are the updated standings before Saturday’s games kick off in Week 18.\n\n1. Seattle Seahawks (13-3) – Clinched playoff spot\n2. Chicago Bears (11-5) – Clinched NFC North\n3. Philadelphia Eagles (11-5) – Clinched NFC East\n4. Carolina Panthers (8-8)\n5.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWe haven't seen San Francisco 49ers star linebacker Fred Warner on a football field in quite some time.\n\nThat's because Warner suffered a broken and dislocated ankle back in Week 6 that was supposed to completely end his season.\n\nHowever, there is renewed hope that Warner will make it back during the playoffs, although the Niners are going to have to win at least a game or two for that to be a possibility.\n\nYes, there is a chance Warner will play in the postseason.\n\nBut for that to even be a possibility, the Niners will have to make it to the NFC Championship Game or Super Bowl, as NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported.\n\nRapoport does add, however, that Warner would likely be limited if he does make it back during the playoffs, and he's more likely to be back by the Super Bowl rather than the NFC title game.\n\n\"Sources informed of Warner's situation say there is a chance that Warner's rehab could be going well enough for him to make a cameo in the NFC Championship Game if San Francisco is a participant or more likely Super Bowl LX, should it win the conference title,\" Rapoport and Garafolo wrote. \"And even then, it would likely be in spot duty. Any early return might put him at risk of further injury.\"\n\nEven if Warner is just limited upon his return, simply having him in uniform would provide a huge jolt to the 49ers at the most crucial moment of the season.\n\nMaxx Crosby trade rumor should have Eagles, Cowboys, Lions paying attention\n\nVikings' rumor J.J.

Another outstanding performance from Rashaun Agee helped send the Tigers back to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, with their first loss of conference play, as the graduate forward secured a double-double by leading the team with 15 points and 11 rebounds in the 75-72 win over LSU.

    "description": "Before moving ahead to Ole Miss, revisiting Miami’s emphatic punch that knocked out the defending national champions.",
    "fullText": "Tonight is the 23rd anniversary of the most controversial call in college football history, and three nights ago Miami finally got its revenge.\n\nNo. 10 Miami shocked No. 2 Ohio State 24-14 in the Cotton Bowl, ending the Buckeyes’ quest to become the first repeat national champion in the 12-team playoff era, and the first since Georgia in 2021-2022 and Alabama in 2011-2012. The 9.5-point upset wasn’t just one of the biggest in the CFP era, but it was poetic justice 23 years in the making. It also set the tone on a weekend where Ohio State, Georgia, and Alabama all lost, marking a changing of the guard in college football.\n\nRedemption for the Hurricanes 23 years later. pic.twitter.com/PyBsd1o84G\n\n— Mike Kennedy (@MikeKennedyNFL) January 1, 2026\n\nAnd before moving on to a challenging Ole Miss opponent, it’s important to cherish the juxtaposition from this year’s New Year’s Eve to that night 23 years ago. In 2003, Ohio State ended Miami’s 34-game winning streak and stopped the defending champions from repeating. On Tuesday night, Miami returned the favor, stopping Ohio State’s own repeat bid with the exact same formula the Buckeyes used against them two decades ago.\n\nFor a program haunted by Terry Porter’s controversial pass interference flag in overtime of the 2003 Fiesta Bowl – the call that gave Ohio State new life and eventually a 31-24 national championship victory- this wasn’t just a win. It was redemption. It was closure. It was sweet, intoxicating revenge.\n\n“I was full of emotions,” said cornerback Keionte Scott after his 72-yard pick-six gave Miami a 14-0 lead. “I think I took a little moment to peek at the [Ohio State] sideline and look at everybody and let them know what was going on.”\n\nThe Miami Hurricanes blow away the defending champs 🌪️😱\n\nMiami shocks the No. 2 Ohio State Buckeyes in the Cotton Bowl Classic 🙌 pic.twitter.com/favaquJZHO\n\n— FOX College Football (@CFBONFOX) January 1, 2026\n\nThat sideline included this year’s Heisman finalist, Julian Sayin, who looked petrified throughout the night. That sideline included Ryan Day, who had no answer for Mario Cristobal’s trenches. And that sideline included Caden Curry, who came up with a hypothetical that Ohio State would beat Miami 9 out of 10 times if they played. A pointless hypothetical that Miami fans have been hearing throughout this postseason and one that was not at all a reality on Wednesday night.\n\nThe Canes sideline, however, included Miami legends Jimmy Johnson, Michael Irvin, and Ray Lewis – witnesses to The U’s most satisfying victory in a generation.\n\nThe parallels between these two games are almost eerie, as if college football’s karma finally came full circle after 22 years. StateOfTheU’s own, Rob Weaver, discussed them in his feature leading up to the Cotton Bowl.\n\nIn 2003, Ohio State rode an elite defense featuring future NFL stars like Mike Doss, Will Smith, AJ Hawk, and Cie Grant. That defense held Miami’s star-studded offense – Willis McGahee, Clinton Portis, Andre Johnson, Kellen Winslow Jr., and Ken Dorsey – to just 24 points in regulation, controlled the clock, and physically dominated the defending champions.\n\nIn 2025, Miami used a similar blueprint. The Hurricanes’ defense, led by a diesel front of Akheem Mesidor and All-American Rueben Bain, Jr., held Ohio State to nine yards in the first quarter and sacked freshman quarterback Julian Sayin five times. They forced turnovers, including the epic Keionte Scott pick six. They punched the Buckeyes in the mouth – time and time again – until Ohio State had nothing left, including Jakobe Thomas who made future first rounder Carnell Tate cower under the bright lights, recording just three receptions for 37 yards. Sure, Miami native Jeremiah Smith was electric but he chose to chase waterfalls while Miami continues to build something special (the grass isn’t always greener Jeremiah, and you still have eligibility to right that wrong – but that’s for another day). The haymakers Miami threw continuously throughout the night were 23 years in the making.\n\nWatch this Ohio State staffer trying to get Jeremiah Smith away from all the Miami love pic.twitter.com/ppa7SB0HNP\n\n— CaneSport Miami Hurricanes (@CaneSport) January 1, 2026\n\nThe 2002 Buckeyes had Craig Krenzel, a game manager who let the defense dominate. Miami had Carson Beck, who completed 19 of 26 passes with zero turnovers and managed the game to perfection. Clean and efficient from start to finish. Neither quarterback was spectacular but each made the plays when needed. Krenzel made a key 17-yard pass on fourth-and-14 in overtime while Beck had an enormous run on third-and-long in the fourth. Both were exactly what their teams needed.\n\nOhio State in 2003 controlled the clock and won with methodical, grinding football, outrushing the Canes 145 yards to 65 yards. Miami in 2025 rushed for 131 yards on 40 carries, with Mark Fletcher Jr. earning offensive MVP honors. When Ohio State closed to 17-14 in the fourth quarter, Miami responded with a 10-play, 70-yard drive that consumed over five minutes and ended with CharMar Brown‘s game-sealing touchdown. Flipping the script from 2003, the 2025 Miami gathered 153 rush yards to the Buckeyes’ 45.\n\nKeionte Scott is such a complete player. Over 13 TFLs this year, and this time, the elite play recognition shows up on the pick-six.\n\nMaking game-changing plays with his processing-fueled aggression.\n\n pic.twitter.com/MskHkfF3Ao\n\n— Ian Cummings (@IC_Draft) January 1, 2026\n\nIt was championship football – physical, relentless, suffocating. The kind of football Ohio State used to break Miami’s hearts in 2003. The kind of football Miami used to break Ohio State’s dynasty dreams in 2025.\n\nThe Hurricanes didn’t just beat Ohio State. They beat them the way Ohio State beat Miami in 2003, by punching them in the mouth until the defending champions crumbled.\n\nUnderstanding what makes this victory so sweet requires understanding what was stolen from Miami on that January night in 2003.\n\nThe 2001 Miami team has a legitimate argument as the greatest college football team ever assembled. The 2002 squad was almost as talented, riding a 34-game winning streak into the Fiesta Bowl as 11.5-point favorites – the near 10-point spreads in each game being another parallel. The Buckeyes were defending their championship against a program that hadn’t won a title in 32 years.\n\nIf Miami had won that game – if Terry Porter’s flag had never been thrown – the trajectory of college football might have been completely different. This is a little less of a hypothetical than the malarkey that Caden Curry and Notre Dame fans (regarding their playoff omission) have been spewing. Back-to-back titles could have cemented Miami as the dynasty of the 2000s. Recruits would have kept flowing to Coral Gables. The U would have maintained its throne.\n\nInstead, the dynasty died that night. The 2003 Fiesta Bowl shaped the trajectories of both programs. Ohio State went 103-24 following that victory with multiple Big Ten titles, while Miami went 77-48 in the years after.\n\nThe Miami Hurricanes are heading to the CFP Semifinals after a huge upset win over the Ohio State Buckeyes.\n\nWHAT. A. WIN. 🏆 🙌🏻\n\n(📸 @LuFromdade) pic.twitter.com/OV1oPTXTBO\n\n— The Kevin Harlan Effect (@KevHarlanEffect) January 1, 2026\n\nUSC rose to prominence the very next season. Ohio State built their modern powerhouse on the foundation of that championship, playing in five national title games since 2003 and winning two more. Miami fell from grace almost immediately, never winning an ACC championship after joining in 2004, spending two decades trying to recapture lost glory.\n\nThe 2003 Fiesta Bowl didn’t just end Miami’s winning streak. It ended their dynasty. Ohio State built theirs on the ruins.\n\nFor 22 years, Miami fans have carried that pain. They’ve watched Willis McGahee’s knee get destroyed. They’ve replayed Ken Dorsey’s final incomplete pass. They’ve raged about Terry Porter’s delayed flag. They’ve watched Ohio State thrive while The U struggled to be relevant.\n\nTuesday night, Miami finally got to return the favor – and it felt glorious.\n\nPerhaps the most poetic detail of Miami’s revenge? The Hurricanes will face No. 6 Ole Miss in the Fiesta Bowl semifinals on January 8.\n\nThe Fiesta Bowl. Yup, Miami’s first appearance in that stadium (kinda) since the night Terry Porter’s flag changed everything. Their first time playing in Glendale, Arizona since January 3, 2003 – when they left as heartbroken runners-up, their dynasty in ruins.\n\nOne of the best reps of his career pic.twitter.com/GaRQvmmUlw\n\n— art (@canefilms) January 1, 2026\n\nNow they return as giant slayers, having just ended Ohio State’s repeat bid the same way the Buckeyes ended theirs. They return with an elite defense punching opponents in the mouth and the capability to beat anyone in the nation if they repeat what they did Wednesday. They return with legends like Jimmy Johnson, Michael Irvin, and Ray Lewis believing again. Not only those legends, but the many Hurricanes who believed in Miami during the last two decades.\n\nThey return one win away from a national championship game at Hard Rock Stadium – their home field – where they could complete the most improbable redemption story in college football history.\n\nBack in March, Michael Irvin posted about “stumping on the grave of that PASS Interference ghost.” That ghost has been exorcised. The pain has been washed away. The score has been settled. Irvin not only stomped on em, but he put that belt to ass.\n\nThis is me ⁦@OhioStateFB⁩ stumping on the grave of that PASS Interference ghost (RIP-my ass) that cheated us out of our 🙌🏾 fam (⁦@CanesFootball⁩ ) CHAMPIONSHIP !!!!THATS TWO RINGS I LOST ON BAD P.I. CALLS!!!! pic.twitter.com/L80WBjIrKs\n\n— Michael Irvin (@michaelirvin88) March 31, 2025\n\nThe symmetry is almost too perfect: Ohio State ruined Miami’s title repeat in the 2003 Fiesta Bowl. Miami ruined Ohio State’s title repeat and now returns to the Fiesta Bowl to continue their championship run. The hunter became the hunted. The wounded became the avenger. The dynasty that was stolen might just be reborn.\n\nFor Miami fans who have carried 22 years of anger, who have argued and who have wondered “what if” a thousand times – this victory means everything.\n\nIt means The U is back – not just competitive, but dangerous. Not just relevant, but feared. Not just hoping to recapture the past, but building something new while honoring what was lost. Mario Cristobal’s greatest strength – recruiting – has only been enhanced even more by proving his ability to secure quality wins and increase player development (this latter part has been on display not only with Francis Mauigoa and Bain, but also OJ Frederique, Malachi Toney, and Bryce Fitzgerald, among many other contributing underclassmen).\n\nMiami Hurricanes: Cotton Bowl Champions pic.twitter.com/H5uytB5Fh0\n\n— CFB Kings (@CFBKings) January 1, 2026\n\nOhio State came in as 9.5-point favorites, the defending national champions with dynasty aspirations. Miami punched them in the mouth for 60 minutes – the same way Ohio State punched Miami 22 years ago – and sent them home with their repeat dreams shattered.\n\nThe 2025 Hurricanes used 2003 Ohio State’s own formula against them: elite defense, game management, physical football, and relentless pressure. They beat the defending champions at their own game, in the biggest upset in CFP history, and earned a return trip to the stadium where their dynasty died.\n\nNow Miami heads back to the Fiesta Bowl – not as 11.5-point favorites defending a championship, but as 3.5-point favorites trying to complete one of the greatest revenge stories college football has ever seen, especially after stubbing their toe against the likes of Louisville and SMU during this season and nearly squandering their playoff chances. One more win in Glendale, and they’ll play for a national championship at home in Miami Gardens.\n\n“Go pick all yall homeboys up off the field” 😂😂 pic.twitter.com/skHMrpGXJF\n\n— Top Tier Miami (@TopTierCanes) January 2, 2026\n\nThe dynasty that was stolen in the 2003 Fiesta Bowl might just be resurrected in the 2025 Fiesta Bowl. The punch Ohio State threw 23 years ago finally got answered. The Canes continue their return to the promised land with their second big boy bowl in two weeks, countering the lone New Year’s Six they’ve played in the last two decades (an uninspiring 34-24 Orange Bowl loss to Wisconsin in 2017).\n\nThe pain is over. The revenge is complete. And somehow, impossibly, Miami gets to return to the scene of their greatest heartbreak to continue their championship run. The job is not finished.\n\nRegardless, as it relates to Ohio State, after 23 years of waiting it feels like justice to return to Arizona.\n\nThe Hurricanes are back. And this time, they’re the ones doing the punching. We’re onto Ole Miss.",

The game ended on a desperate series of laterals that resulted in a fumble.\n\nMayfield connected with Otton on an 18-yard TD pass for a 7-0 lead as the Bucs scored a touchdown on their opening drive for the third straight game. It was Otton’s first TD of the season.\n\nDown 10-0, the Panthers turned Christian Rozeboom’s interception into a quick score. Rozeboom returned the pick 20 yards to Tampa Bay’s 19. Young then connected with Tommy Tremble on an 8-yard TD pass to cut it to 10-7.\n\nJacob Parrish picked off Young late in the second half and the Buccaneers got a 36-yard field goal from McLaughlin to take a 13-7 halftime lead.\n\nMcLaughlin kicked a 48-yard field goal early in the fourth to extend Tampa Bay’s lead.\n\nCarolina’s Ryan Fitzgerald missed a 54-yarder short on the opening drive of the third quarter.\n\nMayfield completed his first six passes before misfiring on a cross-field, 13-yard toss to Payne Durham, who was wide open in the end zone. The Bucs settled for McLaughlin’s 29-yard field goal and a 10-0 lead.\n\nGene Deckerhoff, the voice of the Buccaneers for 37 years on radio, is retiring after the season. Six-time Pro Bowl wide receiver Mike Evans and veteran linebacker Lavonte David could have played their last game with the Buccaneers and possibly in the NFL if they choose to retire.\n\nDavid was a second-round pick in 2012, made one Pro Bowl, was a first-team All-Pro once and second team All-Pro twice.\n\nEvans, the No. 7 overall pick in 2014, had a 1,000-yard season every year of his career until this one, when he broke his clavicle in October and missed several games.\n\nPanthers: DT Bobby Brown III (head) left the game to be evaluated for a concussion.\n\nBuccaneers: LB Anthony Walker (ankle) was injured on the opening kickoff. ... CB Jamel Dean (shoulder) and OLB Anthony Nelson (knee) didn’t play. ...

    "fullText": "After a scare earlier this week, the Seahawks aren’t down to their undrafted rookie third-string left tackle, after all.\n\nJosh Jones was the starter in place of injured Charles Cross for the third consecutive week Saturday, in pregame drills about a half hour before Seattle kicked off at the San Francisco 49ers for the NFC West title.\n\nJones had been questionable to play. He missed practices Tuesday and Wednesday with ankle and knee issues. Coach Mike Macdonald said the veteran swing tackle had gotten “banged up a little” last weekend in the Seahawks’ win at Carolina.\n\nJones began trending toward playing when he practiced on a limited basis Thursday.\n\nThe team signed rookie free agent Amari Kight from the practice squad to the active roster earlier this week, as insurance. He was backing up Jones in pregame drills Saturday.\n\nMacdonald said Friday the Seahawks believe Cross will be able to play in their first playoff game. He’s been out since he injured his hamstring on Jason Myers’ game-winning field goal on the final play Dec. 14 against Indianapolis.\n\nThere were no surprises in Seattle’s inactive players for the game Saturday.\n\nThey were quarterback Jalen Milroe, injured starting safety Coby Bryant, linebacker Jared Ivey, Cross, rookie offensive linemen Bryce Cabledue and Mason Richman and rookie tight end Nick Kallerup.\n\nTy Okada was poised to start again for Bryant, who has a knee injury. It was to be Oakada’s 11th start the season. The first nine was when safety Julian Love was out injured.",

    "description": "The Cougars scored a 83-73 win over Kansas State in Saturday’s Big 12 opener.",
    "fullText": "Prior to Saturday, Kansas State had only lost four times at home against ranked opponents in the Jerome Tang era.\n\nBut after BYU’s visit to Manhattan, Tang now has five such losses with the Wildcats.\n\nThe No. 10-ranked Cougars scored a 83-73 win over Kansas State in Saturday’s Big 12 opener, marking BYU’s first 10-game win streak since the days of Jimmer Fredette more than a decade ago.\n\n“Obviously, BYU is a terrific team, and Kevin (Young) does a great job and was very proud of our guys’ effort,” Tang told reporters postgame.\n\n“We have to continue to get better. To win or lose this game, we have to get better. We have some glaring things that are standing out, but they’re correctable. I know our guys’ heart, so I know that we will improve in the areas that we need to.”\n\nThe Wildcats were top 10 nationally in 3-point shooting team prior to Saturday, but against the Cougars they made just 3 of 21 attempts from behind the arc.\n\n“Well, they didn’t go in, you know, the ones that we took, they weren’t bad shots,” Tang said. “I thought we turned down like four or five that we should have been ready to shoot, that we weren’t ready to shoot. Some of that’s a credit to (BYU’s) length, right, those closeouts, but some of it, you know, I don’t know why we didn’t take certain shots that we’d have normally taken.\n\n“I said at one point, ‘Man, we can’t make 3s if we don’t shoot them,’ you know. That’s one of the strengths of our team, and so, you know, a lot of credit goes to BYU, because of the percentage of 3s that we took, as opposed to 2s, it’s too great. We got to look at the film and figure that out.”\n\nKansas State did force 19 total BYU turnovers, but such defensive success wasn’t enough to upset the Cougars.\n\n“We wanted to be the more aggressive team. It was great, but when you force 19 turnovers, you can’t have 17 points off (them). You need to have 27 points off of it, because there are a lot of them were live ball turnovers, and so we’ve got to capitalize,” Tang said.\n\n“I don’t think that we capitalized on that, and I thought that they controlled the pace of the game in the second half. We didn’t play fast enough. We didn’t.”\n\nBYU superstar AJ Dybantsa, once a Kansas State recruiting target, dazzled once again in his first taste of Big 12 action, scoring 24 points with eight rebounds, three assists and three steals.\n\nWith his 24 points, Dybantsa is now the country’s leading scorer at 23.1 points per game.\n\nAJ DYBANTSA vs K State \n\n24 PTS \n7 REB \n3 AST \n3 STL pic.twitter.com/ZTqK6Z20ZY\n\n— BYU Men's Basketball (@BYUMBB) January 3, 2026\n\n“You know, I’ve been watching AJ since he was in the seventh grade, and love him and his family. You know, I had a great time recruiting him,” Tang said.\n\n“I’ve watched his games this season, and he’s been one of the most efficient players, and today, he was very efficient again, you know, scoring 24 points on 15 shots.”\n\nKansas State now falls to 9-5 on the season and 0-1 in Big 12 play, with a tough road trip to No. 1 Arizona and Arizona State coming up next.\n\n“I’m hoping (our players) walk away with confidence that if that’s a top 10 team (in) the country and the team people say can win a national championship, and we didn’t play close to what we’re capable of playing, then, I mean, the ceiling is high, and so we should be really confident, excited about getting back into practice and improving them,” Tang said.",

    "fullText": "The San Francisco 49ers will wear their all-black rival jerseys tonight against the Seattle Seahawks. Brock Purdy and the offense won’t have their most dangerous wide receiver or all-everything left tackle.\n\nThe Seahawks are already stingy enough, but being short-handed at two of the most critical positions will make Kyle Shanahan, Brock Purdy, and everybody else’s job on offense much more challenging.\n\nIf there’s anybody who can devise a game plan without Trent Williams and Ricky Pearsall, it’s Shanahan. George Kittle and Christian McCaffrey will earn their paychecks tonight. McCaffrey might catch 15 passes if that’s what it takes for the offense to move the ball.\n\nHow can Robert Saleh and the 49ers defense rise to the occasion? Bryce Huff will face a backup left tackle. It would be a great time for rookies Alfred Collins and CJ West to generate pressure. That’s the best way to spook Sam Darnold, who is prone to batted passes and throwing off his backfoot when pressured up the middle.\n\nDarnold threw the ball to the Panthers on the first play of the game. They dropped it. That’s been an issue for the 49ers’ defensive backs this season. If there were ever a time to redeem themselves, it’s Week 18 with the No. 1 seed on the line.\n\nBased on warm-ups, Eric Kendricks will see some action at SAM linebacker. That makes the 49ers more athletic at the second level without sacrificing size against the run. Offensively, it looks like Demarcus Robinson will get the start in place of Pearsall.",

    "fullText": "Stanford men's basketball had its first game of the new calendar year and opened it with a shocking 80-76 win against No. 13 Louisville on Jan. 2 at Maples Pavilion in Stanford, California.\n\nIt was the biggest victory for Stanford head coach Kyle Smith, who earned his first ranked win at Stanford. It was also the first time in program history that Stanford beat Louisville.\n\nFreshman guard Ebuka Okorie led Stanford with 28 points, finishing 9-for-18 from the field and made 8-of-10 free throw attempts. Senior forward Chisom Okpara scored 17 points and notched a season-high eight rebounds, two assists, two blocks and two steals.\n\nRedshirt junior Ryan Agarwal scored 12 points, making all four of his 3-point attempts.\n\n\"Great win for the program,\" Smith said told reporters after the game. \"We needed it. Some guys made some big efforts. Obviously, Ebuka was tremendous. But you know, Ryan going 4-for-4 from 3 was very helpful.\"\n\nSmith said after watching film, with some guys getting called out for their efforts and performance, the team responded.\n\n\"They really bought in to what we're trying to do,\" Smith said. \"From the getgo I thought we were pretty competitive in trying to take away 3s from those guys. They're a really explosive offense and a good defensive team.\"\n\nOkorie has scored at least 20 points in eight games for Stanford. He is ranked No. 10 in Division I basketball in points per game, averaging 21.5.\n\nThe 6-foot-2 guard is third out of all freshmen in scoring behind Duke forward Cameron Boozer and BYU forward AJ Dybantsa.\n\n\"After watching film, I noticed I needed to be more aggressive. Whether it's getting downhill, getting my teammates involved (or) creating for myself,\" Okorie told reporters after the game. \"I feel like that's what I did today and it helped us get the win.\"\n\nStanford improves to 12-3 this season and 1-1 in the ACC. Its next game is on the road at Virginia Tech on Wednesday, Jan. 7. The game will be televised on ACC Network.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Stanford basketball vs Louisville score, highlights",

    "fullText": "Baker Mayfield and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers held off Carolina 16-14 on Saturday to keep their playoff hopes alive to the bitter end of the NFL season.\n\nThe victory prevented the Panthers from locking up the NFC's last post-season berth and leaves both teams anxiously watching Sunday's results to learn which one progresses.\n\nTampa Bay edged an error-strewn, rain-soaked clash, taking an early lead and relying on cautious tactics and multiple field goals to cling on.\n\n\"We just found a way to win right there -- tough divisional opponent, and we did everything we could today,\" said Bucs' quarterback Mayfield.\n\n\"Sit back and see what happens tomorrow,\" said Mayfield, who threw for a touchdown, completing 16-of-22 attempted passes for 203 yards.\n\nDespite both teams ending the regular season with an 8-9 losing record, one of them is still guaranteed to win the historically weak NFC South division and reach the playoffs.\n\nWhether the Bucs or the Panthers advance now depends on the outcome of a clash between two teams with no hope of reaching the playoffs -- the Atlanta Falcons and the New Orleans Saints.\n\nTampa Bay, who have won the NFC South for the past four years and started this season well before imploding, will be rooting for the bottom-placed but in-form Saints.\n\nMeanwhile, Carolina must rely on inconsistent Atlanta. If the Falcons win, a three-way tie atop the NFC South at 8-9 would see the Panthers edge through on head-to-head results.\n\nTampa Bay scored on the game's opening drive, as tight end Cade Otton belatedly caught his first touchdown of the season, and the Bucs soon added a field goal.\n\nBut following an intercepted Baker Mayfield pass, a wide-open Tommy Tremble grabbed a Panthers touchdown with a clever, mazy run.\n\nWith torrential downpours hampering both sides, another interception -- this time off Carolina's Bryce Young -- set up another Bucs field goal for a 13-7 half-time lead.\n\nRain eased in the second half, but not before kicker Ryan Fitzgerald slipped to miss a 54-yard Panthers field goal attempt.\n\nNerves grew among the home crowd as Tampa Bay adopted ultra-cautious tactics to protect a slender lead.\n\nBut favorable decisions by officials -- a missed penalty, plus two pass interference calls -- helped Tampa Bay reach a 16-7 lead in the fourth quarter.\n\nAfter yet another rain-soaked Panthers fumble, and a blocked Tampa Bay field goal attempt, Jalen Coker caught an eight-yard touchdown with just over two minutes remaining to bring Carolina hope.\n\nBut the Buccaneers held on. A grinning Mayfield said he will now learn if his season will continue into the playoffs \"from my own couch.\"",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nNo matter what happens on Sunday, when the Carolina Panthers need the Atlanta Falcons to beat the New Orleans Saints in order to win the division and make the playoffs, it has been a successful rookie season for wide receiver Tetairoa McMillan.\n\nWith the Week 18 game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the books following a 16-14 loss for the Panthers, McMillan has finished his first season in the NFL with 1,000 receiving yards.\n\nMcMillan tallied a team-high 84 yards on Saturday, which leaves him with exactly 1,013 for the season.\n\nAnd, with his crossing the 1,000-yard mark, he becomes the first rookie wideout to accomplish that feat this season — and he might be the only one to do it.\n\nThe next closest rookie receiver to 1,000 yards going into Week 18 was Buccaneers wideout Emeka Egbuka, who entered Saturday's game with 930, but he only posted eight yards in the win over Carolina, so he has officially fallen short.\n\nNo other rookie wide receiver is even close to McMillan and Egbuka.\n\nDrafted with the No. 8 pick in last year's draft, McMillan has been everything the Panthers could've hoped for and looks the part of the No. 1 wideout the Panthers thought they were getting when they drafted him.\n\nAs long as he continues to move in the right direction, the future is very bright for the Arizona product.\n\nMaxx Crosby trade rumor should have Eagles, Cowboys, Lions paying attention\n\nVikings' rumor J.J. McCarthy plan puts these 5 QBs in play for MIN\n\nGiants, Titans should be intrigued by Browns head coach rumor\n\nPatriots will tie NFL record with Week 18 win over Dolphins\n\nNew Dolphins QB poached from Raiders had Tom Brady endorsement",

One name to keep an eye on is edge rusher Jordan Norman, who is slated to visit Lexington at some point, according to 247 Sports’ Chris Hummer. Colorado is also set to get a visit.\n\nA redshirt junior with two years of eligibility remaining, Norman started his career at South Alabama, committing to the program as a 3-star prospect in the 2023 recruiting class. After two seasons, appearing in all 13 games as a sophomore, he transferred to play for Jon Sumrall and Tulane this past season, where he was a difference maker.\n\nThis past season with the Green Wave, Norman recorded 28 tackles, eight tackles for loss, and six sacks. Looking at the analytics, Norman ranked third in the AAC in pressure rate (11.7%) and was a top-10 graded defensive lineman (78.5).\n\nAnnouncing his decision to enter on Friday, the opening day of the portal, there was some belief that Norman would follow Sumrall to Florida.\n\nThus far, he is only scheduling visits to Kentucky and Colorado.",

    "fullText": "Clemson defensive back Ricardo Jones plans to enter the NCAA transfer portal, according to On3’s Hayes Fawcett. Jones only spent two seasons with the Tigers after being a nice recruiting win. But Dabo Swinney will now have to replace him in the safety room, seeing some roster turnover after the season.\n\nJones wasted no time becoming an impact player for Clemson once getting to campus. He played in 12 games as a true freshman before appearing in all 13 games during the 2025 season. Twelve of those were starts.\n\nA total of 59 tackles pop up on the stat sheet over two years. Not much when it came to getting into the backfield, only having two tackles for a loss and one sack. Natural with his position, Jones was better when dropping back in coverage. Three pass breakups and nine defended passes are nice but Clemson really enjoyed the six interceptions from Jones. One of them went the other way for a touchdown in the rivalry game against South Carolina.\n\n“He is an instinctive player,” Swinney said after the rivalry win. “He loves to practice, he loves to play, he loves his teammates, he is tough as they come and he knows his limitations. He is a very smart and instinctive player… That was an incredible interception. His hands were under the ball, it was incredible. So, I am just really happy for him.”\n\nJones played high school football at Warner Robins (GA) Northside, where he was a four-star prospect. He was the No. 142 overall recruit in the 2024 cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies.",

    "description": "The Utah Mammoth show flashes of greatness, but they need to find ways to string wins together.",
    "fullText": "After a 7-2 win on Long Island on New Year’s Day, Utah Mammoth fans felt like their team could go the entirety of 2026 without losing.\n\nIt was a short-lived pipe dream.\n\nThe Mammoth lost 4-1 to the New Jersey Devils on Saturday. They’re now 0-4-0 against the Devils all-time.\n\n“Clearly not good enough,” said Mammoth defenseman Sean Durzi after the game. “... We shouldn’t be happy about that.”\n\nThe Devils are the fifth-lowest-scoring team in the NHL, and their offense is very much a group effort.\n\nGoing into the game, there was a three-way tie for their goal-scoring lead. Nobody had scored more than 11 goals all season. For context, that’s tied with the St. Louis Blues for fewest goals scored by the team’s leading scorer.\n\nThe group at the top moved up together on Saturday. Timo Meier and Nico Hischier, who were tied for the team lead, both scored, as well as Jesper Bratt and Dougie Hamilton, who aren’t far behind.\n\nThey all scored consecutively, putting Utah down 4-0 before the end of the second period.\n\nMichael Carcone spoiled Jacob Markström’s shutout with a goal just after a Mammoth power play expired, but it wasn’t nearly enough to steal a comeback win for Utah.\n\n“Puck management early in the game cost us a lot, I think,” said Mammoth head coach André Tourigny after the game. “It’s a team with a tight gap, and we tried to play in front of them and we paid for it.\n\n“And then, when we were trailing, they played good defense. We had good opportunities, but we could not bury it.”\n\nThe only consistent thing about the Mammoth this season is how consistently the word “consistency” has come up.\n\nOK, maybe that’s a bit of an exaggeration — but ever since their seven-game win streak ended in late October, they haven’t been able to win more than two games in a row.\n\nAgain, their 7-2 win against the New York Islanders on Thursday was good for morale, but it doesn’t mean much when you lose by three the next game.\n\nDurzi voiced the team’s concurrence in his postgame interview.\n\n“We’ve got to try to get on a run here,” he said. “We can’t have one good game and then one bad game. ... We’ve got to string together a lot of good ones.\n\n“Not that we haven’t been doing good things, but it’s just getting points and getting wins.”\n\nDurzi, like many of his teammates after previous losses, defended the team’s decision-makers, who have been subjects of much criticism by the fan base this season.\n\n“There’s a lot of heart in our room. There’s a lot of character. We’re wanting it. There’s no separation within the group. There’s no pointing fingers, this, that,” he said.\n\n“We’re owning it, and we know we’ve got to be better. We have the right leadership, we just have to do it — and that’s what it comes down to.\"\n\nPOSTGAME\n\n\"We're owning it. We know we got to be better. We have the right leadership. We just have to do it, and that's what it comes down to.\"@utahmammoth Sean Durzi following the Devils game pic.twitter.com/Y6LnPhmgmc\n\n— Utah Mammoth PR (@UtahMammoth_PR) January 3, 2026\n\nI was six years old when the Vancouver Canucks, my childhood team, traded Todd Bertuzzi to the Florida Panthers. I was too young to really appreciate him at the time, but I do know how much that market has yearned for a player like him ever since.\n\nBertuzzi stood at 6-foot-3 with 230 pounds of pure muscle. Most guys of that profile were pure enforcers — and he did have that side to his game — but he was also at 46-goal, 97-point player at his peak.\n\nHe bullied his way to the front of the net. Trying to stop him was like jumping in front of a train, thinking you’d knock it off-course. And if you even thought of endangering one of his teammates, well, you were lucky if you still had all your teeth when he was done with you.\n\nThe Canucks have been searching for “the next Todd Bertuzzi” ever since they let him go. It was Zack Kassian, then Jake Virtanen, then Micheal Ferland, Antoine Roussel, Vasily Podkolzin — the list goes on. They all had their moments, but none of them could quite leverage their assets to become the dominant power forward that Bertuzzi was.\n\nTruthfully, the Todd Bertuzzi archetype is an endangered species. Aside from Buffalo Sabres forward Tage Thompson, there’s no one in the league quite like him (even his nephew, Chicago Blackhawks forward Tyler Bertuzzi).\n\nBut the Mammoth have a sapling with the potential to grow into that role. His name is Daniil But.\n\nBut put his rhino-like characteristics on display against the Devils, as he has a number of times this season in both the NHL and the AHL.\n\nIn this particular instance, two minutes into the game, he intercepted the puck in the neutral zone, chipped it past the defender, took a few hard strides and powered his way to the front of the net.\n\nAside from Carcone’s goal, it was Utah’s best scoring chance of the game — and it came from nothing but hard work.\n\nBut has that Bertuzzi potential: the size, the scoring ability. His offensive numbers haven’t been there yet, but he gets as many scoring chances as anyone. The goals will come once he fully adjusts to the NHL level.\n\nThe only thing he needs to add now is the meanness. He’s a really nice person, so maybe it’s a lot to ask — but even if he can throw the occasional big hit and maybe even drop the gloves here and there, his ceiling will be much higher than 6-foot-6.\n\nUtah’s second power play unit has been great for the last few weeks. Carcone’s goal happened just after the Mammoth’s power play had expired, so it won’t count as a tally on their record, but for all intents and purposes, that’s exactly what it was.\n\nMichael Carcone nets one! pic.twitter.com/AMyyptRPg0\n\n— Utah Mammoth (@utahmammoth) January 3, 2026",

    "description": "Tampa Bay's 16-14 defeat of the Carolina Panthers means the NFC South title will be decided on the NFL regular season's final day.",
    "fullText": "The NFL runs a risk every May when its schedule comes out – hoping those “TBD” slots it reserves for the Saturday of Week 18 ultimately get filled by games worthy of the standalone broadcast windows.\n\nJan. 3 provided further proof that the league knows what it’s doing – serving up a pair of matchups with massive postseason stakes. And even then, the schedule makers got another win – the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ 16-14 defeat of the Carolina Panthers actually failing to decide the NFC South title (more on that later).\n\nThat won’t be the case Saturday night, when the San Francisco 49ers and Seattle Seahawks will definitively decide who wins the NFC West and the conference’s No. 1 overall playoff seed.\n\nBut, for now, here are the winners, losers – and otherwise – from Saturday’s games:\n\nThe Bucs and Panthers now knotted with 8-9 records, the winner of the division is still unknown. In a vacuum, Tampa Bay owns the common-games tiebreaker that puts the team in its near-perennial spot atop the division. But if the Falcons create a three-way tie by winning Sunday, Carolina would get the tiebreaker by virtue of a 3-1 mark against the Falcons and Bucs, eclipsing the other two teams.\n\nStill undefeated. The footing at Tampa's Raymond James Stadium was bad, and it was evident as players slipped, kicks were affected, and the general quality of play was impacted in such a critical game.\n\nThe home of “Monday Night Football” continues to enjoy an expanded presence late in the season, broadcasting both of Saturday’s consequential duels with another to come during the wild-card round of the playoffs. A year from now, ESPN will have the Super Bowl for the first time – though it will be simulcast on ABC. And Disney’s NFL footprint is only likely to continue growing ahead of its pending deal to acquire NFL Network, RedZone Channel and other media assets owned and controlled by the NFL, the crossover between the entities already readily apparent.\n\nHey, a team eliminated from postseason contention weeks ago now has something tangible to play for Sunday in its finale against the New Orleans Saints. Not only might a season-ending four-game winning streak save this coaching staff but knocking off the Bucs in the process would be especially sweet.\n\nThe Carolina running back, who ran for nearly 1,100 yards in 2024 for the Dallas Cowboys but was grossly undervalued by them and the free agent market has essentially matched that figure this season and earned a $1 million bonus Saturday by reaching 1,350 yards from scrimmage. Dowdle, who signed a $2.75 million contract with the Panthers before the season – and prior to hitting his incentive Saturday and others previously – should see a lot more green on the market a few months from now.\n\nIn what might have been the 14-year veteran's final game – or at least the linebacker's last one with the Bucs, his contract set to expire after the season – he recorded six stops Saturday to tie Hall of Famer Derrick Brooks as the most prolific tackler in franchise history.\n\nWith Carolina set up in the Bucs’ red zone early in the fourth quarter and trailing by nine, Dowdle slipped while tossing the ball back to QB Bryce Young on an apparent flea flicker. Fumble … and pretty much game, set and match. Tampa Bay didn't actually convert the turnover into points but did burn nearly six precious minutes off the clock before getting a field-goal try blocked. (Regardless, Dowdle still gets to keep his milli.)\n\nFUMBLE! The @Buccaneers jump on the loose ball 😤\n\nCARvsTB on ESPN/ABC\nStream on @NFLPlus and ESPN App pic.twitter.com/T7Pln5ymPn\n\nWhether it was the lateral that was prematurely blown dead − though the officials still moved the Panthers back 7 yards − or the dubious offensive pass interference against Tetairoa McMillan, which wiped out his 32-yard reception, the zebras were especially unkind to Carolina as it tried to whittle down a 13-6 halftime deficit.\n\nKicking off Saturday without injured starters – especially studs like all-universe LT Trent Williams and WR1 Ricky Pearsall – was hardly an ideal way to take on the mighty Seahawks defense with so much hanging in the balance.\n\nAll NFL news on and off the field. \n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: NFC South playoff spot up for grabs after Bucs top Panthers",

They also have wins over Memphis (by nine), Rutgers (by 16), Minnesota (by 28), and Marquette (by 20).\n\nPurdue has a well-rounded offense, averaging 86 points per game, with Trey Kaufmann-Renn and Fletcher Loyer leading the team with 14 points per game apiece. Braden Smith is averaging 12.5 points a game himself, while leading the country with 9.5 assists per game.\n\nThe Boilermakers shoot the ball efficiently (51.4 percent from the field, 39.9 percent from three), defend at a high level (66 points allowed per game, 15th in KenPom defensive efficiency), and have the resume of a top-five team.\n\nSo, it’s going to be a tough challenge for Wisconsin, which has been inconsistent, on Saturday.

    "fullText": "It’s been something you could set your watch to for the better part of five years – conversations starting about whether or not the Pittsburgh Steelers will move on from Mike Tomlin right around this time of the year. However, those conversations have largely just been speculation more than anything, with the Steelers themselves never showing any real interest in moving on from the longest-tenured head coach in major American sports.\n\nThe Steelers have been connected to multiple head coaching candidates over the last week. Albert Breer of Sports Illustrated noted that Los Angeles Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula is a name to watch for Pittsburgh.\n\n“The Steelers, Ravens and Bills have generated conversation in recent weeks,” Breer writes. “Is there any reality to it? I don’t think these would be firings. But there is some thought that Mike Tomlin could look at a reset, with the Pittsburgh roster potentially going through one soon too, and take a year or two in TV before returning to the sideline. And interestingly enough, Shula’s name has been connected to the Steelers, in case there is an opening.”\n\nAdditionally, Dianna Russini of The Athletic reports that the Steelers had internal conversations about potentially hiring Notre Dame head coach Marcus Freeman before he committed to returning to the university.\n\n“Though Freeman ultimately announced he’s staying at Notre Dame, there’s a strong belief around the league that this won’t be the last time his name is connected to NFL opportunities,” Russini writes. “The Giants, Titans and Browns all had internal discussions about Freeman, as did the Pittsburgh Steelers (in the event longtime coach Mike Tomlin decided to step away).”\n\nThis is the first time I can recall insiders going on record with names they believe could replace Tomlin – that’s not a coincidence. It’s not to say that Tomlin will 100 percent be gone in 2026, but it’s very clear that the Steelers are preparing for his departure. Things like this don’t get out by accident, and it’s certainly something to monitor in the coming weeks.\n\nBe sure to bookmark Behind the Steel Curtain for all the latest news, breakdowns, and more!\n\nRams defensive coordinator labeled Steelers potential next head coach\n\nNFL insider: Mike Tomlin is safe with Steelers regardless of result vs. Ravens\n\nSteelers top front office member potentially leaving for GM job\n\nSteelers place Darnell Washington on season-ending IR\n\nSteelers should lean more on Pat Freiermuth, Kenneth Gainwell against Ravens",

    "fullText": "The Panthers blew their chance to win the NFC South on Saturday night, which forces them to become Falcons fans for a day. If Atlanta beats New Orleans on Sunday, the Panthers will become division champs via the round-robin tiebreaker among three 8-9 teams — Carolina, Tampa Bay, and Atlanta.\n\nMany will say Carolina's opportunity was impaired by multiple officiating errors. After the 16-14 loss, coach Dave Canales steered clear of criticizing the folks in black and white.\n\n\"I don't really want to get into that because we just didn't play well enough, offensively speaking,\" Canales told reporters. \"We didn't get our run game going. A bad day on third down, which doesn't give us an opportunity to extend the drives and really have a balanced offense the way that we can play. Some missed opportunities out there. So it really just has to be on us and about the execution and all of us making sure we're, you know, in the right plays at the right time.\"\n\nThe weather impacted both teams, too, but it definitely seems as though the officiating created more issues for the road team. In the end, it won't matter if the Falcons, favored by three, can beat the Saints.\n\nThe problem for the Falcons (and for the Panthers) is that Atlanta has a 4-1 record at night, and a 3-8 record in afternoon games. On multiple occasions, they've followed a prime-time win with a clunker.\n\nThe Panthers will be praying that the Falcons get the engine running smoothly against the Saints. Carolina also will be hoping that the outcome won't be affected by the officials.\n\nUnless, of course, officiating affects the game in a way that helps the Falcons.",

    "title": "Aristotle's Rhetoric, Strunkified",
    "description": "Aristotle's Rhetoric, condensed and stylized in the spirit of Strunk & White.",
    "fullText": "Presented without commentary, save the following Editor's Note:\n\nI constructed this (with LLM assistance) because I tried to read the original text (which may be found here) and struggled over many inverted turns of phrase. This version tries to make accessible the core ideas, while preserving the exact paragraph structure of the original. I hope you find it of use.\n\nRhetoric corresponds to Dialectic. Both concern matters common to all men, not specific sciences. Thus, everyone uses both; everyone attempts to discuss, maintain, defend, and attack statements. Ordinary people do this randomly or through practice. Since both ways work, we can handle the subject systematically. We can inquire why some succeed through practice and others spontaneously. Everyone agrees that such inquiry belongs to an art.\n\nCurrent treatises on rhetoric cover only a small part of the art. Persuasion is the art's only true constituent; the rest is accessory. These writers ignore enthymemes, the substance of persuasion, and focus on non-essentials. Arousing prejudice, pity, and anger appeals to the judge, not the facts. If all trials followed the strict rules of well-governed states, these writers would be silenced. Ideally, laws should define rules, leaving little to the judge's discretion. This prevents perverting the judge with emotion—like warping a carpenter's rule. A litigant should only prove the facts: what happened or did not happen. The judge must decide on justice and importance, not take instructions from the litigants.\n\nWell-drawn laws should define nearly every point, leaving little to the judges. First, finding a few sensible legislators is easier than finding many just judges. Second, laws result from long consideration, whereas court decisions are hasty. Third, the lawgiver judges prospectively and generally; the jury decides definite, present cases. Often, friendship, hatred, or self-interest obscures the jury’s vision. Therefore, the judge should decide as little as possible. He must decide only whether something happened, since the lawgiver cannot foresee the future. Consequently, writers who theorize about the 'introduction' or 'narration' ignore the art's essentials. They only teach how to manipulate the judge's mind, not how to use enthymemes.\n\nAlthough political and forensic oratory share the same principles, and political oratory is nobler, authors focus solely on pleading in court. In political oratory, non-essentials matter less. It is less unscrupulous because it treats wider issues. The judge in a political debate decides his own interests. The speaker need only prove the facts. In forensic oratory, however, one must conciliate the listener. The judges, intent on their own satisfaction, often surrender to the disputants rather than judge them. Thus, many courts forbid irrelevant speaking; in public assemblies, the judges protect themselves.\n\nRhetoric, strictly speaking, concerns modes of persuasion. Persuasion is a form of demonstration; we are most persuaded when we consider a thing demonstrated. The rhetorical demonstration is an enthymeme, the most effective mode of persuasion. The enthymeme is a syllogism. Dialectic studies syllogisms. Therefore, he who understands the syllogism best will best understand the enthymeme, provided he knows its subject matter. The faculty that recognizes truth also recognizes probability. A man who guesses well at truth will guess well at probabilities.\n\nWe have shown that ordinary writers on rhetoric treat non-essentials and favor forensic oratory.\n\nRhetoric is useful for four reasons. First, truth and justice naturally prevail. If judgments fail, the speakers are to blame. Second, exact knowledge does not always convince an audience; we must use notions possessed by everybody. Third, we must be able to argue on opposite sides—not to deceive, but to understand the facts and confute unfair arguments. Only dialectic and rhetoric draw opposite conclusions impartially, though truth is easier to prove. Fourth, it is absurd to be ashamed of physical weakness but not of mental weakness. Rational speech is more distinctive of man than physical strength. If one argues that an unjust orator harms others, this applies to all good things except virtue—strength, health, wealth, and generalship can all be misused.\n\nRhetoric is not bound to a single subject; it is as universal as dialectic and clearly useful. Its function is not simply to persuade, but to discover the available means of persuasion in each case. In this, it resembles other arts. Medicine does not always heal, but it treats the patient as well as possible. Rhetoric discerns both the real and the apparent means of persuasion, just as dialectic discerns the real and the apparent syllogism. A 'sophist' is defined by his moral purpose, not his faculty. In rhetoric, however, 'rhetorician' may describe either the speaker's skill or his purpose. In dialectic, a 'sophist' has a specific purpose; a 'dialectician' has a specific faculty.\n\nLet us now account for the systematic principles of Rhetoric. We must define rhetoric anew.\n\nRhetoric is the faculty of observing, in any given case, the available means of persuasion. No other art shares this function. Medicine instructs on health, geometry on magnitudes, arithmetic on numbers. Rhetoric, however, observes the means of persuasion on almost any subject. Therefore, it is not concerned with any special class of subjects.\n\nSome modes of persuasion belong to the art of rhetoric; others do not. The latter—witnesses, evidence under torture, written contracts—exist beforehand. The former we construct ourselves. The one kind we use; the other we invent.\n\nSpoken persuasion has three kinds: personal character, audience emotion, and proof. Character persuades when the speech makes the speaker seem credible. We believe good men more readily, especially where certainty is impossible. This persuasion should result from the speech, not from the speaker's prior reputation. Contrary to some writers, the speaker's character is his most effective means of persuasion. Secondly, persuasion comes through the hearers when the speech stirs their emotions. Our judgments vary with our feelings—pleasure or pain, friendliness or hostility. Present-day writers focus almost exclusively on this. We will discuss this later. Thirdly, persuasion comes through the speech itself when we prove a truth or an apparent truth.\n\nTo command these three means, a man must reason logically, understand human character and goodness, and understand the emotions—their nature, causes, and excitation. Thus, rhetoric is an offshoot of dialectic and ethical (or political) studies. Rhetoric often masquerades as political science, and its professors as experts, sometimes through ignorance, sometimes through ostentation. As stated, rhetoric is a branch of dialectic. Neither is a scientific study of a separate subject; both are faculties for providing arguments.\n\nRegarding proof: as dialectic has induction and syllogism, so does rhetoric. The example is a rhetorical induction; the enthymeme is a rhetorical syllogism. Everyone uses either enthymemes or examples to prove a point. Since all proof rests on syllogism or induction (as shown in the Analytics), enthymemes must be syllogisms and examples inductions. The Topics explains the difference. Proving a proposition by similar cases is induction (dialectic) or example (rhetoric). Proving that a distinct proposition follows from certain truths is syllogism (dialectic) or enthymeme (rhetoric). Each type has advantages. Some styles rely on examples, others on enthymemes. Speeches with examples are persuasive, but those with enthymemes excite more applause. We will discuss their sources and uses later. Now let us define the processes.\n\nA statement is persuasive because it is self-evident or appears proved by other statements. In either case, it persuades someone. No art theorizes about individual cases. Medicine treats classes of patients, not just Socrates. Similarly, rhetoric deals with what seems probable to men of a given type, not just to an individual. Dialectic constructs syllogisms from materials calling for discussion; rhetoric draws from regular subjects of debate. Rhetoric deals with matters we deliberate on without systems, addressing listeners who cannot follow long chains of reasoning. We deliberate only on alternative possibilities. Nobody deliberates on the unchangeable.\n\nWe can form syllogisms from previous conclusions or from unproved but doubtful premises. The former are too long for untrained thinkers; the latter fail because their premises are not accepted.\n\nEnthymemes and examples deal mainly with the contingent. The enthymeme consists of few propositions, fewer than a normal syllogism. If a proposition is familiar, omit it; the hearer supplies it. To show Dorieus won a contest with a crown as prize, simply say, \"He won the Olympic games.\" Everyone knows the Olympic prize is a crown.\n\nFew rhetorical syllogisms rely on necessary facts. We deliberate on our actions, which are contingent, not necessary. Conclusions about the usual or possible must come from similar premises. Thus, most enthymeme propositions are usually, not necessarily, true. Enthymemes use Probabilities and Signs. A Probability is a thing that usually happens—a contingent universal. Signs relate to the statement as particular to universal or universal to particular. The infallible sign is a \"complete proof\" (tekmerion); the fallible sign has no specific name. Infallible signs form syllogisms. If a sign is irrefutable, it is a complete proof. For instance, \"He has a fever\" is an infallible sign that he is ill. A fallible sign, like \"He breathes fast\" as a sign of fever, is refutable, for one may breathe fast without fever.\n\nWe have defined Probability, Sign, and complete proof. The Analytics explains why some form syllogisms and others do not.\n\nThe 'example' is a kind of induction. It relates part to part, or like to like. When a familiar statement supports a similar one, it is an example. For instance, to show Dionysius seeks a bodyguard to become a despot, we cite Peisistratus and Theagenes, who did the same. These instances support the general principle: a man asking for a bodyguard schemes to become a despot.\n\nOne distinction in enthymemes (and dialectical syllogisms) is often overlooked. Some belong to rhetoric or dialectic; others belong to specific arts. Missing this, people fail to see that handling a subject correctly leads them away from pure rhetoric. Dialectical and rhetorical syllogisms use universal Lines of Argument (topoi) applicable to many subjects (e.g., \"the more or less\"). Special Lines of Argument apply only to specific classes (e.g., ethics or physics). General Lines of Argument increase understanding of no particular class. Special Lines of Argument, however, approach a distinct science. Most enthymemes use special Lines of Argument. We must distinguish the special from the general. Special Lines of Argument are propositions peculiar to a class; general are common to all. We begin with the special. First, let us classify rhetoric.\n\nRhetoric has three divisions, determined by the three classes of listeners. The listener determines the speech's object. He is either a judge of things past or future, or an observer. A member of the assembly decides future events; a juryman, past events; an observer decides on the orator's skill. Thus, there are three divisions of oratory: political, forensic, and ceremonial.\n\nPolitical speaking urges action or inaction. Private counsellors and public speakers always take one of these courses. Forensic speaking attacks or defends; litigants always do one or the other. Ceremonial oratory praises or censures. These three kinds refer to three different times. The political orator concerns himself with the future: he advises for or against things to be done. The litigant concerns himself with the past: he accuses or defends regarding things done. The ceremonial orator concerns himself properly with the present: he praises or blames existing conditions, though he may recall the past or guess at the future.\n\nEach kind of rhetoric has a distinct end. The political orator aims at expediency or harmfulness; he urges acceptance because it does good, or rejection because it does harm. All other points—justice, honor—are subsidiary. Litigants aim at justice or injustice; they treat other points as subsidiary. Those who praise or attack aim at honor or disgrace, treating other considerations as subsidiary.\n\nSpeakers prove these are the ends by sometimes ignoring everything else. A litigant may admit the fact or the harm, but never the injustice; otherwise, there would be no trial. Political orators often concede anything except that their course is inexpedient. They may not care if enslaving innocent neighbors is unjust. Similarly, those who praise often make a man's neglect of his own interest a ground for praise. They praise Achilles for championing Patroclus at the cost of his life; to die was noble, though to live was expedient.\n\nEvidently, the orator must command propositions on these three subjects. The propositions of Rhetoric are Complete Proofs, Probabilities, and Signs. Every syllogism is composed of propositions; the enthymeme is a syllogism composed of these specific propositions.\n\nOnly possible actions can occur in the past or present. Things that have not occurred or will not occur cannot be done. Therefore, all speakers must have propositions about the possible and the impossible, and about whether a thing has happened or will happen. Further, all men attempt to prove that good or harm, honor or disgrace, justice or injustice, is great or small. Thus, we must command propositions about greatness and smallness, both universal and particular. We must be able to say which is the greater good or the greater injustice.\n\nThese are the subjects for which we must master relevant propositions. We must now discuss each class in turn: political, ceremonial, and legal oratory.\n\nWe must first ascertain what subjects the political orator counsels on. He deals only with things that may or may not take place. No counsel is given on inevitable or impossible things. Nor do we deliberate on all possible things, such as natural or accidental events. We deliberate only on matters within our power—matters we can set going.\n\nWe will not attempt to classify these subjects accurately here. That belongs to political science, not rhetoric. Rhetoric combines logic and ethics; it resembles dialectic and sophistry. Treating rhetoric or dialectic as sciences of definite subjects destroys their nature. They are practical faculties. However, we will mention points of practical importance.\n\nPolitical speakers deliberate primarily on five matters: ways and means, war and peace, national defence, imports and exports, and legislation.\n\nRegarding Ways and Means, the speaker must know the country's revenue sources to add overlooked ones or increase defective ones. He must know all expenditures to abolish the superfluous and reduce the excessive. Men become richer by reducing expenditure as well as by increasing wealth. Experience in home affairs is insufficient; one must study the methods of other lands.\n\nRegarding Peace and War, he must know his country's actual and potential military strength, and its history of wars. He must know the same about neighboring and likely hostile countries. This allows him to maintain peace with the stronger and make war on the weaker. He must compare military powers. He should study the wars of other countries, for similar causes produce similar results.\n\nRegarding National Defence, he must know the defensive forces and the positions of forts. He must know the lie of the country. This allows him to increase or reduce garrisons and guard strategic points.\n\nRegarding Food Supply, he must know the country's needs and its home production. He must know what to export and import to negotiate treaties. He must ensure his country offends neither stronger states nor useful trading partners.\n\nAbove all, he must understand legislation, for a country's welfare depends on its laws. He must know the different constitutions, their conditions for prosperity, and their causes of destruction. Constitutions are destroyed by being pushed too far or not far enough. Democracy turns into oligarchy if pushed to excess, just as an aquiline nose becomes deformed if too aquiline. The speaker should study his country's history and the constitutions of other nations. Books of travel help with laws and customs; historical researches help with politics. These, however, belong to political science.\n\nThese are the most important kinds of information for the political speaker. We will now state the premises for arguing for or against measures regarding these matters.\n\nEvery man aims at a certain end: happiness and its constituents. This aim determines his choices. Advice concerns happiness—what creates it or destroys it. We ought to do what creates happiness and avoid what destroys it.\n\nWe may define happiness as prosperity combined with virtue, as independence, as the secure enjoyment of pleasure, or as a good condition of property and body with the power to guard and use them. Nearly everyone agrees happiness is one or more of these.\n\nThe parts of happiness are good birth, many and good friends, wealth, many and good children, a happy old age, and bodily excellences like health, beauty, strength, stature, and athletic skill. Also fame, honor, good luck, and virtue. A man with these internal (soul/body) and external (birth, friends, money, honor) goods is completely independent. He also needs resources and luck for security. Let us define these parts.\n\nGood birth in a state means indigenous or ancient members, distinguished early leaders, and many admirable descendants.\n\nGood birth in an individual means free citizenship on both sides, notable ancestors (for virtue or wealth), and many distinguished relatives.\n\n\"Many and good children\" means, for a community, numerous young men of good body (stature, beauty, strength) and soul (temperance, courage). For an individual, it means numerous children with these qualities. This includes both male and female children. Women should have bodily beauty and stature, and soul-self-command and industry. Communities, like Sparta, where women are in a bad state, spoil half of human life.\n\nWealth consists of plenty of money, land, estates, implements, livestock, and slaves. These must be secure, gentlemanly, and useful. Productive property is useful; enjoyable property is gentlemanly. Security means the power to use it; ownership means the power to dispose of it (give or sell). Wealth lies in use, not ownership.\n\nFame is respect from everybody, or from the good or wise.\n\nHonour is the token of a reputation for doing good. It is paid chiefly to benefactors, past or future. Doing good means preserving life, wealth, or other goods. Honour includes sacrifices, eulogies, privileges, land grants, front seats, state burial, statues, and public maintenance. Presents are also honours; they satisfy both the money-lover (as property) and the honour-lover (as a token).\n\nHealth is a condition allowing the use of the body while keeping free from disease. A \"healthy\" man like Herodicus, who abstains from everything to stay alive, is not truly healthy. Beauty varies with age. A young man's beauty is fitness for running and strength contests—pleasant to look at. An all-round athlete is most beautiful. A man in his prime is fit for war—pleasant yet formidable. An old man is strong enough for necessary exertion and free from deformity. Strength is the power to move others at will—by pulling, pushing, lifting, pinning, or gripping. Excellence in size means surpassing the average without losing speed. Athletic excellence combines size, strength, and swiftness. A runner moves legs fast and far; a wrestler grips; a boxer strikes. A pancratiast does both; an all-round athlete does all.\n\nA happy old age comes slowly and painlessly. It requires bodily excellence and good luck. Even a strong man suffers if diseased or unlucky. Long life is independent of health or strength, but we will not discuss that here.\n\nA friend tries to do what is good for you for your sake. He who has many such friends has \"many friends\"; if they are worthy, he has \"good friends\".\n\nGood luck is the acquisition of good things due to luck. Some are artificial, some natural (like beauty and stature). Things that excite envy usually come from luck. Luck also causes unexpected good results: you are handsome when your brothers are ugly, or you find a treasure others missed, or a missile misses you.\n\nWe will define virtue when we discuss Eulogy.\n\nWe now understand our aims in urging or deprecating proposals. The political orator aims at utility—what is useful to do. Utility is a good thing. Therefore, we must understand Goodness and Utility.\n\nA good thing is chosen for its own sake, or for the sake of something else. It is sought by all rational beings, or prescribed by reason. It brings satisfaction and self-sufficiency. It produces or maintains these states, or prevents their opposites. One thing entails another simultaneously (as health entails life) or subsequently (as learning entails knowledge). Production occurs in three ways: as being healthy produces health, as food produces it, or as exercise usually does. Both acquiring good and removing bad are good. Acquiring a greater good for a lesser, or a lesser evil for a greater, is good. Virtues are good because they put us in good condition and produce good actions. Pleasure is good because all animals aim at it. Consequently, pleasant and beautiful things are good.\n\nHere is a detailed list of good things. Happiness: desirable in itself and sufficient. Justice, courage, temperance, magnanimity, magnificence: excellences of the soul. Health, beauty, and the like: bodily excellences productive of pleasure and life. Wealth: the excellence of possession. Friends and friendship: desirable and productive. Honour and reputation: pleasant and productive. The faculty of speech and action. Good parts, strong memory, quick intuition. All sciences and arts. Life itself. Justice, as the cause of good to the community.\n\nThese are admittedly good. For disputed goods, argue thus: That is good of which the contrary is bad. That is good of which the contrary helps our enemies; if cowardice helps them, courage helps us. Generally, the contrary of what our enemies desire is valuable. (\"Surely would Priam exult.\") However, sometimes our interest coincides with our enemies', as when a common evil unites us.\n\nFurther, moderation is good; excess is bad. That on which much labor or money is spent is good; it is an end reached through means. (\"And for Priam... should they leave behind them a boast.\") Also, the proverb about breaking the pitcher at the door applies.\n\nWhat most people seek is good. \"Most people\" implies \"everybody.\" What is praised is good. Even what enemies praise is good; if they admit it, it must be evident. (Corinthians felt insulted by Simonides: \"Against the Corinthians hath Ilium no complaint.\")\n\nWhat discerning people favor is good—as Athena favored Odysseus. Generally, what men deliberately choose is good. This includes things bad for enemies or good for friends, provided they are practicable. \"Practicable\" means possible and easy. \"Easy\" means done quickly or without pain. Also good are things men wish for: either no evil or a balance of good. Things possessed exclusively, or appropriate to birth and capacity, are good. Things easily effected are good because they are practicable. Things that gratify friends or annoy enemies are good. Things chosen by those we admire, or for which we are fitted, are good. Things no worthless man can achieve bring greater praise. Finally, what we desire we consider pleasant and better. A man pursues what corresponds to his disposition: the victory-lover seeks victory; the money-lover, money. These are the sources of persuasion about Good and Utility.\n\nSince people often agree two things are useful but disagree on which is more so, we must discuss relative goodness and utility.\n\nA thing that surpasses another contains it plus something more. \"Greater\" implies comparison with \"less\"; \"great\" and \"small\" imply comparison with the normal. The great surpasses the normal; the small is surpassed by it.\n\nWe define \"good\" as desirable for its own sake, sought by all, or chosen by the wise. It produces or preserves goods. The end is the good for the sake of which else is done. Therefore, a greater number of goods is better than a smaller number, if the smaller is included. The larger contains the smaller.\n\nIf the largest member of one class surpasses the largest of another, the first class surpasses the second. If the tallest man is taller than the tallest woman, men are generally taller than women. Superiority of classes corresponds to the superiority of their largest members.\n\nIf one good always accompanies another, but not vice versa, the former is greater; it implies the use of the latter. Accompaniment is simultaneous (life with health), subsequent (knowledge with learning), or potential (cheating with sacrilege).\n\nIf two things surpass a third, the one surpassing it more is greater. What produces a greater good is itself greater. What is produced by a greater good is also greater. Health is better than pleasure because it is more wholesome.\n\nWhat is desirable in itself (like bodily strength) is better than what is merely wholesome, which is not pursued for its own sake. An end is better than a means. What needs less is more self-sufficing and therefore better. What cannot exist without a second, while the second can exist without it, is inferior to the second.\n\nA beginning or cause is a greater good than what is not. Without a cause, nothing exists. Where two causes produce consequences, the cause with more important consequences is more important. Conversely, the cause of more important consequences is itself more important. Thus, one can argue a thing is important because it is a beginning, or because it is an end. Leodamas accused Callistratus of being more guilty for prompting the deed, but Chabrias for doing it.\n\nWhat is rare is better than what is plentiful. Gold is better than iron, though less useful, because it is harder to get. Conversely, the plentiful is better because we can use it more often. \"The best of things is water.\" Generally, the hard is better than the easy because it is rarer; yet the easy is better because it is as we wish.\n\nThat is the greater good whose contrary is the greater evil, or whose loss affects us more. Positive goodness is better than the mere absence of badness. Good things have noble functions; bad things have base ones. Superiority in desirable qualities is better: keen sight is better than keen smell. Unusually great love of friends is nobler than unusually great love of money.\n\nIf it is nobler to desire a thing, that thing is nobler. The importance of the object corresponds to the importance of the instinct. If a science is valuable, so is its object.\n\nWhat the wise or the majority judge good must be so. Good is what understanding chooses; therefore, what understanding declares better is better. What better men choose is better. Courage is better than strength. Suffering wrong is better than doing wrong, for the just man chooses it.\n\nThe pleasanter thing is better, for all pursue pleasure. A pleasure unmixed with pain, or more lasting, is greater. The nobler thing is better. What we desire earnestly for ourselves or friends is a greater good; what we least desire is a greater evil. Lasting and secure things are better.\n\nCo-ordinate terms follow the same rule. If \"brave\" is better than \"temperate,\" then \"bravery\" is better than \"temperance.\" What all choose is better than what some choose. What competitors or enemies consider better is better; their judgment is impartial.\n\nSometimes we argue that what all share is better (it is a dishonour not to share); other times, what few share is better (it is rare). Praiseworthy things are better. Things with heavy penalties for absence are better.\n\nDividing things into parts makes them seem better; they seem to surpass more things. Homer lists the horrors of a captured city to rouse Meleager. Piling up facts produces a similar effect.\n\nSince hard or rare things are better, superiority due to season, age, or place is valuable. Accomplishing something beyond one's natural power or years is noble. What is natural is better than what is acquired.\n\nThe best part of a good thing is particularly good. Pericles called the loss of young men \"the spring taken out of the year.\" Things useful in pressing need (old age, sickness) are better. What leads directly to the end is better. What is possible is better than what is impossible. What is at the end of life is better.\n\nReality is better than appearance. We define appearance as what a man would not choose if it remained unknown. Thus, receiving benefits is better than conferring them, for one would choose to receive even secretly. Being is better than seeming. Men say justice is of small value because it is better to seem just than to be just; not so with health.\n\nWhat serves many purposes (life, pleasure, noble conduct) is better. Hence wealth and health are highly valued. What brings pleasure with less pain is better. What makes a better whole when added to a third thing is better. Visible possessions are better because they seem real. What is dearly prized is better; blinding a one-eyed man is worse than half-blinding a two-eyed man.\n\nWe have now set forth the grounds for arguing for or against a proposal.\n\nTo persuade audiences on public affairs, one must understand the forms of government—their customs, institutions, and interests. Men are persuaded by their interests, which lie in maintaining the established order. The supreme authority gives decisions; this authority varies with the government. There are four forms: democracy, oligarchy, aristocracy, monarchy. The supreme right to judge rests with the governing power of each.\n\nIn a democracy, citizens distribute offices by lot. In an oligarchy, they require a property qualification. In an aristocracy, they require education—specifically, education laid down by law. Those loyal to national institutions hold office; they are considered \"the best men,\" hence the name \"aristocracy.\" Monarchy is rule by one man. Kingship is limited by conditions; tyranny is unlimited.\n\nWe must notice the ends of each government, for people choose actions that lead to their ends. The end of democracy is freedom; of oligarchy, wealth; of aristocracy, the maintenance of education and institutions; of tyranny, the protection of the tyrant. We must distinguish the customs and interests that realize these ideals. Rhetorical persuasion relies on ethical as well as demonstrative argument; a speaker convinces us if we believe he possesses goodness or goodwill. Similarly, we must know the moral qualities characteristic of each government, for the character of the government provides our most effective means of persuasion. We learn these qualities from their deliberate acts of choice, which are determined by their ends.\n\nWe have considered the objects of political persuasion and the grounds for arguing utility. We have also briefly considered how to learn the moral qualities and institutions of the various governments. The Politics gives a detailed account.\n\nWe must now consider Virtue and Vice, the Noble and the Base, the objects of praise and blame. This will also help us make our own characters appear credible—our second method of persuasion. We make others trust our goodness in the same way we make them trust others'. Praise may be serious or frivolous, addressing humans, gods, inanimate things, or animals.\n\nThe Noble is both desirable for its own sake and praiseworthy, or both good and pleasant because good. If this is true, virtue is noble, being good and praiseworthy. Virtue is a faculty of providing and preserving good, or of conferring great benefits on all occasions. Its forms are justice, courage, temperance, magnificence, magnanimity, liberality, gentleness, prudence, and wisdom. The highest virtues are those most useful to others, like justice and courage. Liberality is useful because liberal men spend rather than fight for money. Justice lets men enjoy their own property legally; injustice does the opposite. Courage disposes men to noble deeds in danger; cowardice does the opposite. Temperance disposes men to obey the law regarding physical pleasures; incontinence does the opposite. Liberality spends for others; illiberality does not. Magnanimity does good on a large scale; [its opposite is meanness]. Magnificence produces greatness in spending; its opposites are smallness of spirit and meanness. Prudence is the understanding that decides wisely about happiness and goods.\n\nThis suffices for virtue and vice. Things productive of virtue are noble, as are the effects and signs of virtue. Deeds of courage are noble, as are just actions (though receiving justice is not always noble; being punished justly is shameful). Actions rewarded by honor, or done for others, or done for one's country, are noble. Actions good in themselves, not just for the individual, are noble. Noble actions include those enjoyed after death, those done for others, benefits to others, services to benefactors, and good deeds generally.\n\nThe opposites of shameful things are noble. Men are ashamed of saying or doing shameful things. As Sappho told Alcaeus: \"If your wish were noble, shame would not weigh on your eyelids.\"\n\nThings men strive for without fear are noble; they lead to fame. Qualities of naturally finer beings are noble (a man's vs. a woman's). Qualities giving pleasure to others are noble (justice). Avenging oneself is noble, for requital is just. Not surrendering is noble (courage). Victory and honor are noble, proving superiority. Memorable things are noble, especially if they last after death, are always honored, or are exceptional. Possessions bringing no profit are noble, fitting a gentleman. Distinctive customs, like long hair in Sparta, are noble. Not practicing a sordid craft is noble for a free man.\n\nTo praise or blame, identify a man's actual qualities with closely allied virtues or vices. Call the cautious man cold-blooded, the stupid man honest. Idealize the passionate man as \"outspoken,\" the arrogant as \"impressive.\" Call rashness courage, and extravagance generosity. This appeals to the audience and allows misleading inferences from motive: if a man risks danger needlessly, he will surely do so in a noble cause.\n\nConsider the audience. As Socrates said, praising Athenians to Athenians is easy. If the audience esteems a quality, attribute it to your hero. Represent everything esteemed as noble.\n\nAppropriate actions are noble—those worthy of ancestors or past career. Adding to existing honor is noble. Even inappropriate actions are noble if they surpass expectation—if an average man becomes a hero in adversity, or a successful man becomes easier to get on with. Compare Iphicrates: \"Think what I was and what I am.\"\n\nSince we praise intentional actions, prove the hero's deeds were intentional. Assert that coincidences were intended. Show a pattern of good actions to prove intent and character.\n\nPraise expresses the eminence of good qualities. Encomium refers to actual deeds. Accessories like birth and education help credibility. We bestow encomiums for deeds. Yet deeds evidence character; we praise a man if we believe he would do the deed. Calling a man blest or happy includes praise and encomium, as goodness is part of happiness.\n\nPraise is akin to urging action. Suggestions for action become encomiums when rephrased. \"A man should be proud of what he owes to himself\" becomes \"He is proud of what he owes to himself.\" To praise, think what you would urge; to urge, think what you would praise.\n\nTo heighten praise, point out uniqueness, primacy, or superiority. Mention the season and occasion. If he achieved success often, emphasize it to credit him, not luck. Mention if he inspired new observances (like Hippolochus or Harmodius). Censure bad men for the opposite.\n\nIf you lack material, compare him with others, especially famous men. Surpassing the great is noble. If not famous men, compare him with ordinary people; superiority reveals excellence. Heightening effect suits declamations (epideictic); examples suit deliberative; enthymemes suit forensic speeches.\n\nThese are the lines for speeches of praise or blame. We know the materials for encomiums and censures. Censure simply reverses the grounds of praise.\n\nWe must now discuss Accusation and Defence, and the ingredients of their syllogisms. We must ascertain three things: the incentives to wrongdoing, the state of mind of wrongdoers, and the kind of persons wronged. We will deal with these in order, after defining 'wrongdoing'.\n\n'Wrongdoing' is injury voluntarily inflicted contrary to law. Law is either special (written law of a community) or general (universal unwritten principles). Voluntary acts are done consciously and without constraint. All deliberate acts are conscious. The causes of deliberate, illegal harm are vice and lack of self-control. A man's wrongs correspond to his bad qualities. The mean man wrongs others for money; the profligate, for pleasure; the effeminate, for comfort; the coward, from terror. The ambitious man seeks honor; the quick-tempered, anger; the victory-lover, victory; the embittered, revenge; the stupid, from misguided notions; the shameless, from indifference.\n\nWe have partly discussed this under virtues and will discuss it further under emotions. Now let us consider motives and victims.\n\nFirst, what do people try to get or avoid when wronging others? The prosecutor must consider which inducements affect his adversary; the defendant, which do not. Every action is due either to the person himself or not. Actions not due to himself are due to chance, necessity (compulsion), or nature. Actions due to himself are due to habit or craving (rational or irrational). Rational craving is a wish for good. Irrational craving is anger or appetite.\n\nThus, every action springs from one of seven causes: chance, nature, compulsion, habit, reasoning, anger, or appetite. Distinctions based on age or condition are superfluous. Young men act from anger or appetite, not youth. Poor men crave money from appetite, not poverty. Just and unjust men act from reasoning or emotion. However, certain actions and people usually go together. Accessory qualities like wealth or luck are important.\n\nChance events have no determined cause, no purpose, and no regularity. Natural events have a fixed internal cause and occur uniformly. Compelled events happen contrary to desire, through the doer's agency. Habitual acts are done from frequent repetition. Reasoned acts aim at a useful end (real or apparent). Anger causes acts of revenge. Punishment aims at the offender's good; revenge, at the punisher's satisfaction. Appetite causes all acts that appear pleasant. Habit also makes things pleasant.\n\nTo sum up: all voluntary actions either are or seem good or pleasant. I count escape from evil as a good, and escape from pain as a pleasure. We must therefore ascertain what is useful and what is pleasant. We have discussed the useful; now for the pleasant.\n\nPleasure is a movement bringing the soul consciously into its normal state; pain is the opposite. Thus, what produces this condition is pleasant; what destroys it is painful. Moving toward a natural state is pleasant, especially when the process completes recovery. Habits are pleasant because the habitual becomes natural; the often is akin to the always.\n\nWhat is unforced is pleasant. Force is unnatural and painful; \"All that is done on compulsion is bitterness unto the soul.\" Acts of concentration and effort are painful unless habitual. Ease, relaxation, amusement, rest, and sleep are pleasant because they are uncompelled. Satisfied desires are pleasant. Irrational desires (thirst, hunger, sex) originate in the body. Rational desires arise from opinion; we desire what we are told is good.\n\nPleasure is conscious emotion. Imagination is feeble sensation; memory and expectation retain images. Thus, memory and expectation are accompanied by sensation and pleasure. We enjoy present things, remember past ones, and expect future ones. Remembering is pleasant, even of past pains, if the results were noble. \"Sweet 'tis when rescued to remember pain.\" Being free from evil is pleasant.\n\nExpecting delight or benefit is pleasant. Generally, what delights in the present delights in memory or expectation. Even anger is pleasant—\"sweeter than honeycomb\"—because we enjoy the prospect of vengeance. We do not get angry where vengeance is impossible.\n\nMost appetites involve pleasure in memory or expectation. Fever patients enjoy remembering drinks. Lovers enjoy talking or writing about the beloved, recalling him to the imagination. Love begins when one feels pain at absence and pleasure in memory. Even mourning has pleasure; we grieve the loss but enjoy remembering the person. \"He spake, and in each man's heart he awakened the love of lament.\"\n\nRevenge is pleasant. Failing to get it is painful; expecting it is pleasant. Victory is pleasant to everyone, not just bad losers; the winner sees himself as a champion. Thus, combative sports, games, and hunting are pleasant. Where there is competition, there is victory. Debating is pleasant to those with capacity for it.\n\nHonour and good repute are highly pleasant. They make a man see himself as fine, especially when credited by good judges—neighbors, associates, contemporaries, the sensible. We value honour from those we esteem, not from children or animals.\n\nFriends are pleasant. Loving is pleasant (like loving wine). Being loved is pleasant; it confirms one's goodness. To be admired is pleasant for the honour. Flattery is pleasant because the flatterer seems to admire and like us.\n\nRepetition is pleasant (habit). Change is also pleasant (nature). Invariable repetition causes excess. \"Change is in all things sweet.\" Rare things are pleasant. Learning and wondering are pleasant; wondering implies a desire to learn. Imitation (painting, sculpture, poetry) is pleasant even if the object is unpleasant; we learn by inferring \"That is so-and-so.\" Dramatic turns and escapes are pleasant because they are wonderful.\n\nKinship is pleasant. Like delights like (\"jackdaw to jackdaw\"). Since every man is akin to himself, self-love is natural. We love our own deeds, words, and children. Completing what is defective is pleasant; the result becomes our own work. Power and wisdom are pleasant. Disparaging neighbors is pleasant to the ambitious. Doing what one does best is pleasant. \"To that he bends himself... wherein he is indeed the best part of himself.\" Amusement, relaxation, and laughter are pleasant; hence the ludicrous is pleasant. We discuss this in the Poetics.\n\nSo much for pleasant things. Their opposites are unpleasant.\n\nThese are the motives for wrongdoing. We must next consider the wrongdoer's state of mind and the persons he wrongs.\n\nWrongdoers must believe they can do the deed, either secretly or with impunity, or that the gain outweighs the punishment. We will discuss apparent possibility later. Men think they can wrong others with impunity if they possess eloquence, practical ability, legal experience, many friends, or money. They feel safest if they have these advantages personally; if not, they rely on friends or partners. They also feel safe if they are on good terms with their victims or the judges. Victims on good terms are off their guard and settle easily; judges favor friends and impose light sentences.\n\nThey avoid detection if their appearance contradicts the charge: a weakling is unlikely to be charged with assault, or an ugly man with adultery. Public and open injuries are easy because nobody expects them and therefore nobody guards against them. The same applies to terrible crimes; nobody guards against a disease nobody has ever had.\n\nYou feel safe if you have no enemies or many. If none, you are unwatched; if many, people think you would not risk it, and you can plead that you never would have. You may also trust to the way or place of the crime, or to means of disposal.\n\nYou may feel you can postpone a trial, corrupt judges, or avoid paying damages. You may have nothing to lose. You may see the gain as great, certain, and immediate, and the penalty as small, uncertain, or distant. Or the gain may outweigh any retribution, as with despotic power. You may profit solidly while suffering only bad names. Conversely, the crime may bring credit (avenging a parent) while the penalty is merely a fine.\n\nPeople are led by either motive, but not by both; they affect opposite characters. You may be encouraged by past escapes or by past failures (refusing to give up). Weak-willed persons prefer immediate pleasure and later pain; sensible persons prefer immediate pain and later profit. You may make the crime appear due to chance, necessity, or habit—as if you failed to do right rather than did wrong. You may trust to equitable judgment, or be stimulated by want (of necessaries or luxuries). A good reputation saves you from suspicion; a bad one means nothing can make it worse.\n\nSuch are the wrongdoer's states of mind. Now for the victims and the methods. People wrong those who have what they want. Victims may be near (quick profit) or far (slow vengeance). They may be trustful (easy to elude), easy-going (too lazy to prosecute), sensitive (avoiding money fights), or already wronged and silent (the \"Mysian prey\"). They may be those never wronged (unguarded) or often wronged (expecting no more).\n\nThey wrong those with attacked characters, who fear judges. They wrong those they can pretend treated them badly; wickedness needs only a pretext. They wrong enemies because it is pleasant, and friends because it is easy. They wrong the friendless and the ineloquent. They wrong foreigners and small farmers, who settle for a trifle. They wrong those who have wronged others; this feels like no wrong at all.\n\nThey wrong those who have done or intended wrong, for it seems fine to wrong them. They wrong those to gratify friends, masters, or admirers. They wrong those from whom they expect equitable treatment. They wrong those against whom they have a grievance (like Callippus to Dion). They wrong those about to be wronged by others, to forestall them (like Aenesidemus and Gelon). They wrong others to do many righteous acts, curing the harm easily (as Jason said).\n\nThey commit common wrongs, expecting forgiveness. They commit wrongs easily kept dark—involving consumables, changeables, or portables. They commit wrongs the victim is ashamed to speak of (outrages to women or self). They commit trifling wrongs that appear litigious to prosecute.\n\nThis covers the circumstances, nature, victims, and reasons of wrongdoing.\n\nWe must classify just and unjust actions. They are defined by two kinds of law and two classes of persons. Law is particular or universal. Particular law is what a community lays down for itself, written or unwritten. Universal law is the law of Nature. There is a natural justice binding on all men, even without covenant. Sophocles' Antigone appeals to this when she calls burying Polyneices just by nature: \"Not of to-day or yesterday it is, But lives eternal...\" Empedocles says killing no living creature is an all-embracing law.\n\nActions affect either the community or a member of it. Thus, we can do right or wrong toward a definite person or toward the community. Adultery and assault wrong a person; draft evasion wrongs the community.\n\nThus, unjust actions affect either the community or an individual. \"Being wronged\" implies intentional injury. To be wronged, a man must suffer actual harm against his will. The forms of harm correspond to goods and evils. Every accusation concerns an action affecting the community or an individual. The doer must either intend the action or not. Intentional acts spring from deliberate choice or passion.\n\nOften a man admits the act but denies the label. He took a thing, but did not steal it; struck first, but committed no outrage. We must distinguish theft, outrage, and adultery from simple acts. Deliberate purpose constitutes criminal guilt. A blow is outrage only if meant to insult. Taking is theft only if meant to injure the owner and keep the object.\n\nWe have discussed written ordinances. Unwritten law has two varieties. First, conduct springing from exceptional goodness or badness, bringing honor or censure (e.g., gratitude, helping friends). Second, equity. Equity makes up for defects in written law. It is just, but goes beyond the written law. Legislators sometimes omit it inadvertently, or because they cannot define things exactly. They must legislate generally, though the rule only holds usually. If a precise statement is impossible, the law uses wide terms. Thus, a man lifting a finger-ring to strike is guilty by the letter, but innocent by equity.\n\nEquity applies to forgivable actions. It distinguishes errors and misfortunes from crimes. A misfortune has unexpected results not due to vice. An error has expected results not due to vice. A crime has expected results due to vice. Equity bids us be merciful to human weakness; to look to the legislator's meaning, not his words; to the intention, not the act; to the whole story, not the detail; to the man's past, not his present. It bids us remember benefits received; to be patient when wronged; to prefer arbitration to litigation, for the arbitrator looks to equity, the judge to law.\n\nThe worse act springs from the worse disposition. Thus, trifling acts may be the worst. Callistratus charged Melanopus with cheating temple-builders of three half-obols; the potential crime was great. Conversely, the worse act is sometimes the one causing greater harm.\n\nRhetorically, we may argue that the accused broke many obligations—oaths, promises, pledges, rights. Or that he committed the crime in a place of punishment (a law court), showing he would commit it anywhere.\n\nThe deed is worse if it involves special shame, or wrongs benefactors (harming those he should help). It is worse if it breaks unwritten laws, for the better man is just voluntarily, not by force. Conversely, it may be worse if it breaks written laws, for he who defies terrible penalties will not hesitate where there are none.\n\nWe must cursorily view the five \"non-technical\" means of persuasion: laws, witnesses, contracts, tortures, and oaths.\n\nFirst, laws. If the written law opposes our case, appeal to the universal law and equity. Argue that \"honest opinion\" means not following the written law blindly. Urge that equity and universal law are changeless and natural, unlike written laws (as Antigone argued). Argue that true justice is profitable; sham justice (bad law) is not. Law is like silver; judges must assay it. The better man follows unwritten law. Or argue the law contradicts another law or itself. Or interpret ambiguity in favor of justice. Or argue the law's occasion has passed.\n\nIf the written law supports us, argue that \"honest opinion\" prevents perjury, not lawlessness. No one chooses absolute good, but good for himself. Not using laws is having no laws. It does not pay to be cleverer than the doctor or the laws.\n\nWitnesses are ancient (poets, notables) or recent (risk-sharers). Athenians appealed to Homer; Themistocles to an oracle. Proverbs are evidence. Recent witnesses are well-known people whose opinions support us. Witnesses sharing the risk validly attest facts, not quality. For quality, detached persons are trustworthy. Ancient witnesses are most trustworthy, being incorruptible.\n\nIf you have no witnesses, argue that judges must decide by probabilities, which cannot be bribed or perjure themselves. If you have witnesses, argue that probabilities cannot be cross-examined and that witnesses make the case clearer.\n\nEvidence may refer to us or our opponent, to fact or character. We can always find evidence of our worth or our opponent's worthlessness. Arguments about a witness's friendship, enmity, or reputation follow general lines.\n\nConfirm or upset contracts like witnesses. If the contract supports us, insist on its importance. A contract is a special law; disregarding it undermines the law and human intercourse. If it opposes us, use arguments against bad laws. The judge seeks justice, not just legality. Fraud or force invalidates a contract. Check if it contravenes laws or other contracts, or if it harms the judges' interests.\n\nTorture is evidence by compulsion. If it helps us, argue it is infallible. If it hurts us, argue that people lie under torture to end the pain, often falsely accusing. Quote familiar cases.\n\nOaths offer four possibilities: offer and accept, neither, or one without the other.\n\nIf you refuse to offer an oath, argue that men perjure themselves. You trust the judges more than your opponent.\n\nIf you refuse to accept an oath, argue that an oath is always paid for. If you were a rascal, you would swear for gain; your refusal shows high principle. \"Tis not fair that he who fears not God should challenge him who doth.\"\n\nIf you accept an oath, argue you trust yourself, not your opponent. It is fair for the impious to offer and the pious to accept. It is monstrous to refuse an oath when you ask judges to swear.\n\nIf you offer an oath, argue that piety leaves the issue to the gods. Your opponent should not want other judges than himself.\n\nCombine these arguments for mixed cases.\n\nIf you have sworn a contradictory oath, argue it is not perjury, for crime requires voluntary intent. Perjury depends on intention, not words. If your opponent has done so, argue he is an enemy of society who defies the laws.\n\nSo much for non-technical persuasion.\n\nWe have considered the materials for political, ceremonial, and forensic oratory—the received opinions on which we base our arguments.\n\nSince rhetoric exists to affect decisions, the orator must not only demonstrate his argument but also present his character rightly and put the audience into the right frame of mind. Character matters most in politics; emotion, in lawsuits. Friendly hearers judge differently from hostile ones. To the friendly, the accused seems innocent; to the hostile, guilty. Eager hearers expect success; indifferent ones do not.\n\nThree things inspire confidence in the orator's character: good sense, good moral character, and goodwill. False statements or bad advice spring from the lack of these. Men may lack sense; or they may have sense but lack integrity, concealing their true thoughts; or they may have both but lack goodwill, failing to recommend the best course. These are the only causes. Therefore, he who appears to possess all three inspires trust. We have analyzed good sense and character in our discussion of virtues. We must now discuss goodwill and friendliness under the head of emotions.\n\nEmotions are feelings that change men so as to affect their judgments, attended by pain or pleasure. Examples are anger, pity, and fear. We must analyze each under three heads: the state of mind, the people causing it, and the grounds. Unless we know all three, we cannot arouse emotion. Let us proceed.\n\nAnger is an impulse, accompanied by pain, to a conspicuous revenge for a conspicuous slight directed without justification toward oneself or one's friends. It is always felt toward a particular individual, not \"man\" in general. It arises because the other has done or intended something to him or his friends. It is always attended by pleasure—the expectation of revenge. The angry man aims at what he can attain, and the belief in attainment is pleasant. \"Sweeter it is by far than the honeycomb...\" The thoughts dwell on the act of vengeance, causing pleasure like dreams.\n\nSlighting is the active opinion that something is unimportant. We consider bad and good things important; we slight what has no such tendency. There are three kinds of slighting: contempt, spite, and insolence. Contempt slights the unimportant. Spite thwarts another's wishes, not for gain but to prevent his gain. Spite arises because you do not fear him (or you would not slight him) nor respect him (or you would want his friendship). Insolence shames the victim, not for gain, but for pleasure. The insolent man feels superior. Youth and rich men are insolent. Robbing people of honour is a form of insolence. Achilles says: \"He hath taken my prize... and hath done me dishonour.\" A man expects respect from inferiors in birth, capacity, or goodness. \"Great is the wrath of kings...\" He also expects it from those he has treated well.\n\nEvidently, we get angry when we are in pain. In this condition, we always aim at something. If anyone opposes us—preventing us from drinking when thirsty—we get angry. Sickness, poverty, love, thirst, or any unsatisfied desire makes us prone to anger, especially against those who slight our distress. The sick man is angered by disregard of his illness; the lover, by disregard of his love. Each man's emotion predisposes him to his particular anger. We are also angered by unexpected results; unexpected evil is especially painful.\n\nThese are the frames of mind. We get angry with those who laugh or mock at us (insolence). With those who inflict insolent injuries (neither retaliatory nor profitable). With those who despise what we care about (philosophy, appearance), especially if we suspect we lack the quality. With friends who treat us badly or fail to return kindnesses. With inferiors who oppose us (they seem to despise us). We get angry with men of no account if they slight us. We get angry with friends who do not speak well of us, or fail to perceive our needs (like Plexippus with Meleager); this shows negligence. We get angry with those who rejoice at our misfortunes or are indifferent to our pain (bringers of bad news). With those who listen to stories about our weaknesses. With those who slight us before rivals, admirers, or those we revere. With those who slight those we must champion (parents, children). With those who do not return a favor. With those who reply with levity to seriousness. With those who treat us less well than others. With those who forget our names; forgetfulness shows negligence, and negligence is slighting.\n\nWe have set forth the persons, frame of mind, and reasons for anger. The orator must bring his hearers into a frame of mind disposed to anger, and show his adversaries as deserving it.\n\nCalmness is the settling down of anger. We feel calm toward those who do not slight us, or do so involuntarily, or intended the opposite. We feel calm toward those who treat themselves as they treated us (no one slights himself). We feel calm toward those who admit their fault and regret it; we accept their grief as satisfaction. We punish servants who deny their fault, but forgive those who admit it. Denial is shameless; admission is humble. We feel calm toward those who humble themselves, for they admit inferiority and fear, and fear precludes slighting. Even dogs do not bite those who sit down. We feel calm toward those serious when we are serious; toward benefactors; toward suppliants. We feel calm toward those who do not insult worthy people. We are not angry with those we fear or respect. We are not angry with those who acted from anger, for they did not slight us (slighting is painless, anger is painful).\n\nPeople are calm when amused, laughing, feasting, prosperous, or satisfied—when free from pain. Time also calms anger. Vengeance on one person calms anger against another. Philocrates said, \"I will defend myself when I see someone else calumniated.\" The people acquitted Ergophilus because they had just condemned Callisthenes. Men become calm if the offender is convicted or suffers worse than they would have inflicted; they feel avenged. They become calm if they feel they are in the wrong and suffer justly. We should inflict a preliminary punishment in words to satisfy this feeling. We become calm if the offender will not know we punished him. Anger requires individual recognition. Odysseus insisted the Cyclops know who blinded him. We cease to be angry with the dead, who feel no pain. As Apollo said of Achilles abusing Hector: \"For behold in his fury he doeth despite to the senseless clay.\"\n\nTo calm others, use these arguments. Put the hearers into the right frame of mind. Represent those they are angry with as formidable, worthy of reverence, benefactors, involuntary agents, or deeply distressed.\n\nLet us now discuss Friendship and Enmity. We define friendly feeling as wishing for another what you believe to be good, for his sake, and trying to bring it about. A friend feels this and excites it in return. A friend shares your pleasure in good and your pain in unpleasantness, for your sake. This shared feeling is the token of good wishes; we are glad when we get what we wish, and pained when we do not.\n\nFriends share the same views on good and evil. They are friendly or unfriendly to the same people. Thus, they wish for each other what they wish for themselves. We feel friendly to benefactors (of ourselves or those we care for), provided the kindness was for our sake. We like those who wish to treat us well. We like our friends' friends and those who like whom we like. We like those who dislike whom we dislike; they share our view of good, so they wish us good.\n\nWe like those willing to treat us well in money or safety—the liberal, brave, and just. The just do not live on others; they work, like farmers. We like temperate men because they are not unjust. We like those who mind their own business. We like those who wish to be our friends, if they are morally good or well thought of. We like those pleasant to live with: the good-tempered, the uncritical, the unquarrelsome (quarrelers seem to wish the opposite of our wishes), and those who can make and take a joke.\n\nWe like those who praise our good qualities, especially those we doubt we possess. We like the cleanly. We like those who do not reproach us or nurse grudges, but are ready to make up. We like those who are not evil speakers, who see only our good points. We like those who do not thwart us when angry or earnest. We like those who admire us, believe in our goodness, or enjoy our company, especially regarding qualities we wish admired. We like those like ourselves in character and occupation, provided they do not compete with us (\"Potter to potter... begrudge their reward\").\n\nWe like those who desire what we desire, if we can share it; otherwise, trouble arises. We like those before whom we can do wrong without blushing (respecting their opinion but trusting them), and those before whom we would be ashamed to do wrong. We like rivals we wish to envy us without ill-feeling. We like those we help, if we do not suffer heavily. We like those faithful in our absence; hence we love those faithful to the dead. We like those who do not desert friends in trouble. We like those honest with us about their own weaknesses. We like those who do not frighten us.\n\nFriendship has forms like comradeship, intimacy, and kinship.\n\nCauses of friendship are doing kindnesses, doing them unasked, and not proclaiming them.\n\nEnmity and Hatred are opposite to friendship. Enmity springs from anger, spite, or calumny. Anger arises from offences against oneself; enmity may arise from character alone. We hate thieves and informers generally. Anger is cured by time; hatred is not. Anger aims at pain; hatred, at harm. The angry man wants his victim to feel; the hater does not care. Pain is felt; the greatest evils (injustice, folly) are not. Anger involves pain; hatred does not. The angry man may pity; the hater never pities, for he wishes the object's destruction.\n\nThus we can prove people friends or enemies, or refute such claims, or attribute actions to anger or hatred as preferred.\n\nLet us discuss Fear. Fear is a pain or disturbance due to a mental picture of some destructive or painful evil in the future. We fear only imminent, great pains or losses, not remote ones (like death) or painless evils (like stupidity).\n\nFear is caused by whatever has the power to destroy or greatly harm us. Indications of such things are terrible, implying danger. We fear the enmity and anger of the powerful, for they are ready to act. We fear injustice possessed of power. We fear outraged virtue possessing power (it wishes to retaliate). We fear those who fear us (they are ready to strike). We fear being at another's mercy, especially if we have done something horrible; accomplices may betray us. We fear those who can wrong us, for men usually wrong others when they can. We fear those we have wronged, for they watch for opportunity. We fear powerful wrongdoers, for they fear retaliation. We fear rivals. We fear those feared by stronger people, and those who have destroyed stronger people. We fear those attacking the weak; they will soon be stronger.\n\nWe fear the quiet, dissembling, unscrupulous enemy more than the outspoken one; we never know when he will strike. Terrible things are worse if mistakes are irretrievable or remediable only by enemies. Things we cannot help are terrible. Generally, we fear what we pity in others.\n\nTo feel fear, we must believe something destructive is likely to happen to us, from particular persons, at a particular time. Those in great prosperity (insolent, reckless) do not fear. Those who have experienced every horror (callous) do not fear; fear requires some faint hope of escape. Fear sets us thinking what to do; hopelessness does not.\n\nTherefore, the orator must make the audience feel they are in danger. He must show that stronger people have suffered, and that people like themselves are suffering unexpectedly.\n\nConfidence is the opposite of fear. It is the expectation of safety and the absence of terror. We feel confident if we can cure or prevent trouble; if we have neither wronged nor been wronged; if we have no strong rivals, or if our strong rivals are friends. We feel confident if our interest aligns with the stronger or more numerous party.\n\nWe feel confident if we have often succeeded or escaped danger. Men face danger calmly from inexperience or from possession of means. We feel confident if our equals or inferiors are not afraid, or if we have conquered our superiors. We feel confident if we possess more formidable advantages (wealth, strength, territory) than our rivals. We feel confident if we have wronged no one, or at least not the formidable. We feel confident if our relations with the gods are satisfactory; anger makes us confident because we believe the gods side with the wronged. We feel confident if we believe we cannot fail.\n\nShame is pain or disturbance regarding bad things, present, past, or future, which seem likely to involve discredit. Shamelessness is indifference to these things. We feel shame at things disgraceful to ourselves or those we care for.\n\nDisgraceful things include those due to vice: throwing away a shield (cowardice); wronging people about money (injustice); forbidden intercourse (licentiousness); making petty profit from the poor or dead (greed); giving little help or accepting help from the poor; begging like a loan or asking a return like a beggar; praising to beg; persisting after failure (meanness). Flattery is disgraceful: praising a man to his face, glozing his weaknesses. Effeminacy is disgraceful: unable to endure what the old or delicate endure. Accepting benefits often and abusing the giver is mean. Boastfulness is talking incessantly of oneself.\n\nWe feel shame at lacking honourable things shared by our equals (race, country, family, age). It is worse if the lack is our own fault. We feel shame at suffering dishonourable acts, like submitting to outrage. Yielding to lust is shameful, willing or unwilling; unresisting submission shows unmanliness.\n\nWe feel shame before those whose opinion matters: those we admire, those who admire us, those we wish to admire us, rivals, and those whose opinion we respect (the sensible, elders, educated). We feel more shame if the act is open; \"shame dwells in the eyes.\" We feel shame before those always present or observant; before those innocent of the same fault (their opinion is opposite); before those hard on others; before those who tell tales (evil-speakers, satirists, wronged persons). We feel shame before those who have not seen us come to grief, especially those just beginning to be friends. We are ashamed of the evidences of guilt as well as the acts. We are ashamed before those who will tell others. We are not ashamed before those we despise (children, animals). We are ashamed of genuine faults before intimates, and conventional ones before strangers.\n\nWe feel shame when the people mentioned are looking on or near. We do not wish to be seen in misfortune by those who once envied us. We feel shame at bringing dishonour on our own or our ancestors' exploits. We feel shame before those who model themselves on us. We feel more shame if we must live continually with those who know our disgrace. Antiphon asked those covering their faces before execution: \"Why cover your faces? Is it lest some of these spectators should see you to-morrow?\"\n\nKindness is helpfulness toward someone in need, not for return or for the helper's advantage, but for that of the person helped. Kindness is great if the need is great (important, hard to get, or at a crisis), or if the helper is the only, first, or chief one to help. Needs arise from natural cravings accompanied by pain, such as appetites in danger and pain. Hence small help in great need (poverty, banishment) is real kindness.\n\nWe must argue that the persons helped are in such need and the helpers meet it. To eliminate the idea of kindness, argue that the helpers acted for their own interest, or accidentally, or under compulsion. Or that they were merely returning a favor; a return is not a kindness. Consider all categories: substance, magnitude, quality, time, place. Point out if they refused a smaller service before, or helped enemies more. Or if the thing given was worthless and they knew it; no one needs the worthless.\n\nPity is a feeling of pain at the sight of destructive or painful evil befalling one who does not deserve it, which we might expect to befall ourselves or a friend soon. To feel pity, we must be capable of supposing evil may happen to us. Those completely ruined do not feel it (they have nothing worse to fear); nor do those who think themselves immensely fortunate (they think they are safe).\n\nThose who fear evil are: those who have escaped it; the elderly (from experience); the weak (cowards); the educated (who take long views); those with parents, wives, or children (who are vulnerable). Also those not moved by courage (anger, confidence) or insolence (who ignore danger) or panic (who fear only for themselves). We must also believe some people are good; if we think nobody good, we think everyone deserves evil. Generally, we pity when we remember similar past misfortunes or expect future ones.\n\nWe pity destructive or painful evils: death, bodily injury, old age, disease, lack of food. Also evils due to chance: friendlessness, deformity, weakness, mutilation, disappointment (evil whence good was expected), repeated misfortune. Also good coming too late (gifts for Diopeithes after death), or inability to enjoy good fortune.\n\nWe pity those we know, but not too closely; for close relations, we feel terror, not pity. Amasis wept for his friend begging, not his son dying; the latter was terrible. The terrible casts out pity. We pity those like us in age, character, disposition, standing, or birth; their misfortune seems likely to befall us. What we fear for ourselves, we pity in others.\n\nSince proximity excites pity, those who use gestures, tones, and dress to visualize the disaster succeed best. They make it seem close, just past or coming. Tokens (garments) and actions of sufferers are piteous. Most piteous is when noble persons suffer; their innocence and the vividness make the misfortune seem close.\n\nIndignation is the opposite of pity. It is pain at unmerited good fortune, just as pity is pain at unmerited bad fortune. Both spring from good character; we should sympathize with unmerited distress and resent unmerited prosperity, for the undeserved is unjust. Envy is akin to indignation but distinct. Envy is pain at the prosperity of equals; indignation is pain at the prosperity of the undeserving. If we fear the other's prosperity will harm us, the feeling becomes fear.\n\nOpposite feelings attend pity and indignation. If we are pained by unmerited distress, we are pleased, or at least not pained, by merited distress (punishment). We rejoice at the prosperity of the deserving. These feelings belong to the same moral character. The malicious man, delighted by others' misfortunes, is identical with the envious man. He who is pained by a thing's existence is pleased by its destruction. All these feelings neutralize pity.\n\nIndignation is pain at undeserved good fortune. We are not indignant at a man for being just or brave; we are indignant at wealth, power, or beauty when undeserved. We are more indignant if the possessor has only just got it; the newly rich offend more than the heirs of old wealth. What is long established seems natural and real.\n\nWe are indignant when anyone gets what is inappropriate. Brave men deserve fine weapons; men of family deserve distinguished marriages. We are indignant when an inferior contends with a superior, especially in the superior's own field.\n\nWe feel indignation if we deserve and have great goods, for it is unjust that inferiors should equal us. We feel it if we are good and honest, loathing injustice. We feel it if we are ambitious for what others get undeservedly. Generally, if we think we deserve a thing and others do not, we are indignant. Servile and unambitious men are not indignant, for they think they deserve nothing.\n\nIf the speech puts the judges into this frame of mind and shows the claimant deserves no pity, they will feel none.\n\nEnvy is pain at the good fortune of equals—not because we want it, but because they have it. Equals are those comparable in birth, relationship, age, disposition, distinction, or wealth. We feel it if we fall just short of having everything; hence the high-placed are envious, thinking others take what is theirs.\n\nAmbitious men are more envious than others; so are the small-minded, to whom everything seems great. We envy things that bring honor and fame. We envy those near us in time, place, age, or reputation. \"Kin can even be jealous of their kin.\" We envy rivals in sport or love. \"Potter against potter.\"\n\nWe envy those whose success is a reproach to us (our equals), showing we missed the good thing by our own fault. We envy those who have what we ought to have, or once had. Old men envy the young; the spendthrift envies the thrifty.\n\nEmulation is pain caused by seeing the presence, in persons like ourselves, of highly valued good things possible for us to acquire. It is felt not because others have them, but because we do not. It is a good feeling felt by good persons; envy is a bad feeling felt by bad persons. Emulation moves us to secure the goods; envy moves us to stop our neighbor from having them.\n\nEmulation is felt by those who believe they deserve good things they lack. No one aspires to the impossible. It is felt by the young and the lofty-minded. Also by those possessing honourable goods (wealth, friends, office), who feel they ought to be good men and therefore deserve such goods. Also by those whom others think deserving. We emulate others in things for which our ancestors or friends are honoured, feeling we deserve them.\n\nObjects of emulation are moral goodness and things useful to others, for men honour the good and the helpful. Also goods that give enjoyment to neighbors, like wealth and beauty.\n\nObjects of emulation are persons who possess these things—courage, wisdom, office. Generals and orators can help many. We emulate those whom many wish to be like, who have many friends, whom we admire, or whom poets praise.\n\nOpposite to emulation is contempt. We despise those subject to bad things contrary to the objects of emulation. We often despise the fortunate who lack honourable goods.\n\nThis completes our discussion of the emotions.\n\nLet us consider character in relation to emotions and moral qualities, corresponding to age and fortune. Ages are youth, prime, and old age. Fortune is birth, wealth, power, and their opposites.\n\nYoung men have strong passions and gratify them indiscriminately. They are swayed most by sexual desire, lacking self-control. Their desires are changeable, fickle, and violent but short-lived; their impulses are keen but not deep. They are hot-tempered, quick to anger, and unable to bear slights, loving honour and victory more than money. They love victory because they desire superiority. They love money little, having never known want.\n\nThey are optimistic, trusting others readily because they have not been cheated often. Nature warms their blood like wine. They live in expectation, not memory; youth has a long future and a short past. This makes them easily cheated. Their hot tempers and hopefulness make them courageous; anger prevents fear, and hope creates confidence. They are shy, accepting social rules. They have exalted notions, not yet humbled by life. They prefer noble deeds to useful ones, living by feeling rather than reasoning. They are fond of friends and companions for the sake of company, not utility.\n\nThey overdo everything, loving and hating too much. They think they know everything and are sure of it. Their wrongs are insults, not malice. They pity others, thinking everyone better than he is, judging by their own harmless natures. They are fond of fun and witty, for wit is well-bred insolence.\n\nElderly men are the contrary. Having lived long and been often deceived, they are sure about nothing and under-do everything. They \"think\" but never \"know,\" always adding \"possibly\" or \"perhaps.\" They are cynical, putting the worse construction on everything. They are suspicious and therefore distrustful. They neither love warmly nor hate bitterly; they love as if they will some day hate, and hate as if they will some day love.\n\nThey are small-minded, having been humbled by life; they desire only what keeps them alive. They are not generous; experience has taught them money is hard to get and easy to lose. They are cowardly and always anticipating danger; old age paves the way for cowardice, for fear is a chill. They love life, especially at the end, desiring most what they lack. They are selfish, guiding their lives by the useful rather than the noble. They are shameless, caring less for opinion than for profit.\n\nThey lack confidence, partly from experience (things go wrong), partly from cowardice. They live by memory, not hope; the past is long, the future short. This makes them loquacious; they enjoy remembering. Their anger is sudden but feeble. Their passions are weak or gone; they are guided by the love of gain. They seem self-controlled because their passions have slackened and they are slaves to gain. They live by reasoning (utility), not moral feeling (goodness). Their wrongs are injuries, not insults. They pity out of weakness, imagining every evil may befall them. They are querulous, not witty.\n\nSuch are the characters of young and elderly men. People approve speeches reflecting their own character; we can now adapt our speeches accordingly.\n\nMen in their prime have a character between the young and the old, free from the extremes of either. They have neither rash confidence nor excessive timidity, but the right amount of each. They neither trust nor distrust everybody, but judge correctly. They guide their lives by both the noble and the useful, neither parsimonious nor prodigal, but fitting. They are brave as well as temperate, and temperate as well as brave. Young men are brave but intemperate; old men, temperate but cowardly. The prime of life unites the valuable qualities of both and replaces their excesses with moderation. The body is in its prime from thirty to thirty-five; the mind, about forty-nine.\n\nNow let us consider the Gifts of Fortune and their effect on character. First, Good Birth. It makes men ambitious; men with a start in life wish to add to it. Good birth implies ancestral distinction. The well-born look down even on those as good as their ancestors, for distant distinction seems greater than recent. Being well-born (coming from fine stock) differs from nobility (being true to the family nature). Most well-born men are poor creatures. Like fruits of the earth, families have varying yields. A good stock produces exceptional men for a while, then degenerates. Clever stocks degenerate toward insanity (Alcibiades, Dionysius); steady stocks toward stupidity (Cimon, Pericles, Socrates).\n\nWealth produces a character easy to see. Wealthy men are insolent and arrogant, affected by their possessions. They feel they have every good thing; wealth becomes the standard of value, and they imagine it buys everything. They are luxurious and ostentatious. Luxurious from living in prosperity; ostentatious and vulgar because they think everyone admires what they admire. Naturally, many beg from them. As Simonides told Hiero's wife, it is better to be rich than wise, \"for I see the wise men spending their days at the rich men's doors.\"\n\nRich men consider themselves worthy of public office, thinking they possess what gives a claim to it. In short, the wealthy character is that of a prosperous fool. The newly rich are worse than the old rich; they lack education in riches. Their wrongs spring from insolence or self-indulgence, not malice—assault or adultery.\n\nPower produces a character partly like the wealthy, partly better. The powerful are more ambitious and manly, aspiring to great deeds. Responsibility makes them serious. They are dignified rather than arrogant—dignity being mild arrogance. Their wrongs are great, not small.\n\nGood fortune produces characters like those described, since these conditions are forms of good fortune. It leads us to gain family happiness and bodily advantages. It makes men supercilious and reckless, but also pious, respecting the divine power because of their luck.\n\nThe characters of the poor, unfortunate, and powerless are the opposites of those described.\n\nPersuasive speech leads to decisions. Even when addressing a single person (as in scolding), he is your judge. In arguing against a proposition, we still attack arguments as if they were opponents. In ceremonial speeches, onlookers are judges. Strictly, a judge decides public controversies (lawsuits, debates). We have already discussed the characters marking different constitutions.\n\nWe have now set forth how to invest speeches with moral character.\n\nWe have noted the special arguments for each division of oratory—political, ceremonial, and forensic. We must now discuss arguments common to all: Possible and Impossible, Past and Future, and Size (Amplification). Amplification suits ceremonial speeches; the Past, forensic; Possibility and the Future, political.\n\nLet us discuss the Possible and Impossible.\n\nFor Impossibility, use the contrary arguments.\n\nFor Greatness and Smallness (Amplification), use the arguments from deliberative oratory on relative goods. Every orator amplifies utility, nobleness, or justice. Practical facts count more than abstract laws.\n\nArgument by Example has the nature of induction. It has two varieties: mentioning actual past facts, or inventing facts. Invention includes illustrative parallels and fables (like Aesop's).\n\nActual fact: \"We must prepare for war against Persia and not let him subdue Egypt. Darius did not cross the Aegean until he seized Egypt; Xerxes did not attack until he seized Egypt. If the present king seizes Egypt, he will cross.\"\n\nIllustrative parallel (Socrates): \"Public officials should not be selected by lot. That is like selecting athletes by lot instead of by fitness, or steersmen by lot instead of by skill.\"\n\nFables: Stesichorus told the people of Himera, who were giving Phalaris a bodyguard, the fable of the horse and the stag. The horse, wishing to revenge himself on the stag, let a man bridle and mount him. He got his revenge but became a slave. \"Take care,\" said Stesichorus, \"lest in your desire for revenge you become slaves to Phalaris.\"\n\nAesop told the Samians the fable of the fox and the fleas. A fox, stuck in a river, declined a hedgehog's offer to remove her fleas. \"These are full,\" she said; \"fresh ones would drink all my blood.\" Aesop applied this to a popular leader: \"He is wealthy; if you kill him, poor men will come and empty your treasury.\"\n\nFables are easy to invent and suitable for popular addresses. However, actual past events are more valuable for political speakers, since the future usually resembles the past.\n\nIf we cannot argue by Enthymeme, we must use Examples as demonstration. If we can, we should use Examples as supplementary evidence following the Enthymeme. Preceding examples look like induction; following examples look like witnesses. If first, use many; if last, one is sufficient.\n\nA Maxim is a general statement about practical conduct, concerning what should be chosen or avoided. Since Enthymemes deal with such subjects, their premises or conclusions are often maxims. \"Never should any man... Have his sons taught more wisdom than their fellows\" is a maxim; add the reason (\"It makes them idle...\"), and it becomes an Enthymeme.\n\nMaxims may or may not have a supplement. Paradoxical or disputable maxims need proof. Known truths or self-evident views do not. \"Chiefest of blessings is health...\" is a known truth. \"No love is true save that which loves for ever\" is self-evident.\n\nSome maxims with supplements are part of an Enthymeme. Others are Enthymemes in essence but not form; these are the best. \"O mortal man, nurse not immortal wrath.\" The word \"mortal\" implies the reason.\n\nIf a view is paradoxical, put the supplement first and make the maxim the conclusion. \"Since unpopularity is undesirable, it is better not to be educated.\" If not paradoxical but not obvious, add the reason concisely. Stesichorus said: \"Insolence is better avoided, lest the cicalas chirp on the ground.\"\n\nMaxims suit elderly men speaking on experienced subjects. For a young man to use them is unbecoming; for the inexperienced, silly. Country fellows strike out maxims readily.\n\nTo declare a thing universally true when it is not is appropriate for exciting horror or indignation. Even hackneyed maxims are useful; their commonness suggests truth. \"The War-God showeth no favour.\" \"Fool, who slayeth the father...\"\n\nSome proverbs are maxims (\"An Attic neighbour\"). Contradict common maxims if it raises your character or conveys strong emotion. \"It is not true that we ought to know ourselves; had this man known himself, he would never have commanded.\" \"We ought not to treat friends as future enemies, but enemies as future friends.\" Imply the moral purpose in the wording, or add a reason.\n\nMaxims help because unlearned hearers love to hear their own specific opinions expressed as universal truths. If a man has bad neighbors, he agrees that \"Nothing is more annoying than having neighbors.\" The orator must guess the audience's views and express them as general truths.\n\nMost importantly, maxims invest a speech with moral character. They declare moral principles; if the maxims are sound, the speaker appears good.\n\nWe now come to Enthymemes: how to look for them and the lines of argument they embody. The Enthymeme is a rhetorical syllogism. Unlike the dialectical syllogism, it should not reason too far back (causing obscurity) or include every step (wasting words). Uneducated speakers are more effective with crowds because they argue from common knowledge and draw obvious conclusions, whereas the educated lay down general principles. We must start from opinions accepted by our judges or their authorities, and base arguments on probabilities as well as certainties.\n\nWe must know the facts of our subject. To advise Athenians on war, we must know their strength, revenues, friends, and enemies. To eulogize them, we must know their deeds at Salamis or Marathon. Invectives rely on opposite facts. In court, we must know the facts of the case. Whether the subject is Achilles or justice, we must know the facts about him or it.\n\nProof requires facts bearing on the matter. We must select arguments suitable to the subject. We should think out arguments for special needs by keeping our eyes on actual facts. The more actual facts we have, the easier the proof; the more closely they bear on the subject, the less commonplace they seem. Commonplaces (like praising Achilles for being human) apply to many; special facts (slaying Hector) apply to him alone.\n\nThere are two kinds of enthymemes: demonstrative (proving a proposition) and refutative (disproving one). Demonstrative enthymemes join compatible propositions; refutative ones join incompatible propositions.\n\nWe have the lines of argument for special subjects (good, evil, justice, character). We must now consider the subject generally, distinguishing lines of proof from disproof, and valid enthymemes from sham ones. Then we will classify Objections and Refutations.\n\nHere are lines of argument for Enthymemes:\n\nOpposites. Observe whether the opposite of your subject has the opposite quality. If war causes our troubles, peace will put them right.\n\nModifications of the key-word. What applies to \"just\" may not apply to \"justly.\"\n\nCorrelative ideas. If it was right for A to command, it was right for B to obey. But check if it was right for A to command B specifically.\n\nA fortiori. If the gods are not omniscient, certainly men are not. If a quality is absent where most likely, it is absent where less likely. If Hector did well to slay Patroclus, Paris did well to slay Achilles.\n\nTime. If I had bargained for a statue before doing the deed, you would have granted it; will you refuse now that I have done it?\n\nTurning the tables. Apply the opponent's words to himself. \"Would you, Aristophon, betray the fleet?\" \"No.\" \"Then would I, Iphicrates?\" This works only if you are clearly less likely to commit the crime.\n\nDefinition. Define terms like \"supernatural\" or \"noble\" and reason from the definition. \"Goodness is true nobility.\"\n\nAmbiguity. Use the various senses of a word.\n\nLogical division. \"All men do wrong from motive A, B, or C. I did not act from A or B; you do not allege C.\"\n\nInduction. From the case of the woman of Peparethus, argue that women everywhere know the truth about their children.\n\nPrevious decisions. Appeal to decisions by the same judges, or by wise men, or by gods. \"Death is evil; the gods have so judged it, or they would die.\"\n\nParts of a subject. \"What temple has he profaned? What gods has he not honoured?\"\n\nConsequences. Use good and bad consequences to urge or discourage. Education leads to unpopularity (bad) and wisdom (good).\n\nDilemma (Divarication). If you speak right, men will hate you; if wrong, the gods will hate you. Reply: If right, gods love you; if wrong, men love you.\n\nContradicting common opinion. Men praise justice openly but prefer advantage secretly. Establish the view your opponent has not adopted.\n\nRational correspondence. If tall boys are men, short men are boys.\n\nIdentical antecedents. If \"giving earth and water\" and \"sharing the Common Peace\" both mean slavery, treat them as the same.\n\nInconsistency. Men change their minds. \"When exiles, we fought to return; now returned, we choose exile to avoid fighting.\"\n\nPossible motive. Assert a possible motive is the real one. God gives prosperity to make ruin more conspicuous.\n\nInducements and deterrents. Urge action if possible, easy, and useful; or if loss is outweighed by gain.\n\nIncredible truth. Argue that a thing is so incredible it must be true, for no one would invent it. \"Olive-cakes need oil.\"\n\nContradictions. Point out inconsistencies in dates, acts, or words. \"He says he loves you, yet conspired with the Thirty.\"\n\nExplaining false impressions. Show why facts are not as supposed. The woman embraced her son, not her lover.\n\nCause and effect. If the cause is present, the effect is present. If the record was erased, the Thirty must have trusted me.\n\nBetter course. If the accused could have taken a better course, he is innocent (since men choose the best). Fallacious, as the better course is often seen only later.\n\nInconsistency with past action. \"Do not mourn Leucothea if she is a goddess; do not sacrifice if she is a woman.\"\n\nPrevious mistakes. Medea made the mistake of sending her children away; she would have killed Jason, not them.\n\nNames. Draw meanings from names. \"Steel in heart as in name.\" \"Pentheus-a name foreshadowing grief.\"\n\nRefutative Enthymemes are more popular than Demonstrative ones because they are clearer. The best syllogisms are those whose conclusions we foresee or grasp immediately.\n\nSpurious Enthymemes look genuine but are not.\n\nWord-play. (a) Summary conclusion. Listing separate facts (he saved some, avenged others, freed Greeks) to create the impression of a fresh conclusion. (b) Homonyms. Arguing the mouse is noble because the Mysteries are \"most august\" (mysterion/mys). Or praising the dog because of the dog-star.\n\nPart and Whole. Asserting of the whole what is true of parts, or vice versa. \"Thrasybulus put down thirty tyrants\" (adding them up). Or: \"It is right to kill a husband-slayer; it is right for a son to avenge his father; therefore Orestes did right.\" The fallacy lies in omitting context (by whose hand?).\n\nIndignant Language. Painting a high-colored picture without proof. The prosecutor's passion implies guilt; the defendant's, innocence.\n\nSign (Single Instance). \"Lovers are useful to countries, for Harmodius and Aristogeiton overthrew the tyrant.\" \"Dionysius is a thief because he is vicious.\" (Invalid: not all vicious men are thieves).\n\nAccidental as Essential. \"The mice came to the rescue because they gnawed the bowstrings.\" (They gnawed because hungry). \"Achilles was angered because he was not invited.\" (He was angered by the insult, not the missed dinner).\n\nConsequence. \"Paris had a lofty soul because he lived on Ida.\" (Lofty people do, but so do others). \"He is a rake because he dresses fashionably.\" (Rakes do, but not all fashionable men are rakes).\n\nPost hoc ergo propter hoc. \"Demosthenes' policy caused the mischief, for the war happened after it.\"\n\nOmitting Time and Circumstance. \"Paris was justified because Helen's father gave her choice.\" (Choice was for her first marriage only). \"Striking a free man is outrage.\" (Only if unprovoked).\n\nAbsolute vs. Particular. Confusing particular probability with absolute probability.\n\nWe refute arguments by counter-syllogism or objection.\n\nCounter-syllogisms are built from ordinary opinions, which often contradict each other.\n\nObjections are raised in four ways:\n\nEnthymemes are based on Probabilities, Examples, Infallible Signs, or Ordinary Signs.\n\nProbabilities. These argue from what is usually true. They can always be refuted by showing they are not inevitably true. This gives the defense an advantage. However, judges should decide on likelihood, not just certainty. The defendant should show the charge is not likely true, by stating what is more usually true.\n\nFallible Signs. These can be refuted even if the facts are correct, for they do not form a valid logical proof.\n\nExamples. Refuted like probabilities. A single negative instance refutes inevitability. If the opponent has more examples, argue that the present case is unlike them.\n\nInfallible Signs. If the fact is admitted, these cannot be refuted.\n\nAmplification and Depreciation are not elements of an enthymeme (lines of argument), but kinds of enthymeme used to show greatness or smallness.\n\nRefutative Enthymemes are not a different species from Constructive ones. Refutation involves proving the opposite or raising an objection. Proving the opposite uses the same means as construction. An objection is not an enthymeme but a statement showing the opponent reasoned incorrectly or falsely.\n\nWe have now discussed the thought-element (Examples, Maxims, Enthymemes). We must next discuss Style and Arrangement.\n\nA speech requires three studies: persuasion, style, and arrangement. We have covered persuasion (emotions, character, proof) and enthymemes.\n\nNow we discuss style. It is not enough to know what to say; we must say it rightly.\n\nDelivery (voice management, volume, pitch, rhythm) affects success but has been neglected. It is essential for persuasion because of the hearer's defects; ideally, facts alone should suffice. Delivery is acting; it can be taught.\n\nPoets first developed style. Prose initially copied poetry (Gorgias), but they are distinct. Even tragedy has dropped high-flown language for the iambic meter, which resembles speech. We should not imitate a poetic manner that poets themselves have dropped.\n\nGood style must be clear and appropriate. If speech is not clear, it fails. It must be neither mean nor unduly elevated. Clearness comes from using current, ordinary words. Distinction comes from strange words, metaphors, and lengthened forms, as in poetry. But in prose, these must be used sparingly; the subject matter is less exalted.\n\nA writer must disguise his art and seem natural. Naturalness persuades; artificiality makes people suspicious. We can hide our art by selecting words from ordinary speech, as Euripides did.\n\nMetaphor is the prose writer's chief resource, giving clearness, charm, and distinction. Metaphors must be fitting. If you wish to compliment, take the metaphor from something better; if to disparage, from something worse. Iphicrates called Callias a \"mendicant priest\"; Callias called himself a \"torch-bearer.\" Pirates call themselves \"purveyors.\"\n\nMetaphors must sound good. \"Calliope's screech\" is bad because \"screech\" is discordant. Metaphors should come from kindred things. A cup is the \"shield of Dionysus\"; a shield, the \"cup of Ares.\"\n\nWords are not interchangeable; some are fairer or fouler than others. \"Rosy-fingered morn\" is better than \"red-fingered.\" Epithets can also be good or bad: \"mother-slayer\" vs. \"father's avenger.\" Diminutives (like \"goldlet\") make things seem less important.\n\nBad taste in language takes four forms:\n\nCompounds suit dithyrambs; strange words, epics; metaphors, iambics (and prose).\n\nThe Simile is a metaphor with a slight difference. \"He leapt as a lion\" is a simile; \"the lion leapt\" is a metaphor. Similes are useful in prose but less often than in verse. They are employed like metaphors.\n\nAll these can be expressed as similes or metaphors. Similes without the explanation are metaphors.\n\nThe foundation of good style is correctness.\n\nComposition should be easy to read and deliver. Avoid many connectives or hard punctuation (like Heracleitus, where it is unclear if \"always\" goes with what precedes or follows). Avoid solecisms like annexing a verb to two terms that don't fit both (\"perceive\" fits sound and color; \"see\" does not). Avoid parenthesis that interrupts the sense.\n\nSuggestions for impressiveness:\n\nStyle should be appropriate to the subject, emotion, and character. Do not speak casually of weighty matters or solemnly of trivial ones. Do not add ornamental epithets to commonplace nouns (\"O queenly fig-tree\").\n\nExpress emotion: anger for outrage, disgust for impiety. Apt language makes people believe the story; they think you are truthful because you sound like others do when such things happen. An emotional speaker makes the audience feel with him.\n\nExpress character. A rustic and an educated man speak differently. Use the words appropriate to the speaker's age, sex, and nationality.\n\nCounteract exaggeration by criticizing yourself. Do not make everything correspond exactly (voice, face, words), or artifice appears. If words are harsh, do not make voice and face harsh too.\n\nCompound words and epithets suit emotional speeches. We forgive an angry man for calling a wrong \"heaven-high.\" This language fits poetry and deep emotion.\n\nProse should be rhythmical but not metrical. Meter makes the hearer suspicious of artifice. But language without rhythm is unlimited and vague; number limits all things.\n\nThe heroic rhythm is dignified but not conversational. The iambic is conversational but lacks dignity. The trochee is too like dancing. The paean (ratio 3:2) is best. It is less obtrusive.\n\nUse one kind of paean for the beginning (long syllable followed by three short) and the opposite for the end (three short followed by a long). The long syllable at the end gives a sense of closure.\n\nProse must be either free-running (like Herodotus) or periodic.\n\nFree-running style has no natural stops, ending only when the subject ends. It is unsatisfying because indefinite; we like to see the goal.\n\nPeriodic style is divided into periods. A period is a portion of speech with a beginning and end, easily grasped. It is satisfying and easy to follow and remember (because numbered).\n\nPeriods should not break off abruptly. They may be simple (one member) or divided (several members). Members should be neither curt nor long.\n\nPeriodic style is either simply divided or antithetical. Antithesis puts opposites together (\"They aided both those who stayed and those who went\"). This is satisfying because the contrast is clear and logical.\n\nParisosis makes members equal in length. Paromoeosis makes them sound alike at the beginning or end (rhyme, alliteration).\n\nLively and taking sayings come from natural talent or practice, but we can analyze them.\n\nWe like learning easily. Strange words puzzle; ordinary words convey old news. Metaphor brings fresh knowledge. \"Old age is a withered stalk\" teaches us through the common notion of bloom lost. Similes do the same but are less attractive because longer and less direct.\n\nLively speech makes us seize a new idea promptly. We dislike the obvious and the puzzling. We like the antithetical form (\"judging peace a war\") and the metaphorical. Metaphors must not be far-fetched or obvious. They should set the scene before our eyes (Actuality).\n\nThe proportional metaphor is best.\n\nGraphic metaphors imply activity or visibility. \"God kindled reason as a lamp.\" \"Postponing wars, not ending them.\"\n\nMaking hearers \"see things\" means representing them in activity. \"With his vigour in full bloom\" suggests activity; \"four-square\" does not. Homer constantly gives metaphorical life to lifeless things: \"The arrow flew,\" \"The spear drove.\" He represents everything as moving and living.\n\nDraw metaphors from related but not obvious things. Archytas called an arbitrator and an altar the same (both are refuges). An anchor and a hook are the same (one secures from below, one from above).\n\nSurprise conveys liveliness. When words mean something different from what they say, or when a new idea contradicts the old, the hearer is impressed. \"The cicalas will chirp on the ground.\" \"His feet were shod with his—chilblains\" (surprise ending).\n\nJokes often depend on double meanings or slight changes in letters. \"You Thracian slavey\" (Thratt' ei su) sounds like \"You harpplayer\" (Thratteis su). \"The empire (arche) of the sea was not the beginning (arche) of troubles.\"\n\nThe best sayings are brief and antithetical. \"Death is most fit before you do deeds that would make death fit for you.\" This impresses the new idea firmly and quickly.\n\nEach kind of rhetoric has its own style. Written prose differs from spoken; political from forensic.\n\nWritten style is more finished. Spoken style admits dramatic delivery. Professional speeches often sound thin in contests, while orators' speeches look amateurish when read. This is because the latter suit the tussle; unconnected words and repetitions, condemned in writing, work dramatically in speech (if varied in tone).\n\nPolitical oratory is like scene-painting: the bigger the crowd, the more distant the view, and exactness is unnecessary. Forensic oratory requires more exactness, especially before a single judge. A single judge is easily persuaded; he sees the point quickly.\n\nCeremonial oratory is most literary, being meant for reading; forensic is second.\n\nTo be clear, do not be chatty or emotional if you want to be exact. If you want to be dramatic, do not be exact.\n\nA speech has two essential parts: Statement and Argument. You state your case and prove it. It is impossible to state without proving, or prove without stating.\n\nThe current division is absurd. \"Narration\" belongs properly to forensic speech. Introduction, comparison, and recapitulation are not always needed.\n\nThe necessary parts are Statement and Argument. At most, a speech has Introduction, Statement, Argument, and Epilogue. Refutation and Comparison are parts of the Argument. Inventing new names like \"post-narration\" (Theodorus) is pointless unless they indicate real species.\n\nThe Introduction begins the speech, like a prologue or prelude.\n\nIn speeches of display, introductions resemble musical preludes—brilliant passages fitted to the opening. The writer begins with what takes his fancy (praise, censure, advice, or appeal).\n\nForensic introductions resemble dramatic prologues: they preview the theme. \"Sing, O goddess, of the Wrath.\" This is the essential function: to show the aim. If the subject is short and plain, no introduction is needed.\n\nOther introductions are remedial, concerned with the speaker, hearer, subject, or opponent. The defendant removes prejudice at the start; the prosecutor excites it at the close. The defendant must clear obstacles to get a hearing; the prosecutor must make the memory stick.\n\nAppeals to the hearer aim at goodwill, resentment, attention, or distraction. Attention is highest at the beginning, so calls for it are often ridiculous there; use them where interest flags (\"Slip in a bit of the fifty-drachma lecture\").\n\nPolitical introductions are rare because the subject is known. They are used to handle prejudice or magnify/minimize importance.\n\nTo create prejudice, select the worse motive. To remove it, put the better construction on it.\n\nNarration in ceremonial oratory is intermittent. You must survey the actions, but proof is rarely needed. Do not make the narrative continuous; apply the facts. Narrate deeds only if they are not well-known.\n\nAbsurdly, some say narration should be rapid. It should be right—neither long nor curt, but sufficient to make facts plain and credible.\n\nNarrate anything creditable to yourself or discreditable to your adversary (\"He answered he would find other children\"). The defendant narrating should be brief, maintaining the thing did not happen, or was not wrong. Speak of past events as past, unless exciting pity or indignation.\n\nNarration should depict character by indicating moral purpose. Mathematical discourses show no character (no purpose); Socratic dialogues do. Describe manifestations of character (\"He walked as he talked\").\n\nDo not seem inspired by intelligence (which seeks the useful) but by purpose (which seeks the noble). If a detail is incredible, add the cause (Antigone caring more for her brother than husband). If you have no cause, say so.\n\nUse emotions. Relate familiar manifestations (\"He went away scowling\"). Bring yourself on stage in the right character from the start.\n\nPolitical oratory has little narration (of the future), unless recalling the past to help plans or attack character. If a statement is hard to believe, guarantee its truth and explain.\n\nArguments attempt demonstrative proofs. The dispute falls under four heads:\n\nOnly in the first case is one party necessarily a rogue (ignorance is no plea).\n\nIn ceremonial speeches, argue that the deed was noble and useful. The facts are usually taken on trust; prove them only if incredible.\n\nIn political speeches, maintain the proposal is impracticable, unjust, useless, or unimportant. Attack falsehoods in irrelevant matters to discredit the rest. Use examples (past events) rather than enthymemes (which suit forensic oratory better, dealing with non-contingent past facts). Do not use enthymemes incessantly; intersperse them. Do not use them when rousing emotion (it kills the feeling) or depicting character (demonstration shows no moral purpose). Use maxims for character.\n\nIf you have no enthymemes, fall back on moral discourse; it suits a good man better than subtle reasoning. Refutative enthymemes are more popular than demonstrative.\n\nReply to the Opponent is part of the Argument. If speaking first, put your arguments first, then refute. If the other side has strong arguments, demolish them first (like Callistratus). If speaking later, attack the opponent's speech first to clear the ground.\n\nFor moral character, put invidious remarks into a third person's mouth (as Isocrates and Sophocles do). Restate enthymemes as maxims.\n\nUse Interrogation when the opponent's answer to one question makes the next one fatal. Pericles asked Lampon: \"No uninitiated person can be told the rites?\" \"No.\" \"Do you know them?\" \"Yes.\" \"How, being uninitiated?\"\n\nUse it when one premise is obvious and the other must be admitted. Do not ask the obvious one; state the conclusion. Socrates asked Meletus: \"Are not supernatural beings children of gods?\" \"Yes.\" \"Then does anyone believe in children of gods but not gods?\"\n\nDo not question if the opponent has a good answer (\"True, but...\"). Do not ask a series of questions; the audience cannot follow.\n\nReply to ambiguous questions by distinguishing. Reply to contradictions by explaining immediately.\n\nKill earnestness with jesting, and jesting with earnestness (Gorgias). Irony befits a gentleman (amusing himself); buffoonery befits a buffoon (amusing others).\n\nEnd with a disconnected style to mark the close: \"I have done. You have heard me. The facts are before you. I ask for your judgement.\"",

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) — serving out her final days before stepping down from Congress — ripped President Donald Trump’s decision to strike Venezuela.\n\nIn a post to X on Saturday, Greene lashed out at the administration justifying the move on the grounds that they were looking to combat narco-terrorism.\n\n“I’ve served on the Homeland Security Committee for the past three years,” Greene wrote. “I’m 100% for strong safe secure borders and stopping narco terrorists and cartels from trafficking deadly drugs and human trafficking into America. Fentanyl is responsible for over 70% of U.S. drug overdose deaths and fentanyl comes from Mexican cartels made with chemical precursors from China and trafficked across the U.S. Mexico border. Mexican cartels are primarily and overwhelmingly responsible for killing Americans with deadly drugs. If U.S. military action and regime change in Venezuela was really about saving American lives from deadly drugs then why hasn’t the Trump admin taken action against Mexican cartels? And if prosecuting narco terrorists is a high priority then why did President Trump pardon the former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez who was convicted and sentenced for 45 years for trafficking hundreds of tons of cocaine into America? Ironically cocaine is the same drug that Venezuela primarily traffics into the U.S.”\n\nThe next obvious observation is that by removing Maduro this is a clear move for control over Venezuelan oil supplies that will ensure stability for the next obvious regime change war in Iran.\n\nAnd of course why is it ok for America to militarily invade, bomb, and arrest a foreign leader but Russia is evil for invading Ukraine and China is bad for aggression against Taiwan? Is it only ok if we do it? (I’m not endorsing Russia or China)\n\nThe congresswoman, in a subsequent post went on to blast the idea of ousting the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro, through a military action.\n\n“Regime change, funding foreign wars, and American’s (sic) tax dollars being consistently funneled to foreign causes, foreigners both home and abroad, and foreign governments while Americans are consistently facing increasing cost of living, housing, healthcare, and learn about scams and fraud of their tax dollars is what has most Americans enraged,” Greene wrote. “Especially the younger generations. Boomers and half of Gen X will cheer on neocon wars and talking points, but the other half of Gen X and majority on down see through it and hate it. Americans (sic) disgust with our own government’s never ending military aggression and support of foreign wars is justified because we are forced to pay for it and both parties, Republicans and Democrats, always keep the Washington military machine funded and going.”\n\nGreene added, “This is what many in MAGA thought they voted to end. Boy were we wrong.”\n\nAnd in a subsequent post following Trump’s announcement that the U.S. will “run” Venezuela, Greene expressed her disgust with a facepalm emoji.\n\nhttps://x.com/mtgreenee/status/2007505789108543761?s=20\n\nThe post Marjorie Taylor Greene Rips Trump’s Strike on Venezuela: ‘MAGA Thought They Voted to End’ This — ‘Boy Were We Wrong’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "On November 2, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles told Vanity Fair that land strikes in Venezuela would require the approval of Congress. She said that if Trump “were to authorize some activity on land, then it’s war, then (we’d need) Congress.”",
    "fullText": "On November 2, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles told Vanity Fair that land strikes in Venezuela would require the approval of Congress. She said that if Trump “were to authorize some activity on land, then it’s war, then (we’d need) Congress.”\n\nDays later, Trump administration officials privately told members of Congress much the same thing – that they lacked the legal justification to support attacks against any land targets in Venezuela.\n\nJust two months later, though, the Trump administration has done what it previously indicated it couldn’t.\n\nIt launched what Trump called a “large scale strike against Venezuela” and captured its president, Nicolás Maduro, to face charges. And it launched this regime change effort without the approval of Congress.\n\n(Trump in November claimed he didn’t need congressional authorization for land action, but it clearly wasn’t the consensus view in the administration.)\n\nIt appears the mission is, for now, limited to removing Maduro. But as Trump noted, it did involve striking inside the country – the same circumstance some in the administration previously indicated required authorization that it didn’t have. CNN reported back in early November that the administration was seeking a new legal opinion from the Justice Department for such strikes.\n\nAnd Trump in a news conference Saturday spoke repeatedly about not just arresting Maduro, but also running Venezuela and taking over its oil – comments that could certainly be understood to suggest this was about more than arresting Maduro.\n\nLegally dubious strikes inside another country – even ones narrowly tailored at removing a foreign leaders – are hardly unheard of in recent American history. But even in that context, this one is remarkable.\n\nThat’s because the Trump administration has taken remarkably little care to offer a consistent set of justifications or a legal framework for the attack. And it doesn’t even appear to have notified Congress ahead of time, which is generally the bare minimum in such circumstances.\n\nA full explanation of the claimed justification has yet to be issued, but the early signs are characteristically confusing.\n\nRepublican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah said shortly after the strikes that Secretary of State Marco Rubio told him the attack was needed to, in Lee’s words, “protect and defend those executing the arrest warrant” against Maduro.\n\n“This action likely falls within the president’s inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution to protect U.S. personnel from an actual or imminent attack,” said Lee, a frequent critic of unauthorized foreign military action.\n\nHours later, Vice President JD Vance echoed that line.\n\n“And PSA for everyone saying this was ‘illegal’: Maduro has multiple indictments in the United States for narcoterrorism,” Vance said on X. “You don’t get to avoid justice for drug trafficking in the United States because you live in a palace in Caracas.”\n\nAt a later news conference, Rubio echoed the line that the military had been supporting “a law enforcement function.”\n\nBut there are many people living in other countries that are under indictment in the United States; it is not the US government’s usual course to launch strikes on foreign countries to bring them to justice.\n\nThe administration also hadn’t previously indicated that military force could be legally used for this reason.\n\nInitially, Trump threatened land strikes inside Venezuela to target drug traffickers – this despite Venezuela being an apparently somewhat small player in the drug-trafficking game.\n\nLater, the administration suggested strikes might be needed because Venezuela sent bad people into the United States.\n\nAnd then, after initially downplaying the role of oil in the US pressure campaign against Venezuela and Maduro, Trump said he aimed to reclaim “the oil, land, and other assets that they previously stole from us.”\n\nThe signals were confusing enough that even the hawkish Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina in mid-December indicated the administration lacked “clarity” in its messaging.\n\n“I want clarity right here,” Graham said. “President Trump is saying his days are numbered. That seems to me that he’s gotta go. If it’s the goal of taking him out because he’s a threat to our country, then say it. And what happens next? Don’t you think most people want to know that?”\n\nDespite the focus on the law enforcement operation on Saturday, Trump at the news conference said the United States would now participate in running Venezuela, at least temporarily. And he repeatedly spoke about its oil.\n\n“We’re going to rebuild the oil infrastructure,” Trump said, adding at another point: “We’re going to run the country right.”\n\nAnd even if the administration had offered a more consistent justification, that doesn’t mean it would be an appropriate one.\n\nThe most recent major example of using the US military for regime change is, of course, the war in Iraq. That war was authorized by Congress in 2002. The broader war on terror was authorized by Congress in 2001, after the 9/11 attacks.\n\nSince then, administrations have sought to justify several military actions in the Middle East using those authorizations – sometimes dubiously. But Venezuela is in an entirely different theater.\n\nWhile many have compared the effort in Venezuela to Iraq, the better comparison – and one the administration apparently intends to make – is Panama in 1989.\n\nLike in Venezuela, Panama’s leader at the time, Manuel Noriega, was under US indictment, including for drug-trafficking. And like in Venezuela, the operation was less a large-scale war than a narrowly tailored effort to remove the leader from power.\n\nThe Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel in 1980 had concluded that the FBI didn’t have the authority to apprehend and abduct a foreign national to face justice. But George H.W. Bush administration’s OLC quietly reversed that in the summer of 1989.\n\nA memo written by William P. Barr, who would later become attorney general in that Bush administration and Trump’s first administration, said a president had “inherent constitutional authority” to order the FBI to take people into custody in foreign countries, even if it violated international law to do so.\n\nThat memo was soon used to justify the operation to remove Noriega. (As it happens, Noriega was captured the same day Maduro was: January 3,1990.)\n\nBut that memo remains controversial to this day. It’s also an extraordinarily broad grant of authority, potentially allowing US military force anywhere\n\nAnd the situation in Venezuela could differ in that it’s a larger country that could prove tougher to control with its leader in foreign custody. It also has significant oil wealth, meaning other countries could take an interest in what happens there next. (China has called the attack a “blatant use of force against a sovereign state.”)\n\nIn both the news conference and an interview with Fox News on Saturday morning, Trump invoked the possibility of further military option, reinforcing that this could be about more than just arresting Maduro.\n\nThat also means the questions about Trump’s legal authorities could again be tested – just as he’s already tested them with his legally dubious strikes on alleged drug boats and other actions in the region.\n\nWhat’s clear is that Trump is seeking to yet again test the limits of his authority as president – and Americans’ tolerance for it. But this time he’s doing it on one of the biggest stages yet. And the story of his stretching of the law certainly isn’t over.",

    "title": "What to Eat When You Haven’t Pooped in Days, According to Dietitians",
    "description": "When you’re overdue for a BM, these foods and drinks can get things going!",
    "fullText": "Reviewed by Dietitian Karen Ansel, M.S., RDN\n\nConstipation is surprisingly common, affecting as many as 20% of us regularly.\n\nDietitians say prunes, kiwi and flaxseed can help. So can drinking coffee, warm water or kefir.\n\nHydrating, chewing food thoroughly and moving regularly may also ease constipation.\n\nAfter a few days without a satisfying trip to the bathroom, anyone would be desperate to get things moving. As uncomfortable as constipation may be, you’re hardly alone. Up to 20% of U.S. adults experience constipation on a regular basis.\n\nAs vexing as that may be, there are things you can do to get things going again. In fact, relief may be as close as your kitchen. According to dietitians specializing in digestive health, certain foods and drinks can do wonders for easing constipation–even when you haven’t gone in days.\n\nHere are their top choices to provide the relief you need, stat.\n\n“It turns out that the old adage that prunes help with constipation is true!” says Kaytee Hadley, M.S., RDN, IFMCP. Research has found that prunes can help reduce hard, lumpy stools and promote more regular bowel movements in people with chronic constipation. Ditto for prune juice.\n\nWhat makes them so effective? There are several mechanisms, says Hadley. For starters, prunes provide fiber (four prunes contain nearly 3 grams). That fiber draws water into the stool to keep it soft and moving easily.  Prunes also contain sorbitol, a natural sugar that also pulls water into the colon, working as a natural laxative to help you go, says Hadley.\n\nIf you’re wondering how many prunes you should eat for relief, Kinga Portik-Gumbs, RDN, recommends about four prunes per day. That said, these sorbitol-rich fruits aren’t for everyone. “Because of the high sorbitol and fructan content, two types of FODMAPs, they may not be ideal for people who are sensitive to these FODMAP foods,” says Portik-Gumbs.\n\nSeveral recent studies show that kiwifruits are highly effective at relieving constipation.,, One reason is their fiber. Two kiwis provide roughly 6 grams of fiber, giving you more than 20% of the Daily Value in one easy serving. And they have another advantage, says Samina Qureshi, RDN, LD. “Unlike prunes, which are high in sorbitol, kiwifruit is low-FODMAP and often much better tolerated by people who struggle with bloating or IBS,” she explains.\n\nStudies show that eating two kiwifruits per day is the sweet spot. “MRI studies show that eating two kiwifruits daily increases both water and volume in the intestines, supporting regularity and comfort,” says Portik-Gumbs. In fact, research has found that eating two kiwis is more effective for easing chronic constipation than the laxative psyllium.\n\n“Flaxseed has been shown to increase how often you poop and improve stool form,” says Qureshi. One study found that when people with functional constipation consumed 50 grams of flaxseed flour daily for four weeks, they went from having just two weekly bowel movements to seven! And another study found that folks with chronic constipation who consumed 50 grams of ground flaxseed powder daily for one month pooped more frequently and experienced less bloating.\n\nThese powerful little seeds work in several ways to get things moving. “Ground flaxseeds absorb water and form a gel-like texture in the gut that adds bulk, improves stool consistency and helps move waste along,” says Hadley. They may also foster the growth of beneficial gut bacteria linked to less constipation.\n\nPlus, they couldn’t be easier to add to your day. “It’s a simple addition that can easily be added to smoothies, yogurt bowls or baked goods that can have a big impact!” says Qureshi.\n\nIf you’re a coffee lover, you’ll be thrilled to know that a warm cup of coffee may be just what you need to kick your digestive system into gear. And it's not just about caffeine, either. “Both regular and decaf coffee contain several different compounds that stimulate the muscles of the colon, which is why many people feel the urge to go shortly after drinking it,” says Hadley. In as little as four minutes after drinking coffee, the muscles in your colon start contracting, giving you the urge to go.\n\nHowever, if you really want to get the ball rolling, have your coffee with breakfast. Morning is when your body’s digestive rhythms are most likely to be stimulated by food, so it’s the perfect time to nudge your gut, says Qureshi.\n\nIf coffee isn’t your thing, experts recommend starting your day with a cup of warm water. “Consuming warm water first thing in the morning can help stimulate the colon and increase the chances of a successful bowel movement,” says Portik-Gumbs.\n\n“What do yogurt, kefir, kombucha, kimchi and sauerkraut all have in common? These fermented foods and drinks provide beneficial bacteria that can help with constipation while supporting the microbiome,” says Hadley. While all of these are worth weaving into your rotation, kefir has research-backed benefits for constipation relief. For instance, one study found that people who drank kefir daily for eight weeks experienced less constipation, abdominal pain and bloating.  A recent research review study confirms these findings, concluding that—in addition to easing constipation, abdominal pain and bloating—consuming fermented dairy products, like kefir, can also reduce gassiness.\n\nConsuming these foods and drinks is a great start, but it’s not the only strategy that can spell relief. Next time you need some help pooping, give these expert-backed strategies a try.\n\nTry Some Light Exercise. “Gentle movement, like walking after eating, can help stimulate digestion and encourage bowel movements,” says Portik-Gumbs. Go for a stroll or do some gentle stretching after breakfast.\n\nEat Slowly. “Take your time eating and chew foods thoroughly until they’re almost pureed,” advises Portik-Gumbs. “This gives your digestive system a kick start and helps with bowel-movement production.”\n\nHydrate. “Staying well-hydrated keeps stool soft and easier to pass, which is especially important after several days of constipation when it gets hard and dry,” says Hadley. If you’re increasing your fiber intake, it’s especially important to drink more water to help fiber move through your body smoothly.\n\nMassage Your Belly. “A gentle clockwise belly massage can support your body’s natural ability to have a bowel movement,” says Qureshi.\n\nGoing for days without pooping feels like, well, poop. But certain foods and drinks can help. “Choosing the right foods and drinks can make all the difference in how quickly things start moving again,” says Portik-Gumbs. Fiber-rich foods and fluids are good general go-tos. But prunes, kiwifruit, ground flaxseed, coffee, warm water and kefir are especially great for prompting a poop. In addition to weaving these foods into your routine, be sure to hydrate well, chew your food thoroughly and work some gentle movement into your day. If all else fails, try a clockwise belly massage after eating. It just might help!",

Is this a sign of fraud or something that you should be worried about?\n\nLet's take a look at a hypothetical example. Say that John contributes $200 to his 401(k) account every pay period. The money is taken out of his check and invested automatically in a target date fund based on his chosen retirement date.\n\nBut one day, John logs into his account and sees that contributions were made and the fund purchased, and then sees the shares of the fund sold a few days later and the money withdrawn — but the money he contributed isn't put back into his account.\n\nJohn is worried that his employer isn’t telling him anything about this.

When they do, employers must deposit contributions from worker paychecks in a timely manner — within no more than 15 business days into the month following the payday. However, if they can reasonably deposit funds sooner, they must.\n\nEmployers are not allowed to misuse 401(k) funds, and companies must take steps to protect your money, including from cyberattacks.

    "fullText": "A short video. A few words. And suddenly, the internet is on fire.\n\nA Somali TikToker is facing intense backlash after commenting what many interpreted as a threat against Elon Musk. The remark spread fast, pulled Musk into the conversation, and triggered a wave of reactions that raised serious questions about online speech and real-world consequences.\n\nIn the now-viral clip, the TikToker appeared dismissive when Musk’s name came up. Her response stopped people cold.\n\n“I wouldn’t worry too much about him,” she said. “He about to die.”\n\nThe statement didn’t include context, jokes, or qualifiers. Viewers immediately flagged it as disturbing, especially given Musk’s global profile and the climate around public figures and security concerns. The clip moved across X, TikTok, and Reddit within hours.\n\nBOOM! Elon Musk FIRES BACK at the Somali woman threatening his life\n\nWhen fraud is exposed – it’s always the fraudsters who yell and complain the loudest.\n\nTheir THEFT will come to an end. pic.twitter.com/K0sfl3DFl1\n\n— Eric Daugherty (@EricLDaugh) January 2, 2026\n\nElon Musk didn’t ignore it. Instead, he responded directly on X with a blunt message that escalated the situation instantly. “Then it is war.”\n\nThe response fueled speculation. Some saw it as sarcasm. Others read it as a warning. Either way, it ensured the exchange wouldn’t fade quietly.\n\nOnce Musk replied, the clip went from niche content to headline material.\n\nAs the clip circulated, comment sections exploded. Many users expressed shock at how casually the statement was delivered. Others went further, predicting severe consequences for the TikToker.\n\n“She’s about to spend some years behind bars,” one comment read. Another user wrote, “She about to be ‘mysteriously’ missing. I don’t think anyone will care.”\n\nThose comments sparked a second wave of criticism, with users arguing that the backlash itself was becoming dangerous.\n\nSeveral legal-minded users pointed out why the comment raised alarms. Saying that a healthy, relatively young person will die soon can be interpreted as more than opinion.\n\n“When you say that a person who is healthy and not old will die ‘naturally’ soon, this looks like a threat,” one widely shared post argued.\n\nIn many countries, language that implies harm toward a specific individual can trigger investigation, even without explicit details.\n\nThat distinction matters more when the subject is a high-profile figure.\n\nThe situation reopened a familiar debate. Where does free expression end, and where does accountability begin?\n\nSome defended the TikToker, claiming the statement was careless but not criminal. Others argued that public figures face constant danger and that language like this cannot be brushed aside.\n\nPlatforms also came under scrutiny for how quickly content spreads before moderation steps in. Once again, the internet moved faster than clarity.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Musk has become the center of an online firestorm triggered by a single sentence. His presence alone tends to magnify conflicts.\n\nOne comment becomes a movement. One reply becomes a signal. And millions rush to interpret intent. That dynamic keeps repeating, and each time the stakes feel higher.\n\nJUST IN: Somali woman Fardowsa Muhumed is FRANTIC after threatening Elon Musk’s life, to which Elon replied, “then IT IS WAR”\n\nShe’s retracting her threat, and says “[I am] truly in fear for my future!”\n\nCowards.pic.twitter.com/aG1pRqYplt https://t.co/mMkGcIMu7u\n\n— Eric Daugherty (@EricLDaugh) January 2, 2026\n\nIn a video released a few hours ago, the Somali woman has apologized for her comments and claimed the video was taken out of context.\n\n“Let me make myself clear, I never intended or aimed to threaten the life of Elon Musk. I am not a person who carries around hate; the media has taken my words out of context, and it’s been deeply hurtful to watch how that’s turned into me being dehumanized and painted as a villain.",

    "fullText": "In Marin County, flooding left motorists stranded and kayakers paddling Saturday in areas where bicyclists usually pedaled. In San Francisco, storm surge drenched onlookers on the Embarcadero and at Crissy Field.\n\nElsewhere, storm surge forced other road closures in Alameda County and as far as Pacifica and Half Moon Bay.\n\nCalifornia flood map:See real-time updates\n\nMore reading: Heavy snow blankets Sierra, beckoning skiers and challenging drivers\n\nJon Borges surveyed the flooded intersection by the Grand Gasoline gas station just off 101 at De Silva Island Drive in Mill Valley, and his friend's stranded Toyota pickup.\n\n\"I was not expecting that at all,\" he said, of the impacts of the weekend's king tides, which flooded many low-lying areas in Mill Valley, as well as in San Francisco's Embarcadero and elsewhere around the Bay Area.\n\nThe trifecta of a super moon, an incoming storm system's strong winds and heavy rains resulted in a high tide Saturday morning 2.5 feet higher than normal - the highest king tide since Feb. 6, 1998, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Roger Gass. Flooding was reported across the Bay Area in Marin County, Sonoma County, Alameda County, San Mateo County and San Francisco.\n\nThe tide peaked just after 10:30 a.m. Saturday, though its took hours for floodwaters to recede. San Francisco's record high tide was 2.8 feet on Jan. 27, 1998.\n\nThe high tides prompted a coastal flood advisory in effect through 2 p.m. Sunday for much of the Bay Area and Central Coast. The powerful king tides and gusty winds sent seawater into streets, parks and other low-lying areas.  Floodwaters 2 feet deep closed parts of Interstate 80 just west of the metering lights on Oakland's side of the Bay Bridge and forced closure of other roads in Corte Madera, plus numerous roads in Sonoma County.\n\nStorm surge sent sent high waves over coastal jetties in Pacifica and Half Moon Bay, and over the walkways at Pier 14 in San Francisco's Embarcadero, drenching onlookers.\n\nFlash floods also disrupted traffic in Southern California. Southbound Highway 101 in Gaviota (Santa Barbara County) was closed Saturday morning due to a mudslide and flooding covering all lanes.\n\nMill Valley was especially hard hit, with flooding stranding motorists and forcing the closure of intersections.\n\nBorges, 28, had received a call at about 10:30 a.m., as the king tide was peaking.\n\nHis friend tried to drive his Toyota pickup through the flooded intersection and gotten trapped until local firefighters helped extricate him.\n\nBorges lives on a houseboat in Sausalito and is used to king tides, he said, but neither he nor his friend had realized how bad the flooding would be at the intersection by the gas station.\n\n\"We're just waiting for the water to go down enough to get a tow truck,\" he said.\n\nAt Camino Alto and Miller Avenue, Mill Valley Department of Public Works employees blocked a flooded intersection.\n\n\"It's the first time I've ever seen it this nasty,\" said Mark Bartel, who started working for the department six months earlier.\n\nThe department had to close other roads for minor flooding two months earlier, but \"it was nothing like this,\" he said as he waved motorists into the parking lot of the adjoining Safeway.\n\nA few yards down the way, Jen Bennett, 53, and Marianne Kabir, 56, were walking to pick up their sons from basketball practice.\n\n\"You can't even get to the high school,\" Bennett said.\n\nEarlier in the day, she'd tried to go for a run, only to find her usual trails underwater.\n\nKabir looked on the bright side. All the flooding had brought out a bevy of birds.\n\n\"It's really gorgeous,\" she said.\n\nAt Equator Coffee, farther down Almonte Boulevard, baristas fielded calls from customers wondering whether they could get to the shop. Julia Pfahl, 36, was picking up a morning coffee and chatting with baristas. She'd had to leave home much earlier than usual to get to work at Proof Lab Surf Shop. When she'd arrived at work, she'd found the shop under 4 inches of water.\n\n\"It's the worst I've ever seen it,\" she said, chuckling. \"Everyone is in a panic, no one knows how to drive in it - I saw a car by the Holiday Inn (on nearby Shoreline Highway) with water up to its windows. Did you really think you could drive through that?\"\n\nMeteorologists said another period of minor coastal flooding was expected late Sunday morning, though it will not be as severe as Saturday's water levels.\n\nTide levels will be about half a foot lower than Saturday's flooding, meteorologists said. By Monday, the coastal flood advisories are expected to drop off.\n\nThis article originally published at ‘Worst I've ever seen it': Bay Area flooding closes roads, strands motorists.",

    "fullText": "NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Kenyans are mourning the death of a beloved “super tusker” elephant whose long life in the wild came to symbolize the country's increasingly successful efforts to protect the mammals from ivory poachers.\n\nThe bull elephant who died on Saturday was named Craig. He lived in Amboseli National Park, a protected area in southern Kenya that is a favorite of safari tourists, the Kenya Wildlife Service said in a statement.\n\n“Craig, the legendary super tusker famed for its immense, ground-sweeping tusks and calm, dignified presence, passed on at the age of 54,\" the statement said.\n\nThe Amboseli Trust for Elephants said Craig had died of natural causes. The conservation group said it was grateful to everyone who worked to help the animal “live out his life naturally.”\n\nLocal broadcaster NTV aired a segment on the death of Craig, saying of the elephant that it was a rare creature as “one of the last remaining elephants identified as super tuskers in Africa.”\n\nThe term describes a bull elephant with tusks that weigh over 45 kilograms each. Tusks that size are so long that they scrape the ground as the elephant walks, according to the Tsavo Trust, a non-profit conservation group in Kenya. Females that grow long tusks are called iconic cows, the group says.\n\nIn Amboseli National Park, a protected area whose vegetation ranges from savannah woodland to open grasslands near the Tanzania border, Craig stood out as an attraction to tourists and a notable creature to conservationists working to protect elephants from poachers and other threats.\n\nThe elephant was said to be calm, “often pausing patiently as visitors photographed and filmed him,” the statement by Kenya Wildlife Service said.\n\nIn 2021, Craig was adopted by beer maker East African Breweries through its popular Tusker brand, reflecting his prominence but also underscoring collaboration between conservation groups and others in Kenya.\n\nKenya’s national parks and reserves are home to a variety of wildlife species and attract millions of visitors annually, making the country a tourism hotspot.\n\nThe elephant population has grown from 36,280 in 2021 to 42,072 in 2025, the latest official figures show.\n\nIn the Mwea National Reserve, a protected area east of the Kenyan capital of Nairobi, the elephant population grew spectacularly, overwhelming the ecosystem and requiring the relocation of about 100 elephants in 2024.\n\nThe African savanna elephant is the largest land animal. Adult males weigh about six tons. Craig “fathered a number of calves, ensuring that his powerful bloodline and gentle character live on across generations,\" the wildlife service said.\n\n___ Muhumuza reported from Kampala, Uganda.",

    "description": "William and Simone Butler were 1,200 miles off the Costa Rica coast when their boat sank",
    "fullText": "In 1989, a couple set out on a yachting adventure\n\nWilliam and Simone Butler were 1,200 miles off the Costa Rica coast when their boat sank\n\nFrom there, they took to a life raft — where they survived for 66 days adrift in the Pacific Ocean\n\nIt's a story fairly familiar to anyone who's followed orca activity in recent years: a couple was shipwrecked when their yacht was surrounded and sunk by a group of whales off the coast of Costa Rica. But what happened next was altogether different, with the two enduring 66 days adrift in the Pacific Ocean in a rubber raft, saved by a tiny device aptly named \"Survivor.\"\n\nWilliam and Simone Butler were three weeks into a journey attempting to circumnavigate the globe on their 40-foot yacht, roughly 1,200 miles off the coast, when they were sunk by whales on June 15, 1989.\n\nThe two scrambled to grab food, fishing gear and a 7-lb. pump called the \"Survivor-35\" — a manually operated pump that converts saltwater to fresh water — before getting into a rubber raft.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nThat quick thinking proved integral, as the two would be stuck in the raft for 66 days, adrift in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nFor more than two months, they subsisted mostly on raw fish and \"a precious three liters of potable water that William,\" then aged 60, squeezed out of the Survivor each day, per PEOPLE's reporting at the time.\n\nAt the end of the 66-day ordeal, William and Simone, then 52, were rescued by the Costa Rican Coast Guard and taken to a hospital in the coastal city of Golfito.\n\nDespite the odds, the two were in relatively good health (other than being dehydrated and severely sunburned). From his hospital bed, William told reporters they had caught fish daily, saying, \"I forced myself to eat almost 2 lbs. of raw fish a day, and I forced my wife to eat it too.\"\n\nEven with the fish, both William and Simone lost a reported 50 lbs. each during the ordeal.\n\nFollowing their recovery, the couple arrived back in the states, with William telling reporters, \"It's hard to believe that seven days ago we were still adrift, trying to make landfall. Really, it's hard to discuss the situation.\"\n\nThe couple said they fended off shark attacks and fish feeding frenzies during the ordeal and had been contacted about turning their story into a book or movie.\n\nBut in the aftermath, they were more content to stay on solid ground. \"We're going to rest - and go away from the ocean for a while, to the mountains, the prairies,\" William said at the time, per PEOPLE's reporting.\n\nPer an obituary, William died in June 2024, with his wife dying some years earlier.\n\nEven his obituary recounted his sailing adventures, which began at age 14, when \"he skippered his first blue water voyage from Havana to Varadero on his 15-foot Snipe.\"\n\n\"Bill went on to skipper countless voyages, including treasure hunting, fishing, three transatlantic voyages, rounding Cape Horn, and an attempted circumnavigation which ended when his sailboat Siboney was sunk by whales,\" the obituary read.\n\n\"Over the course of Bill's sailing years, he logged over 74,000 nautical miles at sea with his children, grandchildren, and numerous crewmembers aboard his two mistresses of the sea, Siboney and New Chance.\"",

    "description": "Brian Moynihan says the fears are understandable, but urges young grads not to lose hope about the job market.",
    "fullText": "Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan says the headlines about Gen Z’s fears about AI and the job market are real.\n\nThe bank recently hired 2,000 top grads from 200,000 applications, the executive said in an interview with CBS News‘ Margaret Brennan on Face the Nation. As companies cite AI for widespread layoffs, Moynihan acknowledges that many young people feel scared and uncertain about the future.\n\n“My advice to those kids, if you ask them if they’re worried about, they say they’re worried about—these are kids that we hire, 200,000 applications, we hire 2000 people.” Moynihan added that “if you ask them if they’re scared, they say they are. And I understand that. But I say, harness it … It’ll be your world ahead of you,” Moynihan said.\n\nMoynihan said it’s too soon to say how AI will play out in the job market, but he hopes to use efficiencies created by the technology to invest in more growth.\n\n“We want to drive more growth. So the AI will be spent—the efficiencies from AI will be spent to keep growing the company, I think,” he said.\n\nMoynihan also said Americans are focusing too much on the Fed and its impact on the economy. He argued that the private sector is a more important driver of economic growth.\n\n“The idea that we are, like, hanging on the thread by the Fed moving rates 25 basis points, it seems to me we’ve gotten out of whack,” he said.\n\nJerome Powell and multiple economists have validated that Gen Z is facing a genuine “hiring nightmare,” especially for recent college graduates trying to land their first white-collar job. This is tied to a low‑hire, low‑fire labor market, the rapid automation of entry‑level roles, and a tech industry whose workforce is getting older as Gen Z’s presence shrinks.\n\nIn September 2025, Powell used his post‑meeting press conference to highlight an “interesting labor market” where “kids coming out of college and younger people, minorities, are having a hard time finding jobs.” He emphasized that the job-finding rate is “very, very low” even as layoffs remain subdued, creating a stagnant low‑hiring, low‑firing environment that is particularly punishing for new entrants. Asked whether AI was to blame, he called it “probably a factor” but not the main driver, suggesting that slower overall job creation plus some AI substitution is squeezing young workers at precisely the moment they try to get on the ladder.\n\nEmployers are using AI to automate the predictable, process‑heavy tasks that once justified many junior roles, especially in corporate and tech settings. Platforms that track early‑career hiring, like Handshake, point to a double squeeze: entry‑level job postings in corporate roles are down roughly 15% year over year, while references to “AI” in job descriptions have jumped about 400% over two years. Economists like Dartmouth’s David Blanchflower tell Fortune that even when young people do find work, they report rising “despair” and a pervasive “this job sucks” sentiment, compounding the effect of higher recent‑grad unemployment rates compared with the national average.",

    "fullText": "A baffled reporter shouted out after President Donald Trump spent 20 minutes rambling at a press conference on his strike and capture of President Nicolás Maduro, asking him to “explain” himself.\n\nNews broke after midnight Friday that the United States struck Venezuela’s capital of Caracas early Saturday morning, and at 4:21 AM, Trump announced on Truth Social that Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores were captured and flown to the United States.\n\nTrump spoke at a  press conference in Florida Saturday morning, during which he opened with a wandering opening statement that included the repeated claim that “we’re going to run the country.”\n\nWhen he tossed to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, a reporter tried to circle back to that claim:\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We knocked out 97 percent. And those drugs mostly come from a place called Venezuela. We’re going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper, and judicious transition.\n\nSo we don’t want to be involved with having somebody else get in, and we have the same situation that we had for the last long period of years. So we are going to run the country until such time as we could do a safe, proper and judicous transition.\n\nAnd it has to be judicious, because that’s what we’re all about. We want peace, liberty, and justice for the great people of Venezuela, and that includes many from Venezuela that are now living in the United States and want to go back to their country, it’s their homeland.\n\nWe can’t take a chance if somebody else takes over Venezuela that doesn’t have the good of the Venezuelan people in mind. Decades of that. We’re not going to let that happen.\n\nWe are there now, and what people don’t understand, but they understand as I say this, we’re there now. But we’re going to stay until such time as the proper transition can take place.\n\nSo we’re gonna stay until such time, we are gonna run it essentially until such a time as a proper transition can take place.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Thank you very much.\n\nREPORTER: Can you explain how the US will run Venezuela?\n\nThe post Baffled Reporter Shouts Out After Rambling Trump Weave On Blockbuster Strike: ‘Can You Explain…’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "Cynthia Diekema, 61, was killed by an alligator while on a canoe ride with her husband in Florida last year",
    "fullText": "Cynthia Diekema, 61, was canoeing with her husband last year when they crashed into an alligator in their canoe and both fell into the water, according to a report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission recently obtained by PEOPLE\n\nThroughout the attack, he said that his wife seemed alert, but unable to speak and had a \"puzzled look on her face\"\n\nHer cause of death was listed as “multiple blunt force injuries from an alligator,\" according to the report.\n\nNew details have emerged about an alligator attack that claimed the life of a 61-year-old woman as her husband fought to save her life.\n\nOn May 6, around 4:02 p.m. local time, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission responded to an alligator encounter near the mouth of Tiger Creek in Polk County.\n\nThe woman, later identified as Cynthia Diekema, was canoeing with her husband when they encountered the reptile and both fell into the water, the FWC later shared.\n\nThe 11-foot, 4-inch alligator then bit Cynthia and pulled her into the water before she was \"later found deceased.\"\n\nNearly eight months after the attack, an incident summary report from the FWC, which was obtained by PEOPLE via a public records request, revealed additional information about what happened on that horrifying day.\n\nIn a sworn statement to authorities, David Diekema, Cynthia’s husband, said that he and his wife were traveling on an 11-foot plastic canoe that departed earlier that day from Lake Kissimmee State Park.\n\nOnce they entered the shallow waters of Tiger Creek, David says that they observed numerous alligators — and right before the attack, his wife commented on how they were \"about to go right over top of one,\" according to the report.\n\nAs the canoe crashed into the animal, which was resting on the bottom of the creek, the startled animal began to thrash, according to the report, which caused the canoe to capsize and sent the couple into the water.\n\nWhen he was able to stand up, David said he saw Cynthia’s torso in the alligator’s mouth.\n\nAccording to officials, he said he \"attempted to free her from the alligator's mouth for several minutes,\" but was unsuccessful.\n\nThroughout the ordeal, he said that his wife seemed alert, but unable to speak and had a \"puzzled look on her face.\"\n\nAt one point, the alligator whipped its tail, knocking David off of his feet, according to the report. During that time, he also said the alligator \"momentarily released\" his wife before biting her again on the shoulder.\n\nAfter regaining his balance, he tried once again to free his wife from the alligator's mouth, however the alligator then \"conducted a death roll and immediately swam away with Mrs. Diekema in its mouth.\"\n\nKnowing that time was of the essence, David — who lost his phone during the ordeal — bailed as much water as he could from the canoe and paddled north of Tiger Creek until he reached Lake Kissimmee, per the report. There he was rescued by a good Samaritan in an airboat.\n\nAbout 20 minutes into their search, the FWC recovered Cynthia's body and EMS pronounced her dead at the scene. The alligator was captured and euthanized around 7:30 p.m. local time that same day.\n\nA coroner later performed an autopsy and shared their findings with the FWC, detailing numerous injuries, including the amputation of her right arm below the shoulder.\n\nThey stated that the preliminary cause of Cynthia’s death was “multiple blunt force injuries from an alligator” and the manner of death was ruled as an “accident,\" according to the report.\n\nThe day after the incident, investigators returned to the scene to find any other alligators that were involved in the attack and to capture those that are potentially dangerous in the Tiger Creek area. One alligator was dispatched by an officer and moved onto an airboat bound for Kissimmee Park. No other gators were located.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\n“The FWC extends its deepest sympathies to the family and friends of the victim during this difficult time,” the department said in a previous statement.\n\nCynthia was from Paw Paw, Mich., and is survived by her husband David, two children and two grandchildren, per her obituary.\n\n\"She radiated her inner and outer beauty in all she did and had unconditional love for everyone,\" the obituary read. \"She cherished her family and every moment and adventure they spent together.\"",

    "description": "Embattled Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan, who was convicted of obstruction last month for helping an immigrant evade federal officers, has sent her resignation letter to the governor.  A spokesperson for Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, said his office received Dugan's letter, and he would work to fill the vacancy without delay.

    "fullText": "Embattled Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan, who was convicted of obstruction last month for helping an immigrant evade federal officers, has sent her resignation letter to the governor.\n\nThe letter was sent Saturday. Republicans had been making plans to impeach her ever since her Dec. 19 conviction. A spokesperson for Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, said his office received Dugan's letter, and he would work to fill the vacancy without delay.\n\nDugan wrote that over the past decade she handled thousands of cases with “a commitment to treat all persons with dignity and respect, to act justly, deliberately and consistently, and to maintain a courtroom with the decorum and safety the public deserves.”\n\nBut she said the case against her is too big of a distraction.\n\n“As you know, I am the subject of unprecedented federal legal proceedings, which are far from concluded but which present immense and complex challenges that threaten the independence of our judiciary. I am pursuing this fight for myself and for our independent judiciary,” Dugan said in her letter.\n\nLast April, federal prosecutors accused Dugan of distracting federal officers trying to arrest a Mexican immigrant outside her courtroom and leading the man out through a private door. A federal jury convicted her of felony obstruction.\n\nThe case against Dugan was highlighted by President Donald Trump as he pressed ahead with his sweeping immigration crackdown. Democrats insisted the administration was trying to make an example of Dugan to blunt judicial opposition to the operation.\n\nRepublican Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos praised Dugan's decision.\n\n“I’m glad Dugan did the right thing by resigning and followed the clear direction from the Wisconsin Constitution,\" Vos said.\n\nDemocrat Ann Jacobs, who is chair of the Wisconsin Elections Commission board, said she agreed with Dugan that Milwaukee should have a permanent judge in place while this fight plays out.\n\n“Despite her situation, she is ever the champion of justice, wanting to remove the judiciary from a political battle over her fate. I’m sure this is terribly hard for her but she is true to her faith and her principles,” Jacobs said in a post on X.\n\nOn April 18, immigration officers went to the Milwaukee County courthouse after learning 31-year-old Eduardo Flores-Ruiz had reentered the country illegally and was scheduled to appear before Dugan for a hearing in a state battery case.\n\nDugan confronted agents outside her courtroom and directed them to the office of her boss, Milwaukee County Chief Judge Carl Ashley, because she told them their administrative warrant wasn’t sufficient grounds to arrest Flores-Ruiz.\n\nAfter the agents left, she led Flores-Ruiz and his attorney out a private jury door. Agents spotted Flores-Ruiz in the corridor, followed him outside and arrested him after a foot chase. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced in November he had been deported.",

    "description": "The world may no longer fully live in the grip of COVID-19, but another heavily contagious disease is currently spreading through U.S. airports.",
    "fullText": "In 2020, COVID-19 caused travel restrictions and other changes to how people get around. Avoiding getting sick while traveling is tricky, as COVID-19, flu, and common colds easily spread when dozens of people sit shoulder to shoulder inside planes, trains, or buses. However, another disease has added itself to the list. Measles is on the rise, and health officials have detected it in airports.\n\nThe New Jersey Department of Health sent a press release stating that it detected measles in a traveler who was at the Newark Liberty International Airport on December 12, 2025. The department has undertaken contact tracing efforts in case the passenger infected others. Another case appeared in a passenger who flew to and from Boston Logan International Airport (one of the busiest in the country) on December 11 and 12.\n\nThe Massachusetts Department of Public Health sent a press release of its own. The press release emphasized that measles is preventable through vaccines, making the nationwide rise in cases all the more surprising. Per the Centers for Disease Control, over 2,000 people in the U.S. tested positive for measles in 2025, numbers not seen since 1992.\n\nGavi, an organization working to increase medical vaccine access worldwide, explained that measles is the most contagious virus based on how many others just one person can infect, a measurement called R0. Like COVID-19 and the flu, measles spreads through particles in the air after someone carrying the disease coughs or sneezes. Its particles also linger in the air for up to two hours, meaning you can catch measles even without direct contact. After around two centuries of documented measles existence, researchers created a vaccine in the 1960s.\n\nVaccine skeptics have long existed around the world, but recent years have seen a higher percentage of parents choosing not to vaccinate their children. Gavi attributes this to vaccine misinformation, the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, and other global crises. Multiple health officials have publicly tried to ease people's minds by stating that vaccines are safe and effective as long as enough members of a population receive them.\n\nGetting measles despite being vaccinated is incredibly uncommon, but all travelers can take solace in the fact that cases are still fairly low nationwide. If you think you might be sick, wearing a mask can prevent you from spreading anything.\n\nReady to discover more hidden gems and expert travel tips?

    "description": "As impressive as the teams of developers that create games are, sometimes I am more blown away by the passion of the communities that build up around them, and what comes out of them. As more and more games are being made with software that is more available for general public use, like Unreal Engine, Blender, and Unity, this means that fans are able to try their hand at making custom creations to add into their favorite games, or even full-blown tools that help others do so.\nFrom clever randomizers to giant adjustments to the base game, these are some of the best fan mods and creations released in 2025.",
    "fullText": "on January 3, 2026 at 12:00PM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nAs impressive as the teams of developers that create games are, sometimes I am more blown away by the passion of the communities that build up around them, and what comes out of them. As more and more games are being made with software that is more available for general public use, like Unreal Engine, Blender, and Unity, this means that fans are able to try their hand at making custom creations to add into their favorite games, or even full-blown tools that help others do so.\n\nFrom clever randomizers to giant adjustments to the base game, these are some of the best fan mods and creations released in 2025.\n\nWhile the Castlevania: Symphony of the Night randomizer isn't anything new, what modder Mottzilla has managed to do is on another level: It's an integrated randomizer inside the game itself. This randomizer comes with various presets and options to let you customize your randomized experience of SotN, letting you swap around where abilities are, starting items, and more, without having the need to create and download a new seed every time you want to play. As an extra bonus, this mod will also work on original hardware, including PSX and PS2 systems, so long as you have a way to play backups. Enjoy Castlevania: Symphony of the Night in a new way, every time you play with this mod!\n\nWhile Metal Gear Solid 3 Delta may be the hot new Snake on the block, that doesn't mean that earlier versions of that classic game haven't gotten some love too this year. Metal Gear Solid 3 in the Master Collection Vol. 1 has received a randomizer mod courtesy of Great0ne. This randomizer shakes up your typical MGS3 playthrough by changing every pickup, including weapons, items, medic supplies, camo, and food, with some other options like random vomit or fake death being possible should you wish. This is a great way to really test those Big Boss skills of yours and whether or not you deserve the title.\n\nKeeping on the randomizer train, one of the more popular ways to play these sorts of mods is via a unique interconnected method known as Archipelago. This multi-world mod/community has developed ways to tether and let people play multiple different games together, where you can pick up items from a completely different game that someone else in your group is playing, and vice versa. As an example, someone could be playing Pokemon Red and get rewarded with the Super Metroid Morph Ball for beating a gym, letting the person playing Super Metroid now have access to the upgrade. With new games being added all the time to the pool of options and larger groups teaming up to tackle games together, 2025 marked the best year yet for Archipelago.\n\nWith a passionate team of almost 40 fans and organized by prominent fighting game YouTuber and streamer Maximilian Dood, this massive mod for Marvel Vs. Capcom Infinite overhauls the visuals of the 2017 fighter, giving it a gorgeous comic book look, updates movesets, new outfits, new music, and even adds in a brand-new four-player game mode. This passion project is a must-have for any MVC fans.\n\nCombining the first three Mega Man X games on the Super Nintendo into a single game, the Route MatriX Randomizer lets you jump between the three to search for armor pieces, weapons, upgrades, and access to new levels. Your goal is to defeat all three versions of Sigma, but first, you will need to discover the keys to his levels. For fans of these classic action platformers, the Route MatriX randomizer is an impressive new way to play.\n\nWhile each mod is its own, this slot is actually four mods in one. Created by theadamrippon, this gives the DX color treatment to the original three Final Fantasy Legend games and Final Fantasy Adventure, which were all released on the original Game Boy back in the early '90s. While labeled Final Fantasy Legend in the West, these were actually the original three SaGa entries, with Adventure being the original Mana game, both of which would go on and grow as their own beloved series over the decades, with new releases still coming out today. These beautiful mods present the original games in color, making them really pop.\n\nOblivion's companions are neat and all, but wouldn't it be cooler if you could hang out around Cyrodiil with a bear or one of those annoying mudcrabs? Mod creator Shadedness thinks so, and thus their \"Beast Mastery - Tame Beast Pets - Permanent Summons\" mod was born for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered. With this installed, not only will you have some fuzzy friends tagging along on your adventures, but you will be able to command them to a limited extent, feeding them to gain better buffs with them, and even level them up. Now get out there and get yourself a mountain lion.\n\nDesigned around the \"legacy\" philosophy whose goal is to make the perfect version of a game, TheSmithPlays created this mod to help do just that for Fire Emblem 7: The Blazing Blade. It was the first Fire Emblem game to come to the West, where it was referred to simply as Fire Emblem. Fire Emblem Legacy tweaks stages, weapon effectiveness, characters, and a host of other aspects of the classic title, resulting in a product that feels like how we remember Fire Emblem being when American audiences first met Eliwood, Lynn, and Hector back in 2003.\n\nThe tale of Cecil Harvey's redemption and struggle against Zeromus has made Final Fantasy IV one of the most beloved entries in Square's legendary franchise, but one thing it has always been missing is a job system. Thankfully, modder S34n4e has rectified this omission with the release of Final Fantasy 4 - Job System, a mod that adds 14 discoverable jobs that give you more flexibility with your party. Each job comes complete with a unique sprite, attributes, abilities, and more to make each one feel worthwhile, resulting in a wildly new-feeling FFIV.\n\nThe Monster Hunter series has always opted to hide numbers from players, such as boss health, stat build-up, and more. This year's Monster Hunter Wilds continues that approach, but this overlay mod pulls back the curtain and gives you all the stats and data you want to help you coordinate your hunts and strategies with your friends.\n\nThe right track can elevate moments from being exciting to legendary, and this mod from BRYN4444 for Dragon Ball Sparking Zero adds in more than 200 tracks from the Japanese release of the anime and films. Now you can hurl beams and clash with your friends to your favorite tunes from the anime. A similar mod is also available that adds tracks from previous DBZ games if that is more your style.\n\nPokemon Lazarus by Nemo622 is a complete overhaul mod of Pokemon Emerald that features a brand-new region based on Greece--the Illos Region--among many other new goodies to discover, such as a hard mode, a day/night system, and minigames. For trainers looking for more Pokemon goodness after finishing ZA, Pokemon Lazarus is a masterclass in Pokemon fan mods.\n\nThe long-awaited Hollow Knight expansion-turned-sequel, Silksong, finally released this year and has delighted (and infuriated) fans with its tight platforming and tough challenges. In this mod created by XvX, two players can play through the game together, with a cool new revive mechanic that lets you heal your teammate if they go down. Sometimes it's nice to suffer together with a friend.\n\nFrom Software's souls-likes are great fun when playing with friends, and this year's Elden Ring Nightreign highlights this fact better than any other. Created by a user named Yui, the Seamless Co-op mod allows up to six players to play together (up from the official max of two or three) and see each other in the Roundtable Hold. It can also adjust enemy scaling to make runs easier or more challenging.\n\nBack when Starfield came out in 2023, in our review, we found that despite its satisfying gunplay and some captivating quest lines, it struggled to deliver a memorable RPG that lives up to the studio's pedigree. Leave it to the passion of the Bethesda modding community, though, to put together mind-blowing, awesome mods--enter Star Wars Genesis. This total conversion modlist, which recently got its eleventh update of the year and which we featured on our list of the best Starfield mods, continues to mold Starfield into what could end up being the best Star Wars RPG out there. With custom storylines, bosses, dungeons, armor, weapons, and more, Star Wars Genesis just continues getting better.\n\nSuper Metroid: X-Fusion from Metaquarium and team feels like an artifact pulled straight out of another reality, one where Metroid Fusion was released on the SNES and was far more difficult. This impressive mod is a total overhaul of Super Metroid, combining aspects of both it and its portable sequel into an all-new retelling of the Fusion story. With cutscenes, new bosses, new areas, and redone Fusion bosses, just to name a few of its features, X-Fusion is an ideal option for Metroid aficionados looking for a challenge.\n\nReleased back in July, The Final Empire update for Anbennar--a fantasy total-conversion mod for Europa Versalis IV--brought with it a host of new features and goodies. Special to The Final Empire itself are new mission trees, religions, and a custom UI to add even more personality to this project. If the idea of adding elements of the epic fantasy genre into Europa Versalis--including schools of magic, a world rich in its own lore, and races including orcs, elves, and dwarves--then Anbennar is the mod for you.\n\nThe updated release of Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles marks the first time in quite a while that players can easily play this tactical RPG masterpiece, and its debut on PC. Being based on the original PSX release, some things were lost that had been introduced in the PSP remake, including the Dark and Onion Knight jobs. Luckily, those jobs are missing no more thanks to TriggerHappy's mod, bringing them back in, complete with their PSP sprites. This mod also adds a page system to the Job menu, which will hopefully allow for new jobs to get added in down the road. Either way, you will now be able to once again add these powerful professions to your roster of heroes.\n\nMany RPGs used to never be localized for Western markets, one of which was the PS2 remake of Sega's original Phantasy Star. This mod is a full retranslation of the original 2012 translation patch that fixes various errors and updates some terms to be \n\nKingdom Come Deliverance 2 from Warhorse Studios is perhaps one of the most immersive and complex RPGs that was released in 2025, but one divisive mechanic was its save system, which Unlimited Saving 2 addresses. Normally, in order to save, players need to craft Savior Schnapps items that would be consumed upon saving. This godsend of a mod by EddieShoe removes the need to spend these items to save, making KCD2 far more welcoming to try out different approaches and gameplay styles without the risk of burning through resources. And, to sweeten the deal even more, using this mod doesn't lock you out from earning achievements, so save to your medieval heart's content!",

    "fullText": "Senators and House members accuse Trump and his aides of disregarding the Constitution and lying to Congress.\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced on Truth Social on Saturday at 3:21 am, “The United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the Country. This operation was done in conjunction with U.S. Law Enforcement. Details to follow.”\n\nHours later, during a congratulatory press conference, Trump said that during a period of transition in Venezuela, “we’re going to run the country right.” But he gave only limited details of how the process would proceed, aside from saying, “We’re not afraid of boots on the ground.” Trump dwelt more on talk of prosecuting Maduro and his wife in a New York City courtroom.\n\nUS Attorney General Pam Bondi had already taken to social media earlier on Saturday morning with a message :“Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, have been indicted in the Southern District of New York. Nicolas Maduro has been charged with Narco-Terrorism Conspiracy, Cocaine Importation Conspiracy, Possession of Machineguns and Destructive Devices, and Conspiracy to Possess Machineguns and Destructive Devices against the United States. They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts.”\n\nBut in a brief predawn call with a New York Times reporter, Trump refused to discuss whether “he had sought congressional authority for the operation or what is next for Venezuela.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio later acknowledged that there had been no pre-attack consultation.\n\nAs it became clear that leaders of the Senate and House Armed Services committees had not been consulted on the regime-change attack and as confusion mounted about what would happen next in Venezuela, key members of Congress—who have the constitutionally defined authority to declare wars and to oversee major military actions—reacted angrily to what had transpired in the name of the United States but without the consent of the legislative branch.\n\n“A US invasion of Venezuela to depose its president and arrest him is illegal,” Tim Kaine, a Democratic senator from Virginia, told NPR Saturday morning. Kaine promised to seek a Senate vote next week to declare that Trump should not be waging this “unilateral presidentially declared war against Venezuela” without congressional authorization.\n\nKaine, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, issued a statement arguing, “President Trump’s unauthorized military attack on Venezuela to arrest Maduro—however terrible he is—is a return to a day when the United States asserted a right to dominate the internal affairs of all nations in the Western Hemisphere. The history is replete with failures, and doubling down on it makes it difficult to the claim with a straight face to other countries should respect the United States’ sovereignty when we do not do the same.”\n\n“Where will this go next?” asked Kaine. “Will the President deploy our troops to protect Iranian protesters? To enforce the fragile ceasefire in Gaza? To battle terrorists in Nigeria? To seize Greenland or the Panama Canal? To suppress Americans peacefully assembling to protest his policies? Trump has threatened to do all this and more and sees no need to seek legal authorization from people’s elected legislature before putting servicemembers at risk.”\n\nRepresentative Mark Pocan, a Wisconsin Democrat who has been one of the House’s most consistent critics of undeclared wars, warned that Trump has disregarded the Constitution. “President Trump has repeatedly been told he must consult with and get authorization from Congress to go to war, per US law. While we are only seeing early public accounts of what happened, it is clear he acted without doing that,” Pocan said. “Trump not notifying Democratic leadership, much less rank-and-file members, continues the degradation of the rule of law.”\n\nRepresentative James Walkinshaw, a Virginia Democrat who serves on the Military and Foreign Affairs Subcommittee of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Affairs, said, “Trump’s regime change war in Venezuela is flat out illegal and yet another betrayal of the commitments he made to the American people. He said he’d lower prices. He’s driving prices up. He said no ‘new stupid wars.’ He’s starting new stupid wars.”\n\nRepublican Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) initially went on social media and wrote, “I look forward to learning what, if anything, might constitutionally justify this action in the absence of a declaration of war or authorization for the use of military force.”\n\nLater, after receiving a call from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Lee made feeble excuses for the administration, claiming that the assault “likely” was justified by fears of “an actual or imminent attack.” But Washington Post national security analyst Josh Rogan wrote, “The United States has just kidnapped a foreign head of state and bombed a foreign capital using the justification of protecting U.S. personnel from an ‘actual or imminent attack’ according to Senator Lee. Make no mistake, President Trump just committed an act of war against Venezuela.”\n\nThe New York Times adopted a similar view in an editorial headlined “Trump’s Attack on Venezuela Is Illegal and Unwise.”\n\nAnd Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) dismissed claims by the president and the attorney general about the reasons for the regime change. “It’s not about drugs. If it was, Trump wouldn’t have pardoned one of the largest narco traffickers in the world [former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández] last month. It’s about oil and regime change. And they need a trial now to pretend that it isn’t. Especially to distract from Epstein + skyrocketing healthcare costs.”\n\nRepresentative Thomas Massie (R-KY) also expressed skepticism. “If this action were constitutionally sound,” Massie wrote on X, “the Attorney General wouldn’t be tweeting that they’ve arrested the President of a sovereign country and his wife for possessing guns in violation of a 1934 U.S. firearm law.”\n\nMaduro, according to election observers, almost certainly lost the 2024 presidential election and then refused to step down. Yet he had recently signaled an openness to meeting with Trump to discuss US allegations about drug trafficking and other issues. Trump has now executed a secret plan to remove the Venezuelan leader, even after Trump’s aides had denied regime-change plans.\n\nSenator Andy Kim, a New Jersey Democrat who served as a national security adviser under President Barack Obama, accused Trump’s secretaries of state and defense of lying to Congress about the administration’s intensions. “Secretaries Rubio and Hegseth looked every Senator in the eye a few weeks ago and said this wasn’t about regime change,” Kim said in a statement amid the first reports of US air strikes on Caracas. “I didn’t trust them then and we see now that they blatantly lied to Congress. Trump rejected our Constitutionally required approval process for armed conflict because the Administration knows the American people overwhelmingly reject risks pulling our nation into another war.”\n\nKim explained, “This strike doesn’t represent strength. It’s not sound foreign policy. It puts Americans at risk in Venezuela and the region, and it sends a horrible and disturbing signal to other powerful leaders across the globe that targeting a head of state is an acceptable policy for the U.S. government. This will further damage our reputation—already hurt by Trump’s policies around the world—and only isolate us in a time when we need our friends and allies more than ever.”\n\nSenator Brian Schatz, a Hawaii Democrat who is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said, “We have no vital national interests in Venezuela to justify war. We should have learned not to stumble into another stupid adventure by now.”\n\nSenator Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat who served in the US Marines from 2002 to 2006 and was deployed during the war in Iraq, bluntly declared, “This war is illegal.” “There is no justification for the United States to be at war with Venezuela. I lived through the consequences of an illegal war sold to the American people with lies,” explained Gallego. “We swore we would never repeat those mistakes. Yet here we are again. The American people did not ask for this, Congress did not authorize this, and our service members should not be sent into harm’s way for another unnecessary conflict.”",

    "title": "What the top US general revealed about how the surprise 'Absolute Resolve' raid to capture Maduro unfolded in Venezuela",
    "description": "Operation Absolute Resolve involved over 150 military aircraft, including fighter jets, helicopters, drones, and bomber planes.",
    "fullText": "More than 150 US military aircraft participated in the operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, including fighter jets, drones, bombers, and helicopters, the top US general said on Saturday.\n\nDan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that the \"audacious\" mission to extract Maduro — called \"Absolute Resolve\" — required months of meticulous planning and rehearsal, and involved forces from across the US military.\n\nCaine, speaking in Florida alongside President Donald Trump and other senior administration officials, said the US intelligence agencies spent months trying to find Maduro and map out various elements and patterns of his life. There were also detailed rehearsals, including the building of a replica of Maduro's compound, an approach the US applied to the 2011 Osama bin Laden raid.\n\nThere were limits to what Caine could share, but he was still able to provide substantial detail.\n\nShortly before 11 p.m. ET on Friday night, after waiting several days for favorable weather, Trump ordered US forces to proceed with the extraction operation.\n\nCaine said that during the \"darkest hours\" of the night, aircraft launched from 20 different bases, on land and at sea, across the Western Hemisphere.\n\nHelicopters carrying the US apprehension teams, including law enforcement officers and special operations forces, took off and flew to Venezuela, flying around 100 feet above the water.\n\nAs they approached the shores, military forces established a path forward, while Marine, Navy, and Air Force planes protected them from above. The US targeted Venezuelan military installations and defenses. Trump also shared that the military effectively turned off the lights using \"certain expertise.\" The darkness aided the infiltration.\n\nThe American aircraft included a mix of F-35 and F-22 stealth fighter jets, as well as F/A-18 fighter jets, EA-18 electronic attack jets, E-2 airborne early warning planes, B-1 bombers, and other unnamed support aircraft, as well as \"numerous\" drones, Caine said.\n\nAs the interdiction forces out to bag Maduro approached Caracas, the aircraft began to strike Venezuela's air defenses to ensure a safe passageway for the helicopters flying at low altitudes. Trump acknowledged that US military action had been telegraphed in advance, so the air defenses were ready. They were, however, met with a significant response.\n\n\"Those in the air over Caracas last night were willing to give their lives for those on the ground and in the helicopters,\" Caine said of the planes providing air cover.\n\nUS strikes and other layered effects, Caine said, helped ensure the forces pushing into downtown Caracas had \"totally the element of surprise.\"\n\nThe helicopters carrying the extraction team arrived at Maduro's compound shortly after 1 a.m. ET and took heavy fire. The apprehension force stormed the facility and took the Venezuelan president and his wife into custody. Trump said that they attempted to make it into a steel safe room but were unable to get the door closed.\n\nAmerican forces then withdrew from the country, with fighters and drones covering the exfiltration. By roughly 3:30 a.m. ET, US forces were over the water.\n\nThey flew Maduro and his wife to the amphibious assault ship USS Iwo Jima. Trump later published a photo of the Venezuelan president aboard the ship, where he was seen wearing a blindfold and ear protection while holding a bottle of water.\n\nUS officials said that there were no equipment or troop losses; however, Trump said earlier that \"a couple of guys were hit\" during the raid. The Pentagon and White House did not respond to questions for additional details on injuries to American personnel. A helicopter was also hit \"pretty hard,\" Trump said, but it remained flyable.\n\nThe scale and coordination of what Trump called a \"very complex\" operation resemble those of the June 2025 strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities, which also involved dozens of US military aircraft, with officials underscoring the key element of surprise.\n\nThe US established a significant military presence in the Caribbean Sea in recent months, including warships and aircraft. Troops, planes, and other assets have been very active, and the Trump administration has been repeatedly threatening to strike Venezuela, accusing the country's leadership of facilitating drug trafficking, among other criminal activity. Maduro rejected these claims.\n\nThe US has carried out dozens of strikes against alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, killing more than 100 people in a campaign that drew criticism from legal experts and lawmakers. The US stopped short of hitting targets inside Venezuela, at least until a recent CIA operation.\n\nThe significant operation on Saturday marks a major escalation and throws into question the future of Venezuela's leadership. Trump said the US is going to \"run the country\" until it can ensure a safe transition of power, while also encouraging American oil companies to become involved in the Venezuelan oil industry.\n\nMeanwhile, Attorney General Pamela Bondi said Maduro has been indicted in the Southern District of New York and charged with various drug-related offenses.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump revealed key details of the US military assault on Venezuela during a press conference on Saturday.\n\nFrom Mar-a-Lago in Florida, Trump addressed the operation, including the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, who have been indicted by a US federal court.\n\nHere's what Trump said about the mission, the capture of the Venezuelan leader, and what comes next.\n\nTrump called the operation against Venezuelan leadership, which occurred overnight and into the early morning, \"an extraordinary military operation\" involving the use of assets and weapons across air, land, and sea domains. Other officials revealed that intelligence, space, and cyber assets were involved as well.\n\nDuring the press conference, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine said the apprehension mission, called Absolute Resolve, involved over 150 aircraft, including fighter jets, bombers, electronic warfare planes, intelligence and surveillance aircraft, helicopters, and drones.\n\nSome assets disabled Venezuelan defenses and provided cover, while others were involved in infiltration and extraction.\n\nThe US president said that the assault targeted \"a heavily fortified military fortress in the heart of Caracas,\" where Maduro was captured during the night. He added that the US used \"certain expertise\" to turn off the lights in Caracas and that the Venezuelan military was overwhelmed by US forces.\n\nAmong the most important discussion points of the president's press conference is that the US will run Venezuela \"until such time as we can do a safe, proper, and judicious transition.\"\n\nExactly how the Trump administration plans to do this, and for how long, remains unknown. By law, Maduro's vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, should assume power. Trump added that Rodríguez \"really doesn't have a choice\" but to accept US involvement.\n\nWhen speaking on who would be in charge of this plan, Trump pointed to the officials standing behind him at the conference, including Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy and homeland security advisor, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Caine.\n\nAdditionally, Trump said, the biggest US oil companies will be going to Venezuela to \"spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country.\"\n\nVenezuela is home to the world's largest proven crude oil reserves. The US has been seizing and blockading oil tankers in recent months as part of the escalating tension between Maduro and the Trump administration. Trump has said the US built Venezuela's oil industry and intends to take it back, accusing Caracas of using the money to fund narco-terrorism and other criminal activities.\n\nDuring the conference, Trump said the US was ready to conduct a second attack, \"a much bigger wave,\" on Venezuela if needed.\n\n\"We actually assumed that a second wave would be necessary, but now it's probably not,\" the president said, pointing to the success of the first attack.",

This increased production could push already-depressed crude oil prices even lower.\n\nAs shown in the chart below, crude oil has fallen sharply since the start of last year.\n\nAny US companies that start drilling in Venezuela will face a catch-22: The more oil they add to the world's existing surplus, the further prices will fall, and the less profit they'll reap for their drilling efforts.\n\nHow they decide to proceed will ultimately shape the price of oil — and what normal consumers pay to live their lives.",

    "description": "New imagery obtained by Business Insider shows widespread damage at a military complex in the southern part of Caracas.",
    "fullText": "New satellite imagery shows damage at a military facility in Caracas after the US carried out strikes as part of a surprise operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nThe new imagery, captured on Saturday by the US spatial intelligence firm Vantor and obtained by Business Insider, shows damage around the Venezuelan military complex at Fuerte Tiuna in the southern part of Caracas.\n\nFuerte Tiuna is a critical military installation in Venezuela. It houses defense ministries and major commands, official residences, and other major strategic infrastructure. It was a primary target of the US mission.\n\nThe new imagery reveals significant damage to military storage buildings and equipment at the complex, including several vehicles, as well as destroyed security buildings at a gate to the facility.\n\nPresident Donald Trump revealed earlier on Saturday that the US carried out a highly complex raid to capture Maduro and extract him from the country to face drug-related charges in New York. The White House in August had placed a $50 million bounty on his head.\n\nThe bold operation began late Friday night and continued into the early hours of the next day, with US military aircraft — including fighter jets, surveillance planes, bombers, and drones — striking Venezuela's air defenses to clear a path for apprehension forces to locate Maduro.\n\nVenezuela's government said US forces targeted military and civilian areas and strongly condemned the strikes. Video footage shared on social media showed helicopters above Caracas, with large explosions and plumes of smoke rising from the city.\n\nDan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters in Florida that the apprehension team, which included US law enforcement officers, broke into Maduro's fortified compound under heavy fire and took the Venezuelan president and his wife into custody.\n\nSeveral American personnel were injured in the raid, Trump revealed, and one helicopter took a hit. However, no one was killed, he said, and the US didn't lose any equipment. Maduro was flown to the US Navy amphibious assault ship USS Iwo Jima ahead of his transfer to New York.\n\nThe mission — dubbed \"Operation Absolute Resolve\" — followed months of escalating tensions between Trump and the Maduro regime and dozens of US military strikes against alleged narcotics-smuggling boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific.\n\nPrior to the mission, the US had established a large military presence around the Caribbean, and Trump had repeatedly threatened to pursue targets in Venezuela.\n\nCaine said that the audacious operation involved months of meticulous planning and rehearsal. That included building a replica of Maduro's compound, similar to what US special operations forces did ahead of the 2011 Osama bin Laden raid.\n\nThe operation on Saturday marks a significant escalation in the Trump administration's pressure campaign, which also saw the US seize Venezuela-linked oil tankers while imposing a naval blockade targeting sanctioned vessels.\n\nThe strikes raise questions about the future of Venezuela's leadership. Trump said the US will run the country\" until it can ensure a safe transition of power, although it's unclear how Washington will do that.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has been encouraging American oil companies to become involved in the Venezuelan oil industry.\n\nSome world leaders have reacted strongly to the operation, including some from countries near Venezuela, who criticized the mission. They were joined by some Democratic US lawmakers. Many Republicans voiced their support.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio explained to reporters in Florida on Saturday that the Trump administration did not notify Congress ahead of the operation and only informed members afterward. The president defended the decision.",

    "description": "A mother describes how her family was stranded in Puerto Rico after flight cancellations following the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Nilgen Velazco. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI woke up at 9 am on Saturday, January 3rd, thinking I'd start rushing around to get our family ready for our return flight to Colorado. My husband, Malcolm, and our two children, ages 8 and 4, have been in Camuy, Puerto Rico, visiting my family since December 12th and were due to leave today at 4 p.m. from San Juan.\n\nGroggy-eyed, I looked at my phone and saw I had an email from our airline — our flight had been canceled.\n\nMy mother, with whom we are staying, turned on the news, and that's when we saw what had happened in Venezuela while we had still been sleeping.\n\nI genuinely thought it must all be a dream.\n\nWhen Malcolm and I started planning this Christmas trip to Puerto Rico to visit my family — the first time we've ever done it — we'd had issues finding and booking flights because of the government shutdown.\n\nOnce we arrived, we had no idea that it would be an issue getting back home to Colorado. Things were stirring in Venezuela, an unfolding story I keep up with as my dad is Venezuelan, but we didn't think this would impact our trip in any way. It wasn't even on our radar.\n\nWe were completely shocked by the news this morning.\n\nI immediately got on the phone to try transferring our flights to another day. The person I was on the phone with kept telling us the seats were disappearing as she went to click on them, because everyone is in the same boat as us. We're all stuck here because all flights have been canceled out of Puerto Rico, desperate to book new flights.\n\nAfter an hour on the phone, we had managed to get tickets for Friday, six days from now. But we're unsure if that flight will get canceled, too. It's all very up in the air right now.\n\nWe're really lucky that we've got family to stay with. I know there are so many people who can't find hotels to stay in.\n\nEven though we have accommodation, this delay in getting home is going to have a big impact on us.\n\nWe had meticulously planned the finances for this trip, setting aside and saving exactly the amount we needed to make such a special trip. We aren't a wealthy family, so we had to scrimp to make this trip possible.\n\nHowever, since we can't return home, we'll end up spending several hundred dollars more than we expected on our pet sitter and airport parking, which will definitely be a financial strain on our family.\n\nOur 8-year-old is missing some standardized testing and school, and our 4-year-old daughter is booked in for preschool, which is nonrefundable.\n\nI will need to use my sick leave to cover the time I will be missing work, as I have already used my vacation leave for this trip and didn't bring my work laptop with me. Malcolm is the same.\n\nMy mom borrowed a car from a friend for us to use while we were here, and we've had to ask the friend to use the car a bit longer because you can't get around Puerto Rico without a car.\n\nWe know we aren't the only ones in this position. Today, we took the kids to the beach — trying to make the best of a bad situation — and met several families with kids going through exactly the same.\n\nIt's one thing to be stuck when it's just you, but adding kids to the equation makes it that much more difficult.\n\nWe're also nervous about what Venezuela might do in response to this attack, and if we'll still be here if and when something kicks off in Puerto Rico.\n\nWe just wanted to spend some time with my family for Christmas, something we've never done before, and then this happened. It's just really frustrating.",

    "description": "Pulling back from friendships showed me exactly who wanted me in their lives — and it finally quieted my lifelong fear of rejection.",
    "fullText": "Ever since I was a little girl, I remember that friendships were a priority for me; I would constantly ask my mom to let me have friends over for playdates and sleepovers.\n\nAs a teenager, I had a Nokia brick phone and a driver's license, and I could always be found planning to see friends or inviting them over to mine.\n\nThe craving for friendship has continued ever since, with my incessant desire for it fuelled by an innate need to feel accepted. I moved a number of times when I was a kid, and I fought against the outsider mentality by developing relationships that would help me become part of social circles.\n\nAs an adult, I moved from the US to Wales, and once again, had to find a way to fit in — through friendship.\n\nI invited myself to people's houses for coffee and asked them to go for walks with me. I texted and rang to check in on friends I had made through church, work, my kids' school, and my husband's previous social circles.\n\nThese friends were incredibly important to me, and I had to hold on to them. I felt the only way to do this was to maintain frequent contact, more often than not initiated by me.\n\nIn recent years, I found myself thinking: What would happen if I didn't text, call, or plan to meet up with friends? Would they get in touch with me?\n\nIt's led to little monthlong experiments — going quiet to see who I'd hear from, if anyone.\n\nThe results have been both disappointing and frustrating, yet reaffirming. There were some friends who didn't make any contact (and I felt rejected as a result), others who got in touch with me.\n\nAll of my childhood fears about exclusion and rejection were acutely felt once again.\n\nI had lots to think through. Did I mind being the one who initiated the friendship — the one who kept it going? Was my concept of friendship too intense for other people? Were there some friendships I was willing to put in the work, even if I felt it wasn't always reciprocated? Was I a needy friend?\n\nThis soul-searching led me to understand a few things about myself and the nature of friendship.\n\nI'm a loyal friend who values deep, meaningful relationships that require time and effort. I make space for close friends, even though I work full-time, am married, and have three children, and I crave friendships with people who share the same values. A twice-a-year check-in just doesn't do it for me. I want sisterhood.\n\nHowever, this is not necessarily a value that everyone else has, and that's OK. I suppose some people don't need such intense friendships. Or perhaps they already have them with family or other friends. I can't get frustrated with or feel rejected by friends who don't have the same idea of friendship as I do.\n\nTo avoid frustration and feelings of rejection, over the last year, I've decided to mentally note which friends want the depth of friendship I offer and those who are happy with a surface-level relationship.\n\nI leaned into those deep friendships (three of them) — people who valued relationships as much as I did. They feel like my village, those who depend on me, and those who I can depend on. They're the ones who check in with me, just as I check in on them. It's not me who initiates everything — they're texting and calling too. They're fiercely loyal.\n\nBut I stopped chasing friends who didn't seem to place the same value on friendship as I do. I didn't cut them out (and would happily still see them for a coffee), but I didn't prioritize contact as I had before. I didn't feel any resentment, but rather an understanding that we had different ideas of what friendship entailed. And that's totally OK — I can accept this without feeling rejected or unwanted. When we do see each other, at school gates, on the streets, or for an infrequent meet-up, I enjoy their company, expecting no more than they are able to give.\n\nAnd then, there were a couple of friends whom I knew I would have to initiate contact with if I wanted to maintain our friendship — I'd have to accept that for it to continue. I appreciated their friendships too much to only see or hear from them occasionally.\n\nOver the past year, with these changes in place, I feel completely content in my friendships, as I have never before. I know where I stand with friends, and as a result, don't feel rejected — no longer that child with an insatiable desire to be accepted by everyone. I know I'm wanted and loved, not by everyone, but by a few, and that's enough now.",

    "description": "From outbound vacationers to students returning for the new semester, the US raid on Venezuela disrupted travel across the region.",
    "fullText": "The US raid on Venezuela that netted President Nicólas Maduro and his wife on Saturday has sent surprised travelers into a mild tailspin.\n\nFlightradar24 data shows Venezuela's airspace is empty following the strikes. While US airlines haven't flown there for years, the Federal Aviation Administration on Saturday formally barred operations in Venezuelan airspace, essentially codifying an already de facto no-fly zone.\n\nBut the impact extends beyond Venezuela.\n\nAirlines are also avoiding nearby southern Caribbean airspace due to heightened security risks. Delta, American Airlines, and Southwest Airlines said they canceled flights to the Caribbean on Saturday morning following the US strike on Venezuela.\n\nThe cancellations have inconvenienced many travelers, particularly students returning for the start of the new semester.\n\n\"I don't know what I'm doing right now,\" Catalina Rodriguez, a veterinary student at Ross University School of Medicine in St. Kitts and Nevis, said in a video she posted to TikTok. \"One of my flights is good, my other flight is delayed, am I supposed to change my trip?\"\n\nRodriguez, 34, later told Business Insider in a call that she is supposed to start her third semester of veterinary school on Monday. She is scheduled to fly on American Airlines at noon on Sunday, but her flight is now delayed. She said she's also been in touch with several classmates who are stuck in airports due to cancellations and delays.\n\n\"We're just waiting to see what's going to happen,\" she said. \"It's a little stressful for sure.\"\n\nAnother student, who goes by \"dani la doctorcita\" on TikTok, said in a video that her Delta flight to St. Kitts was canceled. \"All US flights have been canceled,\" she said. \"Delta won't fly even from Puerto Rico.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that aviation risk-intelligence firm Osprey Flight Solutions — a widely used industry service that tracks safety and security hazards for airlines — recently upgraded its risk assessment for the Southern Caribbean Sea from \"moderate\" to \"high\" amid escalating tensions.\n\nThat higher-risk zone includes places like Puerto Rico, Aruba, Curaçao, the British and US Virgin Islands, Antigua & Barbuda, Saint Thomas, Grenada, Barbados, and parts of Trinidad & Tobago and Guyana. Mass disruptions to and from these destinations have left thousands stranded as airlines reassess safety risks and insurance exposure.\n\nStranded travelers have few options to depart Caribbean nations — and little help from airlines while they wait.\n\nBecause the disruptions stem from government action outside the airlines' control, carriers do not legally owe passengers compensation. That means meals, hotels, and ground transportation are not required under federal law, though airlines may offer assistance as a gesture of goodwill.\n\nOne X user who goes by Nate_F_Thurmond posted a photo of a group of stranded travelers in St. John.\n\n\"Passengers stranded in St John just learning that Caribbean Airspace is closed,\" they wrote. \"American, JetBlue, and Delta canceled flights. People are scrambling to find places to stay. Being told 3-5 days by the airlines. All this because of Venezuela??\"\n\nIn most cases, the only guaranteed option is rebooking, and travelers may struggle to find alternative accommodations while waiting for the next available flight.\n\nSome flights are still operating, but they are taking significant detours to avoid the region. American Airlines Flight 1512 from Georgetown, Guyana, to Miami on Saturday, for example, ditched its usual route east of Venezuela through the southern Caribbean and instead flew west around the area, adding roughly an hour of flight time.\n\nFor travelers who want to cancel or postpone their Caribbean holidays, most airlines — including Delta, United, American, Southwest, and JetBlue — are waiving change and cancellation fees as the situation continues. Some western Caribbean countries, such as the Dominican Republic and Jamaica, are not included on waiver lists.\n\nUS Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on Saturday afternoon that the FAA will lift airspace restrictions over the Caribbean and Venezuela \"when appropriate.\" His update came about 15 hours after the FAA issued an emergency notice in the region.\n\n\"Early this morning in support of the Department of War, the FAA restricted the airspace in the Caribbean and Venezuela to ensure the SAFETY of the flying public,\" Duffy wrote on X. \"When appropriate, these airspace restrictions will be lifted. Please work with your airlines directly if your flight has been impacted.\"",

This time there was to be no Connacht comeback.\n\nOff a dominant scrum, another area of Leinster's game that showed marked improvement after the turn, they again executed well with Prendergast delaying his pass perfectly to send Tector over for his second and Leinster's sixth.\n\nJust after the hour mark, that score ended the game as a contest and things quickly got worse for Connacht.\n\nFor Leinster's seventh try, Tector was provider rather than scorer, intercepting a Connacht pass before sprinting into space and finding O'Brien on his shoulder.\n\nWith five minutes remaining, wing JJ Kenny ran in from distance for a deserved try to round out the night's scoring.\n\nThe win marked Leinster's seventh in succession, a run that goes back to defeat by Munster at Croke Park back in October.\n\nDespite the recent domestic struggles of La Rochelle, however, the URC champions will surely expect a greater challenge next weekend when they return to European action in what will be a repeat of the 2022 and 2023 Champions Cup finals against Ronan O'Gara's side.\n\nLeinster: Frawley; O'Brien, Cooney, Tector, Kenny; Prendergast, Gibson-Park; Boyle, Sheehan (capt), Clarkson, McCarthy, Deeny, Mangan, Connors, Conan.\n\nReplacements: McCarthy, Cahir, Porter, O'Tighearnaigh, Deegan, Van der Flier, McGrath, Osborne.\n\nConnacht: Gilbert; Mullins, Hawkshaw, Aki, Treacy; Ioane, Devine; Buckley, Tierney-Martin, Bealham, Joyce, O'Connor, Murphy, Prendergast, Jansen.\n\nReplacements: De Buitlear, Bohan, Barrett, Murray, Boyle, Murphy, West, Forde.",

Umaga's conversion brought the hosts back to within a point with 23 minutes to play.\n\nIt was set up for a tense finish but Edinburgh held firm to record their first URC victory since late November, with Thompson's replacement Cammy Scott missing a late penalty.\n\nEdinburgh move on to three wins from eight in the division this season.\n\nEveritt's side return to Champions Cup action over the next two Fridays, at home to Gloucester then away to Bath.\n\nBenetton: Gallagher, Lynagh, Odogwu, Marin, Mendy, Umaga, Garbisi, Gallo, Bernasconi, Ferrari, N.

We didn't deserve anything from the game,\" he told BBC Match of the Day.\n\n\"There have been other games where I have stood here and said 'we've been competitive and the result has not gone our way'.\n\n\"It was a big shift from losing the game against Newcastle, which was very different from how we looked today.

A rolling line-out maul was sent towards the Zebre line, scrum-half Ben Afshar peeled off and drew the defence before popping inside for McDowall to glide over untouched.\n\nFull-back Smith continued his excellent recent form with a fabulous second try, showing tremendous pace and footwork to slice through the defence and go in under the sticks.\n\nZebre struck against the run of play when Bertaccini crossed, but Glasgow re-established the two-score advantage just before half-time when hooker Stephen finished off a driving maul.\n\nThe Italians were not done yet and powered a rolling maul over the line for substitute hooker Quattrini to dot down.\n\nWarriors dampened the visitors' enthusiasm with a brilliantly engineered fourth try to seal the bonus point.\n\nSome exquisite handling created space for Duncan Munn to deftly chip ahead and nobody was beating Dobie in the race to the corner. Weir, having entered the action a few minutes earlier, banged over the conversion from the touchline.\n\nGlasgow used the maul to great effect once again to send substitute Hiddleston over for try number five.\n\nThe sixth almost raised the Scotstoun roof as Dobie made a searing break up the touchline, stepped inside and found Weir to send the club great over for one final try before he moves into an academy coaching role.\n\nDobie added another to round off a very satisfying evening for Franco Smith's side.\n\nGlasgow Warriors: Smith, Munn, McDowall, Yule, Dobie, Hastings, Afshar, Schickerling, Stephen, Richardson, Oguntibeju, Williamson, Ferrie, Darge, Duncan.\n\nReplacements: Hiddleston, Sutherland, Talakai, Craig, Miller, Oliver, Weir, Lancaster.\n\nZebre: Pani, Belloni, Bertaccini, Lucchin, Batista, Roger, Dominguez, Buonfiglio, Klein, Pieretto, Canali, Carrera, Volpi, Bianchi, Ruggeri.\n\nReplacements: Quattrini, Franceschetto, Nocera, Milano, Odiase, Prinsloo, Montemauri, Morisi.",

They offered nothing.\n\n\"Players pulling out of challenges, not throwing themselves at the ball, it was as bad as I've seen from any team.\"\n\nOn an afternoon when his side were dragged further into the relegation fight, Nuno's verdict was equally damning.\n\nThe Hammers boss apologised to fans, saying: \"It was embarrassing.\n\n\"Today was the worst performance that we have had. I don't recall one day that I felt so bad in a football pitch.\n\n\"It's not about my future. It's about how can we get out of this situation, how can we improve and get the results that make us climb the table. This is what we are concerned about.\"\n\nThe Portuguese tactician took over from Graham Potter with the club 19th in September, but with the Hammers still languishing in the bottom three, is time running out for him and his players to affect the outcome?",

So, maybe I have to adapt.\"\n\nAmorim subsequently shifted to a four at the back formation for the 1-0 win against Newcastle on 26 December, before reverting to five at the back when United were held to a draw by bottom side Wolves four days later.\n\nOn 23 December, the day before Amorim's comment, United officials privately accepted their pursuit of Bournemouth's £65m attacker Antoine Semenyo was destined to end in failure, although they stressed the intention had never been to use the 25-year-old as a wing-back.\n\nSpeaking to journalists before his side's Premier League trip to Leeds on Sunday, Amorim was asked to explain why he did not know the position around recruitment when he joined United from Sporting in November 2024.\n\n\"I don't want to talk about that,\" he said. \"I just focus on the Leeds game.\"",

    "fullText": "Tries: Fischetti 2, Coles 3, Mitchell, Freeman, Todaro 2, F Smith Cons: F Smith 8\n\nTries: Cleaves, Dombrandt 2 Cons: M Smith 3\n\nAlex Coles scored a hat-trick as Northampton Saints produced an irresistible 10-try performance to demolish Harlequins and return to the top of the Prem table.\n\nSaints breached the Quins' defence almost at will in the first half with Danilo Fischetti, Coles, Alex Mitchell and Tommy Freeman all getting their names on the scoresheet.\n\nCassius Cleaves and Alex Dombrandt responded for Quins, but two further scores each from Coles and Edoardo Todaro in the second half, plus one from Fin Smith, secured another breathtaking Saints victory.\n\nThey will be concerned, however, about an injury suffered by captain Fraser Dingwall, who was carried off wearing a neck brace close to half-time.\n\nAfter Bath went to the top of the table with a dramatic win over Exeter earlier in the day, Northampton fell behind within minutes of the start.\n\nBenefitting from quick ball, the visitors drove into the Saints 22, before Marcus Smith eventually found Cleaves on a perfect line to split the home defence before dotting down.\n\nBoth sides then spurned chances, with George Turner inches away from a try on his first league start, before Saints levelled the scores.\n\nA scintillating break down the wing involving George Hendy and James Ramm brought them to the Quins' line, which was then promptly breached by the rampaging Fischetti.\n\nIn sparkling form, full-back Hendy was also instrumental in the Saints' second try, running a beautiful loop to isolate defenders, before offloading to Ramm who eventually fed Coles for another superb attacking score.\n\nA third soon followed for Phil Dowson's men, with Quins unable to deal with the speed of the attack, and quick offloading from Fischetti and Coles freed scrum-half Mitchell, who had no difficulty in reaching the line.\n\nFischetti then inflicted further pain on Quins by scoring his second from Mitchell's offload to secure the bonus point well before the interval.\n\nHarlequins responded with their second from a perfectly executed set-piece move from a line-out in the 22, the ball quickly recycled through Chandler Cunningham-South to Dombrandt, who dived over untouched in the corner.\n\nIt was to prove only a temporary respite as, with seemingly nothing on, Mitchell danced his way around multiple defenders in midfield before feeding Freeman, who evaded Nick David as Saints reached the interval 33-14 in front.\n\nThe game, unsurprisingly, did not continue at quite the same ferocious pace in the second half, but that did not prevent Saints from adding to their lead.\n\nCraig Wright was just one of numerous players battering at the Quins line, before the ball found its way to Coles, who proved unstoppable from point-blank range.\n\nTodaro then got in on the scoring, the Italy winger the beneficiary of further wizardry from Hendy to sprint away and dive over untouched.\n\nNorthampton's eighth try was more fortuitous than well-crafted, with Smith the happy recipient following a pass from Anthony Belleau that rebounded off the head of JJ van der Mescht.\n\nYet another spectacular score followed, however, when Todaro powered his way through four Quins tacklers to secure his brace before Dombrandt added his second as a consolation after a break from Rodrigo Isgro.\n\nSaints were not done, with Coles getting his hat-trick with the final score of the game as they returned to the top, two points clear of Bath.\n\nThe result left Harlequins in eighth, one point above Gloucester in ninth.\n\nNorthampton head coach Sam Vesty told BBC Radio Northampton:\n\n\"We scored some fantastic tries there, got the game going really fast and we're dangerous when we're like that.\n\n\"Slightly disappointed in our defence in the first half. I thought we were much better in the second half in that respect.\n\n\"Alex Coles has been excellent. He's always on the end of a line break and he's the best celebrator in the team - he's always next to the guy scoring a try but it's often him on the end of it.\"\n\nOn Fraser Dingwall: \"Fraser's up and about and smiling so all good in that respect. They [medics) are uber-careful and if it takes five or six minutes (to treat a player), it's the right thing to do.\"\n\nHarlequins head coach Jason Gilmore:\n\n\"If you keep copping those defeats, it's not going to be sustainable. That's pretty obvious.\n\n\"It's not just going to turn around overnight and we've got to be a clear as a club over what we need to do to make sure we're winning big games more consistently.\n\n\"We are where we are at the moment, we understand that. There's no magic formula to it, we've just got to make sure we keep stepping forward and hopefully get some bodies back on the field because the injuries are magnifying things.\n\n\"You're definitely going to lose confidence, there's no hiding from that. We're clear on what we want to go after.\"\n\nNorthampton: Hendy; Todaro, Freeman, Dingwall (capt), Ramm; F Smith, Mitchell; Fischetti, R Smith, Millar Mills, Coles, Van der Mescht, Kemeny, Pearson, Chick.\n\nReplacements: Wright, Scola, Kundiona, Prowse, Graham, McParland, Belleau, Hutchinson.\n\nHarlequins: David; Isgro, Northmore, Evans, Cleaves; M Smith, Friday; Hobson, Turner, H Williams, Pagadizábal, Treadwell, Cunningham-South, Kenningham, Dombrandt (capt).\n\nReplacements: Riley, Kerrod, Delgado, E Williams, Launchbury, Carr, Porter, Bradley.",
