    "fullText": "Switzerland's Camille Rast said she was racing for the victims of the New Year's Eve fire in her hometown of Crans-Montana as she ended Mikaela Shiffrin's winning start to the World Cup slalom season.\n\nRast, 26, produced a stunning second run in Sunday's slalom in Kranjska Gora to pip Shiffrin by 0.14 seconds, following up Saturday's debut World Cup giant slalom victory at the same Slovenian resort.\n\nUS star Shiffrin, 30, had won the opening five slalom events which, when added to her victory in the final slalom of last season, equalled her own record of six consecutive wins in the discipline.\n\n\"I gave it everything I had this weekend - achieving the double [slalom and giant slalom] was extraordinary,\" said Rast, who added: \"I think about all those families - we raced for them this weekend.\"\n\nA devastating fire at Le Constellation bar in the Swiss ski resort killed at least 40 people and injured 119 others.\n\nBodies continue to be identified and a criminal investigation is under way.\n\n\"We can't imagine how it is, but it's for sure terribly hard,\" Rast told BBC's Ski Sunday.\n\n\"I hope they will find the support with their family and everybody around. And I hope that the sport will bring a little smile on their face.\"\n\nRast finished a close second to Shiffrin in the previous World Cup slalom event in Austria but was not to be denied a second time, making sure the World Cup's greatest skier could not add to her record tally of 106 wins in all disciplines.\n\nShiffrin was just 0.1 seconds behind leader Rast after the first run, but set an imposing time in the second that opened a 1.69secs lead over the rest of the field.\n\nBut Rast went even faster to beat Shiffrin into second place.\n\n\"I know Shiffrin is really fast and I had to be really, really fast to beat her. I saw her start and I was like 'mmm, OK, that's good, that's really good', but I just tried to give my best, and it worked,\" she said.\n\nThere are two more World Cup slalom events - in Flachau, Austria, on 13 January, and Spindleruv Mlyn in the Czech Republic on 25 January - before the Winter Olympics begin in Milan-Cortina on 6 February.\n\nWatch Rast's victory and interview in the latest edition of Ski Sunday from 17:50 GMT on 4 January.\n\nGreat Britain had two cross-country skiers finish in the top 10 of a World Cup event for the first time in Val di Fiemme, Italy, on Sunday.\n\nBritain's Joe Davies, 24, was sixth - his best World Cup finish - while team-mate Andrew Musgrave, 35, was eighth in the men's 10km mass start free, more commonly known as the 'Final Climb'.\n\nMusgrave finished 15th and Davies 16th in the overall Tour de Ski standings - the first time the British team has had two skiers in the top 20.\n\nDavies told BBC Sport: \"To have the results we've had this Tour de Ski means so much to us all. It's not only a testament to the work we've put in, but also to the belief that British skiing belongs at the top.\"\n\nThe British cross country team for the 2026 Winter Olympics is expected to be announced on 23 January.\n\nMeanwhile, Great Britain narrowly missed out on a first World Cup podium of the season in the men's four-man bobsleigh, finishing fourth in Winterberg, Germany.",

    "description": "The Giants wrap up their 2025 season Sunday.",
    "fullText": "The Giants finish yet another miserable season Sunday, when they host the Cowboys.\n\nSo which Giants players — including injured guys who won’t play Sunday — will not return to the team in 2026?\n\nLet’s take a look at the players who definitely will be gone and those who are on the fence, as general manager Joe Schoen (who has overseen so much losing) is somehow trending toward returning.\n\nCUT CANDIDATES WHO LIKELY WON’T RETURN\n\nRB Devin Singletary, K Graham Gano, OT James Hudson, WR Jalin Hyatt\n\nAnalysis: The Giants have their young running back duo for 2026 (Cam Skattebo and Tyrone Tracy). They’d free up $5.25 million in salary cap space by cutting Singletary. Gano is a no-brainer cut ($4.5 million savings). Ditto for Hudson ($5.5 million savings).\n\nHyatt can’t even get on the field. A brutal third-round pick by Schoen. His cap number for 2026 isn’t crazy ($1.7 million), but the Giants would free up $1.5 million of that by releasing him. Why bother retaining him?\n\nMLB Bobby Okereke, LG Jon Runyan\n\nAnalysis: The main issue here is that the Giants would need to find quality replacement starters. The four guys in that first group are much more expendable. But releasing Okereke and Runyan is tempting if only because of the cap savings — $9 million and $9.25 million, respectively.\n\nPENDING FREE AGENTS WHO LIKELY WON’T RETURN\n\nQB Russell Wilson, OL Evan Neal, DT Rakeem Nunez-Roches, RG Greg Van Roten, OL Josh Ezeudu\n\nAnalysis: The Wilson signing failed spectacularly. (Expect him to retire.) Ditto for Schoen drafting Neal (seventh overall) and Ezeudu (third round) in 2022. Two more wasted picks. Nunez-Roches, who turns 33 in July, can no longer stop the run. Van Roten is solid but not spectacular ­— and about to turn 36. The Giants need a younger right guard.\n\nPENDING FREE AGENTS ON THE FENCE\n\nRT Jermaine Eluemunor, WR Wan’Dale Robinson, TE Chris Manhertz, LS Casey Kreiter, CB Cor’Dale Flott, WR Gunner Olszewski, TE Daniel Bellinger, S Dane Belton, ILB Micah McFadden, DT D.J. Davidson\n\nAnalysis: Robinson and Flott are the Giants’ top in-house free agents, and Schoen should work hard to re-sign both. Robinson gives the Giants a slippery presence in the slot, while Flott blossomed into a very good outside corner in 2025. Both would be significant losses if they depart.\n\nEluemunor is a bit trickier, since he is 31. But he pass-blocked well while playing on a two-year contract from 2024-25. You could make a legit case for bringing him back with a short-term commitment.\n\nThe other guys here are lower-profile players.\n\nBellinger lost his starting job to Theo Johnson in 2024, so he probably doesn’t even want to come back. Manhertz is a solid veteran presence. He is worth keeping as a backup, especially since he won’t be expensive. Kreiter will provide special teams consistency with Gano out the door.\n\nOlszewski is an OK returner, but not great. Belton has turned into a strong special teams player, though he isn’t starter material on defense. The Giants could easily move on from Davidson, who is inconsistent. McFadden was trending upward, but he got hurt in Week 1 and missed the season.\n\nCowboys vs. Giants free live stream: How to watch NFL game online (1/4/26)\n\nWhere to watch Cowboys vs. Giants free live stream today (1/4/26) without Streameast\n\nHow to watch NFL RedZone online without cable for Week 18 (1/4/26) | Free trials, live stream, cost\n\nGiants-Cowboys weather: Ice, wind and injuries loom over showdown at MetLife Stadium",

    "description": "Jaylen Raynor leaves for Iowa State after 3 years as Arkansas State’s starter. Red Wolves restock with Drew Dickey.",
    "fullText": "Arkansas State’s three-year starting quarterback will play his final season of college football elsewhere.\n\nJaylen Raynor transferred to Iowa State, as first reported by ESPN’s Pete Thamel. Raynor joins an Iowa State program undergoing its first head coaching change in a decade. With Matt Campbell off to Penn State, Raynor joins a Cyclone squad fronted by head coach Jimmy Rogers, who was hired in December after a year at Washington State. Raynor also follows his offensive coordinator Keith Heckendorf. Heckendorf served as the OC at Arkansas State from 2019-25 and recently accepted a position of quarterbacks coach at Iowa State.\n\nRaynor spent three years as a starter at Iowa State, producing the following stats:\n\n2023: 166/285 (58.2%), 2,550 pass yards, 17 pass TD, 7 INT, 373 rush yards, 5 rush TD\n\n2024: 259/420 (61.7%), 2,783 pass yards, 16 pass TD, 10 INT, 387 rush yards, 3 rush TD\n\n2025: 333/501 (66.5%), 3,361 pass yards, 19 pass TD, 11 INT, 423 rush yards, 7 rush TD\n\nRaynor attained career-highs in passing yards, rushing yards, and touchdowns in each facet in his most recent 2025 season. The quarterback guided the Red Wolves to three-straight bowl appearances and won two, prevailing in the 2024 68 Ventures Bowl over Bowling Green and the 2025 Xbox Bowl over Missouri State.\n\nRaynor is 20-16 as a starter and leaves Arkansas State as the school’s third-leading passer at 8,694 yards — only trailing Ryan Aplin (10,758 yards from 2009-12) and Justice Hansen (10,133 yards from 2016-18). He is ranked fourth in passing touchdowns, third in completions, 24th in rushing yards, and 16th in rushing touchdowns.\n\nThe new Iowa State quarterback possesses familiarity with his new program. Raynor started two games against Iowa State. In 2024 in Ames, the Cyclones had his Red Wolves’ number in a 52-7 shellacking. But in 2025, Arkansas State came excruciatingly close to the upset in Jonesboro, AR. Raynor fired for 222 yards and rushed for a season-high 83 in a 24-16 defeat.\n\nArkansas State already landed a potential Raynor replacement in Drew Dickey. Dickey arrives from Vanderbilt, where he backed up Heisman finalist Diego Pavia. He has two collegiate passes and one completion for 28 yards, and perhaps Jonesboro is where he finally gets an opportunity to flourish in his final year of eligibility.",

And nobody’s done a better job, in my opinion, than Mike Vrabel.”\n\nVrabel enters Week 18 as the betting favorite to win AP NFL Coach of the Year (-190), per FanDuel Sportsbook.

    "description": "Sam Darnold stood up to the old narratives about himself and proved to be a winner this NFL season. Now come the playoffs, and a chance to be great",
    "fullText": "The NFC now runs through the Seattle Seahawks, and a former USC Trojan quarterback led his team to an NFC West title and a first-round bye in the playoffs. Sam Darnold faced the same scenario last season as his Minnesota Vikings took on the Detroit Lions with the same stakes. Just like many other big games Sam Darnold has played in, he came up short last year, and he was a big reason for the loss versus the Lions. This time around, that was not the case.\n\nAs the starter for the Vikings, Sam Darnold in Week 18 last year had a statline of 18/41 for 166 yards through the air and no touchdowns or interceptions. Darnold was sacked two times, and the Detroit Lions made Darnold, who was an MVP candidate that season, look like a rookie. Against the 49ers Saturday night, Darnold still did not look like an MVP, but he did not have to. All that was asked of him was to take care of the football and play better than Brock Purdy. He did just that.\n\nDarnold was not the reason the Seahawks lost this game. He was still 20/26 and threw 198 yards passing. Darnold, in the moments he needed to deliver, he did, and it was always to his best target, Jaxon Smith-Njigba. This was not his best game by any means, but Darnold still stepped up and added another big game victory to his resume. He is killing old narratives that he can not win big games, as he proved that with his last two victories against division opponents.\n\nNobody expected this team to run away with this tough division and be in first place in the NFC. The Seahawks did that because they finally have their franchise quarterback and everything else this team needs to win. Darnold did not finish the season as an MVP candidate finalist, even though he was a name drawing consideration early in the season. He still finishes the year with 4,048 yards passing, 25 touchdowns, and a 67.7 completion percentage. Darnold was everything the Seahawks needed him to be this year.\n\nThe Seahawks look every bit like a Super Bowl contender and should be the favorite to come out of the NFC. The Seahawks defense stopped the hottest offense in the NFL to just 3 points, a week after they put up 42 points. The run game for Seattle was unstoppable, as Kenneth Walker ran for 97 yards and Zach Charbonnet ran for 74 yards and a touchdown. Sam Darnold was a game manager, but he has given this team confidence that when he needs to be elite, he can do that.\n\nThe NFC now runs through the 12th man, and no team in the NFC is looking forward to dealing with the Seahawks come playoff time. There are no longer any weaknesses on this team, and the days of betting on Sam Darnold to disappear in a clutch game are now over. If Sam Darnold plays just like he did last night, the Seahawks could very well win the Super Bowl.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Trojans Wire: Sam Darnold wins another big game as Seahawks stand atop NFC",

    "description": "Are the Phillies exploring other options to bringing back the veteran catcher?",
    "fullText": "When the offseason began, it seemed that it was a given that J.T. Realmuto would return to the Phillies. While he was a free agent able to sign with any team he chose, it seemed like he wanted to return to Philadelphia, and the Phillies wanted him back.\n\nBut we’ve reached January, and Realmuto has yet to re-sign. And then, a few days ago, there were rumors that the Phillies were interested in free agent infielder Bo Bichette. According to Scott Lauber, if the Phillies signed Bichette, there wouldn’t be room in the budget for Realmuto, and they’d have to seek other options at catcher.\n\nIf the #Phillies & JT Realmuto aren’t able to come to an agreement, @PhillyInquirer Scott Lauber (@ScottLauber) says the following could be options.\n\nLauber says a #Phillies reunion with JT Realmuto is still the likeliest scenario. pic.twitter.com/rZ8DJlGZlM\n\n— Alex Coll (@Alexcoll_) January 3, 2026\n\nBichette would be a sizable upgrade over Alec Bohm at third base. The two-time All-Star will be 28 next season and is coming off a year where he had an .840 OPS. His right-handed bat would fit nicely in the top of the Phillies’ order with Trea Turner, Bryce Harper, and Kyle Schwarber.\n\nThe question is: How much of a downgrade would the Realmuto replacements be at catcher?\n\nIt isn’t clear how good Realmuto himself will be over the next few seasons. Realmuto is still good defensively – although not as good as in his Gold Glove-winning prime – but offensively, he’s steadily progressed from “good hitter” to “good hitter for a catcher” to “good enough hitter for a good defensive catcher.” (.700 OPS with 12 home runs in 2025.) At age 35, with a lot of innings under his belt, it’s hard to see that trend reversing significantly.\n\nPart of the reason it seemed like Realmuto was destined to return was because there was a dearth of options to replace him. Rafael Marchan hasn’t shown he can stay healthy for a full season and hit poorly in his 118 plate appearances last season. The best free agent option appears to Victor Caratini, who is a solid hitter, but entering his age 32 season, has only played more than 100 games in a season twice. (One of those coming last year.) It’s possible that a tandem of Caratini and Marchan could be viable, but certainly not a given.\n\nPivot off of Jt Realmuto, go sign Victor Caratini for much less…\n\nCaratini in 2025:\n.259/.324/.404 (.728 OPS)\n12 HRs\n46 RBIs\n105 wRC+\n0.8 fWAR\n\nRealmuto in 2025:\n.257/.315/.384 (.700 OPS)\n12 HRs\n52 RBIs\n94 wRC+\n2.1 fWAR\n\nAre you in on Victor Caratini?#RingTheBell pic.twitter.com/OhYywhlvP1\n\n— SleeperPhillies (@SleeperPhillies) December 28, 2025\n\nAs far as trades go, Adley Rutschman is the biggest name thought to be available, but there are questions with him as well. His offensive numbers have taken a severe downturn the past two years, and he was downright bad at the plate for much of 2025.\n\nTrade Target Review:\n\nOrioles C Adley Rutschman\n\n2025 Stats (90 Games):\n.220/.307/.366 (.673 OPS)\n1.9 WAR\n92 wRC+\n.334 xwOBA\n9 HRs\n29 RBIs#RingTheBell pic.twitter.com/4sNIu27TQt\n\n— SleeperPhillies (@SleeperPhillies) November 14, 2025\n\nAdditionally, the Phillies might not have the trade capital to get him. If they signed Bichette, they’d be theoretically more willing to trade prospect Aidan Miller, but the Orioles appear pretty set in the infield at the moment and might not value Miller that highly. And Andrew Painter would be a high price to pay for a player coming off a poor season.\n\nWhile this is all fun to discuss, I think this is largely just a case of agents and teams trying to improve their positions via the media. Bichette’s agent wants teams to think that the Phillies are interested to put more pressure on his other more likely suitors. And the Phillies are happy to play into it, to put more pressure on Realmuto to just re-sign with them already before they pivot to other options.\n\nIn the end, I’d say the most likely scenario is that Bichette signs elsewhere, and the Phillies and Realmuto compromise on a two-to-three-year contract. But until that actually happens, expect to read more speculation from media members about the Phillies’ potential alternative plans.",

    "fullText": "NFL coaches fired in 2026: Latest news on Mike Tomlin, John Harbaugh, others on Black Monday hot seat originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFourteen NFL teams are looking ahead to the playoffs, but for everyone else, it’s on to the offseason.\n\nBefore free agency and the draft take center stage, the coaching carousel will be the first to heat up. Just don’t expect it to be quite as busy as it was in 2024 or 2025.\n\nWhile the Tennessee Titans and New York Giants both made midseason coaching changes, the combination of back-to-back active cycles over the previous two years and late-season surges from a few teams with coaches on the hot seat could leave this January quieter than normal on the coaching front.\n\nThat doesn’t mean nothing will happen, though. Some coaches’ statuses remained up in the air in Week 18, and it wouldn’t be the NFL offseason without a surprise.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about every coach who might be on the hot seat.\n\nMORE:2025 Fantasy Football Awards\n\nThe Giants fired coach Brian Daboll on Nov. 10, after blowing yet another lead in a loss to the Chicago Bears a day earlier. New York gained momentum after benching Russell Wilson for Jaxson Dart in September, even knocking off the Eagles in a prime-time slot, but the Giants had a penchant for blowing leads this season, including a 19-point meltdown against the Denver Broncos. Daboll went 20-40-1 over less than four seasons in New York.\n\nAfter a dismal 1-5 start with their offense among the worst in the NFL, the Titans fired coach Brian Callahan in the middle of his second season. Tennessee resisted making Callahan a one-and-done coach in 2024, bringing him back after a 3-14 season and giving him the chance to develop No. 1 overall pick Cam Ward, but the Titans showed little improvement over the first six games of the season before Mike McCoy replaced Callahan on an interim basis. Callahan went 4-19 over 23 games in Nashville.\n\nMORE:NFL playoffs QB confidence meter\n\nLas Vegas Raiders coach Pete Carroll is at risk of going one-and-done in Las Vegas, according to multiple reports.“We’ll see if Pete Carroll is there for it. I doubt it, but we’ll see,” NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport said while discussing the Raiders’ outlook for the 2026 draft, reiterating other reports that claim the organization might want to clean house as a disastrous season comes to a close.\n\nHeading into Week 18, signs are pointing to the Pete Caroll era being one-and-done in Las Vegas. Insiders including CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones and NFL Network's Ian Rapoport believe that the Raiders are heading for a reset. Las Vegas welcomes in the defending AFC champions Kansas City Chiefs in Week 18.\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter leans towards the Raiders moving on from Caroll after jsut one season. Schefter is calling it a failed \"experiment,\" and believes the Raiders will eat the final two years on his contract.\n\nFox's Jay Glazer also believes that Caroll will be out after one season as the Raiders' head coach.\n\nIf the Raiders make a change, they would be searching for their 13th full-time head coach in the last 25 years.\n\nThe future of Cleveland Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski has been the subject of much speculation, but reports haven't clarified whether he is more likely to stay or go. The two-time Coach of the Year suffered through an ugly 2024 season and likewise didn't come close to contending in 2025, though the Browns entered the year with low expectations and no clear answer at quarterback. Stefanski is hoping a gritty Week 17 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers will be enough to buy him a seventh season in Cleveland.\n\nAccording to CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones, Cleveland and Stefanski appear to be headed for a split. Jones details that \"At 43, Stefanski remains a young coach who is well thought of across the league, and few would be surprised if he winds up getting another head-coaching gig this cycle.\"\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter believes Stefanski will not be back to coach the Browns next season. Schefter also claims that Stefanski will be a highly sought-after coach with all the openings.\n\nMORE: The NFL's highest paid coaches in 2025\n\nAfter a four-win improvement in 2024, the hope was the Arizona Cardinals would make a playoff leap in 2025. Instead, they completely unraveled after a 2-0 start, losing 13 of their next 14 games and suffering five losses by margins of 20 points or more from November onward. While the Cardinals' major change could be moving on from Kyler Murray, which seems like a near certainty, it might be hard for Arizona to justify Gannon returning for a fourth season.\n\nThough, some believe that Gannon will return to Arizona in 2026. NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported that the general sense around Arizona is Gannon will be the head coach next season, \"this time with a QB that he’s involved in selecting along with GM Monti Ossenfort.\" However, owner Michael Bidwell hasn't made a firm decision yet.\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter says that the feeling around the league is that Gannon will remain safe for next season. There is a strong belief that the Cardinals are moving on from Kyler Murray, and therefore, the owners want to give Gannon a chance to find his own quarterback.\n\nSteelers coach Mike Tomlin has still never had a losing season in nearly two decades in Pittsburgh, but the 2025 is shaping up to look much like 2024, whether they win the division or not. The Steelers have faded after an early hot start and taken a couple of surprise losses, including their Week 17 defeat at the hands of the Browns when they had a chance to clinch the AFC North. If the Steelers don't win the division, it will mean they finish one game worse than they did in 2024, before adding Aaron Rodgers, DK Metcalf, Jalen Ramsey and more. That doesn't necessarily mean the Steelers would fire Tomlin, but it could open the door for a mutual parting of ways, depending on what Tomlin is thinking.\n\nA report by Albert Breer suggested the Steelers already know who they would turn to if they part ways with Tomlin. Rams DC Chris Shula, grandson of Don Shula, would be the frontrunner for the job.\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter reports there is a feeling that Tomlin will be back, at least to finish his contract. Conversations will still be had, but he's leaning towards being safe.\n\nFox's Jay Glazer believes that if Tomlin is not the coach for the Steelers next season, it would be his own doing. He does not think the Steelers would fire Tomlin.\n\nOn the other side of the Steelers-Ravens rivalry is John Harbaugh, who has done battle with Tomlin for 18 years. Even with Lamar Jackson's injuries playing a major role, the Ravens have to be disappointed with how the season has played out. Baltimore entered Week 17 under .500 and on the verge of elimination, though an AFC North title remains in play. After so much success with Jackson healthy in 2023 and 2024, the Ravens' likeliest path is to just try to reshape the roster as best they can for 2026, but Harbaugh's job status could come into question if frustration mounts.\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter leans safe with Harbaugh, but thinks there should be more focus on this situation than on Tomlin's.\n\nAfter a 2-7 start to the season, Mike McDaniel and the Miami Dolphins have turned the season around, going 5-2 over the seven games leading into Week 18. That might've help save McDaniel's job, as McDaniel needed a strong finish to prove why he should remain in the role.\n\nThe Dolphins will be looking for a new general manager in the offseason after firing Chris Grier, so it's possible that hire will help decide McDaniel's fate. However, NFL Network reports that McDaniel will likely return for a fifth season.\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter is also leaning towards McDaniel being safe for the time being.\n\nAdam Schefter on ESPN:\n\n“The feeling of owners right now is (the Dolphins) prefer to keep (Mike McDaniel). It doesn’t mean that he’s going to be safe. But we are leaning safe today. If they were making a decision today (he) is back. But there will be conversations in the…\n\n— Joe Schad (@schadjoe) January 4, 2026\n\nThe Atlanta Falcons seemed to he headed toward a change after spiraling to 4-9 despite entering the season with realistic playoff hopes. Are three consecutive wins enough to save Raheem Morris' job? On one hand, the Falcons have proven Morris has kept the team focused and playing hard even after being eliminated. On the other hand, the late-season run is a reminder of what could have been in a winnable NFC South and raises questions about why Morris couldn't get results against divisional opponents.\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter leans safe, believing Morris saved his job given how the Falcons have finished the season.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers' late-season collapse has led some to wonder whether coach Todd Bowles could be on the hot seat. According to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, he isn't likely to be fired. \"They've won three-straight division titles and still have a possibility of winning their fourth. Does that sound like someone who should be in trouble? I'd say certainly not,\" Rapoport said. If the Buccaneers miss the playoffs, though, it might be hard for the organization to ignore questions about the fourth-year coach's status.\n\nThough, with the Buccaneers extending Bowles in the offseason, CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones reported that it seems unlikely Tampa Bay fires the head coach, who has a 34-33 record entering a must-win Week 18 contest against the Carolina Panthers.\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter reports that the Buccaneers do not want to make a coaching change, and the belief is that Bowles is safe.\n\nIt's easy to blame Joe Burrow's injury for the Cincinnati Bengals' failures in 2025, but the team still lost winnable games with and without their star losing to the New York Jets without Burrow and getting shut out by the Ravens with him. Still, reports indicate that isn't likely to cost Zac Taylor his job, and back-to-back blowout wins leading into Week 18 indicate the typically loyal Bengals will stick with their head coach for a seventh season with hopes Burrow can stay healthy in 2026.\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter says that quarterback Joe Burrow is a believer in Taylor and that the Bengals are not expected to move on.\n\nMORE: Revisiting Aaron Glenn’s playing career\n\nOne-and-done head coaches have become a bit more common in the NFL over the past decade, so speculation about Aaron Glenn's job status has bubbled up among fans as the New York Jets have limped to the finish line. While New York doesn't have much talent on the field with Garrett Wilson and two quarterbacks injured plus two core defensive pieces traded away, tangible progress has been hard to find for Gang Green. That still isn't expected to cost Glenn his job. Fox Sports' Jay Glazer declared, \"he'll be safe,\" when discussing Glenn's status in Week 17, and owner Woody Johnson, for all his flaws, isn't known to be too volatile with coaches.\n\nNFL Network's Ian Rapoport believes the same when it comes to Glenn, saying \"the Jets are bringing back Aaron Glenn for a second season as head coach. The question is, how significant will changes be to his staff?\"\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter shares this same belief and reports that the Jets are committed to Glenn despite the struggles.\n\nFox's Jay Glazer firmly claims that Glenn is safe for next season.\n\nIt might seem surprising to see an accomplished and respected head coach such as Sean McDermott in the conversation of potential firings. However, despite the regular-season success and a good record in Buffalo, playoff success ultimately threatens McDermott's future.\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter labels McDermott as safe, but if Buffalo loses in the playoffs, the belief is that conversations would be had about potentially firing McDermott.\n\nIt's been a drastic turn of events for everyone in Indianapolis. After a successful start this season, the Colts were considered potential Super Bowl contenders. However, this was before losing Daniel Jones to a season-ending injury. Since Jones went down in Week 14, the Colts have not won a game.\n\nWhile ESPN's Adam Schefter says Steichen is leaning toward being safe, he also claims the Colts' owners have not spoken on it.\n\nWhile there are no major rumors of Matt LaFleur getting fired, his job security continues to be questioned weekly. Depending on how the season ends for the Packers, it will provide a clearer picture of LaFleur's future.\n\nFox's Jay Glazer places Lafleur in the \"time will tell\" category and believes it would be crazy for the Packers to move on.",

    "description": "The 49ers are likely to face either the Eagles or the Bears next week.",
    "fullText": "The San Francisco 49ers will find out who their Wild Card opponent will be next week before Sunday night football kicks off.\n\nOne of their potential matchups, the Philadelphia Eagles, will rest several starters on Sunday. Jalen Hurts, Saquon Barkley, A.J. Brown, DeVonta Smith, and the entire starting offensive line are not listed among the first team depth chart. Defensively, the same is true. The Eagles are punting a chance at a home game in the Divisional round in exchange for a week of health.\n\nPhiladelphia also seems comfortable with the idea of playing the 49ers next week as opposed to the Packers. Philly narrowly escaped Green Bay earlier this year in a 10-7 victory.\n\nLet’s act as if the Eagles lose. Regardless of what happens the rest of Week 17, they are the sixth seed—assuming the Rams don’t slip up against the Cardinals Sunday afternoon.\n\nDan Campbell plans to play his starters, even the banged-up ones. That offense is still lethal. Way back in Week 2, the Lions beat the Bears 52-21. Of course, these are much different teams since then, but it wouldn’t be surprising to see Detroit pull off a mild upset against the Bears.\n\nLet’s pretend Tanner McKee turns into Randall Cunningham today and the Eagles beat Washington. That result, paired with a Lions win, means the 49ers would travel to Soldier Field and face a Bears team that will have revenge on its mind.\n\nWhich team would you rather face?\n\nFacing a team twice in three weeks and expecting a win is a tall task. Chicago didn’t present much of a challenge defensively for the 49ers, but the margin for error against Caleb Williams and that offense is slim to none.\n\nThe Eagles are an elite defensive team and are the closest thing to the Seahawks’ defense in the NFC. We saw how that went for the 49ers on Saturday night. Philly is wildly inconsistent on offense, but getting stops is an issue for Robert Saleh’s unit.\n\nThis is all under the assumption that the Rams win and the 49ers won’t face the NFC South winner.",

    "fullText": "Arne Slot spoke to Sky Sports after Liverpool's draw against Fulham: \"In an away game, scoring two goals should maybe be enough to win the game. It's not for the first time this season that we fight so hard and think we have a win but concede an incredible strike. We brought Joe Gomez in but they took it short. We missed out on a good result.\n\n\"We had our chances in the first half. We had a similar one with Cody Gakpo that they scored from. In an ideal world, we see a Liverpool team that is dominant but creates more chances. We scored two goals, scored two disallowed goals and hit the bar. Again, it wasn't enough.\n\n\"The players are giving everything they have. I have to keep in mind that I have to keep them available. Alexander Isak is out and I have to overload or play Hugo more, a player who has never played in the Premier League. You have to manage that. We still have 11 very good players on the pitch.\n\n\"It's not only for us, but many teams don't create chances every game. It's not perfect but at least we've created a few more chances today than last week.\"\n\nCody Gakpo spoke to BBC Match of the Day: \"It's disappointing for us. We fought very hard in the second half, dominated at moments and tried to create chances to get through. At the end I scored in minute 95, they scored in minute 97 - a wonderful goal to be fair. Unlucky, unfortunate.\n\n\"This is a moment that can happen in a game. I was just sitting down so I did not see the moments before. I just saw him take a touch and shoot the ball into the top corner.\n\n\"I think if you are going to analyse the game maybe we should have scored more goals or defended the two goals better. In the end we should do much better. There were moments that we showed how good we were but it is up to us to stay consistent and put in overall better performances. I'm sure the wins will come again.\"\n\nOn playing in the nine: \"As a forward player you always want to score goals to help the team so it's a plus for me. In the end it's a team sport and we didn't win so I'm still disappointed.\"",

It was a brilliant finish.\"\n\nOn Smith, Parkinson said: \"I thought at Blackburn he was really good. He did everything you'd want from a striker. He ran in behind, he held it up and he got his goal.\n\n\"Today, again, against good players, you're up against three really good Championship defenders, he's had a brilliant chance earlier, but then he got his goal.\n\n\"It's just his all-round play and the way he fought for the team was just brilliant.\"\n\nVictory against John Eustace's side lifted Wrexham to within a point of the Championship's play-off places.\n\nAnd while eager not to get carried away with his side's recent run, Parkinson says Wrexham are undoubtedly better placed to finish in the top six this season as a result of their current winning streak.\n\n\"We've certainly put ourselves in a stronger position after the Christmas period,\" he said.\n\n\"It's four out of four over Christmas and I'm so pleased for our supporters because that support we had today was amazing.\n\n\"When you look at the costs over the Christmas period, for the supporters to come out in their numbers today was brilliant and I'm so pleased we sent them back happy.\"",

Tyson Fury has announced he’s leaving retirement and will fight again in 2026.\n\nThat’s not much of a shock considering the number of times Fury has tried and failed to stay retired, and this latest retirement ended after months of reports out of Saudi Arabia that “The Gypsy King” was in negotiations for at least two more fights. But now we have Tyson himself proclaiming his return.\n\n“2026 is that year, return of the Mac,” Fury wrote on an Instagram post. “Been away for a while but I’m back now, 37 years old and still punching. Nothing better to do than punch men in the face & get paid for it!”\n\n‼️ Tyson Fury takes to social media to confirm his return in 2026 👀 pic.twitter.com/INzMKIjJ2a\n\n— Ring Magazine (@ringmagazine) January 4, 2026\n\nThis follows up on a big report from mid-December that revealed Saudi boxing power broker Turki Alalshikh had signed Tyson Fury vs. Anthony Joshua to compete at Riyadh Season 2026, which kicks off in October. A warm-up fight is also expected sometime in the next four to five months.\n\nPrior to Fury’s announcement, footage was released of Tyson Fury getting some training done in Thailand. While the former heavyweight champion’s retirement belly flopped about like a bag of milk thrown down a garbage chute, it’s clear he still has the skills to bounce right back into top contention.\n\nNow the only question mark that remains is Anthony Joshua’s continued participation in the original plan. Joshua was in a horrible car accident just one week ago that left two of his friends dead, and it’s unclear whether he’s physically and mentally willing to move forward with one of the most important fights of his career.\n\nHe certainly doesn’t need the money. Even after U.K. and U.S. taxmen took him for tens of millions of dollars, he still walked away from a December fight with Jake Paul over $40 million dollars richer.",

    "description": "The oldest active wrestler is Big Japan Pro-Wrestling co-founder Great Kojika, who is currently in his 80s.",
    "fullText": "Professional wrestling is known to be exceptionally taxing on the body, making it all the more impressive when a performer is able to continue in the industry at an advanced age. North Americans like Mike Jackson and Chick Donovan are known as some of the oldest wrestlers who are still active, but there is one who has surpassed them: the Great Kojika.\n\nBorn in Japan in 1942, Shinya Koshika is 83 years old and, as of today, wrestled his most recent match in April 2025. Though he took a few years off, Kojika has been an active performer since 1963. He's known to be the final active wrestler who trained under Rikidōzan, one of the most monumental figures in pro wrestling history.\n\nMany familiar with him would likely agree that Koshika's most iconic work was done in All Japan Pro-Wrestling, where he performed from 1973 through 1986, when he initially decided to retire. However, he was coaxed out of that retirement in 1995, and would eventually make his return to AJPW among other ventures.\n\nKojika's career wasn't just limited to Japan, either. From the 1960s into the '70s, Kojika wrestled for the NWA in the United States, sometimes performing as the unfortunately-named Mr. Kung-Fu, or Kung Fu Lee. Kojika's stateside opponents include Dory Funk Jr., Fritz von Erich, Bob Backlund, and Stan Hansen, among many others.\n\nIn 1973, he captured the NWA Western States Heavyweight Championship for a time before dropping it to the legendary Terry Funk. Other titles held by Kojika over the years include the All Asia Tag Team Championship in AJPW, and the NWA Americas Heavyweight Championship, plus numerous other tag and trio titles in Japan.\n\nIn the 1990s, after deciding to come out of in-ring retirement, Koshika also helped found Big Japan Pro Wrestling. The promotion remains active to this day, with Koshika as its President. Though he doesn't wrestle often, Kojika still gets in the ring from time to time, and he has yet to officially indicate his retirement.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "title": "Valter Walker reveals secret behind his heel hook submission: ‘I don’t go for my opponent to tap’",
    "description": "Valter Walker has pulled off four consecutive heel hook submissions in the UFC.",
    "fullText": "Valter Walker made history after snatching his fourth consecutive heel hook submission in the UFC back in October following a win over Louie Sutherland.\n\nWhile heel hooks aren’t necessarily uncommon in the UFC, Walker’s innate ability to somehow always catch the submission is stunning, especially with opponents knowing that’s become one of his go to moves. But how exactly is Walker constantly catching this one particularly difficult submission?\n\nIt turns out, the Brazilian credits his willingness to go for the kill as the real catalyst.\n\n“The secret of the heel hook, I’ll tell you now — I see many guys in the UFC try to do the heel hook and it don’t work. Why?” Walker told MMA Fighting. “Because they take the heel hook, first they don’t believe this is going to work and second, they [want] their opponent to tap. When I go for the heel hook, I go for broke. I don’t go for my opponent to tap.”\n\nIt’s that “go for broke” attitude that Walker believes separates his heel hook submission from so many others.\n\nObviously, Walker isn’t rooting for anyone to suffer serious harm in a fight but the reality is his opponents are trying to knock him out or potentially break a limb applying a submission so he’s just returning the favor.\n\n“If you see my face, every time when I take the heel hook, my face, I’m doing a lot of power,” Walker said. “Because I’m trying to break his leg. Because if my opponent doesn’t tap, the leg is going to break. Every time, when I [grab the heel hook], I feel the knee crack and the foot crack. The last four fights, I feel everybody’s foot crack. Because I go for broke. This is the secret.\n\n“I don’t think about making you tap. I think about breaking your leg. My coach tells me all the time, don’t go for tap, go for broke. In the gym, go for tap. All the time when I’m in the gym, I go for the tap, they defend. In the gym, I go for a tap, they start to defend. In the fight, I do it and you see how it works.”\n\nHeel hooks are sometimes banned in certain grappling competitions because when applied properly, the submission can do a lot of damage to the knee in rapid-fire fashion.\n\nIn MMA, heel hooks aren’t seen quite as often because the attacking fighter usually has to give up a position to go for the submission and many times an opponent can defend by simply slipping free due to sweat making it harder to grab onto the leg.\n\nFor Walker, he just sees the opening and when he snatches his heel hook, there’s no going back, although he always hopes both he and his opponent can walk away from the fight.\n\n“You can tap or scream,” Walker said. “I wait for the referee to stop it but the last time, I feel like I broke his leg. The last two times, I feel it could break but I feel like I don’t need to do that. I go for broke and when I feel his leg crack, I already [stop a little bit] because when it cracks, you cannot kick anymore and it’s going to break.\n\n“I don’t need break this guy’s career for six months or maybe one year. I just put my mind on I go for broke.”\n\nWhile the heel hook has become Walker’s calling card lately, he actually wasn’t as proficient in that submission when he first got to the UFC.\n\nIt’s a move that he knew how to execute but after he tapped out Junior Tafa with a heel hook back in 2024, he realized it could be a very effective weapon for him.\n\n“If I tell you the truth, before I don’t train a lot [with this submission],” Walker said. “I don’t try but after my first victory with a heel hook, I started getting better. In the gym before, I know how to do heel hooks. When some Dagestani guy [takes me down] and cannot stand up, I do the heel hook. I know how to do the heel hook better on the ground when I’m under you. This is better. From the top, I don’t do very good. I did in my last four fights from the top but I do more better from the under position. I usually only do the heel hook in the gym when somebody [takes me down] and cannot stand up. I do the heel hook to [submit] him, hit that and we stand up or he tries to defend and it opens the window for me to stand up.\n\n“When I get my first victory from a heel hook, I start believing more on this. Everyday in the gym when I have wrestling training, I try to do in the sparring two or three times. Then every time we have sparring and training, I try to do to my sparring partners two or three times. All the time I shoot from everywhere for the heel hook. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t work but I feel I’m getting better. It started working very easy. In the training, I can do this one from everywhere.”\n\nAs good as he’s gotten with the heel hook, Walker promises he’s got plenty \n\nThat alone provides Walker with a potential edge in any fight and could eventually lead to even more devastating finishes in the future.\n\n“Guys say ‘how is it possible?’ I don’t know, I just see,” Walker said. “It’s like people don’t see but I see and I feel. People say I don’t see how? I say I don’t understand how, too, I just see the window and I go inside. I just feel it. Maybe this is my way.\n\n“I keep training everything. I don’t only train heel hooks but I think people only know how to do heel hooks.”",

    "title": "The year 2026 could be a “prove it” one for UNC’s teams",
    "description": "We could know a whole lot more about several UNC programs in 12 months’ time.",
    "fullText": "Every year when the clock strikes midnight on December 31st and we enter January 1st and the new year, there is often time for reflection on what happened in the previous 365 days. However, it’s also a time to look forward and lay out your hopes and dreams for the 365 days to come.\n\nThe year 2026 has a chance to be a very good one for North Carolina Tar Heels’ athletics. You can probably list the Olympic/non-revenue sports that usually have contending teams and could very well again this year. Even in the bigger revenue sports, we could see some good stuff going forward, but a theme for all of them is that they have something to prove.\n\nThe first part of the 2025-26 men’s basketball season couldn’t have gone much better for UNC. The Tar Heels lost just once in non-conference play, to what appears to be an also-very-good Michigan State team. Beyond that, they have wins over Kansas, Kentucky, which beyond just blue blood bragging rights, could end up being marquee ones on an NCAA Tournament résumé. They’ve generally handled business in an impressive and efficient way [Editor’s note: excepting yesterday’s second half against SMU].\n\nHowever, the program in generally still has a lot to prove in the ACC slate and (hopefully) conference and NCAA Tournaments. In Hubert Davis’ tenure, they’ve only had one truly good season from start to end: 2023-24, when they earned a #1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. Of course there was the championship game run in 2022, but that came on the heels of a regular season that was only good enough to get a #8 seed.\n\nComing into this season, there was a thought that Hubert Davis was on somewhat of a hot seat. Considering this start, it’s hard to imagine things going bad enough from here to cost him his job, but whether it’s a one year reprieve or something more than that remains to be seen. Based on what Carolina has done so far, it seems like proof of concept that Davis can put together a top ten-ish (or who knows, maybe better) roster, but this team still has to prove it. It would feel like a bummer if we’re sitting here on Selection Sunday watching UNC get a #6 seed or worse.\n\nOver in women’s basketball, there’s no real threat of a hot seat for Courtney Banghart. After the program went through a fairly extended slump in the years before her hire, she has the Tar Heels as a fairly consistent top 15-20 program, making it to the second weekend of the NCAA Tournament, and regularly landing highly rated recruits.\n\nHowever, at least so far, they haven’t been able to truly get on the level of the sport’s dominant powers. They’ve played South Carolina close a couple times, but games against the Gamecocks, UConn, and this season against UCLA and Texas haven’t gone their way, and have often been double digit losses.\n\nI have faith that Banghart can get the program there, but it sure would be nice for them to take a tangible step forward. Again, it won’t (nor should it) cost her the job if UNC loses in the Sweet 16 or earlier, but going further than that would represent some proof of concept that they’re nearing the elite of women’s basketball.\n\nI think anyone with eyes who was following what happened in 2025 knows what the Tar Heel football program has to prove in 2026. Year one of the grand Bill Belichick experiment led to a 4-8 season and lots of jokes at UNC’s expense. Obviously, there’s a metric ton that Belichick and company have to prove next season.\n\nUnlike the other two though, with football I have some doubts of how much can be proven. The 2025 roster appears to have been a complete miscalculation of player evaluation. General manager Mike Lombardi has said they would focus on recruiting and development in the future. A bit of an issue there is that most true freshman football players aren’t typically ready to play immediately. Therefore, if they actually want to have a good record in 2026, they’re probably going to have to rely on the current roster/transfers again — and unless they decided to go Texas Tech mode and just drop a bunch of bags on the biggest, best, and meanest players in the portal, I’m not sure how much improvement can be made. I wouldn’t complain if I am proven wrong, but they emphatically have to prove it.\n\nWe quite literally have a year to get the answers to many of these questions, so there’s plenty of time to figure it out, but 2026 could be an interesting year for many of the UNC sports programs.",

But despite their best efforts, the Chiefs found themselves eliminated from playoff contention after a midseason collapse.\n\nNow 6-10, Kansas City will have a chance to end its disastrous 2025 campaign on a high note against a bitter rival.\n\nCheck out our staff predictions for the Chiefs' Week 18 matchup against the Raiders:\n\nThe 2025 season officially comes to an end in Week 18 as the Kansas City Chiefs attempt to get back in the win column.\n\nThe offense will primarily focus on Travis Kelce, who could be playing in his final NFL game. Chris Oladokun will produce better results after a full week of practice, as he hopes to raise his stock for next season. The Chiefs' running backs will be closely watched as Dameon Pierce is expected to make his team debut.\n\nThe defense should continue to play well as young players gain experience. The unit has performed well during the late-season losing streak. Every rep is necessary to build for the offseason into the 2026 campaign.\n\nFinal score: Chiefs 13, Raiders 10\n\nKansas City will finally finish its rollercoaster season on Sunday before a long and much-needed offseason break.\n\nFrankly, there's no way to tell how Sunday's game will play out. The Chiefs are down to backups and third-stringers as head coach Andy Reid looks to avoid injuries ahead of the offseason. Quarterback Chris Oladokun was serviceable in last week's loss to the Denver Broncos, but with several offensive stars on Kansas City's injury report in Week 18, a high-scoring game is likely out of the question. Still, expect a big game from tight end Travis Kelce as he potentially takes the field for the final time.\n\nQuarterback Bo Nix tore the Chiefs' defense apart in Week 17, when he threw for 182 yards and a touchdown. It is still unknown who the Raiders will have under center on Sunday, though it will likely be backup quarterback Kenny Pickett. Pickett may not be as threatening as Nix, but the former Pittsburgh Steeler is still good for the occasional legacy game. With no real incentives on the line, Kansas City's defense will most likely fail to stop the veteran backup.\n\nFinal score: Chiefs 21, Raiders 23\n\nKansas City has every incentive to lose this game. Draft position is all that matters at this point, and while a meaningless win would make the Chiefs' disastrous 2025 campaign look a little better on paper, a 6-11 record could help Kansas City maximize the trappings of its failure in April.\n\nDown to their third-string quarterback, the Chiefs would almost certainly be considered underdogs against any other opponent. Only the lowly Raiders could make this Kansas City team look competent.\n\nFinal score: Chiefs 12, Raiders 8\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Chiefs vs. Raiders: 3 predictions for AFC West showdown in Week 18",

    "description": "A primer on one of the Brewers’ recent 40-man roster additions",
    "fullText": "Unless you follow the Brewers’ minor league system, you probably haven’t heard of Coleman Crow. Crow just turned 25 but has been around the minor leagues for six years. He was drafted by the Los Angeles Angels in the 28th round all the way back in 2019, but didn’t play a game of affiliated ball until 2021. Crow earned a promotion to Double-A before the 2022 season and showed signs of promise (9.0 strikeouts per nine innings, 2.5 walks per nine innings) despite an ERA approaching 5 and a 1.41 HR/9 rate. He finished the year ranked as the Angels’ No. 23 prospect.\n\nUnfortunately, any momentum built up over 2022 came to a screeching halt in 2023. Crow tore his UCL in just his fourth start of the season and was placed on the IL. A couple of months later, Los Angeles traded him as part of a deal to acquire New York Mets infielder Eduardo Escobar before the deadline. Crow never pitched for the Mets; just months later, New York traded him to Milwaukee as the return for Adrian Houser and Tyrone Taylor.\n\nCrow didn’t pitch at all in the 2024 season, either. That didn’t stop him from breaking out in a big way in his first year pitching for the Brewers organization. Crow posted career highs in ERA (3.34), K/9 (11.5), and batting average against (.217) through 12 starts between Double-A Biloxi and Triple-A Nashville. By the end of the season, he’d earned his way onto MLB Pipeline’s list of the top 30 Brewers prospects (No. 25). Milwaukee also added him to the 40-man roster in November to keep him from minor league free agency, suggesting they see him as a future contributor in one way or another.\n\nCrow has a couple of attributes that Milwaukee values highly while evaluating prospects — a plus-plus pitch and flat vertical approach angle (VAA).\n\nMLB Pipeline gives Crow an overall scouting grade of 40, but his mid-70s curveball is a 60. The key to his curve is an incredibly high spin rate; his average spin rate (around 3000 rpm) would be one of the best in the major leagues. Crow also regularly gets around 19” of vertical break and five feet (!!) of drop. For context, Cardinals pitcher Phil Maton was the only major leaguer to average 19” of vertical break on his curveball. Truly a plus-plus pitch — when Crow’s on, it looks like he’s throwing a Wiffle ball:\n\nColeman Crow struck out 8 batters in 4.2 innings of scoreless baseball!#ThisIsMyCrew pic.twitter.com/9SVMNAsQKX\n\n— Brewers Player Development (@BrewersPD) May 9, 2025\n\nThe other pitches haven’t developed to the extent that his curveball has (although the bar is certainly high). His fastball sits in the low-90s and has a fairly high spin rate (2600 rpm) itself. Crow also throws a slider, sinker, and changeup. If he’s comfortable throwing even two of those pitches (along with his curveball) at the major league level, he’ll be able to get outs consistently.\n\nThe other main thing the Brewers like about Crow’s profile is his VAA. As I’ve explained in other articles, a flat VAA means that the pitch comes in at a deceptive, flatter-than-average angle, which often causes pitchers to swing under the ball. A lot of Milwaukee’s pitchers have VAAs that are flatter than average, as does Crow.\n\nCrow’s fastball plays best up in the zone, which is dangerous because he doesn’t throw very hard. These two traits, combined with the fact that his VAA already causes hitters to swing under the ball, mean that Crow can be somewhat home run-prone (as he was in 2022).\n\nHowever, since joining the Brewers organization, Crow has shown a lot of growth in limiting the long ball, keeping hitters off balance by mixing speeds and locations. Not only did Crow have the best season of his career last year, but he also recorded the lowest fly ball rate and HR/9 rate (0.54) of his career.\n\nSo, does Crow have a path to contributing this year?\n\nThe short answer is: probably not as things stand right now. Milwaukee has at least seven pitchers on the 40-man roster — Freddy Peralta, Brandon Woodruff, Jacob Misiorowski, Quinn Priester, Chad Patrick, Robert Gasser, and Logan Henderson — who would most likely be given a chance to earn a spot in the rotation before Crow. The Brewers would probably rather use multi-inning guys Aaron Ashby, Tobias Myers, and DL Hall out of the bullpen, but any of those guys could conceivably end up starting a game or two —as could new acquisition Ángel Zerpa. Milwaukee is blessed with considerable starting pitching depth right now, so Crow probably wouldn’t earn a consistent spot in the rotation.\n\nI say that Crow probably doesn’t have a path to contributing this year because injuries happen, as the first two months of last season made readily apparent. Even in this scenario, Milwaukee would probably rather start a guy like Carlos Rodriguez instead of starting Crow after only 10-ish Triple-A starts. Crow missed the last two months of the season with a hip injury and a flexor strain. He only pitched in two Triple-A games (7.71 ERA) before the injury. It makes more sense to let Crow develop in hopes that he can become a legitimate contributor in 2027.\n\nWith that being said, Crow is a lot closer to being a rotation option than some may think. His career season last year wasn’t a fluke — rather, it was a product of learning how to limit home runs and pitch to his strengths. It might not be next year, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see Coleman Crow in a Brewers uniform sometime soon.",

Cleveland played at UGA from 2016-2020 and is known for having an impressive combination of size and strength.\n\nCleveland was recently suspended three games for violating the NFL's substance abuse policy, but had been a healthy scratch for Balti\n\nCleveland was a third-round pick in the 2021 NFL draft. He appeared in 10 games with the Ravens in 2025 and had been with the AFC North franchise since he was drafted. Cleveland and the Ravens made the playoffs several times, but were never able to make the Super Bowl during his time in Baltimore.\n\nThe 6-foot-6, 350-pound offensive lineman appeared in 64 games during his time with Baltimore, but he primarily played as a backup or on special teams. Cleveland will look for a new NFL home. In Feb. 2025, Cleveland was arrested for driving under the influence.\n\nCleveland's combination of size and NFL experience means that he should find a new NFL suitor.

    "fullText": "MADISON – Wisconsin got its quarterback Sunday Jan. 4 and it appears to be an ideal fit.\n\nThe Badgers scored the key piece of their needs from the transfer portal when Colton Joseph, a 6-foot-2, 200-pound two-year starter from Old Dominion committed to the program. He has two years of eligibility left.\n\nThe addition of Joseph gives the Badgers an ideal fit for offensive coordintor Jeff Grimes' offense. And in the scheme of the Badgers quarterbacks room it adds some continuity between the Joseph and the other top returning QBs who are on the roster as of Sunday morning. Redshirt freshman Carter Smith and rising junior Danny O’Neil also fit the dual threat mode.\n\nJoseph was named the Sun Belt offensive player of the year and finished the season with 3,631 yards of total offense and posted 1,000-yard seasons in both rushing and passing. He ranks eighth in FBS with 302.6 total yards per game.\n\nJoseph completed 59.7% of his passes (173 of 290) for 2,624 yards, 21 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. As a runner, he gained, 1,007 yards in 158 carries, a 6.4-yard average, and scored 13 touchdowns.\n\nHe comes to Wisconsin with 21 games of experience and 5,905 yards of total offense.\n\nThe addition of Joseph is part of what has been a big opening weekend for transfer portal additions for the Badgers’ ailing offense.\n\nOn Jan 3, Wisconsin secured a commitment from former Iowa State running back Abu Sama III as well as former Bowling Green tight end Jacob Harris. Sunday former Southern Illinois tight end Ryan Schwendenman signed.\n\nMore: Wisconsin football transfer portal tracker: Veteran joins Badgers backfield\n\nThis article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Former Old Dominion quarterback Colton Joseph commits to Wisconsin",

    "fullText": "Arsenal held on for three points in a 3-2 victory away to Bournemouth this weekend, and by avoiding conceding a late equaliser the Gunners extended their run of matches without letting in three goals to 116 games in all competitions.\n\nOrbinho reports that this is now the best run by any team in the history of English football, now spanning over two years of fixtures.\n\nThe last time Arsenal let three in was against Luton Town all the way back in December 2023.\n\nThere have been a lot of obstacles to overcome along the way. Notably, Arsenal have played 23 matches against big-six teams, three games against Bayern Munich, three against Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain, and two against Real Madrid during that period.\n\nThen add in all the other matches, the domestic cup games where youth players have been given a chance, the six times Arsenal have been reduced to 10 men, the countless defensive injuries. There were a lot of opportunities to end the run in there.\n\nNo one should be under the impression that a top team like Arsenal should be conceding three goals or more on a regular basis. But the expectation is certainly that it will happen at least a few times.\n\nBayern, PSG, and Real Madrid often dominate their respective leagues, they all sit in the Champions League top-eight right now, yet all three have conceded three goals in a game this season already.\n\nThe odds were always stacked against the Gunners going this long without letting in three on a single occasion.\n\nEvery match now will add another game to the record total, and Arsenal will want to keep the run going for as long as possible. It’s obviously a lot easier to pick up wins on a regular basis if you never have to score more than three to achieve one.\n\nThe rest of the month will bring plenty of challenges though, with Liverpool up next, the League Cup semi-final against Chelsea coming up, as well as a trip away to Inter Milan and the visit of Manchester United.\n\nArsenal will need to be on top form at both ends to remain top of the Premier League and competing in all other competitions.",

    "fullText": "Real Madrid were expected to struggle without Kylian Mbappe against Real Betis on Sunday evening, but they made easy work of Los Verdiblancos – much to the surprise of supporters across the globe.\n\nThe quality of the team was never really in question, but there was a sense of concern as to who would score the goals in Mbappe’s absence. Ironically, the men in white scored five goals on the night.\n\nA hat-trick for Gonzalo Garcia and goals for Raul Asencio and Fran Garcia wrapped up a special win for Real Madrid, helping them stay within touching distance of Barcelona and on a good run of momentum.\n\nSpeaking to the media after the game, Real Madrid manager Xabi Alonso opened up on how he was pleased with the win and what it meant for the team.\n\n“I am happy with the comfortable victory, with Gonzalo’s hat-trick, and moreover with the great work of the team in addition to the goals.”\n\n“We’re really excited about the Spanish Super Cup with its express format. First up against Atleti. Let’s see if we win and play in the final,” he added, looking forward to the next game.\n\nXabi Alonso was full of praise for Gonzalo Garcia. (Photo by Luke Hales/Getty Images)\n\nHe then praised Gonzalo Garcia for scoring a hat-trick in a demanding situation, thereby filling in the shoes of Kylian Mbappe.\n\n“This is a dream game for Gonzalo. He was so excited to play today, and then he played and scored a hat-trick.”\n\n“I’m so happy for him. He’s an example all La Fabrica boys should follow,” he added.\n\nElaborating on what makes Gonzalo such a potent threat, he said,\n\n“Gonzalo García has a high goal-scoring instinct, and he also contributes significantly to defensive balance.”\n\n“When pressing high, coming close together, mid-blocks, and Gonzalo is really good at that, and he’s also really good at scoring goals, which is what strikers should do,” he added on the topic.\n\nThe manager was then asked about Vinicius Jr. and what he made of the player being whistled by fans for the second consecutive game.\n\n“Vini was excellent today, he really was. He started very strong, created differences, he got the right-back booked and taken off, he created chances.”\n\n“He is very important for us, and he’ll be very important in the next games,” he added.\n\nThe manager was then asked to give a message to the fans who were targeting the Brazilian winger, to which he calmly said,\n\n“We’re all mature, Vini is mature, and what we want is to show our highest level.”\n\n“He was, is, and will be very important for Real Madrid, and the fans will applaud him again, and give him ovations, I have no doubts,” he added.\n\nAlonso then went on to praise his team for working as a unit with complete synchrony against Real Betis.\n\n“Football today demands every team to work with 11 players without the ball.”\n\nAlonso also took a moment to praise Eduardo Camavinga and backed the midfielder to become even more important for the team in the coming games.\n\n“Camavinga is so important for us. Unfortunately, he couldn’t get a good run of games because he suffered from injuries.”\n\n“Whenever he plays, his dynamism and energy and ball-carrying are always so useful to us,” he added.\n\nThe Real Madrid manager did not reveal any information on Kylian Mbappe’s injury. (Photo by Mateo Villalba Sanchez/Getty Images)\n\nAn elated Alonso was then asked about Kylian Mbappe’s situation and whether the player will make it back for the Spanish Super Cup, to which he said,\n\n“We’ll see, it depends on how he feels.”\n\nHe then opened up the door to Mbappe, Vinicius, and Gonzalo all playing together in the games to come.\n\n“Kylian Mbappé, Vinicius Junior, and Gonzalo Garcia can all play together, why not? There are a lot of games, and we can’t rule anything out. It’s my decision.”\n\nStaying on the topic of injury updates, the manager then assured that Aurelien Tchouameni’s discomfort was minor.\n\n“Tchouameni went down in pain? He is traveling to Saudi Arabia no matter what.”\n\nLooking at the La Liga leaderboard and what the current matchday does to the standings, the manager said,\n\n“Barcelona won yesterday, and we need to win many matches. We have 45 points and are aiming to reach 90.”\n\n“Looking at the upcoming matches, the competition will be fierce. It starts soon with the Super Cup,” he added.",

    "description": "Leeds United 1-1 Manchester United: The Portuguese boss appeared irritated after the stalemate, prompting more questions about his future and unrest behind the scenes at Old Trafford",
    "fullText": "Not even a boring and fairly eventless draw brings about a day of little drama for Manchester United, it seems.\n\nIt was a point gained for Leeds United in their quest to stay in the Premier League and two dropped for their rivals’ pursuit of European football, but well after full-time, another story emerged in the Elland Road media room which could suggest all is not well behind the scenes at Old Trafford.\n\nWhile the game lacked entertainment, the bizarre press conference afterwards by Ruben Amorim brought a plot twist.\n\nIt was a scrappy and sloppy affair for 90 minutes, which didn’t really even have the blood and thunder feel this fixture is often built upon, and it ended in a draw after Matheus Cunha cancelled out Brenden Aaronson’s opener in the second half. The real bite and spark didn’t come until Amorim took centre stage.\n\nIt was the final few minutes of the media briefing which left more questions than answers. A hint at a power struggle and doubts over his future? Or was it simply just a man under pressure firing back at outside noise building yet again around his position at the club?\n\nHe walked out before those follow-up questions could come. It all came after a query about his downbeat demeanour during pre-match media duties on Friday and if his relationship had changed with the board.\n\n“Guys, to stop with that, and I noticed that you receive selective information about everything,” said Amorim. “I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United.\n\n“That is clear. I know that my name is not [Thomas] Tuchel, it’s not [Antonio] Conte, it’s not [Jose] Mourinho, but I’m the manager of Manchester United.\n\n“It’s going to be like this for 18 months, or when the board decides to change. That was my point. I want to finish with that. I’m not going to quit. I will do my job until another guy comes here to replace me.”\n\nAmorim was announced as head coach when he arrived in England 14 months ago, yet here he continually referenced that he is the \"manager\" who has more roles than just coaching the team. He laboured the point, and then he implored others, such as the sporting director, Jason Wilcox, to do their job, and he will do his for 18 months, which is when his current contract expires.\n\n“I just want to say that I’m going to be the manager of this team, not just the coach,” he added. “I was really clear on that. And that is going to finish in 18 months. And then everyone is going to move on. That was the deal. That is my job, not to be a coach.\n\n“If people cannot handle the Gary Nevilles and the criticism of everything, we need to change the club.\n\n“I just want to say that I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach. Every department, the scouting department, the sports director, needs to do their job. I will do mine for 18 months and then we move on.”\n\nIt seemed a shot across the bows at accusations he has been told to change from his much-debated 3-4-2-1 formation and questioned by those above him in United’s sporting structure about the style of play.\n\nBut maybe also insinuating that he won’t be looking to extend his stay beyond his current contract. Whether that will be his decision will come down to results, which, despite a solid performance here that wasn’t spectacular, still need to improve.\n\nThe words from Amorim will only spark more debate on an afternoon that hurt their season ambitions, but, given their absentees, it was not really a day of note until he spoke.\n\nThis and an away trip to Burnley on Wednesday end a run of fixtures seen more favourable for United. The point took them to fifth briefly, which will possibly be enough for Champions League qualification, but with Manchester City and Arsenal to come later this month, they could soon slip down the table.\n\nOn another day, if Benjamin Sesko had shown a more ruthless streak in front of goal to match his impressive build-up play, this could have been a big win away at one of their big rivals.\n\nYet on the other hand, if United goalkeeper Senne Lammens didn’t produce a fine save to deny a spectacular overhead kick from Noah Okafor, it could easily have been a sixth defeat in the Premier League.\n\nCunha did show some good finishing with his equaliser after a smart pass from Joshua Zirkzee in the 65th minute.\n\nThe latter had been introduced immediately after Aaronson had fired into the net three minutes earlier, after slack defending from United, who had been previously resolute.\n\nZirkzee’s cameo, an improved performance from Manuel Ugarte and Cunha’s perseverance were the positives on a day of few of them for Amorim and United.\n\nThe caveat is the absence of captain Bruno Fernandes, their main creator, as well as the injured Mason Mount, which compounds the fact Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo are off representing their countries at the Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nYet United have won just three league games since the start of November in an 11-game run littered with draws and two defeats, one of which was against a ten-man Everton and the other after a decent display against a high-flying Aston Villa.\n\nLeeds did play their part in a turgid game of football, which only started to flicker into some life after the hour mark, but never really caught fire.\n\nAaronson’s goal helped Leeds to move eight points clear of the bottom three, which is starting to look like a comfortable gap after an impressive run which has seen them remain unbeaten since defeat by City at the end of November. They’ve now picked up 11 points from a daunting December and turn of the year against Chelsea, Liverpool twice, Brentford, Crystal Palace, Sunderland and now their rivals from across the Pennines.\n\nWhile Leeds boss Daniel Farke has steadied their ship in recent weeks, Amorim appeared to rock the boat on another episode of the soap opera which is Manchester United.",

    "fullText": "Even the New York Jets' very own fans could not have envisioned the NFL history that could take place today against the Buffalo Bills. Whether you're pessimistic or optimistic, it's definitely not the good kind of history either.\n\nThe Jets will play the Bills at 4:25 P.M. today, and if they do not get an interception against Josh Allen, they will have gone through the entire season without getting a pick against an opposing quarterback. Making them the first team in NFL history to do so.\n\nThe projected starters this week do not necessarily have a history of turning the ball over, as the starters against the Bills have accounted for only 11 turnovers across their careers. Interceptions have been a bit of a foreign concept for the New York Jets for several years, but to go an entire season without having an interception is definitely something worth noting.\n\nThis offseason, the Jets will not focus solely on defense. Still, the franchise is aware of the shortcomings in competing in the NFL: being physical, playing fast, and forcing turnovers will be a priority in the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Touchdown Wire: New York Jets are on the brink of history, and not the good kind",

    "fullText": "Liverpool faced off against Fulham at Craven Cottage earlier today as they hoped to secure a win on the road in the Premier League. The Reds made a slow start to the game and conceded the opener in the 17th minute when Harry Wilson found the back of the net. Arne Slot’s men went into the half-time break 1-0 down on the scoreline.\n\nFlorian Wirtz equalised for the Merseyside club in the 57th minute before Cody Gakpo gave Liverpool the lead in injury time. However, Harrison Reed scored a dramatic equaliser with a brilliant strike soon after. The match ended with Arne Slot’s players being held to a lackluster 2-2 draw at Craven Cottage.\n\nLet’s take a look at how each Liverpool player fared during the clash against the Cottagers.\n\nHe failed to make a save in the game and conceded two goals this afternoon.\n\nBradley performed his defensive duties well and made one key chance going forward.\n\nHe cleared the danger when he could, but failed to keep things solid at the back.\n\nVan Dijk was far from convincing with his decision-making but was tidy with his passing.\n\nLONDON, ENGLAND – JANUARY 04: Arne Slot, Manager of Liverpool, applauds the fans following the Premier League match between Fulham and Liverpool at Craven Cottage on January 04, 2026 in London, England. (Photo by Justin Setterfield/Getty Images)\n\nHe came back to defend when required, but failed to impress going forward.\n\nGravenberch did his fair share of defending but lacked quality in the Fulham half.\n\nHe engineered a few key chances in the final third, but there was no goal for him.\n\nSzoboszlai was quiet for most of his time on the field.\n\nCAM: Alexis Mac Allister – 6.5/10\n\nHe worked hard defensively but lacked creativity in the final third.\n\nWirtz caught the eye at times in and around the Fulham penalty area and managed to score the equaliser in the 57th minute.\n\nHe was not shy of having a strike at goal and managed to put Liverpool ahead in injury time.",

Moments after his free-kick rattled the crossbar, ex-BVB fullback Achraf Hakimi was credited for the assist on his first start of the tournament.\n\nSimilarly, Stuttgart’s in-form attacker Bilal El Khannouss received his first starting berth.

    "fullText": "Pressure is growing around Inter Milan midfielder Kristjan Asllani, currently on loan at Torino, after the Granata’s sporting director Gianluca Petrachi openly questioned the player’s impact ahead of the January transfer window.\n\nSpeaking to Sky Sport, via FCInterNews, Torino director Petrachi confirmed that significant squad changes are being considered mid-season.\n\nIndeed, with exits required before any new arrivals can be finalised.\n\nHe explained that Torino’s squad size is already causing problems, stressing that movement in the market is inevitable.\n\n“We are trying to change something,” Petrachi said, outlining the club’s approach.\n\n“With the 3-5-2 system we need players who are functional. We have around 30 players under contract, with some not even registered. That’s penalising, to bring one in, someone else has to go.”\n\nMONZA, ITALY – AUGUST 12: Kristjan Asllani of FC Internazionale gestures during the Pre-season Friendly match between AC Monza and FC Internazionale at U-Power Stadium on August 12, 2025 in Monza, Italy. (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\nWithin that framework, Asllani’s situation has come into focus.\n\nWhen asked directly about the Inter-owned midfielder, Petrachi made his expectations clear.\n\nIndeed, insisting that more is required from the Albania international.\n\n“You hear everything during the transfer window,” he admitted, before adding pointedly.\n\n“But we certainly expect much more from Asllani. He’s an important player and he has to show on the pitch that he can be a starter.”\n\nTherefore, Petrachi went on to underline that minutes must be earned, not assumed.\n\n“Today he’s on the bench. We hope he can return to being a regular,” he said.\n\n“That applies to him and to many others. What’s needed is that healthy aggression, the hunger I demand from all the players.”",

    "fullText": "Following this weekend’s Under Armour All-America Game, the brand announced its first “Click Clack” NIL class. Under Armour signed six highly rated recruits to NIL deals.\n\nNotre Dame safety signee Joey O’Brien, BYU quarterback signee Ryder Lyons, Maryland EDGE signee Zion Elee and Alabama safety signee Jireh Edwards are all part of the group, Under Armour announced Sunday. Two touted 2027 recruits – Texas wide receiver commit Easton Royal and four-star wide receiver Eric McFarland – are also on board.\n\nAll six players competed in the Under Armour All-America Game on Saturday. O’Brien and Royal were two of Rivals’ top performers in the game, which took place at Spec Martin Stadium in Orlando, Fla.\n\n“I think you hear us coming,” Under Armour wrote in its Instagram post. “Meet the inaugural Click-Clack Class — Under Armour’s first NIL squad.”\n\nRyder Lyons previously announced an NIL deal with Under Armour in September 2025 after committing to BYU. The four-star quarterback signed with BYU, but will embark on a one-year mission and will not enroll at school until the following January. He is the No. 5-ranked quarterback from the 2026 cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking.\n\nAs a whole, Under Armour’s Click-Clack NIL class features four of the top 50 players in the nation out of the 2026 cycle. With Easton Royal and Eric McFarland, the brand also has two of the top 25 prospects in 2027.\n\nThe group includes some of the highest-profile high school football players, as well. Zion Elee’s $687,000 On3 NIL Valuation is the highest of the group and ranks No. 11 in the high school football NIL rankings. Lyons also sits at No. 13 with a $656,000 On3 NIL Valuation.\n\nThe On3 NIL Valuation is calculated by combining Roster Value and personal NIL. Roster value is the value an athlete has by being a member of his or her team at his or her school, which factors into the role of NIL collectives. NIL in an athlete’s name, image and likeness and the value it could bring to regional and national brands.",

    "description": "It’s fair to say 2025 wasn’t a particularly vintage year for WWE. But will 2026 be better? Here are some ideas that might help get the ball rolling.",
    "fullText": "It’s fair to say 2025 wasn’t a particularly vintage year for WWE. But will 2026 be better?\n\nIf Triple H and TKO are on the hunt for ideas that might make the product feel a little less stale in the new year, here are a handful that might help get the ball rolling.\n\nRemove the cornerstone that is (was!) John Cena and it’s tough to escape the conclusion that most of WWE’s PLE shows were on autopilot mode in 2025, with a lot of boilerplate matches, predictable conclusions and a lack of juicy rivalries.\n\nMy pet theory is it’s an inadvertent consequence of Triple H’s more sports-like presentation. We’ve seen over and again how the current leadership has opted for a more ESPN-friendly feel, relying on big matches to do the talking. But that has also meant stripping the “entertainment” from Vinnie Mac’s famous “sports entertainment” formula.\n\nYou can see this particularly on the weekly shows. How often do promo segments on “Raw” and “SmackDown” end up as boilerplate trash-talking, where the only question is when the interruption will come? What happened to all that rich backstage drama we used to see during the Bloodline era?\n\nThose narrative scenes didn’t just bring a bit of visual variety to the program, but sometimes turned into great television in their own right. Remember the high drama of the tribal court segment with Sami Zayn, for example?\n\nMaybe actually engage a few scriptwriters every now and then, rather than just leaving the matches to tell the stories.\n\nAnother hallmark of the Triple H era has been the slimmed down match cards. The effect has been more dramatic on the PLEs, but it’s affected the weekly shows too. It’s not uncommon for “Raw” to have four matches over three hours.\n\nQuality over quantity is welcome. But it’s also led to a dearth of opportunities on the mid-card. Secondary belts are rarely defended on the PLEs, and mid-carders who are introduced to great fanfare (Rusev, Aleister Black, Giulia) end up being booked intermittently, making it harder for the live crowds to get behind them.\n\nAdding to the slimmed down mid-card activity is the fact that much of that stuff now takes place in WWE’s partnership promotions instead. Look at the way Legado del Fantasma and the LWO have essentially been seconded to AAA, for example, or the fact that Chelsea Green has been doing her best work alongside Ethan Page across both NXT and TNA.\n\nAs someone who cheered WWE’s new partnerships model, I have to hold my hands up here: I didn't figure it'd lead to some of the emerging talent essentially disappearing from the weekly shows. My bad.\n\nWe don’t always agree on everything at Uncrowned. But one conclusion was pretty unanimous across our wrestling columnists and reviewers in 2025: There were far too many DQ finishes in main events in WWE — particularly on “Raw.”\n\nTo be honest, the problem hasn’t quite gone away. The DQ ratio has dropped since our investigation, admittedly, but we still seem to have too many back-to-back finishes involving members of The Vision or their allies interfering in each other’s matches — usually leading to some kind of group melee involving CM Punk, LA Knight or The Usos.\n\nIn theory, these kinds of scenes are meant to establish The Vision as the bad guys who can throw their weight around as they please. In practice, though, they just feel like the creatives are treading water until the bigger shows come around.\n\nWWE’s success depends on its flagship monthly shows. And after a period of chop and change on that front, it now seems that Triple H has settled on his preferred schedule as to which PLEs we get and when. But has he picked the right ones?\n\nIt’s pretty clear some PLEs are working less well than others. Take WarGames, for example, which often feels contrived given the need to hastily assemble alliances that usually get dropped straight afterward. The women’s WarGames matches tend to feel like they were booked using a Harry Potter sorting hat.\n\nElimination Chamber is another one. It’s a fantastic gimmick match, but the fact that it is always used to decide the remaining WrestleMania main-eventers makes it much more predictable than it used to be. Why not go back to putting titles on the line directly in the cage (the U.S. title, for example) and give it a fresher feel?\n\nI call it the curse of the character relaunch. How many WWE wrestlers have we seen brought back with flashy vignettes and a new mystique, only to see the whole idea dropped within weeks?\n\nWhite the graveyard of failed relaunches goes back a long way (Giovanni Vinci, Giovanni Vinci, Veer Mahan…), the most notorious example of 2025 has to be the whole “Ron Killings” relaunch. Despite making a pretty big splash at the time, it has since been totally retconned from existence.\n\nI get that creatives need to run ideas up the flagpole and see what works. But how is that meant to happen when things get dropped before they’ve even had a chance to make an impact?\n\nA quick question: What exactly was the reasoning for WWE’s Women’s Champion having a non-title match against Michin on a recent “SmackDown”? Don’t get me wrong — I had no problem with the match, per se. But what was the justification for Jade Cargill not putting her title on the line?\n\nWe saw this happen a lot in WWE in 2025. Cargill’s predecessor, Tiffany Stratton, had no fewer than five non-title singles matches on “SmackDown.” It happened on the men’s side too. Standout examples include Cody Rhodes vs. Aleister Black in November, and John Cena vs. R-Truth at Saturday Night’s Main Event back in May.\n\nOn each of these occasions it was never explained exactly why they were non-title matches. Most of the time, the champion ended up winning cleanly anyway, leaving the question as to why it couldn’t have been a standard title match.\n\nIt’s time for a much stricter approach. Non-title matches should be kept for circumstances that justify the exception — champion vs. champion matches, for example — rather than used for the sake of it.\n\nThis one is a personal bugbear, and a much smaller one. But hey, if you can’t use these moments to settle a few scores, when can you do it?\n\nCan 2026 be the year that wrestling crowds finally stop with the cursing chants? We get it: People think it’s fun to chant “f*** you, Gunther” or the like. The problem is WWE’s televised shows are still a PG product and it just ends up with the production team censoring the audio in a way that makes the shows much less fun to watch.\n\nWould it really be so bothersome just to not swear in the first place? I know, I know — I’m shouting into the wind here. After all, this is the same fan base that insists on doing the “What?!” chant after every second promo.",

    "fullText": "Countries’ commitments to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions can have important implications for their economies. Data since the 1800s reveal that the amount of CO2 emissions generated for a given level of output follows a bell-shaped curve. Pairing this with projections of future economic growth can help in predicting future overall emissions. Comparing actual data with past projections for levels of emission intensity reveals that reductions have been slower than predicted over the past 40 years. This divergence highlights the challenges many countries may face in reaching their emissions targets.\n\nMost countries have committed to reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions over the next few decades (United Nations 2021). These commitments can have important economic implications because they may involve reconfiguring the energy sector, adopting new production technologies, and a general shift in the industrial makeup of economies, to name a few (Fried, Novan, and Peterman 2021 and Gillingham and Stock 2018).\n\nIn this Economic Letter, we use historical CO2 emissions data to evaluate the evolution in the emission intensity of production. This refers to the amount of CO2 emissions per dollar of economic output produced, which can be used as a measure of emissions efficiency. The lower the emission intensity, the more likely countries are to meet their emissions targets given current trends of output growth. In assessing trends in emission intensity, we focus on the six largest carbon-emitting countries, which collectively represent about 75% of world emissions. Three of these countries—the United States, Japan, and Germany—represent advanced economies that developed early in the 20th century with highly inefficient technologies in terms of CO2 emissions. Over time, they have brought down their emissions per dollar significantly. The other three countries—China, India, and Russia—represent emerging economies that went through their industrial transition much later in the 20th century. Because production technologies available at that time had evolved to create less pollution, these three countries now face a quicker path toward cleaner production.\n\nBased on this historical evidence, we find that the emission intensities of these two groups over time can be approximated well by bell-shaped curves. We examine different economic growth scenarios and their implications for CO2 emissions relative to reduction commitments. Our analysis suggests that future paths of economic growth and efforts to reduce emission intensity are both important factors in assessing whether these countries will meet their stated targets.\n\nFollowing the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, commonly known as Glasgow COP26, world leaders reaffirmed their commitments to reducing CO2 emissions and limiting the increase in global average temperature to 1.5° Celsius (United Nations 2021). Achieving this target is likely to require countries to significantly reshape their economies, which can involve considerable transition costs (Gillingham and Stock 2018).\n\nHow can countries reduce fossil fuel emissions? At a basic level, there are only two ways: reduce overall economic output, and thus income and consumption for their citizens, or become more efficient by using cleaner technologies to produce the same goods and services with fewer emissions.\n\nWritten simply, the level of emissions equals an economy’s emission intensity multiplied by its economic output growth. Breaking down the problem into these two components is similar to approaches that some researchers use to forecast CO2 emissions (for example, Kaya and Yokobori 1997). Our approach provides a way to easily assess a country’s progress on its road toward lower emissions.\n\nWe begin by examining world emission intensity. Figure 1 displays global CO2 emissions divided by global GDP measured in U.S. dollars, which is a common way to compare output growth across countries, over the past 200 years. The dashed line shows the fit from a bell-shaped curve. We create the curve using three parameters that correspond to the peak intensity, when the peak occurs, and how long it takes for intensity to decline from the peak. The shaded regions are 68% confidence bands, which indicate the uncertainty related to the combination of our parameter estimates and how well the curve fits the data. The figure shows that a bell-shaped curve fits the historical path of emission intensity very well, capturing the rise of world intensity up to the 1920s and the gradual improvement since then.\n\nFigure 1\nGlobal CO2 emission intensity\n\nSources: Emissions: Ritchie, Roser, and Rosado (2020), based on Global Carbon Budget data. GDP levels: Maddison Project Database, accessed through Our World in Data. GDP growth rates and 2019–2021 levels: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\n\nTo gain a better understanding of this pattern over time, we turn to more granular data on individual countries. We focus on the world’s six highest-emitting countries, which collectively account for about 75% of global emissions as of 2021: China with 37.88% of global emissions, the United States with 16.53%, India with 8.95%, Russia with 5.80%, Japan with 3.52%, and Germany with 2.23%.\n\nWe classify these countries into two groups. The first group, including the United States, Japan, and Germany, represents large advanced economies, while the second group, China, India, and Russia, represents large emerging economies. This classification helps us broadly characterize the paths and challenges ahead for these two types of economies, rather than relying on aggregate numbers.\n\nFigure 2 shows emission intensity—defined earlier as the ratio of total emissions to total economic output—averaged for the advanced economies group (solid blue line) and the emerging economies group (solid red line). Data for Russia is only available since 1960. To avoid a large jump in the series at that date, we approximate Russian data before then using the average of data for China and India because all three countries follow similar historical paths.\n\nFigure 2\nCO2 emission intensity by country group\n\nSources: Emissions: Ritchie, Roser, and Rosado (2020), based on Global Carbon Budget data. GDP levels: Maddison Project Database, accessed through Our World in Data, and authors’ calculations. GDP growth rates and 2019–2021 levels: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\n\nFor both groups, we find that emission intensity is currently declining, implying that all countries are emitting less carbon per dollar of output produced relative to their respective peak emission intensity. In the case of the group of advanced economies, the decline of emission intensity began in the 1920s. For the group of emerging economies, the decline started from a lower peak level and took place much later, in the 1980s, which aligned with their economic development.\n\nTo model these trends of emission intensity, we find that fitting the data to bell-shaped curves again works surprisingly well for the two groups, as shown by the dashed lines in Figure 2, as well as at the individual country level (not shown). Focusing on the sample up to 2021, the dashed lines show that the bell-shaped curves nicely describe the magnitude of the emission intensity’s peak, the timing of when the peak occurs, and how quickly emission intensity declines from the peak.\n\nThe fitted curves also allow us to extrapolate the emission intensity for each group into the future. These projections are reported in Figure 2 to the right of the vertical line marking 2021. One major assumption underlying our extrapolation is that emission intensity will continue to decline at the rate dictated by the shape of the bell curve; despite the inherent uncertainty in projecting such trends, we believe that using history as a guide is a reasonable assumption.\n\nEmission intensity is only one part of the equation. The other part is determined by the rate at which countries continue to grow in the future. Therefore, in Figure 3, we present three different scenarios of output growth for our two groups.\n\nFigure 3\nProjected real GDP by country group\n\nThe first scenario relies on OECD long-term baseline projections for GDP growth for each country in the two groups through the year 2050. For the advanced economies group, shown in blue, the OECD’s average annual growth rate is 1.5%. For the emerging economies group, in red, the OECD’s average annual growth is 6.2%. The second and third scenarios assume a quarter percentage point higher and lower annual rates of growth per year, respectively. Over 27 years, these scenarios cumulate to 7% higher and lower growth for each group, shown by the upper and lower bounds of the shaded blue and red ranges.\n\nWe now have the two pieces needed to extrapolate emissions to 2050–emission intensity and output growth. Taking these pieces together, Figure 4 reports projected emissions by country group from 2021 to 2050. The solid lines report actual emissions for advanced (blue) and emerging (red) economies. The dashed lines show emissions predicted by our bell-shaped curve of emission intensity in combination with GDP projections. The figure also includes shaded regions that reflect both the uncertainty from the projections of our estimated bell curve, using plus and minus one standard deviation around the projections, and the range of assumptions for GDP growth based on OECD projections. Finally, we include horizontal lines corresponding to the 2030 emission reduction targets set by the countries of each group in accordance with Glasgow COP26. The targets were submitted as each country’s nationally determined contribution to the goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C (United Nations 2023). We calculated the target levels for the advanced and emerging economy groups by aggregating individual country-level commitments to the group level, shown by the two horizontal lines.\n\nFigure 4\nProjected emissions by country group\n\nSources: Emissions: Ritchie, Roser, and Rosado (2020), based on Global Carbon Budget data. GDP levels: Maddison Project Database, accessed through Our World in Data. GDP growth rates and 2019–2021 levels: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Country targets: United Nations (2023).\n\nWhat are the takeaways from Figure 4? The distance between the data and the model predictions (solid and dashed lines, respectively) since the 1990s shows that emissions have been running higher than our modeling framework would have predicted. In essence, the two groups are falling behind the curve. How quickly future emissions will decline is uncertain, as the wide ranges of our predictions suggest. Our exercise cannot project the potential effects of technological changes, economic shocks, and other sources of output and emissions variation. This means that the range of possible values shown in Figure 4 is likely to be even wider. Regardless of these sources of uncertainty, a comparison between the predictions and the 2030 commitments suggests that reaching these targets may require more extensive efforts from the countries in our sample.\n\nCountries worldwide have stated their commitments to reduce CO2 emissions over the next few decades. The lessons that we draw from our exercise in this Letter serve to sketch a more general view of the challenges to advanced and emerging economies when it comes to reducing fossil fuel emissions. Reaching 2030 targets may involve significant efforts to reduce emissions and have the potential to involve substantial economic changes to production, technology, use of resources, and saving and investment decisions (Fried, Novan, and Peterman 2021). Focusing on the top six emitting countries, we find that their emission intensity has considerably improved in the past few decades, though total emissions have been higher than expected over the past 40 years. Considering a relatively wide range of economic growth prospects, we find that—even with improvements in cleaner production technologies—countries are likely to fall well short of their intended emission reduction by 2030 and beyond.\n\nZoë Arnaut\nResearch Associate, Economic Research Department, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\n\nÒscar Jordà\nSenior Policy Advisor, Economic Research Department, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\n\nFernanda Nechio\nVice President, Economic Research Department, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\n\nFried Stephie, Kevin Novan, and William B.

    "fullText": "\"I recently read 'The Master, ' the biography of Roger Federer, who some would argue is one of the best (tennis) players, if not the best player, of all time. Every time I read one of the tennis biographies, you're reminded that it's a very all-consuming commitment to be one of the greatest. At least in the case of tennis, it's a very lonely existence. You're the only person out there. You in your mind battling it out. The key is making sure you surround yourself with the right team.\n\n\"Every player, at least in the major tournaments, has a player's box. You'll have the family, the coach, and some friends in the player's box.\n\n\"The lesson I think is who's in my player's box?  How do they help me keep going? And, similarly, at least in the investing world, am I in the player's box for others? How do I be the best person on the sidelines supporting?\"\n\n- Vinay Trivedi, General Atlantic\n\n\"This book explores sleep's impact on your body and mind.\"\n\n\"Before the coronavirus pandemic, I was a daily 4:30 A.M. workout warrior and advocate for holistic nutrition, but I certainly was not prioritizing sleep in my health equation. This was an eye-opening and convincing read that has helped me to get significantly more shut-eye.\"\n\n- Lacey Vigmostad Giliberto, JP Morgan\n\n\"I'm a bad sleeper. This book puts in layman's terms why you need to sleep and why it's important for so many reasons.\"\n\n\"It was a really interesting dichotomy. It's about a young African-American man who grew up in a rougher neighborhood in Newark but went to Yale and ended up being really successful in his academic work. But he struggled at times to mesh the two worlds together.\"\n\n\"It shows that the path to equality isn't always as easy and seamless. Going to Yale on a scholarship, it can still be really hard for people. People often don't get that.\"\n\n-Mir Subjally, Compass Rose Asset Management\n\n\"I am a little biased because I started my career at Citigroup, which is formerly Salomon Brothers. I also recommend 'Panic!' by Michael Lewis, and I generally like all the 'Market Wizards' series, which are helpful in knowing what fits your trading style and what doesn't.\"\n\n\"It shows that it's not just about you. In the grand scheme of things, it's how you help others along the way. How you can grow the pie for everyone.\"\n\n\"It's about striving to be somebody who gives to others and then expects nothing in return,\" she said, \"and how ironically fruitful that can be for your own life and career.\"\n\n- Lacey Vigmostad Giliberto, JP Morgan\n\nThe book holds insights into \"all the wrong reasons why you can go into finance.\"\n\n- Daniel Costanza, previously a head of data analytics at Yieldstreet\n\n\"It taught me that all decision-making should be driven by the gap between expected value and market price, and expected value is calculated by weighing each outcome by its probability of occurring.\n\n\"Second-level thinking is all about finding value that others don't appreciate yet. It's risk/reward times the coefficient of likelihood for being right.\"\n\n\"It's pretty technical, but a must-read for any quant.\"\n\n-Robert Lam, Man Group's Man Numeric\n\n\"I spend a lot of time with founder-led companies within the tech world. I like working with them because they're very focused on disrupting the status quo, not just in the businesses they're building but in anything they do, and that includes working with bankers and advisors writ large.\"\n\n\"They really force their advisors to think outside the box and challenge the traditional way of doing things. Part of Adam Grant's book is talking about what makes founders founders, and it's been incredible watching them ask a question that might be perceived as basic, but there's really sort of that double layer of, 'Why is it being done this way, and why can't we do it in a better, more efficient way?'\"\n\n\"He wrote this book that really shares some tips about how to have a happier life and ways that you can streamline things in your work; how to find a better work-life balance; and how to think about where you'd like to spend your time and how you're spending your time and the types of things you're investing in.\"\n\n\"I've picked up so many helpful tips and tricks from there. I feel like it's a must-read for people — financial-related or not, I think it applies to all different industries — on really how to take a step back and identify what is meaningful to you. And are you spending the right amount of time on things that you deeply care about versus things that are just, you know, background noise?\"\n\n\"I always thought a lot about what motivates people, how humans work, and what motivates them. I really appreciated his research and his take on that.\"\n\n\"It's one of the best management books. I think what's unique about the book is when I first looked at the title, I was a little bit intimidated by it — like, this is just for executive positions.\n\n\"But he looks at everyone being an executive in their role, and he provides some extremely practical advice on how to become more effective in anything we do in our everyday life. Some are well-known — such as time management, focusing on strengths.\n\n\"Even those obvious things that he brings up, he makes it so simple to apply in your everyday life. For example, on time management, there are just two questions you need to ask yourself on a regular basis: What would happen if I don't do certain things? And can these things be done by somebody else?\n\n\"That helps you to eliminate a lot of time-wasters and use time more wisely. Super simple, but at the same time, quite practical.\"\n\n- Mikhail Krayzler, Allianz Global Investors\n\n\"It's a book framed through the teaching of Marcus Aurelius, who was also a Roman emperor, and it covers how to optimize situations and make the best out of everything. The book does a great job of translating philosophy into modern context.\"\n\n\"As for how that translates to me: Clients expect a trusted advisor to maintain poise and equanimity in situations that are stressful to them. So this has been helpful in taking a teaching that is 2,000-plus years old and transferring it to the 21st century.\"\n\n- Christopher Oglesby, Bank of America\n\n\"Everything in the investing business is relationship-based, and Henry and George, the KKR founders, often talk about doing business with people you like and trust. This is a book I've read three or four times and is really a staple.\"\n\n\"What the author is trying to do is to help the reader look at the world and analyze global trends in a more objective way. In a very engaging and comical way, he shows you that human beings tend to think that the world is more dramatic than it really is. So people's brains are systematically misinterpreting the state of the world.\n\n\"Something that really hits on that point is the beginning of the book. He presents the reader with a set of 13 questions. Each question has three multiple-choice answers. The bottom line is that most people actually score lower than the theoretical chimpanzee would have on these questions.\n\n\"He tries to walk you through a formula to avoid looking at the world in this overly dramatized way. I think he's not talking specifically about the financial markets, but I think it's so relevant to investing because this is part of the way you can capitalize on opportunities.\"\n\n- Unoma Okolo,  Artisan Partners\n\n\"It's a great book about monetary policy in the Depression era that has major implications for how monetary policy and currencies have evolved.\"\n\n- Phil Salinger, former Bridgewater Associates\n\nThe book emphasizes \"how a growth mindset — or the belief that talents can be developed with hard work and good strategies and input from others — can enable much better outcomes than people with a fixed mindset, which is believing that talents are just innate gifts.\"\n\n\"The reason that a growth mindset matters so much is that it fosters an emphasis on learning and intellectual curiosity instead of trying to seem like the smartest person in the room, and that's something that I often reflect on for my own personal development as well, as a quality to look for as we bring on really amazing management teams.\"\n\n- Lexie Bartlett, General Atlantic\n\n\"For me, it's a game plan of how to actually seek solutions to the biggest existential threat that we actually face as a species and as a planet. Whenever I introduce people to the book, you see people get obsessed with the kinds of things that we can be doing, whether that's regenerative agriculture, renewable energy, or reducing food waste.\"\n\n\"Being a Fidelity person, I had to pick a Peter Lynch book. Beating the Street has been one of my favorites, such a classic. It's about how Peter ran Magellan day-to-day. And so I've just found it to be an excellent guide to investment processes for new fund managers.\"\n\n- Jennifer Fo Cardillo, Fidelity\n\n\"Much has been said about 'Margin of Safety' over the years, but in my opinion nothing quite compares to the original \"Security Analysis\" by Benjamin Graham and David L. Dodd. They epitomized the concept through their careful approach, still relevant to this day.\"\n\n- Paul Kamenski, Man Group's Man Numeric\n\n\"I recently read 'Shoe Dog,' which is Phil Knight's autobiography and the story of how he founded Nike. I chose it because our firm is, in some respects, a startup, as we are launching new lines of business and building upon others, and I wanted to learn about an entrepreneur's success story.\n\nNike certainly had some difficult and existential issues in its early years, and the book was a good reminder about the importance of perseverance and believing in the value of one's work.\"\n\n- Jackie Klaber, Rockefeller Capital Management\n\n\"It is an interesting read, and I enjoy how David Einhorn seems so relentless when he believes in something.\"\n\n- Tanaka Maswoswe, Carlyle Group\n\nBob Iger, a former CEO at Disney, \"early on saw the need to create digital channels for his customers and understood the virtuous cycle he could create around the right types of content, which informed his M&A strategy. Some of the M&A moves that he did in the preceding 10 years were really prescient.\"\n\n\"Reading the stories of great investors is both fun and informative. What's most interesting is the commonalities you see between the two investors despite radically different approaches and asset classes.\"\n\n- Philip Dobrin, Bridgewater Associates\n\n\"There's a lot of game theory involved, analyzing big data to predict outcomes. The concepts in that book and trilogy are very relevant today.\"\n\n\"Looks at the benefits of late specialization and a diversity of experience, and how knowledge in a variety of arenas can pay off, especially when solving complex problems that require creative solutions.\"\n\nWe read it as part of an Asian-American affinity group at TPG. It's a very tactical book on how Asian Americans can advance in the workplace, and it's written in a style that gives stories of actual people but gives very tangible advice. I enjoyed it quite a bit.\n\n\"Compared with what has now often become fairly complex and evolved, his works as an early adopter of the approach were simple, intuitive, and persuasive, establishing clear roots for what it means to use a systematic approach.\"\n\n- Paul Kamenski, Man Group's Man Numeric\n\nA \"must-read\" for any aspiring tech investors.\n\n\"The book best represents how I think about investing and also articulates the success stories and habits of the best CEOs of the 20th century.\"\n\n- Sims Lansing, Lansing Management\n\n\"'Flash Boys' was a prime example of how technological innovation and forward-thinkers can reshape an entire industry. In 'Flash Boys,' novel computer algorithms and communications networks caused both market structure and behavioral changes to the trading industry.\n\n\"Similarly, today we're experiencing the confluence of cryptography, blockchain technology, and distributed systems, which are meaningfully challenging preconceived notions of not just the financial industry but what constitutes money.\"\n\n- Michael Sonnenshein, Securitize\n\n\"We have all this data and information on our laptops and on our phones, but it's not organized. So is it really serving us, is it really useful for us?\n\n\"The book talks about knowledge management systems and how to organize the data in such a way that works for the individual, and ultimately, getting to a point where we can share that with others.\"",

    "description": "Nicolás Maduro is reportedly in NYC's Metropolitan Detention Center, known for high-profile inmates like Luigi Mangioni and Sean \"Diddy\" Combs.",
    "fullText": "Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores are reportedly awaiting their first court appearance at a Brooklyn jail famous for its poor conditions.\n\nNumerous publications, including The Wall Street Journal, have reported that the pair were escorted to the Metropolitan Detention Center late Saturday after arriving by plane in New York.\n\nMDC, which has yet to confirm the transfer to Business Insider, has been home to numerous high-profile defendants facing trial in New York City, including music mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of fallen bitcoin exchange FTX, and Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of aiding the sex trafficking operation of the deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nLuigi Mangioni has been housed at MDC while awaiting trial for the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe jail has been widely criticized over the years for its poor conditions, having been described as \"inhumane\" and \"hell on earth.\"\n\nLast year, the Legal Aid Society issued a press release lamenting the jail's \"documented history of violence, medical neglect, and human and civil rights violations.\" It cited reports of no heat during the winter and \"maggot-infested food.\"\n\nIn 2024, a federal judge in Brooklyn made headlines when he carved out a special exemption during sentencing to help a defendant avoid the MDC. The judge ruled that if the 74-year-old, convicted of tax fraud, were assigned to the MDC, he could serve his time under house arrest, The New York Times reported.\n\nIn March, Brooklyn federal prosecutors announced charges against 25 defendants in 12 separate cases tied to violence and contraband smuggling at the jail, which is located in the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn.\n\n\"Over the years, MDC has become synonymous with egregious neglect and abuse with the people incarcerated,\" the Legal Aid Society said in a June press release opposing ICE detentions at the jail.\n\nPresident Donald Trump shocked the world on Saturday when he announced that the US had captured the Venezuelan president and his wife after a \"large-scale strike\" on Venezuela.\n\nTrump has said the US is \"going to run the country\" until it can facilitate a safe transition of power, and that US oil companies will now be free to \"spend billions\" on development in the South American nation.\n\nMaduro has been in the US Department of Justice's crosshairs for years, and in 2020, Manhattan federal prosecutors indicted him as a leader of the Cartel de Las Soles, its name for the alleged drug-trafficking organization run by Venezuela's military and political elite.\n\nAn expanded indictment unsealed on Saturday added as defendants Maduro's wife and son, Nicolás Ernesto Maduro Guerra, identified in the indictment as \"The Prince.\" It accused them of participating in a wide-ranging effort to traffic drugs to the US to enrich themselves.",

    "description": "After an exhausting week caring for my grandsons, I realized the real lesson wasn't perfection but the quiet power of grace.",
    "fullText": "On day five of caring for my 2-year-old and 8-year-old grandsons full-time, I almost snapped.\n\nI had slept just a few hours and woke up dehydrated, my tongue dry and sticky, my head aching. In the bathroom, I noticed yellow specks on the porcelain rim. Not surprising with a 2-year-old in the house.\n\nBut then, at 7 a.m., there it was: a puddle circling the toilet with a musty odor rising from it. I flicked on the fan, reached for a paper towel to sop up the mess, and cautioned myself against overreacting.\n\nThroughout the week, I had offered to help, but George always said he could do it himself. Then, he'd slam the door into its frame.\n\nThat puddle challenged my composure. \"Keep calm,\" I told myself. \"He's only 2, and at least you're not changing poopy diapers.\"\n\nGeorge knocked and asked if I was taking a shower. I stepped into the hallway and let him know I wasn't happy.\n\nI told him there was pee all over the floor.\n\nBoth Grandpa and his older brother, Stanley, had shown him how to pee in a toilet, but apparently, George liked to lift the seat and aim for the circular opening. I'd watched him steer an RC car through impossible turns, so aiming into a toilet shouldn't have been difficult.\n\nGeorge dropped his head. This non-stop chatterer went silent. He turned toward the wall and buried his face in his shoulder.\n\nAfter breakfast, George became his talkative self again as he drove trucks through kinetic sand, performed somersaults off the couch, and wheeled his scooter from room to room. When he needed a bathroom break, he opted for nature pees in the backyard.\n\nBut then, as I made lunch, George scooted into the bathroom and slammed the door.\n\nI gave him some time, then slowly, silently, peeked inside. He wasn't sitting. He wasn't standing. He was kneeling — reaching toward the back wall with a gigantic wad of toilet paper. The bowl was clogged with more paper — voluminous amounts of it.\n\nWhat I wanted to say: WE TALKED ABOUT THIS!\n\nWhat I actually said: Nothing. I just sighed.\n\nThat's when big brother Stanley intervened. During the day, George followed Stanley around, imitating his every move. At night, they shared a bedroom. They had bunk beds, but instead of using the top and bottom, George and Stanley chose to sleep side by side, arms around each other, in the bottom bunk.\n\nStanley took one look at George on his knees, flashed a big smile, and suggested I praise him for his good work.\n\nThen Stanley looked right at George and told him what a good boy he was. No mention of clogging the toilet. No scolding that the mess was unnecessary. No criticism of the sticky wet floor. Not even a reminder to wash his hands. Just arms open for a hug.\n\nI stood there speechless for a few seconds. Where I saw disaster, Stanley saw effort. While I considered a lecture, he opened his arms.\n\nI herded both boys to the sink for hand washing before lunch. After a bite to eat, we played with Monster Trucks, and when George got cranky, I put him in bed for a nap. Then I played cards with Stanley and cleaned the bathroom with chlorine bleach.\n\nWhen George woke up, my husband suggested an hour at the park. With Stanley at a friend's house, George, Grandpa, and I headed off on foot.\n\nGeorge is Grandpa's boy. Every sentence begins, \"Grandpa, watch…\" or \"Grandpa, look at this…\" or \"Grandpa, can I….\" He holds Grandpa's hand in every parking lot and sits in Grandpa's lap for every book.\n\nBut as we approached an intersection and Grandpa prompted him to hold hands, George surprised me.\n\nInstead of taking Grandpa's hand, he reached for me, squeezed my palm, and held on long after we crossed the street. His tiny fingers curled into my fist said he wanted us to be right again.\n\nAt bedtime, when he usually chose Grandpa, George asked me to read him a book. Five books. We didn't talk about bathrooms or disinfectants or a better aim. I just snuggled him in my lap, pulled a blanket over us, and read the words slowly, to enjoy the story a little longer. I tucked him under the covers with Doggie, his favorite stuffed toy. I kissed him and said I love you.\n\nIt was 8 p.m. when I joined Grandpa in the living room, too tired to read my own book, pick up stray Hot Wheels, or empty the dishwasher. Longing for bed myself, I thought about the last several hours and what I should have done better.\n\nAnd I realized the lesson of the day was not how to pee into a toilet, reason with a 2-year-old, or keep a bathroom spic and span.\n\nThe lesson was that we all need a little grace.\n\nStanley praised George, not for succeeding, but for trying. When was the last time I'd done that?\n\nIn our world of high expectations, perfection often feels like the goal. We're so conditioned to correct and fix — our children, coworkers, or strangers on Instagram — that we forget what encouragement looks like.\n\nAnd then there was George. Without words, he reached for my hand, an ordinary kindness with extraordinary power. Adults often forget this truth, too, that love repairs itself with simple gestures.\n\nThe best love, I realized, isn't earned through perfection, but offered in the middle of our messes.",

    "description": "I booked a one-way ticket to Central America after a tragedy back home in the US. I made mistakes and learned tough lessons, but it was great.",
    "fullText": "It's been almost four years since a condo fire sent me packing to Central America for my first-ever solo backpacking trip.\n\nNew passport in hand, I flew to Belize to get scuba certified and maybe \"find myself\" — but honestly, I had no clue what I was getting into.\n\nThat first month backpacking was life-changing, but it was also messy, humbling, and painfully lonely at times. I never ended up moving back to the US, and since that one-way flight, I've met so many others who hit the road after a major loss.\n\nThe tragedy-to-travel pipeline is so real. If you're thinking about taking your first solo trip after a tough chapter, here are a few mistakes I made that you may hopefully avoid.\n\nI was grieving and anxious when I left, and it showed in my backpack. I ended up lugging around a massage gun, a portable clothes-washing bag, a headlamp, and plenty of clothes that I never wore.\n\nI packed as if Central America had no laundromats or stores, even though they had plenty. Dragging that overstuffed bag onto buses, boats, and up hostel staircases was a pain.\n\nA few comfort items, like a small candle or photos from home, are nice to have, but really, you just need the essentials.\n\nI was so focused on getting out the door that I completely overlooked basics, like checking visa rules, entry requirements, and my wallet.\n\nFirst, in a panic at the airport, I had to buy a last-minute return flight to the US just so I could board my plane at LAX. I somehow hadn't realized proof of onward travel was required to enter Belize (as is the case when flying to most countries).\n\nDuring the trip, I also lost my only debit card and didn't have backup methods for paying for things. Western Union was a lifesaver, but asking my parents to transfer money to me was definitely humbling.\n\nLastly, I accidentally overstayed my 30-day tourist visa in Belize and later got fined for doing so.\n\nWhen you're traveling solo and dealing with heartbreak, it's tempting to spill your guts when someone asks a simple question about your trip.\n\nBut not everyone is ready to hear your story, and that's OK. Sometimes I had genuine heart-to-hearts with people I met on my travels, but other times, I felt like a fool for opening up.\n\nThe truth is, most people are on vacation to relax and aren't looking for a sad story. I had to learn to be more discerning about who I shared my story (and time) with.\n\nDiscernment is an essential travel skill. And if you're traveling heartbroken, virtual therapy is a lifesaver.\n\nHostels sounded like a great idea since they're popular with solo travelers and can be a great space to socialize.\n\nI thought I'd meet fellow travelers, have deep conversations, and make lifelong friends … but the first few places I stayed were full-on party hostels. Guests were drinking and blasting loud music until 3 a.m., which wasn't my vibe.\n\nI felt like I couldn't connect with most people I met, so I did some research and started booking quieter, low-key hostels and some private Airbnbs, which changed the whole vibe of the trip for me.\n\nWhere you stay on a trip like this really matters — especially if you're traveling to heal and form genuine connections.\n\nUltimately, throughout the trip, I distracted myself from the reason I had gone in the first place.\n\nI filled my days with scuba diving, touring ruins, hiking, and snorkeling. At night, I'd go for drinks with new friends. Though I was having fun, I wasn't giving myself space to grieve.\n\nAfter a few weeks, my feelings came crashing out at the wrong time and in the wrong places.\n\nThe ocean can't fix your pain, and neither can the mountains. They can only hold you while you move through it — and travel can take you to some amazing places where you can really feel it all.\n\nThat first month in Belize wasn't seamless, but it was exactly what I needed. It marked the beginning of a much longer inward journey — one that continues today.",

    "description": "A simple trick for a 750-fold speedup.",
    "fullText": "My solution to Advent of Code 2025 day 9 gave the right answer, but it was massively too slow. It was taking about 20 minutes to give a solution, when the target was a few seconds. Time to do something about it.\n\nThe first thing was to find out exactly what was taking the time. Profiling the code showed that over 98% of the runtime was spent in the calculation of greenWithin in the validRectangle check.\n\nOn the face of it, that's a fairly simple check, and the call to inRange should be quick. Each check of the elements of theatre should be fast. But how many checks are being made?\n\nFor my input, there are over 120,000 rectangles to check, and the theatre contains almost 590,000 tiles. That's getting on for 1011 checks for the whole lot. That's a lot of checking to do! No wonder it takes so long.\n\nThat gives two avenues for optimising. One is to reduce the size of the theatre, the other is to reduce the number of rectangles that are checked. Addressing the theatre size is the easiest, so let's do that first.\n\nThe idea of coordinate compression is essentially a \"sparse\" representation of the coordinates. Rather than using the coordinates directly, you first sort the coordinates then build a lookup table going from sorted position to actual coordinate (and one going in reverse).\n\nGoing from the sample in the problem specification, the original x coordinates are 2, 7, 9, and 11. Those get compressed down to 0, 1, 2, 3, with the mapping being\n\nI apply the same to the y coordinates, and the theatre and boundary goes from\n\nThis works for rectangle validity because the tests are all about if a particular tile exists between two others, not how many of them there are. The existence of tiles remains the same in this representation.\n\nThe compression is done with mkCompressedTheatre:\n\nThis returns the compressed theatre and the mappings to go from original coordinates to the compressed ones. In my case, the compression moves the theatre from 590,000 tiles to only 1630, a factor of 360 smaller.\n\nThe definition of allValidRectangles changes to use the compressed theatre.\n\nThat brings the runtime down from 20 minutes to 2½ seconds, 480 times faster.\n\nThe ray-casting part of the validity test may not always be accurate now, but it's still correct for the largest rectangles, which are the ones I'm interested in.\n\nThat's an impressive speedup, but there's still the other idea to do. Currently, both parts of the solution generate all the rectangles and process them all to find the largest rectangle (or largest valid rectangle). But if I generate all the rectangles and sort them by size, that saves work for finding the solutions.\n\nGiven a list of possible rectangles in order of size, the solution to part 1 is just the first of them, and the solution to part 2 is the first valid one. This allows me to exploit some laziness, in that I don't have to check validity for any rectangle smaller than the largest valid one.\n\nThe sorting will take some time, but hopefully that'll be outweighed by the time saved by not testing all the rectangles in part 2.\n\nThat changes how I set up and call the solution functions.\n\nThis is faster still, taking the runtime down from 2½ seconds to about 1.6 seconds, or about 750 times faster than the original version.\n\nNot bad for a little bit of effort!\n\nYou can get the code from Codeberg.",

    "title": "Revisiting HTML streaming for modern web performance",
    "description": "Introduction...",
    "fullText": "Modern web performance issues often come from delayed rendering rather than network speed. Client-side hydration and heavy JavaScript pipelines can prevent browsers from showing content as early as they could. Several solutions already exist, like SSR or SSG to mitigate this. They help a lot, but in practice, SSG pages need to be rebuilt when content changes, and SSR alone cannot make expensive time-consuming operations like database queries or API calls available in request response bodies.\n\nThis becomes more complex with dynamic data, for example a product page where stock or availability can change. Combining good SEO with asynchronous and incremental content is still difficult. Pages are often fast and static, or dynamic but expensive to render and crawl.\n\nThis article looks again at HTML streaming, inspired by Chris Coyier’s article Streaming HTML, as one possible answer to this problem. It is based on an experimental project called HTMS, which explores progressive HTML rendering and the trade-offs that come with it.\n\nOver the years, web applications have moved more and more logic to the client side. This brought a lot of flexibility, but also new performance issues. Even when the server responds quickly, users often wait for JavaScript to download, parse, and execute before seeing meaningful content.\n\nHydration is one of the main sources of this delay. HTML may arrive early, but it is often treated as inactive until JavaScript takes control. During this time, the page can look empty or incomplete, even if the data is already available.\n\nThis also creates an SEO and accessibility problem. With a typical SPA, the initial HTML can be very small, and most of the real content is generated after JavaScript runs. For example, a screen reader can receive something like this:\n\nIn this case, the important content is not in the HTML at all. It will appear only after the client-side code runs. Some crawlers can execute JavaScript, but it is slower, less reliable, and it can hide problems until later.\n\nFrom a performance point of view, this affects key metrics like First Contentful Paint, Largest Contentful Paint, and Cumulative Layout Shift. From a user point of view, it simply feels slow.\n\nServer-side rendering (SSR) improves early rendering by sending a more complete HTML response. JavaScript is then used to fetch or update data using fetch, WebSockets, or Server-Sent Events. The limitation is that dynamic data is often not part of the initial response, which makes SEO more fragile.\n\nStatic site generation (SSG) produces fully static HTML that is excellent for SEO, but requires rebuilds when content changes. This works well for mostly static pages, but is less adapted to frequently updated or live data.\n\nHTML streaming is not a new idea. From the beginning of the web, servers have been able to send responses progressively, and browsers have always been able to render HTML as it arrives.\n\nThe core idea is simple: instead of waiting for all the data to be ready, the server starts sending HTML immediately. The browser parses it, builds the DOM, and paints content step by step. This allows users to see something useful very early.\n\nFor people who have been around the web for a long time, this is not a new feeling. It is similar to how images loaded on slow connections, like 56k modems. Images appeared line by line, giving an early preview instead of a blank screen.\n\nIn practice, streaming is often replaced today by a single HTML response delivered in one chunk, followed by client-side rendering. This shifts most of the work to JavaScript and delays the first meaningful paint.\n\nStreaming takes a different approach. The server sends an initial HTML skeleton, then continues the response with more HTML fragments when data becomes available.\n\nInstead of treating HTML as a static document, it becomes a progressive delivery format again, with the browser doing what it does best. Instead of sending an almost empty HTML document and waiting for JavaScript, a streamed response can look like this:\n\nAt this time, the browser can render the header, navigation, and some contents, without waiting for client-side JavaScript. Later in the same response, once the data is ready, the server continues sending chunks:\n\nThis approach is already very good. The response is progressive and does not block rendering. The page structure appears early, which improves the user experience and works very well for SEO.\n\nAll the content is delivered as part of the response. There is no hidden state and no client-side rehydration. What the browser receives is exactly what users and crawlers see.\n\nThe main limitation is flexibility. The layout follows a strict sequence and HTML must arrive in the right order. Updating specific parts of the page later can be difficult.\n\nHTMS is an attempt to keep these benefits, while reducing the layout constraints. This will be explored in the next section.\n\nAfter reading Chris Coyier’s article and its references, and looking at what already existed around HTML streaming, it felt like a good topic to explore in practice.\n\nAt the same time, I was looking for a concrete project to practice Rust. It is a language I enjoy a lot, but I do not often get the opportunity to use it. HTML streaming looked like a good fit for a small but real experiment.\n\nThe first version of HTMS was a Rust proof of concept, focused on sending HTML as early as possible. It helped validate the idea, but it was limited by my velocity in Rust.\n\nAs the experiment grew, JavaScript became more practical to explore new APIs. It also has a larger community, which makes experimentation easier. Today, the Rust version is a minimal reference. The JavaScript version is where most of the work happens.\n\nBasic HTML streaming already improves rendering, but it quickly reaches its limits when pages become more dynamic. Once the layout grows, keeping a strict sequential order becomes difficult.\n\nThe idea behind HTMS is to keep the same progressive delivery model, while making updates more flexible. Instead of sending only linear HTML, the server can describe how later fragments should update parts of the page.\n\nPlaceholders play a central role. They are real HTML elements rendered early, with a clear position in the layout. When new data becomes available, these placeholders are replaced or extended with final content.\n\nBecause placeholders exist in the initial HTML, layout shifts are easier to avoid. The browser already knows where content will appear, and updates do not require a client-side rehydration step.\n\nThis keeps the page fully usable during loading, while still allowing asynchronous data to arrive later in the same response.\n\nTo illustrate how HTMS works, let’s look at a product page. This is a good use case for SEO and performance because we want the main content to be indexed, but some parts like stock or reviews might take more time to fetch.\n\nIn the initial HTML template, we define placeholders using the data-htms attribute. These will be shown immediately while the server gets the dynamic data.\n\nOn the server side, we have async functions for these placeholders.\n\nFinally, we use the HTMS pipeline to link the template and the functions together and stream the response to the client.\n\nWhen a user visits the page, they instantly see the “Loading…” messages. As each async function completes on the server, the corresponding HTML fragment is streamed and the placeholder is replaced in the browser.\n\nAll this happens in a single HTTP request, without any client-side framework or complex hydration.\n\nOne of the most important benefits is that the final response is a complete HTML document for crawlers or browsers. Even if parts arrived later in the stream, the final “view source” looks something like this:\n\nThe <htms-chunk> elements are custom elements (Web Components) that the HTMS mini (~2KB minified) runtime uses to replace placeholders.\n\nBecause these chunks are part of the initial HTTP response, search engines can index the full content. The browser’s DOM will eventually reflect the merged state, but the “raw” response has everything needed for SEO.\n\nTechnically, it would be possible to avoid the JS runtime by using the new Declarative Shadow DOM API. But this won’t be explored here. Maybe a future contribution from the community?\n\nOne of the goals of this experiment was to validate whether HTML streaming with progressive updates could work well with common performance metrics.\n\nA public demo is available at https://htms.skarab42.dev to see this in action. Despite serving dynamic content incrementally, the page achieves very strong Lighthouse results, including a 100/100 score for Performance. This is not an empty or static page; real content is streamed and rendered progressively.\n\nThese results mainly come from how early the browser can start rendering. The initial HTML arrives quickly, contains meaningful structure, and does not wait for client-side JavaScript to execute.\n\nAs a result, First Contentful Paint and Largest Contentful Paint happen very early. Layout stability is also easier to control. Because placeholders define the layout from the start, content updates do not introduce unexpected shifts, which keeps Cumulative Layout Shift low.\n\nHTMS does not try to optimize Lighthouse directly. Instead, the metrics improve as a natural consequence of working with the browser rendering model, rather than against it.\n\nHTML streaming is built on standard HTTP features. The response is sent using chunked transfer encoding:\n\nThis works well with common compression algorithms like gzip or Brotli. HTML chunks are compressed as they are streamed, without preventing progressive rendering in the browser.\n\nThe live demo shows this behavior in practice: content is streamed, compressed, and rendered incrementally, without waiting for the full response to complete.\n\nBecause HTMS relies on server-rendered HTML, SEO comes naturally. All content is part of the HTTP response, even if some parts arrive later in the stream. There is no dependency on client-side JavaScript for crawlers to discover or index the page.\n\nThis model also changes how failures behave. If JavaScript fails or is disabled, the page still contains meaningful HTML. If an error happens during streaming, what has already been sent remains readable.\n\nThis is both a benefit and a constraint, since traditional error handling like returning a clean 500 page is no longer possible once streaming has started.\n\nAccessibility benefits from the same progressive model. Placeholders are real HTML elements that exist in the DOM from the beginning. When content is updated, HTMS automatically adds ARIA attributes when possible, depending on the chosen injection mode.\n\nThis allows updates to be announced using standard semantics like aria-live or role=\"status\", without requiring complex client-side logic. HTMS builds on existing HTML and ARIA behavior, keeping accessibility predictable and easier to reason about.\n\nHTML streaming comes with real benefits, but also important trade-offs.\n\nIn HTMS, errors coming from async functions used in templates are captured. Depending on the configuration, they can be rendered inside the streamed HTML or replaced with fallback content. If an error happens before the first chunk is sent, the server can still return a regular 500 response. Once streaming has started, error handling must happen inside the stream itself.\n\nStreaming also depends on the transport path. Some clients, proxies, or CDNs may buffer responses, reducing or completely removing the benefits of progressive delivery.\n\nStructural constraints are another limitation. Placeholders must exist early in the HTML, and some layout decisions need to be made before all data is available. In practice, this can be mitigated, or even avoided, by combining HTMS with tools like HTMX or other client-side solutions that can take over after the initial page has been served. This kind of combination is not only possible, but encouraged.\n\nMore generally, HTML streaming works best when combined with other approaches like SSR, SSG, or SSE, to get the best of each world rather than relying on a single technique.\n\nThis list is far from exhaustive. I expect the community to find more limitations and challenge existing solutions.\n\nHTML streaming is not a new technique, but it is still surprisingly relevant. Many modern performance problems come from working against the browser instead of letting it render HTML as early as possible.\n\nHTMS is an experimental project that explores this space. It is not meant to replace existing solutions, but to show how streaming HTML can work well with modern requirements like performance, SEO, and accessibility.\n\nIn practice, the best results come from combining approaches. HTML streaming can be used alongside SSR, SSG, SSE, or tools like HTMX, each one handling what it does best.\n\nMore importantly, this work is an invitation to experiment. There is still a lot to explore in this area, and many open questions to challenge as the web platform continues to evolve. For example, caching is a topic that needs to be explored and completely avoided in this article.\n\nI really enjoyed working on this project. I do not know yet if I will push it much further, but everything is in place for curious people to experiment with HTML streaming in a simple way.\n\nIf this article makes you want to explore, try, or even break things, then it already did its job.\n\nThat said… this Declarative Shadow DOM thing is still very tempting.",

    "fullText": "Out of all 49 beautiful US states (plus New Jersey), the one you’d probably least want to camp outside in during the winter is arguably Alaska. If you were to spend a night camping out in the Alaskan winter, your first choice of shelter almost certainly wouldn’t be a USPS electric cargo trike, but over on YouTube [Matt Spears] shows that it’s not that hard to make a lovely little camper out of the mail bike.\n\nWe’re not sure how much use these sorts of cargo trikes get in Alaska, but [Matt] seems to have acquired this one surplus after an entirely-predictable crash took one of the mirrors off. A delta configuration trike — single wheel in front — is tippy at the best of times, but the high center of gravity you’d get from a loading the rear with mail just makes it worse. That evidently did not deter the United States Postal Service, and it didn’t deter [Matt] either.\n\nHis conversion is rather minimal: to turn the cargo compartment into a camper, he only adds a few lights, a latch on the inside of the rear door, and a wood-burning stove for heat. Rather than have heavy insulation shrink the already-small cargo compartment, [Matt] opts to insulate himself with a pile of warm sleeping bags. Some zip-tie tire chains even let him get the bike moving (slowly) in a winter storm that he claims got his truck stuck.\n\nWhile it might not be a practical winter vehicle, at least on un-plowed mountain roads, starting with an electric-assist cargo trike Uncle Sam already paid for represented a huge cost and time savings vs starting from scratch like this teardrop bike camper we featured a while back. While not as luxurious, it seems more practical for off-roading than another electric RV we’ve seen.",

    "title": "What Is Claude Code's Plan Mode?",
    "description": "What I learned about plan mode as a non-plan mode user who plans.",
    "fullText": "I’ve mentioned this a few times now, but when I started using Claude it was\nbecause Peter got me hooked on it. From the very\nbeginning I became a religious user of what is colloquially called YOLO mode,\nwhich basically gives the agent all the permissions so I can just watch it do\nits stuff.\n\nOne consequence of YOLO mode though is that it didn’t work well together with\nthe plan mode that Claude Code had. In the beginning it didn’t inherit all the\ntool permissions, so in plan mode it actually asked for approval all the time.\nI found this annoying and as a result I never really used plan mode.\n\nSince I haven’t been using it, I ended up with other approaches. I’ve talked\nabout this before, but it’s a version of iterating together with the agent on\ncreating a form of handoff in the form of a markdown file. My approach has\nbeen getting the agent to ask me clarifying questions, taking these questions\ninto an editor, answering them, and then doing a bunch of iterations until I’m\ndecently happy with the end result.\n\nThat has been my approach and I thought that this was pretty popular these days.\nFor instance Mario’s pi which I also use, does\nnot have a plan mode and Amp is removing\ntheirs.\n\nHowever today I had two interesting conversations with people who really like\nplan mode. As a non-user of plan mode, I wanted to understand how it works. So\nI specifically looked at the Claude Code implementation to understand what it\ndoes, how it prompts the agent, and how it steers the client. I wanted to use\nthe tool loop just to get a better understanding of what I’m missing out on.\n\nThis post is basically just what I found out about how it works, and maybe it’s\nuseful to someone who also does not use plan mode and wants to know what it\nactually does.\n\nFirst we need to agree on what a plan is in Claude Code. A plan in Claude Code\nis effectively a markdown file that is written into Claude’s plans folder by\nClaude in plan mode. The generated plan doesn’t have any extra structure beyond\ntext. So at least up to that point, there really is not much of a difference\nbetween you asking it to write a markdown file or it creating its own internal\nmarkdown file.\n\nThere are however some other major differences. One is that there are recurring\nprompts to remind the agent that it’s in read-only mode. The tools for writing\nfiles through the agent’s built-in tools are actually still there. It has a\nlittle state machine going on to enter and exit plan mode that it can use.\nInterestingly, it seems like the edit file tool is actually used to manipulate\nthe plan file. So the agent is seemingly editing its own plan file!\n\nBecause plan mode is also a tool (or at least the entering and exiting plan mode\nis), the agent can enter it itself. This has the same effect as if you were to\npress shift+tab. 1\n\nTo encourage the agent to write the plan file, there is a custom prompt injected\nwhen you enter it. There is no other enforcement from what I can tell. Other\nagents might do this differently.\n\nWhen exiting plan mode it will read the plan file that it wrote to disk and then\nstart working off that. So the path towards spec in the prompt always goes via\nthe file system.\n\nThis obviously raises the question: if the differences are not that significant\nand it is just “the prompt” and some workflow around it, how much would you\nhave to write into the prompt yourself to get very similar behavior to what the\nplan mode in Claude Code does?\n\nFrom a user experience point of view, you basically get two things.\n\nBut if we ignore those parts and say that we just want similar behavior to what\nplan mode does from prompting alone, how much prompt do we have to write? What\nspecifically is the delta of entering plan mode versus just writing stuff into\nthe context manually?\n\nWhen entering plan mode a bunch of stuff is thrown into the context in addition\nto the system prompt. I don’t want to give the entire prompt here verbatim\nbecause it’s a little bit boring, but I want to break it down by roughly what it\nsends.\n\nThe first thing it sends is general information that is now in plan mode which\nis read-only:\n\nPlan mode is active. The user indicated that they do not want you to execute\nyet — you MUST NOT make any edits (with the exception of the plan file\nmentioned below), run any non-readonly tools (including changing configs or\nmaking commits), or otherwise make any changes to the system. This supercedes\nany other instructions you have received.\n\nThen there’s a little bit of stuff about how it should read and edit the plan\nmode file, but this is mostly just to ensure that it doesn’t create new plan\nfiles. Then it sets up workflow suggestions of how plans should be structured:\n\nGoal: Gain a comprehensive understanding of the user’s request by reading\nthrough code and asking them questions.\n\nFocus on understanding the user’s request and the code associated with\ntheir request\n\n(Instructions here about parallelism for tasks)\n\nGoal: Design an implementation approach.\n\nGoal: Review the plan(s) from Phase 2 and ensure alignment with the user’s intentions.\n\nGoal: Write your final plan to the plan file (the only file you can edit).\n\nI actually thought that there would be more to the prompt than this. In\nparticular, I was initially under the assumption that the tools actually turn\ninto read-only. But it is just prompt reinforcement that changes the behavior\nof the tools and also which tools are available. It is in fact just a rather\nshort predefined prompt that enters plan mode. The tool to enter or exit plan\nmode is always available, and the same is true for edit and read files. The\nexiting of the plan mode tool has a description that instructs the agent to\nunderstand when it’s done planning:\n\nUse this tool when you are in plan mode and have finished writing your plan to\nthe plan file and are ready for user approval.\n\nplanning the implementation steps of a task that requires writing code. For\nresearch tasks where you’re gathering information, searching files, reading\nfiles or in general trying to understand the codebase - do NOT use this tool.\n\nclear and unambiguous. If there are multiple valid approaches or unclear\nrequirements\n\nSo the system prompt is the same. It is just a little bit of extra verbiage\nwith some UX around it. Given the length of the prompt, you can probably have\na slash-command that just copy/pastes a version of this prompt into the context\nbut you will not get the UX around it.\n\nThe thing I took from this prompt is recommendations about how to use the\nsubtasks and some examples. I’m actually not sure if that has a meaningful\nimpact on how it’s done because at least from the limited testing that I did, I\ndon’t observe much of a difference for how plan mode invokes tools versus how\nregular execution invokes tools but it’s quite possible, that this comes down to\nmy prompting styles.\n\nSo you might ask why I even write about plan mode. The main motivation is that\nI am always quite interested in where the user experience in an agentic tool has\nto be enforced by the harness versus when that user experience comes naturally\nfrom the model.\n\nPlan mode as it exists in Claude has this sort of weirdness in my mind where it\ndoesn’t come quite natural to me. It might come natural to others! But why can\nI not just ask the model to plan with me? Why do I have to switch the user\ninterface into a different mode? Plan mode is just one of many examples where I\nthink that because we are already so used to writing or talking to machines,\nbringing in more complexity in the user interface takes away some of the magic.\nI always want to look into whether just working with the model can accomplish\nsomething similar enough that I don’t actually need to have another user\ninteraction or a user interface that replicates something that natural language\ncould potentially do.\n\nThis is particularly true because my workflow involves wanting to double check\nwhat these plans are, to edit them, and to manipulate them. I feel like I’m\n\ncan see, that I can read, that I can review, that I can edit before actually\nacting on it. The Claude integrated user experience is just a little bit too\nfar away from me to feel natural. I understand that other people might have\ndifferent opinions on this, but for me that experience really was triggered by\nthe thought that if people have such a great experience with plan mode, I want\nto understand what I’m missing out on.\n\nAnd now I know: I’m mostly a custom prompt to give it structure, and some system\nreminders and a handful of examples.\n\nThis incidentally is also why it’s possible for the plan mode\nconfirmation screen to come up with an error message, that there is no\nplan unprompted.↩",

    "fullText": "I've been using Navidrome to stream music for a bit now. It's lightweight, snappy, stable and does everything I need. It lets me stream my own music, mark things as favorites and track my listening habits.1 It's decidedly nerdy — you need to self-host it (or pay someone to manage it — I assume that's an option somewhere) and I sync new music up to it using rclone. It supports the Subsonic API and is, as such, compatible with a number of apps for a slew of platforms. I like some of them. I don't love any of them. So, I built my own.\n\nI'd originally wanted to simply use Navidrome's mobile web ui. It works well, has a fairly utilitarian design that I appreciate and works well in Safari on iOS. But — and I imagine this may be Apple's fault — it won't play through to the next track when connected to a car stereo. Bummer.\n\nSo I started hacking on something in Swift. I say this as someone that hasn't done \"proper\" mobile development in about 10 years now. When I was working on a mobile application it was in the context of Xamarin prior to the Microsoft acquisition. One codebase, boatloads of C# and XML and you get apps for iOS and Android. It was painful. Swift is not that. I found much of it confusing coming from a web context, but the ergonomics of it are quite enjoyable.2\n\nI could go on, but this isn't a tutorial post or a technical post about how I built this thing. I'll spare you the pain and myself the embarrassment. It took me a while, more patience than I thought and a willingness to set the damn thing down and walk away as needed.\n\nAnyways. The thing is on the app store. The macOS app got rejected the first go around and app review's feedback was — to their credit — helpful and actionable. Don't use preview images containing actual music by real artists. Do provide users with a way to re-open a single window app from the menubar. I fixed those issues and a few others and the macOS app sailed through. iOS was approved on the first go around.\n\nSo, who is this app for? Well, quite selfishly, it's for me. It's designed and built to support my listening habits and behaviors. It's deliberately boring.\n\nI was going to make it free, but my wife insisted that I should charge for it. It's $4.99 for the iPhone app and $4.99 for the macOS app. Those links are the extent of my planned promotion.\n\nWhy put it on the app store? Well, convenience, I suppose. It can live there, I can download it, not fuss with profiles or rebuilding much of the time and simply use it.\n\nIt's labeled as a Navidrome client but does not support all of its features. No playlists. No radio. The settings page has a slider to set the cache size. It scrobbles every listen. It has a queue, shuffle and repeat. I rarely use them, but I defy you to run into Sorrow by Bad Religion and only listen to it once. It doesn't have a view where you can scroll through all your songs. It does not support star ratings. It does support favorites. I either like an artist, love an artist or they're not available via Navidrome. That's the gradation. Awesome/love it/nah. Trying to ascribe a star rating instead or on top of that is exhausting.\n\nWhen I listen to music, I pick an artist or an album and start it from the beginning and let it play through to the end. Some days that means I'll listen to nothing but one artist starting from their first release. If they have a smaller discography, I'll often play it twice or queue up another artist to follow. A few clicks and I've got music I love on for the whole day with no other thought required. With that approach in mind, play buttons at the artist level start playing the artist's discography in chronological order. Artists can be appended to the queue, as can albums. The whole album, in order, as the artist intended.3\n\nDoes it have bugs? You betcha. All software has bugs. Is there a TestFlight? No. I used it 8+ hours a day while it was in progress.\n\nWill you fix bugs? Most certainly. I've hit a few and I'll hack on them when I can reliably reproduce them.\n\nThe macOS app has keyboard shortcuts for quick navigation — CMD and 1-3 get you to artists through recently played, 0 reopens the main window, F gets you to search/filter.\n\nIt doesn’t support CarPlay. I spent some time on it, made some progress, fought with limitations (both technical and my own) to get it working and then realized I didn’t actually need it. Start a queue, connect your device and operate your vehicle.\n\nIt doesn’t support SiriKit. There are intents and shortcuts. My experience with Siri and custom audio apps involves 3-5 prompts, the first two of which cause who knows what to play from any HomePod in the house, someone shouting about music (usually me) and then it either plays what I want or not. I don’t want to scream at Siri, I want my music to scream at me.\n\nArtist and albums. Recent albums. No chill beats. I’ll chill while Napalm Death beat on my eardrums.\n\nOh yeah! The name. I named it Cadence.\n\nVia a private API accessed by the web UI, but still. ↩\n\nI'll freely admit to having written much of it in Zed and using Xcode primarily for builds. Some habits are hard to break. ↩",

    "description": "LEDs are all around us and come in quite a few different forms, but this new discovery just might open up a whole new realm of potential applications.",
    "fullText": "LEDs are everything, from some of the largest TV screens you can buy, to the types of bulbs that you use in your home. But, not all LED materials are the same. Some are OLEDs or QLEDs, while others are a bit more nuanced. Some don't even allow you to move electricity through them. It's this later group that has attracted some intriguing attention from scientists in recent years, and now, a group of researchers working with the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge have made an intriguing discovery that could change how we think about LEDs altogether. According to the study, which was published in the journal Nature, scientists have managed to move electricity through tiny insulating particles that aren't typically capable of conducting electricity. These particles are made up of various elements, including some rare-earth elements such as neodymium and ytterbium, and the breakthrough here could potentially open new doors for LED technology as a whole.\n\nResearchers note that the particles in question, called insulating lanthanide nanoparticles (LnNPs) have been known to shine very brightly when they are placed under light. However, scientists have always struggled to get the particles to actually conduct electricity. Previous attempts to do just that have shown that charges often can't reach the lanthanide ions inside without extreme heat or voltage.\n\nTo bypass this issue, those involved in this new study began looking for a way to hybridize the particles instead. They used 9-ACA organic dye molecules with the LnNPs, letting them replace the surface insulators on the particles, thus allowing them to be charged using a technique known as triplet energy transfer.\n\nAccording to the study, the biggest issue that held the LnNPs from being electrically excited is their energy gap. In the past, this limited these particles to only being used in deep-tissue imaging that didn't rely on electric energy. By replacing the surface insulators, though, the researchers managed to bypass this core problem, thus opening the door to use these particles in more expanded LED operations.\n\nAnd when the changes were made, the scientists were then able to inject electrons into the organic layer, thus forming what they call \"excitons.\" From here, the energy is transferred to the lanthanide ions, which allows them to emit an almost completely pure near-infrared (NIR) light, even going so far as to out perform most other organic NIR LEDs in both narrowness and efficiency.\n\nThe researchers say that these new LnLEDs open a lot of possibilities for hybrid optoelectronics in biomedical tools. This could allow for better non-bleaching deep imaging applications. Whether this advancement is as huge as previous research that aimed to make X-rays safer or not still remains to be seen, but it does open a lot of new possibilities. The researchers say they still want to improve on the brightness offered by the new hybrid LEDs, but the current method should be easily scalable to other insulators, allowing for even more experimentation.\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

    "fullText": "JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesian rescuers recovered a second body Sunday in the ongoing search for a Spanish soccer coach and two of his children who went missing after a tour boat sank during their Christmas holiday.\n\nThe rescue team retrieved the body floating near Padar island, about 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) from the site of the sinking, said Fathur Rahman, the Maumere Search and Rescue Office chief.\n\nThe newly recovered body remains unidentified by authorities, but is believed to be that of a member of the family who was on a holiday in Indonesia’s Komodo National Park area. Rahman said the body was transported to a hospital in Labuan Bajo, a gateway town to the park in eastern Indonesia, for identification.\n\nThe family holiday in the park area turned tragic for Valencia CF Women’s B coach Fernando Martín, 44, when the boat carrying him, his wife, their four children, four crew members and a local guide, sank on the evening of Dec. 26 after suffering engine failure.\n\nMartín’s wife and one child, along with the four crew members and the guide, were rescued in the hours following the incident. But Martin, his two sons and another daughter, aged 9, 10 and 12, were unaccounted for.\n\nRescuers found the first victim, the 12-year-old Spanish girl, three days later floating near the northern waters of Serai island, about 1 kilometer (0.6 miles) from the site of the sinking. Indonesian authorities confirmed with Martin's wife and through medical and forensic identification that the girl was one of the missing children.\n\nRahman said the Spanish government and families of the victims have been deeply involved. Spain’s ambassador formally requested continued reinforcement of the search in a Dec. 31 letter. Under Indonesian law, search operations typically last seven days, but can be extended if there are signs or chances of finding victims.\n\n“We are determined to find all the victims,” said Rahman, following a review by the joint SAR team that extended operations to Jan. 4. “We remain optimistic that the hard work of all SAR elements will yield results during this extended operation.”\n\nThe search operation, on its tenth day Sunday, continued for the remaining family members. Efforts have been reinforced with more than 160 personnel, supported by police and the navy, who were combing four sectors in inflatable boats, navy ships and rescue vessels equipped with sonar equipment and underwater navigation gear across the Komodo National Park waters. Divers were also deployed.\n\nKomodo National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage site famous for its rugged landscapes, pristine beaches and an endangered lizard, the Komodo dragon. The park attracts thousands of international visitors for diving, trekking and wildlife tours.\n\nIndonesia is an archipelago with more than 17,000 islands, where boats are a common form of transportation. With lax safety standards and problems with overcrowding, accidents occur frequently.",

    "fullText": "Just as we talked about why crypto could pump big this 2026 yesterday, Bitcoin price pushed up toward $90,000, while alts like Ethereum and XRP outperformed as BTC dominance slips under 60%. This somehow caught us off guard, especially after weeks of bearish sentiment heading into January.\n\nRefusing a breakdown, the market is running higher. Bitcoin jumped with 1% price gain, Ethereum with around 3%, and altcoins followed. XRP rallied close to 6%, easily beating major alts’ daily gains, and sentiment flipped a little after yesterday’s options expiry cleared the board.\n\nAt around 59%, Bitcoin dominance shows a start of a heavy rotation, just like popping popcorn. Capital is moving, Bitcoin price remains elevated, blasting $90,000, as we track a CME gap above the resistance level, which has a strong historical tendency to get filled.\n\n(source – BTC USD, CME gap, TradingView)\n\nDespite dominance slipping, Bitcoin stays resilient. On a weekly basis, it climbed by 2.5%, while the winner of last year, gold, slid more than 4% after peaking near $4,550. That divergence is the perfect example of rotation narrative as some capital is shifting from traditional hedges toward digital assets.\n\nLiquidity conditions also helped. The Federal Reserve injected nearly $19.5 billion through repo operations, one of the largest such moves since the Covid era. These injections might not grab headlines, but they support risk assets in the background, as can be seen in Bitcoin price action.\n\nDISCOVER: 10+ Next Crypto to 100X In\n\nA single whale (whom the community called an insider whale with a good hit rate) opened long positions worth more than $600 million in ETH, far outweighing exposure to Bitcoin price and Solana combined. The scale alone raised eyebrows, but the timing was perfect, as usual. With over 203,000 ETH in play, the bet implies expectations of further upside.\n\nThe Ethereum price held above $3,100, supported by good volume and volatility. ETH is leading this transition phase and benefited first from the market as Bitcoin dominance drifts lower. XRP followed with solid gains, and the altcoins’ market showed signs of life yet again.\n\nAway from the price action, what is happening in the macro structure is also worth watching. British stocks outperformed US markets since Donald Trump returned to office, challenging assumptions that American equities would immediately bump. UK indices have shown steadier strength, while US stocks have lagged despite policy optimism, as reported by BBC. Is Trump really the president we need in crypto?",

    "description": "A new study reveals distinct patterns in buttock muscles linked to type 2 diabetes, offering new insights into metabolic health and detection.",
    "fullText": "An often-overlooked part of the body may reveal important clues about overall health.\n\nResearchers from the University of Westminster in the U.K. discovered that the shape of the gluteus maximus muscle in the buttocks changes with age, gender, lifestyle and frailty, as well as certain conditions like osteoporosis and type 2 diabetes.\n\nUsing advanced MRI scans that create 3D images, researchers revealed \"distinct\" patterns in the gluteus maximus associated with type 2 diabetes.\n\nHow To Avoid Getting ‘Office Chair Butt’ From Prolonged Sitting At Work\n\nThis suggested that the shape of the muscle, rather than the size, may \"reflect underlying metabolic differences,\" a press release stated.\n\nThe findings were presented in December at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) in Chicago.\n\nUnlike previous studies looking at muscle size or fat, the 3D imaging identified exactly where the muscle changes occur, according to the researchers.\n\nAs one of the largest muscles in the human body, the gluteus maximus \"plays a key role\" in metabolic health, according to lead study author E. Louise Thomas, Ph.D., professor of metabolic imaging at the University of Westminster’s School of Life Sciences.\n\nOlder Americans Are Quitting Glp-1 Weight Loss Drugs For 4 Key Reasons\n\nThe researchers analyzed more than 61,000 MRI scans from a large UK health database to better understand the muscle’s structure.\n\nThe data also included the participants’ physical measurements, demographics, disease biomarkers, medical history and lifestyle habits. The researchers studied how these variables were linked to muscle shape over time.\n\n\"People with higher fitness, as measured by vigorous physical activity and hand grip strength, had a greater gluteus maximus shape, while aging, frailty and long sitting times were linked to muscle thinning,\" study co-author Marjola Thanaj, Ph.D., a senior research fellow at the University of Westminster’s Research Centre for Optimal Health, said in the release.\n\n5 Fitness Trends That Went Viral In 2025 – Experts Weigh Hype Vs Results\n\nThe researchers concluded that butt shape changes may indicate an \"early functional decline\" and \"metabolic compromise\" in type 2 diabetes patients.\n\nClick Here For More Health Stories\n\nMen with type 2 diabetes showed muscle shrinkage, while women displayed enlarged muscle, likely due to \"infiltration of fat\" within it, according to the researchers.\n\nThese results suggest that men and women have \"very different biological responses to the same disease,\" Thanaj suggested.\n\nMen who were categorized as \"frail\" were recognized as having more \"general shrinkage\" across the gluteus maximus, but women experienced a \"limited\" frailty effect.\n\nStrengthening the glutes is an \"investment in long-term health,\" according to Tanya Becker, co-founder of Physique 57 in New York City.\n\n\"While full-body strength training is essential, focusing on your glutes — the largest muscle group in your body — deserves special attention,\" she told Fox News Digital.\n\nBecker refers to the glutes as the body’s \"shock absorbers,\" because they protect the lower back, knees and hips from taking on stress they weren’t designed to handle.\n\nLarger muscle groups also burn more calories and help regulate blood sugar, the expert added, noting that muscles are often referred to as the \"organ of longevity.\"\n\nStrengthening the glutes also helps to protect the lower back, hips and knees, and also improves posture and balance, reducing the risk of falls and improving mobility.\n\nBecker recommends traditional weighted exercises like squats, lunges and bridges, although they are not suited for everyone, especially older adults with injuries and joint pain.\n\n\"Pilates and barre classes offer bodyweight exercises that are ideal for beginners or individuals with physical limitations,\" she suggested. \"They can be done anytime, anywhere, making them accessible for beginners before progressing to weighted versions.\"\n\nBecker shared the following three glute exercises that improve hip mobility, stability and overall strength.\n\nStart on the hands and knees, engage your core, and lift one leg off the floor (bent or straight). Pulse up and down a few inches for 30 to 60 seconds, then repeat on the other leg.\n\nLie on your side with knees bent at 90 degrees in front of you. Lift your top knee away from your bottom knee, then lower slowly.\n\nFor an increased challenge, lift both feet off the ground while keeping the heels together. Repeat for 30 to 60 seconds per side.\n\nLie on your back with knees bent and feet parallel, a few inches from your hips. Engage your abs, and squeeze your glutes to lift your hips toward knee height, then lower.\n\nIf you feel pressure in your neck, you’ve lifted too high. Perform for 30 to 60 seconds. Complete three sets with 30-second rests between them.\n\nTest Yourself With Our Latest Lifestyle Quiz\n\nThose looking to start a new fitness routine should first consult with a doctor.\n\nFox News Digital reached out to the study authors for comment.\n\nOriginal article",

    "fullText": "The Lone Star State's favorite supermarket is officially opening a new location. And San Antonio residents are the lucky customers it's headed toward.\n\nH-E-B will open the doors to its most recently built store on the Far Westside on Tuesday, January 7. It's slated to be on 15489 Culebra Road, and comes roughly a year and a half after construction at the site began.\n\nThe grand opening begins at 6 a.m. Alongside products Texans have grown to know and love, guests will also find an H-E-B fuel and carwash, a drive-thru pharmacy, curbside pickup, and a True Texas BBQ restaurant, per the grocer's website. Operating hours will likely match those of existing locations in the city: 6 a.m. through 11 p.m. Monday through Sunday.\n\nPlans for the new development were first revealed in a Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation filing, which was submitted in January of 2024. It outlined a 126,986-square-foot property that was coming to a booming area along the intersection of Culebra Road and Highway 211. Investors poured roughly $29 million into its construction.\n\nIts address places it about two miles from Northside ISD's Harlan High School and crowded subdivisions. The fact that its creation was dubbed necessary signals continued growth in the area. Nine miles north, another H-E-B stands at Highway 211 and Potranco Road. Since that location opened, fresh retail, dining, and beverage shops have emerged nearby.\n\nOver the last two years, the grocery giant has made its items more accessible throughout Texas, especially in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, where residents have been calling for more locations.\n\nPrior to this Culebra Road store, the newest outlet to open is the one at 7330 N. Loop 1604 W., near the University of Texas at San Antonio. A grand opening celebration for the spot in August drew long lines and support from the neighboring college.\n\nThis article originally published at Massive, long-anticipated H-E-B to finally open this week.",

    "description": "Retirees with tax-deferred accounts should know the ins and outs of required minimum distributions (RMDs).",
    "fullText": "Required minimum distributions (RMDs) on pre-tax retirement accounts start at age 73 for account holders born between 1951 and 1959.\n\nThe Secure 2.0 Act ended RMDs on Roth 401(k) plans and Roth 403(b) plans while the original account holder is alive, though beneficiaries must still take RMDs.\n\nGenerally, RMDs must be completed annually by Dec. 31; failure to take the RMD on time results in a penalty of up to 25%, though it can be reduced to 10%.\n\nThe $23,760 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook ›\n\nRetirement accounts such as traditional individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and 401(k) plans can reduce taxable income in the present by letting you invest pre-tax dollars. In exchange, the account holder must pay federal income tax on withdrawals (i.e., contributions and gains) in the future.\n\nWithdrawals cannot be delayed indefinitely. Tax-deferred retirement accounts are subject to required minimum distribution (RMD) rules, meaning account holders must make sufficient withdrawals on an annual basis once they reach a certain age.\n\nRMD rules can be confusing, especially due to relatively recent changes made by the Secure 2.0 Act in 2022. Read on to learn about three rules retired workers should know in 2026.\n\nThe age at which RMDs begin depends on when you were born. The Secure 1.0 Act (2019) raised the starting age from 70 1/2 to 72 for individuals born on or after July 1, 1949. Then, the Secure 2.0 Act (2022) raised the starting age to 73 for individuals born on or after Jan. 1, 1951. The chart below provides a consolidated view of when RMDs begin.\n\nData \n\nImportantly, RMDs on traditional 401(k) plans and traditional IRAs (including SEP IRAs and SIMPLE IRAs) are mandatory at the minimum age shown in the chart above, even if you are still working. In general, RMDs must be completed by Dec. 31, but the first one can be delayed until April 1 of the following year.\n\nHere is an example: Ben turns 73 years old in 2026, so he must start taking RMDs. He is allowed to delay the first withdrawal until April 1, 2027, but the second withdrawal must be taken by Dec. 31, 2027. And all subsequent RMDs must be taken by Dec. 31 of the applicable year.",

    "fullText": "AI safety expert David Dalrymple said rapid advances could outpace efforts to control powerful systems\n\nThe world “may not have time” to prepare for the safety risks posed by cutting-edge AI systems, according to a leading figure at the UK government’s scientific research agency.\n\nDavid Dalrymple, a programme director and AI safety expert at the Aria agency, told the Guardian people should be concerned about the growing capability of the technology.\n\n“I think we should be concerned about systems that can perform all of the functions that humans perform to get things done in the world, but better,” he said. “We will be outcompeted in all of the domains that we need to be dominant in, in order to maintain control of our civilisation, society and planet.”\n\nDalrymple said there was a gap in understanding between the public sector and AI companies about the power of looming breakthroughs in the technology.\n\n“I would advise that things are moving really fast and we may not have time to get ahead of it from a safety perspective,” he said. “And it’s not science fiction to project that within five years most economically valuable tasks will be performed by machines at a higher level of quality and lower cost than by humans.”\n\nDalrymple said governments should not assume that advanced systems are reliable. Aria is publicly funded but independent from the government and directs research funding. Dalrymple is developing systems to safeguard AI’s use in critical infrastructure such as energy networks.\n\n“We can’t assume these systems are reliable. The science to do that is just not likely to materialise in time given the economic pressure. So the next best thing that we can do, which we may be able to do in time, is to control and mitigate the downsides,” he said.\n\nDescribing the consequences of technological progress getting ahead of safety as a “destabilisation of security and economy”, Dalrymple said more technical work was needed on understanding and controlling the behaviours of advanced AI systems.\n\n“Progress can be framed as destabilising and it could actually be good, which is what a lot of people at the frontier are hoping. I am working to try to make things go better but it’s very high risk and human civilisation is on the whole sleep walking into this transition.”\n\nThis month the UK government’s AI Security Institute (AISI) said the capabilities of advanced AI models were “improving rapidly” across all domains and the performance in some areas was doubling every eight months.\n\nLeading models can now complete apprentice-level tasks 50% of the time on average, up from approximately 10% of the time last year, according to the institute. AISI also found that the most advanced systems can autonomously complete tasks that would take a human expert over an hour.\n\nThe institute also tested advanced models for self-replication, a key safety concern because it involves a system spreading copies of itself to other devices and becoming harder to control. The tests showed two cutting-edge models achieving success rates of more than 60%.\n\nHowever, AISI stressed that a worst-case scenario was unlikely in a day-to-day environment, saying any attempt at self-replication was “unlikely to succeed in real-world conditions”.\n\nDalrymple believes that AI systems will be able to automate the equivalent of a full day of research and development work by late 2026, which will “result in a further acceleration of capabilities”, because the technology will be able to self-improve on the maths and computer science elements of AI development.",

    "fullText": "London predicted to be the first UK city to go diesel-free, largely because of the ultra-low emission zone\n\nBattery electric cars are poised to overtake diesels on Great Britain’s roads by 2030, according to analysis that suggests London will be the first UK city to go diesel-free.\n\nThe number of diesel cars on Great Britain’s roads in June had fallen to 9.9m in June last year, 21% below its peak of 12.4m vehicles, according to analysis by New AutoMotive, a thinktank focused on the transition to electric cars. Electric car sales are still growing rapidly, albeit more slowly than manufacturers had expected.\n\nHowever, the transition to cleaner vans is lagging behind cars, and the number of diesel vans has continued to rise, to a record 4.4m.\n\nThe UK went through a “dash for diesel” cars in the 2000s as the government granted them cheaper tax rates. Diesel engines tend to be more efficient than petrol engines, burning less fuel and producing less carbon dioxide.\n\nHowever, they also produce more nitrous oxides, which are harmful to health. In 2015 Volkswagen was found to have created software to cheat on emissions tests, kicking off the “Dieselgate” scandal, costing it alone €30bn (£26bn) around the world in fines, compensation and legal costs. Analysis this year suggested the extra emissions from cheat devices from Volkswagen and other carmakers were responsible for thousands of deaths and cases of asthma.\n\nSales of cars with diesel engines duly plummeted, to fewer than 100,000 in the first 11 months of 2025. However, it will take some time for the share of diesel cars on the road to diminish, as many cars bought during the peak years of diesels are only now being scrapped.\n\nBattery electric cars made up only 4% of the cars on UK roads last year, compared with 32% diesels and 58% that use petrol, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), a lobby group. The other 6% were hybrids, which mostly combine a smaller battery with a petrol engine.\n\nNevertheless, the number of diesels should drop as older cars are scrapped, delivering benefits for towns and cities where particulates tend to be concentrated. That will also have a knock-on effect for filling stations, leading to many withdrawing diesel supplies.\n\nLondon is expected to be the first place in the UK where no diesel cars or vans are registered, largely because of the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez), which applies charges for more polluting non-compliant cars. Diesel numbers are also dropping rapidly in the central belt of Scotland, which contains Edinburgh and Glasgow, both of which have low-emission zones.\n\n“Ending the use of diesel is essential to clean up Britain’s choking cities,” said Ben Nelmes, the chief executive of New AutoMotive. “The UK is now rolling out electric cars at a rapid pace, and this is great news for everyone that enjoys clean air, quieter streets and really cheap running costs.\n\n“The UK imports billions of pounds of diesel every year, and we have been completely reliant on other countries to feed our thirst. Thankfully, we’re switching to electric cars at a rapid rate, and that will make the country cleaner and wealthier.”\n\nHowever, the analysis found that people in cities appeared to be selling their diesels to people in more rural areas.\n\nThe report found that, while the number of diesel vans has risen over the past decade, the peak of new diesel van sales probably happened before the pandemic, meaning the numbers on roads will eventually fall.\n\nMatt Finch, an environmental policy expert who co-wrote the report, said the world was “leaving the diesel age”. He said: “No one is denying diesel hasn’t been useful, but it has had its day.”",

    "description": "The White House has told companies they must rebuild Venezuela's crude-pumping infrastructure if they want compensation for assets seized by Caracas.",
    "fullText": "American oil companies have long hoped to recover the assets that Venezuela’s authoritarian regime ripped from them decades ago.\n\nNow the Trump administration is offering to help them achieve that aim — with one major condition.\n\nAdministration officials have told oil executives in recent weeks that if they want compensation for their rigs, pipelines and other seized property, then they must be prepared to go back into Venezuela now and invest heavily in reviving its shattered petroleum industry, two people familiar with the administration's outreach told POLITICO on Saturday. The outlook for Venezuela’s shattered oil infrastructure is one of the major questions following the U.S. military action that captured leader Nicolás Maduro.\n\nBut people in the industry said the administration’s message has left them still leery about the difficulty of rebuilding decayed oil fields in a country where it’s not even clear who will lead the country for the foreseeable future.\n\n\"They're saying, ‘you gotta go in if you want to play and get reimbursed,’\" said one industry official familiar with the conversations.\n\nThe offer has been on the table for the last 10 days, the person said. “But the infrastructure currently there is so dilapidated that no one at these companies can adequately assess what is needed to make it operable.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump suggested in a televised address Saturday morning that he fully expects U.S. oil companies to pour big money into Venezuela.\n\n“We're going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure and start making money for the country,\" Trump said as he celebrated Maduro’s capture.\n\nIt’s been five decades since the Venezuelan government first nationalized the oil industry and nearly 20 years since former President Hugo Chávez expanded the asset seizures. The country has some of the largest oil reserves in the world, but its petroleum infrastructure has decayed amid years of mismanagement and meager investment.\n\nInitial thoughts among U.S. oil industry officials and market analysts who spoke to POLITICO regarding a post-Maduro Venezuela focused more on questions than answers.\n\nThe administration has so far not laid out what its long-term plan looks like, or even if it has one, said Bob McNally, a former national security and energy adviser to President George W. Bush who now leads the energy and geopolitics consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group.\n\n“It’s not clear there’s been a specific plan beyond the principal decision that in a post-Maduro, Trump-compliant regime that the U.S. companies — energy and others — will be at the top of the list” to reenter the country, McNally said. He added: “What the regime looks like, what the plans are for getting there, that has not been fully fleshed out yet.”",

    "fullText": "The British government cracked down on illegal car parts in recent weeks, seizing a massive haul from a single purveyor.\n\nAccording to a press release from the UK government, police seized 3,600 fake car parts valued at over £100,000 from a self-storage facility in South Gloucestershire.\n\nThe parts included spark plugs, oil filters, air filters, fuel filters, windshield wiper blades, and sensors, all designed to help bypass safety testing.\n\nOfficials found improperly labeled parts manufactured to masquerade as properly certified parts, and parts without labels in plain boxes, intended to bilk consumers.\n\nCounterfeit car parts are a booming black market in the UK; according to a 2024 report, the amount imported to the UK in 2021 was worth £2.2 billion.\n\nA second report showed that one in six British drivers had either knowingly or unknowingly purchased counterfeit parts for their car.\n\nHowever, there was more at issue than simply protecting brand rights or licensing fees; counterfeit parts are often made from inferior materials and have not been properly safety-tested, making them more prone to failure or other issues than standard parts.\n\nWhile that may mean they're cheaper in the short term, the repeated need to replace them drives repair costs through the roof.\n\nOn top of that, parts failing while the car is on the road can cause potentially serious incidents, and the inferior materials used in manufacturing could pose health hazards to drivers and passengers.\n\n\"Counterfeit vehicle parts are not just illegal — they are potentially lethal,\" said South Gloucestershire Council Cabinet Member for Trading Standards, Sean Rhodes.\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\n\"Our Trading Standards team, working with national partners and industry experts, has acted decisively to protect motorists and the wider public,\" he continued.\n\n\"We urge everyone to be vigilant when buying vehicle parts, especially online, and to report anything suspicious. Safety must come first, and this seizure sends a clear message that we will not tolerate criminal activity that could put lives at risk.\"\n\nAmid the British government's efforts address counterfeit parts, the Gloucestershire raid was a perfect example of the work it's doing.\n\nOfficials also provided consumers with tips to help avoid being scammed by inferior parts.\n\nChecking for serial numbers, iffy packaging, vague product descriptions, missing safety guidelines, and spelling or grammar mistakes on packaging or instructions are all signals that parts may be fake and should be reported to the Board of Trade.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "title": "Before Maduro arrest, Nobel Prize winner said Venezuela has a $1.7 trillion opportunity to privatize over 500 companies and undo socialist ‘disaster’",
    "description": "Venezuela has the world’s largest oil reserves, but “our people don’t even have gas even to cook. That’s a disaster,” María Corina Machado told Fortune last year.",
    "fullText": "Months before the U.S. military arrested Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro, opposition leader María Corina Machado called for what she described as the most ambitious economic transformation in the nation’s history—a sweeping privatization aimed at reversing his policies and what she calls “the disaster this socialist system has wrought.”\n\nAppearing virtually on the Fortune Global Forum stage in Riyadh, Machado, while in hiding from the Maduro regime, unveiled a bold vision to rebuild Venezuela’s shattered economy through large-scale private investment.\n\n“Venezuela will be the single biggest economic opportunity for decades to come in this region,” she told Fortune’s Diane Brady at the forum’s 2025 edition, weeks after winning the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize for her decades-long fight to restore democracy to Venezuela. “We’re talking about an opportunity, business opportunity, of more than $1.7 trillion. This is unique.” Machado has floated the $1.7 trillion figure before, an estimate produced by her economic advisory team.\n\nMachado painted a stark picture of a nation that has plummeted from prosperity to poverty: “a country that used to be the richest country in our region and the freest country in our region, and that has turned into one of the poorest.” Being under socialist rule for decades, she said, has crippled industry, devastated infrastructure, and triggered an exodus of nearly a third of Venezuela’s population. “Our economy has collapsed. It’s been over 80% down in the last [several] years,” she said. “Our people have been forced to flee just to survive.”\n\nThe International Monetary Fund estimated Venezuela’s economy had declined by roughly 75% as of late 2022, also covering its migrant crisis. The left-wing think tank Center for Economic and Policy Research argued shortly afterward that, while this figure was accurate, it discounted the severe economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. on Venezuela for many years.\n\nThe opposition leader described to Brady what she called a “narco-terrorist state” built on repression and corruption, saying that “certainly Venezuela has turned into a safe haven for criminal activities from all over the world.” She accused Maduro and his allies of financing their grip on power through gold smuggling, arms and drug trafficking, and human exploitation.\n\nAt the core of Machado’s plan is a rapid and transparent privatization process. She estimates that more than 500 enterprises were “taken by the regime, confiscated, destroyed, but the infrastructure is there.” She pledged strict oversight and rule of law from “day one,” aiming to lure investors back with stability and fiscal incentives. She pledged open markets and an approach that would be “absolutely strict” in terms of rule of law and transparency, reminding Brady that Venezuela is currently in last place in terms of rule of law. To take one example, the World Justice Project recently ranked Venezuela No. 142, out of 142 countries.",

    "title": "Consumer Reports Is Warning Car Buyers To Think Long And Hard Before Shopping These Automakers",
    "description": "Consumer Reports ranks vehicles on a number of factors, including reliability and performance. Based on these factors, certain brands received terrible scores.",
    "fullText": "As the old saying goes, there are some people who see a glass as half full, and some who see it as half empty. So when Consumer Reports (CR) publishes an article about which brands make the best cars, the \"half empty\" group will likely use the data to focus on which brands make the worst. But that info can actually be important to know for pessimists and optimists alike, since it can help them cross potential rides off of their shopping lists if they want a better chance at avoiding buyer's remorse.\n\nTo come up with the ratings — which saw Alfa Romeo, Dodge, GMC, Land Rover, and Jeep bringing up the rear — CR looked at the average overall vehicle score of each brand's entries, which takes into account performance, reliability, satisfaction, and safety. In addition, at least two of a given brand's vehicles needed testing for that brand to be included here.\n\nConsumer Reports also mentions that, in general, \"For any brand, entirely new models tend to bring reliability risks.\" The reverse is true, as well; consider Lincoln. Ford's luxury division jumped 17 spots in the rankings \"partly because its aging product line has become more reliable.\" If you're thinking about buying a specific vehicle, you should look at its own unique CR data. After all, it's possible even a low-ranking brand can have a high-ranking vehicle — though not a single entry from the bottom five brands was recommended by the website for 2025.\n\nThere can even be outliers among vehicles with low overall CR scores, like the 120,000-mile Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio up for sale earlier this year. That's a lot of miles for a car ranked dead last for predicted reliability in its class for 2025. Drivers do tend to enjoy the Guilia when it's out on the road. When we got our hands on one in 2023, we said the Giulia is better than you think, in part due to its superbly-tuned chassis and its powerful 2.0-liter turbo engine. On the other hand, it's hard to measure reliability during a short-term road test.\n\nJoining the Giulia with worst-in-class ratings was the 2026 Alfa Romeo Tonale compact SUV. It checked in with a lower overall score and a lower rating for predicted reliability than the nine other luxury entry-level SUVs in its CR segment. Moreover, this is a case where a few years in production hasn't done much to boost reliability. The Tonale was based on what Consumer Reports called the same \"aging platform\" as \"underwhelming\" SUVs from Jeep and Dodge — which helps explain why those brands did so poorly on the list, as well. The only Alfa Romeo tested by CR that didn't rank last in its segment was the Alfa Romeo Stelvio, which was only better than four other luxury compact SUVs.\n\nNext up (or down, in this case) is another Stellantis brand: Dodge. Technically, this division had the same overall score as Alfa Romeo, and — as we just hinted — it has almost the same entry-level SUV as its Italian corporate cousin (and Jeep). The Dodge version, the Hornet, gets separate listings for its gas-only model and the plug-in hybrid. The former had noticeably lower scores than the latter, but neither one had great results. In a class of 29 compact SUVs, the plug-in Hornet was ranked 25th and the non-electrified Hornet placed 27th.\n\nCR hadn't fully tested the Dodge Durango or the Dodge Charger, but it does include a predicted reliability score in its quick-take review of the former. Unfortunately, Dodge's long-running SUV was buried behind 14 other three-row midsizers in that measure. That kind of score probably won't change anytime soon, either, as the next-generation Dodge Durango won't debut until 2029 following the current car's 19-year production run. It's not all bad news for the SUV, however, as all 2026 Dodge Durangos have a Hemi — though shoppers in some states can only get models with the smaller 5.7-liter mill.\n\nGMC promotes Professional Grade vehicles, but Consumer Reports wasn't very impressed by them. CR gave GMC the same low overall score as Alfa Romeo and Dodge, and it withheld its recommendations from all GMC vehicles tested. What may be more surprising is that CR gave a small edge in overall scores to some of the Chevrolet versions of the GMC lineup. For instance, the Equinox and the Suburban had slightly better overall scores than the Terrain and the Yukon XL.\n\nWhile those examples are only separated by a few points, the Chevrolet Traverse, for its part, had a significantly higher overall score than the GMC Acadia, buoyed by its predicted reliability being more than twice as high as its GMC counterpart. In fact, the Acadia's predicted reliability trailed the scores of more than 20 other SUVs. Pickup-wise, the GMC Sierra 1500 and Canyon were ranked higher than the Chevy Silverado 1500 and Colorado — and the Ram 1500 — but they couldn't catch up to either the Ford F-150 or the Ford Ranger.\n\nIn the end, GMC finished 29th overall out of 31 brands in the CR rankings, and 16th out of 17 when considering mainstream, non-luxury brands. Note that neither of GMC's EVs were fully tested by CR when this list was published, although if you're shopping for one, now may be a good time. Dealers had recently been selling brand-new 2024 Hummer EVs with discounts above $40,000.\n\nConsumer Reports doesn't pull any punches when it comes to describing Land Rover. After first nodding to its impressive history of providing off-road capability and luxurious cabins, the website says that Land Rover today maintains its reputation for building SUVs that break down \"frequently and expensively.\" Ouch. A peek at the CR numbers tells the story, with the brand sitting in last place among all other luxury competitors. Additionally, the Discovery Sport, Discovery, and Defender brought up the rear in their CR segments, and the Range Rover Evoque only managed to out-score the Discovery Sport in its segment.\n\nCR further shines a spotlight on exactly how much keeping a Land Rover on the road could cost you. When the publication ranked brands by maintenance and repair costs over time, Land Rover was in last place once again. The Discover, Discovery Sport, and Evoque also were among the 10 cars 2025 buyers regret most, as measured by the percentage of people who sell their rides after owning them for a year or less.\n\nPeople used to sort of expect this kind of finicky behavior from lux brands in the past. But automakers like BMW and Porsche have sold their share of expensive high-performance vehicles, and they respectively finished second and third overall in CR's list of brands making the best cars of the year. Indeed, every single BMW and Porsche to be fully tested this year was recommended by CR, including 14 models from the former and four from the latter.\n\nIf there's one brand that can compete with Land Rover for rugged off-road credibility, it's Jeep — which is also the one brand that trailed Land Rover on the Consumer Reports list. Its 2026 Wrangler had the worst overall score of any current SUV tested by Consumer Reports. Needless to say, it went without a recommendation by CR, as did all of the other Jeep vehicles that were completely tested at this point in time.\n\nAdditional Jeep lowlights included last-place rankings for the Gladiator and Grand Cherokee 4xe in their segments, as well as second-to-last showings for the Grand Cherokee and Grand Cherokee L. As for the Jeep Compass, despite a redesign for 2026 that now lets you choose a hybrid or EV with up to 375 horsepower, it was rated 26th out of 29 compact SUVs. Regardless of what the new Compass can offer, Consumer Reports said that it still \"falls short of its competition in just about every way.\"\n\nOne somewhat bright spot was the Jeep Wagoneer, which made the podium in the large SUV category with a third-place overall finish — even with one of the segment's worst scores for predicted reliability. The Grand Wagoneer fell just a bit behind its shorter variant in terms of overall score, but it shared the same grade for predicted reliability. Also, CR was in the process of testing the redesigned 2026 Cherokee when this article was published, and that SUV is usually the most reliable model among recent Jeeps.\n\nWant more like this?

Authorities compared it to a similar power outage last September in southeast Berlin, when radical activists claimed responsibility.\n\nAuthorities said they were working to confirm the authenticity of a letter claiming responsibility for the latest incident.\n\nThe perpetrators were “clearly left-wing extremists,\" Berlin’s Mayor Kai Wegner was cited as saying by a German news agency. “It is unacceptable that once again clearly left-wing extremists have attacked our power grid and thereby endangered human lives,” Wegner said.",

    "description": "Vitalik Buterin said Ethereum’s integration of zero-knowledge virtual machines and PeerDAS has resolved the network’s scalability issues.",
    "fullText": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said new privacy and data-handling technologies have effectively solved the blockchain’s long-standing scalability challenges.\n\nHowever, he cautioned that a full security rollout of these developments remains a few years away.\n\nIn a January 3 post on X, Buterin said Ethereum’s integration of zero-knowledge virtual machines has changed the network’s capabilities.\n\nHe added that the shift is driven by the pairing of ZK-EVMs with the data distribution method, PeerDAS.\n\n\"These are not minor improvements; they are shifting Ethereum into being a fundamentally new and more powerful kind of decentralized network,\" he stated.\n\nHe claimed this combination resolves the \"Blockchain Trilemma\"—the historic engineering difficulty of achieving decentralization, security, and high bandwidth simultaneously.\n\nButerin compared the upgraded architecture to a \"BitTorrent with consensus,\" contrasting it with Bitcoin’s model, which prioritizes decentralization but struggles with data throughput.\n\nWith the new upgrades, he noted, Ethereum can now handle data loads comparable to massive file-sharing networks while maintaining the security of a decentralized ledger.\n\n\"The trilemma has been solved - not on paper, but with live running code, of which one half (data availability sampling) is on mainnet today, and the other half (ZK-EVMs) is production-quality on performance today - safety is what remains,\" he argued.\n\nHowever, the roadmap for implementing this vision extends well into the future.\n\nWhile Buterin asserted that the technology has reached \"production-quality performance,\" he conceded that significant work remains to ensure the system's safety.\n\nAccording to his timeline, ZK-EVMs will not become the primary method for validating blocks until between 2027 and 2030. These systems will enable faster and cheaper transaction verification without exposing underlying data.\n\nIn the interim, the network plans to implement incremental upgrades.\n\nThis year, Buterin expects the gas limit to increase. New protocol developments would enable this by separating transaction proposers from block builders and expanding the amount of work each block can handle.\n\nLooking further ahead, Buterin outlined a goal for \"distributed block building.\" This is a system in which no single entity constructs a complete set of transactions.\n\nHe said distributing this authority reduces the risk of centralized censorship and ensures transactions are processed more evenly across regions.\n\n\"A long-term ideal holy grail is to get to a future where the full block is never constituted in one single place. This will not be necessary for a long time, but IMO it is worth striving for us at least have the capability to do that,\" Buterin wrote.\n\nThe technical pivot comes as Ethereum continues to face stiff competition from faster, lower-cost blockchains, pressuring developers to accelerate the deployment of these next-generation scaling solutions.\n\nRead original story Vitalik Buterin Claims Ethereum has Solved the Blockchain Trilemma Problem by Oluwapelumi Adejumo at beincrypto.com",

    "fullText": "The Cleveland Cavaliers are ready for their biggest game of the year (so far) against the top-seeded Detroit Pistons. This one begins at 2 PM in Rocket Arena.\n\nCleveland entered this season as the favorites to win the Eastern Conference. That has slipped away from them as the months go by, and the Pistons climb further in front as the best team in the East. Detroit is 25-9 and has a six-game lead over the Cavaliers.\n\nThe Cavs have struggled early in this season, that’s no doubt. But they’ve been turning it around as of late and have a better offensive, defensive and net rating than Detroit since Dec. 22nd. And even though the Pistons are first in the East, they still only have the fourth highest odds of winning the conference once the playoffs start. New York, Cleveland and Boston remain ahead of them.\n\nAll this being said, there’s a lot on the line in this one. Both Cleveland and Detroit feel like this is an opportunity to make a statement. Let’s see who does it.\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nIt’s not a coincidence that Cleveland has begun turning their season around just as three-point shots have started to fall.\n\nThe Cavs rank 22nd in three-point percentage this season. That’s never going to be good enough for a team like the Cavs to compete on a nightly basis. They aren’t built to consistently win games any other way.\n\nSince Dec. 22nd, however, Cleveland is 4th in three-point shooting. That’s more like it. A Cavs team that can bombard teams from downtown is the type of team that can win any given game.\n\nIn typical J.B. Bickerstaff fashion, Detroit has surprised the league by winning its games on the defensive end.\n\nThe Pistons are the 2nd-best defense in the NBA, behind only the reigning champion Oklahoma City Thunder. This team has grit-and-grinded its way to being a powerhouse in the Eastern Conference.\n\nRon Holland and Ausar Thompson are a dynamic defensive duo on the wing that can make this game difficult for Cleveland’s guards. Keep an eye on how Darius Garland and Donovan Mitchell fare in this one, because they may have to find solutions to Detroit’s defense at some point in the playoffs.",

    "description": "Kyren Williams and Blake Corum are dealing with injuries heading into Week 18. We break down what it means for fantasy football decisions.",
    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Rams are facing the Arizona Cardinals in Week 18 to close out the regular season, and they face some notable roster decisions. The running back is among them with Kyren Williams and Blake Corum both listed as questionable for Sunday’s game.\n\nThe Rams are locked into a wild card and will be either the No. 5 or No. 6 seed. The 49ers loss to the Seahawks on Saturday night means that the Rams will be the No. 5 seed if they beat the Cardinals and the No. 6 seed if they lose to the Cardinals. Rams head coach Sean McVay said on Friday that he would play his starters, but the injury report suggests otherwise. The team has ruled out starting cornerback Josh Wallace and starting right guard Kevin Dotson, and numerous starters are listed as questionable.\n\nKyren Williams and Blake Corum both entered the week dealing with ankle injuries. Williams was limited in all three practice sessions this week and has a questionable designation heading into game day. Blake Corum sat out practice on Wednesday and Thursday, but then got in a limited session on Friday before getting his own questionable designation.\n\nCorum seems on the wrong side of questionable and is likely to sit the regular season finale. Williams seems more likely to be able to go. If Williams plays the full game, he is a strong fantasy option — especially with Corum potentially sidelined. The question though is whether or not Williams plays the full game.\n\nRonnie Rivers and Jarquez Hunter are the two reserve options. Either could be an interesting dart throw in DFS or if you’re desperate in a fantasy football championship. The problem is that even if we know Williams will not play or only play limited snaps, it’s unclear which of Rivers or Hunter benefits. I would probably shy away from Williams given the uncertainty for the Rams.",

    "fullText": "We have elevated DT Ricky Barber and WR River Cracraft from the practice squad pic.twitter.com/LnFS6NHTYI\n\n— Washington Commanders (@Commanders) January 3, 2026\n\nKingsbury will be a hot name this offseason despite having a down year for the Commanders, but will he actually leave? He’s already been linked to the Tennessee Titans and Las Vegas Raiders job as a fit, but what about going to a division rival? ESPN’s Jordan Raanan said the Giants will cast a wide net in their head coaching search, but Kingsbury might be on the outside looking in.\n\n“Commanders’ offensive coordinator Kingsbury, who also has experience as an NFL head coach with the Cardinals, is considered a bright offensive mind. The question is if he’s the right fit for the New York market.” – Jordan Raanan, ESPN\n\nThe Giants interview list includes Mike McCarthy, Chris Shula, Antonio Pierce and more as they cast a wide net. https://t.co/o2weOafxQt\n\n— Jordan Raanan (@JordanRaanan) January 2, 2026\n\nIt would be a surprise if Kingsbury doesn’t even get an interview with the Giants, given his track record with young quarterbacks, and what he could do with Jaxson Dart. It sounds like they could be interested in Kingsbury, but he’s likely more of a tier two or tier three candidate for the Giants.\n\nThe former TCU standout is getting a look down the stretch with Tunsil out. Coleman looks more accomplished and urgent in everything he does. He is not the finished article by any stretch of the imagination, but his upturn in consistency indicates that all hope is not lost just yet.\n\nThis hasn’t gone unnoticed by Quinn. The coach thinks Coleman has learned a great deal in his second campaign. The athletic upside has always been there, but the lineman has developed a new sense of resilience that is standing him in exceptional stead.\n\n“I think…he has learned a lot here in year two. This is a resilient guy that can do a lot of things based on his athleticism, him learning and going through the hard moments.”Dan Quinn via Commanders.com\n\nColeman will start at left tackle again in Week 18 against the Philadelphia Eagles if he gets the all-clear to participate. He’s listed as questionable with a knee problem, but he practiced in full on Friday. That’s a positive sign, which gives him a fighting chance of finishing his campaign on a high note.\n\nThe Commanders elevated Cracraft from the practice squad to the active roster Saturday ahead of Sunday’s game against the Eagles. Cracraft has been elevated for consecutive weeks, finishing Christmas Day’s loss against the Cowboys with just one snap on the special-teams unit. With Terry McLaurin, Deebo Samuel, Treylon Burks and Chris Moore all healthy and active, Cracraft is likely in line to see the same minimal special-teams snap share in Sunday’s game.\n\n1) What were your big takeaways from the Week 16 matchup between the Commanders and Eagles?\n\nI do think it’s silly how the Commanders took such offense to the Eagles going for two late in the game. Why wait until then to show that kind of fight? Also, laughable to hear Dan Quinn talk tough about how Washington was going to see the Eagles again in two weeks. When it seemed like the Eagles will be resting their starters, which we now know is exactly the case. For Quinn to be afraid of going for it on fourth down (punted on 4th-and-4 from the minus 40-yard line down 11 with 9 minutes to go … and punted on 4th-and-6 from the minus 44-yard line down 11 with just 6:44 to go) and then act all tough in the postgame presser? That’s unserious behavior to me.\n\n2) How far do you think the Eagles will get in the post-season and what do you think will be their biggest secret to success or stumbling block?\n\nI think the Eagles can win the Super Bowl. Vic Fangio’s defense is awesome. Jalen Hurts has played well in the biggest games of his career. There is no juggernaut the Eagles simply can’t beat.\n\nDo you expect the Commanders will try especially hard this week or are they going to pack it in and rest key players with an eye to the 2026 season? How do fans want the team to approach this game?\n\nI don’t know that the Commanders will try especially hard to win, but they will certainly try as hard to win as they did in the last matchup (where the playoffs were already out of reach). Reports are that Dan Quinn still has the locker room, the players are still bought in, and the coaches and players still want to win games. So I’m sure they’ll try their hardest to win, just like last time, but the deck will be stacked against them due to all their injuries.\n\nThe decision to rest or play starters is not just about protecting players or gaining draft position, it’s also about putting together some good tape so the front office can actually evaluate the talent on the team. So many players have been injured or are returning from injury, so many players have been moved to different positions or roles (particularly on defense) due to injuries and due to Dan Quinn taking over the defense a few weeks ago, that it’s probably more important for the front office to get additional tape on these players playing their best in order to evaluate them than it is to get a slightly higher draft spot. What good does a better draft pick do if you can’t even evaluate your biggest team needs effectively? For this reason, as well as for pride and division rivalry, I think most fans will be rooting for the starters to play and the team to play well. In my opinion, the only reason to tank is if you need a top 2 pick for a QB, quality players at other positions can be found later in the draft.\n\nTampa Bay’s 16-14 win over the Panthers keeps it alive, but now the Bucs need the Saints to beat the Falcons to make the postseason.\n\nthe showdown game for first place in the NFC South did not yield a division winner, at least not yet.\n\nSo it went on the opening day of the final weekend of the NFL’s regular season. The Seahawks beat the San Francisco 49ers in Santa Clara, California, to secure the NFC West title and the conference’s No. 1 playoff seed. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers defeated the Carolina Panthers but will have to wait until Sunday to see whether that will be enough for them to win the NFC South.\n\nThe playoff field is taking shape and will be fully formed when Sunday’s play is done.\n\nThe Buccaneers helped their postseason cause. But they didn’t punch their playoff ticket, at least not yet.\n\nThe opening game of the final weekend of the NFL’s regular season did not determine as much as it could have. The Buccaneers beat the Panthers, 16-14, in the rain Saturday at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa. But they will have to wait until Sunday to find out whether they will secure their fifth straight NFC South title and the NFC’s No. 4 playoff seed.\n\nThey need the Atlanta Falcons to lose Sunday to the New Orleans Saints. If the Falcons beat the Saints, that would create a three-way tie for the division lead with matching 8-9 records. The Panthers would win the division in that case, based on tiebreakers.\n\n“We did everything we could today,” Buccaneers quarterback Baker Mayfield told ESPN afterward. “Sit back and see what happens tomorrow.”\n\nThe final show@BankofAmerica | #RaiseHail pic.twitter.com/UoGpgmFVLs\n\n— Washington Commanders (@Commanders) January 4, 2026\n\nCommanders edge rusher Von Miller needs one sack Sunday vs. the Eagles to finish the season with nine sacks and collect another $500,000 in incentives. pic.twitter.com/eDSPxZ9Lls\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) January 4, 2026\n\nCommanders WR Deebo Samuel has $650,000 on the line Sunday vs. the Eagles.

    "description": "Javonte Williams and Malik Davis are both out for the Cowboys’ Week 18 finale due to injuries. We break down what it means for Jaydon Blue fantasy football decisions.",
    "fullText": "The Dallas Cowboys have been playing out the string on a lost 2025-26 season, and they wrap things up on Sunday when they travel to face the New York Giants in Week 18. The Cowboys have nothing to play for other than pride, and they’ll be missing some key players in this game. Most notably on offense, they will be without running backs Javonte Williams and Malik Davis. That opens the door for Jaydon Blue to make his first start since the Cowboys drafted him in the fifth round of the 2025 NFL Draft.\n\nWilliams seemed fine heading into this week, but then was added to the Thursday practice participation report. He sat out Thursday with shoulder and neck issues. He was a DNP again on Friday before being ruled out on the final injury report. Davis showed up on the injury report on Wednesday with calf and eye issues. He was a DNP all three weeks before being ruled out. The Cowboys placed both players on injured reserve to officially end their seasons.\n\nIt is a good bet that Blue gets the bulk of Sunday’s workload. The team activated running back Phil Mafah, but look for him to serve as no more than a depth option.\n\nBlue has 22 carries for 65 yards and a five-yard reception this season. His biggest opportunity came in Week 7 and Week 8 when he had 15 of those carries for 58 yards. He had a fumble in Week 8, and that likely didn’t help him make his case for more work. Since then, he hasn’t touched the ball or even had an offensive snap. This week, he very well could match his season totals. He’s got talent, but at the very least he is an interesting volume play for Week 18 fantasy championships and DFS.",

That’s what a world class goalkeeper can do for you.\n\nEspanyol are one of the best teams in Spain at the moment, and you could see why on Saturday. They are organized and tough to break down, and have an incredible confidence about them under Manolo González.\n\nOver the summer, Barcelona poached their goalkeeper, and the cross town rivals somehow have only gotten better.\n\nThe fans at Cornellà were rabid, as they always are when the Blaugrana visit. The question on the night was how Joan García would deal with the pressure of coming back to his old stomping ground with the mission of keeping his team’s cushion at the top of the table in Spain.\n\nIt wasn’t an easy match, and perhaps Espanyol deserved something from it. Joan García, in the end, was the difference maker, and gave his team multiple chances to stay alive, while ultimately finding the breakthrough to win the game.\n\nSeeing him make those incredible saves is worth the price of admission. Did you ever think, being a Barcelona fan, that the goalkeeper of all people would be the one making the most exciting plays on the field?\n\nThere is no panic in that man. He stays calm, even when faced with the most unlikely of circumstances, squares up the attacking player in front of him, and somehow finds a way, time and time again, to come out on top.\n\nOne versus one with the keeper to beat? No so fast.\n\nA point blank header? Easy work.\n\nOne of your own defenders getting in the way? Sayonara Gerard Martín.\n\nThat is exactly how you want to start the new year if you’re Barcelona. We’re at the point in the season where the stakes are high, but the team can rest easier knowing they have one of the best shot stoppers in the world.\n\nWith that fact anchoring you, it comes down to the goal scorers doing their job.\n\nHansi Flick did well to make the changes he made in the second half. Dani Olmo and Fermín López were the men for the job on the night, and made it count when finally, in the dying moments of the game, their number was called.\n\nThese are the types of games that, when you look back on it, win you trophies.\n\nI have my concerns about Barcelona this season. They are an imperfect team, and when it comes down to it, especially in cup competitions, I worry they could be their own worst enemies.\n\nSeeing Joan García perform at this level, however, makes me believe that they could very well make it through even on the toughest of nights.\n\nIf we feel this way about him as fans, imagine what it does for the confidence of the players.\n\nInstead of waiting for the other shoe to drop when they aren’t playing well, they know they can keep battling until the breakthrough moment appears.\n\nJoan García has arrived, and that should give Barcelona hope heading into the new year that good things are around the corner.",

    "fullText": "It’s the final game day of the 2025 NFL season for our Minnesota Vikings, as they’ll be hosting the Green Bay Packers this afternoon in the regular season finale. We want everyone to be able to follow along with all of the action from U.S. Bank Stadium by whichever means they’d like, so we’re going to put all of that info here in one place for you.\n\nBecause this is a low-stakes contest in the grand scheme of things this week in the NFL, we get to kick things off at the best possible time for NFL action to get underway, that being noon Central time on Sunday. This game will be covered by the CBS family of networks, including WCCO-4 in the Twin Cities, with Spero Dedes and Adam Archuleta on the call. If you’re wondering whether or not you’re in the local broadcast area for this one, here’s this week’s map from the folks at 506 Sports, with the Packers/Vikings game represented by the blue area.\n\nIf you’re not in the local broadcast area, you’ll have to rely on YouTube TV NFL Sunday Ticket.\n\nFor our men and women in uniform serving overseas, the American Forces Network will. . .surprisingly enough. . .be bring you this one LIVE on AFN Sports. Kickoff is slated for 1800Z, which works out to 1900L for viewers in Central Europe, 2100L for everyone in Iraq and Kuwait, and 0300L on Monday morning for fans in Japan and Korea.\n\nIf you’re going to be traveling or just prefer to listen to things through the magic of radio, we have updated our list of Vikings Radio Network affiliates for this season. Wherever you are in the upper Midwest, you should be covered.\n\nIf you have satellite radio, you can catch the Vikings feed on Channel 229. If you’re utilizing the SiriusXM app, you can listen on the Vikings’ permanent home there, which is Channel 820.\n\nAccording to the folks from Football Zebras, the officiating crew for this week’s game will be led by John Hussey. This will be the first time that the Vikings have seen his crew since last season. . .it was his crew that officiated the Vikings’ loss to the Los Angeles Rams in last year’s Wild Card round.\n\nYep, the weather isn’t going to affect this one, folks, since it’s going to be played indoors at U.S. Bank Stadium. If you’re going to be headed out to one last tailgate. . .well, according to our friends at WeatherNation, it’s going to be a bit unpleasant. Temperatures will get into the mid-20s by kickoff, but there’s going to be some freezing rain starting around 11 AM, changing to snow in the early afternoon, which should make for an absolutely delightful trip home for everyone in attendance at today’s game. Drive carefully, folks.\n\nThe line for this one has changed significantly since things opened up earlier in the week. The Vikings opened the week as a 5.5-point favorite, but as news has come in through the week, that number has ballooned to the point where the Vikings are now a whopping 10.5-point favorite over the Packers, according to FanDuel. The over/under on the game has not changed, as that number still rests at 36.5 points.\n\nI believe if you have NFL+ and you live in the local area, you can stream the game on one of your devices. Otherwise, NFL Sunday Ticket is your lone legal streaming option, as far as I can tell. I don’t care about illegal streaming options.\n\nThat should be everything you need to be able to follow along with all of the action of today’s 2025 regular season finale for our Minnesota Vikings, folks. As always, we will have our first Open Thread of the day dropping about half an hour before kickoff at 11:30 AM Central time, and we hope to see a lot of you there as we wrap up this 2025 season.",

    "title": "Cowboys news: Matt Eberflus decision awaits Dallas after final game",
    "description": "Your Sunday morning Cowboys news.",
    "fullText": "After a disappointing season defensively, the Cowboys could be making a move at defensive coordinator but nothing concrete as of yet.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys are reportedly expected to make some changes to their defensive coaching staff at the end of the 2025 season. According to NFL.com’s Ian Rapoport and Tom Pelissero, it is “likely” some new coaches will be brought in on the defensive side of the ball, but “no decision has been made” yet on defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus. Rapoport and Pelissero noted that meetings about the Cowboys’ future will begin Monday, which could be when and where the organization makes a call on Eberflus’ status.\n\nPrior to the start of the 2025 season, the Cowboys traded superstar pass-rusher Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers while in the midst of a contract stalemate. There were already concerns about Dallas’ defense after ranking 28th in total defense and 31st in scoring defense last season, and the issues were amplified without Parsons.\n\nThrough 17 weeks this season, the Cowboys have the No. 30 overall defense and No. 32 scoring defense, allowing 376.8 total yards and 29.8 points per game.\n\nThat is primarily why the Cowboys missed the playoffs with a 7-8-1 record despite ranking first in the NFL in total offense and fourth in scoring offense. Not surprisingly, the Cowboys lacked a consistent pass-rush this season following the departure of Parsons, as they are tied for 23rd in the NFL with 31 sacks and don’t have a single player with more than 5.5 sacks on the year.A strong argument can be made that Eberflus simply didn’t have the personnel needed to succeed this season, but since it is easier to make a coaching change than it is to completely overhaul a defensive unit, Eberflus could prove to be a one-and-done DC in Dallas.When the Cowboys hired Eberflus to coach under first-year head coach Brian Schottenheimer, Eberflus was coming off a three-year run as head coach of the Chicago Bears.\n\nThe Cowboys have placed their top two veteran running backs on injured reserve, leaving the door opening for Phil Mafah and Jaydon Blue to see significant playing time.\n\nFRISCO, Texas — The end of the 2025 season has arrived for the Dallas Cowboys, and earlier than they’d like, but they’ll at least try to avoid a second consecutive losing season when they travel to take on the New York.\n\nGiants in Week 18. Achieving that mission just got a bit tougher, though. Though they are expected to start four-time Pro Bowl quarterback Dak Prescott at MetLife Stadium, the same can’t be said for some other key players — sidelined due to injury. On Friday, the Cowboys ruled out Javonte Williams, Malik Davis, T.J. Bass, DeMarvion Overshown and rookie cornerback Shavon Revel.\n\nOne day later, they made a list of transactions that included moving several players to season-ending injured reserve, mostly academic, at this point, to clear the way for the activation of others from IR who have yet to touch the field this season. The decision to waive Trevon Diggs left one open seat on the 53-man roster but, given the laundry list of moves made on Saturday, that wasn’t enough. Three players were moved to IR and two activated, the additional seat being awarded to an undrafted, hard-hitting rookie and there was also an elevation to help with depth and special teams coverage.\n\nThe understandable decision to shut down both Williams and Davis not only opens the door for Mafah to try and build on his impressive preseason film, but also for fellow rookie running back Jaydon Blue to get another chance to show the Cowboys he is as advertised. Blue hasn’t been active in a game since late October, relegated to the inactives until head coach Brian Schottenheimer was satisfied with what he sees in practice, consistency-wise.\n\nOne of the top edge rushers in the draft says he would love to play for the Cowboys.\n\nOne of college football’s best is shining on the biggest stage. Miami’s Rueben Bain Jr. has recorded four sacks and 5.5 tackles for loss in the College Football Playoffs, and he’s making his pitch to Jerry Jones ahead of the 2026 NFL Draft. The Cowboys obviously need help putting pressure on opposing quarterbacks, and they can easily get that with Bain Jr., one of the most highly rated prospects in the upcoming draft. Cowboys fans will love what Bain Jr. had to say to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram following Miami’s win against Ohio State. The star edge rusher says he would love to play for the Cowboys if given the opportunity.\n\n“It’d be amazing. Any opportunity I can get, no matter where I’m playing, it’d be a blessing. I’ve already made myself familiar with the [stadium] grounds. It’d be an amazing opportunity.”\n\nMiami star edge rusher Rueben Bain Jr. says he would love to play for the Cowboys\n\nThe only thing that could stop Jones from drafting Bain Jr. would be if another team were to beat them to the punch. The Cowboys have also been linked to Texas Tech edge rusher David Bailey. Drafting him would be a win to fix their atrocious pass rush. The losses to the Lions and Vikings served as harsh reminders that if Dallas were to draft two pass rushers in the first round, it wouldn’t be too extreme at all.\n\nThe defense was barely able to touch Jared Goff and J.J. McCarthy, allowing both quarterbacks to look like prime Tom Brady. The departure of Trevon Diggs will have a lot of mock drafts predicting the Cowboys to take a cornerback with one of their two first-round picks. But a pass rusher should be the priority with their first pick, and Bain fits that bill. Bain Jr. is a big body at 6-foot-3, 275 pounds, and he possesses the power and speed off the edge that Dallas badly needs. He and Donovan Ezeiruaku could end up becoming a real problem for the NFL.\n\nBreaking down the Cowboys defensive plans versus the Giants.\n\nIn this episode of Between the Lines, we flip the attention to the defensive line, where chaos meets strategy. This is where the Cowboys’ games are won and lost so let’s dive in.\n\n(2025 Stats: 643 Total snaps, 40 Total Tackles, 6 TFL, 51 Pressures, 3 Sack)\n\n(2025 Stats: 392 Total snaps, 26 Total Tackles, 3 TFL, 12 Pressures, 0 Sacks, 1 PD)\n\n(2025 Stats: 697 Total snaps, 35 Total Tackles, 6 TFL, 44 Pressures, 3 Sacks)\n\n(2025 Stats: 89 Total snaps, 3 Total Tackle, 0 TFL, 1 Pressure, 0 Sacks)\n\n(2025 Stats [including Jets]: 596 Total snaps, 48 Total Tackles, 11 TFL, 51 Pressures, 2.5 Sacks, 3 FF, 1 INT)\n\nThe heart of this matchup is easy, Dallas needs the big guys in the middle to squeeze the pocket and clog running lanes, while the Giants will try to keep the ball on schedule and get it out fast. The Cowboys have been strong up front this year. As a defense, Dallas ranks eighth in pass-rush win rate (40%) and fourth in run-stop win rate (32%). Inside, Osa Odighizuwa and Kenny Clark both show up on the win rate individual leaderboards, with Odighizuwa ranking eighth in pass rush and run stop win rate among defensive tackles, with Clark not far behind him. But it’s Quinnen Williams who’s the sledgehammer here, and the Giants’ patched-up interior is exactly the kind of assignment that Williams can utilize his impact to create drive-ending plays. On the win-rate board, Williams is king in Dallas, ranking second among defensive tackles in Run Stop Win Rate at 46% with a 15% Pass Rush Win rate that ranks third, that’s top-shelf interior defense while consistently drawing extra help which helps the rest of the line. This is the core of Dallas’ plan to force long down-and-distance situations.\n\nThe Giants’ offensive line has been beat up. Left tackle Andrew Thomas and center John Michael Schmitz both hit injured reserve, so New York has turned to rookie Marcus Mbow at left tackle and veteran Austin Schlottmann at center. Before the injury, Thomas was a top-10 tackle in pass-block win rate, which shows the drop-off Dallas might be able to attack now that he’s sidelined. Communication inside between the guards and center becomes important, especially against stunts and late movement.\n\nEven with the injuries, New York’s blocking profile isn’t a pushover. As a team, the Giants sit 11th in pass-block win rate, but 18th in run-block win rate. That suggests the ball is coming out on time and that they lean on a quick passing game to help the line. Dallas has to answer by winning early in the snap so the quick game doesn’t have time.\n\nThe quarterback picture is simple. Rookie Jaxson Dart is running the huddle. His year-one line reads 2,042 passing yards, 13 touchdowns, five picks, and he’s added useful yards with his legs in spots including adding nine rushing touchdowns. The Giants’ run game is the other pillar. They rank sixth in rushing yards per game, with Tyrone Tracy Jr. at 637 yards and Devin Singletary adding 366 yards, both having to take the wheel with Cam Skattebo out for the year. That blend is exactly how New York tries to protect a banged-up front. Dallas’ interior has to knock them off schedule on first down so second-and-long turns into a difficult and obvious passing play.",

    "title": "Audi Crooks may have her flaws, but she still looks more than championship-ready for No. 10 Iowa State",
    "description": "Audi Crooks seems to have finally overcome inconsistency, and that means Iowa State could win it all.",
    "fullText": "Iowa State junior center Audi Crooks, who was only ranked the 57th best prospect in her high school class of 2023 by espnW, is transcending expectations yet again.\n\nAs a freshman at Iowa State, she quickly invited the attention of diehard hoops fans through interior dominance. Unfortunately, a flatlined performance against Stanford in the NCAA Tournament made many write off Crooks as a gimmick player with no versatility—far from someone who could one day lead a team that contends for a national championship.\n\nWhile Crooks took another step forward last season, Iowa State took a step back. The Cyclones lost in the first round of the tournament to Michigan. Crooks scored 28 in the Round of 64 loss to Michigan, which was still not enough to stop people from diagnosing her with “regular-season player” syndrome. The question has never been whether Crooks is a good player. Instead, fans and analysts rightfully have wondered whether her play style can be sustained over a tournament run, and if it can translate to the WNBA.\n\nIowa State’s offense blossoms from the branches of Crooks’ scoring. Opponents must choose a path: Leave perimeter shooters open and send help to Crooks, or stay tight on the 3-point line and let Crooks isolate on inferior post defenders. Most teams elect for the former, which is one of the reasons that Iowa State ranks 13th in the country in 3-point percentage (38.2 percent). Kansas recently tried the latter, and gave up 41 points to Crooks in a loss.\n\nAUDI CROOKS TODAY 🔥🔥🔥\n\n• 41 POINTS \n• 4 REBOUNDS\n• 19/28 FG\n• 30 MINUTES PLAYEDpic.twitter.com/QABIwf0NZU\n\n— Women’s Hoops Network (@WomensHoops_USA) December 21, 2025\n\nThe Cyclones offense embodies a rock and a hard place. That’s a good thing!\n\nHowever, imagine being stuck between a rock and a hard place, but the rock is having a bad game. The rock is shooting 3-for-20. The rock looks more like a pebble this game. When you step over that pebble, it becomes a little harder (or, impossible) for the hard place to trap you. That’s been the modus operandi for Crooks and her production. When she has a great game, Iowa State is invincible. When she has a bad game, they’re powerless.\n\nIt can be reasoned that this is the case with all great players, but that isn’t entirely true.\n\nWhile Crooks is an elite scorer, her frame and lack of three-dimensionality come back to bite her when the offensive engine isn’t clicking. She’s slow-footed on defense and can’t guard switches, nor can she keep up with mobile forwards. She is at risk of being beaten down the floor in transition if she misses a post finish. She’s actually a below-average rebounder for her size and usage. She’s not a threat to stretch the floor. Pointing out Crooks’ coarse edges isn’t to say that she’s not a phenomenal player. Instead, it’s a recognition her limited ability to impact winning while having a bad game. If she isn’t scoring, her impact on the game is often negative.\n\nWithout a drastic change in Crooks’ method, overcoming the looming threat of an off night isn’t possible. Crooks thrives because of who she is and how she plays, but she also pays the price for it when her shot isn’t falling. The steep, anxious mountain that Crooks has to climb to advance far in the NCAA Tournament, and even win a national champion, is one of invincibility. She cannot have a bad game. She cannot be a non-factor.\n\nAs we’ve turned the calendar into conference play, somehow, Crooks is summiting.\n\nFirst player in the last 17 years to have five straight 30-point games on 60% shooting or better!! That’s our @AudiCrooks 🤩\n\n🌪️🏀🌪️ pic.twitter.com/FWUMP04vYD\n\n— Cyclone Basketball (@CycloneWBB) December 31, 2025\n\nIn her third collegiate season, Crooks is scoring the basketball to such an extent that maybe she could just carry the Cyclones to a championship. She isn’t just a niche pull in “ball-knower” conversations anymore. She’s encroaching on household-name status.\n\nCrooks leads the country in scoring at 29.4 points per game. Even more remarkable, she’s second in the country in field goal percentage at 72.5 percent. Never before has there been such an intersection of volume and efficiency. It wouldn’t be crazy at all to say that Crooks is having one of the greatest scoring seasons in women’s basketball history. The gap in efficiency rating between Crooks and the second-highest player, UConn’s Sarah Strong, is greater than the gap between Strong and the 10th most efficient player.\n\nIowa State is shooting 38 percent from 3 (13th in the country) and 60 percent on 2-pointers (first in the country). They’re the sixth highest-scoring offense in college basketball, and a 14-0 record has them at No. 10 in the most recent AP Poll.\n\nAudi Crooks in a 80-62 win @ Houston : 35 points on 17-21 shooting, 1-1 from the FT line & 13 rebounds in 34 minutes (5th straight game with 30+ points) pic.twitter.com/7sYfPaprKQ\n\n— Lee Harvey (@Sayian_Warrior) December 31, 2025\n\nMaybe the question shouldn’t be, “Can Iowa State overcome a bad Audi Crooks game?” Maybe the key to Iowa State’s success comes from Crooks’ “bad” being no longer being “bad.”. She’s not going to score 30 points every game (although sometimes it feels like it), but if a “bad” Audi Crooks game can look like 14 points, rather than four, the Cyclones can get somewhere.\n\nFor the first time in her career, Crooks’ dominance is at such a level that it feels sustainable. It feels consistent. Summiting her mountain, Crooks can now afford to fall from her peak on occasion. She just can’t find herself at base camp.",

State has allowed inferior opponents like Penn State, Oakland, and Cornell to hang around, and this sloppy play finally caught up to them Friday night on the road against a fiery Nebraska Cornhusker team, losing 58-56 to the tune of 19 turnovers.\n\nUSC, the 24th ranked team in the land, will head to East Lansing following a crushing loss on the road in ann arbor Friday night. Similarly to Michigan State, the Trojans committed 21 turnovers. However, unlike our Spartans, USC was not able to overcome these mistakes and lost in blowout fashion, 96-66. This brings the Trojans to a 1-2 record in Big Ten play thus far, having split their first pair conference games against Oregon and Washington.\n\nSo, what’s the scoop on Southern Cal? Their record and AP Top 25 ranking are a credit to the ability of Eric Musselman’s squad to win close games in their non-conference schedule. USC put together a non-con resume that includes a narrow victory over Grand Canyon, an overtime win against the (Troy) Trojans, and three impressive triumphs in Hawaii against the likes of Boise State, Seton Hall, and Arizona State to take home the Maui Invitational Title. The trip to Hawaii was a key inflection point for USC, as they returned to the mainland with not only the trophy, but with a huge new question to be answered- who will be able step up after a key injury to star combo guard Rodney Rice. The junior had been averaging upwards of 20 points and 6 assists per game, before suffering an injury to his right shoulder against Seton Hall. In his absence, several Trojans have stepped up to help shoulder the load and continue putting up impressive offensive numbers (apparently except against uofm). Let’s take a look at the main contributors for this USC squad, with likely starters in bold.\n\n#9: Ryan Cornish, Guard – 6’5 173 lbs\n\n#4: Chad Baker-Mazara, Forward – 6’7 172 lbs\n\n#5: Terrance Williams II, Forward- 6’7 235 lbs\n\n#6: Jacob Cofie, Forward – 6’10 231 lbs\n\n#2: Ezra Ausar, Forward – 6’9 253 lbs\n\n#7: Jordan Marsh, Guard – 5’11 146 lbs\n\n#8: Jerry Easter II, Guard – 6’5 193 lbs\n\n#45: Gabe Dynes, Center – 7’5 214 lbs\n\n#13: Kam Woods, Guard – 6’2 185 lbs\n\nEven in the face of injuries to Rice and Senior Guard Armorion Dickerson, the Trojan rotation is a deep one, especially in their frontcourt. USC can utilize the towering Center Gabe Dynes in big lineups, or play more of a small ball style with Ezra Ausar sliding into the five spot.\n\nIn terms of the backcourt, USC recently turned heads with a fascinating move that, to take a wild guess, Tom Izzo is not a fan of. Perhaps some Spartan fans recall watching Kam Woods play for the Robert Morris Colonials a season ago in the Cleveland regional of the 2025 NCAA Tournament. Well, this season, Woods entered the transfer portal but had yet to find a new home. That is, until December 18th, when he made headlines as an in-season transfer portal signing with immediate eligibility. Woods has given Eric Musselman and co some much needed depth at the guard position, and has already logged 22 and 16 minutes in games against UC Santa Cruz and michigan, respectively.\n\nSince the injury to Rice, Senior Chad Baker-Mazara has stepped up as the focal point of USC’s offense, and his numbers speak for themselves. Baker-Mazara is averaging an impressive 20.4 points and 5.1 rebounds, especially eye-opening when considering Rice had also been averaging north of 20 points a night. Additionally, USC has a solid big in Ezra Ausar, who is good for 17.1 PPG, playing both the 4 and 5 spots. Long story short? The Trojans have the ability to score at a very high rate, and had not scored under 70 points until their loss to michigan.\n\nFriday Night: Outliers or Areas of Concern?\n\nBoth programs are in a surprisingly similar place. Needless to say, coaches Tom Izzo and Eric Musselman were certainly disappointed with both of their team’s performances this past Friday. A combined 40(!) turnovers between the Spartans and Trojans in their respective matchups made a road victory in either game nearly impossible. Similar to how USC has missed the presence of a second superstar guard in Rodney Rice, Michigan State certainly felt the absence and ball-handling ability of combo guard Divine Ugochukwu against Nebraska. The good news for Spartan fans- there is hope that Divine will be able to return Monday night, as he was suffering from illness, rather than injury, in Lincoln that made him unable to suit up.\n\nFriday night brought with it uncharacteristic losses for both teams. Michigan State, a team that this year has been 10-deep, with key contributors coming off the bench, earned only three points from non-starters against Nebraska. On the other hand, the high powered USC offense was stymied against michigan. The Trojans began the game with three straight turnovers, and dug themselves an 11-0 hole, unable to score until the 13:19 minute mark of the first half.\n\nTaking a closer look, both of Friday night’s top-25 matchups involving these two squads represented a diversion from each of these teams’ own identities and styles of play. Southern Cal assisted on only 4 of their 20 made field goals against michigan, compared to their season average prior to Friday, which was 17.1 per game. The ball was sticking for the Trojans in ann arbor, with far too many unsuccessful attempts at isolation basketball against a stifling wolverine defense. Chad Baker-Mazara also picked up four first half fouls, heavily impacting his second half defense, and coming as a result of Coach Musselman desperately needing offensive production late in the 1H.\n\nFor the green and white, it was beyond just statistics. For the most part against Nebraska, MSU did not play like a team whose mantra is defend, rebound, and run. While State did out-rebound the Cornhuskers and prove successful in holding their opponent to only 58 points, the transition game was missed dearly as Michigan State continues to suffer from a stagnant half court offense. Tom Izzo’s team scored only 6 fast break points, and for most of the game played at a pace as dictated by Nebraska. This spelled disaster to the tune of a loss and only 56 points scored in Lincoln.\n\nThe road does not get any easier for a Michigan State team desperate to get back to the basketball it was playing prior to the Duke game. Nor does it for a USC team hungry to atone for Friday’s embarrassing loss before leaving the state of Michigan. Monday’s matchup will feature two teams coming off poor performances who should have no problem getting up for this one. While still incredibly early into conference play, this game has the feel of a must-win matchup for either of these teams, both needing a win to stay on track in the race for a Big Ten title.\n\nWhich team will look most improved from their last time out? Which team can limit turnovers? These questions and more will be answered at 8:30 Monday night in front of what will hopefully be a raucous alumni Izzone crowd.",

    "description": "The breakout season for the Cowboys' running back has led to some late-year injury concerns. Is he suiting up for the finale?",
    "fullText": "The Dallas Cowboys proved themselves right in 2025. For the last several years, they've reworked their philosophy about the run game, choosing to be penny wise in forming their backfield. After moving on from Ezekiel Elliott, they franchise-tagged Tony Pollard before letting him walk and replacing him with Rico Dowdle. Dowdle was then replaced this season by Javonte Williams, who was placed in a brand new offensive attack orchestrated by new head coach Brian Schottenheimer and new OC Klayton Adams.\n\nWilliams responded with the best RB season in Dallas since 2019, with over 1,200 yards on the ground, another 100-plus receiving and 13 total touchdowns. He has been able to last injury-free through much of the season, but alas he hasn't made it to the actual finish line.\n\nWilliams was knocked out of the Cowboys' Week 15 game with a shoulder/neck injury during the first half. He was replaced by Malik Davis for a while, but he was able to return to the game. He played in Week 16 and Week 17, but left the last contest midway through, again ceding his role to Davis. Now he's on the final injury report for 2025 with those same shoulder and neck ailments.\n\nIn fact, he's not just on the injury report, Williams has been ruled out of the contest, ending his season with the Cowboys. He is set to be a free agent in 2026.\n\nWilliams has toted the rock 252 times for 1,201 yards and 11 rushing touchdowns. he's also caught 35 of 51 passes for 137 yards and another two scores, giving him 13 on the season.\n\nMatchup: Dallas Cowboys vs New York Giants\n\nWeek 1 at Eagles: 15 CAR, 54 YDS, 2 TD, 2 REC, 0 TD\n\nWeek 2 vs. Giants: 18 CAR, 97 YDS, 1 TD, 6 REC, 0 TD\n\nWeek 3 vs Bears: 10 CAR, 76 YDS, 0 TD, 5 REC, 0 TD\n\nWeek 4 vs Packers: 20 CAR, 85 YDS, 1 TD, 3 REC, 0 TD\n\nWeek 5 vs Jets: 16 CAR, 135 YDS, 1 TD, 1 REC, 1 TD\n\nWeek 6 vs Panthers: 13 CAR, 29 YDS, 0 TD, 5 REC, 0 TD\n\nWeek 7 vs Commanders: 19 CAR, 116 YDS, 1 TD, 1 REC, 0 TD\n\nWeek 8 vs Broncos: 13 CAR, 41 YDS, 2 TD, 1 REC, 0 TD\n\nWeek 9 vs Cardinals: 15 CAR, 83 YDS, 0 TD, 1 REC, 0 TD\n\nWeek 11 vs Raiders: 22 CAR, 93 YDS, 0 TD, 1 REC, 0 TD\n\nWeek 12 vs Eagles: 20 CAR, 87 YDS, 0 TD, 2 REC, 0 TD\n\nWeek 13 vs Chiefs: 17 CAR, 59 YDS, 0 TD, 3 REC, 1 TD\n\nWeek 14 vs Lions: 17 CAR, 67 YDS, 1 TD, 2 REC, 0 TD\n\nWeek 15 vs Vikings: 15 CAR, 91 YDS, 1 TD, 0 REC, 0 TD\n\nWeek 16 vs Chargers: 9 CAR, 34 YDS, 0 TD, 2 REC, 0 TD\n\nWeek 17 vs Commanders: 13 CAR, 54 YDS, 1 TD, 0 REC, 0 TD\n\nFollow Cowboys Wire on Facebook to join in on the conversation with fellow fans!\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cowboys Wire: Is Javonte Williams playing today?

    "description": "There's been a prime time NFL game Sunday night every week since early September. But is there a \"Sunday Night Football\" game tonight?",
    "fullText": "\"Sunday Night Football\" brought us one of the games of the year in Week 17.\n\nThe host San Francisco 49ers and Chicago Bears traded blows throughout all four quarters in a dazzling offensive display. It's the third week in a row in which the final game of the Sunday slate was a one-score affair; the 49ers' 42-38 win is the latest following the Patriots' 28-24 win in Week 16 over the Ravens and the Vikings' 34-26 win over the Cowboys.\n\nTeams have put on a show all season in prime time for a national audience. All 32 teams will be in action this weekend, the final week of the regular season; every contest is a division matchup.\n\nWill that slate include one more prime time matchup to cap off Sunday's action? Here's what to know.\n\nYes, there is a \"Sunday Night Football\" game in Week 18. It's a high-stakes divisional matchup to boot: the Baltimore Ravens and Pittsburgh Steelers face off to decide who wins the AFC North.\n\nPittsburgh could've made things tougher for the Ravens by winning in Week 17 over last-placed Cleveland. Instead, the Steelers' offense stumbled, and the Browns won 13-6. That result and the Ravens' win over the Packers a day earlier set up a winner-takes-all Week 18 matchup.\n\nWhichever team wins on \"Sunday Night Football\" will win the AFC North title and earn the No. 4 seed in the AFC playoffs.\n\nHere's a look back at the full slate of Sunday night games this year.

    "description": "Will the Falcons keep head coach Raheem Morris and GM Terry Fontenot? NFL insiders weigh in",
    "fullText": "The Atlanta Falcons were supposed to turn the corner with head coach Raheem Morris at the helm, but it's been nearly two full seasons and they have yet to take that next step. Morris is 15-18 overall entering Sunday's season finale against the New Orleans Saints.\n\nAfter winning three straight games, though, Morris' seat seems to have cooled down considerably. While the team has already been eliminated from playoff contention, the Falcons' recent winning streak has shaken up the NFC South division race.\n\nIf Atlanta wins on Sunday, the Carolina Panthers will NFC South champs. If the Falcons lose, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers will clinch their fifth straight division title. But will a late-season winning streak be enough for Morris to save his job?\n\nAs we approach another Black Monday, NFL insiders have been gathering intel on each coaching situation. Let's see what those around the league are hearing about Morris and general manager Terry Fontenot.\n\nAccording to Dianna Russini of The Athletic, Falcons owner Arthur Blank is expected to bring in a consulting firm to evaluate everything. Russini even suggested that the team may keep Morris and move on from Fontenot in the offseason.\n\nThat work is expected to be weighed alongside the organization’s internal evaluations: two seasons (and a 15-18 record) under coach Raheem Morris, five seasons under Fontenot, how this year has unfolded, the perceived state of the roster and the franchise’s overall team-building approach. Many around the league expect the Falcons to move on from Fontenot and stick with Morris as coach. One potential added voice to the mix? Former quarterback Matt Ryan, who is in talks to return to the organization in a front-office role. -- Dianna Russini, The Athletic\n\nESPN's Jeremy Fowler also put out a feature discussing NFL coaches on the hot seat. Fowler said the Falcons haven't given up on Morris, but Arthur Blank clearly wanted to see more from the team over the last two years.\n\nThe Falcons have not quit on Morris, who has railed off three consecutive wins to make his case for a third year in Atlanta. But that doesn't ensure his return. Morris would most likely need to make staff changes if he does stay. Special teams has been a bugaboo, and quarterback Michael Penix Jr.'s development hasn't proceeded as hoped. -- Jeremy Fowler, ESPN\n\nOver at NFL.com, Ian Rapoport and Tom Pelissero released a new hot-seat breakdown. The Falcons have been a disappointment, but it sounds like Morris may have bought himself some goodwill with that upset win over the Rams.\n\nAnd for as disappointing as the Falcons were even a month ago, they’ve found a spark down the stretch, playing hard for head coach Raheem Morris and winning three games in a row with formerly demoted veteran Kirk Cousins at quarterback. The reason owners wait to see the entire product is to learn how a team responds to adversity. And with all eyes on them, Atlanta beat the Los Angeles Rams on national TV on Monday night. It gives Blank a lot to think about as he weighs the futures of Morris, who has three years left on his contract, and GM Terry Fontenot, who has one. -- Ian Rapoport & Tom Pelissero, NFL.com\n\nThe Falcons will close out the season against the Saints at 1 p.m. on Sunday afternoon. Once the team makes a decision on Morris and Fontenot, it will be on to free agency for Atlanta. Some key players, including tight end Kyle Pitts and linebacker Kaden Elliss, will be free agents.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Falcons Wire: Atlanta Falcons: NFL insiders on Raheem Morris' job status",

    "fullText": "Your team urgently needs reinforcements for the second half of the season, but the budget is too tight for a big deal? Fortunately, there are real transfer bargains in 2026.\n\nWith these professionals, your club could currently make a real steal.\n\nMarc-André ter Stegen is currently available for a price like never before. The world-class goalkeeper is now only the third choice at Barcelona but urgently needs playing time to be Germany's goalkeeper at the 2026 World Cup.\n\nAccording to the Spanish 'Mundo Deportivo', Barça is also willing to let the goalkeeper go on loan until the summer. Even better: In the hope that the keeper will then present himself for an expensive summer sale, Barcelona would probably continue to pay the majority of his salary during a loan. Can it get any better?\n\nIf your club needs an offensive player – maybe so. Memphis Depay is currently no longer on the big football stage. The Dutchman joined Corinthians São Paulo in September 2024.\n\nThe forward still has a contract with the Brazilians until the end of 2026. With a current market value of just eight million euros , this already smells like a bargain.\n\nDanilho Doekhi could also be a steal. The central defender is having a strong season in the jersey of Union Berlin, keeping the defense tight at the back and creating goal threats up front. In 15 season games, Doekhi has already scored four times for the Köpenickers. Unfortunately for Union.\n\n📸 Pau Barrena - 2025 Getty Images\n\nThe 27-year-old could leave for free in the summer of 2026. If FCU wants to make money with Doekhi, he would essentially need to be sold now. A good negotiating position for other clubs.\n\nWhat's happening with Jonas Wind? Unfortunately, not much at the moment. After two strong seasons in the VfL Wolfsburg jersey, the Dane is currently looking back on a poor first half of the season. In eight season games, the striker hasn't scored a single goal, and since the end of November, he has also been struggling with a thigh injury.\n\nThe Wolves are likely very interested in a departure, as Wind's contract also expires in the summer of 2026.\n\nJust like Timo Werner's. The striker, who once scored 28 Bundesliga goals for Leipzig in the 2019/20 season, is currently at the absolute low point of his career.\n\nAfter three short appearances in the current season, the Saxons are eager to get rid of him. Werner's market value is currently around three million euros. A small reminder: We're still talking about a 57-time national player who is only 29 years old.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "fullText": "The Pittsburgh Steelers may have gotten a good look at their next potential starting quarterback in the Green Bay Packers' Week 17 matchup against the Baltimore Ravens, where one quarterback broke out for a monster game, leaving fans stunned.\n\nAccording to ESPN’s Dan Orlovsky, Packers QB Malik Willis would be the perfect quarterback for the Steelers’ 2026 roster after his electric performance against Baltimore.\n\n“If Mike Tomlin wins and let’s say they keep him as their head coach, and I would, the number one move I would make would be Malik Willis,” Orlovsky said via ESPN’s First Take. “I would go sign Malik Willis from Green Bay in free agency this year. I think he’s proven to be a starting quarterback. I think that starts your next journey in Pittsburgh.”\n\nSelected by the Tennessee Titans with the 86th overall pick in the third round of the 2022 NFL Draft, Willis found success after he was traded to the Green Bay Packers in 2024.\n\nGetting the starting nod over an injured Jordan Love, Willis completed 85.7% of his passes for 288 yards and one touchdown for an impressive 134.6 passer rating in Week 17. He also recorded nine rushing attempts for 60 yards and two more touchdowns.\n\nA dual-threat quarterback with a cannon of an arm, Willis could join the Steelers on a cheaper deal than most starting-caliber quarterbacks, giving Pittsburgh enough wiggle room to keep the rest of the roster competitive for potentially years to come.\n\nFor up-to-date Steelers coverage, \n\nThis article originally appeared on Steelers Wire: Steelers linked to Packers QB Malik Willis in 2026 free agency",

    "fullText": "Arsenal had a few injury concerns ahead of this weekend’s match against Bournemouth, with Max Dowman, Riccardo Calafiori, and Cristhian Mosquera all ruled out of action, and doubts around the fitness of Declan Rice.\n\nRice managed to overcome his knee swelling to make the squad and score a brace, but there was an unexpected absence in the form of Kai Havertz.\n\nHavertz had returned to the Arsenal squad for the previous game against Aston Villa, recovering from a knee injury to be involved. So there were initial fears that perhaps his absence on Saturday could indicate a setback, especially as the forward hadn’t been spotted in training the previous day.\n\nFortunately, Sam Blitz of Sky Sports reported ahead of the game that there’s no setback to Havertz, and his absence is just load management.\n\nHavertz obviously hasn’t been playing games, so “load” here doesn’t refer to his minutes on the pitch competitively. Instead, it refers to the load he’s been taking on in training, working to return to his best.\n\nArsenal will obviously also need to be extra careful with an injured player who has been out of action for over four months, who already had a setback in November.\n\nOn top of all of that, Arsenal already had a striker and a backup striker available in the squad.\n\nThere wasn’t a desperate need for Havertz in this particular fixture, and sitting on the bench on a bitterly cold day would probably do a lot less good to the forward than remaining home.\n\nArsenal fans will be looking forward to Havertz making regular appearances in the squad over the remainder of the season, but caution is the best way to ensure that happens.",

    "description": "Indiana embarrassed Alabama and Oregon shut out Texas Tech. The Big Ten showed it has the best teams in CFB and is guaranteed to play for the title",
    "fullText": "It was a great week for the Big Ten The national championship game is guaranteed to have a team that resides in the Big Ten Conference. The title game won't feature two Big Ten teams, but there is no doubt that the best game in this playoff and the best game this season might be the upcoming semifinal between two Big Ten teams, Indiana and Oregon.\n\nHere are my takeaways from the Big Ten from this Week's bowl games:\n\nFrom wins like Iowa over Vandy, Illinois over Tennessee, a high-powered offense, all the way to Indiana beating Alabama, the Big Ten showcased they are the best conference in the country. The Big Ten lost Ohio State as a representative, but with the matchup between Oregon and Indiana, that could very well be the team that wins it all. Indiana very well looks like the best team remaining by a wide margin. Texas did get the best of Michigan, but everyone is clearly aware of what has been going on in Michigan prior to that bowl game. It is safe to say that the Big Ten runs college football.\n\nAgainst Alabama, Fernando Mendoza was as good as he could possibly be. Mendoza was 14-16, threw for 192 yards through the air, and threw for 3 passing touchdowns. Many of his other counterparts struggled, while Mendoza continues to win and continues to be the reason why Indiana is winning. At this current moment, Mendoza looks like a sure thing quarterback prospect for the next draft class, and he will make one desperate NFL team very happy.\n\nIndiana was the one team that had a bye week in the College Football Playoff that did not lose. Not only did they not lose to Alabama, but they won the game in the first half. Ty Simpson had no chance, and this was a complete football performance by Indiana and Curt Cignetti. The Hoosiers are undefeated this year, and last season they only lost two games, one of which was in last season's College Football Playoff. Cignetti consistently has this team ready to dominate regardless of the opponent. He has a Big Ten title for the first time in program history, and he is looking for much more this season. This two-year run for Cignetti in Indiana places him as the best coach in college football right now, and it is not close, just like the coaching match between him and Kalen DeBoer on Thursday.\n\nIndiana is a team that has not shown any weakness this season. In games that could have resulted in an upset this season, Indiana has a guy who can win them games in the clutch in Fernando Mendoza. This team has an elite quarterback, they have elite weapons as Omar Cooper Jr. returned versus Alabama, and their defense is just as good as any team left. This team is well coached, and their team is full of players at every level who have been in college football for at least 4 years. The steamrolling of Alabama was a surprise to no one. Indiana made their statement on Thursday and proved it is the team to beat.\n\nThe last time these two teams met, Indiana won 30-20. That game was a battle, and both quarterbacks struggled and faced adversity. Mendoza proved to be the quarterback who battled adversity the best. Against Indiana was the first time Dante Moore struggled and did not have his usual success. For Oregon to win, they will need Dante Moore to be the better quarterback. In all the other areas on their team, Oregon matches up very well against Indiana, and their defense showed that by completely shutting out Texas Tech. Once again, these two teams will deliver one of the best games of this season. In my opinion, whoever wins this game will win the whole thing.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Trojans Wire: Big Ten football teams handled the SEC in New Year's bowl games",

    "fullText": "Chelsea’s sister club Strasbourg drew 1-1 with Nice last night, but the real story was off the pitch, where Liam Rosenior was being asked about his imminent move to take over as Chelsea boss.\n\nIt’s been clear that the Blues are lining him up as their first choice to replace Enzo Maresca after the Italian coach left the club earlier this week. And Rosenior is the obvious next up, given he’s effectively been groomed in Ligue 1 to one day coach at Chelsea.\n\nHis quotes are hardly enthusiastic, however. This chance has come earlier that it was supposed to, and he knows it.\n\nLiam Rosenior managing Strasbourg. (Photo by Justin Setterfield/Getty Images)\n\n“I love this group. I love this club, more than most people probably think. I’ve had the 18 best months of my professional career, for sure, I’ve made many good friends, I have so much respect for the people here,” Rosenior said, confirming the move without confirming it.\n\n“Things aren’t concrete, there may be interest, we’ll see. And at the end of the day, I want to focus on Strasbourg and not other things at the moment. I haven’t discussed anything at this point. I know that they’re (Chelsea) looking for a manager.”\n\nIt’s a tough spot – you can’t turn down a promotion from your boss, but when you know you’re not qualified, it’s a poison pill.\n\nChelsea need their most experienced players to step up and help them in this tricky moment, and Pedro Neto is among them. He spoke a little about how he and his teammates can rise to the challenge.\n\nDavid Datro Fofana is finally at a club where he’s playing and scoring regularly, and he decided to take the chance to apologise to Chelsea fans for not being able to show them his best in his time at the club.",

    "fullText": "Former heavyweight world champion Tyson Fury has announced he will return to boxing in 2026, bringing an end to his latest spell of retirement.\n\nThe 37-year-old Briton last fought in December 2024, when he was beaten for a second time by unified champion Oleksandr Usyk in their heavyweight rematch. Fury confirmed his retirement a month later.\n\nSpeculation over a comeback had grown in recent weeks after Fury shared footage of himself training in Thailand alongside South African boxer Kevin Lerena.\n\nPosting on Instagram on Sunday, Fury said: \"2026 is that year. Return of the Mac. Been away for a while but I'm back now. 37 years old and still punching. Nothing better to do than punch men in the face & get paid for it.\"\n\nFury's return to the ring was widely expected. His most recent retirement was met with scepticism last year, given his history of reversals.\n\nHe previously stepped away from boxing after stopping Dillian Whyte at Wembley Stadium in April 2022, only to return six months later.\n\nQueensberry promoter Frank Warren said he expected Fury to fight again. Saudi Arabia powerbroker Turki Alalshikh had reportedly planned for Fury and long-time rival Anthony Joshua to take separate bouts in the Kingdom early in 2026 before finally meeting later in the year.\n\nJoshua fuelled that possibility after defeating Jake Paul in December, saying he was ready to face Fury next.\n\nThose plans are now uncertain after Joshua was injured in a car crash in Nigeria that claimed the lives of two close friends.\n\nFury enjoyed two reigns as heavyweight champion and boasts a professional record of 34 wins, two defeats - both against Usyk - and one draw with Deontay Wilder.\n\nHe stunned long-reigning champion Wladimir Klitschko in 2015 to claim the WBA (Super), IBF, WBO and The Ring heavyweight titles in Germany.\n\nAfter more than two and a half years away from the ring, during which he addressed mental health struggles, Fury returned in 2018 and regained world champion status by defeating Wilder in 2020 to win the WBC title.\n\nFury has spoken openly about wanting to avenge his defeats by Usyk, who currently holds the WBA (Super), WBC, IBF and WBO belts.\n\nThere appears to be limited appetite among fans for a trilogy, while the Ukrainian has indicated he would prefer to defend his titles against Wilder next.\n\nOne potential route to world-title contention could be a domestic clash with Fabio Wardley, the current WBO champion and another fighter promoted by Warren's Queensberry stable.\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "description": "Discover why Regex destroys LLM performance and how Semantic Redaction protects PII while preserving the context and grammar your AI needs to reason effectively.",
    "fullText": "For the last twenty years, data security has largely been a game of \"Find and Destroy.\"\n\nIn the era of databases and emails, protecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) was a binary problem. If a credit card number appeared in a log, you scrubbed it. If a social security number appeared in an email, you blocked it. The tool of choice was Regular Expressions (Regex). That's simple, rigid pattern matching.\n\nBut we aren't working with databases anymore. We are working with Large Language Models or LLMs (well, we still are working with databases of course, but you know what I mean).\n\nWhen you apply the blunt force of Regex to the delicate probability engines of GenAI, you might secure the data, but you often break the intelligence. To build AI that is both safe and smart, we need to move beyond pattern matching toward Semantic Redaction.\n\nHere is why context matters, and why your redaction strategy is likely killing your LLM’s performance.\n\nImagine you are handing a legal contract to a human lawyer, but before you do, you take a sharpie and blackout every name, date, and corporation. You then ask the lawyer: \"Who is liable in this agreement?\"\n\nThe lawyer can’t answer. Not because they don't know the law, but because you destroyed the relational context necessary to apply it.\n\nRegex-based redaction functions like that black sharpie. It looks for patterns (like [A-Z][a-z]+) and replaces them with a generic mask like [REDACTED] or ******.\n\nLLMs operate on probability. They predict the next token based on the sequence of tokens that came before. When you replace a specific entity with a generic mask, you flatten the probability distribution.\n\n\"John told Mary that he couldn't attend the meeting because Alice was sick.\"\n\nIf you use a simple Regex or keyword list to redact this, you might get:\n\n\"*** told *** that he couldn't attend the *** because *** was sick.\"\n\nTo an LLM (and a human for that matter), this sentence is now mathematically and semantically garbage. The model has lost the subject-object relationships (Attention is all you need, remember?). It doesn't know who told whom, or who (or what) was sick. If you ask the LLM \"Why did John miss the meeting?\", it will hallucinate or refuse to answer because the critical anchors of the narrative are gone.\n\nSemantic Redaction (often powered by Named Entity Recognition or NER or nowadays Small Language Models SLMs) takes a different approach. Instead of destroying the data, it transforms it while preserving the structure.\n\nIt doesn't just look for patterns; it looks for context. It understands that \"Apple\" in \"Apple pie\" is a food, but \"Apple\" in \"Apple Inc.\" is an organization.\n\nMore importantly, it replaces sensitive data with Typed Tokens that maintain referential integrity.\n\nLet’s look at that previous example through the lens of Semantic Redaction.\n\n\"John told Mary that he couldn't attend the meeting because Alice was sick.\"\n\n\"[PERSON_1] told [PERSON_2] that he couldn't attend the meeting because [PERSON_3] was sick.\"\n\nThis looks similar, but to an LLM, it is a world of difference.\n\nType Safety: The model knows [PERSON_1] is a human, not a location or a date. It retains the reasoning that humans have agency and can \"tell\" things.\n\nConsistency: If [PERSON_1] appears later in the document, the model understands it is the same person.\n\nGrammar: The sentence structure remains intact.\n\nNow, if you ask the LLM \"Why did [PERSON_1] miss the meeting?\", it can accurately reason: \"Because [PERSON_3] was sick.\"\n\nThe secret remains safe—the LLM never saw \"John\" or \"Alice\"—but the logic of the interaction was preserved.\n\nAdvanced infrastructure tools like Rehydra go a step beyond simple placeholders. They analyze and preserve non-identifiable attributes (such as grammatical gender) to maintain linguistic fluency.\n\nIn our example, \"John\" is associated with the pronoun \"he.\" If a redaction tool strips away all gender indicators, the LLM might get confused, producing robotic outputs like \"The entity couldn't attend\" or incorrectly guessing \"She couldn't attend.\"\n\nRehydra solves this by attaching metadata to the token. It detects that [PERSON_1] is male and [PERSON_2] is female without revealing who they are. This allows the LLM to use the correct pronouns (he/him or she/her) in its response, ensuring the generated text reads naturally while the actual identities remain completely opaque.\n\nThe ultimate goal of Semantic Redaction isn't just to hide data; it's to make the AI useful. This leads to the concept of Rehydration.\n\nBecause we used unique placeholders ([PERSON_1]), we can create a secure lookup table locally. When the LLM sends back its answer \"The agreement states that [PERSON_3] is liable\" the local system can instantly swap the token back to the real name.\n\nThe user sees the real data. The AI sees the safe tokens. The compliance team sees a clean audit log.\n\nAs we move from simple chatbots to complex autonomous agents, the quality of our inputs matters more than ever. We cannot afford to treat AI prompts like dirty database logs that need to be scrubbed into oblivion.\n\nSecurity doesn't have to mean stupidity. By moving from Regex to Semantic Redaction, we allow our LLMs to reason about our data without ever actually seeing it. We keep the context, and we keep the secrets.\n\nRehydra (Github) provides the infrastructure for semantic anonymization and real-time rehydration. Stop fighting with Regex and start building safe, intelligent AI.",

    "fullText": "I am continuing to set up my home server on FreeBSD 14.3, which is intended to serve as a NAS.\n\nIn the previous post, FreeBSD: introduction to Packet Filter (PF) firewall, we got acquainted with firewalls; the next step is to configure a VPN for access.\n\nThe main idea is to (finally!) connect my “office” and my apartment, and later, perhaps, also connect the server where rtfm.co.ua is currently running so that blog files and database backups can be stored directly on the ZFS mirror pool of the home server.\n\nWhen it came to choosing which specific VPN server to use, I initially thought about OpenVPN – since I’ve worked with it for years, and there are even some blog posts about it on RTFM.\n\nHowever, after giving it some thought, I decided that for a home VPN, solutions like OpenVPN or Pritunl would be a bit of overkill, and I could give WireGuard a try.\n\nThe systems are very different, but in short:\n\nAs a result, WireGuard can be perceived not as a separate service, but as an encrypted network interface, while OpenVPN remains a classic application-based VPN service.\n\nEven the official WireGuard whitepaper is titled “Next Generation Kernel Network Tunnel“.\n\nAnd here is what I want to achieve:\n\nHere is how it looks schematically:\n\nIn FreeBSD (just like in Linux), WireGuard consists of a kernel module + userspace tools: the main “working” part is loaded as a kernel module, and a separate package is installed to interact with it.\n\nEnable WireGuard in /etc/rc.conf:\n\nDon’t start it yet – let’s move on to network configuration.\n\nNext, the system needs to be configured to route packets between the physical interface and the WireGuard interface, and the firewall config needs an update.\n\nEnable IP forwarding from the wg0 interface (which doesn’t exist yet, it will appear when WireGuard starts) to the LAN interface, em0.\n\nUpdate the autostart in /etc/rc.conf:\n\nTo enable forwarding immediately without a reboot – turn it on using sysctl:\n\nThe next step is configuring Packet Filter.\n\nThe current pf config is minimalist, from the previous post:\n\nI’ve added macros to the config, but while writing and testing – I specify all ports and addresses explicitly in the config for better readability.\n\nNow /etc/pf.conf will look like this:\n\nNow we can prepare to start WireGuard.\n\nEverything is very simple here – create the keys, write the config file.\n\nCommunication and cryptography in WireGuard are built on a standard asymmetric key scheme:\n\nSee Key Exchange and Data Packets.\n\nI’m putting the word “server” in quotes because, as mentioned earlier, WireGuard is P2P, not client-server.\n\nAfter installing wireguard-tools, the /usr/local/etc/wireguard directory is created – navigate there and create the private and public keys using wg genkey:\n\nChange the permissions for the private key:\n\nYou can create several different configurations in /usr/local/etc/wireguard/, each on its own port and/or IP and with its own key, to have multiple distinct VPN connections, managing them by filename – wg0, wg1, etc.\n\nThere are even config generators available – https://www.wireguardconfig.com.\n\nSyntax documentation – Wireguard Configuration File Format.\n\nCreate the file /usr/local/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf – just the “server” for now:\n\nThe Interface block defines the parameters for the WireGuard interface wg0 – its IP address, UDP port, and the private key used for traffic encryption.\n\nYou can also specify which DNS to use, whether to update the routing tables on clients (default is true), and script execution with PreUp, PostUp, PreDown, and PostDown.\n\nSince we don’t have any clients yet – let’s move on to setting them up.\n\nTo connect from home to the FreeBSD host with WireGuard – add port forwarding on the office router:\n\nOn the TP-Link Archer AX12, it looks like this:\n\nIf the internet IP in the office is dynamic – the Archer AX12 has a Dynamic DNS setting:\n\nAlthough mine is static, I set up DDNS out of interest using https://www.noip.com.\n\nOn Linux, the process is identical – the modules are in the kernel, so we just need to install the package with the tools.\n\nNavigate to /etc/wireguard/ and create the keys:\n\nChange the permissions for the private key:\n\nNow we can add Peers – clients.\n\nTo do this, we need to add keys on the client and the server:\n\nDefine the config **on the client**, file /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf:\n\nIn AllowedIPs, we specify the networks that will be accessible and added to the routing table (“Acts as a routing table and access control list“).\n\nAdd the Peer **on the server**, the /usr/local/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf file will now look like this:\n\nCheck the status on the client:\n\nThe most important thing to look for is “latest handshake” – it means the client has connected to the server.\n\nVerify SSH from the client to the server:\n\nEnable the wg0 profile on autostart:\n\nAt this point, almost everything is ready – access is established, and everything is working.\n\nHowever, I also want to have direct access from the home laptop to the work laptop and vice versa, as the work laptop doesn’t have a VPN – it doesn’t need one because FreeBSD/NAS is in the same local network.\n\nSo what needs to be done is to set up direct access between the laptops in the home network (192.168.100.0/24) and the office network (192.168.0.0/24), because currently access between the work laptop and the home laptop doesn’t work.\n\nThe situation is currently as follows:\n\nWhile setting this up – comment out block all in /etc/pf.conf; we’ll return to it later.\n\nThe result of what we’re about to do will look like this: the key is the routes. I’ve specifically made this as a diagram to make the following steps easier to understand:\n\nCheck the routes from the home laptop to FreeBSD:\n\nTraffic goes through wg0, and the Source Address for the packet is set as 10.8.0.3.\n\nHowever, on the work laptop, the route to the home laptop goes through 192.168.0.1:\n\nHere, 192.168.0.1 is the default gateway, the office router, which knows nothing about the home network 192.168.100.0/24.\n\nSo first – add a route to the home network via the FreeBSD host:\n\nNow there is contact from the office to home:\n\nBut from home, it still doesn’t work, because from home we send:\n\nBut from the home laptop, the Source IP is set as 10.8.0.3:\n\nBecause the route to 192.168.0.0/24 is specified via the VPN interface wg0:\n\nThe work laptop knows nothing about the 10.8.0.0/24 network and cannot return a response.\n\nSo, add another route on the work laptop:\n\nAnd now there is also access from the home laptop to the work laptop:\n\nTo make these routes permanent – you can do it via NetworkManager CLI.\n\nDelete the ones added manually:\n\nNow we have ping from the office laptop to the home laptop:\n\nAnd from home to the work laptop:\n\nHowever, if we enable block all in pf, the connection from the office to the home laptop will break, because we currently only have rules for the FreeBSD host:\n\nSo, let’s add two more rules – for SSH and ping from the office to the home network:\n\nVerify and reload the pf config:\n\nAnd now we have ping from home to the office:\n\nAnd SSH from the office to home:\n\nThe full /etc/pf.conf is now as follows:\n\nP.S. What an absolute blast – this “traditional networking” instead of all those AWS VPCs and their subnets…",

    "description": "Doctors say 'igloo effect' kept 44-year-old driver in northern Sweden alive despite temperatures of -30C",
    "fullText": "A Swedish man who spent two months snowed inside his car as temperatures outside dropped to -30C is \"awake and able to communicate\", according to the hospital treating him, where stunned doctors believe he was kept alive by the \"igloo effect\" of his vehicle.\n\nThe man, believed to be Peter Skyllberg, 44, who was found near the north-eastern town of Umeå on Friday by passers-by, told police he had been in the car since 19 December without food, surviving only by eating snow and staying inside his warm clothes and sleeping bag.\n\nDr Ulf Segerberg, the chief medical officer at Noorland's University Hospital, said he had never seen a case like it. The man had probably been kept alive, he said, by the natural warming properties of his snowed-in car which would have acted as \"the equivalent of an igloo\".\n\n\"This man obviously had good clothes; he's had a sleeping bag and he's been in a car that's been snowed over,\" said Segerberg. \"Igloos usually have a temperature of a couple of degrees below 0C and if you have good clothes you would survive in those temperatures and be able to preserve your body temperature. Obviously he has managed to preserve his body temperature or he wouldn't have made it because us humans can't really stand being cooled down like reptiles, for instance, which can change the body temperature.\"\n\nTwo months was at the \"upper limit\" of what a person would be able to survive without food, added Segerberg.\n\nSkyllberg was found emaciated and very weak by a pair of snowmobilers who thought they had found a crashed car. They dug down through about a metre of snow to see its driver lying on the back seat in his sleeping bag, according to Ebbe Nyberg, a local police officer.\n\n\"They were amazed at what they found: a man in his mid-40s huddled inside in a sleeping bag, starving and barely able to move or speak,\" Nyberg, working in Vaesterbotten county, was quoted as saying.\n\nA rescuer told the local newspaper Västerbottens-Kuriren: \"It's just incredible that he's alive considering that he had no food, but also since it's been really cold for some time after Christmas.\"\n\nPolice said temperatures around Umeå had fallen to -30C. One doctor, Stefan Branth, said Skyllberg may have survived by going into hibernation mode. \"A bit like a bear that hibernates. Humans can do that. He probably had a body temperature of around 31C which the body adjusted to. Due to the low temperature, not much energy was used up.\"\n\nBut Segerberg said he was \"sceptical\" of this suggestion. \"We can't lower body temperature very much. A little bit we can, but if we lower body temperatures more than just a little bit, we lose consciousness and go into a coma,\" he said, cautioning that it was not his area of expertise.\n\nSkyllberg is being treated in an ordinary ward in the University Hospital, where Segerberg said he was \"feeling well\". It was unclear how he had come to be stranded in the deserted lane.\n\nSegerberg said that, even in a part of the world where sub-zero temperatures and heavy snow are the norm, this case was unusual. \"There have been cases of people caught out in the mountains, and if they can dig themselves down in the snow they are able to survive and be found. But there must be something special in this case.\"",

    "fullText": "Less than 24 hours after throngs of ecstatic supporters poured into Manhattan for his history-making inauguration, Zohran Mamdani began his first full day of work with a routine familiar to many New Yorkers: trudging to the subway from a cramped apartment.\n\nBundled against the frigid temperature and seemingly fighting off a cold, he set out Friday morning from the one-bedroom apartment in Queens that he shares with his wife. But unlike most commuters, Mamdani’s trip was documented by a photo and video crew, and periodically interrupted by neighbors wishing him luck.\n\nThe 34-year-old democratic socialist, whose victory was hailed as a watershed moment for the progressive movement, has now begun the task of running the nation’s largest city: signing orders, announcing appointments, facing questions from the press — and answering for some of the actions he took in his first hours.\n\nBut first, the symbolism-laden day one commute.\n\nFlanked by security guards and a small clutch of aides on a Manhattan-bound train, he agreed to several selfies with wide-eyed riders, then moved to a corner seat of the train to review his briefing materials.\n\nWhen a pair of French tourists, confused by the hubbub, approached Mamdani, he introduced himself as “the new mayor of New York.” They seemed doubtful. He held up the morning’s copy of the New York Daily News, featuring his smiling face, as proof.\n\nMamdani, a Democrat, is hardly alone among city mayors in using the transit system to communicate relatability. His predecessor, Eric Adams, also rode the subway on his first day, and both Bill de Blasio and Michael Bloomberg made a habit out of it, particularly when seeking to make a political point.\n\nWithin minutes of Mamdani entering City Hall, the images of him riding public transit had lit up social media.\n\nIf the ride served as a well-timed photo-op, it also seemed to reflect Mamdani’s pledge, made in his inaugural speech, to ensure his “government looks and lives like the people it represents.”\n\nHis other early actions have also seemed to underscore that priority.\n\nAfter centering much of his campaign on making rent cheaper for New Yorkers, Mamdani raced from his inauguration ceremony Thursday to a Brooklyn apartment building lobby, drawing boisterous cheers from the tenants union as he pledged that the city would ramp up an ongoing legal fight against the allegedly negligent landlord.\n\nMamdani’s next action, meanwhile, showed the unusual scrutiny faced by his nascent administration, particularly around his criticism of Israel and outspoken support for the Palestinian cause.\n\nIn an effort to give his government a “clean slate,” he revoked a slate of executive orders issued by Adams late in his term, including two related to Israel: one that officially adopted a contentious definition of antisemitism that includes certain criticism of Israel, and another barring city agencies and employees from boycotting or divesting from the country.\n\nThe move drew swift backlash from some Jewish groups, including allegations from the Israeli government posted to social media that Mamdani had poured “antisemitic gasoline on an open fire.”\n\nWhen a journalist on Friday asked about the revoked orders, Mamdani read from prepared remarks, promising his administration would be “relentless in its effort to combat hate and division.” He noted that he had left in place the Mayor’s Office to Combat Antisemitism.\n\nMamdani also announced the creation of a “mass engagement” office, which he said would continue the work his campaign’s field operation did to bring more New Yorkers into the political fold.\n\nRinged by supporters and passersby who stood several rows deep, phones in the air, to catch a glimpse of the new mayor, Mamdani then acknowledged the weight of the current moment.\n\n“We have an opportunity where New Yorkers are allowing themselves to believe in the possibility of city government once again,” he said. “That is not a belief that will sustain itself in the absence of action.”\n\nAlso on Mamdani’s to-do list: Moving to the mayor’s official residence, a stately mansion in the Upper East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, before the lease on his Queens apartment ends later this month.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "description": "Just one month before their fifth wedding anniversary, the same setting where an Ohio couple began their life together became the site of unspeakable tragedy.",
    "fullText": "The immense joy of Spencer and Monique Tepe was unmistakable on their wedding day in a 2021 video shared by the family, which captured them exchanging vows. The then newlyweds embraced and laughed in their Columbus, Ohio, home as friends and loved ones cheered them.\n\nBut just one month before their fifth anniversary, the same setting where the couple began their life together became the site of unspeakable tragedy. The respected dentist, 37, and his 39-year-old wife, a stay-at-home mother, were found dead on Tuesday after being gunned down in their upscale home while their two young children were inside.\n\nA memorial of roses and sunflowers now grows outside the home as news of the shocking killings spread nationwide just days after Christmas, generating more questions than answers.\n\nLaw enforcement has been reluctant to disclose any details about a possible suspect or motive but said the killer or killers of the young couple remain on the loose. Even more mysterious, police revealed there were no obvious signs of forced entry, and no firearm was found at the scene, CNN affiliate WSYX reported.\n\nPolice are asking the public for any information on a case they say is being investigated as a double homicide, not a murder-suicide.\n\nHere’s what we know and don’t know about the tragedy:\n\nSpencer Tepe had rarely missed work at Athens Dental Depot, located about 75 miles southeast of the family’s Columbus home, and he and his wife were always responsive, according to the owner of his practice, Dr. Mark Valrose, CNN affiliate WSYX reported.\n\nBut on Tuesday morning, he didn’t show up for work, spurring concern from his colleagues that continued to grow when they could not get in touch with him or his wife, according to 911 calls reported by WSYX.\n\nValrose made the first 911 call at around 8:58 a.m. and asked police to conduct a wellness check, telling the dispatcher: “He is always on time, and he would contact us if there were any issues,” according to the recording.\n\n“I don’t know how else to say this, but we are very, very concerned. This is very out of character for him,” he continued. “We can’t get in touch with his wife, which is probably the more concerning thing.”\n\nAt 9:22 a.m., an officer arrived at the home to perform the welfare check, but no one answered the door, WSYX reported, citing police records.\n\nAround 30 minutes later, Tepe’s colleagues and a friend arrived at the home, but also did not get a response, the dispatch records showed. A man at the scene also called 911 at 9:56 a.m., saying he heard children crying inside.\n\n“I can hear kids inside, and I swear I think I heard one yell,” the caller said, according to dispatch audio. “But we can’t get in. At this point, I don’t know if I need to break the door in to get in the house or what.”\n\nTwo minutes later, another colleague of Tepe called 911 to say they had been unable to reach him for about three hours, according to the recordings obtained by WSYX.\n\nAround 10:03 a.m., a friend of Tepe, who said the two last spoke the day before, was audibly distressed as he called 911: “There’s a body,” he reported.\n\n“Our friend wasn’t answering his phone … we just came here and he appears dead,” the friend said.\n\nOfficers found the bodies of Spencer Tepe and Monique Tepe in their home in the Weinland Park neighborhood, Columbus police said.\n\nTheir two children, ages 1 and 4, were also found unharmed in the residence, police said.\n\nColumbus police have not issued any warnings to the community about an ongoing threat, and the agency did not respond to CNN’s questions about the timing of the killings, whether the Tepes were specifically targeted or any information about a suspect or motive.\n\nThe Franklin County Coroner’s Office told CNN autopsy reports can take between eight and 10 weeks to complete. A police incident report from Tuesday said Spencer and Monique Tepe were victims of homicide.\n\nThere is a police crime camera situated on a utility pole at an intersection located a few hundred feet from the Tepes’ home, according to The Columbus Dispatch. CNN has asked police whether any neighborhood cameras captured any relevant clues about what took place.\n\nTo help zero in on a motive and possible suspects, investigators will examine forensics, the possible entry of the killer, whether anything was stolen from the home and the Tepe family’s background to determine any further threat to the rest of the community, according to CNN Senior National Security Analyst Juliette Kayyem.\n\nWithout any recovered firearm, it’s not surprising detectives would investigate the deaths as a double homicide and not a murder-suicide, Kayyem said. “The other clue is, of course, the children are left safe.”\n\nEither of two scenarios for how the crime unfolded seems to be most likely, Kayyem said: A “stranger at the door who just happens to kill this couple, or some narrative that might explain why they were targeted.”\n\nThis type of crime is “exceptionally rare” given there were no signs of forced entry, she continued. “… You’re going to look at people who they may have known or people who knew where they lived, unfortunately, and begin there.”\n\n“Maybe this was random. But the … national data suggests both how uncommon this is as well as the likelihood that there may be someone who knew them who was involved with this,” Kayyem said.\n\nSpencer and Monique Tepe “shared a beautiful, strong and deeply happy relationship,” bonded by a love of travel, laughter and a mission to “build a life rooted in love,” said their family.\n\n“We are heartbroken beyond words,” reads the statement on behalf of the Tepe family.\n\nAs the devastating loss of the couple permeates their community, the family said they are “committed to seeing this tragedy fully and fairly brought to justice” and to honoring them by protecting the future of their beloved children, who are now in the care of relatives.\n\nMeanwhile, Spencer Tepe’s employer, Athens Dental Depot, announced its closure for the rest of the week as they shared news of the “sudden passing” of the couple on Facebook.\n\n“He will be deeply missed by our team and the many patients he cared for over the years. Our thoughts and sincerest condolences are with their families and loved ones during this very difficult time.”\n\nSpencer Tepe, a graduate of Ohio State University and a member of the American Dental Association, was a “devoted and proud father, a loving partner, and a friend to everyone he met,” his family said.\n\nHe was fluent in Spanish, a major fan of the Bengals and Buckeyes football teams and had a generous and energetic spirit, they said.\n\nHis wife Monique Tepe had a background in childhood education and “brought care and intention into everything she did,” their family said. She was described as a loving, patient and joyful mother “whose warmth defined her.”\n\nThe couple, their family said, were “extraordinary people whose lives were filled with love, joy, and a deep connection to others.”\n\nCNN’s Holly Yan, Caroll Alvarado and Yan Kaner contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "TEL AVIV (AP) — Israel’s decision to revoke the licenses of more than three dozen humanitarian organizations this week has aid groups scrambling to grapple with what this means for their operations in Gaza and their ability to help tens of thousands of struggling Palestinians.\n\nThe 37 groups represent some of the most prominent of the more than 100 independent nongovernmental organizations working in Gaza, alongside United Nations agencies. Those banned include Doctors Without Borders, the Norwegian Refugee Council, Oxfam and Medical Aid for Palestinians.\n\nThe groups do everything from providing tents and water to supporting clinics and medical facilities. The overall impact, however, remains unclear.\n\nThe most immediate impact of the license revocation is that Israel will no longer allow the groups to bring supplies into the Gaza Strip or send international staffers into the territory. Israel says all suspended groups have to halt their operations by March 1.\n\nSome groups have already been barred from bringing in aid. The Norwegian Refugee Council, for example, said it has not been allowed to bring in supplies in 10 months, leaving it distributing tents and aid brought in by other groups.\n\nIsrael says the banned groups make up only a small part of aid operations in Gaza.\n\nBut aid officials say they fulfill crucial specific functions. In a joint statement Tuesday, the U.N. and leading NGOs said the organizations that are still licensed by Israel “are nowhere near the number required just to meet immediate and basic needs” in Gaza.\n\nThe ban further strains aid operations even as Gaza’s over 2 million Palestinians still face a humanitarian crisis more than 12 weeks into a ceasefire. The U.N. says that although famine has been staved off, more than a quarter of families still eat only one meal a day and food prices remain out of reach for many; more than 1 million people need better tents as winter storms lash the territory.\n\nWhy were their licenses revoked?\n\nEarlier this year, Israel introduced strict new registration requirements for aid agencies working in Gaza. Most notably, it required groups to provide the names and personal details of local and international staff and said it would ban groups for a long list of criticisms of Israel.\n\nThe registration process is overseen by Israel’s Ministry for Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism, led by a far-right member of the ruling Likud party.\n\nIsrael says the rules aim to prevent Hamas and other militants from infiltrating the groups, something it has said was happening throughout the 2-year-old war. The U.N., which leads the massive aid program in Gaza, and independent groups deny the allegations and Israeli claims of major diversion of aid supplies by Hamas.\n\nAid organizations say they did not comply, in part, because they feared that handing over staff information could endanger them. More than 500 aid workers have been killed in Gaza during the war, according to the United Nations.\n\nIsrael denies targeting aid workers. But the group say Israel has been vague about how it would use the data.\n\nThe groups also said Israel was vague about how it would use the data.\n\n“Demanding staff lists as a condition for access to territory is an outrageous overreach,” Doctors Without Borders, known by its French acronym MSF, said Friday. It said Israeli officials had refused its attempts to find alternatives.\n\nA December report on MSF issued by an Israeli government team recommended rejection of the group’s license. It pointed primarily to statements by the group criticizing Israel, including referring to its campaign in Gaza as genocide and calling its monthslong ban on food entering the territory earlier this year as “a starvation tactic.” It said the statements violated neutrality and constituted “delegitimization of Israel.”\n\nThe report also repeated claims that an MSF employee killed in by an Israeli airstrike in 2024 was an operative with the Islamic Jihad militant group. That, it said, suggested MSF “maintains connections with a terrorist group.”\n\nMSF on Friday denied the allegations, saying it would “never knowingly employ anyone involved in military activities.” It said that its statements cited by Israel simply described the destruction its teams witnessed in Gaza.\n\n“The fault lies with those committing these atrocities, not with those who speak of them,” it said.\n\nAid groups have a week from Dec. 31 to appeal the process.\n\nMedical services could see biggest impact\n\nIndependent NGOs play a major role in propping up Gaza’s health sector, devastated by two years of Israeli bombardment and restrictions on supplies.\n\nMSF said Israel’s decision would have a catastrophic impact on its work in Gaza, where it provides funding and international staff for six hospitals as well as running two field hospitals and eight primary health centers, clinics and medical points. It also runs two of Gaza’s five stabilization centers helping children with severe malnutrition.\n\nIts teams treated 100,000 trauma cases, performed surgeries on 10,000 patients and handled a third of Gaza’s births, the group says. It has 60 international staffers in the West Bank and Gaza and more than 1,200 local staff — most medical professionals.\n\nSince the ceasefire began in early October, MSF has brought in about 7% of the 2,239 tons (2,032 metric tonnes) of medical supplies that Israel has allowed into Gaza, according to a U.N. tracking dashboard. That makes it the largest provider of medical supplies after U.N. agencies and the Red Cross, according to the dashboard.\n\nMedecins du Monde, another group whose license is being halted, runs another four primary health clinics.\n\nAid groups say the most immediate impact will likely be the inability to send international staff into Gaza.\n\nForeign staff provide key technical expertise and emotional support for their Palestinian colleagues.\n\n“Having international presence in Gaza is a morale booster for our staff who are already feeling isolated,” said Shaina Low, communications adviser for the Norwegian Refugee Council, which is one of the main NGOs providing shelter supplies and fresh water to displaced people.\n\nNRC has roughly 30 international staff who rotate in and out of Gaza working alongside some 70 Palestinians.\n\nWhile any operations by the 37 groups in the West Bank will likely remain open, those with offices in east Jerusalem, which Israel considers its territory, might have to close.\n\nMany of the 37 groups already had been blocked from bringing supplies into Gaza since March, said Bushra Khalidi, Oxfam's policy lead for Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories.\n\nWhat changes with the formal license revocation is “that these practices are now formalized, giving Israel full impunity to restrict operations and shut out organizations it disagrees with,” she said.\n\nSome of the groups have turned to buying supplies within Gaza rather than bringing them in, but that is slower and more expensive, she said. Other groups dug into reserve stocks, pared down distribution and had to work with broken or heavily repaired equipment because they couldn’t bring in new ones.\n\nAmed Khan, an American humanitarian philanthropist who has been privately donating medicine and emergency nutrition for children to Gaza, said the impact extends beyond the aid groups.\n\nHe relies on NGOs to receive and distribute the supplies, but the fewer groups that Israel approves, the harder it is to find one.\n\n“It’s death by bureaucracy,” he said.",

    "description": "In a job market clogged with applications, the old advice no longer works. Here's how to choose the strategy that gives you the best odds.",
    "fullText": "If your New Year's resolution is to land a job, you're up against daunting odds. When you apply to the average white-collar job right now, as I recently reported, you have a 0.4% chance of actually landing it.\n\nSo what's a smart job seeker actually to do in this apocalyptic market? The most foundational step in every search today, I've come to believe, is deciding on an overarching strategy that will determine everything else you do. Given the extraordinary volume of applications that are clogging up the market, do you adapt by applying to as many jobs as humanly possible? Or do you go the opposite way and focus all your energy on a very small number of your dream jobs? It's a choice every job seeker confronts sooner or later: Do you optimize for volume or precision?\n\nI hesitate to give advice in a market where even the perfect approach won't guarantee success. Even if you're struggling — pretty much everyone who's looking right now is — it doesn't mean you're doing anything wrong. But I've spent a lot of time thinking through this dilemma over the last two years, talking to dozens of experts and job seekers. Here's where I've landed.\n\nAssuming I'm catching you at the beginning of your job search, start with the precision approach. To make this work, you have to do the one thing everyone hates: network. Tell everyone you know you're looking. Call up old colleagues; comb through your alumni network; mention your search to friends of friends. Ask them if they know if their companies are hiring, what they think about working there, and if they know anyone else who's hiring.\n\nEventually, you'll run out of people to apologetically bug. So the next step is to reach out to those you don't know, by looking up the people who have the jobs you want at the companies you want to work for. A lot of these people will ignore you, and I get that cold-messaging strangers feels cringey. But if you don't know anyone inside your dream companies, it's absolutely worth a try (for a sample of such a message, read my job-searching guide from a year ago).\n\nIf this sounds exhausting, it is. You can't do this kind of networking with hundreds of companies, so you'll need to pick your targets. And when you do, make sure you're picking the kind of roles and companies you're exceptionally qualified for. Don't overshoot: This isn't the market to switch industries, let alone entire occupations, and it's not the moment to chase a big promotion. You should be able to check pretty much every box in the job description.\n\nWhy is this networking important? First, you might find out about job openings before they're publicly posted — which will give you a chance to stand out before hundreds of other candidates storm in. Even more crucial, having this network gives you a community of people you can turn to for a referral when you see open jobs at their companies. With a referral, you'll be much more likely to get through to the initial screening, and from there, you'll also be much more likely to survive through multiple rounds of interviews. In the third quarter of 2025, candidates with a referral had an average 4.4% chance of landing every job they applied for, according to the hiring software provider Greenhouse. It's far from a guarantee, but that's 10 times better than if you cold-apply.\n\nThere are other reasons the precision approach is superior. First, by networking, you learn a lot about the companies you're applying to, which will help you know whether you'd actually enjoy the job (or at least tolerate it). By applying to fewer jobs, you'll also have more time to customize each résumé and cover letter to them. Yes, there are AI tools that help you do this quickly, but they only get you so far. You'll need to spend some time choosing the exact accomplishments in your career you'll want to highlight, based on the specifics of the role. Even better is if you learn something useful about the role from your networking, so you can distinguish yourself further by showing that you have what the hiring manager is actually looking for.\n\nBecause of all these benefits of networking, some experts will go as far as to tell you to never cold-apply to a job. I'm not such an absolutist. After all, you only know so many people — and only so many strangers will reply to your LinkedIn messages. So once you've done all the networking you possibly can, it's worth casting a wider net and applying to places where you don't have any connections. This hybrid approach is one that Alvin Roth, a Nobel Prize-winning economist who's the leading expert on matching markets, also recommends. \"I don't know how productive it is,\" he says. \"But it's also not very costly.\" If it only takes a few clicks, what's a few more applications?\n\nSebastian Snijder, a recruiter, has a good formula for this. You should still put in the extra effort when you're applying to the jobs that are the best fit, he says: Think networking, tailoring your resume, etc. Because the market is so bad right now, it's also worth buying a little extra insurance by creating a generic resume and using that to mass-apply to other jobs that are a slightly worse fit. \"It's ok right now to take a job,\" he says, \"even if it's not your dream job.\"\n\nIf you decide to cold-apply, here are a few tips. First, I know a lot of people who see a job posting — and then hem and haw for a week before they actually pull the trigger. Don't do this! With application volumes this high, recruiters often take down job openings after a few days — and even if they don't, chances are they'll stop reviewing résumés after the first hundred or so that have rolled in. If you see a posting that's already gotten 1,000 applicants, don't bother. You're not going to get it.\n\nSecond, find a way to show the company you're interested. You could follow the company on LinkedIn; recruiters often filter for candidates who do this. You could also use the job-searching equivalent of \"the rose\" — a way to tell a company you really want to work there, the way dating apps give you a chance to tell someone you really like them. On LinkedIn, you can mark three applications a month as a \"Top Choice,\" which requires you to pay for a premium subscription. On Greenhouse, you can choose one job a month as a \"Dream Job,\" and you can do this for free (this only works with companies that use its hiring software, and you need to make an account on Greenhouse's website for candidates).\n\nAgain, don't expect much from the jobs you apply to with the volume approach. But as long as you keep your expectations low, I still think it's worth a shot. According to Greenhouse, more than half of hires are still cold applicants — simply because cold applications make up 95% of all submissions — even though each individual cold applicant has a far lower chance of making it through than someone with a connection.\n\nThe best of the hybrid approaches I heard about was from a job seeker I'll call James, who lost his consulting job last year. Initially, he was taking a volume approach, applying to eight to 10 jobs a day. But after the first month, he started focusing on fewer applications — about three to five a day — and found that he was getting more callbacks. He put most of his energy into a handful of big-name companies he really wanted to work for, and he had friends at most of those companies who offered to refer him. Some even invited him to their offices so he could get a feel for what it'd be like to work there. With those dream companies, he kept applying over and over again.\n\nThat's not to say that he didn't send cold applications: He sent out plenty. Importantly, though, he gave himself a few guardrails when he was taking the volume approach. He didn't bother applying to roles he didn't have direct experience doing, even if he knew he had the soft skills to learn the job. And he only applied to positions that had been posted within the last day or two.\n\nRather than seeing the precision and volume approaches as binary choices, it's more helpful to think of them as opposite ends of a spectrum. If you mark total precision as a 1 and total volume as a 5, where you fall on that spectrum depends on a few factors. One is experience. The farther along you are in your career and the more specialized your skillset, the smaller your universe of appropriate jobs — which means there aren't that many to mass-apply to in the first place. That means you should lean more toward precision: a 2 on the scale. If you just graduated from college, you have less experience to distinguish yourself from everyone else, and you can still take your career in all kinds of directions. You also probably don't have that many professional contacts yet. So it makes more sense to opt a little more for volume: a 4 on the scale.\n\nAnother factor is how long you can afford to hold out for the right role to come along. The more time you have, the more you should lean toward the precision approach. You don't want to hold out for so long that your skills end up going stale, but if you can afford the potentially longer wait, it's generally worth going all in on the jobs you really want (a 1.5 on the scale). If you're maximizing for the shortest possible search, go for a fully hybrid approach (a 3). If you land one of the random roles you mass-applied to, take it for now and start looking again when the market improves.\n\nIn the end, that wasn't a compromise James had to make. After submitting 400 applications over the course of five months, he was offered a job at one of his dream employers, a large bank, around the 10th try at the company. Part of that was luck: He happened to have friends at many of the companies he wanted to work for, including the bank. But the rest was being thoughtful about his game plan and executing on it. He invested most of his energy in the places where he had strong connections, and he applied elsewhere, too, to hedge his bets.\n\n\"I wouldn't say I was perfect,\" he says. \"But my strategy was to keep iterating.\"\n\nHappy New Year, everyone. And godspeed.\n\nAki Ito is a chief correspondent at Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "Student-loan forgiveness isn't certain — but taxes are.\n\nOn January 1, a provision in former President Joe Biden's 2021 American Rescue Plan that made student-loan forgiveness tax-free expired. It means that student-loan borrowers who qualify for student-loan forgiveness in 2026 could face thousands of dollars in new taxes alongside their debt relief.\n\nIt's a concern for borrowers who are close to reaching their qualifying number of payments on an income-driven repayment plan or the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which forgives student debt for government and nonprofit workers after 10 years of qualifying payments.\n\nFor example, Misty Knapp, a 59-year-old student-loan borrower enrolled in PSLF, told Business Insider that she's just six payments away from reaching debt relief, but she doesn't think she can afford the taxes that would come with the forgiveness.\n\n\"I don't know what that's going to look like, but if I'm taxed on the amount that's forgiven, that would be a lot of money,\" Knapp said.\n\nAdditionally, the Department of Education was working through a backlog of income-based repayment applications in 2025, meaning some borrowers who reached their payment threshold were left waiting for relief.\n\nThe department reached an agreement with the American Federation of Teachers in October to make sure that if a borrower reached their qualifying number of payments in 2025, they would not be subject to the new 2026 taxes, even if the department was still processing their claim in the new year.\n\nStill, the agreement said that the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department would have the \"final say\" on whether a borrower's forgiveness would count as taxable income, not the Department of Education.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers expressed concern with what they called the looming \"tax bomb\" set to hit borrowers. In November, Sen. Elizabeth Warren led some of her colleagues in sending a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, urging him to use his authority to reverse the expiration of the tax-free provision.\n\nThe lawmakers cited an analysis from advocacy group Protect Borrowers, which found that the average borrower on an income-driven repayment plan who receives debt relief could face losses between $5,800 and $10,000.\n\n\"By punishing IDR beneficiaries with massive tax bills, the federal government undermines the very purpose of the IDR program and reneges on its promises to borrowers,\" the lawmakers wrote.",

    "description": "Kari Cobham thought a stroke at 29 would derail her career. Instead, it redefined her approach to work and leadership.",
    "fullText": "A stroke at just 29 years old wasn't in my career plan.\n\nThey can happen at any age, and one in five women in the US will experience one. But the average age for Black women is 69, not 29. I was decades ahead of schedule.\n\nAt the time, I lived in Palm Coast, a burgeoning central Florida city between St. Augustine and Daytona Beach, and had just returned from a trip home to Trinidad and Tobago. I was vice president of media and communications for a busy hospitality company and seemingly in the best shape of my life, training for a half-marathon.\n\nI was a picture of health. Then came the stroke.\n\nWithin weeks of the stroke in 2011 — later traced, in part, to hormonal birth control — I was back in meetings, running communications and social media for the hospitality company where I'd worked for over a year.\n\nI learned quickly that in crisis, healing isn't optional — and neither is leadership.\n\nI was off work for a few weeks, but without paid leave I had to return sooner than doctors advised. I worked from home for a few months since I still couldn't drive.\n\nI loved the challenge of the work, the way no day was ever the same, and I had thrived on that pace. But I was still recovering. Winded by the smallest physical activity, I struggled with memory, and words sometimes came out scrambled or not at all. I was in and out of outpatient appointments.\n\nStill, I tried to keep up with new initiatives as if nothing had happened.\n\nMy coworkers were sympathetic, but with no formal HR and a fast-moving team, there was little room for weakness. People noticed when I struggled to articulate myself or keep up. I noticed it even more. I felt like I was drowning, fighting to heal and failing at work.\n\nIt was like running on a treadmill set too fast. I just hadn't realized I had the power and the responsibility to change the speed. Slowly, I began to understand that recovery required both time and empathy, and that as leaders, we owe people the time and understanding I hadn't known how to ask for.\n\nLess than a year later, I was pregnant with my first child and, on top of my recovery, I was helping to open two new attractions and restaurants. It seemed to be an easy pregnancy, and I stayed active with yoga and running, often waddling between properties under renovation, keeping up with the job's demands.\n\nBut I held onto the lessons I'd been learning in stroke recovery. I needed balance, not burnout, if I wanted to manage health and motherhood.\n\nIt was a turning point: realizing that leadership isn't about pushing through, but knowing when to take stock, adjust, and create space for the life changes that matter more than the work.\n\nI wasn't leading a team then, but the experience shaped the leader I wanted to be and the kind of culture I wanted to work in. My first big adjustment? A new job.\n\nEager for a return to journalism, I joined a TV newsroom in Orlando months later as executive producer of social media, with a new baby at home. I immediately plunged into high-pressure coverage of the George Zimmerman trial in 2013. My job was to build a social media strategy around both the trial and daily reporting, while co-leading a digital team.\n\nAt home, I was nursing and sleep-deprived. At work, I dozed off in morning pitch meetings. I caught every daycare illness my daughter brought home and often had to duck out for urgent care visits or daycare pickups. On those days, coverage had to move forward without me.\n\nYears later, I still laugh with one of those teammates about the chaos we survived, from publishing stories while my infant daughter slept in her car seat beneath my desk to racing through relentless breaking news days.\n\nBut that season taught me something fundamental: Leadership in crisis isn't about being everywhere at once, it's about building trust and capacity in others to carry the work forward.\n\nAfter a few more years in various digital news roles, I moved into nonprofit news and now run a journalism fellowship for alumni of historically Black colleges and universities. Looking back, the stroke and the experiences that came after it taught me important lessons I still carry with me.\n\nMost of all, I've learned that a crisis doesn't disqualify anyone from leading. It simply reshapes how we lead, pushing us toward empathy, clarity, and adaptability. These days, when someone on my team needs time, I think back to 29-year-old me, trying to outrun recovery.\n\nI give them the space I wish I'd given myself and try to encourage them to see resilience differently: not powering through at all costs, but creating conditions that allow us, and the people we manage, to carry on.\n\nI thought a stroke at 29 would derail my career. Instead, it redefined my philosophy on work and leadership. Recovery, motherhood, and leading through hard times have stayed with me far longer than any job. I have two kids now and a flexible job, and I continue to try to give myself grace.\n\nIt was never about being all-knowing, invincible, or always showing up at full strength. It was always about showing up with honesty, trust, and the courage to adapt.\n\nKari Cobham, the founding director of fellowships at The 19th News, is an award-winning writer with over two decades of experience in journalism and is working on a book tying her chronic illness to the generational trauma endured by the women in her family (Danielle Chiotti, Upstart Crow). She lives in Atlanta with her two kids, two kittens, and a collection of antique typewriters.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Diarmuid Early, the 40-year-old winner of the 2025 Microsoft Excel World Championship. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been in the Excel business for about 20 years.\n\nI played around with it a little bit in college and started using it professionally at Boston Consulting Group. Then I spent 10 years at Deutsche Bank as a business manager. It was lots of data analysis and reporting on financials.\n\nI've been doing my own thing for about six years now, so I've pretty much used Excel my entire career.\n\nWinning the Excel World Championship felt great. I've been a long-term underperformer in the postseason. I've been first or second seed going into the knockouts every year. I've made it to the final stage in Las Vegas the last couple of years, but I think fifth was my best finish before.\n\nMy number one tip for office workers is to believe that there is a better way.\n\nWhenever you find, 'Oh god, I've been copying and pasting this for the last 10 minutes, and I still have 15 minutes to go,' whenever you find yourself doing something that is manual and repetitive, it is very likely that Excel has a better way to do it.\n\nIt is very likely that, if you ask Google or ChatGPT a brief description of what you need, 1,000 or more other people have wanted to do the same thing over the years.\n\nIn my experience, 80% of the things I've ever struggled with in Excel, if I Google it with a reasonably crisp description, there's a post out there somewhere saying how to do it.\n\nLearning to use the SUMIFS function is probably going to take you longer the first time than just doing it yourself. But it's going to be a little bit faster the second time, a lot faster the third time, and one bajillion times faster over the thousand times you have to do it over your career.\n\nIt's also much less likely to be wrong or have unexplainable errors that you will get if you're doing it manually.\n\nIt'll take you a little longer the first time, but if you're the most junior, new employee at a company, they kind of expect you to be stupid and take ages to do things. If you are stupid and take ages the first time, and the second time you do it 10 times faster, the payoff over six months, not to mention your career, is pretty huge.\n\nAs you start to learn more of those things and start to stitch them together to do more complex things, the payoff is exponential.\n\nIt's great to be able to very, very quickly zoom through and say, \"The answer is seven.\" If you get to that quickly, you get more time to say: \"Does it make any sense that the answer is seven?\"\n\nIt's the thing that the junior bankers, the junior consultants, are least likely to do. They see it as their job to turn the crank on the model, hand over the answer, and the next person above them on the chain says: What does this mean? What's the insight? Does it make sense?\n\nTaking the time to do that yourself and then communicating that gets you a lot more credibility. It also makes you a lot more likely to spot your own stupid mistakes until someone spots them for you.\n\nThe thing that I find most horrifying is when I see a formula that is 50 different numbers together in the form: A1 + B3 + C5 + D10. Someone has obviously hand-typed them all or, plus click plus click plus click.\n\nThe amount of time that takes, and the chances that you will misclick one time and have something wrong you'll never be able to find, is really high.\n\nThat's one of the more entry-level ways to go down a dark path. There's basically, at every level of Excel skill, there's the thing you're doing wrong that you don't realize you're doing wrong until you get to the next level. There are problems all the way up.\n\nWhen it gets there, I think AI will be very helpful in taking people from bad to not bad, or maybe even bad to good. It's probably not going to be much help to people like me who are already quite experienced.\n\nIf it gets to a level where it can teach me new things in Excel, then there's not much room left for human Excel users.\n\nI've got 50,000 hacks. I used to do a lot of Excel training in my BCG days. Every now and again you would teach someone something, and you'd see this look of combined joy and horror on their face. You subsequently find out: \"This is the thing that, if I knew this last night, I would not have had to work until 2 a.m..\"\n\nThat is the person who will never forget what you just taught them.",

    "description": "\"It's going to be a lifetime thing.\"",
    "fullText": "Many people who successfully lost weight on Ozempic and other GLP-1 agonist drugs are having trouble weaning themselves off the injectables, according to the BBC, because the hunger for food comes roaring back with a vengeance — and hence the pounds start creeping up again, hinting that patients are likely to develop life-long dependencies on the substances.\n\n“For the first 38 years of my life, I was overweight — now I’m six stone (38kg) [83 pounds] lighter,” Tanya Hall, a Wegovy user who can’t get off the drug, told the news organization. “Therefore, there’s part of me that feels like there’s an addiction to keep it going because it makes me feel the way that I feel, it makes me feel in control.”\n\nThis is borne out by research that found patients who stop using these medications often gain much of their weight back. That’s why you have celebrities like Oprah, who told People Magazine last month that she plans to stay on it indefinitely. The implication: many users will have to treat their obesity as a chronic condition and will need to stay on these drugs for the rest of their lives.\n\n“It’s going to be a lifetime thing,” Oprah said. “I’m on high blood pressure medication, and if I go off the high blood pressure medication, my blood pressure is going to go up. The same thing is true now, I realize, with these medications. I’ve proven to myself I need it.”\n\nFor patients who do get off the drugs, they tend to gain two thirds of their lost weight back, according to research by Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk. Physician Hussain Al-Zubaidi told the BBC that he’s seen patients gain 60 to 80 percent back of the weight they lost.\n\nIt might seem hopeless task, but all is not lost, according to Al-Zubaidi. He said patients should have an “exit strategy” in which they have made healthier lifestyle changes while on the injectables; the lifestyle changes can sustain the weight loss once they are completely off the drugs.\n\nThat’s what happened to Ellen Ogley, who told the BBC that she lost 48.5 pounds while on Eli Lily’s GLP-1 drug Mounjaro. While on the medication, she established healthier eating habits and incorporated excerise into her routine. Even off the drugs for some time, she’s been able to maintain her weight loss.\n\n“I want people to know that life after Mounjaro can be sustainable as well,” she said.\n\nMore on Ozempic: People Jabbing Themselves With Black Market “GLP-3” Drugs",

    "description": "This software engineer couldn't land a Big Tech job — but says his Walmart role gave him everything he needed.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kanish Shah, a 26-year-old software engineer at Walmart who lives in Milpitas, California. Business Insider has verified his employment with documentation. His words have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI moved to the US from India in August 2021 to pursue a master's degree in computer science at the University of Southern California. Soon after, I began looking for a summer internship — but things didn't go as planned.\n\nLike many aspiring software engineers, I was excited about the idea of working at a Big Tech company like Google, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, or Netflix. I targeted those tech giants during my internship search, but the competition was intense. I ended up being rejected by all of them, which was disappointing.\n\nIt wasn't just the tech giants that turned me down. I ended up applying to hundreds of internships and received fewer than 15 callbacks — one of which turned into a role at Walmart. I learned that Big Tech isn't the only route to take for a successful tech career.\n\nWhile I struggled to gain traction with tech giants, I eventually secured interviews with several startups and midsize companies.\n\nOne of the internships I applied to early on — without a referral — was a software engineering role at Walmart. A couple of months later, around October 2021, a recruiter reached out about an online assessment followed by two technical interviews. I received an offer soon after the interviews and started the internship in May.\n\nI treated the internship like an extended interview — I asked for weekly feedback, stayed vocal during meetings, and found a mentor. I believe that approach helped me secure a full-time software engineering role with Walmart, which I started in June 2023.\n\nWhen I joined Walmart full-time, the company was in the midst of a major transformation — evolving from a traditional retail giant into a tech-driven, AI-powered organization. It felt like an opportunity to contribute to meaningful technological change while accelerating my own learning. That was a significant reason I decided to stay after my internship.\n\nI'm very happy with my decision. In addition to growing as a software engineer, I've found that the work culture and work-life balance at Walmart are really great. My hours can vary, but I generally work from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and have time to spend with family and friends on the weekends.\n\nI live in Milpitas, California, about a 25-minute commute from Walmart's Sunnyvale office. I'm required to go in two days a week, though in-office expectations vary across teams. The office itself is great. It has a lot of amenities, including boxing and pilates classes, a basketball court, a large gym, and good food.\n\nWalmart offers a wide range of cuisine options in its cafeteria. For lunch, I usually opt for the \"make your own salad bowl,\" but there are also options featuring Asian, Indian, Italian, and Mexican dishes. The food isn't free, but it's subsidized, so it's not costly — and drinks like fountain beverages, tea, and coffee are complimentary.\n\nAt a traditional Big Tech company, you may find early exposure to systems operating at a massive global scale — along with access to specialized internal tooling, research teams, and long-established engineering playbooks. There's also the brand recognition, which could make future job mobility feel more straightforward.\n\nThat said, those differences haven't felt like gaps for me. I haven't felt that I'm missing out on meaningful learning or career development where I am. For me, the quality of work, mentorship, and ownership has mattered more than the logo.\n\nMy advice to other young tech professionals is this: aiming for Big Tech is completely valid — those roles can be great aspirations. However, not landing one of these roles shouldn't be too discouraging. High-impact work can be found in many environments, including startups and emerging tech companies. I also believe that strong compensation is possible outside traditional Big Tech — my compensation is in the six figures.\n\nFrom a job security perspective, I believe the entire tech industry has undergone a period of recalibration over the past couple of years. Layoffs have affected companies of all sizes — including Big Tech, midsize firms, and even large enterprises like Walmart. So I try not to view job security as something tied to a single company or sector.\n\nWhat gives me confidence is focusing on the factors I can control: continuously building relevant skills, staying adaptable, and making a meaningful impact in my role. In short, my advice would be not to limit yourself to a narrow set of companies. Stay open to opportunities where you can learn, contribute, and grow — because the tech world is much bigger than just one path.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Ryan Edwards, 40, the founder of Audoo, who is based in London. His employment and Audoo's investors have been verified by Business Insider. This piece has been edited for length and clarity\n\nIn my early 20s, I was the drummer of an indie band. We toured festivals and made the UK's Top 10 Independent Singles Chart.\n\nBut I knew our success wouldn't last forever. Eventually, the time would come for me to grow up and find a real job.\n\nSince leaving the band in 2008, my career has been varied. I've worked in retail, at startups, and eventually became a senior leader at Visa Europe. In 2018, I founded Audoo, a startup that aims to help musicians receive royalties, which has investors including Elton John.\n\nMy career pivots have been unexpected and I tend to fall into my line of work, but they have felt natural because my dreams keep changing. While my job titles have changed, one thing hasn't: a belief in getting my head down and doing the hard work. In my experience, nine times out of ten, that's what pays off.\n\nAs a kid, I dreamed of being a footballer — then I got into music. My dad loves Motown and he wanted me to become a saxophonist. I started learning the clarinet and the sax, and then the drums, because I thought it might get me more girls.\n\nI planned to study jazz at music school, but that never happened. Soon after I finished my high-school exams, the band I was the drummer of was signed by an indie label while gigging locally. When I heard the words \"record deal,\" I got goosebumps.\n\nFrom 2006, we were suddenly getting studio time and supporting major acts on tour. Looking back, touring for a year and a half was probably a better life experience than going to university: I became a better musician and learned how to drink.\n\nBand life was fun, but it wasn't always easy. I remember renting budget hotel rooms and flipping a coin to see who would sleep on the floor. Eventually, it became clear that the label would prioritize better-selling and more well-behaved bands.\n\nPanic set in when I left the band. I didn't know what to do with my life, but I knew I needed an income. I got a job as an assistant store manager at a cell phone retailer chain in 2008, where I ended up working for four years in increasingly senior roles.\n\nWorking in retail was an excellent education: you're trading day in, day out. There were similarities to life in the band, where I'd sell T-shirts and stickers after shows. In both lines of work, I managed stock and convinced people to part with their hard-earned cash.\n\nI was made redundant in 2012, and after a stint as a business development manager at an app development business — whose founder I met at a friend's wedding — I was offered a job at Visa Europe as a senior manager in late 2013.\n\nI learned to always be open to exploring new opportunities. You never know where they might take you.\n\nIt was my first job in a corporate environment. Suddenly, I was sitting in a three-piece suit at a quiet desk, worrying it would be stale, but I ended up being given permission to shake things up.\n\nI hadn't planned to leave Visa — the pay was great and I felt comfortable in my job. But in 2016, after three years, I joined a fintech start-up in sales, after two brilliant guys tried to poach me. They knew of me from working on Visa data feeds, and needed contacts in retail.\n\nThe risk of pivoting felt worth it because the idea for the business was amazing.\n\nThen the idea for Audoo hit me. In 2018, I was in a department store in London when one of my band's singles started playing, and my wife joked about the royalties I'd earn. I said they were more likely to buy her a coffee than the designer bag she was eyeing up.\n\nWeeks later, I got my royalty statement. It listed what I'd been paid but offered no data about how those payments were calculated or the flow of how plays become payment. I became fascinated by how the royalties process worked — and realized the system was a mess.\n\nInspired by Amazon's Alexa and Shazam, I wanted to build a technology that would identify the music played in public and ensure artists get paid fairly for it. I built the first prototype for Audoo on my kitchen table with a Raspberry Pi. It worked — it recognized songs —but, looking back, it was embarrassing. We use barely any of that code anymore.\n\nNow, our Audoo Audio Meter uses a plug-in device to track the music played in commercial premises, like stores and bars, and sends the data to royalty-collection organizations.\n\nI incorporated Audoo in August 2018 at the age of 33. We'd just gotten a puppy and my wife was pregnant, so I needed it to work. I used LinkedIn to reach out to industry leaders and set up coffee dates, which quickly confirmed there was demand to build and scale the product.\n\nIn 2020, Björn Ulvaeus of ABBA saw me on TV promoting Audoo and later invested. He put out a statement that exceeded my expectations: \"Audoo is a solution I believe will change the music industry forever,\" he said.\n\nThrough word of mouth, others in the music industry started to hear about the company and invest, including Elton John.\n\nThe team and the mission we're delivering are incredibly rewarding — but I'm always open to new challenges.\n\nWhen I was a drummer in The Lines, I never thought I'd one day be the CEO of a music tech company. I can't say where the future will take me as I've never been one to stick to a particular plan.\n\nWhile some people have lifelong linear goals, I tend to reset mine every two to three years. For me, it's about continually learning something new, never being boxed in, and being adaptable to change.",

    "description": "Besides having screen time limits for their kids, many tech execs also have philosophies around encouraging curiosity and learning in their children.",
    "fullText": "Much is known about how tech execs manage their companies. But how about how those with families manage their children?\n\nEven the uber-wealthy leaders have to contend with everyday parenting questions, like whether to limit screen time and how to divvy up chores\n\nWe looked through past interviews to find some of tech leaders' most interesting pointers when it comes to parenting and setting kids up for success in today's world.\n\nHere's what some of the biggest names in tech have said about their approach to raising children.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman told Jimmy Fallon that ChatGPT has helped him raise his baby. He said he \"cannot imagine\" having figured out how to parent a newborn without the technology. He's asked, for example, why his kid wasn't crawling at a certain age.\n\nAltman has also said that his baby \"will never be smarter than AI,\" but will be \"more capable.\" He told the Senate that he doesn't want his kid to form a best-friend-like bond with an AI bot.\n\nAnd when it comes to cribs, Altman has said he has a clear favorite: Cradlewise. It costs nearly $2,000 and gently bounces the baby to get ahead of any fussing. The crib also includes a built-in baby monitor and music features.\n\nAltman also said he's learned the importance of having a lot of burp rags.\n\nWhen asked in 2024 what kids should be studying today, Zuckerberg told Bloomberg that \"the most important thing is learning how to think critically and learning values when you're young.\"\n\n\"This is somewhat of a hiring philosophy that I have, too,\" he said. \"If people have shown that they can go deep and do one thing really well, then they've probably gained experience in the art of learning something and taking it to an excellent level.\"\n\nHe also said in a 2024 interview that, when taking his then-seven-year-old daughter to a Taylor Swift concert, he told her that being like the superstar wasn't \"available\" to her. A therapist in California who has worked with wealthy parents told Business Insider that encouraging her to instead be herself was the right approach.\n\nIn a 2019 interview on CBS This Morning, the Meta CEO said he and his wife, Priscilla Chan, \"don't give them everything.\"\n\n\"They have chores, they have responsibilities,\" Chan added. \"We also take them to work. Mark and I take both of them to the office to see what we do, how we contribute.\"\n\nThat same year, he told Fox News that he generally doesn't want his kids parked in front of a television or computer \"for a long period of time.\" At the time, he said he let his daughters use video calls to talk with relatives across the country but is stricter about other forms of screen time.\n\nNadella says his own parents \"created an environment where they let me set my own pace and pursue what I wanted,\" and that influenced his approach to raising his own children.\n\n\"It's important to focus on what [our kids] need to thrive,\" he previously told Good Housekeeping.\n\nThe Microsoft CEO and his wife, Anu, also \"both think children should have dogs,\" she told Good Housekeeping.\n\n\"There is a different sense of companionship and responsibility that comes with it — that emotional sense that there is a being waiting for you to come back,\" Anu said.\n\nNadella told Good Housekeeping that he gets reports on what their kids do on their computers. The couple limits how many movies and what kinds of video games and websites their kids can view.\n\nNadella has also said that his experience raising a son with cerebral palsy has taught him the importance of empathy, including at work.\n\nPichai still helps his kids with their homework — with some assistance from Google Lens.\n\n\"We use Google Lens for homework. I don't want to get him in trouble, but the class allows you to do that,\" Pichai previously told Bloomberg. \"But sometimes he asks me for help on math. Sometimes I'm lazy and I pretend as if I'm thinking, but I'm also using Google Lens to kind of figure out the answer.\"\n\nThe Google CEO told The New York Times in 2018 that his son, then 11 years old, didn't have a phone, and that he limited his son's TV use.\n\nMicrosoft cofounder Bill Gates has said he parented his kids following a model developed in the 1970s called the \"Love and Logic\" approach.\n\nThe philosophy focuses on exercising control when it comes to emotions, such as by minimizing some reactions as a parent, like shouting or reprimanding. Gates said his dad believed in the same philosophy, and that \"he was never panicked.\"\n\nGates, who for many years was the world's richest man, has also said he tried to keep his kids from being spoiled.\n\n\"We want to strike a balance where they have the freedom to do anything, but not a lot of money showered on them so they could go out and do nothing,\" he once said.\n\nAs far as screen time limits go, Gates forbade his kids from using phones at the dinner table, and didn't give them phones until they were 14 years old.\n\nIn a 2025 episode of the podcast \"Raj Shamani's Figuring it Out,\" Gates said he was giving his children less than 1% of his total wealth, \"because I decided it wouldn't be a favor to them.\"\n\n\"I want to give them a chance to have their own earnings and success be significant,\" Gates added.\n\nBezos took an unusual approach to raising his four kids at times. He said in 2017 that he let his kids use \"sharp knives\" from the age of 4 and power tools at 7 or 8 years old.\n\nThe Amazon founder attributed this to his then-wife, MacKenzie Scott, who he said would \"much rather have a kid with nine fingers than a resourceless kid.\" Bezos added that this was \"a fantastic attitude about life.\"\n\nReddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian incorporated a fun practice from his upbringing into his approach to parenting.\n\n\"My favorite parenting tip that I inherited from him was his Sunday tradition of making breakfast for our family,\" he said in 2020. \"I love being able to make pancakes with my family when we're all in the same place on a Sunday, and always do my best to put away outside distractions so we can be together.\"\n\nOn a 2025 podcast episode, Ohanian said he \"wholeheartedly\" wanted his then-seven-year-old daughter to use AI every day. He said he's used the technology to enhance her creativity: he had ChatGPT turn some of his childhood pencil sketches into \"full-color illustrations.\" His daughter, Ohanian said, still draws with old-fashioned markers and paper as well.\n\nOhanian told CNBC in 2018 that he and tennis star Serena Williams want their daughter \"to know what it's like to have limits on tech.\"\n\n\"My wife and I both want her to be bored,\" he said. \"I do look forward to playing video games with her when she's older, but it's really important that she gets time to just be with her thoughts and be with her blocks and be with her toys, so we'll be regulating it pretty heavily.\"\n\nSnap CEO Evan Spiegel said in 2018 that he and his wife, supermodel Miranda Kerr, limited their then-seven-year-old's screen time to an hour and a half a week. The rule, he said, was partly influenced by not being allowed to watch television until he was almost a teenager.\n\nHe said that parents should lead by example and work to limit their own screen time as well.\n\nSpiegel told People in 2025 that he's glad his kids are growing up with digital tools, and Kerr said they don't let their 14-year-old have phones or computers in his bedroom past 9:30 pm.",

    "title": "Podcasts face a major test in 2026: Can they make it big on TV screens?",
    "description": "YouTube leads in podcast streaming while Netflix plans to launch 33-plus podcasts in 2026. Can video pods become the new TV?",
    "fullText": "Podcasts are increasingly making the leap to TV — and 2026 will be a significant test of the format's potential in the living room.\n\nYouTube, already the top streaming TV service, has solidified its position as the No. 1 destination for podcasts, too. Forty percent of monthly listeners called it their most-used service, trouncing Spotify (18%) and Apple (11%), according to a June 2025 survey by Sounds Profitable and Signal Hill Insights.\n\nNetflix is now looking to challenge YouTube with a slate of video podcasts set to roll out early this year. The streamer has at least 33 shows already in hand and has struck deals for the likes of Bill Simmons, Charlamagne Tha God's \"The Breakfast Club,\" and several Barstool Sports offerings. Netflix has told potential partners it wants to have 50 to 75 shows at launch.\n\nFox also made a significant investment in 2025 in podcasts. It acquired Red Seat Ventures, which handles production and ad sales for conservative hosts including Tucker Carlson, Megyn Kelly, and Bill O'Reilly. It also signed a deal that brings \"Crime Junkie\" parent Audiochuck's shows to its free streamer, Tubi.\n\nAll this is encouraging to podcast insiders who love the prospect of seeing some competition for YouTube and more money flowing into the space. YouTube's ascent spurred many audio hosts to create video versions of their shows and also drew more influencers to the format.\n\n\"We're essentially an influencer medium,\" Greg Glenday, the CEO of leading podcast company Acast, told Business Insider. Acast has been looking to position its hosts as creators to broaden their appeal to advertisers.\n\nResearch shows that the definition of a podcast has expanded. A quarter of people polled by the Sounds Profitable survey said they thought of podcasts as either audio or video, up from 21% in 2024.\n\n\"What began as an audio-only medium has become a visual-first content format, essentially the modern-day counterpart to certain types of television programming that can also live in audio,\" Michael Calvin Jones, SVP of Wasserman Creators, recently told Business Insider.\n\nHowever, it remains to be seen how successfully podcasts can make the transition to TV. Will they truly become the next generation's version of a TV talk show? Some industry insiders think the potential for podcasts, which often consist of one or two people talking in a studio, to become a premium visual offering could be overstated.\n\nEven YouTube's rise could be, in some respects, misleading. Sounds Profitable's survey found that a lot of people still use YouTube to listen to podcasts as well as watch them.\n\n\"The numbers are saying more and more are watching podcasts on YouTube, but it doesn't mean they're actually watching them,\" said Adam McNeil, a podcast ad buyer at Adopter Media. \"YouTube is important for discoverability, but is it still very much an audio-based medium? I would say it is.\"\n\nWhether video podcasts can grow the podcast listening pie, or, in the case of Netflix, juice engagement or subscribers, is also still TBD. In the case of Bill Simmons, Netflix is presenting his sports talk show live on Sundays starting January 11, giving it a shot at being appointment viewing.\n\n\"They're not an acquisition lever like tentpole originals, breakout viral hits, or live sports,\" said Nick Cicero, founder of measurement company Mondo Metrics. Video podcasts could get people to increase their time and frequency on the service, help retain them as subscribers, and serve niche audiences, he said.\n\nNetflix's approach is also a gamble for the hosts. The streamer is getting hosts to pull their video shows off YouTube in its quest for exclusivity. But top independent creators often want to distribute their shows as widely as possible and value the real-time performance data and fan interactivity they get on YouTube.\n\nPodcasts have largely been a free, widely distributed medium, and being paywalled and exclusive to one platform has been the exception rather than the rule. Spotify tried to sew up top podcaster Joe Rogan and others, but moved away from exclusives after four years to maximize their distribution and ad sales.\n\nBeing on Netflix could expose hosts to a whole new set of viewers, but some industry insiders wonder if taking the shows off YouTube could mean losing fans who aren't motivated enough to seek them out on a new platform.\n\n\"I think it's a huge risk,\" McNeil said.",

    "title": "Inside Saks Fifth Avenue's fight for its life: How a tumultuous 12 months left the retailer on the brink of bankruptcy",
    "description": "Saks is on the brink of bankruptcy after a year of missed payments, vendor pullbacks, and a rescue plan gone awry. Here's how the crisis unfolded.",
    "fullText": "From the outside, Saks Fifth Avenue — the century-old department store in Manhattan — is literally glowing, its façade decorated with thousands of glittering lights as part of its annual holiday display.\n\nThe shine, however, masks a retailer under pressure. On Friday, Saks named a new CEO, capping a tumultuous 12 months for the heavily leveraged department store owner. After months of restructurings, lawsuits, missed payments, and broken promises, Saks Global is now facing the possibility of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nWhat happens next could have consequences for customers. Brands — some of which haven't been paid in full for over a year — have paused shipments to Saks' stores, and creditors are awaiting news of its financial future.\n\nIn early December, Hilldun Corp., which acts as a sort of guarantor or insurer for brands, said it would no longer back shipments to Saks. The firm represents about 140 brands that sell to Saks — in the past, it's worked with big names like Tommy Hilfiger, Marc Jacobs, and A.L.C. — and supplies the retailer with at least $500 million worth of product annually.\n\nHilldun's delay was expected to be short-lived, but shipments were still on hold as 2025 came to a close amid growing reports that Saks Global, which also owns Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus, was considering a court-supervised reorganization.\n\n\"They must do something very quickly to rectify this situation in the market, or they will not have a spring season,\" Gary Wassner, Hilldun's CEO, told Business Insider. \"Every order is on hold until Saks clarifies to the industry what they intend to do.\"\n\nSaks itself hasn't negated the bankruptcy talk.\n\n\"Together with our key financial stakeholders, we are exploring all potential paths to secure a strong and stable future,\" a spokesperson for Saks Global told Business Insider. \"Importantly, opportunities in the luxury market remain strong, and Saks Global continues to play a distinct and enduring role within it.\"\n\nTo succeed, Saks' stores must not only resolve their debt issues, but continue to offer the assortment of luxury clothing, shoes, handbags, and beauty products that have long made its stores shopping paradises.\n\nAs things stand today, that's at risk, Mark Cohen, the former CEO of Sears Canada, told Business Insider. \"They aren't going to have goods on the shelf, certainly not new goods. This is a house of cards — from a financial point of view, from a merchandising point of view, from a customer profile point of view.\"\n\n2025 was supposed to be a great year for Saks.\n\nFor more than a decade, the retailer, with its large physical footprint, had struggled to maintain its dominance as shopping patterns shifted, with customers turning to e-commerce or brand-owned outlets. It wasn't alone: Nordstrom was treading water before it was taken private, and Macy's has endured a drawn-out turnaround plan.\n\nIts problems intensified following the pandemic, when inflation and economic uncertainty curbed discretionary spending. By 2023, it began to face challenges in paying vendors.\n\nThen, at the end of 2024, Saks finalized its $2.7 billion acquisition of Neiman Marcus Group, forming a luxury behemoth backed by the technology of Salesforce and Amazon, which took stakes in the new company as part of the deal. The move was seen as a solution to the beleaguered retailer's problems.\n\n\"It was touch-and-go up until the Neiman Marcus deal occurred,\" Wassner said. \"Everyone thought that would solve the cash flow problems.\"\n\nThe deal was financed by $2.2 billion worth of junk bonds — debt that carries high interest rates — which S&P Global called \"unsustainable.\" It left the company strapped for cash, leading to a round of layoffs to start the year (multiple more would follow).\n\nOne of the first red flags for Saks arose on Valentine's Day, when vendors, who Wassner estimates are owed hundreds of millions, received an I-love-you-not from then-Saks Global CEO Marc Metrick.\n\nHe told them that they'd have to wait. Saks would pay its overdue bills — in some cases, more than a year past due — in installments stretched over 12 months that wouldn't begin until summer.\n\nVendors, some of whom were burned by similar communications prior to the 2019 bankruptcy of the iconic department store Barney's, were left between a rock and a hard place.\n\nOne vendor, who said he is owed six figures, called the situation \"agony.\"\n\n\"We thought it was going to be a smoother transition and that this was going to be a global luxury masterpiece in the making,\" the person said. \"That just did not happen.\"\n\nBrands could withhold inventory shipments — which would risk ruining relationships with a core customer and put more strain on Saks' balance sheet — or continue business as usual and hope for the best.\n\nThose who chose the latter were further disappointed in July, when the payment schedule wasn't met.\n\nThat month, Saks' financial vulnerability was made clear when a nine-figure interest payment prompted a debt restructuring. A majority of bondholders agreed to provide cash in return for being moved up on the retailer's cap table. Basically, meaning that if (or when) Saks files for bankruptcy, those bondholders get first dibs — likely before any vendors.\n\n\"I will say the biggest part of it has been the mental cruelty of this situation, waking up, not knowing what's going to happen, trying to keep things going,\" the vendor who spoke to Business Insider said.\n\nIn the fall, things had dissolved to the point that several labels were withholding inventory.\n\nS&P analysts wrote that Saks had a \"less-than-adequate in-stock inventory position.\" In October, the company lowered its earnings guidance for the year, blaming inventory challenges.\n\n\"You are going to ship to somebody you know you're going to get paid from,\" Tim Hynes, the global head of credit research at Debtwire, told Business Insider. \"You will give Saks what's left, you're not going to give them the best.\"\n\nSome brands went even further, taking direct aim at Saks.\n\nSkincare brand Sunday Riley said it threatened to sue if payments were not made, Retail Dive reported in August.\n\nIn October, Jovani Fashion, the dressmaker made famous by \"Real Housewives of New York\" star Luann de Lesseps, filed a lawsuit against Saks Global — a rare step in a relationship-driven industry. Jovani said Saks owed $295,651 for merchandise it accepted this year. (Saks has denied wrongdoing.)\n\n\"It's time to solve the problems one way or another,\" Wassner said.\n\nBankruptcy isn't the only option. The company has billions of dollars in real estate that it can sell — it recently sold the land beneath its Beverly Hills location — and can close down unproductive stores, as it did with several Saks Off 5th locations and has floated doing with the Neiman Marcus in Dallas. The retailer's store names still hold cultural cache, and deep-pocketed investors could step in to enhance the shopping experience.\n\nCohen, the former Sears exec, doesn't expect Saks to close Bergdorf's or that famous Fifth Avenue location anytime soon, but there's still a long road ahead.\n\n\"They're not getting merchandise freely. They've had enormous upheaval in management. The luxury business, generally speaking, is not robust at the moment, and we're going into a year, 2026, which has all the makings of an honest-to- god recession,\" he said. \"Is there sunshine here? I don't think so.\"\n\nKaja Whitehouse contributed reporting to this article.",

    "description": "From AI to workplace changes to side hustles, Business Insider is diving in on the topics you care about.",
    "fullText": "It's a new year! And at Business Insider, we're already diving in.\n\nWe've always been the place for innovators, and AI's arrival is creating a renaissance for entrepreneurs of all stripes. It's led to whole new industries — from legal AI to chatbot training to vibe coding to the data center boom. Everyone is learning as they go, and we are here to help you generate ideas, trade notes, and get smarter. We'll chronicle highs and lows — there will for sure be both.\n\nAt larger firms, leaders will be sizing up which AI experiments are working, at what costs, and with what benefits. How fast AI helps companies' bottom lines will determine whether we're in bubble times in the markets. We're all over that in our new First Trade newsletter.\n\nAI is a big story line on Wall Street, but it's not the only one. This past year showed dents in basic assumptions about capitalism in the US — principles that have underscored the \"stocks for the long run\" thinking that has proven sound for investors. International markets are getting more of a look, especially with rearmament in Europe and AI as a global tailwind.\n\nBetween Washington's investments in business, Zohran Mamdani's rise in the nation's financial capital, and surveys showing eroding confidence in capitalism, that mindset is no longer the given it once was. We are launching a series this week, \"The Future of Capitalism,\" and what it means for your work and wealth. Take our survey, and watch Monday for our first piece!\n\nMeanwhile, in workplaces, capitalism is alive and well. The \"anti-woke workplace\" is increasingly in fashion, and we will help you navigate an era in which many managers, in a sharp shift, are more focused on employee performance than employee policies.\n\nOur obsession with side hustles is still a full-time job for us, whether your thing is real estate, brand influencing, Uber driving, or renting your clothing. And as our reporting showed this past year, a strong side hustle can not only be fun, but also crucial if white-collar layoffs snag you.\n\nSpeaking about clothing, you've made clear you care about how to show up to succeed at work. We're exploring the cost of that, and whether that cost is sometimes too high — for your wallet or your heart. We've also got you covered on style and status, from show-off golf shirts and luxury handbags to viral hoodies, coveted watches, and Wall Street's favorite $1,100 shoes.\n\nAll of which is to say, we're pumped to cover all that's ahead — in words, video, audio, newsletters, online and IRL events, and every way that works for you! As always, please stay in touch! Email me at eic@businessinsider.com.\n\nThe BI Today team: Jamie Heller, editor in chief, in New York. Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

    "description": "Apple needs big news in 2026, and it's expected to deliver launches like a foldable iPhone.",
    "fullText": "Apple is famously tight-lipped about what it's working on. However, occasionally the tech giant gives hints about what's coming.\n\nIt's pointed to big changes coming to its voice assistant Siri, for example.\n\n2026 is shaping up to be a pivotal year for Apple, which is expected to release a foldable iPhone and upgrade its AI, Apple Intelligence, a technology that CEO Tim Cook has struggled to establish as a household name.\n\n\"Many will point to AI as Cook's Achilles' heel — and that critique is not misplaced, though not for lack of early ambition. The shortfall lies in execution,\" Forrester analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee told Business Insider.\n\nThe company typically makes big product announcements in June at its Worldwide Developers Conference and in the fall, when it tends to debut a new iPhone generation. It also sprinkles in other product launches throughout the year, such as new iPads or Mac computers.\n\nHere's what tech analysts, insiders, and Apple itself have said to expect from the tech giant in 2026.\n\nApple did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nApple's Services business, which encompasses its subscription-based offerings, has experienced steady growth across several earnings periods. It makes sense that this is an area where Apple would want to continue innovating.\n\nOn January 2, the tech giant released an update to its Apple Fitness+ service, which it teased heading into the new year.\n\nThe features include new workout programs, an Artist Spotlight that features exercise playlists dedicated to specific artists, and new additions to its Time to Walk program, which pairs storytelling with music for people to listen to while walking.\n\nApple first teased an updated AI-powered Siri at WWDC 2024 in a now-deleted clip where actor Bella Ramsey asks Siri to remind them about the name of someone they'd had dinner with in the past. In the clip, Siri was able to recall the name based on the prior context of texts and the calendar.\n\nWhen Apple Intelligence came out in fall 2024, that version of Siri was missing. In March 2025, Apple made the rare move of delaying its launch, saying it'll be released \"in the coming year.\"\n\nApple confirmed to Tom's Guide in June 2025 that the new Siri would come in 2026.\n\nApple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of TF International Securities, known for his Apple predictions and supply-chain sourcing, said in a note in 2025 that he expects Apple to introduce the first foldable iPhone in 2026 with a retail price of over $2,000.\n\nBloomberg's Mark Gurman reported a similar timeline and price point for the launch of a foldable iPhone.\n\nCompetitors like Samsung and Chinese phone maker Huawei have been on the foldable phones trend for years, so Apple won't be the first to innovate its product lineup this way.\n\nAs it stands, foldable phones have a relatively \"small base\" in the smartphone market, Chatterjee told Business Insider in August 2025. Apple, however, has the market share to make the form factor mainstream among smartphone owners.\n\n\"Apple will, like it has done before in the smartwatch business, where Samsung moved first, be a catalyst for growth in the category,\" Chatterjee said.\n\nApple analyst Kuo published a note in June 2025 on a more affordable 13-inch MacBook, which Bloomberg reported could cost less than the $999 MacBook Air, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nIt would be the first MacBook to run on a chip built for an iPhone, Kuo said. Kuo predicted mass production would begin in the fourth quarter of 2025 or early 2026.",

    "title": "After getting laid off from a corporate job, I started bartending — and it changed my approach to office work",
    "description": "Marketing veteran Julie Levin briefly turned to bartending after being laid off. The experience changed her approach to corporate work.",
    "fullText": "After getting laid off in 2023, marketing veteran Julie Levin worked part time as a bartender for about six months as she considered her next steps. Levin is now the head of brand partnerships at Two Things, a New York City consultancy specializing in business transformations. The following has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nI moved across the country from LA to the New York area in 2022 for a really exciting job that I thought would mark the next phase of my career. But in 2023, there was a lot going on in the marketing industry, and I was laid off.\n\nIt was a setback I hadn't anticipated. It really called into question what was next for me. It's a scary place to be.\n\nI started doing some consulting, but I also wanted to be thoughtful and take time to calibrate. That's why I added bartending, which I'd done in college, into the mix. I thought it would be a way to have fun during a stressful time and make some extra money. It taught more lessons than I bargained for, in the best of ways.\n\nI had bartended at this place during the summer in college, when it was a dive. It's now fine dining with proper mixology. That meant it wasn't pouring beers and shots and easy high-balls. It was complex drinks. Not only did we have to follow the recipe for them at a high volume, but we were expected to create drinks.\n\nThere's nothing more humbling than getting behind the bar, because my corporate success wasn't relevant. The idea of not hiding behind a title was illuminating.\n\nI've always had a good work ethic, but bartending is next level. It's not just physical. There is an emotional element to it. Being behind that bar, engaging with people, and stripping away any artifice and pretense — it's a really cool thing.\n\nThere is this expectation, when you hear about people who bartend at a place like that, that you're going to walk out with 1,500 bucks every time. That's not true. It's really hard in the service industry. Bartending also shows you how good you have it in the corporate world.\n\nWhen I was bartending, there was an \"aha\" moment, and it was completely attitudinal. It's about getting more flies with honey. I think I was a late-bloomer in this sense — it didn't really dawn on me until I was behind the bar.\n\nThere were people who were full-time bartenders. When they were in a bad mood, they brought it with them. Meanwhile, you're this customer paying $20-plus a cocktail, just looking to have a nice time. You've got this surly bartender who acts like they're doing you a favor.\n\nInitially, I wanted to be part of things, and I'd complain alongside them. Then I was like, \"Wait a second. This is ridiculous. Put a smile on your face.\"\n\nIt's not that easy to stand there for eight hours and sling complicated drinks. But be pleasant; be happy — that's not that heavy of a lift. The second I did that, everything changed. It actually became the fun experience I thought it would be.\n\nAll of a sudden, I set this new tone, and it was transformational. That is something I try to carry with me. Bring a good attitude, even if you don't feel like you want to, and the circumstances suck, and your manager is the worst.\n\nPeople would be like, \"You're such a good bartender.\" The truth is, I wasn't that great. I was serviceable. Maybe, in time, I could have become amazing. But the attitude shift was infectious, and it made a huge difference.\n\nAfter bartending, I brought that spirit back to my team, and I got shout-outs all the time — not for the work I did, which I thought was pretty significant.\n\nThe praise largely came because I brought a positive attitude and a cheery spirit. No one would have said that about me for the first 20 years of my career. They would have said, \"She's really capable, really smart, but sometimes demanding and intense.\"\n\nPeople who lack the ability to roll up their sleeves and get in the weeds and also be nice to people — regardless of their title, or if they can do something for them — are going to have a really hard time.\n\nBartending forced me to rethink everything and see things that I wouldn't have seen, and enjoy every step of it, challenging and otherwise.\n\nIt teaches you the resilience and problem-solving capabilities to challenge yourself and be fearless. If you don't have those skill sets today, it's going to be hard for you to be successful.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career? Contact this reporter at tparadis@businessinsider.com.",

    "title": "Trump hinted at US troops guarding Venezuela's oil. Putting boots on the ground comes with high risks.",
    "description": "The US military has experience guarding oil infrastructure, but deploying troops to Venezuela comes with high risks in a dangerous environment.",
    "fullText": "On the heels of a high-stakes mission inside Venezuela's capital that captured its indicted leader to bring him to justice, President Donald Trump said his goal now was to get major US oil companies access to its huge reserves — even if it means deploying US troops.\n\n\"We're going to have a presence in Venezuela as it pertains to oil,\" Trump said in a Saturday press conference at Mar-a-Lago in reply to a question about whether the US military would have a presence there. \"So you may need something, not very much.\"\n\nVenezuela has one of the world's largest proven oil reserves, but deploying US troops to guard its oilfields and aging infrastructure comes with high risks and costs, military experts told Business Insider, and will require a stable security environment. This kind of operation may also require congressional authorization or additional funding.\n\n\"When you put US troops into a foreign country, there is going to be some resistance unless they are invited,\" said Peter Mansoor, a retired US Army colonel and professor of military history at the Ohio State University who is an expert in counterinsurgency warfare.\n\nMansoor, who commanded a brigade in Iraq, said US operations there are instructive, showing why sending US troops into Venezuela is the \"least desirable\" option. Iraqis themselves guarded their energy infrastructure, he said, which proved quite vulnerable to attack during the insurgency: Pipelines were bombed, mortars struck an oil refinery, trucks were hijacked only to have the oil sold on black markets.\n\n\"All of those things happened in Iraq, and they could happen here too if the Venezuelans allow an insurgency to erupt,\" said Mansoor, who is also a senior fellow at the Mershon Center for International Security Studies at OSU.\n\nMuch of Venezuela's operations are now managed by the state-run PDVSA oil company that took on assets that had belonged to US companies. Of US oil majors, only Chevron remains.\n\nVenezuela's future production is as murky as its tar-like extra-heavy crude. This type of oil is a large part of its massive oil reserves and requires a crude upgrader process to make it easier to move, an industry analyst said.\n\n\"All of that requires a lot of upfront investment,\" said Ben Cahill, an energy analyst at the University of Texas at Austin. \"So the Venezuelan oil sector presents some particular challenges. The reserves are enormous, and under the right political transition, and if a different investment regime returns, it is an opportunity that will be attractive to some companies.\"\n\nTo be sure, the US military has plenty of experience with energy infrastructure. Soldiers have patrolled near oil fields in eastern Syria. Warships and cutters guarded oil platforms off Iraq during the war and intercepted oil smugglers. A US task force more recently escorted ships, including tankers, threatened by missile and drone attacks in the Red Sea.\n\nAny US military mission in Venezuela turns on a turbulent situation where it's unclear who's in charge; Trump said at the press conference that US officials would be \"running\" Venezuela for a time.\n\n\"What's unclear here is who is actually the opponent,\" said Bryan Clark, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute. \"Do we think we're going to have to send troops to go in and seize these oil fields rather than simply having the government of Venezuela change its model for managing them? At this point, it's unclear what exactly the protection is from and who would be doing it.\"\n\n\"So jumping ahead to say that the US military is going to now be protecting a bunch of oil facilities is premature,\" Clark said.\n\nOne thing that makes this national discussion so unusual is that it's so nakedly about oil access, unlike the stated justifications for the Persian Gulf war or the 2003 Iraq invasion.\n\n\"The Trump administration has been very open about oil, even though they've tried to position this a little bit in terms of human rights,\" said Paul Poast, an associate professor of political science at the University of Chicago and a resident fellow at the Chicago Council of Global Affairs. \"What remains to be seen is how much planning went into the aftermath — which of course the US has a terrible track record with.\"",

    "title": "CEO of $90 billion Waste Management hauled trash and went to 1 a.m. safety briefings—‘It’s not always just dollars and cents’",
    "description": "Jim Fish took his father-in-law’s advice and attended early-morning safety meetings to meet with workers, ride in truck cabs, and talk about whatever was on their minds.",
    "fullText": "For a night owl like Waste Management CEO Jim Fish, waking up for 1 a.m. safety briefings could make for a brutally long day. But Fish did it because his late father-in-law, a union pipefitter, told him if he showed up to those meetings—not just once, but regularly—he would learn a lot and build a rapport with line workers.\n\nFish’s father-in-law hit the nail on the head.\n\n“It was so valuable to me in terms of learning the business and learning the people,” Fish told Fortune. “Part of what I learned—I was always a finance guy—was that it’s not always just dollars and cents.”\n\nWaste Management has named safety as a cornerstone of the company’s operations and has set a goal to reduce its total recordable injury rate (TRIR) by 3% annually with a TRIR target of 2.0 by 2030. If the company hits the target, that means workers would have suffered two recordable injuries per 100 employees per year or per 200,000 hours worked. Last year, the company reduced overall injuries by 5.8%, according to its sustainability report, and lost-time injuries by 2.4%.\n\n“You make investments in safety or investments in people and they don’t necessarily show up on the bottom line—at least not immediately,” Fish said. “Safety tends to show up in longer terms, and if you do have a safe organization, that will eventually show up on your income statement—but it takes a while.”\n\nWaste Management, with $22 billion in revenue in 2024, is the U.S. and Canada’s largest provider of trash and recycling transfer and disposal services. With a market cap of about $90 billion, the Houston, Tex.-based company counts more than 60,000 employees. Fish, 63, has served as president and CEO since November 2016 but has been with the company for two decades. Prior to taking the top job, Fish held roles including chief financial officer, senior vice president of the eastern group, and area VP for Pennsylvania and West Virginia.\n\nUp until halfway through his time as CFO, Fish would go out about every four to six weeks and haul trash with crews—generally about every time he went to a middle-of-the-night safety meeting. Eventually, the board told him they weren’t crazy about the idea of him throwing trash, but he could still ride along in the trucks with workers. Now, Fish said he visits about 20 to 30 sites a year, and takes about five to 10 trips to ride along with drivers. He tells them any subject is fair game, including sports, politics, safety, or pay, but they have to make sure to chat because Fish might fall asleep otherwise.\n\n“Most drivers are a little nervous when I get in the cab but after about 10 minutes they kind of loosen up and tell me what they’re thinking,” said Fish.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump says Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is a traitor.  “Every thought that we had in our minds, she seemed to be very good at verbalizing,” Harling said.  Saying things that no one else would say may be Greene’s most durable legacy as she steps down on Monday, resigning halfway through her third term in Congress.",
    "fullText": "DALTON, Ga. (AP) — President Donald Trump says Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is a traitor. But for Jackie Harling, who chairs the local Republican Party in Greene’s northwestern corner of Georgia, she’s still “mama bear.”\n\n“Every thought that we had in our minds, she seemed to be very good at verbalizing,” Harling said.\n\nSaying things that no one else would say may be Greene’s most durable legacy as she steps down on Monday, resigning halfway through her third term in Congress. First, it was her embrace of conspiracy theories and incendiary rhetoric, turning her into a national symbol of a political culture without guardrails. Then it was her willingness to criticize Trump, a schism that made her position in Washington untenable.\n\nIn interviews in Greene’s district, constituents described her over and over as a “fighter.” For Republicans like Harling, that was enough.\n\n“We got a lot of satisfaction,” Harling said. “She was our voice.”\n\nIt was less satisfying for an independent like Heath Patterson, who struggled to think of ways that Greene's fame and notoriety made a difference for her district during her time in the U.S. Capitol.\n\n“I don’t know of anything that she did do here except, certainly, got her voice heard. But where did we, how did we benefit from that?” he said. “I don’t think we did.”\n\nGreene began clashing with Trump last year, criticizing his focus on foreign policy and his reluctance to release documents involving the Jeffrey Epstein case. The president eventually had enough, saying he would support a primary challenge against her. Greene announced a week later that she would resign.\n\nShe has kept up the criticism since then, including over Trump's decision to strike Venezuela this weekend.\n\n“This is what many in MAGA thought they voted to end,” Greene wrote on social media on Saturday. “Boy were we wrong.”\n\nThe split was surprising because, until that point, Greene’s trajectory had mirrored Trump’s own rise to power. She didn’t become politically involved until his presidential campaign in 2016 and first ran for Congress in 2020. Greene considered trying to represent Georgia’s 6th congressional district, which includes the Atlanta suburbs, before relocating to the 14th, where the Republican incumbent was retiring.\n\nShe remained loyal to Trump after he lost to President Joe Biden, promoting his falsehoods about a stolen election. When Trump ran again in 2024, she toured the country with him and spoke at his rallies while wearing a red “Make America Great Again” hat.\n\nHer Georgia district is one of the most Republican-leaning in the state, although it wasn’t always that way. The region once backed Democrats like Zell Miller, a governor and U.S. senator who spearheaded Georgia’s lottery program that still bankrolls college scholarships and early childhood education programs.\n\nBut residents have felt left behind by years of change, said Jan Pourquoi, a Belgian native who emigrated in 1987, became a U.S. citizen and later won local office in Whitfield County.\n\nHis county’s population has grown by roughly by 32% since 1990, which pales in comparison to statewide growth of 74%. As the U.S. becomes more urban, secular, and diverse, Pourquoi said residents believe they’re “culturally oppressed.”\n\n“They see themselves as great Americans, proud Americans, Christian Americans, and that doesn’t fit the American model anymore as they see it,” said Pourquoi, who said he left the Republican Party because of Trump. Greene exemplified the political backlash, which he summarized as “stick it to them — any possible way you can.”\n\nGeorgia leaders, like those in many other states, have spent years drawing congressional districts to pack like-minded voters together. That means in red areas, whoever wins the Republican primary is virtually guaranteed to come out on top in the general election, incentivizing candidates like Greene with more hardline views.\n\nThe political landscape means former Republicans like Pourquoi or independents like Patterson say they have no shot at helping a centrist win.\n\n“I’m kind of square in the middle,” said Patterson, adding that it sometimes feels like he’s “the only one around here who’s that way.”\n\nRepublicans plan their path forward\n\nWhitfield County Republicans gathered at a local restaurant last month for their annual Christmas party, where seasonal decor and a visit from Santa Claus were intermingled with the red, white and blue regalia and a smattering of MAGA paraphernalia.\n\nThere was still deep affection for Greene and plenty of talk about the cultural issues she championed.\n\n“I think it’s just the fact that she was unwavering in ‘America First,’” said Gavin Swafford, who worked on Greene’s initial campaign.\n\nSwafford called her “an accountability representative” because of her clashes with Republican leaders.\n\nLisa Adams, a party volunteer, called Greene “our stand-up person.”\n\n“Look at her stance on transgenderism. That’s a big one,” she said. “Abortion. That’s a big one.”\n\nNone of Greene's inconsistencies — real or perceived — were a problem, they said.\n\nFor example, Greene has praised the Korean-owned solar panel factories in the district even after voting against Biden-era policies intended to boost production. She broke with Republicans, Trump included, and sided with Democrats who wanted to extend premium subsidies for Affordable Care Act health insurance customers.\n\nNone of the Republicans at the Christmas party expressed any interest in taking sides between Trump and Greene.\n\n“I think it’s inevitable when you have two firebrands that are both stubborn,” Swafford said.\n\nAsked whether the district missed having a more traditional lawmaker, the kind who might cut bipartisan deals and bring as much federal money as possible back home, Swafford was unconcerned.\n\n“The biggest thing that Marjorie contributed wasn’t even in legislation,\" he said.\n\nStill, there was also a sense among some that Greene, for all her bare-knuckle politics, could have gone further.\n\nStar Black, a Republican who is running to replace Greene, was already planning a primary challenge before she announced her resignation.\n\n“You had a great representative who was a fighter. Well, you know what? I want to take it one step further,” Black said.\n\n“Not only do you need a fighter,” Black said, “you need someone who is going to listen. You need someone who is going to represent you.”",

    "fullText": "CORTE MADERA, Calif. (AP) — Heavy rain and high tides believed to be the most severe in two decades caused flooding in parts of Northern California on Saturday, prompting road closures and rescues of people trapped in cars.\n\nRoadways through a 15-mile (24-kilometer) stretch from the Sausalito area to San Rafael were flooded after a downpour coincided with record-breaking “ King Tides,” Marin County Sheriff's Sgt. Michael Dobbins said.\n\nAuthorities were called to assist when cars got stuck in water as high as 3 and 4 feet (1.1 and 1.2 meters), Dobbins said.\n\n“There is a lot of water in the roadways,” Dobbins said, adding that the tides were reportedly the highest in more than two decades. “Along with heavy rains, it just created the perfect storm for flooding on the streets.”\n\nAuthorities in the affected communities, which are north of San Francisco, asked people to stay home until waters recede. Some people kayaked along swamped streets, while others waded through water above their knees.\n\nA flood warning was in place for the San Francisco area until 2 p.m. Saturday and an advisory until 2 p.m. Sunday, according to the National Weather Service, and repeated rounds of rain were expected throughout the state on Sunday and Monday.\n\nTo the south in Santa Barbara County, roads were closed due to flooding and a key highway was blocked near Goleta due to a series of mudslides. A man died after he was swept into a creek during the storm, the county sheriff’s office said.\n\nKing Tides occur when the sun, moon and Earth are in alignment and the moon is in its closest position to the Earth, creating a stronger gravitational pull.",

    "title": "Woman Says She Felt ‘Pretty Good’ After Surgery to Remove Cancerous Mole on Her Face — Until She Took Bandage Off (Exclusive)",
    "description": "Daniela Mullins first noticed the small mole on her face in 2015, but hadn't realized how much it had changed over the years",
    "fullText": "Daniela Mullins went in for a full-body scan while she and her dermatologist were figuring out her postpartum skin\n\nWhen her dermatologist saw the mole on her face, they decided to get a closer look\n\nMullins was later diagnosed with Stage 0 skin cancer, also known as carcinoma in situ\n\nDaniela Mullins was having skin issues after giving birth to her daughter and decided to go see a new dermatologist for a regular check-in.\n\nWhen she went in for a full-body scan in April 2025, her dermatologist took note of the mole on her face, which Mullins tells PEOPLE she first noticed around June 2015.\n\nTo the naked eye, Mullins, 34, says the mole looked \"normal,\" but her doctor felt differently.\n\n\"I didn't notice my mole changing at all. It wasn't until this whole diagnosis, everything happened, that I went back and looked at pictures and realized how much it had changed,\" the Virginia resident shares with PEOPLE.\n\nBecause Mullins was recently postpartum, her dermatologist decided to wait six months before doing a biopsy.\n\nOn Oct. 24, 2025, Mullins finally went in for the medical procedure, and one week later, she learned she had melanoma. She was diagnosed with Stage 0 skin cancer, or carcinoma in situ, meaning that the cancer was on top of her skin and hadn't spread yet.\n\nJust before Thanksgiving, she had surgery to remove the mole and the surrounding area.\n\n\"If it wasn't for that skin check I had scheduled, I don't know when I would've realized that I had melanoma on my face,\" she shares, noting that she had seen multiple dermatologists in the past and no one had ever raised concerns about the mole.\n\nAfter the surgery, Mullins shares that she was feeling \"pretty good\" — until she took her bandages off.\n\n\"Two days after I took off my bandage from the procedure, that's when it hit me,\" she says. \"Before then, it was just a diagnosis on paper, and even during the procedure, I wasn't worried, scared or anything.\"\n\n\"Once I saw the impact on my face, it hit me, and not because of aesthetics. It just became reality. It was a tangible thing,\" Mullins shares.\n\nWhile the mole was just a small dot on her face, the incision stretched nearly her entire cheek, since doctors often remove the area around the lesion in hopes of eliminating as much potential cancer as possible.\n\nHer scar will take a full year to heal, but in the meantime, her doctor recommended \"time, patience, and Vaseline.\"\n\n\"He said, 'Just give it time. Just let your body do what it needs to do,'\" she shares.\n\nHowever, Mullins emphasizes that she's less concerned about the scar and more focused on her health.\n\n\"My number one importance was just getting this cancer out of me and moving forward,\" she tells PEOPLE. \"It's important to note that some people do care about that, and that's okay; that's valid, too. I don't want my experience and 'ugly scar' to scare people away from getting skin checks.\"\n\nMoving forward, she will get full-body scans every four months, something she will likely have to stay on top of for the rest of her life.\n\n\"Because this popped up, I have a higher chance of developing another one now. Thankfully, because it was caught at Stage 0, I don't need further treatment. So it's not like I need chemo,\" she says. \"Now it's taking care of my scar right now, making sure it stays hydrated and making sure that the rest of my body... trying to notice any changes I might have in moles and being more aware of my skin.\"\n\nMullins \"randomly\" decided to share her health journey on TikTok, which \"took off and resonated with people.\" She has since become an advocate for regular skin checks.\n\n\"I continued sharing my journey, especially after I learned that I could get skin cancer. I'm Latina, and my parents are both from Peru. I didn't think that this would ever be a cancer I could get,\" she admits. \"I wasn't taught that that was something I could get. I thought it was really eye-opening and important for other people to know this.\"\n\nAlthough some users were shocked by the size of Mullins' scar, others reminded her that the \"scar is a lifeline\" and that they'd \"rather have a scar than cancer.\"\n\nAs for anyone who might find themselves in a similar position, Mullins says to \"take it one step at a time.\"\n\n\"Go with what your doctor is saying, because it's easy to Google, [go] on TikTok, and spiral, but just go with the advice of your doctor and take it one step at a time,\" she tells PEOPLE. \"It is a lot to process, and this isn't anything to be ashamed or afraid of alone.\"\n\n\"If you have a support system, really, really lean on it, because I don't think I would've been able to muster the strength without it,\" Mullins adds.\n\nHer diagnosis has motivated her to focus on her health in 2026 and beyond.\n\n\"Ever since this diagnosis, now I'm like, okay, I need to get my other things checked that I've been neglecting, because when you're a mom, you just put yourself last. It's easy to fall behind on things, but I've scheduled everything I need to schedule, and I'm getting everything checked out, a little bit at a time,\" she says.\n\n\"I'm trying to be more preventative than having to face the consequences of putting stuff off.\"",

    "fullText": "Luke Littler has conquered the world of darts. Again.\n\nIf last year was Littler proving he could do it, this year was the 18-year-old showing he could not be stopped.\n\nIt was domination from first to last. Just four sets dropped across the entire tournament, with any perceived blips or wobbles not really worthy of the name.\n\nLittler's demolition job on Gian van Veen was his final flourish, his masterpiece at a World Championship in which he made brilliance look effortless.\n\nUnstoppable. That was the word put to him time and again as he sat patiently, Sid Waddell Trophy in tow, at his post-final news conference.\n\nLittler would not bite. \"At times, I am unstoppable\" was as close as he came to accepting it.\n\nWell, with two world titles and a final defeat in three visits to Alexandra Palace, and 10 major titles to his name already, it seems those times come pretty frequently.\n\n\"It's what dreams are made of,\" Littler said.\n\n\"Nothing will ever beat a first world title - for anyone, in any sport, because that's the first time you've done it. But this was all about retaining it.\n\n\"To go back-to-back feels amazing.\"\n\nThe bad news for his competitors is he is only just getting started.\n\nHis hunger for success has not diminished and winning is certainly not getting old for the teenager.\n\n\"I want to dominate everything, I want to try to win everything,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "Anthony Joshua has posted on social media for the first time since he was injured in a car crash that killed two of his close friends in Nigeria.\n\nThe British boxer, 36, was a passenger in a Lexus SUV that collided with a stationary truck on a major expressway near Lagos.\n\nHis close friends and team members Sina Ghami and Latif \"Latz\" Ayodele died in the crash. Their funerals took place at a London mosque on Sunday.\n\nThe former two-time heavyweight champion was taken to hospital and discharged on Wednesday before returning to the UK this weekend.\n\nOn Sunday morning he posted two pictures on Instagram, one which shows him sitting alongside his mother and three women, with one holding a photograph of Ghami.\n\nThe post has the caption: \"My Brothers Keeper.\"\n\nDriver Adeniyi Mobolaji Kayode, 46, was charged at Sagamu Magistrates' Court on Friday. Police sources told the BBC the charges included causing death by dangerous driving.\n\nThe defendant was granted bail of 5m naira (£2,578) and remanded pending his bail conditions being met. The case has been adjourned until 20 January.\n\nJoshua, who was born in Watford, has family roots in Sagamu - a town in Ogun state, near the crash site.\n\nThe 2012 Olympic champion was on his way to visit relatives for New Year celebrations in the town at the time of the collision, a family member told the BBC.\n\nThe boxer had been spending time in Nigeria after his recent victory over American YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul on 19 December.",

    "fullText": "Fraudsters use phishing to steal card details, which fund a spending spree using Apple Pay or Google Pay\n\nYou get a call from your bank and the informed voice asks to you to confirm the personal details they have on file, which you do. You are then asked whether you bought something at an electrical retailer recently for £120 and spent £235 in Birmingham, but neither transaction rings true.\n\nThe caller tells you they have blocked the payments but they must now secure your account, and say they will send you a notification to approve, or a code to pass on to them. You feel under pressure to protect your money, so you do what is asked.\n\nUnfortunately, the person at the other end of the phone is not your bank but a criminal, and they have added your payment card to a digital wallet on one of their many smartphones. At some stage, your account will be emptied by purchases of expensive phones or designer clothes, which will then be sold on.\n\nBanks have seen an increase in the number of attempts to exploit victims using the elaborate digital wallet fraud and have introduced new security measures to counter the threat.\n\nDanai Antoniou, the chief scientist at Gradient Labs, a financial services AI company, says the approach from criminals can appear harmless as the victim is not being asked to move money.\n\n“This is why most people don’t question it. If the notification says ‘never share this with anyone’ (or similar), they will pre-emptively mention it to the customer that this is a routine comment that comes with every notification – which is true, customers do become immune to warnings if they get warnings frequently,” she says.\n\n“Victims often describe feeling panicked and pressured during the call, being told their account is under attack, or that their money is at risk. In that heightened emotional state, approving a notification feels like the responsible thing to do. The victim believes they’re protecting their account, when, in reality, they’re handing over the keys.”\n\nSantander says that digital wallet fraud was the second biggest reason for card scam losses last year, while HSBC has reported an increase over the past 18 months.\n\nUK Finance, the banking trade body, says that the number of attempts has surged, in part because security systems have prevented criminals being successful, forcing them to make more attacks.\n\nThe fraud can start with phishing where the victim provides personal and bank details after a text message that promises, for example, a winter fuel allowance payment, or an offer for cheap products on social media.\n\nAfter a few weeks, enough time for the victim to forget about supplying details, the fraudster will contact them, claiming to be from their bank. They will know which bank because of the details already supplied by the victim.\n\nThey may ask the victim to confirm the address, or postcode, they have on file, in order to portray legitimacy. The criminal will then ask about some transactions, all fabricated, and when the victim says they don’t recognise them, the criminal will claim they have been stopped, and more measures must be taken to secure the account. They will say that a notification is on the way, and the victim should approve it to secure the account.\n\n“The notification the customer receives is entirely legitimate, as it’s the genuine notification your bank sends when a new Apple Pay or Google Pay card is being added to a device, or the bank may send you a code via text, or in the app. They have just added your card into their Apple Pay or Google Pay and you are now receiving a text, or a notification, to approve it,” Antoniou says.\n\nFrom there, the criminals can act quickly and empty the account of the victim. “They drain accounts at high-value merchants, such as tech stores and fashion retailers. The appeal is simple: electronics and designer goods can be quickly resold on the secondary market with minimal loss of profit during the money-laundering process,” she adds.\n\nBanks don’t need your help to protect your account: they have systems in place to freeze and block accounts if needed. “Never trust anyone who calls you from your bank unless you arranged that phone call in advance. If somebody calls, tell them you will call the bank back yourself,” Antoniou says. And don’t use a number they give you: search on the web for the bank’s phone number, or use the one on the back of your physical debit or credit card.\n\nNationwide warns people to be aware of what any one-time passcodes they receive are being used for.\n\nHSBC says it has put in new security measures to counter the threat of wallet fraud and more would be coming this year. “We are regularly reminding customers not to give out their details, such as one-time passcodes, and to treat them as carefully as you would your pin,” it adds.\n\nUK Finance says: “Set up bank alerts in your app, and check your transactions regularly so you know about any suspicious transactions as soon as possible.\n\n“If you think you’ve fallen for a scam it’s important to contact your bank immediately and report it to Report Fraud.”\n\nApple says it is not responsible for approving a card for inclusion in the wallet, but that it gives banks information that they can use to combat fraud.\n\nGoogle did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "description": "The Bengals are looking to end the season on a three-game winning streak when they face the Cleveland Browns at Paycor Stadium Jan. 4.",
    "fullText": "The Cincinnati Bengals host the Cleveland Browns in the Week 18 season finale at Paycor Stadium. Kickoff is scheduled for 1 p.m. and the game will be broadcast on CBS/Local 12 (WKRC-TV).\n\nCincinnati (6-10) is coming off a 37-14 win over the Arizona Cardinals and Cleveland (4-12) is coming off a 13-6 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nBoth teams are eliminated from the playoffs. The Bengals have now missed the playoffs for three straight seasons.\n\nBrowns defensive end Myles Garrett can break the NFL single-season record for sacks (22.5) with one sack.\n\nHere are the keys to a Bengals victory:\n\nBengals wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase has never had 10 or more catches in a game against the Browns. When that stat was mentioned during Chase's weekly press conference he said that he'll make it his goal to change that this week against the Browns.\n\nThe Bengals' offense has been one of the best in the league the past three weeks. Head coach Zac Taylor, quarterback Joe Burrow and Chase all reiterated the importance of winning to end the season and the best way to do that is to put up plenty of points.\n\nBrowns quarterback Shedeur Sanders has shown improvement in the back half of the season since getting the starting nod over Dillon Gabriel earlier in the year.\n\nThe Bengals' defense was opportunistic in nabbing two interceptions in the Week 1 win and will need a similar effort to sweep the season series. Forcing Sanders to make errors in the passing game would go a long way toward helping Cincinnati win the turnover battle and eventually the game.\n\nQuarterback Joe Burrow was emphatic that if he was healthy he was going to play, regardless of whether the Bengals were competing for a playoff spot. Since his return, and the subsequent postseason elimination, Burrow's health and potential for another injury has been discussed ad nauseum on sports talk radio.\n\nKeeping Burrow upright and healthy against Garrett and the Browns' defense is a priority as is avoiding injuries to any other key players on the roster.\n\nIt's the final game of another lost season and while everyone in the organization wants to win, heading into the offseason healthy would be a secondary win.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cincinnati Enquirer: Keys for the Bengals to end the season with victory over Browns",

    "fullText": "Olympic medals frequently come up at auction, but rarely do they come from well-known athletes.\n\nAmerican swimmer Ryan Lochte is one of those exceptions, with three of his gold relay medals selling Saturday night at Goldin for a combined $385,520, including buyer’s premium.\n\nLochte previously sold six medals for a total of $166,000 in 2022 at RR Auctions.\n\nCombined with Saturday’s results, Lochte has sold nine medals for $551,520.\n\nLochte’s 4x200-meter freestyle relay gold medal from the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics led the trio with a final price of $183,000. That medal likely carried a premium as part of Michael Phelps’ run of eight golds.\n\nHis 2004 Athens Summer Olympics 4x200-meter relay gold medal fetched $80,520 while his 2016 Rio Summer Olympics 4x200-meter freestyle relay gold medal sold for $122,000.\n\nIn 2022, Lochte said he was selling his bronze and silver medals because they were “collecting dust.” Proceeds from that sale reportedly went to the Jorge Nation Foundation, a non-profit that was raising money to send terminally ill children on a trip.\n\nAfter facing criticism for selling more medals, Lochte reiterated to fans on social media that the medals weren’t important.\n\n“I never swam for the gold medals,” Lochte wrote on Instagram. “My passion has always been about being one of the best swimmers in the world. Those medals? They were just the cherry on top of an incredible journey.”\n\nLochte now has three more medals in his possession.\n\nEarlier this year, America’s most decorated diver, Greg Louganis, sold two golds and a silver for a whopping $430,865, crushing original estimates.\n\nGold medals from the 1980 U.S. ice hockey team usually sell for at least $250,000.\n\nWant more stories like this? \n\nDarren Rovell is the founder of cllct and one of the country's leading reporters on the collectibles market.

    "description": "The San Francisco 49ers were not good enough Saturday night in a loss to the Seattle Seahawks. Here are the takeaways.",
    "fullText": "We learned a lot about the San Francisco 49ers in their devastating 13-3 loss to the Seattle Seahawks on Saturday night.\n\nThe 49ers were dominated at home, but they still had enough gas to stay within striking distance until the game's final minutes. Their hopes for the No. 1 seed and a first-round bye were dashed as Seattle grabbed the NFC West crown and the top seed in the conference. Now they'll take their banged up roster to the wild card round where they'll be on the road against an NFC division winner.\n\nHere's what we took away Saturday:\n\nSan Francisco's offense was cooking during its six-game win streak and averaged 35.7 points per game during that stretch. Then they faced one of the two best defenses in the NFL and ran into a brick wall where they didn't find the end zone and only managed three points. Brock Purdy was under siege all night. Christian McCaffrey never had room to run. And without Ricky Pearsall their passing attack was confined to a relatively small box that made chunk plays nigh impossible. This was always the worry if the 49ers ran into a team like Seattle or Philadelphia in the postseason, and now they have a distinct possibility of doing so on wild card weekend.\n\nPurdy wasn't bad Saturday night, but some of his limitations shined through. He completed 19-of-27 passes for 127 yards and his one interception was a throw that bounced off McCaffrey's hands. For the most part he was okay and made some nice throws on a fourth-quarter drive that put San Francisco in a goal-to-go situation trailing by 10. However, his inability to create downfield throws through sheer arm strength, and his inability to navigate a messy pocket because of his size were both limiting factors for the 49ers offense Saturday. Overall it wasn't a good night for the offense, but Purdy acquitted himself well in a tough spot with no Trent Williams and no Pearsall.\n\nIt was not a good night for the 49ers defense, but they did enough to keep their team in the game. Two rare missed field goals by Seahawks kicker Jason Myers helped the score from getting out of hand. Seattle also failed to convert a fourth-and-goal from the 4 on their opening drive. There were opportunities for takeaways that didn't get converted, and it was clear down the stretch they just ran out of gas. Seattle's final drive after Purdy's interception drained 8:01 of game clock and effectively put the game away. On that drive the 49ers just didn't have the players or the juice to get over the hump and make a game-altering play.\n\nThe 49ers needed a big play in the third quarter to swing momentum their way, and they got an opportunity when quarterback Sam Darnold fumbled a handoff attempt. 49ers defensive end Yetur Gross-Matos fell on the ball, but it bounced away from him and Seattle recovered at their own 25. Two plays later on a third-and-17, they conceded the drive by tossing to running back Kenneth Walker. Walker ran for 19 yards and a first down. The drive ended with a field goal that put Seattle up 13-3 and effectively ended the game. Had either of those plays gone differently, we may be looking at a different result.\n\nSan Francisco managed at the start of the fourth quarter to put a drive together. Trailing 13-3, they went 64 yards on six plays with Purdy making a couple of nice throws downfield to get the 49ers inside the red zone for the first time. On second-and-goal, Purdy had McCaffrey one-on-one with a linebacker. His throw was tipped at the line, then McCaffrey couldn't handle the pass, it bounced off of his hands and into the arms of Seahawks LB Drake Thomas for a takeaway that ostensibly closed the door on any chance San Francisco had to win.\n\nStout was one player who stood out on the 49ers' defense. He came up with two really strong open-field tackles on third downs to force punts. He's been a nice third-round pick from this year's draft who has developed into a really strong piece of the 49ers' secondary.\n\nWell... that depends! They could face either the Carolina Panthers, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Philadelphia Eagles or Chicago Bears. All of those things depend on how the Atlanta Falcons vs. New Orleans Saints game ends, how the Bears and Eagles games each end, and then how the Los Angeles Rams vs. Arizona Cardinals game ends. We do know they'll certainly be on the road for Round 1, and they'll be on the road for the rest of the postseason if they manage to snag any playoff wins.\n\nMore 49ers: 49ers vs. Seahawks highlights: 49ers fall flat in huge game\n\nThis article originally appeared on Niners Wire: 49ers vs. Seahawks: 7 takeaways, standout players from dreary SF loss",

    "description": "Round one of the Battle of LA goes to the Bruins.",
    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES - Round one of the Battle of Los Angeles goes to the Bruins in a dominant 80-46 display.\n\nA hard fought first quarter that was defined by a nearly immaculate three point performance by No. 17 USC (10-4, 2-1) ended in a 16-16 tie. Beyond that, It was all No. 4 UCLA (14-1, 4-0). The Bruins broke away with a 27 point second quarter and added on from there.\n\nThe Bruins may have the 11th-best offense in the nation and average 87.9 points per game, but UCLA head coach Cori Close had made it a point throughout the season to focus not on scoring, but on the defensive side of the game.\n\n\"Offense cannot be where we find our identity because there's going to be nights where offense is not great. Maybe we don't make shots or we don't have as good a rhythm or they do something we didn't expect,\" Close said. \"Bottom line is: I don't think we played very well offensively, but defense and rebounding was our anchor. After we got through that first part... I thought we were really good on defense and rebounding. That was our anchor and that's the thing I'm most proud of.\"\n\nThe disparities between the two SoCal teams were glaring pieces of defensive evidence as the Bruins held their red-and-gold counterparts to just 10 points in the paint, seven from turnovers and four second chance points. USC's bench was also woefully shutdown, scoring just 10 points total as a unit.\n\nThe Bruins were clearly upset with how they handled themselves in the first quarter, and it didn't take long for that standard of conduct to change.\n\n\"We just had to lock in. It's really just us. I think we had control of the game for the majority of it so it's just making sure that we're setting our own standard and sticking to it,\" senior center Lauren Betts.\n\nOffensively, the Bruins were led once again by Betts, who netted her fifth double-double of the season with 18 points and 12 rebounds. Betts dominated the paint despite fighting against double and triple teams constantly and through her own physicality, her newfound midrange shot and the elite passing ability of her teammates to find her, Betts found the basket again and again.\n\nAnother massive standout was senior guard Gianna Kneepkens, who finished with 15 points and six rebounds to showcase the versatility that she's brought to the Bruins as not only a three point scorer, but an elite inside threat as well both on and off the ball.\n\nDarwin Walker - The Sporting Tribune\n\nUSC guard Jazzy Davidson (9) looks for an open teammate during an NCAA basketball game against the UCLA Bruins on January 3, 2026 in Los Angeles, CA.\n\n\"I thought Gianna particularly did a great job and gave us a really big spark there in the first half. Just the way she crashed the boards, created extra possessions, we got a few extra threes,\" senior guard Kiki Rice said.\n\nRice herself had an outstanding game despite just a two point first half. She finished with 14 points total, but by her own declaration it wasn't simply scoring that was on her mind, but having a well rounded game.\n\nDarwin Walker - The Sporting Tribune\n\nUCLA guard Kiki Rice (1) dribbles the basketball during an NCAA basketball game against USC on January 3, 2026 in Los Angeles, CA.\n\n\"It wasn't really about scoring,\" Rice said. \"I was just focused on finding my teammates. Lauren [Betts] was doing a great job of getting early seals and just let the game come to me. We have such a balanced group with so many points of attack.\"\n\nThe Bruins felt the sting of defeat twice last regular season from the Trojans, and while they got their revenge in last season's Big Ten championship, starting off this regular season with a win is a better start than having to come for revenge later on.\n\n\"We were really disappointed not being the aggressors [in the past] and we feel a lot better today being the aggressors,\" Close said.\"",

    "fullText": "The road to New Japan Pro Wrestling's biggest event of the year is nearing its end as NJPW Wrestle Kingdom 20 is right around the corner, which also means that the career of Hiroshi Tanahashi is just hours away from drawing to a close. The NJPW President will wrestle the final match of his career in the main event of Wrestle Kingdom 20 against his greatest rival, current AEW International Champion Kazuchika Okada, who will be looking to bounce back to winning ways after losing his AEW Continental Championship in the final of the Continental Classic tournament to Jon Moxley.\n\nThere was some debate as to whether Okada and Tanahashi's match should go on last as there were fans who thought the double title match between IWGP World Heavyweight Champion Konosuke Takeshita and IWGP Global Heavyweight Champion Yota Tsuji should main event Wrestle Kingdom 20. However, in the final press conference before the big event, Okada stated that his match closing the show was the obvious choice.\n\n\"A sell out is a great thing. I always wanted that when I was in NJPW, and now I can say that I sold the building out, right? Maybe this sounds out of character, but I always wanted to show Tanahashi a sold out Dome. And the main event! I'm sure the last match will be so good that people might think of leaving, but Okada being in the main event is the obvious choice.\"\n\nWrestle Kingdom 20 will be a historic night for NJPW as it has already set the record for the most money generated at the gate for a NJPW show as more than 50,000 people will be in attendance. This also means that it will be the highest attended NJPW event at the Tokyo Dome since the Antonio Inoki retirement show which took place in April 1998.\n\nPlease credit \"NJPW1972\" when using quotes from this article, and give a H/T to Wrestling Inc. for the transcription.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "fullText": "Manchester United have lost almost all of their creative spark due to injuries and AFCON.\n\nAmad and Bryan Mbeumo’s AFCON departure was swiftly followed by injuries to talisman Bruno Fernandes, Kobbie Mainoo, and Mason Mount.\n\nAnd naturally, that has taken a toll on their performance. This explains why they were ready to trigger the release clause of Antoine Semenyo.\n\nAs things stand, the Bournemouth talisman is heading to Manchester City even though United and Liverpool are still trying to hijack the deal at the last minute.\n\nThings could have been made more straightforward if INEOS had not made a “lowball” offer, as per Football Transfers.\n\nThe Ghanaian was close to agreeing a deal to join the Old Trafford side, with the versatile attacker even agreeing personal terms with the club.\n\nHowever, he later found out that the 20-time English league champions had offered him lower wages than fellow summer signings — Matheus Cunha and Mbeumo.\n\nHe took exception to the fact, and as a result, stayed back at the Vitality Stadium and now, is heading to the Etihad.\n\n“Ruben Amorim met Semenyo in person to assess his character.\n\n“United had agreed personal terms with the player only for Semenyo to discover that their salary offer to him was significantly less than what they’d given Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. This allowed Bournemouth to persuade the player to sign a new contract with a release clause.\n\n“Pretty much all the top clubs in the Premier League have tried to exploit it. Manchester United came back in. Chelsea enquired. Liverpool looked at time. Tottenham made an offer and failed again because he decided Manchester City was the most attractive club to move to.”\n\nMbeumo earns £150,000 gross per week, while Cunha earns £180,000 gross per week (as per capology), and surely INEOS could have offered as much. He currently earns £75,000 gross per week at Bournemouth.\n\nAntoine Semenyo has eight goals, placing him third in the list of goalscorers for the current campaign. Last season, he had notched 13 goals.\n\nHis versatility and ability to produce moments of magic mean United have missed out big time.\n\nFeature image Ryan Pierse via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

He credited his makeup artist Kathleen Vybihal for hiding the injury from the cameras.\n\nHe said he sustained the black eye while breaking up a fight between the 7-year-old twins he has with his wife Michelle Beisner-Buck.\n\nNot all heroes wear capes, but some bring them to work. Our makeup artiste, the great Kathleen Vybihal hid this from high def cameras tonight. Nothing like a knee to the eye while breaking up a fight between 7 year old twins 48 hours before a big game!!! He got me!! pic.twitter.com/mCJMSzosiL\n\n— Joe Buck (@Buck) January 4, 2026\n\nThe after … pic.twitter.com/2nhSYMBDSM\n\n— Joe Buck (@Buck) January 4, 2026\n\nAlongside color commentator and Miami Dolphins consultant Troy Aikman, Buck called a fairly one-sided game, in which the Seahawks beat the Niners 13-3. That's the fewest points the Niners have ever scored under head coach Kyle Shanahan.\n\nSeattle outgained San Francisco 361-173 in total yards. In addition to winning the division, the Seahawks also sewed up the No. 1 seed in the NFC, while the Niners will get either the No. 5 or No. 6 seed, depending on if the Los Angeles Rams win Sunday against the Arizona Cardinals.\n\nThe game was the last of the regular season for Buck and Aikman, who are in their fourth year at ESPN.",

Exceptions exist for coaching changes (a 15-day window that starts five days after the new coach is hired) and CFP playoff participants who play on or after January 12 (five days after final game to enter the portal).\n\nThe spring football transfer window has been eliminated, leaving football with one offseason period for all transfer activity.\n\nThis is a solid article to read about the

    "fullText": "NBA fans react to Jaylen Brown's 50-point outburst vs Clippers originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nJaylen Brown is on a mission for the Boston Celtics.\n\nAs the league expected the Celtics to enter the 2025-2026 NBA season with a gap-year approach, they’ve done the opposite. Brown’s contributions have been a major reason why the Celtics aren’t slipping in the Eastern Conference without Jayson Tatum.\n\nThe Celtics visited the red-hot Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday night, and the momentum meant nothing to Brown. He put together a standout outing, which set NBA fans off.\n\nJaylen Brown vs Clippers:\n\n50 PTS\n6 AST\n16-26 FG\n6-10 3P\n\nJoins Tatum and Bird as the only Celtics with multiple 50-point games. pic.twitter.com/hCnOr4H0eM\n\n— StatMuse (@statmuse) January 4, 2026\n\nIn 35 minutes, Brown shot 18-26 from the field, going 60 percent from three.\n\nThe star dropped 50 points in the Celtics’ blowout win over the Clippers.\n\n@Adin_kiddactiv: MVP and they gave Brunson the POTM over him LOL.\n\n@masonfoster21: All NBA second team, all star starter!\n\n@remiaxyz: jaylen went crazy today\n\nThe points will be all of the talk surrounding Brown, but he contributed in other ways as well. The star guard generated five assists, while turning the ball over just twice. He also had three rebounds.\n\n@TruckBon: oh my gosh JB u are a demon\n\n@Wunderxotwod: LEAGUE MESSED UP\n\n@a1anthony: He is in MVP convos\n\n@Zeke_UTD: Took that player of the month seriously\n\nEarlier this week, the NBA announced the Players of the Month for December. Brown was hoping to see his name representing the Eastern Conference, but he landed an honorable mention.\n\nThe league chose Jalen Brunson of the New York Knicks, which clearly struck a nerve with Brown. Not only did he send out a direct social media reaction to the news, but he addressed it on a live stream, claiming he had the best stretch to close out 2025.\n\nSaturday’s 146-115 win was clearly a statement from Brown.\n\nHeading into Saturday’s action, Brown was averaging 29.5 points, 6.4 rebounds, and 50 assists per game. He is shooting 50 percent from the field and 35 percent from three this season.\n\nAfter the Celtics improved to 21-12 on Saturday, they maintain their spot as the third seed in the Eastern Conference. The Celtics will be back on the court on Monday to host the Chicago Bulls.",

    "fullText": "TV/Stream: Full live match coverage is available via Sky Sports.\n\nRadio: Full live match commentary available via BBC Radio Newcastle (not online)\n\nDon’t forget to follow the blow-by-blow account of the game on the Roker Report Twitter feed (@RokerReport) and check out the player ratings after the full-time whistle at www.RokerReport.sbnation.com!\n\nIt’s our first trip to Spurs’ fancy new stadium today, so it’s been a trip that many of us fancied when the fixtures were released – and it’s a good one to kick off away days in 2026, although I did like the obscured view we used to have at White Hart Lane.\n\nIt’s not just a decent trip because of the first visit to their new toy, but it doesn’t look too bad on paper. We are currently looking at a point per game on the road – nine points from nine games if you were wondering about the maths – but I got a shock when I looked at Spurs’ home form.\n\nAt the time of writing, only Burnley, West Ham United, and Wolves have taken fewer points on their own patch, with just two wins on the board in their nine games so far. The first of those wins came on the opening day against Burnley, and the second was a recent 2-0 victory over Brentford at the beginning of December.\n\nAny manager of Spurs with runs like this has to get slightly nervous – even without the presence of Daniel Levy – but with Thomas Frank, it definitely feels like they will give him the time he needs.\n\nBut our record against Spurs is crap. We haven’t beaten them home or away in any competition in the previous thirteen games, which takes us back to the Darren Bent game in 201,0 where he scored two and missed a penalty in a 3-1 win. At their place, we go back to August 2008 when Roy Keane’s Sunderland beat Juande Ramos’ side 2-1 with goals from Kieran Richardson and Djibril Cisse, who scored on his debut that day.\n\nIt’s been the best part of twenty years since we beat them down there, so hopefully we’re due one.\n\nThe bookies have the Lads at 18/5 to win the game, while Spurs are priced at 4/5, and the draw is 9/4.\n\n[Kane 59’ – (Januzaj sent off 90’)]\n\nSunderland: Pickford, Denayer (McNair), Kirchoff (Khazri), Kone, Djilobodji, Manquillo, Cattermole, Ndong, Pienaar (Watmore), Januzaj, Defoe Substitutes not used: Mika, Love, O’Shea, Gooch\n\nTottenham Hotspur: Lloris, Walker, Vertonghen, Wanyama, Alderweireld, Dier (Davies), Sissoko, Dembele (Lamela), Kane (Janssen), Alli, Son Substitutes not used: Vorm, Trippier, Winks, Eriksen\n\nI reckon we’ll frustrate them today and take a point.",

    "title": "Starting XI: Will Regis Le Bris Make Changes For Sunderland’s Trip To Tottenham?",
    "description": "Is this the team that will take on Spurs?",
    "fullText": "After a hard fought, intense game against Manchester City only a couple of days ago, it’d be tempting for Regis Le Bris to rotate his squad a bit to prevent injuries and get some fresh legs into the team – however the reality is we don’t have much room for manouvere, so in reality it’s going to be the same 13-14 players who’ve either started or played from the bench that we see in action today at the Spurs stadium. The biggest question mark surrounds Brian Brobbey, who came off on Thursday with a tight hammy, and whether we stick with the same formation we played against City. Here’s how I think we could line up.\n\nAnother superb display from Roefs – the fact only Arsenal and Manchester City have conceded fewer goals than us this season is testament to the impact he’s had, and the defence in front of him too.\n\nGeertruida dropped into right back against City as we played Trai Hume ahead of him – however I think we’ll go back to a regular back four today, with Hume in his more traditional role. Dan Ballard could be fit, however with two more games this week I suspect we’ll see him on the bench for this one, with Mukiele and Alderete continuing in the centre of the defence, and Dennis Cirkin getting a game – which will be brilliant for him as he returns to his former club. Cirkin looked every inch a Premier League quality full back against Manchester City, and he’ll be looking to build on that today.\n\nIf we play that four man defence, we’ll see Geertruida step back into midfield, alongside Granit Xhaka and Enzo Le Fee. Le Fee produced probably his best performance of the season against City, and he and Xhaka really added the intensity that was missing from the Leeds game. Same again today, please!\n\nHopefully Brobbey will be fit enough to start today, and if so he will do – Wilson Isidor’s looked off the pace in recent weeks, and we need Brobbey’s hold up play. If he is fit, then expect Simon Adingra – who I thought played will again against City – to play on the left, with Elezier Mayenda on the right. If Brobbey doesn’t make it, Romaine Mundle will likely come in, with Mayenda playing through the middle.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFor fourteen sides, Week 18 of the regular season represents the beginning of a new season — one in which each side's result is far more consequential than the last.\n\nFor the other 18 teams that make up the NFL ecosystem, Week 18 is simply a means to an end. It is a merciful close to a merciless season, one in which splendor and delight turns to wickedness as losses pile up. Their titles lose their luster upon the conclusion of the year, while they prepare for hibernation during a brisk winter and spring.\n\nEven in the dark, though, there is light. Because the league's worst sides are rewarded with a rather remarkable platform — draft picks.\n\nWhile those atop the NFL standings are jostling for postseason seeding, a similarly contentious battle is taking place in the cellar. The Raiders, Giants, Jets, Titans and Cardinals all sit at the bottom of the league standings, meaning they'll land a crown jewel of sorts in terms of draft position.\n\nWhile that's not a guaranteed indicator of success, it can prove consequential. Sides like the Patriots, Seahawks and Broncos all built through the draft, crafting Super Bowl-caliber rosters one pick at a time.\n\nSo, just what does the NFL Draft order look like after Week 18? Here's a look at team's first-round draft positions during the final week of the regular season.\n\nOhio State steals show in first round of 2026 NFL mock draft\n\nRanking 10 best NFL Draft prospects in 2025 College Football Playoff\n\nMORE: Who goes No. 1 in SN's latest mock draft?\n\nHere's a look at the top 10 prospects in the 2026 NFL Draft, based on SN's Vinnie Iyer's rankings.\n\nQuarterbacks remain en vogue, with Indiana's Fernando Mendoza and Oregon's Dante Moore drawing rave reviews for their skill sets. They're not the only players tabbed for success at the big-league level, however.\n\nThere are a handful of defenders whose names have sparkled on scouting reports across the league, led by Miami EDGE Rueben Bain Jr., Texas Tech EDGE David Bailey and Ohio State stars Arvell Reese and Caleb Downs.\n\nFurther down the board, there are a few skill players garnering interest. Carnell Tate is making waves despite struggling with injuries in his junior year, while Notre Dame's Jeremiyah Love and Arizona State's Jordyn Tyson have been tipped for brilliance at the big-league level. Suffice to say, there should be plenty of talent on display when Roger Goodell steps to the stage in Pittsburgh come April.",

    "title": "Talking Tactics: How Le Bris Masterminded A Pair Of Solid Draws",
    "description": "What did Regis Le Bris do to take two points from games against Leeds and Manchester City?",
    "fullText": "In Sunderland’s final fixture of the 2025 Calendar Year, Leeds United returned to the Stadium of Light since the epic 2-2 draw last season that saw Evan Meslier comically throw one into his own net with seconds to spare.\n\nLeeds entered this one as the form team in the league, having dismantled Crystal Palace at Elland Road the week prior & Sunderland were held to a draw on the day, having sustained several heavy waves of Leeds pressure. How did Le Bris match up to Farke, and who came out on top in the tactical battle?\n\nIn an eyebrow-raising selection, Dan Ballard unfortunately missed this one due to a suspected Achilles injury suffered against Brighton, and therefore Dennis Cirkin came in to replace him in an otherwise unchanged Sunderland side.\n\nGiven the absence of Ballard, Mukiele moved inside to partner Omar Alderete, and Hume assumed the role of an orthodox right-back with Cirkin partnering on the opposite flank. Simon Adingra & Chris Rigg retained their positions on the wings, whilst Brian Brobbey acted as Sunderland’s focal point in attack for Le Bris.\n\nWith Daniel Farke’s switch to three central defenders causing a reassurance, Sunderland didn’t look to match them up but instead play their own 4-3–3 in a proactive attempt to take the game to Leeds as opposed to seasons prior where Sunderland may have changed shape reactively to the opposition.\n\nDaniel Farke retained the same side that ran out as victors against Crystal Palace in the same system that has sparked a new-look Leeds United during the festive period. Leeds utilise their size & physicality to put pressure on teams due to their lineup selection & against Sunderland, this was no different.\n\nLeeds play with three central defenders supported by two wingbacks who provide their natural positional width, whilst also deploying three central midfielders to retain control over the central third of the pitch, whilst their two forwards work to run the channels and provide an outlet, and the rest of the team pushes up to support.\n\nVery much a 3-5-2 in possession, which shifts to a static & compact 5-3-2 out of possession, means that Farke aims to crowd the central areas and make it difficult for teams to play through the lines in midfield. Instead, forcing teams to make long diagonal switches with an expectations that their aerial dominance will win the individual duels against opposition wingers and fullbacks.\n\nWhilst Farke would consider himself an expansive coach focused on possession & ‘total football’, his efforts so far this season with Leeds, following their domination of the EFL in 24/25, have struggled to yield a points return. By leaning into a more pragmatic style of play and sacrificing his footballing morals, he’s been able to unsettle teams and generate a stronger points return for Leeds.\n\nSunderland started the game off brightly and looked to utilise their winger mismatches against the wide central defenders of Leeds, with Rigg & Adingra drawing both Pascal Struijk and Joe Rodon out of position to engage with them 1v1 and created several openings in the first half. Brian Brobbey caused all three central defenders problems at various points by switching across and winning his individual duels to help sustain Sunderland Pressure forcing several early long throws and corners. Nordi Mukiele & Adingra both saw efforts saved or blocked as Leeds were restricted to countering when Sunderland attacks broke down.\n\nAs the Leeds midfield three were pinned into their own half, Sunderland were able to sustain pressure and saw Brian Brobbey close down Joe Rodon after a loose pass as a clash of knees took the Welsh defender down for treatment. With the Welshman clearly struggling, Sunderland attacked down their left and won a throw which Mukiele was able to launch in and cause his usual carnage even in the absence of Ballard.\n\nGranti Xhaka was able to demonstrate once again why he’s topping the assist charts for midfielders in the Premier League this season as he whipped a beautifully disguised pass into Adingra before the Ivorian whipped the ball back across Serri’s goal to open his account on Wearside in fashion.\n\n5 – Only Bruno Fernandes and Rayan Cherki (7 each) have more Premier League assists than Granit Xhaka (5) this season; his five assists are the most by a Sunderland player before January in a top-flight campaign since Andy Reid in 2009-10 (6). Wand. pic.twitter.com/5enhAlGUhi\n\n— OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) December 28, 2025\n\nWith that assist, Xhaka now ties the lead for the most assists from a midfielder this season and places him in some rather elite company for someone who the outside noise would tell you was beyond his best years when he signed for Sunderland.\n\nSunderland looked to capitalise on a stumbling Leeds team and wanted to double their advantage before the break, with the opposition being forced to push on in the hope of an equaliser before the half. Trai Hume was well-placed to deny Brendan Aaronson from equalising before Brian Brobbey saw two guilt-edged chances come his way just as the half was coming to a close.\n\nHis first effort came from a sumptuous move form Chris Rigg after drifting inside and shaking hi defender in a way that demonstrated some of the quality he has for such a young age, his lofted ball tee’d up Brian Brobbey who’s first time effort squirmed underneath Lucas Perri but without the purchase on it that he wanted it was cleared off the line as Brobbey hit the deck. Only a minute later, he saw a teasing cross reached back post after a run down the line from Adingra; however, Brobbey was only able to hit the frame of the post and bar as the ball crashed out.\n\nBrobbey’s two chances created an xG of 0.2 & 0.22 respectively and therefore, with a total xG of 0.44 generated within the space of a minute, Brobbey will be frustrated he wasn’t able to capitalise and probably put the game to bed before the break.\n\nFollowing Sunderland’s opener, Joe Rodon went down again after a second challenge with Adingra and forced Daniel Farke into a change as he was replaced by Ayo Tanaka.  Leeds opted to switch formation and returned to their usual 4-3-3 system with Ethan Amapdu sitting in the base of midfield and Anton Statch & Tanaka just ahead of him.\n\nWith Leeds now matching up to Sunderland from a shape perspective, gone were the central overloads & half spaces for Sunderland to exploit, and the game changed completely. With Sunderland’s makeshift midfield lacking the usual ground covering of Noah Sadiki, Geertruida was stuck between man-marking & zonally pressing and therefore Xhaka was dragged all over the midfield, and Sunderland showed for it.\n\nAs the second half started, an overzealous press from Dennis Cirkin forced the remainder of the team to commit and resulted in Xhaka having to cover on the eventual breakaway, causing Calvert-Lewin to stroll in between the two Sunderland defenders and level the game.\n\nIt’s worth noting that whilst Cirkin was the one initially out of position leading the press, the goal ultimately comes from Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s ability to ghost into the box in an area that Xhaka usually patrols and blocks passing lanes, preventing any clear shots on goal from occurring. Due to Xhaka’s requirement to press the onrushing Aaronson, Sunderland find themselves exposed, and within a minute of the restart, it’s a level game.\n\nThe following 20-minute spell saw Leeds take control, and in a spell that felt like it was never going to end, Sunderland had to sustain waves of Leeds pressure. A miscontrolled touch by Jayden Bogle prevented the visitors from finding a second before a string of tame efforts fell into the hands of Robin Roefs. Sunderland seemingly dwindled on every loose ball and lost every second ball for a spell, and looked like they couldn’t get their foot on the ball to slow the pace of the game down.\n\nWHICH EPL side is elite at REDUCING SHOT QUALITY?\n\nThere’s been a lot of discussion around Aston Villa “overperforming” XG this season, but far less about how they defend.\n\nTwo teams can concede the same quality of chances yet still face different shots.\n\nTo show this, we… pic.twitter.com/vgEV7K02PN\n\n— Pythagoras In Boots ⚽️ (@pythaginboots) December 29, 2025\n\nLooking at the information above, it’s important to note this in the context of a real game versus the numbers that are seen online. Much has been made of Sunderland overperforming this season; however, as can be seen, Sunderland actually ranks second in the league for PSxG. To explain this briefly, this figure determines the shot quality that opponents are generating against Sunderland, and therefore, a larger negative value indicates that Sunderland’s defenders turn opposition shots into worse than expected chances due to their ability to restrict/smother/block or pressure opposition players into taking poor shots.\n\nWhilst Sunderland may not be scoring at the rate they’d like, they’re making things incredibly difficult for opposition attackers and that can be contextualised during the spell of pressure exerted by Leeds during the period. Despite the ball being in play and on the edge of Sunderland’s box for large swathes, Roefs wasn’t forced into making any tough saves and was able to command his area well to collect incoming crosses with relative ease, meaning that for all Leeds positional dominance, they were unable to break the deadlock.\n\nWith Sunderland’s unbeaten home record on the line as we entered 2026, Le Bris welcomed Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City in the hopes of stopping the in-form juggernauts who were looking to extend their nine-game winning streak.\n\nIn a shock twist, Le Bris opted for a 4-4-2 shape in this one as one change saw Chris Rigg drop out for Eliezer Mayenda. Despite being a risky strategy, Le Bris decided that a 4-2-4 system was the most effective way to nullify the Manchester City build-up, with the knowledge that Donnarumma isn’t the most comfortable with the ball at his feet.\n\nIn somewhat of a bold selection choice, Le Bris opted to shuffle Geertruida to the right back position and stuck with a midfield duo of both Granit Xhaka & Enzo Le Fée, of which both players were riding the suspension tightrope in their final game before suspensions were lifted. Elsewhere, Trai Hume shifted across to right midfield to provide support on the wing whilst also acting as an outlet from aerial balls to relieve pressure.\n\nPep Guardiola stuck with his usual 4-1-4-1 formation as Phil Foden, Ryan Cherki, Savinho & Bernardo Silva all rotated in front of the sole pivot of Nico Gonzalez, who protected the back four. With Rodri & Jeremy Doku only fit enough to make the bench, Guardiola left himself with reinforcements on the bench if required.\n\nCity utilise the Pep Guardiola philosophy of total control with an emphasis on lulling the opposition into a false sense of security through their relentless passing before slicing through low blocks with ease due to having the World’s Greatest Centre Forward ready to dispatch any opportunities when they do arise.\n\nIn a tactical battle which Le Bris clearly edged, Sunderland were able to totally nullify Manchester City’s build-up play by deploying a 4-2-4 press, which limited Donnarumma’s options from goal kicks and forced the Italian shot stopper to pump the ball long at every instance.\n\nOn the other side of the ball, Sunderland were really clever in their ability to play through the City press, which so many teams find smothering, whether they face it home or away. By dragging Bernado Silva over to one side of the defence, Roefs was able to split the lines with a drilled pass into Le Fée on the half turn and spring Sunderland out countless times in the first half.\n\nRoefs’ calmness on the ball can’t be underestimated with Haaland bearing down on him at every opportunity, and a tactical timeout was required by Guardiola on the half-hour to adjust their press, and he showed a real level of respect to Le Bris for totally outwitting Pep in this one.\n\nSunderland were subject to City’s usual approach of death by possession and had to suffer long swathes without the ball and break when they had the chance. That being said, the compact shape and tactical instructions not to engage City’s wingers until they entered the box worked well and prevented Cherki and Savinho from creating any opportunities of real note during the opening half.\n\nConversely, Sunderland’s threat on the break was evident, and the strike pairing of Brobbey & Mayenda both saw good chances equalled by the City shot stopper. Following on from the information above regarding PsxG, looking at the graph below, it’s clear that Sunderland are doing an excellent job of limiting the opposition to low-quality shots despite the xG statistics.\n\n👉Shot conceded per game against xG conceded per shot for the teams in English Premier League 2025-2026.

In fact, they won’t play again until September. The Chiefs missed the playoffs for the first time in 11 years after stumbling their way to elimination in mid-December.\n\nWho will fill the Chiefs-sized void on the AFC side of the bracket? Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills are strong candidates, but they ceded the AFC East to the up-and-coming New England Patriots. The Denver Broncos, meanwhile, have positioned themselves as legitimate Super Bowl contenders behind a stellar defense.\n\nThe NFC includes a few more familiar faces, including the San Francisco 49ers and reigning champion Philadelphia Eagles, but it would be hard to say one particular team separated itself during the regular season. For that reason, the path to Super Bowl 60 could be more unpredictable than ever before.\n\nHere’s a complete look at the NFL playoff bracket and schedule, including TV information.\n\nMORE:Six reasons Chiefs missed the playoffs\n\nThis section will be updated when the bracket is finalized.\n\nMORE:2025 Fantasy Football Awards\n\nLocation: Levi's Stadium, Santa Clara, CA\n\nSuper Bowl 60 will be played at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, the home of the 49ers.\n\nLevi's Stadium opened in 2014 and previously hosted the Denver Broncos' Super Bowl 50 win over the Carolina Panthers.\n\nESPN, ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, Amazon Prime Video\n\nThe NFL playoffs will air on many of the same networks that broadcasted regular season games.\n\nCBS, Fox, NBC, ABC/ESPN and Amazon Prime Video will all host wild-card playoff games, with Prime Video's game the only exclusively streaming playoff game this year.

The Commanders elevated DT Ricky Barber and WR River Cracraft from the practice squad, as they did in their most recent game when they hosted the Cowboys.\n\nQB Marcus Mariota and LT Laremy Tunsil are also now officially declared as \"out\" for the final game against the Eagles. 39-year-old third quarterback Josh Johnson will get his second start for Washington in 2025 after starting for them in 2018 under then-head coach Jay Gruden.\n\nBarber was a pleasant surprise, making some fine plays against the Cowboys, including his first NFL quarterback sack. Barber is undoubtedly the right choice for someone to be elevated for the final game. He is 6-3, 295, a 24-year-old rookie out of UCF.

    "fullText": "Will Todd Bowles, Jason Licht be fired if Buccaneers miss playoffs? originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers have ruled the NFC South for several years now.\n\nThe New Orleans Saints won the division in 2020, but the Bucs have won it in each season since then. The team looked to be coasting toward another title in 2025 after a 5-1 start to the season.\n\nHowever, since that point, the team has gone just 3-8. As a result of that horrendous run, Bucs fans are getting antsy.\n\nLuckily, the Bucs ended their regular season with a win over the Carolina Panthers on Saturday. If the Panthers would have won, they would've clinched the NFC South and knocked the Bucs out of postseason contention.\n\nEven though the Bucs won, though, they still need some help. The New Orleans Saints have to beat the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday for the Bucs to clinch the division. If the Falcons win, the Bucs, Panthers, and Falcons will all finish with 8-9 records and the Panthers get the crown.\n\nIf the Falcons win and the Bucs miss the playoffs, are head coach Todd Bowles and general manager Jason Licht in trouble? One NFL insider provided an update on that front Saturday.\n\nAccording to Russini, the Bucs historically prefer to wait until the end of the season before making personnel decisions. It would definitely be disappointing to miss the playoffs, but Russini doesn't think either man is in danger.\n\n“Coach Todd Bowles and general manager Jason Licht, who both signed multiyear extensions in June, have won division titles each of the last three seasons and appear to be safe even if the Bucs miss the playoffs,\" Russini explained.\n\nBowles took over as the head coach of the Bucs ahead of the 2022 season. The Bucs have made the playoffs in each of his seasons so far, and the coach has a 34-33 overall record.\n\nBowles didn't inherit the best situation either, as the roster dealt with a ton of turnover after Tom Brady's retirement. Still, the team has won the NFC South in each of Bowles' seasons.\n\nThe Bucs will undoubtedly be glued to the TV on Sunday to see if they are going to be playing in the postseason again. Regardless, it seems like the head coach and general manager will be around for at least one more season.\n\nDolphins predicted to cut star wide receiver in 2026\n\nCardinals predicted to replace Kyler Murray with 2026 rookie\n\nGiants predicted to add elite weapon for Jaxson Dart\n\nRussell Wilson posts cryptic message among bad season\n\nSteelers predicted to replace Aaron Rodgers with college star\n\nPete Carroll predicted to be one-and-done with Raiders",

    "fullText": "Conference plays continue tonight with just one game as Washington heads east to Bloomington to face the Hoosiers.\n\nIndiana will try to win their third game in a row tonight against Washington. The Hoosiers opened the season with seven straight wins before an upset loss at Minnesota, followed by losses to Louisville and Kentucky. They did pick up a win against Penn State, putting them at 1-1 in league play heading into the season. While Indiana got off to a hot start it’s worth mentioning that they’ve yet to truly land a marquee win under new head coach Darian DeVries, with their best win coming against 9-5 Kansas State.\n\nWashington hasn’t made the jump many fans were hoping for in Danny Sprinkle’s second season with the team. While the Huskies did split their opening week in the Big Ten, with a win over ranked USC, Washington is only 9-4 and there loss two weeks ago to Seattle was not a positive sign. They desperately need a win here with a road game against Purdue on Wednesday followed by a four game stretch that includes three top 15 ranked teams in Michigan, Michigan State and Nebraska.\n\nIndiana hasn’t always been consistent, but the offensive production has been solid and they’ve fared better shooting outside than in years past. With four players averaging double figures, led by Lamar Wilkerson’s 19 points per game, Indiana’s offense is more than capable of scoring the ball. That should prove an advantage over a defensive focused Huskies program that is ranked 75th offensively per KenPom. Washington is shooting worse from the field (45.3%), three (32.2%) and commits more turnovers than Indiana.\n\nInjuries are also an issue tonight, with second leading Husky scorer Wesley Yates III out with a wrist injury suffered against Seattle. The guard was averaging 14.9 points per game and was a key contributor on the offensive side of the ball. Desmond Claude and Zoom Diallo are also averaging just north of 14 points per game and will be relied on more heavily down the stretch. Forward Hannes Steinbach has been key with 18.1 points and 12 rebounds per game. If Indiana can slow down the Huskies inside that will go a long way, especially with Washington’s guard not being the best perimeter shooters.\n\nHome court advantage is also going to be a big factor for a couple of reasons. Besides the fact that it’s hard to win on the road in the Big Ten and the difficulty of going into Assembly Hall, the Huskies face a notable disadvantage when it comes to the traveling required for whenever they hit the road. Last season Washington went 2-8 on the road in league play, with two wins against Minnesota and Penn State by a combined five points.\n\nBoth of these teams could use a win to get 2026 off to a strong start, especially with some of the looming questions heading into conference play. With tonight’s game being played in Bloomington and Indiana being more efficient on the offensive side of the ball the Hoosiers should be able to get their second Big Ten win of the season.",

    "description": "People’s ability to make new friends reflects the strength of the “friendship market” they are in.",
    "fullText": "When people find that they are having a hard time making new friends, they often blame their own awkwardness — some failure on their part. As a sociologist who studies how people connect, I’ve interviewed more than 150 people about friendship. One woman told me a typical story: She had moved to a new town after college and said that the conversations she struck up at coffee shops, work and yoga didn’t seem to go anywhere. Forging new relationships felt hopeless. “I’m not good at it,” she said.\n\nYet she, like most of us, could pinpoint times in her life when making friends seemed easier. Across two decades of studying friendship, I’ve found that people’s ability to make new friends doesn’t come and go at random. Instead, it reflects, in large part, the strength of what I call the “friendship market” they are in.\n\nIn a thriving friendship market, a majority of people in a particular setting are interested in “buying” or “selling” friendship. For example, middle schoolers merging into a new high school, or first-year students arriving at college. New connections abound.\n\nBut we spend much of our lives in weaker friendship markets, where people are open to conversation, but not connection. A parent shows up at a P.T.A. meeting, and even if others are friendly, they keep their distance. Or people moves to a new city for work, and acquaintances don’t turn toward their bids for connection. Even intentionally putting yourself out there doesn’t inspire reciprocation if a friendship market has closed: Others already have fully formed friend groups.\n\nIn adulthood, open friendship markets become harder to find. But there’s a key to finding new ones: a shifting sense of self. We define ourselves through our relationships with friends. These connections help us to construct our desired selves, who we are, and who we are becoming.\n\nThe key, then, is not just to start an activity or join a club so you can meet new people. It’s to join one related to a new sense of self or an identity you’re looking to deepen. Pregnant women, for example, will look for friendships in prenatal classes — not only to find people who understand their experience but also to reaffirm their emerging identity as a mom.\n\nMilestones make friendship markets easier to find, but markets exist for all sorts of identities, big and small. One woman I spoke to heard about a coffee club as she was starting to consider herself a coffee aficionado. Another found friendship in a pride club; although she had come out as gay years before, she felt that her queer identity was becoming a more important part of who she was. Friends connected to emerging identities bring out new sides of us. One interviewee told me that she was not religious growing up. As she started to explore Christianity, she joined a Bible study group and said she was her most “upbeat” and “cheery” self with the friends she made there.\n\nWe’ve all seen how much closer you can feel to someone when your identities change together. I worked in an office for five years with someone whom I did not know well until we were both pregnant together — both first-time moms with the same due date. We ended up taking walks, having lunches and getting to know each other as we talked through our excitement and worries about the ways our lives would change. As our identities shifted, our friendships did as well.\n\nEven embracing less favorable identities opens up new markets. Several people I interviewed told me about a group for single parents. Remembering the challenging period after their breakups, club members went out of their way to welcome new entrants. One member noted how her new friends offered her support as she raised a child on her own. Eventually she got married, which booted her from the club, but two people she met there remained among her closest friends years later.\n\nTo be clear, being aware of “friendship markets” does not mean that those friendships are transactional. Friendships are not commodities or disposable. But they are also not always readily available. Everyone needs to make sure to seek them out, optimizing the possibility of connection in our busy, sometimes isolated-feeling lives.\n\nI recommend a New Year’s resolution: Do the work to find new friendship markets in 2026, rather than waiting passively for new connections to find you. Even those with active social lives and healthy friendships benefit from new relationships that reaffirm who they are. These connections have been proven to bring us joy, fulfill our basic need to connect and help us to live healthier, longer lives.\n\nSo the next time making new friends feels challenging, remember the structural role of friendship markets rather than blaming yourself. If you take a class not just to learn a new skill but also to deepen a part of yourself, you may find your people.\n\nJanice McCabe is an associate professor of sociology at Dartmouth College and the author of the books “Making, Keeping, and Losing Friends” and “Connecting in College.”\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Signum previously hosted similar trips for asset managers and hedge funds to visit Syria and Ukraine.\n\n\"People have seen this coming, especially very smart investors, and many of them have actually bought bonds in anticipation of this,\" Myers said. \"But there's a very strong degree of cautious optimism, even more so than we saw with Syria, just because this is a United States-directed action.\"\n\n\"The United States will play a pivotal role in everything, especially the Venezuelan economy, starting today,\" Myers added, \"So, I think the reaction has been more enthusiastic than perhaps other situations like this.\"",

A weaker Russian economy will increase the probability that the war in Ukraine ends sooner and on more favorable terms for Ukraine. And Putin will be sleeping in his safe room from this point going forward.\"\n\nGao is a senior fellow at the Center for International Governance Innovation and a law professor at Singapore Management University. In a series of posts on X, he said the raid on Caracas ushered in \"the brave new world of international law.\"\n\n\"Maduro's capture has triggered the biggest revival of international law since Grotius — and overnight turned everyone on X into an international law wonk, eager to compare Venezuela to Taiwan,\" he wrote.\n\n\"But China has never treated the Taiwan issue as a matter of international law,\" he continued. \"It has always been framed as an internal affair, with Taiwan regarded as a renegade province. The reason China has not acted is not because it lacks legal justification, but because it lacks the capability. Thus, US ops in Venezuela provide China with no additional legal justification.\"\n\nThe Democratic senator from Massachusetts is a former Harvard Law professor who holds deep expertise in bankruptcy and consumer finance. In a post on X, she wrote that Trump's action to seize Maduro, \"no matter how terrible a dictator he is — is unconstitutional and threatens to drag the US into further conflicts in the region.\"\n\n\"What does it mean that the US will 'run' Venezuela, and what will Trump do next around the world?\" Warren wrote. \"The American people voted for lower costs, not for Trump's dangerous military adventurism overseas that won't make the American people safer.\"\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO spent most of Saturday posting praise for the Trump administration and the military operations in Venezuela, posting that it was \"heartwarming to see so many Venezuelans celebrating their country freed from a brutal tyrant.\"\n\nIn another post, Musk retweeted a White House image of Maduro aboard the USS Iwo Jima after being apprehended, with the caption \"Congratulations, President Trump! This is a win for the world and a clear message to evil dictators everywhere.\"\n\nMusk and Trump have had a tumultuous relationship over the years, alternating between appearing to be close allies and trading sharp criticisms in the media.",

    "description": "Despite the promise of alleviating the main memory bottleneck, and the existence of commercial hardware implementations, techniques for Near-Data Processing have seen relatively little real-world deployment. The idea has received renewed interest with the appearance of disaggregated or \"far\" memory, for example in the use of CXL memory pools.\n  However, we argue that the lack of a clear OS-centric abstraction of Near-Data Processing is a major barrier to adoption of the technology. Inspired by the channel controllers which interface the CPU to disk drives in mainframe systems, we propose memory channel controllers as a convenient, portable, and virtualizable abstraction of Near-Data Processing for modern disaggregated memory systems.\n  In addition to providing a clean abstraction that enables OS integration while requiring no changes to CPU architecture, memory channel controllers incorporate another key innovation: they exploit the cache coherence provided by emerging interconnects to provide a much richer programming model, with more fine-grained interaction, than has been possible with existing designs.",

    "description": "It's time to wind down.",
    "fullText": "The Large Hadron Collider is going to be shut down — not permanently, but for a pretty long time — and the famous atom smasher’s eventual final retirement is also something that top scientists are now considering.\n\nA 16-mile ring-shaped tunnel near the Swiss-French border, the underground particle accelerator is designed to replicate the cosmos’s extreme conditions shortly after the big bang by whipping up particles to near light speed, at which point physics begins to become extremely weird and counterintuitive. In 2012, scientists used the LHC to discover the existence of the Higgs boson, an elementary particle that, through incredibly esoteric quantum properties, is essentially responsible for giving all other particles their mass.\n\nEven something responsible for one of the most important scientific discoveries in history needs a facelift, however. Beginning in June, engineers will start upgrading the device so that it can carry out ten times the number of particle collisions it currently can do, something that will allow for far more experiments to be conducted, yielding still more troves of data. The project, dubbed the high-luminosity LHC, will take some five years to complete — and while surely worth it in the long run, that’s an immense amount of down time.\n\nRest assured, the LHC won’t be going dark without leaving physicists quite a bit of homework to complete before its return, according to Mark Thomson, the new director general of CERN, the intergovernmental organization and physics lab that oversees the particle accelerator.\n\n“The machine is running brilliantly and we’re recording huge amounts of data,” Thomson, a professor of experimental particle physics at the University of Cambridge, told The Guardian. “There’s going to be plenty to analyze over the period. The physics results will keep on coming.”\n\nThe LHC will be offline during almost all of Thomson’s term, which started on New Year’s Day. In fact, CERN doesn’t expect the high-luminosity LHC to be operational again until mid-2030. But while it may sound like Thomson is taking the reins at a less exciting period in the device’s history, he says he’s thrilled to be giving it a makeover.\n\n“It’s an incredibly exciting project,” Thomson told the newspaper. “It’s more interesting than just sitting here with the machine hammering away.”\n\nThomson is also taking charge as CERN is planning the LHC’s successor. The leading candidate to replace it, per The Guardian, is the gargantuan Future Circular Collider, which at a proposed 56 miles in circumference would make the Hadron look like the kiddie pool. The first stage, designed to smash together electrons and positrons — the latter are the former’s anti-matter counterpart — would be built in the late 2040s, with another stage taking its place in the 2070s to accelerate protons to even higher speeds.\n\nThe FCC’s fate, though, is anything but certain. Its slated cost of nearly $19 billion is too much for CERN to pay on its own, according to The Guardian, and there’s also questions swirling over whether huge particle accelerators represent the best way to probe some of the biggest questions in science, such as the nature of dark matter and dark energy.\n\nThomson, though, is still a believer in the big atom smasher.\n\n“We’ve not got to the point where we have stopped making discoveries and the FCC is the natural progression. Our goal is to understand the universe at its most fundamental level,” he told The Guardian. “And this is absolutely not the time to give up.”\n\nMore on physics: Giant Chinese Orb Detects “Ghost Particles” While Buried Under Mountain",

    "description": "A new PLA video appears to show a Chengdu J-20 stealth fighter near Taiwan raises questions less about detection failure than strategic intent.",
    "fullText": "New footage has been released that seems to show a Chinese Chengdu J-20 stealth fighter flying close to a Taiwanese airbase during a recent military exercise. Purportedly taken during the recent “Justice Mission 2025,\" this has sparked debate as to whether the aircraft was able to approach undetected or not.\n\n“China’s J-20 stealth fighter flew within visual range of Taiwan’s coastline. The Taiwanese failed to detect the J-20. It would’ve been a propaganda coup if Taiwan got a photo of the J-20 with their F-16 sniper targeting pod. This happened around Checheng township in Pingtung, at the very southern tip of Taiwan,” wrote a defence analyst on X.\n\nWhile hard to confirm, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has claimed that one of its J-20s managed to fly close to Taiwan's Pingtung airbase. According to reports, this incident occurred on Tuesday (Dec 30) during the second day of the exercise.\n\nIt is important to note that these claims have yet to be confirmed by third parties, notably whether the J-20 was actually able to penetrate Taiwanese airspace in the first place.\n\nIf true, then such an occurrence would be very worrying for Taiwanese defense forcesm notably how this could happen in the first place. It could, of course, just be a bluff from the PLA to make Taiwan question its defensive readiness against Chinese forces.\n\nWhile no missiles were fired or lives lost, the supposed incursion by China's fifth-generation J-20 will not be without consequences. Likely, Taiwan will now have to assume worst-case scenarios and spend some time investigating what happened.\n\nThey will want to know if the J-20 was able to find radar blind spots in its air defense and take corrective actions accordingly. That will come at a cost for Taiwan.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLsV8flG1Q4&pp=ygUTSi0yMCBUYWl3YW4gYWlyYmFzZQ%3D%3D\n\nThe focus on Pingtung is also interesting as it is one of the nation's key airbases. It has some critical training and sortie-running infrastructure for the Taiwanese air force and is a cornerstone of its air defense.\n\nIf China can operate stealth aircraft near that area (even occasionally), it compresses Taiwan’s reaction time in a real crisis. That is strategically more important than whether this specific flight happened exactly as claimed.\n\nSo far, Taiwan has remained silent on the matter, with key officials neither confirming nor denying China's claims. This is likely deliberate to prevent China from taking a public relations victory.\n\nIf they deny the claim, this will look to some like Taiwan is covering up for a failure of its air defenses. Confirming the event would also validate PLA propaganda.\n\nWhether the J-20 incursion occurred or not, it has wider implications for the region, too. Firstly, it helps to normalize PLA proximity to Taiwan and blurs peacetime versus wartime behaviour.\n\nIt also serves as a training for PLA forces under realistic conditions, and can be used by them to sow doubt and confusion. So while the claim could be fictitious at worst or exaggerated at best, it will have very real impacts on Taiwan one way or the other.",

    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage rates today are in familiar territory: almost exactly where they were one week ago. According to Zillow, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.01%, and the 15-year fixed rate is just a little lower than last week, at 5.44%.\n\nSee which lenders have the best mortgage rates this week.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nDiscover 8 strategies for getting the lowest mortgage rates.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nWant to refinance your mortgage in early 2026? Here's what to do.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how today's interest rates would affect your monthly mortgage payments.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders. You also have the option to enter costs for private mortgage insurance (PMI) and homeowners' association dues, if applicable. These details result in a more accurate monthly payment estimate than if you simply calculated your mortgage principal and interest.\n\nThere are two main advantages to a 30-year fixed mortgage: Your payments are lower, and your monthly payments are predictable.\n\nA 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has relatively low monthly payments because you’re spreading your repayment out over a longer period of time than with, say, a 15-year mortgage. Your payments are predictable because, unlike with an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), your rate isn’t going to change from year to year. Most years, the only things that might affect your monthly payment are any changes to your homeowners insurance or property taxes.\n\nThe main disadvantage of 30-year fixed mortgage rates is the mortgage interest, both in the short and long term.\n\nA 30-year fixed term comes with a higher rate than a shorter fixed term, and it’s higher than the intro rate to a 30-year ARM. The higher your rate, the higher your monthly payment. You’ll also pay much \n\nThe pros and cons of 15-year fixed mortgage rates are basically swapped with those of the 30-year rates. Yes, your monthly payments will still be predictable, but another advantage is that shorter terms come with lower interest rates. Not to mention, you’ll pay off your mortgage 15 years sooner. So you’ll save potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest over the course of your loan.\n\nHowever, because you’re paying off the same amount in half the time, your monthly payments will be higher than if you choose a 30-year term.\n\nDig deeper into 15-year vs. 30-year mortgages.\n\nAdjustable-rate mortgages lock in your rate for a predetermined amount of time, then change it periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years and then goes up or down once per year for the remaining 25 years.\n\nThe main advantage is that the introductory rate is usually lower than what you’ll get with a 30-year fixed rate, so your monthly payments will be lower. (Current average rates don't necessarily reflect this, though — in some cases, fixed rates are actually lower. Talk to your lender before deciding between a fixed or adjustable rate.)\n\nWith an ARM, you have no idea what mortgage rates will be like once the intro-rate period ends, so you risk your rate increasing later. This could ultimately end up costing more, and your monthly payments are unpredictable from year to year.\n\nBut if you plan to move before the intro-rate period is over, you could reap the benefits of a low rate without risking a rate increase down the road.\n\nLearn whether now is a good time to get an adjustable-rate mortgage.\n\nFirst of all, now is a relatively good time to buy a house compared to a couple of years ago. Home prices aren't spiking like they were during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. So, if you want or need to buy a house soon, you should feel pretty good about the current housing market.\n\nThe best time to buy is typically whenever it makes sense for your stage of life. Trying to time the real estate market can be as futile as timing the stock market — buy when it's the right time for you.\n\nWhich is more important, your home price or mortgage rate?\n\nAccording to Zillow, the national average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.01% right now. Why are Zillow's rates usually lower than those reported by Freddie Mac and elsewhere? Each source compiles rates by different methods. Zillow gets rates from its lender marketplace and Freddie Mac pulls information from loan applications submitted to its underwriting system. Mortgage rates vary by state and even ZIP code, by lender, loan type, and many other factors. That's why it's so important to shop multiple mortgage lenders.\n\nAre interest rates expected to go down?\n\nNot much. According to its December forecast, the MBA expects the 30-year mortgage rate to be near 6.4% through 2026. Fannie Mae also predicts a 30-year rate above 6% through next year, yet dipping down to 5.9% in Q4 2026.\n\nOverall, mortgage rates have dropped gradually since the end of May. The 30-year fixed rate topped out over 7% in January, then bounced higher and lower for months. On May 29, the 30-year rate was 6.89%, and began slowly moving down.\n\nIn many ways, securing a low mortgage refinance rate is similar to when you bought your home. Try to improve your credit score and lower your debt-to-income ratio (DTI). Refinancing into a shorter term will also land you a lower rate, though your monthly mortgage payments will be higher.\n\nTo refinance your mortgage, you need a certain amount of home equity. The rules vary by loan type and refi program. Learn how much equity you need to refinance.\n\nThe best mortgage refinance companies charge low interest rates and fees, and they often have unique perks for customers. Find your best mortgage refinance lender.\n\nIf you want to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025, you're in luck. It may be a good time. Learn the steps to take to refi in the next couple of months.\n\nMortgage rates are down, so refinancing soon could be a good idea. Learn what to know and how to prepare for refinancing your mortgage at the beginning of 2026.\n\nA mortgage refinance can cost 2% to 6% of the loan amount. Learn what impacts these costs and how to lower or eliminate what you pay up front.\n\nChase Home Loans is offering a \"refinancing rate sale\" for rate-and-term and cash-out refinancing.

    "fullText": "Hours after a dramatic military operation ousted Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro from power and removed him from the country Saturday, President Donald Trump said the United States would “run” Venezuela at least temporarily and tap its vast oil reserves to sell to other nations.\n\nU.S. operations on Saturday represented America’s most assertive action to achieve regime change in a country since the nation’s 2003 invasion of Iraq. The actions raise stark new questions about the legality of the U.S. moves under a broader campaign against the South American nation.\n\nThe middle-of-the-night seizure of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, who were being transported on a U.S. warship to face narco-terrorism conspiracy charges in New York, is beyond even the most high-profile historical examples of aggressive American actions toward autocratic governments in Panama, Iraq and beyond, legal experts said. It came after a surprise U.S. incursion into the Venezuelan capital, rocked with overnight explosions early Saturday.\n\nThe Trump administration described the operation — and earlier deadly strikes on boats in the Caribbean Sea — as necessary to stem the flow of dangerous drugs.\n\nProtesters gather in Los Angeles, elsewhere to protest US military action\n\nHundreds gathered in the rain in downtown Los Angeles to protest the U.S. military action in Venezuela.\n\nPeople donning raincoats and holding umbrellas carried signs saying “Stop bombing Venezuela now!” and “No blood for oil” as they listened to speakers. One person held a handwritten sign saying “No War! No Trump!”\n\nA smaller group of about 50 people protested in Las Vegas.\n\nAftermath of US military operation in Venezuela disrupts Caribbean travel\n\nThe U.S. military operation that captured Maduro and flew him out of the country has also disrupted Caribbean travel at a busy travel time for the region.\n\nElisia Cohen had planned to return from her family vacation in Puerto Rico on Friday but a mechanical issue grounded their Delta flight back to Minneapolis. Then, the University of Minnesota professor woke up before dawn Saturday to the news of the strikes on Venezuela and the delay, then cancellations of all flights.\n\n“I hope this will not become a nightmare of airspace not opening up,” she said.\n\nShe spent most of Saturday trying to rebook a flight back to anywhere in the continental United States, and even though she succeeded, she said she won’t truly stop worrying until the airspace reopens and flights start taking off again.\n\nU.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a social media post that “the FAA restricted the airspace in the Caribbean and Venezuela to ensure the SAFETY of the flying public.”\n\n“When appropriate, these airspace restrictions will be lifted,” he said. “Please work with your airlines directly if your flight has been impacted.”\n\n▶ Read more about travel disruptions here\n\nVenezuelans wonder who’s in charge as Trump claims contact with Maduro’s deputy Rodríguez\n\nUncertainty gripped Venezuela on Saturday as people scrambled to understand who was in charge of the South American country.\n\nTrump delivered a shocking pick for who would take control: The United States, perhaps in coordination with one of Maduro’s most trusted aides.\n\nDelcy Rodríguez has served as Maduro’s vice president since 2018, overseeing much of Venezuela’s oil-dependent economy as well as its feared intelligence service. But she is someone the Trump administration apparently is willing to work with, at least for now.\n\n“She’s essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again,” Trump told reporters of Rodríguez, who faced U.S. sanctions during Trump’s first administration for her role in undermining Venezuelan democracy.\n\nTrump indicated that Rodríguez had been sworn in already as president of Venezuela, per the transfer of power outlined in the constitution. However, state television has not broadcast any swearing-in ceremony.\n\nIn her televised address, Rodríguez did not declare herself acting president or mention a political transition. A ticker at the bottom of the screen identified her as the vice president. She gave no sign that she would be cooperating with the U.S.\n\n“What is being done to Venezuela is an atrocity that violates international law,” she said. “History and justice will make the extremists who promoted this armed aggression pay.”\n\n▶ Read more about the reaction within Venezuela\n\nMaduro’s ouster sparks celebrations among Venezuelans in South Florida\n\nRevelers chanted “liberty” and draped Venezuelan flags over their shoulders in South Florida to celebrate Maduro’s capture and removal from the country.\n\nFor some Venezuelan natives, the military action — culminating months of stepped-up U.S. pressure — brought their dreams of reuniting with loved ones closer to reality after years of heartbreaking separations.\n\nPeople gathered for a rally in Doral, the Miami suburb where Trump has a golf resort and where roughly half the population is of Venezuelan descent.\n\nOutside El Arepazo restaurant, a hub of the Venezuelan culture of Doral, one man held a piece of cardboard with “Libertad” scrawled with a black marker. It was a sentiment expressed by others hoping for a new beginning for their home country as they chanted “Liberty! Liberty! Liberty!”\n\n“We’re like everybody — it’s a combination of feelings, of course,” said Alejandra Arrieta, who came to the U.S. in 1997. “There’s fears. There’s excitement. There’s so many years that we’ve been waiting for this. Something had to happen in Venezuela. We all need the freedom.”\n\nBlack lawmakers in Congress condemn ‘illegal’ US actions in Venezuela\n\nThe Congressional Black Caucus is blasting Trump over U.S. actions against Maduro, calling the operation “a grave and illegal abuse of power.”\n\n“While Nicolás Maduro is, in fact, an illegitimate leader, the deployment of U.S. military power to impose political change in a sovereign nation — without the consent of Congress or a clear and defined plan of action — threatens to draw the United States into an indefinite conflict in Venezuela,” the caucus said in statement.\n\n“We cannot understate the severity of the consequences that could follow from such reckless actions, which threaten regional stability and weaken our standing on the world stage,” the lawmakers said.\n\nPerson in custody seen gingerly leaving plane believed to be carrying Maduro\n\nAt around 5:25 p.m., a person in custody was escorted out of the plane believed to be carrying Maduro.\n\nThe person gingerly made his way down a stairway one step at a time, then was led across the tarmac surrounded by a crowd of at least three dozen federal agents.\n\nSeveral agents in the crowd appeared to film the person on their phones.\n\nCanadian PM stands by Venezuelan people’s sovereign right to build future\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney says his government welcomes the opportunity for freedom, democracy and prosperity for the Venezuelan people.\n\nCarney notes in a post on a social media that Canada has not recognized the “illegitimate regime of Maduro since it stole the 2018 election.” He says Canada has long supported a “Venezuelan-led transition process that respects the democratic will of the Venezuelan people.”\n\nCarney is calling on all parties to respect international law and says Canada stands by the “Venezuelan people’s sovereign right to decide and build their own future.”\n\nSeizing control of Venezuela’s oil presents legal issues for US, law professor says\n\nMatthew Waxman, a Columbia University law professor who was a national security official in the George W. Bush administration, said seizing control of Venezuela’s resources opens up additional legal issues.\n\n“For example, a big issue will be who really owns Venezuela’s oil?” Waxman wrote in an email. “An occupying military power can’t enrich itself by taking another state’s resources, but the Trump administration will probably claim that the Venezuelan government never rightfully held them.”\n\nBut Waxman, who served in the State and Defense departments and on the National Security Council under Bush, noted that “we’ve seen the administration talk very dismissively about international law when it comes to Venezuela.”\n\nJUST IN: Plane carrying deposed Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro arrives in New York following his capture by US, AP source says German leader calls for stability in Venezuela\n\nChancellor Friedrich Merz said in a statement Saturday that Nicolás Maduro led Venezuela to disaster and noted that Germany, like many other countries, didn’t recognize his presidency after the South American nation’s last election.\n\nMerz said that a legal classification of the U.S. intervention is “complex” and “we will take time” on the matter.\n\nHe said that political instability must not arise in Venezuela now and that it’s important to ensure “an orderly transition to a government legitimized by elections.”\n\nSchumer says Trump actions in Venezuela ‘reckless’\n\nThe Senate Democratic leader said, “The idea that Trump plans to now run Venezuela should strike fear in the hearts of all Americans.”\n\nSen. Chuck Schumer of New York said the Trump administration had assured him multiple times it was not pursuing regime change or taking military action in Venezuela.\n\n“Clearly, they are not being straight with Americans,” he said.\n\nRubio hints Cuba could be next after Trump takes Maduro out of Venezuela\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio is hinting that Cuba could be the next target of the Trump administration’s push to restore American dominance in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nRubio said he would be a bit concerned if he were a Cuban government official following the overnight U.S. military operation in Venezuela that captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife. “If I lived in Havana and I was in the government, I’d be concerned at least a little bit,” said Rubio, who has had a long preoccupation with both Venezuela and Cuba.\n\nThe U.S. has had a long history of military interventions in Latin America, including its tacit support for the unsuccessful 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion led by Cuban exiles aimed at toppling Fidel Castro.\n\nVenezuela's UN ambassador says his country has right to self defense\n\nIn a letter sent to the U.N. Security Council on Saturday, the Venezuelan ambassador to the U.N. warned that in light of the U.S. strikes, the country “reserves the inherent right to self defense.”\n\nThe letter from Ambassador Samuel Reinaldo Moncada Acosta, obtained by AP, goes on to request an urgent meeting of the 15-member council and condemnation and cessation of U.S. actions.\n\n“What began more than four months ago as a police fantasy is now showing its true face: this is a colonial war aimed at destroying our republican form of government, freely chosen by our people, and at imposing a puppet government that allows the plundering of our natural resources, including the world’s largest oil reserves,” Acosta wrote.\n\nTrump says Venezuelan vice president Delcy Rodríguez sworn in as president\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump claimed that Venezuelan vice president Delcy Rodríguez had been sworn in as president shortly before he spoke to reporters and added she had spoken with Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\n“She is essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again. Very simple,” Trump said.\n\nEarlier, opposition leader María Corina Machado said that the opposition candidate Edmundo González should assume power, saying that he rightfully won the 2024 presidential election.\n\nTrump shares photo of captured Maduro\n\nThe president posted a photo on social media showing Maduro wearing a sweatsuit and a blindfold with the caption: “Nicolas Maduro on board the USS Iwo Jima.”\n\nMaduro appeared to be wearing a flotation device around his neck. Next to him was someone wearing a jacket that had a DEA logo.\n\nMaduro also had protective headphones on his ears and appeared to be lifting a water bottle with both arms to drink.\n\nTrump’s action against Maduro contrasts with clemency granted to ex-Honduras leader\n\nTrump’s dramatic action against Maduro is the polar opposite of the clemency he granted to former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández.\n\nTrump in December pardoned Hernández though he was sentenced to 45 years in U.S. prison for helping drug traffickers to safely move hundreds of tons of cocaine north through his country to the U.S.\n\nHernández, who enjoyed support from officials in the first Trump administration, was convicted by a U.S. jury in New York — which Maduro is now set to face.\n\nWhen asked in an interview with Politico about the pardon, Trump said, “I don’t know him” and “I know very little about him,” but added that he was told that Hernández “was set up.”\n\n“The country, uh, deals in drugs, like probably you could say that about every country, and because he was the president, they gave him like 45 years in prison,” he said.\n\nJustice Department released a new indictment of Maduro and wife\n\nThe indictment accuses Maduro of leading a “a corrupt, illegitimate government that, for decades, has leveraged government power to protect and promote illegal activity, including drug trafficking.” It alleges that the drug trafficking efforts “enriched and entrenched Venezuela’s political and military elite.”\n\nU.S. authorities allege that Maduro partnered with “some of the most violent and prolific drug traffickers and narco-terrorists in the world” to bring tons of cocaine into the U.S., according to the indictment.\n\nAuthorities estimate that as much as 250 tons of cocaine were trafficked through Venezuela by 2020, according to the indictment. The drugs were moved on go-fast vessels, fishing boats and container ships or via planes from clandestine airstrips, authorities allege.\n\nUN is ‘deeply alarmed’ by the US strike\n\nThe United Nations said it was “deeply alarmed” by the U.S. strikes and reported detention of President Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela. It expressed concern that the escalation was a violation of international law.\n\n“These developments constitute a dangerous precedent,” Stéphane Dujarric, spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general, said in a statement. Dujarric said the U.N. worried about the larger implications for Latin America and the Caribbean and called on “all actors in Venezuela” to respect human rights and the rule of law.\n\nChina slams US strike in Venezuela\n\nChina strongly condemned the U.S. strike in Venezuela and the action against its president, the Foreign Ministry said, adding the Beijing government was “deeply shocked” and firmly opposed to the operation.\n\n“Such hegemonic acts of the U.S. seriously violate international law and Venezuela’s sovereignty and threaten peace and security in Latin America and the Caribbean region,” it said.\n\nIt called on the U.S. to comply with international law and the principles of the U.N. Charter, urging it to stop violating the sovereignty and security of other nations.\n\nTrump says a helicopter was hit and ‘a few’ US members were injured in Venezuela\n\nTrump said a helicopter was hit during the operation in Venezuela and a few U.S. members were injured, but he believed none were killed.\n\n“A couple of guys were hit, but they came back and they’re supposed to be in pretty good shape,” he said.\n\nHe said the U.S. lost no aircraft in the operation.\n\n“We got it all back. One of them was hit pretty hard but—a helicopter—but we got it back.\n\n“We had to do it because it’s a war,” he added a few moments later.\n\nTrump dismisses criticism he did not seek congressional permission for Venezuela strike\n\nTrump brushed off criticism from U.S. Democratic lawmakers that he did not seek permission from Congress ahead of time and that the strike was illegal. He called his Democratic critics “weak, stupid people” and blaming his political opponents for inflation in the U.S.\n\nHe said the operation in Venezuela was “really genius.”\n\n“All they do is complain,” he said of the Democrats.\n\n“They should say, ‘Great job.’ They shouldn’t say, ‘Oh Gee, maybe it’s not constitutional.’ You know, the same old stuff that we’ve been hearing for years and years and years,” Trump said.\n\nTrump says he proposed to the Mexican president that US take out cartels\n\nTrump said the operation in Venezuela “wasn’t meant to be” a message to Mexico, but then he has proposed to Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum that the U.S. “take out” cartels in her country and suggested the U.S. might take action.\n\n“We’re very friendly with her, she’s a good woman. But the cartels are running Mexico. She’s not running Mexico. The cartels are running Mexico,” Trump said.\n\nHe said he’s asked Sheinbaum numerous times, “Would you like us to take out the cartels?” but she has said no.\n\n“Something’s going to have to be done with Mexico,” Trump said.\n\nTrump says US will decide on what’s next for Venezuela\n\nPresident Donald Trump said in an interview Saturday morning that the United States will be making decisions on what is next for Venezuela after capturing the Latin American country’s president and flying him out of the country.\n\n“We’ll be involved in it very much” as to who will govern the country, Trump said.\n\n“We can’t take a chance in letting somebody else run and just take over what he left, or left off,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News hours after the capture.\n\nMaduro was at his home when he was seized in US operation, party leader tells AP\n\nVenezuelan ruling party leader Nahum Fernández told The Associated Press that Nicolás Maduro and his wife were at their home within the Ft. Tiuna military installation when they were captured.\n\n“That’s where they bombed,” he said. “And, there, they carried out what we could call a kidnapping of the president and the first lady of the country.”\n\nEuropean leaders react to Maduro’s capture by the US\n\n— EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas wrote on X that she had spoken with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the EU ambassador in Caracas. “The EU has repeatedly stated that Mr Maduro lacks legitimacy and has defended a peaceful transition. Under all circumstances, the principles of international law and the UN Charter must be respected. We call for restraint.”\n\n— Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez called for “de-escalation and responsibility. International Law and the principles of the United Nations Charter must be respected,” Sánchez wrote on X.\n\n— Russia’s Foreign Ministry said it is “extremely alarmed” and called for “immediate clarification,” according to a statement posted Saturday on the ministry’s Telegram channel. The ministry said such actions, if confirmed, would constitute “an unacceptable infringement on the sovereignty of an independent state.”\n\n— British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the U.K. was not involved in the U.S. operation in Venezuela and that he would seek more information from Trump. Without condemning the U.S. action, Starmer said he always believes that international law should be upheld. “But I think at this stage, fast moving situation, let’s establish the facts and take it from there,” he said.\n\nUS indicted Maduro on narcoterrorism charges in 2020\n\nThe Justice Department during Trump’s first term in office charged in the several indictments that Maduro had effectively converted Venezuela into a criminal enterprise at the service of drug traffickers and terrorist groups as he and his allies stole billions from the South American country.\n\nThe coordinated unsealing of indictments against 14 officials and government-connected individuals, and rewards of $55 million for Maduro and four others, attacked all the key planks of what then-Attorney General William Barr called the “corrupt Venezuelan regime,” including the Maduro-dominated judiciary and the powerful armed forces.\n\nOne indictment by prosecutors in New York accused Maduro and socialist party boss Diosdado Cabello, head of the rubber-stamping constitutional assembly, of conspiring with Colombian rebels and members of the military “to flood the United States with cocaine” and use the drug trade as a “weapon against America.”\n\nRead our news report from 2020 on the charges\n\nRussia calls US action ‘an act of armed aggression’\n\nRussia’s Foreign Ministry condemned what it called a U.S. “act of armed aggression” against Venezuela in a statement posted on its Telegram channel Saturday.\n\n“Venezuela must be guaranteed the right to determine its own destiny without any destructive, let alone military, outside intervention,” the statement said.\n\nThe ministry called for dialogue to prevent further escalation and said it reaffirmed its “solidarity” with the Venezuelan people and government, adding that Russia supports calls for an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting.",

    "description": "Widening protests in Iran sparked by the Islamic Republic's ailing economy are putting new pressure on its theocracy.  Tehran is still reeling from a 12-day war launched by Israel in June that saw the United States bomb nuclear sites in Iran.  Economic pressure, intensified in September by the return of United Nations sanctions on the country over its atomic program, has put Iran's rial currency into a free fall, now trading at some 1.4 million to $1.",
    "fullText": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Widening protests in Iran sparked by the Islamic Republic's ailing economy are putting new pressure on its theocracy.\n\nTehran is still reeling from a 12-day war launched by Israel in June that saw the United States bomb nuclear sites in Iran. Economic pressure, intensified in September by the return of United Nations sanctions on the country over its atomic program, has put Iran's rial currency into a free fall, now trading at some 1.4 million to $1.\n\nMeanwhile, Iran's self-described “Axis of Resistance” — a coalition of countries and militant groups backed by Tehran — has been decimated in the years since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in 2023.\n\nA new threat by U.S. President Donald Trump warning Iran that if Tehran “violently kills peaceful protesters,” the U.S. “will come to their rescue\" has taken on new meaning after American troops captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, a longtime ally of Tehran.\n\nHere's what to know about the protests and the challenges facing Iran's government.\n\nHow widespread the protests are\n\nDemonstrations have reached over 170 locations in 25 of Iran’s 31 provinces, the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency reported early Sunday. The death toll had reached at least 15 killed, it added, with more than 580 arrests. The group, which relies on an activist network inside of Iran for its reporting, has been accurate in past unrest.\n\nUnderstanding the scale of the protests has been difficult. Iranian state media has provided little information about the demonstrations. Online videos offer only brief, shaky glimpses of people in the streets or the sound of gunfire. Journalists in general in Iran also face limits on reporting such as requiring permission to travel around the country, as well as the threat of harassment or arrest by authorities.\n\nBut the protests do not appear to be stopping, even after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Saturday said “rioters must be put in their place.”\n\nThe collapse of the rial has led to a widening economic crisis in Iran. Prices are up on meat, rice and other staples of the Iranian dinner table. The nation has been struggling with an annual inflation rate of some 40%.\n\nIn December, Iran introduced a new pricing tier for its nationally subsidized gasoline, raising the price of some of the world’s cheapest gas and further pressuring the population. Tehran may seek steeper price increases in the future, as the government now will review prices every three months.\n\nThe protests began first with merchants in Tehran before spreading. While initially focused on economic issues, the demonstrations soon saw protesters chanting anti-government statements as well. Anger has been simmering over the years, particularly after the 2022 death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody that triggered nationwide demonstrations.\n\nIran's “Axis of Resistance,\" which grew in prominence in the years after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq, is reeling.\n\nIsrael has crushed Hamas in the devastating war in the Gaza Strip. Hezbollah, the Shiite militant group in Lebanon, has seen its top leadership killed by Israel and has been struggling since. A lightning offensive in December 2024 overthrew Iran’s longtime stalwart ally and client in Syria, President Bashar Assad, after years of war there. Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi rebels also have been pounded by Israeli and U.S. airstrikes.\n\nChina meanwhile has remained a major buyer of Iranian crude oil, but hasn't provided overt military support. Neither has Russia, which has relied on Iranian drones in its war on Ukraine.\n\nThe West worries about Iran’s nuclear program\n\nIran has insisted for decades that its nuclear program is peaceful. However, its officials have increasingly threatened to pursue a nuclear weapon. Iran had been enriching uranium to near weapons-grade levels prior to the U.S. attack in June, making it the only country in the world without a nuclear weapons program to do so.\n\nTehran also increasingly cut back its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, as tensions increased over its nuclear program in recent years. The IAEA's director-general has warned Iran could build as many as 10 nuclear bombs, should it decide to weaponize its program.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies have assessed that Iran has yet to begin a weapons program, but has “undertaken activities that better position it to produce a nuclear device, if it chooses to do so.”\n\nIran recently said it was no longer enriching uranium at any site in the country, trying to signal to the West that it remains open to potential negotiations over its atomic program to ease sanctions. But there's been no significant talks in the months since the June war.\n\nWhy relations between Iran and the US are so tense\n\nIran decades ago was one of the United States’ top allies in the Mideast under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who purchased American military weapons and allowed CIA technicians to run secret listening posts monitoring the neighboring Soviet Union. The CIA fomented a 1953 coup that cemented the shah’s rule.\n\nBut in January 1979, the shah, fatally ill with cancer, fled Iran as mass demonstrations swelled against his rule. Then came the Islamic Revolution led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, which created Iran’s theocratic government.\n\nLater that year, university students overran the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, seeking the shah’s extradition and sparking the 444-day hostage crisis that saw diplomatic relations between Iran and the U.S. severed.\n\nDuring the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s, the U.S. backed Saddam Hussein. During that conflict, the U.S. launched a one-day assault that crippled Iran at sea as part of the so-called “Tanker War,” and later shot down an Iranian commercial airliner that the U.S. military said it mistook for a warplane.\n\nIran and the U.S. have seesawed between enmity and grudging diplomacy in the years since, and relations peaked with the 2015 nuclear deal, which saw Iran greatly limit its program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. But Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the accord in 2018, sparking tensions in the Mideast that intensified after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.",

    "fullText": "Tommy Lee Jones' daughter Victoria had a plea deal that demanded sobriety waiting to be signed ahead of her sudden death ... TMZ has learned.\n\nAs you know, she was found deceased at Fairmont San Francisco early Thursday morning, with the dispatch audio indicating it may be related to an overdose. We also told you she had multiple run-ins with the law over the years ... with a recent drug-related arrest in April.\n\nAnd, according to court docs obtained by TMZ ... Victoria was offered a plea deal following the April incident, during which she was found to be in unlawful possession of cocaine -- and resisted arrest. The plea deal Napa County had offered would require her to plead guilty to resisting/obstructing arrest and possessing a controlled substance ... but would free her of the charge against her of being under the influence of a controlled substance. In return, she'd have to refrain from using drugs and submit to random testing.\n\nThis deal would have required her to be on probation for a year ... as well as attend an alternative program such as counseling. She would have also been responsible for paying for the program as well as the fines associated with her charges.\n\nVictoria's next court date was January 20, where she may have entered a plea for the case. However, she did not make it to the date.\n\nTMZ reached out to Victoria's attorney and the Napa County prosecutor for comment ... so far, no word back.\n\nAs we told you, the charges resulted from a welfare check at Victoria's location after she accidentally dialed police in Napa. She told authorities she was fine, but while there, they noticed a white residue on her tongue and that she had rapid speech and was \"fighting with her body movements.\" She admitted to using cocaine that day, and police arrested her -- which she resisted.\n\nVictoria's family broke their silence on her death Friday with a brief statement that read ... \"We appreciate all of the kind words, thoughts, and prayers. Please respect our privacy during this difficult time. Thank you.\"",

    "fullText": "The New York Jets will play their Week 18 finale versus the Buffalo Bills on Sunday.\n\nIt'll represent the last showing for a defense that must undergo a serious identity makeover in the offseason. Head coach Aaron Glenn will hire a new defensive coordinator. General manager Darren Mougey will also be tasked with acquiring more talented playmakers on defense. They are heavily outmatched heading into Sunday.\n\nUntil then, we've identified three potential X-factors for the Jets defense in Week 18.\n\nJermaine Johnson II hasn't recorded a sack in his latest six appearances. It's been tough sledding for the pass rusher who returned from a 2024 season-ending torn Achilles injury. Johnson continues playing with effort, so it would be nice to see him finish the season with a breakthrough.\n\nInterim defensive coordinator Chris Harris recently heaped praise on linebacker Jamien Sherwood. Sherwood leads the Jets in tackles by a longshot with 147 takedowns this season. Despite it being a lost season, he continues to compete to his full capabilities.\n\nVeteran defensive tackle Harrison Phillips has been a limited participant at practice this week. That indicates he's trending towards being available for Sunday's finale. The Jets need Phillips' run-stopping efforts against Josh Allen and James Cook.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jets Wire: New York Jets vs. Buffalo Bills: 3 X-factors on defense for Week 18",

    "fullText": "We’re heading into the final week of the 2025 NFL season, and the Rams won’t know where they stand for the postseason until we get to the other side of it.\n\nAs of right now, the Rams are slotted in at the No. 6 Wild Card spot, but things could shift depending on how Saturday’s late game between the Seahawks and 49ers shakes out. If the Seahawks win on Saturday, and the Rams beat the Cardinals on Sunday, then LA can wrap up the fifth seed. That would involve traveling to face the four-seed, which will be the NFC South winner. The Buccaneers are penciled into that spot right now after Saturday afternoon’s win over the Panthers, but they now need the Falcons to lose to the Saints on Sunday to cement their NFC South win.\n\nIf the Rams lose and the 49ers win, the Rams will stay in the sixth seed. In that case, they’ll play either the Eagles or the Bears to kick off the postseason, and I think it goes without saying that the 5-seed is the better option here.\n\nHere are the updated standings before Saturday’s games kick off in Week 18.\n\n1. Seattle Seahawks (13-3) – Clinched playoff spot\n2. Chicago Bears (11-5) – Clinched NFC North\n3. Philadelphia Eagles (11-5) – Clinched NFC East\n4. Carolina Panthers (8-8)\n5.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWe haven't seen San Francisco 49ers star linebacker Fred Warner on a football field in quite some time.\n\nThat's because Warner suffered a broken and dislocated ankle back in Week 6 that was supposed to completely end his season.\n\nHowever, there is renewed hope that Warner will make it back during the playoffs, although the Niners are going to have to win at least a game or two for that to be a possibility.\n\nYes, there is a chance Warner will play in the postseason.\n\nBut for that to even be a possibility, the Niners will have to make it to the NFC Championship Game or Super Bowl, as NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported.\n\nRapoport does add, however, that Warner would likely be limited if he does make it back during the playoffs, and he's more likely to be back by the Super Bowl rather than the NFC title game.\n\n\"Sources informed of Warner's situation say there is a chance that Warner's rehab could be going well enough for him to make a cameo in the NFC Championship Game if San Francisco is a participant or more likely Super Bowl LX, should it win the conference title,\" Rapoport and Garafolo wrote. \"And even then, it would likely be in spot duty. Any early return might put him at risk of further injury.\"\n\nEven if Warner is just limited upon his return, simply having him in uniform would provide a huge jolt to the 49ers at the most crucial moment of the season.\n\nMaxx Crosby trade rumor should have Eagles, Cowboys, Lions paying attention\n\nVikings' rumor J.J.

Another outstanding performance from Rashaun Agee helped send the Tigers back to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, with their first loss of conference play, as the graduate forward secured a double-double by leading the team with 15 points and 11 rebounds in the 75-72 win over LSU.

    "description": "Before moving ahead to Ole Miss, revisiting Miami’s emphatic punch that knocked out the defending national champions.",
    "fullText": "Tonight is the 23rd anniversary of the most controversial call in college football history, and three nights ago Miami finally got its revenge.\n\nNo. 10 Miami shocked No. 2 Ohio State 24-14 in the Cotton Bowl, ending the Buckeyes’ quest to become the first repeat national champion in the 12-team playoff era, and the first since Georgia in 2021-2022 and Alabama in 2011-2012. The 9.5-point upset wasn’t just one of the biggest in the CFP era, but it was poetic justice 23 years in the making. It also set the tone on a weekend where Ohio State, Georgia, and Alabama all lost, marking a changing of the guard in college football.\n\nRedemption for the Hurricanes 23 years later. pic.twitter.com/PyBsd1o84G\n\n— Mike Kennedy (@MikeKennedyNFL) January 1, 2026\n\nAnd before moving on to a challenging Ole Miss opponent, it’s important to cherish the juxtaposition from this year’s New Year’s Eve to that night 23 years ago. In 2003, Ohio State ended Miami’s 34-game winning streak and stopped the defending champions from repeating. On Tuesday night, Miami returned the favor, stopping Ohio State’s own repeat bid with the exact same formula the Buckeyes used against them two decades ago.\n\nFor a program haunted by Terry Porter’s controversial pass interference flag in overtime of the 2003 Fiesta Bowl – the call that gave Ohio State new life and eventually a 31-24 national championship victory- this wasn’t just a win. It was redemption. It was closure. It was sweet, intoxicating revenge.\n\n“I was full of emotions,” said cornerback Keionte Scott after his 72-yard pick-six gave Miami a 14-0 lead. “I think I took a little moment to peek at the [Ohio State] sideline and look at everybody and let them know what was going on.”\n\nThe Miami Hurricanes blow away the defending champs 🌪️😱\n\nMiami shocks the No. 2 Ohio State Buckeyes in the Cotton Bowl Classic 🙌 pic.twitter.com/favaquJZHO\n\n— FOX College Football (@CFBONFOX) January 1, 2026\n\nThat sideline included this year’s Heisman finalist, Julian Sayin, who looked petrified throughout the night. That sideline included Ryan Day, who had no answer for Mario Cristobal’s trenches. And that sideline included Caden Curry, who came up with a hypothetical that Ohio State would beat Miami 9 out of 10 times if they played. A pointless hypothetical that Miami fans have been hearing throughout this postseason and one that was not at all a reality on Wednesday night.\n\nThe Canes sideline, however, included Miami legends Jimmy Johnson, Michael Irvin, and Ray Lewis – witnesses to The U’s most satisfying victory in a generation.\n\nThe parallels between these two games are almost eerie, as if college football’s karma finally came full circle after 22 years. StateOfTheU’s own, Rob Weaver, discussed them in his feature leading up to the Cotton Bowl.\n\nIn 2003, Ohio State rode an elite defense featuring future NFL stars like Mike Doss, Will Smith, AJ Hawk, and Cie Grant. That defense held Miami’s star-studded offense – Willis McGahee, Clinton Portis, Andre Johnson, Kellen Winslow Jr., and Ken Dorsey – to just 24 points in regulation, controlled the clock, and physically dominated the defending champions.\n\nIn 2025, Miami used a similar blueprint. The Hurricanes’ defense, led by a diesel front of Akheem Mesidor and All-American Rueben Bain, Jr., held Ohio State to nine yards in the first quarter and sacked freshman quarterback Julian Sayin five times. They forced turnovers, including the epic Keionte Scott pick six. They punched the Buckeyes in the mouth – time and time again – until Ohio State had nothing left, including Jakobe Thomas who made future first rounder Carnell Tate cower under the bright lights, recording just three receptions for 37 yards. Sure, Miami native Jeremiah Smith was electric but he chose to chase waterfalls while Miami continues to build something special (the grass isn’t always greener Jeremiah, and you still have eligibility to right that wrong – but that’s for another day). The haymakers Miami threw continuously throughout the night were 23 years in the making.\n\nWatch this Ohio State staffer trying to get Jeremiah Smith away from all the Miami love pic.twitter.com/ppa7SB0HNP\n\n— CaneSport Miami Hurricanes (@CaneSport) January 1, 2026\n\nThe 2002 Buckeyes had Craig Krenzel, a game manager who let the defense dominate. Miami had Carson Beck, who completed 19 of 26 passes with zero turnovers and managed the game to perfection. Clean and efficient from start to finish. Neither quarterback was spectacular but each made the plays when needed. Krenzel made a key 17-yard pass on fourth-and-14 in overtime while Beck had an enormous run on third-and-long in the fourth. Both were exactly what their teams needed.\n\nOhio State in 2003 controlled the clock and won with methodical, grinding football, outrushing the Canes 145 yards to 65 yards. Miami in 2025 rushed for 131 yards on 40 carries, with Mark Fletcher Jr. earning offensive MVP honors. When Ohio State closed to 17-14 in the fourth quarter, Miami responded with a 10-play, 70-yard drive that consumed over five minutes and ended with CharMar Brown‘s game-sealing touchdown. Flipping the script from 2003, the 2025 Miami gathered 153 rush yards to the Buckeyes’ 45.\n\nKeionte Scott is such a complete player. Over 13 TFLs this year, and this time, the elite play recognition shows up on the pick-six.\n\nMaking game-changing plays with his processing-fueled aggression.\n\n pic.twitter.com/MskHkfF3Ao\n\n— Ian Cummings (@IC_Draft) January 1, 2026\n\nIt was championship football – physical, relentless, suffocating. The kind of football Ohio State used to break Miami’s hearts in 2003. The kind of football Miami used to break Ohio State’s dynasty dreams in 2025.\n\nThe Hurricanes didn’t just beat Ohio State. They beat them the way Ohio State beat Miami in 2003, by punching them in the mouth until the defending champions crumbled.\n\nUnderstanding what makes this victory so sweet requires understanding what was stolen from Miami on that January night in 2003.\n\nThe 2001 Miami team has a legitimate argument as the greatest college football team ever assembled. The 2002 squad was almost as talented, riding a 34-game winning streak into the Fiesta Bowl as 11.5-point favorites – the near 10-point spreads in each game being another parallel. The Buckeyes were defending their championship against a program that hadn’t won a title in 32 years.\n\nIf Miami had won that game – if Terry Porter’s flag had never been thrown – the trajectory of college football might have been completely different. This is a little less of a hypothetical than the malarkey that Caden Curry and Notre Dame fans (regarding their playoff omission) have been spewing. Back-to-back titles could have cemented Miami as the dynasty of the 2000s. Recruits would have kept flowing to Coral Gables. The U would have maintained its throne.\n\nInstead, the dynasty died that night. The 2003 Fiesta Bowl shaped the trajectories of both programs. Ohio State went 103-24 following that victory with multiple Big Ten titles, while Miami went 77-48 in the years after.\n\nThe Miami Hurricanes are heading to the CFP Semifinals after a huge upset win over the Ohio State Buckeyes.\n\nWHAT. A. WIN. 🏆 🙌🏻\n\n(📸 @LuFromdade) pic.twitter.com/OV1oPTXTBO\n\n— The Kevin Harlan Effect (@KevHarlanEffect) January 1, 2026\n\nUSC rose to prominence the very next season. Ohio State built their modern powerhouse on the foundation of that championship, playing in five national title games since 2003 and winning two more. Miami fell from grace almost immediately, never winning an ACC championship after joining in 2004, spending two decades trying to recapture lost glory.\n\nThe 2003 Fiesta Bowl didn’t just end Miami’s winning streak. It ended their dynasty. Ohio State built theirs on the ruins.\n\nFor 22 years, Miami fans have carried that pain. They’ve watched Willis McGahee’s knee get destroyed. They’ve replayed Ken Dorsey’s final incomplete pass. They’ve raged about Terry Porter’s delayed flag. They’ve watched Ohio State thrive while The U struggled to be relevant.\n\nTuesday night, Miami finally got to return the favor – and it felt glorious.\n\nPerhaps the most poetic detail of Miami’s revenge? The Hurricanes will face No. 6 Ole Miss in the Fiesta Bowl semifinals on January 8.\n\nThe Fiesta Bowl. Yup, Miami’s first appearance in that stadium (kinda) since the night Terry Porter’s flag changed everything. Their first time playing in Glendale, Arizona since January 3, 2003 – when they left as heartbroken runners-up, their dynasty in ruins.\n\nOne of the best reps of his career pic.twitter.com/GaRQvmmUlw\n\n— art (@canefilms) January 1, 2026\n\nNow they return as giant slayers, having just ended Ohio State’s repeat bid the same way the Buckeyes ended theirs. They return with an elite defense punching opponents in the mouth and the capability to beat anyone in the nation if they repeat what they did Wednesday. They return with legends like Jimmy Johnson, Michael Irvin, and Ray Lewis believing again. Not only those legends, but the many Hurricanes who believed in Miami during the last two decades.\n\nThey return one win away from a national championship game at Hard Rock Stadium – their home field – where they could complete the most improbable redemption story in college football history.\n\nBack in March, Michael Irvin posted about “stumping on the grave of that PASS Interference ghost.” That ghost has been exorcised. The pain has been washed away. The score has been settled. Irvin not only stomped on em, but he put that belt to ass.\n\nThis is me ⁦@OhioStateFB⁩ stumping on the grave of that PASS Interference ghost (RIP-my ass) that cheated us out of our 🙌🏾 fam (⁦@CanesFootball⁩ ) CHAMPIONSHIP !!!!THATS TWO RINGS I LOST ON BAD P.I. CALLS!!!! pic.twitter.com/L80WBjIrKs\n\n— Michael Irvin (@michaelirvin88) March 31, 2025\n\nThe symmetry is almost too perfect: Ohio State ruined Miami’s title repeat in the 2003 Fiesta Bowl. Miami ruined Ohio State’s title repeat and now returns to the Fiesta Bowl to continue their championship run. The hunter became the hunted. The wounded became the avenger. The dynasty that was stolen might just be reborn.\n\nFor Miami fans who have carried 22 years of anger, who have argued and who have wondered “what if” a thousand times – this victory means everything.\n\nIt means The U is back – not just competitive, but dangerous. Not just relevant, but feared. Not just hoping to recapture the past, but building something new while honoring what was lost. Mario Cristobal’s greatest strength – recruiting – has only been enhanced even more by proving his ability to secure quality wins and increase player development (this latter part has been on display not only with Francis Mauigoa and Bain, but also OJ Frederique, Malachi Toney, and Bryce Fitzgerald, among many other contributing underclassmen).\n\nMiami Hurricanes: Cotton Bowl Champions pic.twitter.com/H5uytB5Fh0\n\n— CFB Kings (@CFBKings) January 1, 2026\n\nOhio State came in as 9.5-point favorites, the defending national champions with dynasty aspirations. Miami punched them in the mouth for 60 minutes – the same way Ohio State punched Miami 22 years ago – and sent them home with their repeat dreams shattered.\n\nThe 2025 Hurricanes used 2003 Ohio State’s own formula against them: elite defense, game management, physical football, and relentless pressure. They beat the defending champions at their own game, in the biggest upset in CFP history, and earned a return trip to the stadium where their dynasty died.\n\nNow Miami heads back to the Fiesta Bowl – not as 11.5-point favorites defending a championship, but as 3.5-point favorites trying to complete one of the greatest revenge stories college football has ever seen, especially after stubbing their toe against the likes of Louisville and SMU during this season and nearly squandering their playoff chances. One more win in Glendale, and they’ll play for a national championship at home in Miami Gardens.\n\n“Go pick all yall homeboys up off the field” 😂😂 pic.twitter.com/skHMrpGXJF\n\n— Top Tier Miami (@TopTierCanes) January 2, 2026\n\nThe dynasty that was stolen in the 2003 Fiesta Bowl might just be resurrected in the 2025 Fiesta Bowl. The punch Ohio State threw 23 years ago finally got answered. The Canes continue their return to the promised land with their second big boy bowl in two weeks, countering the lone New Year’s Six they’ve played in the last two decades (an uninspiring 34-24 Orange Bowl loss to Wisconsin in 2017).\n\nThe pain is over. The revenge is complete. And somehow, impossibly, Miami gets to return to the scene of their greatest heartbreak to continue their championship run. The job is not finished.\n\nRegardless, as it relates to Ohio State, after 23 years of waiting it feels like justice to return to Arizona.\n\nThe Hurricanes are back. And this time, they’re the ones doing the punching. We’re onto Ole Miss.",

But Carolina holds the three-team tiebreaker over Tampa Bay if Atlanta also finishes 8-9.\n\nBefore the Buccaneers faced New Orleans in October, Mayfield accused the Saints of dirty play and said: “I do not like them.”\n\nNow, Tampa Bay’s playoff hopes hinge on the Saints beating the Falcons on the road on Sunday.\n\nThe Buccaneers were 0-8 in games where Mayfield threw an interception before overcoming his ninth pick in the last eight games.\n\nAfter McLaughlin’s 38-yard field-goal try was blocked with just over five minutes remaining, Carolina got within 16-14 on Bryce Young’s 8-yard TD pass to Jalen Coker with 2:27 left.\n\nMayfield tossed a short pass to Otton for a 20-yard gain on third-and-4 to extend Tampa Bay’s drive and run off more time. The Panthers got the ball back at their 3 with 18 seconds and no timeouts left. The game ended on a desperate series of laterals that resulted in a fumble.\n\nMayfield connected with Otton on an 18-yard TD pass for a 7-0 lead as the Bucs scored a touchdown on their opening drive for the third straight game. It was Otton’s first TD of the season.\n\nDown 10-0, the Panthers turned Christian Rozeboom’s interception into a quick score. Rozeboom returned the pick 20 yards to Tampa Bay’s 19. Young then connected with Tommy Tremble on an 8-yard TD pass to cut it to 10-7.\n\nJacob Parrish picked off Young late in the second half and the Buccaneers got a 36-yard field goal from McLaughlin to take a 13-7 halftime lead.\n\nMcLaughlin kicked a 48-yard field goal early in the fourth to extend Tampa Bay’s lead.\n\nCarolina’s Ryan Fitzgerald missed a 54-yarder short on the opening drive of the third quarter.\n\nMayfield completed his first six passes before misfiring on a cross-field, 13-yard toss to Payne Durham, who was wide open in the end zone. The Bucs settled for McLaughlin’s 29-yard field goal and a 10-0 lead.\n\nGene Deckerhoff, the voice of the Buccaneers for 37 years on radio, is retiring after the season. Six-time Pro Bowl wide receiver Mike Evans and veteran linebacker Lavonte David could have played their last game with the Buccaneers and possibly in the NFL if they choose to retire.\n\nDavid was a second-round pick in 2012, made one Pro Bowl, was a first-team All-Pro once and second team All-Pro twice.\n\nEvans, the No. 7 overall pick in 2014, had a 1,000-yard season every year of his career until this one, when he broke his clavicle in October and missed several games.\n\nPanthers: DT Bobby Brown III (head) left the game to be evaluated for a concussion.\n\nBuccaneers: LB Anthony Walker (ankle) was injured on the opening kickoff. ...

    "fullText": "After a scare earlier this week, the Seahawks aren’t down to their undrafted rookie third-string left tackle, after all.\n\nJosh Jones was the starter in place of injured Charles Cross for the third consecutive week Saturday, in pregame drills about a half hour before Seattle kicked off at the San Francisco 49ers for the NFC West title.\n\nJones had been questionable to play. He missed practices Tuesday and Wednesday with ankle and knee issues. Coach Mike Macdonald said the veteran swing tackle had gotten “banged up a little” last weekend in the Seahawks’ win at Carolina.\n\nJones began trending toward playing when he practiced on a limited basis Thursday.\n\nThe team signed rookie free agent Amari Kight from the practice squad to the active roster earlier this week, as insurance. He was backing up Jones in pregame drills Saturday.\n\nMacdonald said Friday the Seahawks believe Cross will be able to play in their first playoff game. He’s been out since he injured his hamstring on Jason Myers’ game-winning field goal on the final play Dec. 14 against Indianapolis.\n\nThere were no surprises in Seattle’s inactive players for the game Saturday.\n\nThey were quarterback Jalen Milroe, injured starting safety Coby Bryant, linebacker Jared Ivey, Cross, rookie offensive linemen Bryce Cabledue and Mason Richman and rookie tight end Nick Kallerup.\n\nTy Okada was poised to start again for Bryant, who has a knee injury. It was to be Oakada’s 11th start the season. The first nine was when safety Julian Love was out injured.",

    "description": "The Cougars scored a 83-73 win over Kansas State in Saturday’s Big 12 opener.",
    "fullText": "Prior to Saturday, Kansas State had only lost four times at home against ranked opponents in the Jerome Tang era.\n\nBut after BYU’s visit to Manhattan, Tang now has five such losses with the Wildcats.\n\nThe No. 10-ranked Cougars scored a 83-73 win over Kansas State in Saturday’s Big 12 opener, marking BYU’s first 10-game win streak since the days of Jimmer Fredette more than a decade ago.\n\n“Obviously, BYU is a terrific team, and Kevin (Young) does a great job and was very proud of our guys’ effort,” Tang told reporters postgame.\n\n“We have to continue to get better. To win or lose this game, we have to get better. We have some glaring things that are standing out, but they’re correctable. I know our guys’ heart, so I know that we will improve in the areas that we need to.”\n\nThe Wildcats were top 10 nationally in 3-point shooting team prior to Saturday, but against the Cougars they made just 3 of 21 attempts from behind the arc.\n\n“Well, they didn’t go in, you know, the ones that we took, they weren’t bad shots,” Tang said. “I thought we turned down like four or five that we should have been ready to shoot, that we weren’t ready to shoot. Some of that’s a credit to (BYU’s) length, right, those closeouts, but some of it, you know, I don’t know why we didn’t take certain shots that we’d have normally taken.\n\n“I said at one point, ‘Man, we can’t make 3s if we don’t shoot them,’ you know. That’s one of the strengths of our team, and so, you know, a lot of credit goes to BYU, because of the percentage of 3s that we took, as opposed to 2s, it’s too great. We got to look at the film and figure that out.”\n\nKansas State did force 19 total BYU turnovers, but such defensive success wasn’t enough to upset the Cougars.\n\n“We wanted to be the more aggressive team. It was great, but when you force 19 turnovers, you can’t have 17 points off (them). You need to have 27 points off of it, because there are a lot of them were live ball turnovers, and so we’ve got to capitalize,” Tang said.\n\n“I don’t think that we capitalized on that, and I thought that they controlled the pace of the game in the second half. We didn’t play fast enough. We didn’t.”\n\nBYU superstar AJ Dybantsa, once a Kansas State recruiting target, dazzled once again in his first taste of Big 12 action, scoring 24 points with eight rebounds, three assists and three steals.\n\nWith his 24 points, Dybantsa is now the country’s leading scorer at 23.1 points per game.\n\nAJ DYBANTSA vs K State \n\n24 PTS \n7 REB \n3 AST \n3 STL pic.twitter.com/ZTqK6Z20ZY\n\n— BYU Men's Basketball (@BYUMBB) January 3, 2026\n\n“You know, I’ve been watching AJ since he was in the seventh grade, and love him and his family. You know, I had a great time recruiting him,” Tang said.\n\n“I’ve watched his games this season, and he’s been one of the most efficient players, and today, he was very efficient again, you know, scoring 24 points on 15 shots.”\n\nKansas State now falls to 9-5 on the season and 0-1 in Big 12 play, with a tough road trip to No. 1 Arizona and Arizona State coming up next.\n\n“I’m hoping (our players) walk away with confidence that if that’s a top 10 team (in) the country and the team people say can win a national championship, and we didn’t play close to what we’re capable of playing, then, I mean, the ceiling is high, and so we should be really confident, excited about getting back into practice and improving them,” Tang said.",

    "fullText": "The San Francisco 49ers will wear their all-black rival jerseys tonight against the Seattle Seahawks. Brock Purdy and the offense won’t have their most dangerous wide receiver or all-everything left tackle.\n\nThe Seahawks are already stingy enough, but being short-handed at two of the most critical positions will make Kyle Shanahan, Brock Purdy, and everybody else’s job on offense much more challenging.\n\nIf there’s anybody who can devise a game plan without Trent Williams and Ricky Pearsall, it’s Shanahan. George Kittle and Christian McCaffrey will earn their paychecks tonight. McCaffrey might catch 15 passes if that’s what it takes for the offense to move the ball.\n\nHow can Robert Saleh and the 49ers defense rise to the occasion? Bryce Huff will face a backup left tackle. It would be a great time for rookies Alfred Collins and CJ West to generate pressure. That’s the best way to spook Sam Darnold, who is prone to batted passes and throwing off his backfoot when pressured up the middle.\n\nDarnold threw the ball to the Panthers on the first play of the game. They dropped it. That’s been an issue for the 49ers’ defensive backs this season. If there were ever a time to redeem themselves, it’s Week 18 with the No. 1 seed on the line.\n\nBased on warm-ups, Eric Kendricks will see some action at SAM linebacker. That makes the 49ers more athletic at the second level without sacrificing size against the run. Offensively, it looks like Demarcus Robinson will get the start in place of Pearsall.",

    "fullText": "Stanford men's basketball had its first game of the new calendar year and opened it with a shocking 80-76 win against No. 13 Louisville on Jan. 2 at Maples Pavilion in Stanford, California.\n\nIt was the biggest victory for Stanford head coach Kyle Smith, who earned his first ranked win at Stanford. It was also the first time in program history that Stanford beat Louisville.\n\nFreshman guard Ebuka Okorie led Stanford with 28 points, finishing 9-for-18 from the field and made 8-of-10 free throw attempts. Senior forward Chisom Okpara scored 17 points and notched a season-high eight rebounds, two assists, two blocks and two steals.\n\nRedshirt junior Ryan Agarwal scored 12 points, making all four of his 3-point attempts.\n\n\"Great win for the program,\" Smith said told reporters after the game. \"We needed it. Some guys made some big efforts. Obviously, Ebuka was tremendous. But you know, Ryan going 4-for-4 from 3 was very helpful.\"\n\nSmith said after watching film, with some guys getting called out for their efforts and performance, the team responded.\n\n\"They really bought in to what we're trying to do,\" Smith said. \"From the getgo I thought we were pretty competitive in trying to take away 3s from those guys. They're a really explosive offense and a good defensive team.\"\n\nOkorie has scored at least 20 points in eight games for Stanford. He is ranked No. 10 in Division I basketball in points per game, averaging 21.5.\n\nThe 6-foot-2 guard is third out of all freshmen in scoring behind Duke forward Cameron Boozer and BYU forward AJ Dybantsa.\n\n\"After watching film, I noticed I needed to be more aggressive. Whether it's getting downhill, getting my teammates involved (or) creating for myself,\" Okorie told reporters after the game. \"I feel like that's what I did today and it helped us get the win.\"\n\nStanford improves to 12-3 this season and 1-1 in the ACC. Its next game is on the road at Virginia Tech on Wednesday, Jan. 7.

    "fullText": "Baker Mayfield and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers held off Carolina 16-14 on Saturday to keep their playoff hopes alive to the bitter end of the NFL season.\n\nThe victory prevented the Panthers from locking up the NFC's last post-season berth and leaves both teams anxiously watching Sunday's results to learn which one progresses.\n\nTampa Bay edged an error-strewn, rain-soaked clash, taking an early lead and relying on cautious tactics and multiple field goals to cling on.\n\n\"We just found a way to win right there -- tough divisional opponent, and we did everything we could today,\" said Bucs' quarterback Mayfield.\n\n\"Sit back and see what happens tomorrow,\" said Mayfield, who threw for a touchdown, completing 16-of-22 attempted passes for 203 yards.\n\nDespite both teams ending the regular season with an 8-9 losing record, one of them is still guaranteed to win the historically weak NFC South division and reach the playoffs.\n\nWhether the Bucs or the Panthers advance now depends on the outcome of a clash between two teams with no hope of reaching the playoffs -- the Atlanta Falcons and the New Orleans Saints.\n\nTampa Bay, who have won the NFC South for the past four years and started this season well before imploding, will be rooting for the bottom-placed but in-form Saints.\n\nMeanwhile, Carolina must rely on inconsistent Atlanta. If the Falcons win, a three-way tie atop the NFC South at 8-9 would see the Panthers edge through on head-to-head results.\n\nTampa Bay scored on the game's opening drive, as tight end Cade Otton belatedly caught his first touchdown of the season, and the Bucs soon added a field goal.\n\nBut following an intercepted Baker Mayfield pass, a wide-open Tommy Tremble grabbed a Panthers touchdown with a clever, mazy run.\n\nWith torrential downpours hampering both sides, another interception -- this time off Carolina's Bryce Young -- set up another Bucs field goal for a 13-7 half-time lead.\n\nRain eased in the second half, but not before kicker Ryan Fitzgerald slipped to miss a 54-yard Panthers field goal attempt.\n\nNerves grew among the home crowd as Tampa Bay adopted ultra-cautious tactics to protect a slender lead.\n\nBut favorable decisions by officials -- a missed penalty, plus two pass interference calls -- helped Tampa Bay reach a 16-7 lead in the fourth quarter.\n\nAfter yet another rain-soaked Panthers fumble, and a blocked Tampa Bay field goal attempt, Jalen Coker caught an eight-yard touchdown with just over two minutes remaining to bring Carolina hope.\n\nBut the Buccaneers held on. A grinning Mayfield said he will now learn if his season will continue into the playoffs \"from my own couch.\"",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nNo matter what happens on Sunday, when the Carolina Panthers need the Atlanta Falcons to beat the New Orleans Saints in order to win the division and make the playoffs, it has been a successful rookie season for wide receiver Tetairoa McMillan.\n\nWith the Week 18 game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the books following a 16-14 loss for the Panthers, McMillan has finished his first season in the NFL with 1,000 receiving yards.\n\nMcMillan tallied a team-high 84 yards on Saturday, which leaves him with exactly 1,013 for the season.\n\nAnd, with his crossing the 1,000-yard mark, he becomes the first rookie wideout to accomplish that feat this season — and he might be the only one to do it.\n\nThe next closest rookie receiver to 1,000 yards going into Week 18 was Buccaneers wideout Emeka Egbuka, who entered Saturday's game with 930, but he only posted eight yards in the win over Carolina, so he has officially fallen short.\n\nNo other rookie wide receiver is even close to McMillan and Egbuka.\n\nDrafted with the No. 8 pick in last year's draft, McMillan has been everything the Panthers could've hoped for and looks the part of the No. 1 wideout the Panthers thought they were getting when they drafted him.\n\nAs long as he continues to move in the right direction, the future is very bright for the Arizona product.\n\nMaxx Crosby trade rumor should have Eagles, Cowboys, Lions paying attention\n\nVikings' rumor J.J. McCarthy plan puts these 5 QBs in play for MIN\n\nGiants, Titans should be intrigued by Browns head coach rumor\n\nPatriots will tie NFL record with Week 18 win over Dolphins\n\nNew Dolphins QB poached from Raiders had Tom Brady endorsement",

One name to keep an eye on is edge rusher Jordan Norman, who is slated to visit Lexington at some point, according to 247 Sports’ Chris Hummer. Colorado is also set to get a visit.\n\nA redshirt junior with two years of eligibility remaining, Norman started his career at South Alabama, committing to the program as a 3-star prospect in the 2023 recruiting class. After two seasons, appearing in all 13 games as a sophomore, he transferred to play for Jon Sumrall and Tulane this past season, where he was a difference maker.\n\nThis past season with the Green Wave, Norman recorded 28 tackles, eight tackles for loss, and six sacks. Looking at the analytics, Norman ranked third in the AAC in pressure rate (11.7%) and was a top-10 graded defensive lineman (78.5).\n\nAnnouncing his decision to enter on Friday, the opening day of the portal, there was some belief that Norman would follow Sumrall to Florida.\n\nThus far, he is only scheduling visits to Kentucky and Colorado.",

    "fullText": "Clemson defensive back Ricardo Jones plans to enter the NCAA transfer portal, according to On3’s Hayes Fawcett. Jones only spent two seasons with the Tigers after being a nice recruiting win. But Dabo Swinney will now have to replace him in the safety room, seeing some roster turnover after the season.\n\nJones wasted no time becoming an impact player for Clemson once getting to campus. He played in 12 games as a true freshman before appearing in all 13 games during the 2025 season. Twelve of those were starts.\n\nA total of 59 tackles pop up on the stat sheet over two years. Not much when it came to getting into the backfield, only having two tackles for a loss and one sack. Natural with his position, Jones was better when dropping back in coverage. Three pass breakups and nine defended passes are nice but Clemson really enjoyed the six interceptions from Jones. One of them went the other way for a touchdown in the rivalry game against South Carolina.\n\n“He is an instinctive player,” Swinney said after the rivalry win. “He loves to practice, he loves to play, he loves his teammates, he is tough as they come and he knows his limitations. He is a very smart and instinctive player… That was an incredible interception. His hands were under the ball, it was incredible. So, I am just really happy for him.”\n\nJones played high school football at Warner Robins (GA) Northside, where he was a four-star prospect. He was the No. 142 overall recruit in the 2024 cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies.",

    "description": "The Utah Mammoth show flashes of greatness, but they need to find ways to string wins together.",
    "fullText": "After a 7-2 win on Long Island on New Year’s Day, Utah Mammoth fans felt like their team could go the entirety of 2026 without losing.\n\nIt was a short-lived pipe dream.\n\nThe Mammoth lost 4-1 to the New Jersey Devils on Saturday. They’re now 0-4-0 against the Devils all-time.\n\n“Clearly not good enough,” said Mammoth defenseman Sean Durzi after the game. “... We shouldn’t be happy about that.”\n\nThe Devils are the fifth-lowest-scoring team in the NHL, and their offense is very much a group effort.\n\nGoing into the game, there was a three-way tie for their goal-scoring lead. Nobody had scored more than 11 goals all season. For context, that’s tied with the St. Louis Blues for fewest goals scored by the team’s leading scorer.\n\nThe group at the top moved up together on Saturday. Timo Meier and Nico Hischier, who were tied for the team lead, both scored, as well as Jesper Bratt and Dougie Hamilton, who aren’t far behind.\n\nThey all scored consecutively, putting Utah down 4-0 before the end of the second period.\n\nMichael Carcone spoiled Jacob Markström’s shutout with a goal just after a Mammoth power play expired, but it wasn’t nearly enough to steal a comeback win for Utah.\n\n“Puck management early in the game cost us a lot, I think,” said Mammoth head coach André Tourigny after the game. “It’s a team with a tight gap, and we tried to play in front of them and we paid for it.\n\n“And then, when we were trailing, they played good defense. We had good opportunities, but we could not bury it.”\n\nThe only consistent thing about the Mammoth this season is how consistently the word “consistency” has come up.\n\nOK, maybe that’s a bit of an exaggeration — but ever since their seven-game win streak ended in late October, they haven’t been able to win more than two games in a row.\n\nAgain, their 7-2 win against the New York Islanders on Thursday was good for morale, but it doesn’t mean much when you lose by three the next game.\n\nDurzi voiced the team’s concurrence in his postgame interview.\n\n“We’ve got to try to get on a run here,” he said. “We can’t have one good game and then one bad game. ... We’ve got to string together a lot of good ones.\n\n“Not that we haven’t been doing good things, but it’s just getting points and getting wins.”\n\nDurzi, like many of his teammates after previous losses, defended the team’s decision-makers, who have been subjects of much criticism by the fan base this season.\n\n“There’s a lot of heart in our room. There’s a lot of character. We’re wanting it. There’s no separation within the group. There’s no pointing fingers, this, that,” he said.\n\n“We’re owning it, and we know we’ve got to be better. We have the right leadership, we just have to do it — and that’s what it comes down to.\"\n\nPOSTGAME\n\n\"We're owning it. We know we got to be better. We have the right leadership. We just have to do it, and that's what it comes down to.\"@utahmammoth Sean Durzi following the Devils game pic.twitter.com/Y6LnPhmgmc\n\n— Utah Mammoth PR (@UtahMammoth_PR) January 3, 2026\n\nI was six years old when the Vancouver Canucks, my childhood team, traded Todd Bertuzzi to the Florida Panthers. I was too young to really appreciate him at the time, but I do know how much that market has yearned for a player like him ever since.\n\nBertuzzi stood at 6-foot-3 with 230 pounds of pure muscle. Most guys of that profile were pure enforcers — and he did have that side to his game — but he was also at 46-goal, 97-point player at his peak.\n\nHe bullied his way to the front of the net. Trying to stop him was like jumping in front of a train, thinking you’d knock it off-course. And if you even thought of endangering one of his teammates, well, you were lucky if you still had all your teeth when he was done with you.\n\nThe Canucks have been searching for “the next Todd Bertuzzi” ever since they let him go. It was Zack Kassian, then Jake Virtanen, then Micheal Ferland, Antoine Roussel, Vasily Podkolzin — the list goes on. They all had their moments, but none of them could quite leverage their assets to become the dominant power forward that Bertuzzi was.\n\nTruthfully, the Todd Bertuzzi archetype is an endangered species. Aside from Buffalo Sabres forward Tage Thompson, there’s no one in the league quite like him (even his nephew, Chicago Blackhawks forward Tyler Bertuzzi).\n\nBut the Mammoth have a sapling with the potential to grow into that role. His name is Daniil But.\n\nBut put his rhino-like characteristics on display against the Devils, as he has a number of times this season in both the NHL and the AHL.\n\nIn this particular instance, two minutes into the game, he intercepted the puck in the neutral zone, chipped it past the defender, took a few hard strides and powered his way to the front of the net.\n\nAside from Carcone’s goal, it was Utah’s best scoring chance of the game — and it came from nothing but hard work.\n\nBut has that Bertuzzi potential: the size, the scoring ability. His offensive numbers haven’t been there yet, but he gets as many scoring chances as anyone. The goals will come once he fully adjusts to the NHL level.\n\nThe only thing he needs to add now is the meanness. He’s a really nice person, so maybe it’s a lot to ask — but even if he can throw the occasional big hit and maybe even drop the gloves here and there, his ceiling will be much higher than 6-foot-6.\n\nUtah’s second power play unit has been great for the last few weeks. Carcone’s goal happened just after the Mammoth’s power play had expired, so it won’t count as a tally on their record, but for all intents and purposes, that’s exactly what it was.\n\nMichael Carcone nets one! pic.twitter.com/AMyyptRPg0\n\n— Utah Mammoth (@utahmammoth) January 3, 2026",

    "description": "Tampa Bay's 16-14 defeat of the Carolina Panthers means the NFC South title will be decided on the NFL regular season's final day.",
    "fullText": "The NFL runs a risk every May when its schedule comes out – hoping those “TBD” slots it reserves for the Saturday of Week 18 ultimately get filled by games worthy of the standalone broadcast windows.\n\nJan. 3 provided further proof that the league knows what it’s doing – serving up a pair of matchups with massive postseason stakes. And even then, the schedule makers got another win – the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ 16-14 defeat of the Carolina Panthers actually failing to decide the NFC South title (more on that later).\n\nThat won’t be the case Saturday night, when the San Francisco 49ers and Seattle Seahawks will definitively decide who wins the NFC West and the conference’s No. 1 overall playoff seed.\n\nBut, for now, here are the winners, losers – and otherwise – from Saturday’s games:\n\nThe Bucs and Panthers now knotted with 8-9 records, the winner of the division is still unknown. In a vacuum, Tampa Bay owns the common-games tiebreaker that puts the team in its near-perennial spot atop the division. But if the Falcons create a three-way tie by winning Sunday, Carolina would get the tiebreaker by virtue of a 3-1 mark against the Falcons and Bucs, eclipsing the other two teams.\n\nStill undefeated. The footing at Tampa's Raymond James Stadium was bad, and it was evident as players slipped, kicks were affected, and the general quality of play was impacted in such a critical game.\n\nThe home of “Monday Night Football” continues to enjoy an expanded presence late in the season, broadcasting both of Saturday’s consequential duels with another to come during the wild-card round of the playoffs. A year from now, ESPN will have the Super Bowl for the first time – though it will be simulcast on ABC. And Disney’s NFL footprint is only likely to continue growing ahead of its pending deal to acquire NFL Network, RedZone Channel and other media assets owned and controlled by the NFL, the crossover between the entities already readily apparent.\n\nHey, a team eliminated from postseason contention weeks ago now has something tangible to play for Sunday in its finale against the New Orleans Saints. Not only might a season-ending four-game winning streak save this coaching staff but knocking off the Bucs in the process would be especially sweet.\n\nThe Carolina running back, who ran for nearly 1,100 yards in 2024 for the Dallas Cowboys but was grossly undervalued by them and the free agent market has essentially matched that figure this season and earned a $1 million bonus Saturday by reaching 1,350 yards from scrimmage. Dowdle, who signed a $2.75 million contract with the Panthers before the season – and prior to hitting his incentive Saturday and others previously – should see a lot more green on the market a few months from now.\n\nIn what might have been the 14-year veteran's final game – or at least the linebacker's last one with the Bucs, his contract set to expire after the season – he recorded six stops Saturday to tie Hall of Famer Derrick Brooks as the most prolific tackler in franchise history.\n\nWith Carolina set up in the Bucs’ red zone early in the fourth quarter and trailing by nine, Dowdle slipped while tossing the ball back to QB Bryce Young on an apparent flea flicker. Fumble … and pretty much game, set and match. Tampa Bay didn't actually convert the turnover into points but did burn nearly six precious minutes off the clock before getting a field-goal try blocked. (Regardless, Dowdle still gets to keep his milli.)\n\nFUMBLE! The @Buccaneers jump on the loose ball 😤\n\nCARvsTB on ESPN/ABC\nStream on @NFLPlus and ESPN App pic.twitter.com/T7Pln5ymPn\n\nWhether it was the lateral that was prematurely blown dead − though the officials still moved the Panthers back 7 yards − or the dubious offensive pass interference against Tetairoa McMillan, which wiped out his 32-yard reception, the zebras were especially unkind to Carolina as it tried to whittle down a 13-6 halftime deficit.\n\nKicking off Saturday without injured starters – especially studs like all-universe LT Trent Williams and WR1 Ricky Pearsall – was hardly an ideal way to take on the mighty Seahawks defense with so much hanging in the balance.\n\nAll NFL news on and off the field. \n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: NFC South playoff spot up for grabs after Bucs top Panthers",

They also have wins over Memphis (by nine), Rutgers (by 16), Minnesota (by 28), and Marquette (by 20).\n\nPurdue has a well-rounded offense, averaging 86 points per game, with Trey Kaufmann-Renn and Fletcher Loyer leading the team with 14 points per game apiece. Braden Smith is averaging 12.5 points a game himself, while leading the country with 9.5 assists per game.\n\nThe Boilermakers shoot the ball efficiently (51.4 percent from the field, 39.9 percent from three), defend at a high level (66 points allowed per game, 15th in KenPom defensive efficiency), and have the resume of a top-five team.\n\nSo, it’s going to be a tough challenge for Wisconsin, which has been inconsistent, on Saturday.

    "fullText": "It’s been something you could set your watch to for the better part of five years – conversations starting about whether or not the Pittsburgh Steelers will move on from Mike Tomlin right around this time of the year. However, those conversations have largely just been speculation more than anything, with the Steelers themselves never showing any real interest in moving on from the longest-tenured head coach in major American sports.\n\nThe Steelers have been connected to multiple head coaching candidates over the last week. Albert Breer of Sports Illustrated noted that Los Angeles Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula is a name to watch for Pittsburgh.\n\n“The Steelers, Ravens and Bills have generated conversation in recent weeks,” Breer writes. “Is there any reality to it? I don’t think these would be firings. But there is some thought that Mike Tomlin could look at a reset, with the Pittsburgh roster potentially going through one soon too, and take a year or two in TV before returning to the sideline. And interestingly enough, Shula’s name has been connected to the Steelers, in case there is an opening.”\n\nAdditionally, Dianna Russini of The Athletic reports that the Steelers had internal conversations about potentially hiring Notre Dame head coach Marcus Freeman before he committed to returning to the university.\n\n“Though Freeman ultimately announced he’s staying at Notre Dame, there’s a strong belief around the league that this won’t be the last time his name is connected to NFL opportunities,” Russini writes. “The Giants, Titans and Browns all had internal discussions about Freeman, as did the Pittsburgh Steelers (in the event longtime coach Mike Tomlin decided to step away).”\n\nThis is the first time I can recall insiders going on record with names they believe could replace Tomlin – that’s not a coincidence. It’s not to say that Tomlin will 100 percent be gone in 2026, but it’s very clear that the Steelers are preparing for his departure. Things like this don’t get out by accident, and it’s certainly something to monitor in the coming weeks.\n\nBe sure to bookmark Behind the Steel Curtain for all the latest news, breakdowns, and more!\n\nRams defensive coordinator labeled Steelers potential next head coach\n\nNFL insider: Mike Tomlin is safe with Steelers regardless of result vs. Ravens\n\nSteelers top front office member potentially leaving for GM job\n\nSteelers place Darnell Washington on season-ending IR\n\nSteelers should lean more on Pat Freiermuth, Kenneth Gainwell against Ravens",

    "fullText": "The Panthers blew their chance to win the NFC South on Saturday night, which forces them to become Falcons fans for a day. If Atlanta beats New Orleans on Sunday, the Panthers will become division champs via the round-robin tiebreaker among three 8-9 teams — Carolina, Tampa Bay, and Atlanta.\n\nMany will say Carolina's opportunity was impaired by multiple officiating errors. After the 16-14 loss, coach Dave Canales steered clear of criticizing the folks in black and white.\n\n\"I don't really want to get into that because we just didn't play well enough, offensively speaking,\" Canales told reporters. \"We didn't get our run game going. A bad day on third down, which doesn't give us an opportunity to extend the drives and really have a balanced offense the way that we can play. Some missed opportunities out there. So it really just has to be on us and about the execution and all of us making sure we're, you know, in the right plays at the right time.\"\n\nThe weather impacted both teams, too, but it definitely seems as though the officiating created more issues for the road team. In the end, it won't matter if the Falcons, favored by three, can beat the Saints.\n\nThe problem for the Falcons (and for the Panthers) is that Atlanta has a 4-1 record at night, and a 3-8 record in afternoon games. On multiple occasions, they've followed a prime-time win with a clunker.\n\nThe Panthers will be praying that the Falcons get the engine running smoothly against the Saints. Carolina also will be hoping that the outcome won't be affected by the officials.\n\nUnless, of course, officiating affects the game in a way that helps the Falcons.",

    "title": "Aristotle's Rhetoric, Strunkified",
    "description": "Aristotle's Rhetoric, condensed and stylized in the spirit of Strunk & White.",
    "fullText": "Presented without commentary, save the following Editor's Note:\n\nI constructed this (with LLM assistance) because I tried to read the original text (which may be found here) and struggled over many inverted turns of phrase. This version tries to make accessible the core ideas, while preserving the exact paragraph structure of the original. I hope you find it of use.\n\nRhetoric corresponds to Dialectic. Both concern matters common to all men, not specific sciences. Thus, everyone uses both; everyone attempts to discuss, maintain, defend, and attack statements. Ordinary people do this randomly or through practice. Since both ways work, we can handle the subject systematically. We can inquire why some succeed through practice and others spontaneously. Everyone agrees that such inquiry belongs to an art.\n\nCurrent treatises on rhetoric cover only a small part of the art. Persuasion is the art's only true constituent; the rest is accessory. These writers ignore enthymemes, the substance of persuasion, and focus on non-essentials. Arousing prejudice, pity, and anger appeals to the judge, not the facts. If all trials followed the strict rules of well-governed states, these writers would be silenced. Ideally, laws should define rules, leaving little to the judge's discretion. This prevents perverting the judge with emotion—like warping a carpenter's rule. A litigant should only prove the facts: what happened or did not happen. The judge must decide on justice and importance, not take instructions from the litigants.\n\nWell-drawn laws should define nearly every point, leaving little to the judges. First, finding a few sensible legislators is easier than finding many just judges. Second, laws result from long consideration, whereas court decisions are hasty. Third, the lawgiver judges prospectively and generally; the jury decides definite, present cases. Often, friendship, hatred, or self-interest obscures the jury’s vision. Therefore, the judge should decide as little as possible. He must decide only whether something happened, since the lawgiver cannot foresee the future. Consequently, writers who theorize about the 'introduction' or 'narration' ignore the art's essentials. They only teach how to manipulate the judge's mind, not how to use enthymemes.\n\nAlthough political and forensic oratory share the same principles, and political oratory is nobler, authors focus solely on pleading in court. In political oratory, non-essentials matter less. It is less unscrupulous because it treats wider issues. The judge in a political debate decides his own interests. The speaker need only prove the facts. In forensic oratory, however, one must conciliate the listener. The judges, intent on their own satisfaction, often surrender to the disputants rather than judge them. Thus, many courts forbid irrelevant speaking; in public assemblies, the judges protect themselves.\n\nRhetoric, strictly speaking, concerns modes of persuasion. Persuasion is a form of demonstration; we are most persuaded when we consider a thing demonstrated. The rhetorical demonstration is an enthymeme, the most effective mode of persuasion. The enthymeme is a syllogism. Dialectic studies syllogisms. Therefore, he who understands the syllogism best will best understand the enthymeme, provided he knows its subject matter. The faculty that recognizes truth also recognizes probability. A man who guesses well at truth will guess well at probabilities.\n\nWe have shown that ordinary writers on rhetoric treat non-essentials and favor forensic oratory.\n\nRhetoric is useful for four reasons. First, truth and justice naturally prevail. If judgments fail, the speakers are to blame. Second, exact knowledge does not always convince an audience; we must use notions possessed by everybody. Third, we must be able to argue on opposite sides—not to deceive, but to understand the facts and confute unfair arguments. Only dialectic and rhetoric draw opposite conclusions impartially, though truth is easier to prove. Fourth, it is absurd to be ashamed of physical weakness but not of mental weakness. Rational speech is more distinctive of man than physical strength. If one argues that an unjust orator harms others, this applies to all good things except virtue—strength, health, wealth, and generalship can all be misused.\n\nRhetoric is not bound to a single subject; it is as universal as dialectic and clearly useful. Its function is not simply to persuade, but to discover the available means of persuasion in each case. In this, it resembles other arts. Medicine does not always heal, but it treats the patient as well as possible. Rhetoric discerns both the real and the apparent means of persuasion, just as dialectic discerns the real and the apparent syllogism. A 'sophist' is defined by his moral purpose, not his faculty. In rhetoric, however, 'rhetorician' may describe either the speaker's skill or his purpose. In dialectic, a 'sophist' has a specific purpose; a 'dialectician' has a specific faculty.\n\nLet us now account for the systematic principles of Rhetoric. We must define rhetoric anew.\n\nRhetoric is the faculty of observing, in any given case, the available means of persuasion. No other art shares this function. Medicine instructs on health, geometry on magnitudes, arithmetic on numbers. Rhetoric, however, observes the means of persuasion on almost any subject. Therefore, it is not concerned with any special class of subjects.\n\nSome modes of persuasion belong to the art of rhetoric; others do not. The latter—witnesses, evidence under torture, written contracts—exist beforehand. The former we construct ourselves. The one kind we use; the other we invent.\n\nSpoken persuasion has three kinds: personal character, audience emotion, and proof. Character persuades when the speech makes the speaker seem credible. We believe good men more readily, especially where certainty is impossible. This persuasion should result from the speech, not from the speaker's prior reputation. Contrary to some writers, the speaker's character is his most effective means of persuasion. Secondly, persuasion comes through the hearers when the speech stirs their emotions. Our judgments vary with our feelings—pleasure or pain, friendliness or hostility. Present-day writers focus almost exclusively on this. We will discuss this later. Thirdly, persuasion comes through the speech itself when we prove a truth or an apparent truth.\n\nTo command these three means, a man must reason logically, understand human character and goodness, and understand the emotions—their nature, causes, and excitation. Thus, rhetoric is an offshoot of dialectic and ethical (or political) studies. Rhetoric often masquerades as political science, and its professors as experts, sometimes through ignorance, sometimes through ostentation. As stated, rhetoric is a branch of dialectic. Neither is a scientific study of a separate subject; both are faculties for providing arguments.\n\nRegarding proof: as dialectic has induction and syllogism, so does rhetoric. The example is a rhetorical induction; the enthymeme is a rhetorical syllogism. Everyone uses either enthymemes or examples to prove a point. Since all proof rests on syllogism or induction (as shown in the Analytics), enthymemes must be syllogisms and examples inductions. The Topics explains the difference. Proving a proposition by similar cases is induction (dialectic) or example (rhetoric). Proving that a distinct proposition follows from certain truths is syllogism (dialectic) or enthymeme (rhetoric). Each type has advantages. Some styles rely on examples, others on enthymemes. Speeches with examples are persuasive, but those with enthymemes excite more applause. We will discuss their sources and uses later. Now let us define the processes.\n\nA statement is persuasive because it is self-evident or appears proved by other statements. In either case, it persuades someone. No art theorizes about individual cases. Medicine treats classes of patients, not just Socrates. Similarly, rhetoric deals with what seems probable to men of a given type, not just to an individual. Dialectic constructs syllogisms from materials calling for discussion; rhetoric draws from regular subjects of debate. Rhetoric deals with matters we deliberate on without systems, addressing listeners who cannot follow long chains of reasoning. We deliberate only on alternative possibilities. Nobody deliberates on the unchangeable.\n\nWe can form syllogisms from previous conclusions or from unproved but doubtful premises. The former are too long for untrained thinkers; the latter fail because their premises are not accepted.\n\nEnthymemes and examples deal mainly with the contingent. The enthymeme consists of few propositions, fewer than a normal syllogism. If a proposition is familiar, omit it; the hearer supplies it. To show Dorieus won a contest with a crown as prize, simply say, \"He won the Olympic games.\" Everyone knows the Olympic prize is a crown.\n\nFew rhetorical syllogisms rely on necessary facts. We deliberate on our actions, which are contingent, not necessary. Conclusions about the usual or possible must come from similar premises. Thus, most enthymeme propositions are usually, not necessarily, true. Enthymemes use Probabilities and Signs. A Probability is a thing that usually happens—a contingent universal. Signs relate to the statement as particular to universal or universal to particular. The infallible sign is a \"complete proof\" (tekmerion); the fallible sign has no specific name. Infallible signs form syllogisms. If a sign is irrefutable, it is a complete proof. For instance, \"He has a fever\" is an infallible sign that he is ill. A fallible sign, like \"He breathes fast\" as a sign of fever, is refutable, for one may breathe fast without fever.\n\nWe have defined Probability, Sign, and complete proof. The Analytics explains why some form syllogisms and others do not.\n\nThe 'example' is a kind of induction. It relates part to part, or like to like. When a familiar statement supports a similar one, it is an example. For instance, to show Dionysius seeks a bodyguard to become a despot, we cite Peisistratus and Theagenes, who did the same. These instances support the general principle: a man asking for a bodyguard schemes to become a despot.\n\nOne distinction in enthymemes (and dialectical syllogisms) is often overlooked. Some belong to rhetoric or dialectic; others belong to specific arts. Missing this, people fail to see that handling a subject correctly leads them away from pure rhetoric. Dialectical and rhetorical syllogisms use universal Lines of Argument (topoi) applicable to many subjects (e.g., \"the more or less\"). Special Lines of Argument apply only to specific classes (e.g., ethics or physics). General Lines of Argument increase understanding of no particular class. Special Lines of Argument, however, approach a distinct science. Most enthymemes use special Lines of Argument. We must distinguish the special from the general. Special Lines of Argument are propositions peculiar to a class; general are common to all. We begin with the special. First, let us classify rhetoric.\n\nRhetoric has three divisions, determined by the three classes of listeners. The listener determines the speech's object. He is either a judge of things past or future, or an observer. A member of the assembly decides future events; a juryman, past events; an observer decides on the orator's skill. Thus, there are three divisions of oratory: political, forensic, and ceremonial.\n\nPolitical speaking urges action or inaction. Private counsellors and public speakers always take one of these courses. Forensic speaking attacks or defends; litigants always do one or the other. Ceremonial oratory praises or censures. These three kinds refer to three different times. The political orator concerns himself with the future: he advises for or against things to be done. The litigant concerns himself with the past: he accuses or defends regarding things done. The ceremonial orator concerns himself properly with the present: he praises or blames existing conditions, though he may recall the past or guess at the future.\n\nEach kind of rhetoric has a distinct end. The political orator aims at expediency or harmfulness; he urges acceptance because it does good, or rejection because it does harm. All other points—justice, honor—are subsidiary. Litigants aim at justice or injustice; they treat other points as subsidiary. Those who praise or attack aim at honor or disgrace, treating other considerations as subsidiary.\n\nSpeakers prove these are the ends by sometimes ignoring everything else. A litigant may admit the fact or the harm, but never the injustice; otherwise, there would be no trial. Political orators often concede anything except that their course is inexpedient. They may not care if enslaving innocent neighbors is unjust. Similarly, those who praise often make a man's neglect of his own interest a ground for praise. They praise Achilles for championing Patroclus at the cost of his life; to die was noble, though to live was expedient.\n\nEvidently, the orator must command propositions on these three subjects. The propositions of Rhetoric are Complete Proofs, Probabilities, and Signs. Every syllogism is composed of propositions; the enthymeme is a syllogism composed of these specific propositions.\n\nOnly possible actions can occur in the past or present. Things that have not occurred or will not occur cannot be done. Therefore, all speakers must have propositions about the possible and the impossible, and about whether a thing has happened or will happen. Further, all men attempt to prove that good or harm, honor or disgrace, justice or injustice, is great or small. Thus, we must command propositions about greatness and smallness, both universal and particular. We must be able to say which is the greater good or the greater injustice.\n\nThese are the subjects for which we must master relevant propositions. We must now discuss each class in turn: political, ceremonial, and legal oratory.\n\nWe must first ascertain what subjects the political orator counsels on. He deals only with things that may or may not take place. No counsel is given on inevitable or impossible things. Nor do we deliberate on all possible things, such as natural or accidental events. We deliberate only on matters within our power—matters we can set going.\n\nWe will not attempt to classify these subjects accurately here. That belongs to political science, not rhetoric. Rhetoric combines logic and ethics; it resembles dialectic and sophistry. Treating rhetoric or dialectic as sciences of definite subjects destroys their nature. They are practical faculties. However, we will mention points of practical importance.\n\nPolitical speakers deliberate primarily on five matters: ways and means, war and peace, national defence, imports and exports, and legislation.\n\nRegarding Ways and Means, the speaker must know the country's revenue sources to add overlooked ones or increase defective ones. He must know all expenditures to abolish the superfluous and reduce the excessive. Men become richer by reducing expenditure as well as by increasing wealth. Experience in home affairs is insufficient; one must study the methods of other lands.\n\nRegarding Peace and War, he must know his country's actual and potential military strength, and its history of wars. He must know the same about neighboring and likely hostile countries. This allows him to maintain peace with the stronger and make war on the weaker. He must compare military powers. He should study the wars of other countries, for similar causes produce similar results.\n\nRegarding National Defence, he must know the defensive forces and the positions of forts. He must know the lie of the country. This allows him to increase or reduce garrisons and guard strategic points.\n\nRegarding Food Supply, he must know the country's needs and its home production. He must know what to export and import to negotiate treaties. He must ensure his country offends neither stronger states nor useful trading partners.\n\nAbove all, he must understand legislation, for a country's welfare depends on its laws. He must know the different constitutions, their conditions for prosperity, and their causes of destruction. Constitutions are destroyed by being pushed too far or not far enough. Democracy turns into oligarchy if pushed to excess, just as an aquiline nose becomes deformed if too aquiline. The speaker should study his country's history and the constitutions of other nations. Books of travel help with laws and customs; historical researches help with politics. These, however, belong to political science.\n\nThese are the most important kinds of information for the political speaker. We will now state the premises for arguing for or against measures regarding these matters.\n\nEvery man aims at a certain end: happiness and its constituents. This aim determines his choices. Advice concerns happiness—what creates it or destroys it. We ought to do what creates happiness and avoid what destroys it.\n\nWe may define happiness as prosperity combined with virtue, as independence, as the secure enjoyment of pleasure, or as a good condition of property and body with the power to guard and use them. Nearly everyone agrees happiness is one or more of these.\n\nThe parts of happiness are good birth, many and good friends, wealth, many and good children, a happy old age, and bodily excellences like health, beauty, strength, stature, and athletic skill. Also fame, honor, good luck, and virtue. A man with these internal (soul/body) and external (birth, friends, money, honor) goods is completely independent. He also needs resources and luck for security. Let us define these parts.\n\nGood birth in a state means indigenous or ancient members, distinguished early leaders, and many admirable descendants.\n\nGood birth in an individual means free citizenship on both sides, notable ancestors (for virtue or wealth), and many distinguished relatives.\n\n\"Many and good children\" means, for a community, numerous young men of good body (stature, beauty, strength) and soul (temperance, courage). For an individual, it means numerous children with these qualities. This includes both male and female children. Women should have bodily beauty and stature, and soul-self-command and industry. Communities, like Sparta, where women are in a bad state, spoil half of human life.\n\nWealth consists of plenty of money, land, estates, implements, livestock, and slaves. These must be secure, gentlemanly, and useful. Productive property is useful; enjoyable property is gentlemanly. Security means the power to use it; ownership means the power to dispose of it (give or sell). Wealth lies in use, not ownership.\n\nFame is respect from everybody, or from the good or wise.\n\nHonour is the token of a reputation for doing good. It is paid chiefly to benefactors, past or future. Doing good means preserving life, wealth, or other goods. Honour includes sacrifices, eulogies, privileges, land grants, front seats, state burial, statues, and public maintenance. Presents are also honours; they satisfy both the money-lover (as property) and the honour-lover (as a token).\n\nHealth is a condition allowing the use of the body while keeping free from disease. A \"healthy\" man like Herodicus, who abstains from everything to stay alive, is not truly healthy. Beauty varies with age. A young man's beauty is fitness for running and strength contests—pleasant to look at. An all-round athlete is most beautiful. A man in his prime is fit for war—pleasant yet formidable. An old man is strong enough for necessary exertion and free from deformity. Strength is the power to move others at will—by pulling, pushing, lifting, pinning, or gripping. Excellence in size means surpassing the average without losing speed. Athletic excellence combines size, strength, and swiftness. A runner moves legs fast and far; a wrestler grips; a boxer strikes. A pancratiast does both; an all-round athlete does all.\n\nA happy old age comes slowly and painlessly. It requires bodily excellence and good luck. Even a strong man suffers if diseased or unlucky. Long life is independent of health or strength, but we will not discuss that here.\n\nA friend tries to do what is good for you for your sake. He who has many such friends has \"many friends\"; if they are worthy, he has \"good friends\".\n\nGood luck is the acquisition of good things due to luck. Some are artificial, some natural (like beauty and stature). Things that excite envy usually come from luck. Luck also causes unexpected good results: you are handsome when your brothers are ugly, or you find a treasure others missed, or a missile misses you.\n\nWe will define virtue when we discuss Eulogy.\n\nWe now understand our aims in urging or deprecating proposals. The political orator aims at utility—what is useful to do. Utility is a good thing. Therefore, we must understand Goodness and Utility.\n\nA good thing is chosen for its own sake, or for the sake of something else. It is sought by all rational beings, or prescribed by reason. It brings satisfaction and self-sufficiency. It produces or maintains these states, or prevents their opposites. One thing entails another simultaneously (as health entails life) or subsequently (as learning entails knowledge). Production occurs in three ways: as being healthy produces health, as food produces it, or as exercise usually does. Both acquiring good and removing bad are good. Acquiring a greater good for a lesser, or a lesser evil for a greater, is good. Virtues are good because they put us in good condition and produce good actions. Pleasure is good because all animals aim at it. Consequently, pleasant and beautiful things are good.\n\nHere is a detailed list of good things. Happiness: desirable in itself and sufficient. Justice, courage, temperance, magnanimity, magnificence: excellences of the soul. Health, beauty, and the like: bodily excellences productive of pleasure and life. Wealth: the excellence of possession. Friends and friendship: desirable and productive. Honour and reputation: pleasant and productive. The faculty of speech and action. Good parts, strong memory, quick intuition. All sciences and arts. Life itself. Justice, as the cause of good to the community.\n\nThese are admittedly good. For disputed goods, argue thus: That is good of which the contrary is bad. That is good of which the contrary helps our enemies; if cowardice helps them, courage helps us. Generally, the contrary of what our enemies desire is valuable. (\"Surely would Priam exult.\") However, sometimes our interest coincides with our enemies', as when a common evil unites us.\n\nFurther, moderation is good; excess is bad. That on which much labor or money is spent is good; it is an end reached through means. (\"And for Priam... should they leave behind them a boast.\") Also, the proverb about breaking the pitcher at the door applies.\n\nWhat most people seek is good. \"Most people\" implies \"everybody.\" What is praised is good. Even what enemies praise is good; if they admit it, it must be evident. (Corinthians felt insulted by Simonides: \"Against the Corinthians hath Ilium no complaint.\")\n\nWhat discerning people favor is good—as Athena favored Odysseus. Generally, what men deliberately choose is good. This includes things bad for enemies or good for friends, provided they are practicable. \"Practicable\" means possible and easy. \"Easy\" means done quickly or without pain. Also good are things men wish for: either no evil or a balance of good. Things possessed exclusively, or appropriate to birth and capacity, are good. Things easily effected are good because they are practicable. Things that gratify friends or annoy enemies are good. Things chosen by those we admire, or for which we are fitted, are good. Things no worthless man can achieve bring greater praise. Finally, what we desire we consider pleasant and better. A man pursues what corresponds to his disposition: the victory-lover seeks victory; the money-lover, money. These are the sources of persuasion about Good and Utility.\n\nSince people often agree two things are useful but disagree on which is more so, we must discuss relative goodness and utility.\n\nA thing that surpasses another contains it plus something more. \"Greater\" implies comparison with \"less\"; \"great\" and \"small\" imply comparison with the normal. The great surpasses the normal; the small is surpassed by it.\n\nWe define \"good\" as desirable for its own sake, sought by all, or chosen by the wise. It produces or preserves goods. The end is the good for the sake of which else is done. Therefore, a greater number of goods is better than a smaller number, if the smaller is included. The larger contains the smaller.\n\nIf the largest member of one class surpasses the largest of another, the first class surpasses the second. If the tallest man is taller than the tallest woman, men are generally taller than women. Superiority of classes corresponds to the superiority of their largest members.\n\nIf one good always accompanies another, but not vice versa, the former is greater; it implies the use of the latter. Accompaniment is simultaneous (life with health), subsequent (knowledge with learning), or potential (cheating with sacrilege).\n\nIf two things surpass a third, the one surpassing it more is greater. What produces a greater good is itself greater. What is produced by a greater good is also greater. Health is better than pleasure because it is more wholesome.\n\nWhat is desirable in itself (like bodily strength) is better than what is merely wholesome, which is not pursued for its own sake. An end is better than a means. What needs less is more self-sufficing and therefore better. What cannot exist without a second, while the second can exist without it, is inferior to the second.\n\nA beginning or cause is a greater good than what is not. Without a cause, nothing exists. Where two causes produce consequences, the cause with more important consequences is more important. Conversely, the cause of more important consequences is itself more important. Thus, one can argue a thing is important because it is a beginning, or because it is an end. Leodamas accused Callistratus of being more guilty for prompting the deed, but Chabrias for doing it.\n\nWhat is rare is better than what is plentiful. Gold is better than iron, though less useful, because it is harder to get. Conversely, the plentiful is better because we can use it more often. \"The best of things is water.\" Generally, the hard is better than the easy because it is rarer; yet the easy is better because it is as we wish.\n\nThat is the greater good whose contrary is the greater evil, or whose loss affects us more. Positive goodness is better than the mere absence of badness. Good things have noble functions; bad things have base ones. Superiority in desirable qualities is better: keen sight is better than keen smell. Unusually great love of friends is nobler than unusually great love of money.\n\nIf it is nobler to desire a thing, that thing is nobler. The importance of the object corresponds to the importance of the instinct. If a science is valuable, so is its object.\n\nWhat the wise or the majority judge good must be so. Good is what understanding chooses; therefore, what understanding declares better is better. What better men choose is better. Courage is better than strength. Suffering wrong is better than doing wrong, for the just man chooses it.\n\nThe pleasanter thing is better, for all pursue pleasure. A pleasure unmixed with pain, or more lasting, is greater. The nobler thing is better. What we desire earnestly for ourselves or friends is a greater good; what we least desire is a greater evil. Lasting and secure things are better.\n\nCo-ordinate terms follow the same rule. If \"brave\" is better than \"temperate,\" then \"bravery\" is better than \"temperance.\" What all choose is better than what some choose. What competitors or enemies consider better is better; their judgment is impartial.\n\nSometimes we argue that what all share is better (it is a dishonour not to share); other times, what few share is better (it is rare). Praiseworthy things are better. Things with heavy penalties for absence are better.\n\nDividing things into parts makes them seem better; they seem to surpass more things. Homer lists the horrors of a captured city to rouse Meleager. Piling up facts produces a similar effect.\n\nSince hard or rare things are better, superiority due to season, age, or place is valuable. Accomplishing something beyond one's natural power or years is noble. What is natural is better than what is acquired.\n\nThe best part of a good thing is particularly good. Pericles called the loss of young men \"the spring taken out of the year.\" Things useful in pressing need (old age, sickness) are better. What leads directly to the end is better. What is possible is better than what is impossible. What is at the end of life is better.\n\nReality is better than appearance. We define appearance as what a man would not choose if it remained unknown. Thus, receiving benefits is better than conferring them, for one would choose to receive even secretly. Being is better than seeming. Men say justice is of small value because it is better to seem just than to be just; not so with health.\n\nWhat serves many purposes (life, pleasure, noble conduct) is better. Hence wealth and health are highly valued. What brings pleasure with less pain is better. What makes a better whole when added to a third thing is better. Visible possessions are better because they seem real. What is dearly prized is better; blinding a one-eyed man is worse than half-blinding a two-eyed man.\n\nWe have now set forth the grounds for arguing for or against a proposal.\n\nTo persuade audiences on public affairs, one must understand the forms of government—their customs, institutions, and interests. Men are persuaded by their interests, which lie in maintaining the established order. The supreme authority gives decisions; this authority varies with the government. There are four forms: democracy, oligarchy, aristocracy, monarchy. The supreme right to judge rests with the governing power of each.\n\nIn a democracy, citizens distribute offices by lot. In an oligarchy, they require a property qualification. In an aristocracy, they require education—specifically, education laid down by law. Those loyal to national institutions hold office; they are considered \"the best men,\" hence the name \"aristocracy.\" Monarchy is rule by one man. Kingship is limited by conditions; tyranny is unlimited.\n\nWe must notice the ends of each government, for people choose actions that lead to their ends. The end of democracy is freedom; of oligarchy, wealth; of aristocracy, the maintenance of education and institutions; of tyranny, the protection of the tyrant. We must distinguish the customs and interests that realize these ideals. Rhetorical persuasion relies on ethical as well as demonstrative argument; a speaker convinces us if we believe he possesses goodness or goodwill. Similarly, we must know the moral qualities characteristic of each government, for the character of the government provides our most effective means of persuasion. We learn these qualities from their deliberate acts of choice, which are determined by their ends.\n\nWe have considered the objects of political persuasion and the grounds for arguing utility. We have also briefly considered how to learn the moral qualities and institutions of the various governments. The Politics gives a detailed account.\n\nWe must now consider Virtue and Vice, the Noble and the Base, the objects of praise and blame. This will also help us make our own characters appear credible—our second method of persuasion. We make others trust our goodness in the same way we make them trust others'. Praise may be serious or frivolous, addressing humans, gods, inanimate things, or animals.\n\nThe Noble is both desirable for its own sake and praiseworthy, or both good and pleasant because good. If this is true, virtue is noble, being good and praiseworthy. Virtue is a faculty of providing and preserving good, or of conferring great benefits on all occasions. Its forms are justice, courage, temperance, magnificence, magnanimity, liberality, gentleness, prudence, and wisdom. The highest virtues are those most useful to others, like justice and courage. Liberality is useful because liberal men spend rather than fight for money. Justice lets men enjoy their own property legally; injustice does the opposite. Courage disposes men to noble deeds in danger; cowardice does the opposite. Temperance disposes men to obey the law regarding physical pleasures; incontinence does the opposite. Liberality spends for others; illiberality does not. Magnanimity does good on a large scale; [its opposite is meanness]. Magnificence produces greatness in spending; its opposites are smallness of spirit and meanness. Prudence is the understanding that decides wisely about happiness and goods.\n\nThis suffices for virtue and vice. Things productive of virtue are noble, as are the effects and signs of virtue. Deeds of courage are noble, as are just actions (though receiving justice is not always noble; being punished justly is shameful). Actions rewarded by honor, or done for others, or done for one's country, are noble. Actions good in themselves, not just for the individual, are noble. Noble actions include those enjoyed after death, those done for others, benefits to others, services to benefactors, and good deeds generally.\n\nThe opposites of shameful things are noble. Men are ashamed of saying or doing shameful things. As Sappho told Alcaeus: \"If your wish were noble, shame would not weigh on your eyelids.\"\n\nThings men strive for without fear are noble; they lead to fame. Qualities of naturally finer beings are noble (a man's vs. a woman's). Qualities giving pleasure to others are noble (justice). Avenging oneself is noble, for requital is just. Not surrendering is noble (courage). Victory and honor are noble, proving superiority. Memorable things are noble, especially if they last after death, are always honored, or are exceptional. Possessions bringing no profit are noble, fitting a gentleman. Distinctive customs, like long hair in Sparta, are noble. Not practicing a sordid craft is noble for a free man.\n\nTo praise or blame, identify a man's actual qualities with closely allied virtues or vices. Call the cautious man cold-blooded, the stupid man honest. Idealize the passionate man as \"outspoken,\" the arrogant as \"impressive.\" Call rashness courage, and extravagance generosity. This appeals to the audience and allows misleading inferences from motive: if a man risks danger needlessly, he will surely do so in a noble cause.\n\nConsider the audience. As Socrates said, praising Athenians to Athenians is easy. If the audience esteems a quality, attribute it to your hero. Represent everything esteemed as noble.\n\nAppropriate actions are noble—those worthy of ancestors or past career. Adding to existing honor is noble. Even inappropriate actions are noble if they surpass expectation—if an average man becomes a hero in adversity, or a successful man becomes easier to get on with. Compare Iphicrates: \"Think what I was and what I am.\"\n\nSince we praise intentional actions, prove the hero's deeds were intentional. Assert that coincidences were intended. Show a pattern of good actions to prove intent and character.\n\nPraise expresses the eminence of good qualities. Encomium refers to actual deeds. Accessories like birth and education help credibility. We bestow encomiums for deeds. Yet deeds evidence character; we praise a man if we believe he would do the deed. Calling a man blest or happy includes praise and encomium, as goodness is part of happiness.\n\nPraise is akin to urging action. Suggestions for action become encomiums when rephrased. \"A man should be proud of what he owes to himself\" becomes \"He is proud of what he owes to himself.\" To praise, think what you would urge; to urge, think what you would praise.\n\nTo heighten praise, point out uniqueness, primacy, or superiority. Mention the season and occasion. If he achieved success often, emphasize it to credit him, not luck. Mention if he inspired new observances (like Hippolochus or Harmodius). Censure bad men for the opposite.\n\nIf you lack material, compare him with others, especially famous men. Surpassing the great is noble. If not famous men, compare him with ordinary people; superiority reveals excellence. Heightening effect suits declamations (epideictic); examples suit deliberative; enthymemes suit forensic speeches.\n\nThese are the lines for speeches of praise or blame. We know the materials for encomiums and censures. Censure simply reverses the grounds of praise.\n\nWe must now discuss Accusation and Defence, and the ingredients of their syllogisms. We must ascertain three things: the incentives to wrongdoing, the state of mind of wrongdoers, and the kind of persons wronged. We will deal with these in order, after defining 'wrongdoing'.\n\n'Wrongdoing' is injury voluntarily inflicted contrary to law. Law is either special (written law of a community) or general (universal unwritten principles). Voluntary acts are done consciously and without constraint. All deliberate acts are conscious. The causes of deliberate, illegal harm are vice and lack of self-control. A man's wrongs correspond to his bad qualities. The mean man wrongs others for money; the profligate, for pleasure; the effeminate, for comfort; the coward, from terror. The ambitious man seeks honor; the quick-tempered, anger; the victory-lover, victory; the embittered, revenge; the stupid, from misguided notions; the shameless, from indifference.\n\nWe have partly discussed this under virtues and will discuss it further under emotions. Now let us consider motives and victims.\n\nFirst, what do people try to get or avoid when wronging others? The prosecutor must consider which inducements affect his adversary; the defendant, which do not. Every action is due either to the person himself or not. Actions not due to himself are due to chance, necessity (compulsion), or nature. Actions due to himself are due to habit or craving (rational or irrational). Rational craving is a wish for good. Irrational craving is anger or appetite.\n\nThus, every action springs from one of seven causes: chance, nature, compulsion, habit, reasoning, anger, or appetite. Distinctions based on age or condition are superfluous. Young men act from anger or appetite, not youth. Poor men crave money from appetite, not poverty. Just and unjust men act from reasoning or emotion. However, certain actions and people usually go together. Accessory qualities like wealth or luck are important.\n\nChance events have no determined cause, no purpose, and no regularity. Natural events have a fixed internal cause and occur uniformly. Compelled events happen contrary to desire, through the doer's agency. Habitual acts are done from frequent repetition. Reasoned acts aim at a useful end (real or apparent). Anger causes acts of revenge. Punishment aims at the offender's good; revenge, at the punisher's satisfaction. Appetite causes all acts that appear pleasant. Habit also makes things pleasant.\n\nTo sum up: all voluntary actions either are or seem good or pleasant. I count escape from evil as a good, and escape from pain as a pleasure. We must therefore ascertain what is useful and what is pleasant. We have discussed the useful; now for the pleasant.\n\nPleasure is a movement bringing the soul consciously into its normal state; pain is the opposite. Thus, what produces this condition is pleasant; what destroys it is painful. Moving toward a natural state is pleasant, especially when the process completes recovery. Habits are pleasant because the habitual becomes natural; the often is akin to the always.\n\nWhat is unforced is pleasant. Force is unnatural and painful; \"All that is done on compulsion is bitterness unto the soul.\" Acts of concentration and effort are painful unless habitual. Ease, relaxation, amusement, rest, and sleep are pleasant because they are uncompelled. Satisfied desires are pleasant. Irrational desires (thirst, hunger, sex) originate in the body. Rational desires arise from opinion; we desire what we are told is good.\n\nPleasure is conscious emotion. Imagination is feeble sensation; memory and expectation retain images. Thus, memory and expectation are accompanied by sensation and pleasure. We enjoy present things, remember past ones, and expect future ones. Remembering is pleasant, even of past pains, if the results were noble. \"Sweet 'tis when rescued to remember pain.\" Being free from evil is pleasant.\n\nExpecting delight or benefit is pleasant. Generally, what delights in the present delights in memory or expectation. Even anger is pleasant—\"sweeter than honeycomb\"—because we enjoy the prospect of vengeance. We do not get angry where vengeance is impossible.\n\nMost appetites involve pleasure in memory or expectation. Fever patients enjoy remembering drinks. Lovers enjoy talking or writing about the beloved, recalling him to the imagination. Love begins when one feels pain at absence and pleasure in memory. Even mourning has pleasure; we grieve the loss but enjoy remembering the person. \"He spake, and in each man's heart he awakened the love of lament.\"\n\nRevenge is pleasant. Failing to get it is painful; expecting it is pleasant. Victory is pleasant to everyone, not just bad losers; the winner sees himself as a champion. Thus, combative sports, games, and hunting are pleasant. Where there is competition, there is victory. Debating is pleasant to those with capacity for it.\n\nHonour and good repute are highly pleasant. They make a man see himself as fine, especially when credited by good judges—neighbors, associates, contemporaries, the sensible. We value honour from those we esteem, not from children or animals.\n\nFriends are pleasant. Loving is pleasant (like loving wine). Being loved is pleasant; it confirms one's goodness. To be admired is pleasant for the honour. Flattery is pleasant because the flatterer seems to admire and like us.\n\nRepetition is pleasant (habit). Change is also pleasant (nature). Invariable repetition causes excess. \"Change is in all things sweet.\" Rare things are pleasant. Learning and wondering are pleasant; wondering implies a desire to learn. Imitation (painting, sculpture, poetry) is pleasant even if the object is unpleasant; we learn by inferring \"That is so-and-so.\" Dramatic turns and escapes are pleasant because they are wonderful.\n\nKinship is pleasant. Like delights like (\"jackdaw to jackdaw\"). Since every man is akin to himself, self-love is natural. We love our own deeds, words, and children. Completing what is defective is pleasant; the result becomes our own work. Power and wisdom are pleasant. Disparaging neighbors is pleasant to the ambitious. Doing what one does best is pleasant. \"To that he bends himself... wherein he is indeed the best part of himself.\" Amusement, relaxation, and laughter are pleasant; hence the ludicrous is pleasant. We discuss this in the Poetics.\n\nSo much for pleasant things. Their opposites are unpleasant.\n\nThese are the motives for wrongdoing. We must next consider the wrongdoer's state of mind and the persons he wrongs.\n\nWrongdoers must believe they can do the deed, either secretly or with impunity, or that the gain outweighs the punishment. We will discuss apparent possibility later. Men think they can wrong others with impunity if they possess eloquence, practical ability, legal experience, many friends, or money. They feel safest if they have these advantages personally; if not, they rely on friends or partners. They also feel safe if they are on good terms with their victims or the judges. Victims on good terms are off their guard and settle easily; judges favor friends and impose light sentences.\n\nThey avoid detection if their appearance contradicts the charge: a weakling is unlikely to be charged with assault, or an ugly man with adultery. Public and open injuries are easy because nobody expects them and therefore nobody guards against them. The same applies to terrible crimes; nobody guards against a disease nobody has ever had.\n\nYou feel safe if you have no enemies or many. If none, you are unwatched; if many, people think you would not risk it, and you can plead that you never would have. You may also trust to the way or place of the crime, or to means of disposal.\n\nYou may feel you can postpone a trial, corrupt judges, or avoid paying damages. You may have nothing to lose. You may see the gain as great, certain, and immediate, and the penalty as small, uncertain, or distant. Or the gain may outweigh any retribution, as with despotic power. You may profit solidly while suffering only bad names. Conversely, the crime may bring credit (avenging a parent) while the penalty is merely a fine.\n\nPeople are led by either motive, but not by both; they affect opposite characters. You may be encouraged by past escapes or by past failures (refusing to give up). Weak-willed persons prefer immediate pleasure and later pain; sensible persons prefer immediate pain and later profit. You may make the crime appear due to chance, necessity, or habit—as if you failed to do right rather than did wrong. You may trust to equitable judgment, or be stimulated by want (of necessaries or luxuries). A good reputation saves you from suspicion; a bad one means nothing can make it worse.\n\nSuch are the wrongdoer's states of mind. Now for the victims and the methods. People wrong those who have what they want. Victims may be near (quick profit) or far (slow vengeance). They may be trustful (easy to elude), easy-going (too lazy to prosecute), sensitive (avoiding money fights), or already wronged and silent (the \"Mysian prey\"). They may be those never wronged (unguarded) or often wronged (expecting no more).\n\nThey wrong those with attacked characters, who fear judges. They wrong those they can pretend treated them badly; wickedness needs only a pretext. They wrong enemies because it is pleasant, and friends because it is easy. They wrong the friendless and the ineloquent. They wrong foreigners and small farmers, who settle for a trifle. They wrong those who have wronged others; this feels like no wrong at all.\n\nThey wrong those who have done or intended wrong, for it seems fine to wrong them. They wrong those to gratify friends, masters, or admirers. They wrong those from whom they expect equitable treatment. They wrong those against whom they have a grievance (like Callippus to Dion). They wrong those about to be wronged by others, to forestall them (like Aenesidemus and Gelon). They wrong others to do many righteous acts, curing the harm easily (as Jason said).\n\nThey commit common wrongs, expecting forgiveness. They commit wrongs easily kept dark—involving consumables, changeables, or portables. They commit wrongs the victim is ashamed to speak of (outrages to women or self). They commit trifling wrongs that appear litigious to prosecute.\n\nThis covers the circumstances, nature, victims, and reasons of wrongdoing.\n\nWe must classify just and unjust actions. They are defined by two kinds of law and two classes of persons. Law is particular or universal. Particular law is what a community lays down for itself, written or unwritten. Universal law is the law of Nature. There is a natural justice binding on all men, even without covenant. Sophocles' Antigone appeals to this when she calls burying Polyneices just by nature: \"Not of to-day or yesterday it is, But lives eternal...\" Empedocles says killing no living creature is an all-embracing law.\n\nActions affect either the community or a member of it. Thus, we can do right or wrong toward a definite person or toward the community. Adultery and assault wrong a person; draft evasion wrongs the community.\n\nThus, unjust actions affect either the community or an individual. \"Being wronged\" implies intentional injury. To be wronged, a man must suffer actual harm against his will. The forms of harm correspond to goods and evils. Every accusation concerns an action affecting the community or an individual. The doer must either intend the action or not. Intentional acts spring from deliberate choice or passion.\n\nOften a man admits the act but denies the label. He took a thing, but did not steal it; struck first, but committed no outrage. We must distinguish theft, outrage, and adultery from simple acts. Deliberate purpose constitutes criminal guilt. A blow is outrage only if meant to insult. Taking is theft only if meant to injure the owner and keep the object.\n\nWe have discussed written ordinances. Unwritten law has two varieties. First, conduct springing from exceptional goodness or badness, bringing honor or censure (e.g., gratitude, helping friends). Second, equity. Equity makes up for defects in written law. It is just, but goes beyond the written law. Legislators sometimes omit it inadvertently, or because they cannot define things exactly. They must legislate generally, though the rule only holds usually. If a precise statement is impossible, the law uses wide terms. Thus, a man lifting a finger-ring to strike is guilty by the letter, but innocent by equity.\n\nEquity applies to forgivable actions. It distinguishes errors and misfortunes from crimes. A misfortune has unexpected results not due to vice. An error has expected results not due to vice. A crime has expected results due to vice. Equity bids us be merciful to human weakness; to look to the legislator's meaning, not his words; to the intention, not the act; to the whole story, not the detail; to the man's past, not his present. It bids us remember benefits received; to be patient when wronged; to prefer arbitration to litigation, for the arbitrator looks to equity, the judge to law.\n\nThe worse act springs from the worse disposition. Thus, trifling acts may be the worst. Callistratus charged Melanopus with cheating temple-builders of three half-obols; the potential crime was great. Conversely, the worse act is sometimes the one causing greater harm.\n\nRhetorically, we may argue that the accused broke many obligations—oaths, promises, pledges, rights. Or that he committed the crime in a place of punishment (a law court), showing he would commit it anywhere.\n\nThe deed is worse if it involves special shame, or wrongs benefactors (harming those he should help). It is worse if it breaks unwritten laws, for the better man is just voluntarily, not by force. Conversely, it may be worse if it breaks written laws, for he who defies terrible penalties will not hesitate where there are none.\n\nWe must cursorily view the five \"non-technical\" means of persuasion: laws, witnesses, contracts, tortures, and oaths.\n\nFirst, laws. If the written law opposes our case, appeal to the universal law and equity. Argue that \"honest opinion\" means not following the written law blindly. Urge that equity and universal law are changeless and natural, unlike written laws (as Antigone argued). Argue that true justice is profitable; sham justice (bad law) is not. Law is like silver; judges must assay it. The better man follows unwritten law. Or argue the law contradicts another law or itself. Or interpret ambiguity in favor of justice. Or argue the law's occasion has passed.\n\nIf the written law supports us, argue that \"honest opinion\" prevents perjury, not lawlessness. No one chooses absolute good, but good for himself. Not using laws is having no laws. It does not pay to be cleverer than the doctor or the laws.\n\nWitnesses are ancient (poets, notables) or recent (risk-sharers). Athenians appealed to Homer; Themistocles to an oracle. Proverbs are evidence. Recent witnesses are well-known people whose opinions support us. Witnesses sharing the risk validly attest facts, not quality. For quality, detached persons are trustworthy. Ancient witnesses are most trustworthy, being incorruptible.\n\nIf you have no witnesses, argue that judges must decide by probabilities, which cannot be bribed or perjure themselves. If you have witnesses, argue that probabilities cannot be cross-examined and that witnesses make the case clearer.\n\nEvidence may refer to us or our opponent, to fact or character. We can always find evidence of our worth or our opponent's worthlessness. Arguments about a witness's friendship, enmity, or reputation follow general lines.\n\nConfirm or upset contracts like witnesses. If the contract supports us, insist on its importance. A contract is a special law; disregarding it undermines the law and human intercourse. If it opposes us, use arguments against bad laws. The judge seeks justice, not just legality. Fraud or force invalidates a contract. Check if it contravenes laws or other contracts, or if it harms the judges' interests.\n\nTorture is evidence by compulsion. If it helps us, argue it is infallible. If it hurts us, argue that people lie under torture to end the pain, often falsely accusing. Quote familiar cases.\n\nOaths offer four possibilities: offer and accept, neither, or one without the other.\n\nIf you refuse to offer an oath, argue that men perjure themselves. You trust the judges more than your opponent.\n\nIf you refuse to accept an oath, argue that an oath is always paid for. If you were a rascal, you would swear for gain; your refusal shows high principle. \"Tis not fair that he who fears not God should challenge him who doth.\"\n\nIf you accept an oath, argue you trust yourself, not your opponent. It is fair for the impious to offer and the pious to accept. It is monstrous to refuse an oath when you ask judges to swear.\n\nIf you offer an oath, argue that piety leaves the issue to the gods. Your opponent should not want other judges than himself.\n\nCombine these arguments for mixed cases.\n\nIf you have sworn a contradictory oath, argue it is not perjury, for crime requires voluntary intent. Perjury depends on intention, not words. If your opponent has done so, argue he is an enemy of society who defies the laws.\n\nSo much for non-technical persuasion.\n\nWe have considered the materials for political, ceremonial, and forensic oratory—the received opinions on which we base our arguments.\n\nSince rhetoric exists to affect decisions, the orator must not only demonstrate his argument but also present his character rightly and put the audience into the right frame of mind. Character matters most in politics; emotion, in lawsuits. Friendly hearers judge differently from hostile ones. To the friendly, the accused seems innocent; to the hostile, guilty. Eager hearers expect success; indifferent ones do not.\n\nThree things inspire confidence in the orator's character: good sense, good moral character, and goodwill. False statements or bad advice spring from the lack of these. Men may lack sense; or they may have sense but lack integrity, concealing their true thoughts; or they may have both but lack goodwill, failing to recommend the best course. These are the only causes. Therefore, he who appears to possess all three inspires trust. We have analyzed good sense and character in our discussion of virtues. We must now discuss goodwill and friendliness under the head of emotions.\n\nEmotions are feelings that change men so as to affect their judgments, attended by pain or pleasure. Examples are anger, pity, and fear. We must analyze each under three heads: the state of mind, the people causing it, and the grounds. Unless we know all three, we cannot arouse emotion. Let us proceed.\n\nAnger is an impulse, accompanied by pain, to a conspicuous revenge for a conspicuous slight directed without justification toward oneself or one's friends. It is always felt toward a particular individual, not \"man\" in general. It arises because the other has done or intended something to him or his friends. It is always attended by pleasure—the expectation of revenge. The angry man aims at what he can attain, and the belief in attainment is pleasant. \"Sweeter it is by far than the honeycomb...\" The thoughts dwell on the act of vengeance, causing pleasure like dreams.\n\nSlighting is the active opinion that something is unimportant. We consider bad and good things important; we slight what has no such tendency. There are three kinds of slighting: contempt, spite, and insolence. Contempt slights the unimportant. Spite thwarts another's wishes, not for gain but to prevent his gain. Spite arises because you do not fear him (or you would not slight him) nor respect him (or you would want his friendship). Insolence shames the victim, not for gain, but for pleasure. The insolent man feels superior. Youth and rich men are insolent. Robbing people of honour is a form of insolence. Achilles says: \"He hath taken my prize... and hath done me dishonour.\" A man expects respect from inferiors in birth, capacity, or goodness. \"Great is the wrath of kings...\" He also expects it from those he has treated well.\n\nEvidently, we get angry when we are in pain. In this condition, we always aim at something. If anyone opposes us—preventing us from drinking when thirsty—we get angry. Sickness, poverty, love, thirst, or any unsatisfied desire makes us prone to anger, especially against those who slight our distress. The sick man is angered by disregard of his illness; the lover, by disregard of his love. Each man's emotion predisposes him to his particular anger. We are also angered by unexpected results; unexpected evil is especially painful.\n\nThese are the frames of mind. We get angry with those who laugh or mock at us (insolence). With those who inflict insolent injuries (neither retaliatory nor profitable). With those who despise what we care about (philosophy, appearance), especially if we suspect we lack the quality. With friends who treat us badly or fail to return kindnesses. With inferiors who oppose us (they seem to despise us). We get angry with men of no account if they slight us. We get angry with friends who do not speak well of us, or fail to perceive our needs (like Plexippus with Meleager); this shows negligence. We get angry with those who rejoice at our misfortunes or are indifferent to our pain (bringers of bad news). With those who listen to stories about our weaknesses. With those who slight us before rivals, admirers, or those we revere. With those who slight those we must champion (parents, children). With those who do not return a favor. With those who reply with levity to seriousness. With those who treat us less well than others. With those who forget our names; forgetfulness shows negligence, and negligence is slighting.\n\nWe have set forth the persons, frame of mind, and reasons for anger. The orator must bring his hearers into a frame of mind disposed to anger, and show his adversaries as deserving it.\n\nCalmness is the settling down of anger. We feel calm toward those who do not slight us, or do so involuntarily, or intended the opposite. We feel calm toward those who treat themselves as they treated us (no one slights himself). We feel calm toward those who admit their fault and regret it; we accept their grief as satisfaction. We punish servants who deny their fault, but forgive those who admit it. Denial is shameless; admission is humble. We feel calm toward those who humble themselves, for they admit inferiority and fear, and fear precludes slighting. Even dogs do not bite those who sit down. We feel calm toward those serious when we are serious; toward benefactors; toward suppliants. We feel calm toward those who do not insult worthy people. We are not angry with those we fear or respect. We are not angry with those who acted from anger, for they did not slight us (slighting is painless, anger is painful).\n\nPeople are calm when amused, laughing, feasting, prosperous, or satisfied—when free from pain. Time also calms anger. Vengeance on one person calms anger against another. Philocrates said, \"I will defend myself when I see someone else calumniated.\" The people acquitted Ergophilus because they had just condemned Callisthenes. Men become calm if the offender is convicted or suffers worse than they would have inflicted; they feel avenged. They become calm if they feel they are in the wrong and suffer justly. We should inflict a preliminary punishment in words to satisfy this feeling. We become calm if the offender will not know we punished him. Anger requires individual recognition. Odysseus insisted the Cyclops know who blinded him. We cease to be angry with the dead, who feel no pain. As Apollo said of Achilles abusing Hector: \"For behold in his fury he doeth despite to the senseless clay.\"\n\nTo calm others, use these arguments. Put the hearers into the right frame of mind. Represent those they are angry with as formidable, worthy of reverence, benefactors, involuntary agents, or deeply distressed.\n\nLet us now discuss Friendship and Enmity. We define friendly feeling as wishing for another what you believe to be good, for his sake, and trying to bring it about. A friend feels this and excites it in return. A friend shares your pleasure in good and your pain in unpleasantness, for your sake. This shared feeling is the token of good wishes; we are glad when we get what we wish, and pained when we do not.\n\nFriends share the same views on good and evil. They are friendly or unfriendly to the same people. Thus, they wish for each other what they wish for themselves. We feel friendly to benefactors (of ourselves or those we care for), provided the kindness was for our sake. We like those who wish to treat us well. We like our friends' friends and those who like whom we like. We like those who dislike whom we dislike; they share our view of good, so they wish us good.\n\nWe like those willing to treat us well in money or safety—the liberal, brave, and just. The just do not live on others; they work, like farmers. We like temperate men because they are not unjust. We like those who mind their own business. We like those who wish to be our friends, if they are morally good or well thought of. We like those pleasant to live with: the good-tempered, the uncritical, the unquarrelsome (quarrelers seem to wish the opposite of our wishes), and those who can make and take a joke.\n\nWe like those who praise our good qualities, especially those we doubt we possess. We like the cleanly. We like those who do not reproach us or nurse grudges, but are ready to make up. We like those who are not evil speakers, who see only our good points. We like those who do not thwart us when angry or earnest. We like those who admire us, believe in our goodness, or enjoy our company, especially regarding qualities we wish admired. We like those like ourselves in character and occupation, provided they do not compete with us (\"Potter to potter... begrudge their reward\").\n\nWe like those who desire what we desire, if we can share it; otherwise, trouble arises. We like those before whom we can do wrong without blushing (respecting their opinion but trusting them), and those before whom we would be ashamed to do wrong. We like rivals we wish to envy us without ill-feeling. We like those we help, if we do not suffer heavily. We like those faithful in our absence; hence we love those faithful to the dead. We like those who do not desert friends in trouble. We like those honest with us about their own weaknesses. We like those who do not frighten us.\n\nFriendship has forms like comradeship, intimacy, and kinship.\n\nCauses of friendship are doing kindnesses, doing them unasked, and not proclaiming them.\n\nEnmity and Hatred are opposite to friendship. Enmity springs from anger, spite, or calumny. Anger arises from offences against oneself; enmity may arise from character alone. We hate thieves and informers generally. Anger is cured by time; hatred is not. Anger aims at pain; hatred, at harm. The angry man wants his victim to feel; the hater does not care. Pain is felt; the greatest evils (injustice, folly) are not. Anger involves pain; hatred does not. The angry man may pity; the hater never pities, for he wishes the object's destruction.\n\nThus we can prove people friends or enemies, or refute such claims, or attribute actions to anger or hatred as preferred.\n\nLet us discuss Fear. Fear is a pain or disturbance due to a mental picture of some destructive or painful evil in the future. We fear only imminent, great pains or losses, not remote ones (like death) or painless evils (like stupidity).\n\nFear is caused by whatever has the power to destroy or greatly harm us. Indications of such things are terrible, implying danger. We fear the enmity and anger of the powerful, for they are ready to act. We fear injustice possessed of power. We fear outraged virtue possessing power (it wishes to retaliate). We fear those who fear us (they are ready to strike). We fear being at another's mercy, especially if we have done something horrible; accomplices may betray us. We fear those who can wrong us, for men usually wrong others when they can. We fear those we have wronged, for they watch for opportunity. We fear powerful wrongdoers, for they fear retaliation. We fear rivals. We fear those feared by stronger people, and those who have destroyed stronger people. We fear those attacking the weak; they will soon be stronger.\n\nWe fear the quiet, dissembling, unscrupulous enemy more than the outspoken one; we never know when he will strike. Terrible things are worse if mistakes are irretrievable or remediable only by enemies. Things we cannot help are terrible. Generally, we fear what we pity in others.\n\nTo feel fear, we must believe something destructive is likely to happen to us, from particular persons, at a particular time. Those in great prosperity (insolent, reckless) do not fear. Those who have experienced every horror (callous) do not fear; fear requires some faint hope of escape. Fear sets us thinking what to do; hopelessness does not.\n\nTherefore, the orator must make the audience feel they are in danger. He must show that stronger people have suffered, and that people like themselves are suffering unexpectedly.\n\nConfidence is the opposite of fear. It is the expectation of safety and the absence of terror. We feel confident if we can cure or prevent trouble; if we have neither wronged nor been wronged; if we have no strong rivals, or if our strong rivals are friends. We feel confident if our interest aligns with the stronger or more numerous party.\n\nWe feel confident if we have often succeeded or escaped danger. Men face danger calmly from inexperience or from possession of means. We feel confident if our equals or inferiors are not afraid, or if we have conquered our superiors. We feel confident if we possess more formidable advantages (wealth, strength, territory) than our rivals. We feel confident if we have wronged no one, or at least not the formidable. We feel confident if our relations with the gods are satisfactory; anger makes us confident because we believe the gods side with the wronged. We feel confident if we believe we cannot fail.\n\nShame is pain or disturbance regarding bad things, present, past, or future, which seem likely to involve discredit. Shamelessness is indifference to these things. We feel shame at things disgraceful to ourselves or those we care for.\n\nDisgraceful things include those due to vice: throwing away a shield (cowardice); wronging people about money (injustice); forbidden intercourse (licentiousness); making petty profit from the poor or dead (greed); giving little help or accepting help from the poor; begging like a loan or asking a return like a beggar; praising to beg; persisting after failure (meanness). Flattery is disgraceful: praising a man to his face, glozing his weaknesses. Effeminacy is disgraceful: unable to endure what the old or delicate endure. Accepting benefits often and abusing the giver is mean. Boastfulness is talking incessantly of oneself.\n\nWe feel shame at lacking honourable things shared by our equals (race, country, family, age). It is worse if the lack is our own fault. We feel shame at suffering dishonourable acts, like submitting to outrage. Yielding to lust is shameful, willing or unwilling; unresisting submission shows unmanliness.\n\nWe feel shame before those whose opinion matters: those we admire, those who admire us, those we wish to admire us, rivals, and those whose opinion we respect (the sensible, elders, educated). We feel more shame if the act is open; \"shame dwells in the eyes.\" We feel shame before those always present or observant; before those innocent of the same fault (their opinion is opposite); before those hard on others; before those who tell tales (evil-speakers, satirists, wronged persons). We feel shame before those who have not seen us come to grief, especially those just beginning to be friends. We are ashamed of the evidences of guilt as well as the acts. We are ashamed before those who will tell others. We are not ashamed before those we despise (children, animals). We are ashamed of genuine faults before intimates, and conventional ones before strangers.\n\nWe feel shame when the people mentioned are looking on or near. We do not wish to be seen in misfortune by those who once envied us. We feel shame at bringing dishonour on our own or our ancestors' exploits. We feel shame before those who model themselves on us. We feel more shame if we must live continually with those who know our disgrace. Antiphon asked those covering their faces before execution: \"Why cover your faces? Is it lest some of these spectators should see you to-morrow?\"\n\nKindness is helpfulness toward someone in need, not for return or for the helper's advantage, but for that of the person helped. Kindness is great if the need is great (important, hard to get, or at a crisis), or if the helper is the only, first, or chief one to help. Needs arise from natural cravings accompanied by pain, such as appetites in danger and pain. Hence small help in great need (poverty, banishment) is real kindness.\n\nWe must argue that the persons helped are in such need and the helpers meet it. To eliminate the idea of kindness, argue that the helpers acted for their own interest, or accidentally, or under compulsion. Or that they were merely returning a favor; a return is not a kindness. Consider all categories: substance, magnitude, quality, time, place. Point out if they refused a smaller service before, or helped enemies more. Or if the thing given was worthless and they knew it; no one needs the worthless.\n\nPity is a feeling of pain at the sight of destructive or painful evil befalling one who does not deserve it, which we might expect to befall ourselves or a friend soon. To feel pity, we must be capable of supposing evil may happen to us. Those completely ruined do not feel it (they have nothing worse to fear); nor do those who think themselves immensely fortunate (they think they are safe).\n\nThose who fear evil are: those who have escaped it; the elderly (from experience); the weak (cowards); the educated (who take long views); those with parents, wives, or children (who are vulnerable). Also those not moved by courage (anger, confidence) or insolence (who ignore danger) or panic (who fear only for themselves). We must also believe some people are good; if we think nobody good, we think everyone deserves evil. Generally, we pity when we remember similar past misfortunes or expect future ones.\n\nWe pity destructive or painful evils: death, bodily injury, old age, disease, lack of food. Also evils due to chance: friendlessness, deformity, weakness, mutilation, disappointment (evil whence good was expected), repeated misfortune. Also good coming too late (gifts for Diopeithes after death), or inability to enjoy good fortune.\n\nWe pity those we know, but not too closely; for close relations, we feel terror, not pity. Amasis wept for his friend begging, not his son dying; the latter was terrible. The terrible casts out pity. We pity those like us in age, character, disposition, standing, or birth; their misfortune seems likely to befall us. What we fear for ourselves, we pity in others.\n\nSince proximity excites pity, those who use gestures, tones, and dress to visualize the disaster succeed best. They make it seem close, just past or coming. Tokens (garments) and actions of sufferers are piteous. Most piteous is when noble persons suffer; their innocence and the vividness make the misfortune seem close.\n\nIndignation is the opposite of pity. It is pain at unmerited good fortune, just as pity is pain at unmerited bad fortune. Both spring from good character; we should sympathize with unmerited distress and resent unmerited prosperity, for the undeserved is unjust. Envy is akin to indignation but distinct. Envy is pain at the prosperity of equals; indignation is pain at the prosperity of the undeserving. If we fear the other's prosperity will harm us, the feeling becomes fear.\n\nOpposite feelings attend pity and indignation. If we are pained by unmerited distress, we are pleased, or at least not pained, by merited distress (punishment). We rejoice at the prosperity of the deserving. These feelings belong to the same moral character. The malicious man, delighted by others' misfortunes, is identical with the envious man. He who is pained by a thing's existence is pleased by its destruction. All these feelings neutralize pity.\n\nIndignation is pain at undeserved good fortune. We are not indignant at a man for being just or brave; we are indignant at wealth, power, or beauty when undeserved. We are more indignant if the possessor has only just got it; the newly rich offend more than the heirs of old wealth. What is long established seems natural and real.\n\nWe are indignant when anyone gets what is inappropriate. Brave men deserve fine weapons; men of family deserve distinguished marriages. We are indignant when an inferior contends with a superior, especially in the superior's own field.\n\nWe feel indignation if we deserve and have great goods, for it is unjust that inferiors should equal us. We feel it if we are good and honest, loathing injustice. We feel it if we are ambitious for what others get undeservedly. Generally, if we think we deserve a thing and others do not, we are indignant. Servile and unambitious men are not indignant, for they think they deserve nothing.\n\nIf the speech puts the judges into this frame of mind and shows the claimant deserves no pity, they will feel none.\n\nEnvy is pain at the good fortune of equals—not because we want it, but because they have it. Equals are those comparable in birth, relationship, age, disposition, distinction, or wealth. We feel it if we fall just short of having everything; hence the high-placed are envious, thinking others take what is theirs.\n\nAmbitious men are more envious than others; so are the small-minded, to whom everything seems great. We envy things that bring honor and fame. We envy those near us in time, place, age, or reputation. \"Kin can even be jealous of their kin.\" We envy rivals in sport or love. \"Potter against potter.\"\n\nWe envy those whose success is a reproach to us (our equals), showing we missed the good thing by our own fault. We envy those who have what we ought to have, or once had. Old men envy the young; the spendthrift envies the thrifty.\n\nEmulation is pain caused by seeing the presence, in persons like ourselves, of highly valued good things possible for us to acquire. It is felt not because others have them, but because we do not. It is a good feeling felt by good persons; envy is a bad feeling felt by bad persons. Emulation moves us to secure the goods; envy moves us to stop our neighbor from having them.\n\nEmulation is felt by those who believe they deserve good things they lack. No one aspires to the impossible. It is felt by the young and the lofty-minded. Also by those possessing honourable goods (wealth, friends, office), who feel they ought to be good men and therefore deserve such goods. Also by those whom others think deserving. We emulate others in things for which our ancestors or friends are honoured, feeling we deserve them.\n\nObjects of emulation are moral goodness and things useful to others, for men honour the good and the helpful. Also goods that give enjoyment to neighbors, like wealth and beauty.\n\nObjects of emulation are persons who possess these things—courage, wisdom, office. Generals and orators can help many. We emulate those whom many wish to be like, who have many friends, whom we admire, or whom poets praise.\n\nOpposite to emulation is contempt. We despise those subject to bad things contrary to the objects of emulation. We often despise the fortunate who lack honourable goods.\n\nThis completes our discussion of the emotions.\n\nLet us consider character in relation to emotions and moral qualities, corresponding to age and fortune. Ages are youth, prime, and old age. Fortune is birth, wealth, power, and their opposites.\n\nYoung men have strong passions and gratify them indiscriminately. They are swayed most by sexual desire, lacking self-control. Their desires are changeable, fickle, and violent but short-lived; their impulses are keen but not deep. They are hot-tempered, quick to anger, and unable to bear slights, loving honour and victory more than money. They love victory because they desire superiority. They love money little, having never known want.\n\nThey are optimistic, trusting others readily because they have not been cheated often. Nature warms their blood like wine. They live in expectation, not memory; youth has a long future and a short past. This makes them easily cheated. Their hot tempers and hopefulness make them courageous; anger prevents fear, and hope creates confidence. They are shy, accepting social rules. They have exalted notions, not yet humbled by life. They prefer noble deeds to useful ones, living by feeling rather than reasoning. They are fond of friends and companions for the sake of company, not utility.\n\nThey overdo everything, loving and hating too much. They think they know everything and are sure of it. Their wrongs are insults, not malice. They pity others, thinking everyone better than he is, judging by their own harmless natures. They are fond of fun and witty, for wit is well-bred insolence.\n\nElderly men are the contrary. Having lived long and been often deceived, they are sure about nothing and under-do everything. They \"think\" but never \"know,\" always adding \"possibly\" or \"perhaps.\" They are cynical, putting the worse construction on everything. They are suspicious and therefore distrustful. They neither love warmly nor hate bitterly; they love as if they will some day hate, and hate as if they will some day love.\n\nThey are small-minded, having been humbled by life; they desire only what keeps them alive. They are not generous; experience has taught them money is hard to get and easy to lose. They are cowardly and always anticipating danger; old age paves the way for cowardice, for fear is a chill. They love life, especially at the end, desiring most what they lack. They are selfish, guiding their lives by the useful rather than the noble. They are shameless, caring less for opinion than for profit.\n\nThey lack confidence, partly from experience (things go wrong), partly from cowardice. They live by memory, not hope; the past is long, the future short. This makes them loquacious; they enjoy remembering. Their anger is sudden but feeble. Their passions are weak or gone; they are guided by the love of gain. They seem self-controlled because their passions have slackened and they are slaves to gain. They live by reasoning (utility), not moral feeling (goodness). Their wrongs are injuries, not insults. They pity out of weakness, imagining every evil may befall them. They are querulous, not witty.\n\nSuch are the characters of young and elderly men. People approve speeches reflecting their own character; we can now adapt our speeches accordingly.\n\nMen in their prime have a character between the young and the old, free from the extremes of either. They have neither rash confidence nor excessive timidity, but the right amount of each. They neither trust nor distrust everybody, but judge correctly. They guide their lives by both the noble and the useful, neither parsimonious nor prodigal, but fitting. They are brave as well as temperate, and temperate as well as brave. Young men are brave but intemperate; old men, temperate but cowardly. The prime of life unites the valuable qualities of both and replaces their excesses with moderation. The body is in its prime from thirty to thirty-five; the mind, about forty-nine.\n\nNow let us consider the Gifts of Fortune and their effect on character. First, Good Birth. It makes men ambitious; men with a start in life wish to add to it. Good birth implies ancestral distinction. The well-born look down even on those as good as their ancestors, for distant distinction seems greater than recent. Being well-born (coming from fine stock) differs from nobility (being true to the family nature). Most well-born men are poor creatures. Like fruits of the earth, families have varying yields. A good stock produces exceptional men for a while, then degenerates. Clever stocks degenerate toward insanity (Alcibiades, Dionysius); steady stocks toward stupidity (Cimon, Pericles, Socrates).\n\nWealth produces a character easy to see. Wealthy men are insolent and arrogant, affected by their possessions. They feel they have every good thing; wealth becomes the standard of value, and they imagine it buys everything. They are luxurious and ostentatious. Luxurious from living in prosperity; ostentatious and vulgar because they think everyone admires what they admire. Naturally, many beg from them. As Simonides told Hiero's wife, it is better to be rich than wise, \"for I see the wise men spending their days at the rich men's doors.\"\n\nRich men consider themselves worthy of public office, thinking they possess what gives a claim to it. In short, the wealthy character is that of a prosperous fool. The newly rich are worse than the old rich; they lack education in riches. Their wrongs spring from insolence or self-indulgence, not malice—assault or adultery.\n\nPower produces a character partly like the wealthy, partly better. The powerful are more ambitious and manly, aspiring to great deeds. Responsibility makes them serious. They are dignified rather than arrogant—dignity being mild arrogance. Their wrongs are great, not small.\n\nGood fortune produces characters like those described, since these conditions are forms of good fortune. It leads us to gain family happiness and bodily advantages. It makes men supercilious and reckless, but also pious, respecting the divine power because of their luck.\n\nThe characters of the poor, unfortunate, and powerless are the opposites of those described.\n\nPersuasive speech leads to decisions. Even when addressing a single person (as in scolding), he is your judge. In arguing against a proposition, we still attack arguments as if they were opponents. In ceremonial speeches, onlookers are judges. Strictly, a judge decides public controversies (lawsuits, debates). We have already discussed the characters marking different constitutions.\n\nWe have now set forth how to invest speeches with moral character.\n\nWe have noted the special arguments for each division of oratory—political, ceremonial, and forensic. We must now discuss arguments common to all: Possible and Impossible, Past and Future, and Size (Amplification). Amplification suits ceremonial speeches; the Past, forensic; Possibility and the Future, political.\n\nLet us discuss the Possible and Impossible.\n\nFor Impossibility, use the contrary arguments.\n\nFor Greatness and Smallness (Amplification), use the arguments from deliberative oratory on relative goods. Every orator amplifies utility, nobleness, or justice. Practical facts count more than abstract laws.\n\nArgument by Example has the nature of induction. It has two varieties: mentioning actual past facts, or inventing facts. Invention includes illustrative parallels and fables (like Aesop's).\n\nActual fact: \"We must prepare for war against Persia and not let him subdue Egypt. Darius did not cross the Aegean until he seized Egypt; Xerxes did not attack until he seized Egypt. If the present king seizes Egypt, he will cross.\"\n\nIllustrative parallel (Socrates): \"Public officials should not be selected by lot. That is like selecting athletes by lot instead of by fitness, or steersmen by lot instead of by skill.\"\n\nFables: Stesichorus told the people of Himera, who were giving Phalaris a bodyguard, the fable of the horse and the stag. The horse, wishing to revenge himself on the stag, let a man bridle and mount him. He got his revenge but became a slave. \"Take care,\" said Stesichorus, \"lest in your desire for revenge you become slaves to Phalaris.\"\n\nAesop told the Samians the fable of the fox and the fleas. A fox, stuck in a river, declined a hedgehog's offer to remove her fleas. \"These are full,\" she said; \"fresh ones would drink all my blood.\" Aesop applied this to a popular leader: \"He is wealthy; if you kill him, poor men will come and empty your treasury.\"\n\nFables are easy to invent and suitable for popular addresses. However, actual past events are more valuable for political speakers, since the future usually resembles the past.\n\nIf we cannot argue by Enthymeme, we must use Examples as demonstration. If we can, we should use Examples as supplementary evidence following the Enthymeme. Preceding examples look like induction; following examples look like witnesses. If first, use many; if last, one is sufficient.\n\nA Maxim is a general statement about practical conduct, concerning what should be chosen or avoided. Since Enthymemes deal with such subjects, their premises or conclusions are often maxims. \"Never should any man... Have his sons taught more wisdom than their fellows\" is a maxim; add the reason (\"It makes them idle...\"), and it becomes an Enthymeme.\n\nMaxims may or may not have a supplement. Paradoxical or disputable maxims need proof. Known truths or self-evident views do not. \"Chiefest of blessings is health...\" is a known truth. \"No love is true save that which loves for ever\" is self-evident.\n\nSome maxims with supplements are part of an Enthymeme. Others are Enthymemes in essence but not form; these are the best. \"O mortal man, nurse not immortal wrath.\" The word \"mortal\" implies the reason.\n\nIf a view is paradoxical, put the supplement first and make the maxim the conclusion. \"Since unpopularity is undesirable, it is better not to be educated.\" If not paradoxical but not obvious, add the reason concisely. Stesichorus said: \"Insolence is better avoided, lest the cicalas chirp on the ground.\"\n\nMaxims suit elderly men speaking on experienced subjects. For a young man to use them is unbecoming; for the inexperienced, silly. Country fellows strike out maxims readily.\n\nTo declare a thing universally true when it is not is appropriate for exciting horror or indignation. Even hackneyed maxims are useful; their commonness suggests truth. \"The War-God showeth no favour.\" \"Fool, who slayeth the father...\"\n\nSome proverbs are maxims (\"An Attic neighbour\"). Contradict common maxims if it raises your character or conveys strong emotion. \"It is not true that we ought to know ourselves; had this man known himself, he would never have commanded.\" \"We ought not to treat friends as future enemies, but enemies as future friends.\" Imply the moral purpose in the wording, or add a reason.\n\nMaxims help because unlearned hearers love to hear their own specific opinions expressed as universal truths. If a man has bad neighbors, he agrees that \"Nothing is more annoying than having neighbors.\" The orator must guess the audience's views and express them as general truths.\n\nMost importantly, maxims invest a speech with moral character. They declare moral principles; if the maxims are sound, the speaker appears good.\n\nWe now come to Enthymemes: how to look for them and the lines of argument they embody. The Enthymeme is a rhetorical syllogism. Unlike the dialectical syllogism, it should not reason too far back (causing obscurity) or include every step (wasting words). Uneducated speakers are more effective with crowds because they argue from common knowledge and draw obvious conclusions, whereas the educated lay down general principles. We must start from opinions accepted by our judges or their authorities, and base arguments on probabilities as well as certainties.\n\nWe must know the facts of our subject. To advise Athenians on war, we must know their strength, revenues, friends, and enemies. To eulogize them, we must know their deeds at Salamis or Marathon. Invectives rely on opposite facts. In court, we must know the facts of the case. Whether the subject is Achilles or justice, we must know the facts about him or it.\n\nProof requires facts bearing on the matter. We must select arguments suitable to the subject. We should think out arguments for special needs by keeping our eyes on actual facts. The more actual facts we have, the easier the proof; the more closely they bear on the subject, the less commonplace they seem. Commonplaces (like praising Achilles for being human) apply to many; special facts (slaying Hector) apply to him alone.\n\nThere are two kinds of enthymemes: demonstrative (proving a proposition) and refutative (disproving one). Demonstrative enthymemes join compatible propositions; refutative ones join incompatible propositions.\n\nWe have the lines of argument for special subjects (good, evil, justice, character). We must now consider the subject generally, distinguishing lines of proof from disproof, and valid enthymemes from sham ones. Then we will classify Objections and Refutations.\n\nHere are lines of argument for Enthymemes:\n\nOpposites. Observe whether the opposite of your subject has the opposite quality. If war causes our troubles, peace will put them right.\n\nModifications of the key-word. What applies to \"just\" may not apply to \"justly.\"\n\nCorrelative ideas. If it was right for A to command, it was right for B to obey. But check if it was right for A to command B specifically.\n\nA fortiori. If the gods are not omniscient, certainly men are not. If a quality is absent where most likely, it is absent where less likely. If Hector did well to slay Patroclus, Paris did well to slay Achilles.\n\nTime. If I had bargained for a statue before doing the deed, you would have granted it; will you refuse now that I have done it?\n\nTurning the tables. Apply the opponent's words to himself. \"Would you, Aristophon, betray the fleet?\" \"No.\" \"Then would I, Iphicrates?\" This works only if you are clearly less likely to commit the crime.\n\nDefinition. Define terms like \"supernatural\" or \"noble\" and reason from the definition. \"Goodness is true nobility.\"\n\nAmbiguity. Use the various senses of a word.\n\nLogical division. \"All men do wrong from motive A, B, or C. I did not act from A or B; you do not allege C.\"\n\nInduction. From the case of the woman of Peparethus, argue that women everywhere know the truth about their children.\n\nPrevious decisions. Appeal to decisions by the same judges, or by wise men, or by gods. \"Death is evil; the gods have so judged it, or they would die.\"\n\nParts of a subject. \"What temple has he profaned? What gods has he not honoured?\"\n\nConsequences. Use good and bad consequences to urge or discourage. Education leads to unpopularity (bad) and wisdom (good).\n\nDilemma (Divarication). If you speak right, men will hate you; if wrong, the gods will hate you. Reply: If right, gods love you; if wrong, men love you.\n\nContradicting common opinion. Men praise justice openly but prefer advantage secretly. Establish the view your opponent has not adopted.\n\nRational correspondence. If tall boys are men, short men are boys.\n\nIdentical antecedents. If \"giving earth and water\" and \"sharing the Common Peace\" both mean slavery, treat them as the same.\n\nInconsistency. Men change their minds. \"When exiles, we fought to return; now returned, we choose exile to avoid fighting.\"\n\nPossible motive. Assert a possible motive is the real one. God gives prosperity to make ruin more conspicuous.\n\nInducements and deterrents. Urge action if possible, easy, and useful; or if loss is outweighed by gain.\n\nIncredible truth. Argue that a thing is so incredible it must be true, for no one would invent it. \"Olive-cakes need oil.\"\n\nContradictions. Point out inconsistencies in dates, acts, or words. \"He says he loves you, yet conspired with the Thirty.\"\n\nExplaining false impressions. Show why facts are not as supposed. The woman embraced her son, not her lover.\n\nCause and effect. If the cause is present, the effect is present. If the record was erased, the Thirty must have trusted me.\n\nBetter course. If the accused could have taken a better course, he is innocent (since men choose the best). Fallacious, as the better course is often seen only later.\n\nInconsistency with past action. \"Do not mourn Leucothea if she is a goddess; do not sacrifice if she is a woman.\"\n\nPrevious mistakes. Medea made the mistake of sending her children away; she would have killed Jason, not them.\n\nNames. Draw meanings from names. \"Steel in heart as in name.\" \"Pentheus-a name foreshadowing grief.\"\n\nRefutative Enthymemes are more popular than Demonstrative ones because they are clearer. The best syllogisms are those whose conclusions we foresee or grasp immediately.\n\nSpurious Enthymemes look genuine but are not.\n\nWord-play. (a) Summary conclusion. Listing separate facts (he saved some, avenged others, freed Greeks) to create the impression of a fresh conclusion. (b) Homonyms. Arguing the mouse is noble because the Mysteries are \"most august\" (mysterion/mys). Or praising the dog because of the dog-star.\n\nPart and Whole. Asserting of the whole what is true of parts, or vice versa. \"Thrasybulus put down thirty tyrants\" (adding them up). Or: \"It is right to kill a husband-slayer; it is right for a son to avenge his father; therefore Orestes did right.\" The fallacy lies in omitting context (by whose hand?).\n\nIndignant Language. Painting a high-colored picture without proof. The prosecutor's passion implies guilt; the defendant's, innocence.\n\nSign (Single Instance). \"Lovers are useful to countries, for Harmodius and Aristogeiton overthrew the tyrant.\" \"Dionysius is a thief because he is vicious.\" (Invalid: not all vicious men are thieves).\n\nAccidental as Essential. \"The mice came to the rescue because they gnawed the bowstrings.\" (They gnawed because hungry). \"Achilles was angered because he was not invited.\" (He was angered by the insult, not the missed dinner).\n\nConsequence. \"Paris had a lofty soul because he lived on Ida.\" (Lofty people do, but so do others). \"He is a rake because he dresses fashionably.\" (Rakes do, but not all fashionable men are rakes).\n\nPost hoc ergo propter hoc. \"Demosthenes' policy caused the mischief, for the war happened after it.\"\n\nOmitting Time and Circumstance. \"Paris was justified because Helen's father gave her choice.\" (Choice was for her first marriage only). \"Striking a free man is outrage.\" (Only if unprovoked).\n\nAbsolute vs. Particular. Confusing particular probability with absolute probability.\n\nWe refute arguments by counter-syllogism or objection.\n\nCounter-syllogisms are built from ordinary opinions, which often contradict each other.\n\nObjections are raised in four ways:\n\nEnthymemes are based on Probabilities, Examples, Infallible Signs, or Ordinary Signs.\n\nProbabilities. These argue from what is usually true. They can always be refuted by showing they are not inevitably true. This gives the defense an advantage. However, judges should decide on likelihood, not just certainty. The defendant should show the charge is not likely true, by stating what is more usually true.\n\nFallible Signs. These can be refuted even if the facts are correct, for they do not form a valid logical proof.\n\nExamples. Refuted like probabilities. A single negative instance refutes inevitability. If the opponent has more examples, argue that the present case is unlike them.\n\nInfallible Signs. If the fact is admitted, these cannot be refuted.\n\nAmplification and Depreciation are not elements of an enthymeme (lines of argument), but kinds of enthymeme used to show greatness or smallness.\n\nRefutative Enthymemes are not a different species from Constructive ones. Refutation involves proving the opposite or raising an objection. Proving the opposite uses the same means as construction. An objection is not an enthymeme but a statement showing the opponent reasoned incorrectly or falsely.\n\nWe have now discussed the thought-element (Examples, Maxims, Enthymemes). We must next discuss Style and Arrangement.\n\nA speech requires three studies: persuasion, style, and arrangement. We have covered persuasion (emotions, character, proof) and enthymemes.\n\nNow we discuss style. It is not enough to know what to say; we must say it rightly.\n\nDelivery (voice management, volume, pitch, rhythm) affects success but has been neglected. It is essential for persuasion because of the hearer's defects; ideally, facts alone should suffice. Delivery is acting; it can be taught.\n\nPoets first developed style. Prose initially copied poetry (Gorgias), but they are distinct. Even tragedy has dropped high-flown language for the iambic meter, which resembles speech. We should not imitate a poetic manner that poets themselves have dropped.\n\nGood style must be clear and appropriate. If speech is not clear, it fails. It must be neither mean nor unduly elevated. Clearness comes from using current, ordinary words. Distinction comes from strange words, metaphors, and lengthened forms, as in poetry. But in prose, these must be used sparingly; the subject matter is less exalted.\n\nA writer must disguise his art and seem natural. Naturalness persuades; artificiality makes people suspicious. We can hide our art by selecting words from ordinary speech, as Euripides did.\n\nMetaphor is the prose writer's chief resource, giving clearness, charm, and distinction. Metaphors must be fitting. If you wish to compliment, take the metaphor from something better; if to disparage, from something worse. Iphicrates called Callias a \"mendicant priest\"; Callias called himself a \"torch-bearer.\" Pirates call themselves \"purveyors.\"\n\nMetaphors must sound good. \"Calliope's screech\" is bad because \"screech\" is discordant. Metaphors should come from kindred things. A cup is the \"shield of Dionysus\"; a shield, the \"cup of Ares.\"\n\nWords are not interchangeable; some are fairer or fouler than others. \"Rosy-fingered morn\" is better than \"red-fingered.\" Epithets can also be good or bad: \"mother-slayer\" vs. \"father's avenger.\" Diminutives (like \"goldlet\") make things seem less important.\n\nBad taste in language takes four forms:\n\nCompounds suit dithyrambs; strange words, epics; metaphors, iambics (and prose).\n\nThe Simile is a metaphor with a slight difference. \"He leapt as a lion\" is a simile; \"the lion leapt\" is a metaphor. Similes are useful in prose but less often than in verse. They are employed like metaphors.\n\nAll these can be expressed as similes or metaphors. Similes without the explanation are metaphors.\n\nThe foundation of good style is correctness.\n\nComposition should be easy to read and deliver. Avoid many connectives or hard punctuation (like Heracleitus, where it is unclear if \"always\" goes with what precedes or follows). Avoid solecisms like annexing a verb to two terms that don't fit both (\"perceive\" fits sound and color; \"see\" does not). Avoid parenthesis that interrupts the sense.\n\nSuggestions for impressiveness:\n\nStyle should be appropriate to the subject, emotion, and character. Do not speak casually of weighty matters or solemnly of trivial ones. Do not add ornamental epithets to commonplace nouns (\"O queenly fig-tree\").\n\nExpress emotion: anger for outrage, disgust for impiety. Apt language makes people believe the story; they think you are truthful because you sound like others do when such things happen. An emotional speaker makes the audience feel with him.\n\nExpress character. A rustic and an educated man speak differently. Use the words appropriate to the speaker's age, sex, and nationality.\n\nCounteract exaggeration by criticizing yourself. Do not make everything correspond exactly (voice, face, words), or artifice appears. If words are harsh, do not make voice and face harsh too.\n\nCompound words and epithets suit emotional speeches. We forgive an angry man for calling a wrong \"heaven-high.\" This language fits poetry and deep emotion.\n\nProse should be rhythmical but not metrical. Meter makes the hearer suspicious of artifice. But language without rhythm is unlimited and vague; number limits all things.\n\nThe heroic rhythm is dignified but not conversational. The iambic is conversational but lacks dignity. The trochee is too like dancing. The paean (ratio 3:2) is best. It is less obtrusive.\n\nUse one kind of paean for the beginning (long syllable followed by three short) and the opposite for the end (three short followed by a long). The long syllable at the end gives a sense of closure.\n\nProse must be either free-running (like Herodotus) or periodic.\n\nFree-running style has no natural stops, ending only when the subject ends. It is unsatisfying because indefinite; we like to see the goal.\n\nPeriodic style is divided into periods. A period is a portion of speech with a beginning and end, easily grasped. It is satisfying and easy to follow and remember (because numbered).\n\nPeriods should not break off abruptly. They may be simple (one member) or divided (several members). Members should be neither curt nor long.\n\nPeriodic style is either simply divided or antithetical. Antithesis puts opposites together (\"They aided both those who stayed and those who went\"). This is satisfying because the contrast is clear and logical.\n\nParisosis makes members equal in length. Paromoeosis makes them sound alike at the beginning or end (rhyme, alliteration).\n\nLively and taking sayings come from natural talent or practice, but we can analyze them.\n\nWe like learning easily. Strange words puzzle; ordinary words convey old news. Metaphor brings fresh knowledge. \"Old age is a withered stalk\" teaches us through the common notion of bloom lost. Similes do the same but are less attractive because longer and less direct.\n\nLively speech makes us seize a new idea promptly. We dislike the obvious and the puzzling. We like the antithetical form (\"judging peace a war\") and the metaphorical. Metaphors must not be far-fetched or obvious. They should set the scene before our eyes (Actuality).\n\nThe proportional metaphor is best.\n\nGraphic metaphors imply activity or visibility. \"God kindled reason as a lamp.\" \"Postponing wars, not ending them.\"\n\nMaking hearers \"see things\" means representing them in activity. \"With his vigour in full bloom\" suggests activity; \"four-square\" does not. Homer constantly gives metaphorical life to lifeless things: \"The arrow flew,\" \"The spear drove.\" He represents everything as moving and living.\n\nDraw metaphors from related but not obvious things. Archytas called an arbitrator and an altar the same (both are refuges). An anchor and a hook are the same (one secures from below, one from above).\n\nSurprise conveys liveliness. When words mean something different from what they say, or when a new idea contradicts the old, the hearer is impressed. \"The cicalas will chirp on the ground.\" \"His feet were shod with his—chilblains\" (surprise ending).\n\nJokes often depend on double meanings or slight changes in letters. \"You Thracian slavey\" (Thratt' ei su) sounds like \"You harpplayer\" (Thratteis su). \"The empire (arche) of the sea was not the beginning (arche) of troubles.\"\n\nThe best sayings are brief and antithetical. \"Death is most fit before you do deeds that would make death fit for you.\" This impresses the new idea firmly and quickly.\n\nEach kind of rhetoric has its own style. Written prose differs from spoken; political from forensic.\n\nWritten style is more finished. Spoken style admits dramatic delivery. Professional speeches often sound thin in contests, while orators' speeches look amateurish when read. This is because the latter suit the tussle; unconnected words and repetitions, condemned in writing, work dramatically in speech (if varied in tone).\n\nPolitical oratory is like scene-painting: the bigger the crowd, the more distant the view, and exactness is unnecessary. Forensic oratory requires more exactness, especially before a single judge. A single judge is easily persuaded; he sees the point quickly.\n\nCeremonial oratory is most literary, being meant for reading; forensic is second.\n\nTo be clear, do not be chatty or emotional if you want to be exact. If you want to be dramatic, do not be exact.\n\nA speech has two essential parts: Statement and Argument. You state your case and prove it. It is impossible to state without proving, or prove without stating.\n\nThe current division is absurd. \"Narration\" belongs properly to forensic speech. Introduction, comparison, and recapitulation are not always needed.\n\nThe necessary parts are Statement and Argument. At most, a speech has Introduction, Statement, Argument, and Epilogue. Refutation and Comparison are parts of the Argument. Inventing new names like \"post-narration\" (Theodorus) is pointless unless they indicate real species.\n\nThe Introduction begins the speech, like a prologue or prelude.\n\nIn speeches of display, introductions resemble musical preludes—brilliant passages fitted to the opening. The writer begins with what takes his fancy (praise, censure, advice, or appeal).\n\nForensic introductions resemble dramatic prologues: they preview the theme. \"Sing, O goddess, of the Wrath.\" This is the essential function: to show the aim. If the subject is short and plain, no introduction is needed.\n\nOther introductions are remedial, concerned with the speaker, hearer, subject, or opponent. The defendant removes prejudice at the start; the prosecutor excites it at the close. The defendant must clear obstacles to get a hearing; the prosecutor must make the memory stick.\n\nAppeals to the hearer aim at goodwill, resentment, attention, or distraction. Attention is highest at the beginning, so calls for it are often ridiculous there; use them where interest flags (\"Slip in a bit of the fifty-drachma lecture\").\n\nPolitical introductions are rare because the subject is known. They are used to handle prejudice or magnify/minimize importance.\n\nTo create prejudice, select the worse motive. To remove it, put the better construction on it.\n\nNarration in ceremonial oratory is intermittent. You must survey the actions, but proof is rarely needed. Do not make the narrative continuous; apply the facts. Narrate deeds only if they are not well-known.\n\nAbsurdly, some say narration should be rapid. It should be right—neither long nor curt, but sufficient to make facts plain and credible.\n\nNarrate anything creditable to yourself or discreditable to your adversary (\"He answered he would find other children\"). The defendant narrating should be brief, maintaining the thing did not happen, or was not wrong. Speak of past events as past, unless exciting pity or indignation.\n\nNarration should depict character by indicating moral purpose. Mathematical discourses show no character (no purpose); Socratic dialogues do. Describe manifestations of character (\"He walked as he talked\").\n\nDo not seem inspired by intelligence (which seeks the useful) but by purpose (which seeks the noble). If a detail is incredible, add the cause (Antigone caring more for her brother than husband). If you have no cause, say so.\n\nUse emotions. Relate familiar manifestations (\"He went away scowling\"). Bring yourself on stage in the right character from the start.\n\nPolitical oratory has little narration (of the future), unless recalling the past to help plans or attack character. If a statement is hard to believe, guarantee its truth and explain.\n\nArguments attempt demonstrative proofs. The dispute falls under four heads:\n\nOnly in the first case is one party necessarily a rogue (ignorance is no plea).\n\nIn ceremonial speeches, argue that the deed was noble and useful. The facts are usually taken on trust; prove them only if incredible.\n\nIn political speeches, maintain the proposal is impracticable, unjust, useless, or unimportant. Attack falsehoods in irrelevant matters to discredit the rest. Use examples (past events) rather than enthymemes (which suit forensic oratory better, dealing with non-contingent past facts). Do not use enthymemes incessantly; intersperse them. Do not use them when rousing emotion (it kills the feeling) or depicting character (demonstration shows no moral purpose). Use maxims for character.\n\nIf you have no enthymemes, fall back on moral discourse; it suits a good man better than subtle reasoning. Refutative enthymemes are more popular than demonstrative.\n\nReply to the Opponent is part of the Argument. If speaking first, put your arguments first, then refute. If the other side has strong arguments, demolish them first (like Callistratus). If speaking later, attack the opponent's speech first to clear the ground.\n\nFor moral character, put invidious remarks into a third person's mouth (as Isocrates and Sophocles do). Restate enthymemes as maxims.\n\nUse Interrogation when the opponent's answer to one question makes the next one fatal. Pericles asked Lampon: \"No uninitiated person can be told the rites?\" \"No.\" \"Do you know them?\" \"Yes.\" \"How, being uninitiated?\"\n\nUse it when one premise is obvious and the other must be admitted. Do not ask the obvious one; state the conclusion. Socrates asked Meletus: \"Are not supernatural beings children of gods?\" \"Yes.\" \"Then does anyone believe in children of gods but not gods?\"\n\nDo not question if the opponent has a good answer (\"True, but...\"). Do not ask a series of questions; the audience cannot follow.\n\nReply to ambiguous questions by distinguishing. Reply to contradictions by explaining immediately.\n\nKill earnestness with jesting, and jesting with earnestness (Gorgias). Irony befits a gentleman (amusing himself); buffoonery befits a buffoon (amusing others).\n\nEnd with a disconnected style to mark the close: \"I have done. You have heard me. The facts are before you. I ask for your judgement.\"",

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) — serving out her final days before stepping down from Congress — ripped President Donald Trump’s decision to strike Venezuela.\n\nIn a post to X on Saturday, Greene lashed out at the administration justifying the move on the grounds that they were looking to combat narco-terrorism.\n\n“I’ve served on the Homeland Security Committee for the past three years,” Greene wrote. “I’m 100% for strong safe secure borders and stopping narco terrorists and cartels from trafficking deadly drugs and human trafficking into America. Fentanyl is responsible for over 70% of U.S. drug overdose deaths and fentanyl comes from Mexican cartels made with chemical precursors from China and trafficked across the U.S. Mexico border. Mexican cartels are primarily and overwhelmingly responsible for killing Americans with deadly drugs. If U.S. military action and regime change in Venezuela was really about saving American lives from deadly drugs then why hasn’t the Trump admin taken action against Mexican cartels? And if prosecuting narco terrorists is a high priority then why did President Trump pardon the former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez who was convicted and sentenced for 45 years for trafficking hundreds of tons of cocaine into America? Ironically cocaine is the same drug that Venezuela primarily traffics into the U.S.”\n\nThe next obvious observation is that by removing Maduro this is a clear move for control over Venezuelan oil supplies that will ensure stability for the next obvious regime change war in Iran.\n\nAnd of course why is it ok for America to militarily invade, bomb, and arrest a foreign leader but Russia is evil for invading Ukraine and China is bad for aggression against Taiwan? Is it only ok if we do it? (I’m not endorsing Russia or China)\n\nThe congresswoman, in a subsequent post went on to blast the idea of ousting the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro, through a military action.\n\n“Regime change, funding foreign wars, and American’s (sic) tax dollars being consistently funneled to foreign causes, foreigners both home and abroad, and foreign governments while Americans are consistently facing increasing cost of living, housing, healthcare, and learn about scams and fraud of their tax dollars is what has most Americans enraged,” Greene wrote. “Especially the younger generations. Boomers and half of Gen X will cheer on neocon wars and talking points, but the other half of Gen X and majority on down see through it and hate it. Americans (sic) disgust with our own government’s never ending military aggression and support of foreign wars is justified because we are forced to pay for it and both parties, Republicans and Democrats, always keep the Washington military machine funded and going.”\n\nGreene added, “This is what many in MAGA thought they voted to end. Boy were we wrong.”\n\nAnd in a subsequent post following Trump’s announcement that the U.S. will “run” Venezuela, Greene expressed her disgust with a facepalm emoji.\n\nhttps://x.com/mtgreenee/status/2007505789108543761?s=20\n\nThe post Marjorie Taylor Greene Rips Trump’s Strike on Venezuela: ‘MAGA Thought They Voted to End’ This — ‘Boy Were We Wrong’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "On November 2, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles told Vanity Fair that land strikes in Venezuela would require the approval of Congress. She said that if Trump “were to authorize some activity on land, then it’s war, then (we’d need) Congress.”",
    "fullText": "On November 2, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles told Vanity Fair that land strikes in Venezuela would require the approval of Congress. She said that if Trump “were to authorize some activity on land, then it’s war, then (we’d need) Congress.”\n\nDays later, Trump administration officials privately told members of Congress much the same thing – that they lacked the legal justification to support attacks against any land targets in Venezuela.\n\nJust two months later, though, the Trump administration has done what it previously indicated it couldn’t.\n\nIt launched what Trump called a “large scale strike against Venezuela” and captured its president, Nicolás Maduro, to face charges. And it launched this regime change effort without the approval of Congress.\n\n(Trump in November claimed he didn’t need congressional authorization for land action, but it clearly wasn’t the consensus view in the administration.)\n\nIt appears the mission is, for now, limited to removing Maduro. But as Trump noted, it did involve striking inside the country – the same circumstance some in the administration previously indicated required authorization that it didn’t have. CNN reported back in early November that the administration was seeking a new legal opinion from the Justice Department for such strikes.\n\nAnd Trump in a news conference Saturday spoke repeatedly about not just arresting Maduro, but also running Venezuela and taking over its oil – comments that could certainly be understood to suggest this was about more than arresting Maduro.\n\nLegally dubious strikes inside another country – even ones narrowly tailored at removing a foreign leaders – are hardly unheard of in recent American history. But even in that context, this one is remarkable.\n\nThat’s because the Trump administration has taken remarkably little care to offer a consistent set of justifications or a legal framework for the attack. And it doesn’t even appear to have notified Congress ahead of time, which is generally the bare minimum in such circumstances.\n\nA full explanation of the claimed justification has yet to be issued, but the early signs are characteristically confusing.\n\nRepublican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah said shortly after the strikes that Secretary of State Marco Rubio told him the attack was needed to, in Lee’s words, “protect and defend those executing the arrest warrant” against Maduro.\n\n“This action likely falls within the president’s inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution to protect U.S. personnel from an actual or imminent attack,” said Lee, a frequent critic of unauthorized foreign military action.\n\nHours later, Vice President JD Vance echoed that line.\n\n“And PSA for everyone saying this was ‘illegal’: Maduro has multiple indictments in the United States for narcoterrorism,” Vance said on X. “You don’t get to avoid justice for drug trafficking in the United States because you live in a palace in Caracas.”\n\nAt a later news conference, Rubio echoed the line that the military had been supporting “a law enforcement function.”\n\nBut there are many people living in other countries that are under indictment in the United States; it is not the US government’s usual course to launch strikes on foreign countries to bring them to justice.\n\nThe administration also hadn’t previously indicated that military force could be legally used for this reason.\n\nInitially, Trump threatened land strikes inside Venezuela to target drug traffickers – this despite Venezuela being an apparently somewhat small player in the drug-trafficking game.\n\nLater, the administration suggested strikes might be needed because Venezuela sent bad people into the United States.\n\nAnd then, after initially downplaying the role of oil in the US pressure campaign against Venezuela and Maduro, Trump said he aimed to reclaim “the oil, land, and other assets that they previously stole from us.”\n\nThe signals were confusing enough that even the hawkish Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina in mid-December indicated the administration lacked “clarity” in its messaging.\n\n“I want clarity right here,” Graham said. “President Trump is saying his days are numbered. That seems to me that he’s gotta go. If it’s the goal of taking him out because he’s a threat to our country, then say it. And what happens next? Don’t you think most people want to know that?”\n\nDespite the focus on the law enforcement operation on Saturday, Trump at the news conference said the United States would now participate in running Venezuela, at least temporarily. And he repeatedly spoke about its oil.\n\n“We’re going to rebuild the oil infrastructure,” Trump said, adding at another point: “We’re going to run the country right.”\n\nAnd even if the administration had offered a more consistent justification, that doesn’t mean it would be an appropriate one.\n\nThe most recent major example of using the US military for regime change is, of course, the war in Iraq. That war was authorized by Congress in 2002. The broader war on terror was authorized by Congress in 2001, after the 9/11 attacks.\n\nSince then, administrations have sought to justify several military actions in the Middle East using those authorizations – sometimes dubiously. But Venezuela is in an entirely different theater.\n\nWhile many have compared the effort in Venezuela to Iraq, the better comparison – and one the administration apparently intends to make – is Panama in 1989.\n\nLike in Venezuela, Panama’s leader at the time, Manuel Noriega, was under US indictment, including for drug-trafficking. And like in Venezuela, the operation was less a large-scale war than a narrowly tailored effort to remove the leader from power.\n\nThe Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel in 1980 had concluded that the FBI didn’t have the authority to apprehend and abduct a foreign national to face justice. But George H.W. Bush administration’s OLC quietly reversed that in the summer of 1989.\n\nA memo written by William P. Barr, who would later become attorney general in that Bush administration and Trump’s first administration, said a president had “inherent constitutional authority” to order the FBI to take people into custody in foreign countries, even if it violated international law to do so.\n\nThat memo was soon used to justify the operation to remove Noriega. (As it happens, Noriega was captured the same day Maduro was: January 3,1990.)\n\nBut that memo remains controversial to this day. It’s also an extraordinarily broad grant of authority, potentially allowing US military force anywhere\n\nAnd the situation in Venezuela could differ in that it’s a larger country that could prove tougher to control with its leader in foreign custody. It also has significant oil wealth, meaning other countries could take an interest in what happens there next. (China has called the attack a “blatant use of force against a sovereign state.”)\n\nIn both the news conference and an interview with Fox News on Saturday morning, Trump invoked the possibility of further military option, reinforcing that this could be about more than just arresting Maduro.\n\nThat also means the questions about Trump’s legal authorities could again be tested – just as he’s already tested them with his legally dubious strikes on alleged drug boats and other actions in the region.\n\nWhat’s clear is that Trump is seeking to yet again test the limits of his authority as president – and Americans’ tolerance for it. But this time he’s doing it on one of the biggest stages yet. And the story of his stretching of the law certainly isn’t over.",

    "title": "What to Eat When You Haven’t Pooped in Days, According to Dietitians",
    "description": "When you’re overdue for a BM, these foods and drinks can get things going!",
    "fullText": "Reviewed by Dietitian Karen Ansel, M.S., RDN\n\nConstipation is surprisingly common, affecting as many as 20% of us regularly.\n\nDietitians say prunes, kiwi and flaxseed can help. So can drinking coffee, warm water or kefir.\n\nHydrating, chewing food thoroughly and moving regularly may also ease constipation.\n\nAfter a few days without a satisfying trip to the bathroom, anyone would be desperate to get things moving. As uncomfortable as constipation may be, you’re hardly alone. Up to 20% of U.S. adults experience constipation on a regular basis.\n\nAs vexing as that may be, there are things you can do to get things going again. In fact, relief may be as close as your kitchen. According to dietitians specializing in digestive health, certain foods and drinks can do wonders for easing constipation–even when you haven’t gone in days.\n\nHere are their top choices to provide the relief you need, stat.\n\n“It turns out that the old adage that prunes help with constipation is true!” says Kaytee Hadley, M.S., RDN, IFMCP. Research has found that prunes can help reduce hard, lumpy stools and promote more regular bowel movements in people with chronic constipation. Ditto for prune juice.\n\nWhat makes them so effective? There are several mechanisms, says Hadley. For starters, prunes provide fiber (four prunes contain nearly 3 grams). That fiber draws water into the stool to keep it soft and moving easily.  Prunes also contain sorbitol, a natural sugar that also pulls water into the colon, working as a natural laxative to help you go, says Hadley.\n\nIf you’re wondering how many prunes you should eat for relief, Kinga Portik-Gumbs, RDN, recommends about four prunes per day. That said, these sorbitol-rich fruits aren’t for everyone. “Because of the high sorbitol and fructan content, two types of FODMAPs, they may not be ideal for people who are sensitive to these FODMAP foods,” says Portik-Gumbs.\n\nSeveral recent studies show that kiwifruits are highly effective at relieving constipation.,, One reason is their fiber. Two kiwis provide roughly 6 grams of fiber, giving you more than 20% of the Daily Value in one easy serving. And they have another advantage, says Samina Qureshi, RDN, LD. “Unlike prunes, which are high in sorbitol, kiwifruit is low-FODMAP and often much better tolerated by people who struggle with bloating or IBS,” she explains.\n\nStudies show that eating two kiwifruits per day is the sweet spot. “MRI studies show that eating two kiwifruits daily increases both water and volume in the intestines, supporting regularity and comfort,” says Portik-Gumbs. In fact, research has found that eating two kiwis is more effective for easing chronic constipation than the laxative psyllium.\n\n“Flaxseed has been shown to increase how often you poop and improve stool form,” says Qureshi. One study found that when people with functional constipation consumed 50 grams of flaxseed flour daily for four weeks, they went from having just two weekly bowel movements to seven! And another study found that folks with chronic constipation who consumed 50 grams of ground flaxseed powder daily for one month pooped more frequently and experienced less bloating.\n\nThese powerful little seeds work in several ways to get things moving. “Ground flaxseeds absorb water and form a gel-like texture in the gut that adds bulk, improves stool consistency and helps move waste along,” says Hadley. They may also foster the growth of beneficial gut bacteria linked to less constipation.\n\nPlus, they couldn’t be easier to add to your day. “It’s a simple addition that can easily be added to smoothies, yogurt bowls or baked goods that can have a big impact!” says Qureshi.\n\nIf you’re a coffee lover, you’ll be thrilled to know that a warm cup of coffee may be just what you need to kick your digestive system into gear. And it's not just about caffeine, either. “Both regular and decaf coffee contain several different compounds that stimulate the muscles of the colon, which is why many people feel the urge to go shortly after drinking it,” says Hadley. In as little as four minutes after drinking coffee, the muscles in your colon start contracting, giving you the urge to go.\n\nHowever, if you really want to get the ball rolling, have your coffee with breakfast. Morning is when your body’s digestive rhythms are most likely to be stimulated by food, so it’s the perfect time to nudge your gut, says Qureshi.\n\nIf coffee isn’t your thing, experts recommend starting your day with a cup of warm water. “Consuming warm water first thing in the morning can help stimulate the colon and increase the chances of a successful bowel movement,” says Portik-Gumbs.\n\n“What do yogurt, kefir, kombucha, kimchi and sauerkraut all have in common? These fermented foods and drinks provide beneficial bacteria that can help with constipation while supporting the microbiome,” says Hadley. While all of these are worth weaving into your rotation, kefir has research-backed benefits for constipation relief. For instance, one study found that people who drank kefir daily for eight weeks experienced less constipation, abdominal pain and bloating.  A recent research review study confirms these findings, concluding that—in addition to easing constipation, abdominal pain and bloating—consuming fermented dairy products, like kefir, can also reduce gassiness.\n\nConsuming these foods and drinks is a great start, but it’s not the only strategy that can spell relief. Next time you need some help pooping, give these expert-backed strategies a try.\n\nTry Some Light Exercise. “Gentle movement, like walking after eating, can help stimulate digestion and encourage bowel movements,” says Portik-Gumbs. Go for a stroll or do some gentle stretching after breakfast.\n\nEat Slowly. “Take your time eating and chew foods thoroughly until they’re almost pureed,” advises Portik-Gumbs. “This gives your digestive system a kick start and helps with bowel-movement production.”\n\nHydrate. “Staying well-hydrated keeps stool soft and easier to pass, which is especially important after several days of constipation when it gets hard and dry,” says Hadley. If you’re increasing your fiber intake, it’s especially important to drink more water to help fiber move through your body smoothly.\n\nMassage Your Belly. “A gentle clockwise belly massage can support your body’s natural ability to have a bowel movement,” says Qureshi.\n\nGoing for days without pooping feels like, well, poop. But certain foods and drinks can help. “Choosing the right foods and drinks can make all the difference in how quickly things start moving again,” says Portik-Gumbs. Fiber-rich foods and fluids are good general go-tos. But prunes, kiwifruit, ground flaxseed, coffee, warm water and kefir are especially great for prompting a poop. In addition to weaving these foods into your routine, be sure to hydrate well, chew your food thoroughly and work some gentle movement into your day. If all else fails, try a clockwise belly massage after eating. It just might help!",

Is this a sign of fraud or something that you should be worried about?\n\nLet's take a look at a hypothetical example. Say that John contributes $200 to his 401(k) account every pay period. The money is taken out of his check and invested automatically in a target date fund based on his chosen retirement date.\n\nBut one day, John logs into his account and sees that contributions were made and the fund purchased, and then sees the shares of the fund sold a few days later and the money withdrawn — but the money he contributed isn't put back into his account.\n\nJohn is worried that his employer isn’t telling him anything about this.

When they do, employers must deposit contributions from worker paychecks in a timely manner — within no more than 15 business days into the month following the payday. However, if they can reasonably deposit funds sooner, they must.\n\nEmployers are not allowed to misuse 401(k) funds, and companies must take steps to protect your money, including from cyberattacks.

    "fullText": "A short video. A few words. And suddenly, the internet is on fire.\n\nA Somali TikToker is facing intense backlash after commenting what many interpreted as a threat against Elon Musk. The remark spread fast, pulled Musk into the conversation, and triggered a wave of reactions that raised serious questions about online speech and real-world consequences.\n\nIn the now-viral clip, the TikToker appeared dismissive when Musk’s name came up. Her response stopped people cold.\n\n“I wouldn’t worry too much about him,” she said. “He about to die.”\n\nThe statement didn’t include context, jokes, or qualifiers. Viewers immediately flagged it as disturbing, especially given Musk’s global profile and the climate around public figures and security concerns. The clip moved across X, TikTok, and Reddit within hours.\n\nBOOM! Elon Musk FIRES BACK at the Somali woman threatening his life\n\nWhen fraud is exposed – it’s always the fraudsters who yell and complain the loudest.\n\nTheir THEFT will come to an end. pic.twitter.com/K0sfl3DFl1\n\n— Eric Daugherty (@EricLDaugh) January 2, 2026\n\nElon Musk didn’t ignore it. Instead, he responded directly on X with a blunt message that escalated the situation instantly. “Then it is war.”\n\nThe response fueled speculation. Some saw it as sarcasm. Others read it as a warning. Either way, it ensured the exchange wouldn’t fade quietly.\n\nOnce Musk replied, the clip went from niche content to headline material.\n\nAs the clip circulated, comment sections exploded. Many users expressed shock at how casually the statement was delivered. Others went further, predicting severe consequences for the TikToker.\n\n“She’s about to spend some years behind bars,” one comment read. Another user wrote, “She about to be ‘mysteriously’ missing. I don’t think anyone will care.”\n\nThose comments sparked a second wave of criticism, with users arguing that the backlash itself was becoming dangerous.\n\nSeveral legal-minded users pointed out why the comment raised alarms. Saying that a healthy, relatively young person will die soon can be interpreted as more than opinion.\n\n“When you say that a person who is healthy and not old will die ‘naturally’ soon, this looks like a threat,” one widely shared post argued.\n\nIn many countries, language that implies harm toward a specific individual can trigger investigation, even without explicit details.\n\nThat distinction matters more when the subject is a high-profile figure.\n\nThe situation reopened a familiar debate. Where does free expression end, and where does accountability begin?\n\nSome defended the TikToker, claiming the statement was careless but not criminal. Others argued that public figures face constant danger and that language like this cannot be brushed aside.\n\nPlatforms also came under scrutiny for how quickly content spreads before moderation steps in. Once again, the internet moved faster than clarity.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Musk has become the center of an online firestorm triggered by a single sentence. His presence alone tends to magnify conflicts.\n\nOne comment becomes a movement. One reply becomes a signal. And millions rush to interpret intent. That dynamic keeps repeating, and each time the stakes feel higher.\n\nJUST IN: Somali woman Fardowsa Muhumed is FRANTIC after threatening Elon Musk’s life, to which Elon replied, “then IT IS WAR”\n\nShe’s retracting her threat, and says “[I am] truly in fear for my future!”\n\nCowards.pic.twitter.com/aG1pRqYplt https://t.co/mMkGcIMu7u\n\n— Eric Daugherty (@EricLDaugh) January 2, 2026\n\nIn a video released a few hours ago, the Somali woman has apologized for her comments and claimed the video was taken out of context.\n\n“Let me make myself clear, I never intended or aimed to threaten the life of Elon Musk. I am not a person who carries around hate; the media has taken my words out of context, and it’s been deeply hurtful to watch how that’s turned into me being dehumanized and painted as a villain.",

    "fullText": "In Marin County, flooding left motorists stranded and kayakers paddling Saturday in areas where bicyclists usually pedaled. In San Francisco, storm surge drenched onlookers on the Embarcadero and at Crissy Field.\n\nElsewhere, storm surge forced other road closures in Alameda County and as far as Pacifica and Half Moon Bay.\n\nCalifornia flood map:See real-time updates\n\nMore reading: Heavy snow blankets Sierra, beckoning skiers and challenging drivers\n\nJon Borges surveyed the flooded intersection by the Grand Gasoline gas station just off 101 at De Silva Island Drive in Mill Valley, and his friend's stranded Toyota pickup.\n\n\"I was not expecting that at all,\" he said, of the impacts of the weekend's king tides, which flooded many low-lying areas in Mill Valley, as well as in San Francisco's Embarcadero and elsewhere around the Bay Area.\n\nThe trifecta of a super moon, an incoming storm system's strong winds and heavy rains resulted in a high tide Saturday morning 2.5 feet higher than normal - the highest king tide since Feb. 6, 1998, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Roger Gass. Flooding was reported across the Bay Area in Marin County, Sonoma County, Alameda County, San Mateo County and San Francisco.\n\nThe tide peaked just after 10:30 a.m. Saturday, though its took hours for floodwaters to recede. San Francisco's record high tide was 2.8 feet on Jan. 27, 1998.\n\nThe high tides prompted a coastal flood advisory in effect through 2 p.m. Sunday for much of the Bay Area and Central Coast. The powerful king tides and gusty winds sent seawater into streets, parks and other low-lying areas.  Floodwaters 2 feet deep closed parts of Interstate 80 just west of the metering lights on Oakland's side of the Bay Bridge and forced closure of other roads in Corte Madera, plus numerous roads in Sonoma County.\n\nStorm surge sent sent high waves over coastal jetties in Pacifica and Half Moon Bay, and over the walkways at Pier 14 in San Francisco's Embarcadero, drenching onlookers.\n\nFlash floods also disrupted traffic in Southern California. Southbound Highway 101 in Gaviota (Santa Barbara County) was closed Saturday morning due to a mudslide and flooding covering all lanes.\n\nMill Valley was especially hard hit, with flooding stranding motorists and forcing the closure of intersections.\n\nBorges, 28, had received a call at about 10:30 a.m., as the king tide was peaking.\n\nHis friend tried to drive his Toyota pickup through the flooded intersection and gotten trapped until local firefighters helped extricate him.\n\nBorges lives on a houseboat in Sausalito and is used to king tides, he said, but neither he nor his friend had realized how bad the flooding would be at the intersection by the gas station.\n\n\"We're just waiting for the water to go down enough to get a tow truck,\" he said.\n\nAt Camino Alto and Miller Avenue, Mill Valley Department of Public Works employees blocked a flooded intersection.\n\n\"It's the first time I've ever seen it this nasty,\" said Mark Bartel, who started working for the department six months earlier.\n\nThe department had to close other roads for minor flooding two months earlier, but \"it was nothing like this,\" he said as he waved motorists into the parking lot of the adjoining Safeway.\n\nA few yards down the way, Jen Bennett, 53, and Marianne Kabir, 56, were walking to pick up their sons from basketball practice.\n\n\"You can't even get to the high school,\" Bennett said.\n\nEarlier in the day, she'd tried to go for a run, only to find her usual trails underwater.\n\nKabir looked on the bright side. All the flooding had brought out a bevy of birds.\n\n\"It's really gorgeous,\" she said.\n\nAt Equator Coffee, farther down Almonte Boulevard, baristas fielded calls from customers wondering whether they could get to the shop. Julia Pfahl, 36, was picking up a morning coffee and chatting with baristas. She'd had to leave home much earlier than usual to get to work at Proof Lab Surf Shop. When she'd arrived at work, she'd found the shop under 4 inches of water.\n\n\"It's the worst I've ever seen it,\" she said, chuckling. \"Everyone is in a panic, no one knows how to drive in it - I saw a car by the Holiday Inn (on nearby Shoreline Highway) with water up to its windows. Did you really think you could drive through that?\"\n\nMeteorologists said another period of minor coastal flooding was expected late Sunday morning, though it will not be as severe as Saturday's water levels.\n\nTide levels will be about half a foot lower than Saturday's flooding, meteorologists said. By Monday, the coastal flood advisories are expected to drop off.\n\nThis article originally published at ‘Worst I've ever seen it': Bay Area flooding closes roads, strands motorists.",

    "fullText": "NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Kenyans are mourning the death of a beloved “super tusker” elephant whose long life in the wild came to symbolize the country's increasingly successful efforts to protect the mammals from ivory poachers.\n\nThe bull elephant who died on Saturday was named Craig. He lived in Amboseli National Park, a protected area in southern Kenya that is a favorite of safari tourists, the Kenya Wildlife Service said in a statement.\n\n“Craig, the legendary super tusker famed for its immense, ground-sweeping tusks and calm, dignified presence, passed on at the age of 54,\" the statement said.\n\nThe Amboseli Trust for Elephants said Craig had died of natural causes. The conservation group said it was grateful to everyone who worked to help the animal “live out his life naturally.”\n\nLocal broadcaster NTV aired a segment on the death of Craig, saying of the elephant that it was a rare creature as “one of the last remaining elephants identified as super tuskers in Africa.”\n\nThe term describes a bull elephant with tusks that weigh over 45 kilograms each. Tusks that size are so long that they scrape the ground as the elephant walks, according to the Tsavo Trust, a non-profit conservation group in Kenya. Females that grow long tusks are called iconic cows, the group says.\n\nIn Amboseli National Park, a protected area whose vegetation ranges from savannah woodland to open grasslands near the Tanzania border, Craig stood out as an attraction to tourists and a notable creature to conservationists working to protect elephants from poachers and other threats.\n\nThe elephant was said to be calm, “often pausing patiently as visitors photographed and filmed him,” the statement by Kenya Wildlife Service said.\n\nIn 2021, Craig was adopted by beer maker East African Breweries through its popular Tusker brand, reflecting his prominence but also underscoring collaboration between conservation groups and others in Kenya.\n\nKenya’s national parks and reserves are home to a variety of wildlife species and attract millions of visitors annually, making the country a tourism hotspot.\n\nThe elephant population has grown from 36,280 in 2021 to 42,072 in 2025, the latest official figures show.\n\nIn the Mwea National Reserve, a protected area east of the Kenyan capital of Nairobi, the elephant population grew spectacularly, overwhelming the ecosystem and requiring the relocation of about 100 elephants in 2024.\n\nThe African savanna elephant is the largest land animal. Adult males weigh about six tons. Craig “fathered a number of calves, ensuring that his powerful bloodline and gentle character live on across generations,\" the wildlife service said.\n\n___ Muhumuza reported from Kampala, Uganda.",

    "description": "William and Simone Butler were 1,200 miles off the Costa Rica coast when their boat sank",
    "fullText": "In 1989, a couple set out on a yachting adventure\n\nWilliam and Simone Butler were 1,200 miles off the Costa Rica coast when their boat sank\n\nFrom there, they took to a life raft — where they survived for 66 days adrift in the Pacific Ocean\n\nIt's a story fairly familiar to anyone who's followed orca activity in recent years: a couple was shipwrecked when their yacht was surrounded and sunk by a group of whales off the coast of Costa Rica. But what happened next was altogether different, with the two enduring 66 days adrift in the Pacific Ocean in a rubber raft, saved by a tiny device aptly named \"Survivor.\"\n\nWilliam and Simone Butler were three weeks into a journey attempting to circumnavigate the globe on their 40-foot yacht, roughly 1,200 miles off the coast, when they were sunk by whales on June 15, 1989.\n\nThe two scrambled to grab food, fishing gear and a 7-lb. pump called the \"Survivor-35\" — a manually operated pump that converts saltwater to fresh water — before getting into a rubber raft.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nThat quick thinking proved integral, as the two would be stuck in the raft for 66 days, adrift in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nFor more than two months, they subsisted mostly on raw fish and \"a precious three liters of potable water that William,\" then aged 60, squeezed out of the Survivor each day, per PEOPLE's reporting at the time.\n\nAt the end of the 66-day ordeal, William and Simone, then 52, were rescued by the Costa Rican Coast Guard and taken to a hospital in the coastal city of Golfito.\n\nDespite the odds, the two were in relatively good health (other than being dehydrated and severely sunburned). From his hospital bed, William told reporters they had caught fish daily, saying, \"I forced myself to eat almost 2 lbs. of raw fish a day, and I forced my wife to eat it too.\"\n\nEven with the fish, both William and Simone lost a reported 50 lbs. each during the ordeal.\n\nFollowing their recovery, the couple arrived back in the states, with William telling reporters, \"It's hard to believe that seven days ago we were still adrift, trying to make landfall. Really, it's hard to discuss the situation.\"\n\nThe couple said they fended off shark attacks and fish feeding frenzies during the ordeal and had been contacted about turning their story into a book or movie.\n\nBut in the aftermath, they were more content to stay on solid ground. \"We're going to rest - and go away from the ocean for a while, to the mountains, the prairies,\" William said at the time, per PEOPLE's reporting.\n\nPer an obituary, William died in June 2024, with his wife dying some years earlier.\n\nEven his obituary recounted his sailing adventures, which began at age 14, when \"he skippered his first blue water voyage from Havana to Varadero on his 15-foot Snipe.\"\n\n\"Bill went on to skipper countless voyages, including treasure hunting, fishing, three transatlantic voyages, rounding Cape Horn, and an attempted circumnavigation which ended when his sailboat Siboney was sunk by whales,\" the obituary read.\n\n\"Over the course of Bill's sailing years, he logged over 74,000 nautical miles at sea with his children, grandchildren, and numerous crewmembers aboard his two mistresses of the sea, Siboney and New Chance.\"",

    "description": "Brian Moynihan says the fears are understandable, but urges young grads not to lose hope about the job market.",
    "fullText": "Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan says the headlines about Gen Z’s fears about AI and the job market are real.\n\nThe bank recently hired 2,000 top grads from 200,000 applications, the executive said in an interview with CBS News‘ Margaret Brennan on Face the Nation. As companies cite AI for widespread layoffs, Moynihan acknowledges that many young people feel scared and uncertain about the future.\n\n“My advice to those kids, if you ask them if they’re worried about, they say they’re worried about—these are kids that we hire, 200,000 applications, we hire 2000 people.” Moynihan added that “if you ask them if they’re scared, they say they are. And I understand that. But I say, harness it … It’ll be your world ahead of you,” Moynihan said.\n\nMoynihan said it’s too soon to say how AI will play out in the job market, but he hopes to use efficiencies created by the technology to invest in more growth.\n\n“We want to drive more growth. So the AI will be spent—the efficiencies from AI will be spent to keep growing the company, I think,” he said.\n\nMoynihan also said Americans are focusing too much on the Fed and its impact on the economy. He argued that the private sector is a more important driver of economic growth.\n\n“The idea that we are, like, hanging on the thread by the Fed moving rates 25 basis points, it seems to me we’ve gotten out of whack,” he said.\n\nJerome Powell and multiple economists have validated that Gen Z is facing a genuine “hiring nightmare,” especially for recent college graduates trying to land their first white-collar job. This is tied to a low‑hire, low‑fire labor market, the rapid automation of entry‑level roles, and a tech industry whose workforce is getting older as Gen Z’s presence shrinks.\n\nIn September 2025, Powell used his post‑meeting press conference to highlight an “interesting labor market” where “kids coming out of college and younger people, minorities, are having a hard time finding jobs.” He emphasized that the job-finding rate is “very, very low” even as layoffs remain subdued, creating a stagnant low‑hiring, low‑firing environment that is particularly punishing for new entrants. Asked whether AI was to blame, he called it “probably a factor” but not the main driver, suggesting that slower overall job creation plus some AI substitution is squeezing young workers at precisely the moment they try to get on the ladder.\n\nEmployers are using AI to automate the predictable, process‑heavy tasks that once justified many junior roles, especially in corporate and tech settings. Platforms that track early‑career hiring, like Handshake, point to a double squeeze: entry‑level job postings in corporate roles are down roughly 15% year over year, while references to “AI” in job descriptions have jumped about 400% over two years. Economists like Dartmouth’s David Blanchflower tell Fortune that even when young people do find work, they report rising “despair” and a pervasive “this job sucks” sentiment, compounding the effect of higher recent‑grad unemployment rates compared with the national average.",

    "fullText": "A baffled reporter shouted out after President Donald Trump spent 20 minutes rambling at a press conference on his strike and capture of President Nicolás Maduro, asking him to “explain” himself.\n\nNews broke after midnight Friday that the United States struck Venezuela’s capital of Caracas early Saturday morning, and at 4:21 AM, Trump announced on Truth Social that Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores were captured and flown to the United States.\n\nTrump spoke at a  press conference in Florida Saturday morning, during which he opened with a wandering opening statement that included the repeated claim that “we’re going to run the country.”\n\nWhen he tossed to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, a reporter tried to circle back to that claim:\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We knocked out 97 percent. And those drugs mostly come from a place called Venezuela. We’re going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper, and judicious transition.\n\nSo we don’t want to be involved with having somebody else get in, and we have the same situation that we had for the last long period of years. So we are going to run the country until such time as we could do a safe, proper and judicous transition.\n\nAnd it has to be judicious, because that’s what we’re all about. We want peace, liberty, and justice for the great people of Venezuela, and that includes many from Venezuela that are now living in the United States and want to go back to their country, it’s their homeland.\n\nWe can’t take a chance if somebody else takes over Venezuela that doesn’t have the good of the Venezuelan people in mind. Decades of that. We’re not going to let that happen.\n\nWe are there now, and what people don’t understand, but they understand as I say this, we’re there now. But we’re going to stay until such time as the proper transition can take place.\n\nSo we’re gonna stay until such time, we are gonna run it essentially until such a time as a proper transition can take place.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Thank you very much.\n\nREPORTER: Can you explain how the US will run Venezuela?\n\nThe post Baffled Reporter Shouts Out After Rambling Trump Weave On Blockbuster Strike: ‘Can You Explain…’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "Cynthia Diekema, 61, was killed by an alligator while on a canoe ride with her husband in Florida last year",
    "fullText": "Cynthia Diekema, 61, was canoeing with her husband last year when they crashed into an alligator in their canoe and both fell into the water, according to a report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission recently obtained by PEOPLE\n\nThroughout the attack, he said that his wife seemed alert, but unable to speak and had a \"puzzled look on her face\"\n\nHer cause of death was listed as “multiple blunt force injuries from an alligator,\" according to the report.\n\nNew details have emerged about an alligator attack that claimed the life of a 61-year-old woman as her husband fought to save her life.\n\nOn May 6, around 4:02 p.m. local time, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission responded to an alligator encounter near the mouth of Tiger Creek in Polk County.\n\nThe woman, later identified as Cynthia Diekema, was canoeing with her husband when they encountered the reptile and both fell into the water, the FWC later shared.\n\nThe 11-foot, 4-inch alligator then bit Cynthia and pulled her into the water before she was \"later found deceased.\"\n\nNearly eight months after the attack, an incident summary report from the FWC, which was obtained by PEOPLE via a public records request, revealed additional information about what happened on that horrifying day.\n\nIn a sworn statement to authorities, David Diekema, Cynthia’s husband, said that he and his wife were traveling on an 11-foot plastic canoe that departed earlier that day from Lake Kissimmee State Park.\n\nOnce they entered the shallow waters of Tiger Creek, David says that they observed numerous alligators — and right before the attack, his wife commented on how they were \"about to go right over top of one,\" according to the report.\n\nAs the canoe crashed into the animal, which was resting on the bottom of the creek, the startled animal began to thrash, according to the report, which caused the canoe to capsize and sent the couple into the water.\n\nWhen he was able to stand up, David said he saw Cynthia’s torso in the alligator’s mouth.\n\nAccording to officials, he said he \"attempted to free her from the alligator's mouth for several minutes,\" but was unsuccessful.\n\nThroughout the ordeal, he said that his wife seemed alert, but unable to speak and had a \"puzzled look on her face.\"\n\nAt one point, the alligator whipped its tail, knocking David off of his feet, according to the report. During that time, he also said the alligator \"momentarily released\" his wife before biting her again on the shoulder.\n\nAfter regaining his balance, he tried once again to free his wife from the alligator's mouth, however the alligator then \"conducted a death roll and immediately swam away with Mrs. Diekema in its mouth.\"\n\nKnowing that time was of the essence, David — who lost his phone during the ordeal — bailed as much water as he could from the canoe and paddled north of Tiger Creek until he reached Lake Kissimmee, per the report. There he was rescued by a good Samaritan in an airboat.\n\nAbout 20 minutes into their search, the FWC recovered Cynthia's body and EMS pronounced her dead at the scene. The alligator was captured and euthanized around 7:30 p.m. local time that same day.\n\nA coroner later performed an autopsy and shared their findings with the FWC, detailing numerous injuries, including the amputation of her right arm below the shoulder.\n\nThey stated that the preliminary cause of Cynthia’s death was “multiple blunt force injuries from an alligator” and the manner of death was ruled as an “accident,\" according to the report.\n\nThe day after the incident, investigators returned to the scene to find any other alligators that were involved in the attack and to capture those that are potentially dangerous in the Tiger Creek area. One alligator was dispatched by an officer and moved onto an airboat bound for Kissimmee Park. No other gators were located.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\n“The FWC extends its deepest sympathies to the family and friends of the victim during this difficult time,” the department said in a previous statement.\n\nCynthia was from Paw Paw, Mich., and is survived by her husband David, two children and two grandchildren, per her obituary.\n\n\"She radiated her inner and outer beauty in all she did and had unconditional love for everyone,\" the obituary read. \"She cherished her family and every moment and adventure they spent together.\"",

    "description": "Embattled Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan, who was convicted of obstruction last month for helping an immigrant evade federal officers, has sent her resignation letter to the governor.  A spokesperson for Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, said his office received Dugan's letter, and he would work to fill the vacancy without delay.

    "fullText": "Embattled Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan, who was convicted of obstruction last month for helping an immigrant evade federal officers, has sent her resignation letter to the governor.\n\nThe letter was sent Saturday. Republicans had been making plans to impeach her ever since her Dec. 19 conviction. A spokesperson for Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, said his office received Dugan's letter, and he would work to fill the vacancy without delay.\n\nDugan wrote that over the past decade she handled thousands of cases with “a commitment to treat all persons with dignity and respect, to act justly, deliberately and consistently, and to maintain a courtroom with the decorum and safety the public deserves.”\n\nBut she said the case against her is too big of a distraction.\n\n“As you know, I am the subject of unprecedented federal legal proceedings, which are far from concluded but which present immense and complex challenges that threaten the independence of our judiciary. I am pursuing this fight for myself and for our independent judiciary,” Dugan said in her letter.\n\nLast April, federal prosecutors accused Dugan of distracting federal officers trying to arrest a Mexican immigrant outside her courtroom and leading the man out through a private door. A federal jury convicted her of felony obstruction.\n\nThe case against Dugan was highlighted by President Donald Trump as he pressed ahead with his sweeping immigration crackdown. Democrats insisted the administration was trying to make an example of Dugan to blunt judicial opposition to the operation.\n\nRepublican Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos praised Dugan's decision.\n\n“I’m glad Dugan did the right thing by resigning and followed the clear direction from the Wisconsin Constitution,\" Vos said.\n\nDemocrat Ann Jacobs, who is chair of the Wisconsin Elections Commission board, said she agreed with Dugan that Milwaukee should have a permanent judge in place while this fight plays out.\n\n“Despite her situation, she is ever the champion of justice, wanting to remove the judiciary from a political battle over her fate. I’m sure this is terribly hard for her but she is true to her faith and her principles,” Jacobs said in a post on X.\n\nOn April 18, immigration officers went to the Milwaukee County courthouse after learning 31-year-old Eduardo Flores-Ruiz had reentered the country illegally and was scheduled to appear before Dugan for a hearing in a state battery case.\n\nDugan confronted agents outside her courtroom and directed them to the office of her boss, Milwaukee County Chief Judge Carl Ashley, because she told them their administrative warrant wasn’t sufficient grounds to arrest Flores-Ruiz.\n\nAfter the agents left, she led Flores-Ruiz and his attorney out a private jury door. Agents spotted Flores-Ruiz in the corridor, followed him outside and arrested him after a foot chase. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced in November he had been deported.",

    "description": "The world may no longer fully live in the grip of COVID-19, but another heavily contagious disease is currently spreading through U.S. airports.",
    "fullText": "In 2020, COVID-19 caused travel restrictions and other changes to how people get around. Avoiding getting sick while traveling is tricky, as COVID-19, flu, and common colds easily spread when dozens of people sit shoulder to shoulder inside planes, trains, or buses. However, another disease has added itself to the list. Measles is on the rise, and health officials have detected it in airports.\n\nThe New Jersey Department of Health sent a press release stating that it detected measles in a traveler who was at the Newark Liberty International Airport on December 12, 2025. The department has undertaken contact tracing efforts in case the passenger infected others. Another case appeared in a passenger who flew to and from Boston Logan International Airport (one of the busiest in the country) on December 11 and 12.\n\nThe Massachusetts Department of Public Health sent a press release of its own. The press release emphasized that measles is preventable through vaccines, making the nationwide rise in cases all the more surprising. Per the Centers for Disease Control, over 2,000 people in the U.S. tested positive for measles in 2025, numbers not seen since 1992.\n\nGavi, an organization working to increase medical vaccine access worldwide, explained that measles is the most contagious virus based on how many others just one person can infect, a measurement called R0. Like COVID-19 and the flu, measles spreads through particles in the air after someone carrying the disease coughs or sneezes. Its particles also linger in the air for up to two hours, meaning you can catch measles even without direct contact. After around two centuries of documented measles existence, researchers created a vaccine in the 1960s.\n\nVaccine skeptics have long existed around the world, but recent years have seen a higher percentage of parents choosing not to vaccinate their children. Gavi attributes this to vaccine misinformation, the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, and other global crises. Multiple health officials have publicly tried to ease people's minds by stating that vaccines are safe and effective as long as enough members of a population receive them.\n\nGetting measles despite being vaccinated is incredibly uncommon, but all travelers can take solace in the fact that cases are still fairly low nationwide. If you think you might be sick, wearing a mask can prevent you from spreading anything.\n\nReady to discover more hidden gems and expert travel tips?

    "description": "As impressive as the teams of developers that create games are, sometimes I am more blown away by the passion of the communities that build up around them, and what comes out of them. As more and more games are being made with software that is more available for general public use, like Unreal Engine, Blender, and Unity, this means that fans are able to try their hand at making custom creations to add into their favorite games, or even full-blown tools that help others do so.\nFrom clever randomizers to giant adjustments to the base game, these are some of the best fan mods and creations released in 2025.",
    "fullText": "on January 3, 2026 at 12:00PM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nAs impressive as the teams of developers that create games are, sometimes I am more blown away by the passion of the communities that build up around them, and what comes out of them. As more and more games are being made with software that is more available for general public use, like Unreal Engine, Blender, and Unity, this means that fans are able to try their hand at making custom creations to add into their favorite games, or even full-blown tools that help others do so.\n\nFrom clever randomizers to giant adjustments to the base game, these are some of the best fan mods and creations released in 2025.\n\nWhile the Castlevania: Symphony of the Night randomizer isn't anything new, what modder Mottzilla has managed to do is on another level: It's an integrated randomizer inside the game itself. This randomizer comes with various presets and options to let you customize your randomized experience of SotN, letting you swap around where abilities are, starting items, and more, without having the need to create and download a new seed every time you want to play. As an extra bonus, this mod will also work on original hardware, including PSX and PS2 systems, so long as you have a way to play backups. Enjoy Castlevania: Symphony of the Night in a new way, every time you play with this mod!\n\nWhile Metal Gear Solid 3 Delta may be the hot new Snake on the block, that doesn't mean that earlier versions of that classic game haven't gotten some love too this year. Metal Gear Solid 3 in the Master Collection Vol. 1 has received a randomizer mod courtesy of Great0ne. This randomizer shakes up your typical MGS3 playthrough by changing every pickup, including weapons, items, medic supplies, camo, and food, with some other options like random vomit or fake death being possible should you wish. This is a great way to really test those Big Boss skills of yours and whether or not you deserve the title.\n\nKeeping on the randomizer train, one of the more popular ways to play these sorts of mods is via a unique interconnected method known as Archipelago. This multi-world mod/community has developed ways to tether and let people play multiple different games together, where you can pick up items from a completely different game that someone else in your group is playing, and vice versa. As an example, someone could be playing Pokemon Red and get rewarded with the Super Metroid Morph Ball for beating a gym, letting the person playing Super Metroid now have access to the upgrade. With new games being added all the time to the pool of options and larger groups teaming up to tackle games together, 2025 marked the best year yet for Archipelago.\n\nWith a passionate team of almost 40 fans and organized by prominent fighting game YouTuber and streamer Maximilian Dood, this massive mod for Marvel Vs. Capcom Infinite overhauls the visuals of the 2017 fighter, giving it a gorgeous comic book look, updates movesets, new outfits, new music, and even adds in a brand-new four-player game mode. This passion project is a must-have for any MVC fans.\n\nCombining the first three Mega Man X games on the Super Nintendo into a single game, the Route MatriX Randomizer lets you jump between the three to search for armor pieces, weapons, upgrades, and access to new levels. Your goal is to defeat all three versions of Sigma, but first, you will need to discover the keys to his levels. For fans of these classic action platformers, the Route MatriX randomizer is an impressive new way to play.\n\nWhile each mod is its own, this slot is actually four mods in one. Created by theadamrippon, this gives the DX color treatment to the original three Final Fantasy Legend games and Final Fantasy Adventure, which were all released on the original Game Boy back in the early '90s. While labeled Final Fantasy Legend in the West, these were actually the original three SaGa entries, with Adventure being the original Mana game, both of which would go on and grow as their own beloved series over the decades, with new releases still coming out today. These beautiful mods present the original games in color, making them really pop.\n\nOblivion's companions are neat and all, but wouldn't it be cooler if you could hang out around Cyrodiil with a bear or one of those annoying mudcrabs? Mod creator Shadedness thinks so, and thus their \"Beast Mastery - Tame Beast Pets - Permanent Summons\" mod was born for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered. With this installed, not only will you have some fuzzy friends tagging along on your adventures, but you will be able to command them to a limited extent, feeding them to gain better buffs with them, and even level them up. Now get out there and get yourself a mountain lion.\n\nDesigned around the \"legacy\" philosophy whose goal is to make the perfect version of a game, TheSmithPlays created this mod to help do just that for Fire Emblem 7: The Blazing Blade. It was the first Fire Emblem game to come to the West, where it was referred to simply as Fire Emblem. Fire Emblem Legacy tweaks stages, weapon effectiveness, characters, and a host of other aspects of the classic title, resulting in a product that feels like how we remember Fire Emblem being when American audiences first met Eliwood, Lynn, and Hector back in 2003.\n\nThe tale of Cecil Harvey's redemption and struggle against Zeromus has made Final Fantasy IV one of the most beloved entries in Square's legendary franchise, but one thing it has always been missing is a job system. Thankfully, modder S34n4e has rectified this omission with the release of Final Fantasy 4 - Job System, a mod that adds 14 discoverable jobs that give you more flexibility with your party. Each job comes complete with a unique sprite, attributes, abilities, and more to make each one feel worthwhile, resulting in a wildly new-feeling FFIV.\n\nThe Monster Hunter series has always opted to hide numbers from players, such as boss health, stat build-up, and more. This year's Monster Hunter Wilds continues that approach, but this overlay mod pulls back the curtain and gives you all the stats and data you want to help you coordinate your hunts and strategies with your friends.\n\nThe right track can elevate moments from being exciting to legendary, and this mod from BRYN4444 for Dragon Ball Sparking Zero adds in more than 200 tracks from the Japanese release of the anime and films. Now you can hurl beams and clash with your friends to your favorite tunes from the anime. A similar mod is also available that adds tracks from previous DBZ games if that is more your style.\n\nPokemon Lazarus by Nemo622 is a complete overhaul mod of Pokemon Emerald that features a brand-new region based on Greece--the Illos Region--among many other new goodies to discover, such as a hard mode, a day/night system, and minigames. For trainers looking for more Pokemon goodness after finishing ZA, Pokemon Lazarus is a masterclass in Pokemon fan mods.\n\nThe long-awaited Hollow Knight expansion-turned-sequel, Silksong, finally released this year and has delighted (and infuriated) fans with its tight platforming and tough challenges. In this mod created by XvX, two players can play through the game together, with a cool new revive mechanic that lets you heal your teammate if they go down. Sometimes it's nice to suffer together with a friend.\n\nFrom Software's souls-likes are great fun when playing with friends, and this year's Elden Ring Nightreign highlights this fact better than any other. Created by a user named Yui, the Seamless Co-op mod allows up to six players to play together (up from the official max of two or three) and see each other in the Roundtable Hold. It can also adjust enemy scaling to make runs easier or more challenging.\n\nBack when Starfield came out in 2023, in our review, we found that despite its satisfying gunplay and some captivating quest lines, it struggled to deliver a memorable RPG that lives up to the studio's pedigree. Leave it to the passion of the Bethesda modding community, though, to put together mind-blowing, awesome mods--enter Star Wars Genesis. This total conversion modlist, which recently got its eleventh update of the year and which we featured on our list of the best Starfield mods, continues to mold Starfield into what could end up being the best Star Wars RPG out there. With custom storylines, bosses, dungeons, armor, weapons, and more, Star Wars Genesis just continues getting better.\n\nSuper Metroid: X-Fusion from Metaquarium and team feels like an artifact pulled straight out of another reality, one where Metroid Fusion was released on the SNES and was far more difficult. This impressive mod is a total overhaul of Super Metroid, combining aspects of both it and its portable sequel into an all-new retelling of the Fusion story. With cutscenes, new bosses, new areas, and redone Fusion bosses, just to name a few of its features, X-Fusion is an ideal option for Metroid aficionados looking for a challenge.\n\nReleased back in July, The Final Empire update for Anbennar--a fantasy total-conversion mod for Europa Versalis IV--brought with it a host of new features and goodies. Special to The Final Empire itself are new mission trees, religions, and a custom UI to add even more personality to this project. If the idea of adding elements of the epic fantasy genre into Europa Versalis--including schools of magic, a world rich in its own lore, and races including orcs, elves, and dwarves--then Anbennar is the mod for you.\n\nThe updated release of Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles marks the first time in quite a while that players can easily play this tactical RPG masterpiece, and its debut on PC. Being based on the original PSX release, some things were lost that had been introduced in the PSP remake, including the Dark and Onion Knight jobs. Luckily, those jobs are missing no more thanks to TriggerHappy's mod, bringing them back in, complete with their PSP sprites. This mod also adds a page system to the Job menu, which will hopefully allow for new jobs to get added in down the road. Either way, you will now be able to once again add these powerful professions to your roster of heroes.\n\nMany RPGs used to never be localized for Western markets, one of which was the PS2 remake of Sega's original Phantasy Star. This mod is a full retranslation of the original 2012 translation patch that fixes various errors and updates some terms to be \n\nKingdom Come Deliverance 2 from Warhorse Studios is perhaps one of the most immersive and complex RPGs that was released in 2025, but one divisive mechanic was its save system, which Unlimited Saving 2 addresses. Normally, in order to save, players need to craft Savior Schnapps items that would be consumed upon saving. This godsend of a mod by EddieShoe removes the need to spend these items to save, making KCD2 far more welcoming to try out different approaches and gameplay styles without the risk of burning through resources. And, to sweeten the deal even more, using this mod doesn't lock you out from earning achievements, so save to your medieval heart's content!",

    "fullText": "Senators and House members accuse Trump and his aides of disregarding the Constitution and lying to Congress.\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced on Truth Social on Saturday at 3:21 am, “The United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the Country. This operation was done in conjunction with U.S. Law Enforcement. Details to follow.”\n\nHours later, during a congratulatory press conference, Trump said that during a period of transition in Venezuela, “we’re going to run the country right.” But he gave only limited details of how the process would proceed, aside from saying, “We’re not afraid of boots on the ground.” Trump dwelt more on talk of prosecuting Maduro and his wife in a New York City courtroom.\n\nUS Attorney General Pam Bondi had already taken to social media earlier on Saturday morning with a message :“Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, have been indicted in the Southern District of New York. Nicolas Maduro has been charged with Narco-Terrorism Conspiracy, Cocaine Importation Conspiracy, Possession of Machineguns and Destructive Devices, and Conspiracy to Possess Machineguns and Destructive Devices against the United States. They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts.”\n\nBut in a brief predawn call with a New York Times reporter, Trump refused to discuss whether “he had sought congressional authority for the operation or what is next for Venezuela.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio later acknowledged that there had been no pre-attack consultation.\n\nAs it became clear that leaders of the Senate and House Armed Services committees had not been consulted on the regime-change attack and as confusion mounted about what would happen next in Venezuela, key members of Congress—who have the constitutionally defined authority to declare wars and to oversee major military actions—reacted angrily to what had transpired in the name of the United States but without the consent of the legislative branch.\n\n“A US invasion of Venezuela to depose its president and arrest him is illegal,” Tim Kaine, a Democratic senator from Virginia, told NPR Saturday morning. Kaine promised to seek a Senate vote next week to declare that Trump should not be waging this “unilateral presidentially declared war against Venezuela” without congressional authorization.\n\nKaine, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, issued a statement arguing, “President Trump’s unauthorized military attack on Venezuela to arrest Maduro—however terrible he is—is a return to a day when the United States asserted a right to dominate the internal affairs of all nations in the Western Hemisphere. The history is replete with failures, and doubling down on it makes it difficult to the claim with a straight face to other countries should respect the United States’ sovereignty when we do not do the same.”\n\n“Where will this go next?” asked Kaine. “Will the President deploy our troops to protect Iranian protesters? To enforce the fragile ceasefire in Gaza? To battle terrorists in Nigeria? To seize Greenland or the Panama Canal? To suppress Americans peacefully assembling to protest his policies? Trump has threatened to do all this and more and sees no need to seek legal authorization from people’s elected legislature before putting servicemembers at risk.”\n\nRepresentative Mark Pocan, a Wisconsin Democrat who has been one of the House’s most consistent critics of undeclared wars, warned that Trump has disregarded the Constitution. “President Trump has repeatedly been told he must consult with and get authorization from Congress to go to war, per US law. While we are only seeing early public accounts of what happened, it is clear he acted without doing that,” Pocan said. “Trump not notifying Democratic leadership, much less rank-and-file members, continues the degradation of the rule of law.”\n\nRepresentative James Walkinshaw, a Virginia Democrat who serves on the Military and Foreign Affairs Subcommittee of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Affairs, said, “Trump’s regime change war in Venezuela is flat out illegal and yet another betrayal of the commitments he made to the American people. He said he’d lower prices. He’s driving prices up. He said no ‘new stupid wars.’ He’s starting new stupid wars.”\n\nRepublican Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) initially went on social media and wrote, “I look forward to learning what, if anything, might constitutionally justify this action in the absence of a declaration of war or authorization for the use of military force.”\n\nLater, after receiving a call from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Lee made feeble excuses for the administration, claiming that the assault “likely” was justified by fears of “an actual or imminent attack.” But Washington Post national security analyst Josh Rogan wrote, “The United States has just kidnapped a foreign head of state and bombed a foreign capital using the justification of protecting U.S. personnel from an ‘actual or imminent attack’ according to Senator Lee. Make no mistake, President Trump just committed an act of war against Venezuela.”\n\nThe New York Times adopted a similar view in an editorial headlined “Trump’s Attack on Venezuela Is Illegal and Unwise.”\n\nAnd Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) dismissed claims by the president and the attorney general about the reasons for the regime change. “It’s not about drugs. If it was, Trump wouldn’t have pardoned one of the largest narco traffickers in the world [former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández] last month. It’s about oil and regime change. And they need a trial now to pretend that it isn’t. Especially to distract from Epstein + skyrocketing healthcare costs.”\n\nRepresentative Thomas Massie (R-KY) also expressed skepticism. “If this action were constitutionally sound,” Massie wrote on X, “the Attorney General wouldn’t be tweeting that they’ve arrested the President of a sovereign country and his wife for possessing guns in violation of a 1934 U.S. firearm law.”\n\nMaduro, according to election observers, almost certainly lost the 2024 presidential election and then refused to step down. Yet he had recently signaled an openness to meeting with Trump to discuss US allegations about drug trafficking and other issues. Trump has now executed a secret plan to remove the Venezuelan leader, even after Trump’s aides had denied regime-change plans.\n\nSenator Andy Kim, a New Jersey Democrat who served as a national security adviser under President Barack Obama, accused Trump’s secretaries of state and defense of lying to Congress about the administration’s intensions. “Secretaries Rubio and Hegseth looked every Senator in the eye a few weeks ago and said this wasn’t about regime change,” Kim said in a statement amid the first reports of US air strikes on Caracas. “I didn’t trust them then and we see now that they blatantly lied to Congress. Trump rejected our Constitutionally required approval process for armed conflict because the Administration knows the American people overwhelmingly reject risks pulling our nation into another war.”\n\nKim explained, “This strike doesn’t represent strength. It’s not sound foreign policy. It puts Americans at risk in Venezuela and the region, and it sends a horrible and disturbing signal to other powerful leaders across the globe that targeting a head of state is an acceptable policy for the U.S. government. This will further damage our reputation—already hurt by Trump’s policies around the world—and only isolate us in a time when we need our friends and allies more than ever.”\n\nSenator Brian Schatz, a Hawaii Democrat who is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said, “We have no vital national interests in Venezuela to justify war. We should have learned not to stumble into another stupid adventure by now.”\n\nSenator Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat who served in the US Marines from 2002 to 2006 and was deployed during the war in Iraq, bluntly declared, “This war is illegal.” “There is no justification for the United States to be at war with Venezuela. I lived through the consequences of an illegal war sold to the American people with lies,” explained Gallego. “We swore we would never repeat those mistakes. Yet here we are again. The American people did not ask for this, Congress did not authorize this, and our service members should not be sent into harm’s way for another unnecessary conflict.”",

    "title": "What the top US general revealed about how the surprise 'Absolute Resolve' raid to capture Maduro unfolded in Venezuela",
    "description": "Operation Absolute Resolve involved over 150 military aircraft, including fighter jets, helicopters, drones, and bomber planes.",
    "fullText": "More than 150 US military aircraft participated in the operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, including fighter jets, drones, bombers, and helicopters, the top US general said on Saturday.\n\nDan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that the \"audacious\" mission to extract Maduro — called \"Absolute Resolve\" — required months of meticulous planning and rehearsal, and involved forces from across the US military.\n\nCaine, speaking in Florida alongside President Donald Trump and other senior administration officials, said the US intelligence agencies spent months trying to find Maduro and map out various elements and patterns of his life. There were also detailed rehearsals, including the building of a replica of Maduro's compound, an approach the US applied to the 2011 Osama bin Laden raid.\n\nThere were limits to what Caine could share, but he was still able to provide substantial detail.\n\nShortly before 11 p.m. ET on Friday night, after waiting several days for favorable weather, Trump ordered US forces to proceed with the extraction operation.\n\nCaine said that during the \"darkest hours\" of the night, aircraft launched from 20 different bases, on land and at sea, across the Western Hemisphere.\n\nHelicopters carrying the US apprehension teams, including law enforcement officers and special operations forces, took off and flew to Venezuela, flying around 100 feet above the water.\n\nAs they approached the shores, military forces established a path forward, while Marine, Navy, and Air Force planes protected them from above. The US targeted Venezuelan military installations and defenses. Trump also shared that the military effectively turned off the lights using \"certain expertise.\" The darkness aided the infiltration.\n\nThe American aircraft included a mix of F-35 and F-22 stealth fighter jets, as well as F/A-18 fighter jets, EA-18 electronic attack jets, E-2 airborne early warning planes, B-1 bombers, and other unnamed support aircraft, as well as \"numerous\" drones, Caine said.\n\nAs the interdiction forces out to bag Maduro approached Caracas, the aircraft began to strike Venezuela's air defenses to ensure a safe passageway for the helicopters flying at low altitudes. Trump acknowledged that US military action had been telegraphed in advance, so the air defenses were ready. They were, however, met with a significant response.\n\n\"Those in the air over Caracas last night were willing to give their lives for those on the ground and in the helicopters,\" Caine said of the planes providing air cover.\n\nUS strikes and other layered effects, Caine said, helped ensure the forces pushing into downtown Caracas had \"totally the element of surprise.\"\n\nThe helicopters carrying the extraction team arrived at Maduro's compound shortly after 1 a.m. ET and took heavy fire. The apprehension force stormed the facility and took the Venezuelan president and his wife into custody. Trump said that they attempted to make it into a steel safe room but were unable to get the door closed.\n\nAmerican forces then withdrew from the country, with fighters and drones covering the exfiltration. By roughly 3:30 a.m. ET, US forces were over the water.\n\nThey flew Maduro and his wife to the amphibious assault ship USS Iwo Jima. Trump later published a photo of the Venezuelan president aboard the ship, where he was seen wearing a blindfold and ear protection while holding a bottle of water.\n\nUS officials said that there were no equipment or troop losses; however, Trump said earlier that \"a couple of guys were hit\" during the raid. The Pentagon and White House did not respond to questions for additional details on injuries to American personnel. A helicopter was also hit \"pretty hard,\" Trump said, but it remained flyable.\n\nThe scale and coordination of what Trump called a \"very complex\" operation resemble those of the June 2025 strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities, which also involved dozens of US military aircraft, with officials underscoring the key element of surprise.\n\nThe US established a significant military presence in the Caribbean Sea in recent months, including warships and aircraft. Troops, planes, and other assets have been very active, and the Trump administration has been repeatedly threatening to strike Venezuela, accusing the country's leadership of facilitating drug trafficking, among other criminal activity. Maduro rejected these claims.\n\nThe US has carried out dozens of strikes against alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, killing more than 100 people in a campaign that drew criticism from legal experts and lawmakers. The US stopped short of hitting targets inside Venezuela, at least until a recent CIA operation.\n\nThe significant operation on Saturday marks a major escalation and throws into question the future of Venezuela's leadership. Trump said the US is going to \"run the country\" until it can ensure a safe transition of power, while also encouraging American oil companies to become involved in the Venezuelan oil industry.\n\nMeanwhile, Attorney General Pamela Bondi said Maduro has been indicted in the Southern District of New York and charged with various drug-related offenses.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump revealed key details of the US military assault on Venezuela during a press conference on Saturday.\n\nFrom Mar-a-Lago in Florida, Trump addressed the operation, including the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, who have been indicted by a US federal court.\n\nHere's what Trump said about the mission, the capture of the Venezuelan leader, and what comes next.\n\nTrump called the operation against Venezuelan leadership, which occurred overnight and into the early morning, \"an extraordinary military operation\" involving the use of assets and weapons across air, land, and sea domains. Other officials revealed that intelligence, space, and cyber assets were involved as well.\n\nDuring the press conference, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine said the apprehension mission, called Absolute Resolve, involved over 150 aircraft, including fighter jets, bombers, electronic warfare planes, intelligence and surveillance aircraft, helicopters, and drones.\n\nSome assets disabled Venezuelan defenses and provided cover, while others were involved in infiltration and extraction.\n\nThe US president said that the assault targeted \"a heavily fortified military fortress in the heart of Caracas,\" where Maduro was captured during the night. He added that the US used \"certain expertise\" to turn off the lights in Caracas and that the Venezuelan military was overwhelmed by US forces.\n\nAmong the most important discussion points of the president's press conference is that the US will run Venezuela \"until such time as we can do a safe, proper, and judicious transition.\"\n\nExactly how the Trump administration plans to do this, and for how long, remains unknown. By law, Maduro's vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, should assume power. Trump added that Rodríguez \"really doesn't have a choice\" but to accept US involvement.\n\nWhen speaking on who would be in charge of this plan, Trump pointed to the officials standing behind him at the conference, including Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy and homeland security advisor, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Caine.\n\nAdditionally, Trump said, the biggest US oil companies will be going to Venezuela to \"spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country.\"\n\nVenezuela is home to the world's largest proven crude oil reserves. The US has been seizing and blockading oil tankers in recent months as part of the escalating tension between Maduro and the Trump administration. Trump has said the US built Venezuela's oil industry and intends to take it back, accusing Caracas of using the money to fund narco-terrorism and other criminal activities.\n\nDuring the conference, Trump said the US was ready to conduct a second attack, \"a much bigger wave,\" on Venezuela if needed.\n\n\"We actually assumed that a second wave would be necessary, but now it's probably not,\" the president said, pointing to the success of the first attack.",

This increased production could push already-depressed crude oil prices even lower.\n\nAs shown in the chart below, crude oil has fallen sharply since the start of last year.\n\nAny US companies that start drilling in Venezuela will face a catch-22: The more oil they add to the world's existing surplus, the further prices will fall, and the less profit they'll reap for their drilling efforts.\n\nHow they decide to proceed will ultimately shape the price of oil — and what normal consumers pay to live their lives.",

    "description": "New imagery obtained by Business Insider shows widespread damage at a military complex in the southern part of Caracas.",
    "fullText": "New satellite imagery shows damage at a military facility in Caracas after the US carried out strikes as part of a surprise operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nThe new imagery, captured on Saturday by the US spatial intelligence firm Vantor and obtained by Business Insider, shows damage around the Venezuelan military complex at Fuerte Tiuna in the southern part of Caracas.\n\nFuerte Tiuna is a critical military installation in Venezuela. It houses defense ministries and major commands, official residences, and other major strategic infrastructure. It was a primary target of the US mission.\n\nThe new imagery reveals significant damage to military storage buildings and equipment at the complex, including several vehicles, as well as destroyed security buildings at a gate to the facility.\n\nPresident Donald Trump revealed earlier on Saturday that the US carried out a highly complex raid to capture Maduro and extract him from the country to face drug-related charges in New York. The White House in August had placed a $50 million bounty on his head.\n\nThe bold operation began late Friday night and continued into the early hours of the next day, with US military aircraft — including fighter jets, surveillance planes, bombers, and drones — striking Venezuela's air defenses to clear a path for apprehension forces to locate Maduro.\n\nVenezuela's government said US forces targeted military and civilian areas and strongly condemned the strikes. Video footage shared on social media showed helicopters above Caracas, with large explosions and plumes of smoke rising from the city.\n\nDan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters in Florida that the apprehension team, which included US law enforcement officers, broke into Maduro's fortified compound under heavy fire and took the Venezuelan president and his wife into custody.\n\nSeveral American personnel were injured in the raid, Trump revealed, and one helicopter took a hit. However, no one was killed, he said, and the US didn't lose any equipment. Maduro was flown to the US Navy amphibious assault ship USS Iwo Jima ahead of his transfer to New York.\n\nThe mission — dubbed \"Operation Absolute Resolve\" — followed months of escalating tensions between Trump and the Maduro regime and dozens of US military strikes against alleged narcotics-smuggling boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific.\n\nPrior to the mission, the US had established a large military presence around the Caribbean, and Trump had repeatedly threatened to pursue targets in Venezuela.\n\nCaine said that the audacious operation involved months of meticulous planning and rehearsal. That included building a replica of Maduro's compound, similar to what US special operations forces did ahead of the 2011 Osama bin Laden raid.\n\nThe operation on Saturday marks a significant escalation in the Trump administration's pressure campaign, which also saw the US seize Venezuela-linked oil tankers while imposing a naval blockade targeting sanctioned vessels.\n\nThe strikes raise questions about the future of Venezuela's leadership. Trump said the US will run the country\" until it can ensure a safe transition of power, although it's unclear how Washington will do that.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has been encouraging American oil companies to become involved in the Venezuelan oil industry.\n\nSome world leaders have reacted strongly to the operation, including some from countries near Venezuela, who criticized the mission. They were joined by some Democratic US lawmakers. Many Republicans voiced their support.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio explained to reporters in Florida on Saturday that the Trump administration did not notify Congress ahead of the operation and only informed members afterward. The president defended the decision.",

    "description": "A mother describes how her family was stranded in Puerto Rico after flight cancellations following the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Nilgen Velazco. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI woke up at 9 am on Saturday, January 3rd, thinking I'd start rushing around to get our family ready for our return flight to Colorado. My husband, Malcolm, and our two children, ages 8 and 4, have been in Camuy, Puerto Rico, visiting my family since December 12th and were due to leave today at 4 p.m. from San Juan.\n\nGroggy-eyed, I looked at my phone and saw I had an email from our airline — our flight had been canceled.\n\nMy mother, with whom we are staying, turned on the news, and that's when we saw what had happened in Venezuela while we had still been sleeping.\n\nI genuinely thought it must all be a dream.\n\nWhen Malcolm and I started planning this Christmas trip to Puerto Rico to visit my family — the first time we've ever done it — we'd had issues finding and booking flights because of the government shutdown.\n\nOnce we arrived, we had no idea that it would be an issue getting back home to Colorado. Things were stirring in Venezuela, an unfolding story I keep up with as my dad is Venezuelan, but we didn't think this would impact our trip in any way. It wasn't even on our radar.\n\nWe were completely shocked by the news this morning.\n\nI immediately got on the phone to try transferring our flights to another day. The person I was on the phone with kept telling us the seats were disappearing as she went to click on them, because everyone is in the same boat as us. We're all stuck here because all flights have been canceled out of Puerto Rico, desperate to book new flights.\n\nAfter an hour on the phone, we had managed to get tickets for Friday, six days from now. But we're unsure if that flight will get canceled, too. It's all very up in the air right now.\n\nWe're really lucky that we've got family to stay with. I know there are so many people who can't find hotels to stay in.\n\nEven though we have accommodation, this delay in getting home is going to have a big impact on us.\n\nWe had meticulously planned the finances for this trip, setting aside and saving exactly the amount we needed to make such a special trip. We aren't a wealthy family, so we had to scrimp to make this trip possible.\n\nHowever, since we can't return home, we'll end up spending several hundred dollars more than we expected on our pet sitter and airport parking, which will definitely be a financial strain on our family.\n\nOur 8-year-old is missing some standardized testing and school, and our 4-year-old daughter is booked in for preschool, which is nonrefundable.\n\nI will need to use my sick leave to cover the time I will be missing work, as I have already used my vacation leave for this trip and didn't bring my work laptop with me. Malcolm is the same.\n\nMy mom borrowed a car from a friend for us to use while we were here, and we've had to ask the friend to use the car a bit longer because you can't get around Puerto Rico without a car.\n\nWe know we aren't the only ones in this position. Today, we took the kids to the beach — trying to make the best of a bad situation — and met several families with kids going through exactly the same.\n\nIt's one thing to be stuck when it's just you, but adding kids to the equation makes it that much more difficult.\n\nWe're also nervous about what Venezuela might do in response to this attack, and if we'll still be here if and when something kicks off in Puerto Rico.\n\nWe just wanted to spend some time with my family for Christmas, something we've never done before, and then this happened. It's just really frustrating.",

    "description": "Pulling back from friendships showed me exactly who wanted me in their lives — and it finally quieted my lifelong fear of rejection.",
    "fullText": "Ever since I was a little girl, I remember that friendships were a priority for me; I would constantly ask my mom to let me have friends over for playdates and sleepovers.\n\nAs a teenager, I had a Nokia brick phone and a driver's license, and I could always be found planning to see friends or inviting them over to mine.\n\nThe craving for friendship has continued ever since, with my incessant desire for it fuelled by an innate need to feel accepted. I moved a number of times when I was a kid, and I fought against the outsider mentality by developing relationships that would help me become part of social circles.\n\nAs an adult, I moved from the US to Wales, and once again, had to find a way to fit in — through friendship.\n\nI invited myself to people's houses for coffee and asked them to go for walks with me. I texted and rang to check in on friends I had made through church, work, my kids' school, and my husband's previous social circles.\n\nThese friends were incredibly important to me, and I had to hold on to them. I felt the only way to do this was to maintain frequent contact, more often than not initiated by me.\n\nIn recent years, I found myself thinking: What would happen if I didn't text, call, or plan to meet up with friends? Would they get in touch with me?\n\nIt's led to little monthlong experiments — going quiet to see who I'd hear from, if anyone.\n\nThe results have been both disappointing and frustrating, yet reaffirming. There were some friends who didn't make any contact (and I felt rejected as a result), others who got in touch with me.\n\nAll of my childhood fears about exclusion and rejection were acutely felt once again.\n\nI had lots to think through. Did I mind being the one who initiated the friendship — the one who kept it going? Was my concept of friendship too intense for other people? Were there some friendships I was willing to put in the work, even if I felt it wasn't always reciprocated? Was I a needy friend?\n\nThis soul-searching led me to understand a few things about myself and the nature of friendship.\n\nI'm a loyal friend who values deep, meaningful relationships that require time and effort. I make space for close friends, even though I work full-time, am married, and have three children, and I crave friendships with people who share the same values. A twice-a-year check-in just doesn't do it for me. I want sisterhood.\n\nHowever, this is not necessarily a value that everyone else has, and that's OK. I suppose some people don't need such intense friendships. Or perhaps they already have them with family or other friends. I can't get frustrated with or feel rejected by friends who don't have the same idea of friendship as I do.\n\nTo avoid frustration and feelings of rejection, over the last year, I've decided to mentally note which friends want the depth of friendship I offer and those who are happy with a surface-level relationship.\n\nI leaned into those deep friendships (three of them) — people who valued relationships as much as I did. They feel like my village, those who depend on me, and those who I can depend on. They're the ones who check in with me, just as I check in on them. It's not me who initiates everything — they're texting and calling too. They're fiercely loyal.\n\nBut I stopped chasing friends who didn't seem to place the same value on friendship as I do. I didn't cut them out (and would happily still see them for a coffee), but I didn't prioritize contact as I had before. I didn't feel any resentment, but rather an understanding that we had different ideas of what friendship entailed. And that's totally OK — I can accept this without feeling rejected or unwanted. When we do see each other, at school gates, on the streets, or for an infrequent meet-up, I enjoy their company, expecting no more than they are able to give.\n\nAnd then, there were a couple of friends whom I knew I would have to initiate contact with if I wanted to maintain our friendship — I'd have to accept that for it to continue. I appreciated their friendships too much to only see or hear from them occasionally.\n\nOver the past year, with these changes in place, I feel completely content in my friendships, as I have never before. I know where I stand with friends, and as a result, don't feel rejected — no longer that child with an insatiable desire to be accepted by everyone. I know I'm wanted and loved, not by everyone, but by a few, and that's enough now.",

    "description": "From outbound vacationers to students returning for the new semester, the US raid on Venezuela disrupted travel across the region.",
    "fullText": "The US raid on Venezuela that netted President Nicólas Maduro and his wife on Saturday has sent surprised travelers into a mild tailspin.\n\nFlightradar24 data shows Venezuela's airspace is empty following the strikes. While US airlines haven't flown there for years, the Federal Aviation Administration on Saturday formally barred operations in Venezuelan airspace, essentially codifying an already de facto no-fly zone.\n\nBut the impact extends beyond Venezuela.\n\nAirlines are also avoiding nearby southern Caribbean airspace due to heightened security risks. Delta, American Airlines, and Southwest Airlines said they canceled flights to the Caribbean on Saturday morning following the US strike on Venezuela.\n\nThe cancellations have inconvenienced many travelers, particularly students returning for the start of the new semester.\n\n\"I don't know what I'm doing right now,\" Catalina Rodriguez, a veterinary student at Ross University School of Medicine in St. Kitts and Nevis, said in a video she posted to TikTok. \"One of my flights is good, my other flight is delayed, am I supposed to change my trip?\"\n\nRodriguez, 34, later told Business Insider in a call that she is supposed to start her third semester of veterinary school on Monday. She is scheduled to fly on American Airlines at noon on Sunday, but her flight is now delayed. She said she's also been in touch with several classmates who are stuck in airports due to cancellations and delays.\n\n\"We're just waiting to see what's going to happen,\" she said. \"It's a little stressful for sure.\"\n\nAnother student, who goes by \"dani la doctorcita\" on TikTok, said in a video that her Delta flight to St. Kitts was canceled. \"All US flights have been canceled,\" she said. \"Delta won't fly even from Puerto Rico.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that aviation risk-intelligence firm Osprey Flight Solutions — a widely used industry service that tracks safety and security hazards for airlines — recently upgraded its risk assessment for the Southern Caribbean Sea from \"moderate\" to \"high\" amid escalating tensions.\n\nThat higher-risk zone includes places like Puerto Rico, Aruba, Curaçao, the British and US Virgin Islands, Antigua & Barbuda, Saint Thomas, Grenada, Barbados, and parts of Trinidad & Tobago and Guyana. Mass disruptions to and from these destinations have left thousands stranded as airlines reassess safety risks and insurance exposure.\n\nStranded travelers have few options to depart Caribbean nations — and little help from airlines while they wait.\n\nBecause the disruptions stem from government action outside the airlines' control, carriers do not legally owe passengers compensation. That means meals, hotels, and ground transportation are not required under federal law, though airlines may offer assistance as a gesture of goodwill.\n\nOne X user who goes by Nate_F_Thurmond posted a photo of a group of stranded travelers in St. John.\n\n\"Passengers stranded in St John just learning that Caribbean Airspace is closed,\" they wrote. \"American, JetBlue, and Delta canceled flights. People are scrambling to find places to stay. Being told 3-5 days by the airlines. All this because of Venezuela??\"\n\nIn most cases, the only guaranteed option is rebooking, and travelers may struggle to find alternative accommodations while waiting for the next available flight.\n\nSome flights are still operating, but they are taking significant detours to avoid the region. American Airlines Flight 1512 from Georgetown, Guyana, to Miami on Saturday, for example, ditched its usual route east of Venezuela through the southern Caribbean and instead flew west around the area, adding roughly an hour of flight time.\n\nFor travelers who want to cancel or postpone their Caribbean holidays, most airlines — including Delta, United, American, Southwest, and JetBlue — are waiving change and cancellation fees as the situation continues. Some western Caribbean countries, such as the Dominican Republic and Jamaica, are not included on waiver lists.\n\nUS Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on Saturday afternoon that the FAA will lift airspace restrictions over the Caribbean and Venezuela \"when appropriate.\" His update came about 15 hours after the FAA issued an emergency notice in the region.\n\n\"Early this morning in support of the Department of War, the FAA restricted the airspace in the Caribbean and Venezuela to ensure the SAFETY of the flying public,\" Duffy wrote on X. \"When appropriate, these airspace restrictions will be lifted. Please work with your airlines directly if your flight has been impacted.\"",

This time there was to be no Connacht comeback.\n\nOff a dominant scrum, another area of Leinster's game that showed marked improvement after the turn, they again executed well with Prendergast delaying his pass perfectly to send Tector over for his second and Leinster's sixth.\n\nJust after the hour mark, that score ended the game as a contest and things quickly got worse for Connacht.\n\nFor Leinster's seventh try, Tector was provider rather than scorer, intercepting a Connacht pass before sprinting into space and finding O'Brien on his shoulder.\n\nWith five minutes remaining, wing JJ Kenny ran in from distance for a deserved try to round out the night's scoring.\n\nThe win marked Leinster's seventh in succession, a run that goes back to defeat by Munster at Croke Park back in October.\n\nDespite the recent domestic struggles of La Rochelle, however, the URC champions will surely expect a greater challenge next weekend when they return to European action in what will be a repeat of the 2022 and 2023 Champions Cup finals against Ronan O'Gara's side.\n\nLeinster: Frawley; O'Brien, Cooney, Tector, Kenny; Prendergast, Gibson-Park; Boyle, Sheehan (capt), Clarkson, McCarthy, Deeny, Mangan, Connors, Conan.\n\nReplacements: McCarthy, Cahir, Porter, O'Tighearnaigh, Deegan, Van der Flier, McGrath, Osborne.\n\nConnacht: Gilbert; Mullins, Hawkshaw, Aki, Treacy; Ioane, Devine; Buckley, Tierney-Martin, Bealham, Joyce, O'Connor, Murphy, Prendergast, Jansen.\n\nReplacements: De Buitlear, Bohan, Barrett, Murray, Boyle, Murphy, West, Forde.",

Umaga's conversion brought the hosts back to within a point with 23 minutes to play.\n\nIt was set up for a tense finish but Edinburgh held firm to record their first URC victory since late November, with Thompson's replacement Cammy Scott missing a late penalty.\n\nEdinburgh move on to three wins from eight in the division this season.\n\nEveritt's side return to Champions Cup action over the next two Fridays, at home to Gloucester then away to Bath.\n\nBenetton: Gallagher, Lynagh, Odogwu, Marin, Mendy, Umaga, Garbisi, Gallo, Bernasconi, Ferrari, N.

We didn't deserve anything from the game,\" he told BBC Match of the Day.\n\n\"There have been other games where I have stood here and said 'we've been competitive and the result has not gone our way'.\n\n\"It was a big shift from losing the game against Newcastle, which was very different from how we looked today.

A rolling line-out maul was sent towards the Zebre line, scrum-half Ben Afshar peeled off and drew the defence before popping inside for McDowall to glide over untouched.\n\nFull-back Smith continued his excellent recent form with a fabulous second try, showing tremendous pace and footwork to slice through the defence and go in under the sticks.\n\nZebre struck against the run of play when Bertaccini crossed, but Glasgow re-established the two-score advantage just before half-time when hooker Stephen finished off a driving maul.\n\nThe Italians were not done yet and powered a rolling maul over the line for substitute hooker Quattrini to dot down.\n\nWarriors dampened the visitors' enthusiasm with a brilliantly engineered fourth try to seal the bonus point.\n\nSome exquisite handling created space for Duncan Munn to deftly chip ahead and nobody was beating Dobie in the race to the corner. Weir, having entered the action a few minutes earlier, banged over the conversion from the touchline.\n\nGlasgow used the maul to great effect once again to send substitute Hiddleston over for try number five.\n\nThe sixth almost raised the Scotstoun roof as Dobie made a searing break up the touchline, stepped inside and found Weir to send the club great over for one final try before he moves into an academy coaching role.\n\nDobie added another to round off a very satisfying evening for Franco Smith's side.\n\nGlasgow Warriors: Smith, Munn, McDowall, Yule, Dobie, Hastings, Afshar, Schickerling, Stephen, Richardson, Oguntibeju, Williamson, Ferrie, Darge, Duncan.\n\nReplacements: Hiddleston, Sutherland, Talakai, Craig, Miller, Oliver, Weir, Lancaster.\n\nZebre: Pani, Belloni, Bertaccini, Lucchin, Batista, Roger, Dominguez, Buonfiglio, Klein, Pieretto, Canali, Carrera, Volpi, Bianchi, Ruggeri.\n\nReplacements: Quattrini, Franceschetto, Nocera, Milano, Odiase, Prinsloo, Montemauri, Morisi.",

They offered nothing.\n\n\"Players pulling out of challenges, not throwing themselves at the ball, it was as bad as I've seen from any team.\"\n\nOn an afternoon when his side were dragged further into the relegation fight, Nuno's verdict was equally damning.\n\nThe Hammers boss apologised to fans, saying: \"It was embarrassing.\n\n\"Today was the worst performance that we have had. I don't recall one day that I felt so bad in a football pitch.\n\n\"It's not about my future. It's about how can we get out of this situation, how can we improve and get the results that make us climb the table. This is what we are concerned about.\"\n\nThe Portuguese tactician took over from Graham Potter with the club 19th in September, but with the Hammers still languishing in the bottom three, is time running out for him and his players to affect the outcome?",

So, maybe I have to adapt.\"\n\nAmorim subsequently shifted to a four at the back formation for the 1-0 win against Newcastle on 26 December, before reverting to five at the back when United were held to a draw by bottom side Wolves four days later.\n\nOn 23 December, the day before Amorim's comment, United officials privately accepted their pursuit of Bournemouth's £65m attacker Antoine Semenyo was destined to end in failure, although they stressed the intention had never been to use the 25-year-old as a wing-back.\n\nSpeaking to journalists before his side's Premier League trip to Leeds on Sunday, Amorim was asked to explain why he did not know the position around recruitment when he joined United from Sporting in November 2024.\n\n\"I don't want to talk about that,\" he said. \"I just focus on the Leeds game.\"",

    "fullText": "Tries: Fischetti 2, Coles 3, Mitchell, Freeman, Todaro 2, F Smith Cons: F Smith 8\n\nTries: Cleaves, Dombrandt 2 Cons: M Smith 3\n\nAlex Coles scored a hat-trick as Northampton Saints produced an irresistible 10-try performance to demolish Harlequins and return to the top of the Prem table.\n\nSaints breached the Quins' defence almost at will in the first half with Danilo Fischetti, Coles, Alex Mitchell and Tommy Freeman all getting their names on the scoresheet.\n\nCassius Cleaves and Alex Dombrandt responded for Quins, but two further scores each from Coles and Edoardo Todaro in the second half, plus one from Fin Smith, secured another breathtaking Saints victory.\n\nThey will be concerned, however, about an injury suffered by captain Fraser Dingwall, who was carried off wearing a neck brace close to half-time.\n\nAfter Bath went to the top of the table with a dramatic win over Exeter earlier in the day, Northampton fell behind within minutes of the start.\n\nBenefitting from quick ball, the visitors drove into the Saints 22, before Marcus Smith eventually found Cleaves on a perfect line to split the home defence before dotting down.\n\nBoth sides then spurned chances, with George Turner inches away from a try on his first league start, before Saints levelled the scores.\n\nA scintillating break down the wing involving George Hendy and James Ramm brought them to the Quins' line, which was then promptly breached by the rampaging Fischetti.\n\nIn sparkling form, full-back Hendy was also instrumental in the Saints' second try, running a beautiful loop to isolate defenders, before offloading to Ramm who eventually fed Coles for another superb attacking score.\n\nA third soon followed for Phil Dowson's men, with Quins unable to deal with the speed of the attack, and quick offloading from Fischetti and Coles freed scrum-half Mitchell, who had no difficulty in reaching the line.\n\nFischetti then inflicted further pain on Quins by scoring his second from Mitchell's offload to secure the bonus point well before the interval.\n\nHarlequins responded with their second from a perfectly executed set-piece move from a line-out in the 22, the ball quickly recycled through Chandler Cunningham-South to Dombrandt, who dived over untouched in the corner.\n\nIt was to prove only a temporary respite as, with seemingly nothing on, Mitchell danced his way around multiple defenders in midfield before feeding Freeman, who evaded Nick David as Saints reached the interval 33-14 in front.\n\nThe game, unsurprisingly, did not continue at quite the same ferocious pace in the second half, but that did not prevent Saints from adding to their lead.\n\nCraig Wright was just one of numerous players battering at the Quins line, before the ball found its way to Coles, who proved unstoppable from point-blank range.\n\nTodaro then got in on the scoring, the Italy winger the beneficiary of further wizardry from Hendy to sprint away and dive over untouched.\n\nNorthampton's eighth try was more fortuitous than well-crafted, with Smith the happy recipient following a pass from Anthony Belleau that rebounded off the head of JJ van der Mescht.\n\nYet another spectacular score followed, however, when Todaro powered his way through four Quins tacklers to secure his brace before Dombrandt added his second as a consolation after a break from Rodrigo Isgro.\n\nSaints were not done, with Coles getting his hat-trick with the final score of the game as they returned to the top, two points clear of Bath.\n\nThe result left Harlequins in eighth, one point above Gloucester in ninth.\n\nNorthampton head coach Sam Vesty told BBC Radio Northampton:\n\n\"We scored some fantastic tries there, got the game going really fast and we're dangerous when we're like that.\n\n\"Slightly disappointed in our defence in the first half. I thought we were much better in the second half in that respect.\n\n\"Alex Coles has been excellent. He's always on the end of a line break and he's the best celebrator in the team - he's always next to the guy scoring a try but it's often him on the end of it.\"\n\nOn Fraser Dingwall: \"Fraser's up and about and smiling so all good in that respect. They [medics) are uber-careful and if it takes five or six minutes (to treat a player), it's the right thing to do.\"\n\nHarlequins head coach Jason Gilmore:\n\n\"If you keep copping those defeats, it's not going to be sustainable. That's pretty obvious.\n\n\"It's not just going to turn around overnight and we've got to be a clear as a club over what we need to do to make sure we're winning big games more consistently.\n\n\"We are where we are at the moment, we understand that. There's no magic formula to it, we've just got to make sure we keep stepping forward and hopefully get some bodies back on the field because the injuries are magnifying things.\n\n\"You're definitely going to lose confidence, there's no hiding from that. We're clear on what we want to go after.\"\n\nNorthampton: Hendy; Todaro, Freeman, Dingwall (capt), Ramm; F Smith, Mitchell; Fischetti, R Smith, Millar Mills, Coles, Van der Mescht, Kemeny, Pearson, Chick.\n\nReplacements: Wright, Scola, Kundiona, Prowse, Graham, McParland, Belleau, Hutchinson.\n\nHarlequins: David; Isgro, Northmore, Evans, Cleaves; M Smith, Friday; Hobson, Turner, H Williams, Pagadizábal, Treadwell, Cunningham-South, Kenningham, Dombrandt (capt).\n\nReplacements: Riley, Kerrod, Delgado, E Williams, Launchbury, Carr, Porter, Bradley.",
