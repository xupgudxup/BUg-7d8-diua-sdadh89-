    "fullText": "The Philadelphia Eagles have requested an interview with Colts offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter for the same position. The Eagles fired offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo on Thursday.\n\nCooter was on Eagles' coach Nick Sirianni's staff in Philadelphia in 2021. Cooter helped quarterback Daniel Jones have the best season of his career with the Colts until he was injured, his season ultimately ended by a torn Achilles tendon. Jonathan Taylor rushed for 1,585 yards this season, though his effectiveness fell off after Jones' injury.\n\nColts defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo has interviewed with the Titans and Giants for their head coaching openings, though the Giants announced they hired former Baltimore Ravens coach John Harbaugh on Saturday.\n\nJoel A. Erickson and Nathan Brown cover the Colts all season.

Cooter was on staff with Nick Sirianni in Philly in 2021 and this year helped guide an Indy offense that was 8th in passing and scoring while Jonathan Taylor ran for 1,585 yards. pic.twitter.com/oEr2bpXANV\n\n— Mike Garafolo (@MikeGarafolo) January 17, 2026\n\nThis article originally appeared on Indianapolis Star: Jim Bob Cooter, Colts offensive coordinator, requested for interview by Eagles",

    "fullText": "A host of recruits were on the Forty Acres for Saturday’s Junior Day, with the staff extending a notable offer to Smithson Valley quarterback Ty Knutson.\n\nAfter a great day in Austin I am beyond blessed and grateful to receive an Offer from @TexasFootball !!

Some of those offers aren’t committable now, decreasing the legitimate competition in a tough cycle for quarterback recruiting after inking top-10 prospect Dia Bell, the potential successor to Arch Manning.\n\nKnutson is a consensus three-star prospect ranked as the No. 720 player overall and the No. 50 quarterback, according to the 247Sports Composite rankings.",

    "description": "Griffin Canning pitched for the New York Mets in 2025.",
    "fullText": "According to a new report from Jon Heyman of the New York Post, the St. Louis Cardinals are interested in rehabbing free agent starting pitcher Griffin Canning, who spent the 2025 campaign with the New York Mets.\n\nThe Mets have shown interest in bringing back Griffin Canning, who should be ready around Opening Day after suffering an Achilles tear last year. The Cardinals and White Sox also are interested.\n\nNow 29 years old, Canning is a six-year veteran of the Los Angeles Angels and Mets. He's gone 32-37 in his career with a 4.65 ERA. He had a career-high seven wins in 2023, and again in 2025 before getting hurt. He was 7-3 with a 3.77 ERA in 16 starts for the Mets. He hasn't traditionally struck out a lot of batters, but he had 70 Ks in 76.1 innings a season ago, signaling that perhaps he's unlocked more swing-and-miss stuff.\n\nThe Cardinals could be interested in a veteran innings-eater to help keep the pressure off young prospects like Quinn Matthews and Liam Doyle. Even though it's unclear exactly when he'd be able to return to a big-league rotation, he should be able to provide good cover for those prospects. The Cardinals may be able to trade him for a prospect at the trade deadline, or perhaps they could ink him to a multi-year deal, allowing him to rehab and work through things in 2026, while flipping him at some point in 2027.\n\nThe Cardinals are rebuilding, but they should be able to provide Canning with opportunities to rebuild his value. If he's looking for a promised rotation spot and an opportunity to impress people ahead of 2027, he could take a one-year deal in St. Louis. He could also end up being dealt to a contender at the deadline, giving him a chance to win a World Series.\n\nMatthew Liberatore, Dustin May and Andre Pallante are assured rotation spots, with Richard Fitts and Hunter Dobbins likely serving as options once they are recovered from their 2025 injuries. Beyond them, Doyle and Matthews are waiting.\n\nThe one that could impact Canning negatively? Perhaps there's too many variables, too many prospects and too many possibilities in the rotation as is. Maybe the rotation spot isn't guaranteed all year, which could scare him to an organization with more security.\n\nRemember to join our CARDINALS on ROUNDTABLE community, which is FREE!

    "fullText": "New Jersey Devils forward Jesper Bratt is set to play his 600th NHL game tonight as the Devils take on the Hurricanes.\n\nBratt made his NHL debut against the Hurricanes in October 2017. Ahead of his milestone game, Bratt shared his thoughts with NJD.tv.\n\n“It’s really special. Time goes fast,” Bratt said. “Super honored and happy to be doing it here in the same place and in front of the same fans I did my first game. It’s going to be a special time.”\n\nIn 599 NHL games, Bratt has scored 161 goals and 322 assists. Over his nine seasons with the Devils, Bratt has become a key contributor.\n\nReflecting on Bratt’s journey since being drafted in the sixth round (162nd pick), head coach Sheldon Keefe offered his perspective on the forward’s career.\n\n\"When I've been asked about him and reflect on him and what I observe is a guy that works extremely hard, is extremely focused and disciplined,\" Keefe said. \"How he prepares, how he seeks to improve, how he accepts coaching and information. In that sense, he's an easy guy to coach because he's all about getting better and all about helping the team.\"\n\nThis season, Bratt has appeared in 47 games, earning 36 points (11 G, 25 A). Keefe continued to highlight the left winger’s accomplishments.\n\n“From where he was drafted to how quickly he got into the league to how he found ways to be successful despite being an undersized guy to being a premier player in the league,\" Keefe said. \"Quite a story, great accomplishment for him. I feel like he's just getting started.\"\n\nThe puck will drop at 7 PM tonight.\n\nake sure you bookmark THN's New Jersey Devils site for THN's latest news, exclusive interviews, breakdowns, and so much more.\n\nFor action-packed issues, access to the entire magazine archive and a free issue, com/free. Get the latest news and trending stories by subscribing to our newsletter here. And share your thoughts by commenting below the article on THN.com or creating your own post in our community forum.",

    "fullText": "NFL playoffs overtime rules, explained: How tie games are decided compared to regular season, preseason originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nCan an NFL playoff game end in a tie?\n\nNFL overtime rules for playoff games\n\nNFL overtime rules for regular season\n\nNFL overtime rules for preseason\n\nHistory of NFL playoff overtime rules\n\nPlayoff football tends to be neck-and-neck. Sometimes, it even requires some extra time.\n\nWhile no games in last year's NFL playoffs required overtime, it wasn't too long ago that the Super Bowl went an extra frame, when the Kansas City Chiefs took down the San Francisco 49ers to go back-to-back in February 2024 on a game-winning touchdown pass in overtime.\n\nGiven the nature of the postseason, NFL overtime rules are a bit different in the playoffs vs. the regular season. Most notably, the playoff rules prioritize giving both teams a chance to win, something that changed in recent years.\n\nHere's everything to know about how the 2026 NFL playoff overtime rules work, and how they compare to the regular season and preseason.\n\nMORE: Everything to know about the NFL's virtual measurement system\n\nNo, an NFL playoff game cannot end in a tie. In the preseason and regular season, games can end in ties. However, with the league needing a team to move on to the next round of the playoffs, there is no possibility of a tie in the postseason.\n\nTeams will play more overtime periods until a tie is broken in the playoffs.\n\nMORE: How does NFL MVP voting work?\n\nThe NFL's newest overtime rules for playoff games were implemented in the 2023 postseason. The biggest change was largely in response to the 2022 AFC Championship Game between the Chiefs and Bills, guaranteeing that both teams would get a possession in overtime.\n\nHere's how OT works for playoff games via the NFL rulebook:\n\nIf the score is still tied at the end of an overtime period — or if the second team’s initial possession has not ended — the teams will play another overtime period. There can be no ties in the playoffs. Play will continue regardless of how many overtime periods are needed for a winner to be determined.\n\nThere will be a two-minute intermission between each overtime period. There will not be a halftime intermission after the second period.\n\nThe captain who lost the first overtime coin toss will either choose to possess the ball or select which goal his team will defend, unless the team that won the coin toss deferred that choice.\n\nEach team will have an opportunity to possess the ball in overtime.\n\nEach team gets three timeouts during a half.\n\nThe same timing rules that apply at the end of the second and fourth regulation periods also apply at the end of a second or fourth overtime period.\n\nIf there is still no winner at the end of a fourth overtime period, there will be another coin toss, and play will continue until a winner is declared.\n\nRegardless of whether the team who receives the opening overtime kickoff scores a touchdown, the other team is guaranteed a possession.  However, the game is over if a safety or defensive touchdown is scored.\n\nIf the game is tied after both teams possess the ball once, then the next score wins.\n\nMORE: Explaining how the NCAA OT format works and differences from NFL\n\nIn comparison to the postseason, overtime in the NFL regular season is a bit different, mostly because games can end in ties.\n\nHere are the official regular season overtime rules, via the NFL rulebook:\n\nAt the end of regulation, the referee will toss a coin to determine which team will possess the ball first in overtime. The visiting team captain will call the toss.\n\nNo more than one 10-minute period will follow a three-minute intermission. Each team must possess, or have the opportunity to possess, the ball, rather than one team being able to win the game by scoring on its first overtime possession. The exception is if the team kicking off to start the overtime period scores a safety on the receiving team’s initial possession, then the team that kicked off is the winner.\n\nSudden death play — where the game ends on any score (safety, field goal or touchdown) — continues until a winner is determined after each team has had an opportunity to possess the ball.\n\nThe point after try is not attempted if the game ends on a touchdown.\n\nIf the score is still tied at the end of the overtime period, the result of the game will be recorded as a tie.\n\nThere are no instant replay coach’s challenges; all reviews will be initiated by the replay official.\n\nMORE:Breaking down the NFL's newest kickoff rules\n\nThe most straightforward NFL overtime rules come in the preseason: there is no overtime. With. games not counting for much in the preseason, the league doesn't bother to try and break ties.\n\nThat change was made in 2021, prioritizing player health and safety in games that do not have any bearing on the standings. Players can be evaluated from the first through fourth quarters, and no extra periods are necessary.\n\nMORE: Why does the NFL allow ties in the regular season?\n\nA lot has changed since the first NFL game to go to overtime on Aug. 28, 1955, between the Rams and Giants. That game was played under “sudden death” rules, and the Rams won. From there, the overtime format was fully introduced.\n\nThe NFL moved forward with that model before implementing sudden-death overtime for regular-season games 16 years later. In the original format, the first team to score any points at all won the game. That included kicking a game-winning field goal. “Sudden death” remained the format for 35 years.\n\nIn 2010, the playoff overtime rules were tweaked. For teams that received the ball first, a field goal no longer counted as a game-ender in “sudden death.” Under the change, only a touchdown on the first possession of overtime could win the game in the playoffs. Otherwise, the other team would get a possession.\n\nThat format was added to the preseason and regular season in 2012.\n\nThe length of overtime was altered in 2017, decreasing from a full 15 minutes to just 10 minutes.\n\nIn 2021, overtime was removed from preseason games, with the NFL citing player safety to avoid unnecessary periods.\n\nMost recently, the NFL changed the playoff overtime rules in 2022, assuring both teams would get at least one possession in overtime of a postseason game. Regardless of whether the first team scored a touchdown, the other team was given a shot to tie the game or come back to win it. If the score remained tied after each team had a possession, then “sudden death” began.\n\nMORE: What is considered a catch in the NFL?\n\nHere are the six longest NFL games ever, all of which went deep into overtime. Because regular season games can end in ties, the longest overtime games all consist of playoff games.\n\nAll six of the games below required two overtime periods to decide a winner.\n\nAFC Divisional Round (Dolphins vs. Chiefs)\n\nAFL Championship (Texans vs. Oilers)\n\nAFC Divisional Round (Browns vs. Jets)\n\nAFC Divisional Round (Ravens vs. Broncos)\n\nAFC Divisional Round (Raiders vs. Colts)\n\nNFC Divisional Round (Panthers vs. Rams)\n\nMORE:What is Scorigami in the NFL?",

    "description": "Philadelphia Phillies hitting coach believes Bryce Harper could be better in a key area.",
    "fullText": "The big narrative surrounding Bryce Harper this offseason is whether or not the eight-time All-Star and two-time MVP is still an “elite” player. A debate that Philadelphia Phillies president Dave Dombrowski sparked with a comment during a media availability earlier this winter.\n\nWhether Harper is an elite player is subjective, but there is one area he could improve upon heading into the 2026 season, which Kevin Long recently detailed during an appearance on MLB Network Radio.\n\nThe Phillies' hitting coach detailed how Harper must improve his strike-zone awareness and plate discipline.\n\n“Bryce needs to make sure his strike zone is better than it was last year. I mean, going there this year,\" Long said. \"He sees the least amount of strikes in all of baseball. If that's the case, then we gotta be a little more disciplined in our own. So there's always something.\"\n\nIt’s important to note that Long by no means was calling out Harper or singling the slugger out. The coach was talking about how everyone on the roster has areas for improvement.\n\nThat said, Harper having better plate discipline is a fair criticism and area of improvement ot focus on. Harper has always been a free-swinging type player, but his discipline during the 2025 season wasn’t great.\n\nHarper had a chase-rate of 35.6 percent and a whiff-rate of 30.7 percent, both of which were among his career-highs in those categories. Still, the slugger managed to slash .261/.357/.487 with an OPS of .844, including 27 home runs and 32 doubles.\n\nEven with the high whiff and chase rate, Harper was still a productive hitter. Now, just imagine what he could get back to if Harper can make some of the adjustments Long is proposing.\n\nWhen talking about Harper and the rest of the Phillies roster, Long continued, “there are things these guys can do and work on. That sometimes it's my idea, sometimes it's theirs, but we'll attack those areas and try to get better.”\n\nIf Harper can make some of these small adjustments and be a little more selective with what he’s swinging at, he could, in return, be more productive and impactful at the plate.",

    "description": "The Bruins were outclassed physically by the Buckeyes.",
    "fullText": "COLUMBUS, Ohio - UCLA head coach Mick Cronin was disgusted with his team's lack of defense on Saturday.\n\nThe Bruins (12-6, 4-3) fell to the Ohio State Buckeyes (12-5, 4-3) 86-74 and a premier offensive day from the Bruins, led by a 30 point performance Tyler Bilodeau, meant nothing in the face of the way they were outclassed on the defensive end and bullied physically throughout the game.\n\n\"We wasted a great shot-making day from him [Bilodeau] with awful defense,\" Cronin said (via UCLA Athletics).\n\nCronin didn't mince words after the game. At this point, Cronin doesn't even feel that he can put winning basketball with the team that he has. Cronin shouldered the blame for the loss, not because of any specific failure of coaching, but because he was the one that recruited and signed the players that he now feels are inept at defending strong opponents and lack the willingness to put themselves on the line physically.\n\n\"Our defense is an embarrassment today. Last couple games it was great. Today, we couldn't guard them... We had nobody interested in rising to the challenge defensively. Everybody wants somebody else to get the dirty work. We're a team that struggles to have dirty work guys,\" Cronin said.\n\nEffort is something that Cronin takes very seriously. Throughout the season, especially after bad games, Cronin has lambasted his team for an unwillingness to make hard plays, whether that's been on the rebounding front or in guarding the other team.\n\nThe Bruins have shown flashes of defensive effort at times, but never enough to chain together a consistent streak of wins. UCLA was riding a two-game win streak going into Saturday's game, which was a brief reprieve from the struggles they'd had in the previous two games, but their flaws reared their ugly heads again.\n\nThe Bruins were especially outclassed when it came to rebounding, a major point of contention for Cronin. The Buckeyes out-rebounded the Bruins 37-27 and had 12 more defenisve rebounds in particular. It was a hard shooting day for UCLA overall, but they kept up with Ohio State in most other stats beyond rebounding, which became the difference maker as any extra chances UCLA might have had were stripped away again and again by their inability to keep the ball away from the Buckeyes in the glass.\n\nThe biggest failure of the Bruins in Saturday's game was by far their handling of the Buckeyes' star guards senior Bruce Thornton or sophomore John Mobley Jr. Cronin said that UCLA had plenty of time to prep for those two in particular, but no one in blue could keep up, or even tried to.\n\nMobley Jr. led the Buckeyes with 28 points while Thornton turned in a 21 point, eight rebound performance.\n\n\"Two really tough guards and we knew that coming into the game. We've just to be more ready to play and step up to the fight,\" Bilodeau said.",

    "description": "The 49ers will be without tight end George Kittle in the divisional round of the playoffs. Here's the latest Kittle injury update:",
    "fullText": "As the San Francisco 49ers and Seattle Seahawks begin their NFL playoffs clash in the divisional round, one star player is conspicuously absent.\n\nWhat happened to George Kittle? And when could the 49ers' tight end return?\n\nIn last week's wild-card round game against the Philadelphia Eagles, Kittle tore his right Achilles tendon after catching a pass in the second quarter. The 49ers tight end had to be carted back to the locker room and was quickly ruled out of the remainder of the game with an Achilles injury. Head coach Kyle Shanahan confirmed to reporters after the game that Kittle had torn his Achilles.\n\nNFL NEWS, TAKES, FANTASY ADVICE: USA TODAY Sports has you covered with our NFL vodcast\n\nSan Francisco officially placed Kittle on injured reserve on Jan. 13. The 49ers' star tight end was scheduled to undergo surgery to repair the torn tendon on Jan. 14, according to Shanahan.\n\nHere's what to know about Kittle's status moving forward:\n\n49ERS AT SEAHAWKS: Predictions, picks, odds for NFL Divisional Round\n\nKittle's season is officially over after the 49ers placed their lead tight end on injured reserve. He will have to wait until next season for his return.\n\n\"Football sucks sometimes,\" Kittle wrote in an Instagram post. \"But I love it. I love these guys and this team. Heartbroken but have felt so much love and support from everyone reaching out. I’ll be good. Thank you. We aren’t done yet! Also when your team owner is the first person to meet you in the locker room, you know you’re in a special place. Cheers, all my love.\"\n\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, the rehab process following a surgery to repair a ruptured Achilles can last anywhere from four to six months before most patients \"return to their former level of activity.\" However, \"some problems can persist for up to a year\" without more exercises to rebuild strength and stability.\n\nHow long Kittle remains out will depend on the severity of his Achilles rupture and the length of his rehab process. The timeline for his return may become clearer once Kittle is out of surgery and has started his rehab.\n\nGEORGE KITTLE INJURY: Is it the 'last straw' for 49ers? Why one star foresees opposite effect\n\nKittle played in just 11 games this season in another year tainted by injuries. A Grade 3 hamstring tear kept him out of five games early in the season, and an ankle sprain later in the season caused Kittle to miss another game.\n\nHere's Kittle's numbers from a 2025 season that featured fewer games played for the tight end than any season since 2020:\n\nDespite the relative lack of playing time in 2025, Kittle's seven touchdowns were the third-highest total of his career behind 11 (2022) and eight (2024). The 49ers' tight end also earned a fifth straight Pro Bowl nod in 2025 and seventh in the last eight years.\n\nGeorge Kittle (season-ending IR – Achilles)\n\nTonges, who had his first career reception with a touchdown in Week 1 this year, is a fourth-year tight end who has taken on the primary tight end role in Kittle's absences this year. His 46 targets during the regular season were the most of any 49ers pass-catchers outside of Kittle, running back Christian McCaffrey and San Francisco's three leading wide receivers.\n\nFarrell joined the 49ers as a free agent last offseason after four years in Jacksonville and recorded his first career receiving touchdown in Week 2. Willis was on the 49ers' practice squad for most of the season and re-signed to the team's active roster after Kittle's Achilles injury.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: George Kittle injury update: When will 49ers TE return?",

I'm really excited about the tournament beginning.\"\n\nAlcaraz launches his title charge against 79th-ranked home player Adam Walton in the final match of the day on Rod Laver Arena.\n\nItaly's world number seven Jasmine Paolini begins the centre court action against Aliaksandra Sasnovich of Belarus.\n\nGermany's third-ranked Zverev, beaten by Sinner in the final a year ago, gets started against Gabriel Diallo of Canada.\n\nNext up on Rod Laver Arena is Sabalenka, who is aiming to win a third Melbourne crown in four years.\n\nThe Belarusian suffered a surprise defeat in the final to American Madison Keys in a thrilling decider in 2025.\n\nSabalenka, who plays French wildcard Tiantsoa Rakotomanga Rajaonah, triumphed at the Brisbane International last week in an ominous statement of intent.\n\n\"I can't complain about my start of the season. I think I played some great matches there, showed great tennis,\" said the 27-year-old.\n\nVeteran Williams is back in Melbourne for the first time since 2021 after being handed a wildcard and faces a tough task against 68th-ranked Olga Danilovic of Serbia.\n\nNow ranked 576, the former world number one lost in the opening round of both of her warm-up events and has played only sporadically in recent years.\n\n\"This is the greatest place on Earth to play,\" said Williams.\n\n\"I have had amazing memories here. I love challenges, so I'm up for the challenge.\"\n\nOther players in action include men's 10th seed Alexander Bublik and women's 12th seed Elina Svitolina, who both won warm-up tournaments leading into the Australian Open.",

    "fullText": "The San Jose Sharks have been a nice surprise this season. At the time of this writing, they have a 24-20-3 record and have the second wild card spot in the Western Conference.\n\nWith the Sharks being right in the playoff race, it would be understandable if they considered adding to their roster by the deadline. This is especially so if a potential target would benefit them beyond this season.\n\nWhen looking at trade candidates around the NHL, one player who could make sense for the Sharks to take a chance on is Edmonton Oilers forward Andrew Mangiapane.\n\nThere is a real expectation that the Oilers will end up trading Mangiapane this season. The 29-year-old forward has struggled to find his fit in Edmonton, and he is reportedly willing to waive his no-movement clause for the right team.\n\nMangiapane has struggled this season, as evidenced by his five goals and 11 points in 42 games. Yet, when looking at his past success, there is reason to believe that he could bounce back in the right situation. From 2021-22 to 2023-24 with the Calgary Flames, Mangiapane recorded at least 40 points in each campaign. With this, he could be an intriguing player for the Sharks to buy low on.\n\nIf Mangiapane bounced back, he would have the potential to be a nice pickup for the Sharks' top nine and would also give them another option for their power play. He also has a $3.6 million cap hit until next season, so he would be more than a rental.",

    "fullText": "Atletico Madrid will be busy between now and the closing of the winter transfer window, as they seek reinforcements for Diego Simeone’s squad. The departures of Javi Galan, Conor Gallagher and Giacomo Raspadori mean that a new left, central midfielder and forward are needed, and currently, work is being done on each area.\n\nMidfield is the priority for the time being, but addressing defence and attack is equally important. For the latter, targets have already been identified, with the favourite having also been picked out.\n\nAs per Diario AS, Atleti are very keen on signing Lee Kang-in, and talks between the two clubs are already ongoing. Director of Football Mateu Alemany has been in Paris in recent days, and he took in Paris Saint-Germain’s 3-0 victory over Lille on Friday, a match that the South Korea international was not involved in.\n\nLee is currently sidelined with a minor injury, but he will be back in action before the end of the month. Atleti do not see his current absence as a stumbling block, which is they have made their move, and with good relations between themselves and PSG, it is hoped that an agreement can be reached in the coming days.\n\nPSG are counting on Lee, so it is far from certain that PSG will allow a deal to be done. If that is the case, Atleti are prepared to move for another Ligue 1 attack: Matias Fernandez-Pardo. As per Diario AS, Los Colchoneros have rekindled the interest they showed in the summer, with the feeling now being that a deal is much more achievable.\n\nIt will be interesting to see who Atleti end up with, but both players would be exciting additions to Simeone’s squad – certainly more so than Raspadori was in the summer.",

Bailey Barnhard scored all 6 of her points in overtime, while Martinez got open back-door to give the Aztecs a two-possession lead midway through the extra session.\n\nThe Aztecs came out of halftime hitting almost everything from beyond the arc, as Martinez opened the third quarter by nailing back to back triples. UNLV responded with an 8-0 run that put the hosts back in front, but Panganiban kept the offense rolling by starting SDSU’s biggest scoring run of regulation.\n\nFirst she canned a 3-pointer, then Martinez got free for a driving layup as Alyssa Jackson and Panganiban made back-to-back 3’s as part of an 11-0 run and 17-8 push to start the second half. The lead grew as large as 10 points twice in the fourth quarter on a Martinez driving score and a Panganiban jumper.\n\nBut UNLV, who have won the last four regular season Mountain West titles, put together a 10-0 run over a 1:42 stretch to retake the lead with 41 seconds remaining. Mariah Elohim made two of her three 3-pointers for the game during the stretch, with Lady Rebels leading scorer kicking the run off with her 16th of 18 points of the night on a transition layup.\n\nPanganiban nailed a triple with 41 seconds left to put SDSU back in front by 1, but the Aztecs fouled Jasmyn Lott on a fast break with 18 seconds remaining, but the guard split the pair at the free-throw line. SDSU had a chance to win the game in regulation when Kennedy Lee was fouled on a put back attempt after Nala Williams’ driving attempt missed.\n\nThe win extended the Aztecs streak to 10 in a row, and was the first win in a true road game at UNLV since the 2012-13 season. San Diego State is 5-0 on the road this season and are 15-4 on the road since the beginning of last year.\n\nUp next will have a bye during the midweek round of Mountain West games, returning to action against the San José State Spartans on Saturday, Jan. 24. Tip-off is scheduled for 1 p.m. and the game will be streamed on the Mountain West Network.",

    "fullText": "All signs are Sam Darnold will start the Seahawks’ first playoff game.\n\nQuestionable to play because of an oblique injury he felt in practice Thursday, the Pro Bowl quarterback was on the field throwing as usual in full pads for pregame warmups about 45 minutes before the Seahawks hosted the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC divisional playoffs at Lumen Field Saturday night.\n\nDarnold threw a couple initial passes. He then windmilled his arms to loosen up before resuming his normal pregame routine. Darnold increased his throws to 25 yards, not throwing particularly hard and more lofting his passes.\n\nWhen the team went to 11 on 11 drills, Darnold was running the starting offense, as usual. He threw passes to Jason Smith-Njigba and other starters. He wasn’t throwing all that hard, because he didn’t have to yet, still a half hour before kickoff.\n\nDarnold had not been on the field during early pregame warmups about an hour earlier. Drew Lock threw to Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Cooper Kupp, AJ Barner and Seattle’s starting receivers. Rookie Jalen Milroe threw to reserves.\n\nThen the team issued their inactive players 90 minutes before kickoff, per NFL rules. Darnold was active to play. Milroe was inactive and the emergency third quarterback, as usual.\n\nDarnold and Lock being the team’s active quarterbacks was a sign the Seahawks were either waiting closer to kickoff to test Darnold’s oblique injury which had him questionable to play, or that he’d already tested it and they’d made their determination. “It’s just something he’s never experienced before,” Seahawks general manager John Schneider said on the team’s radio pregame show.\n\n“I think it’s just more precautionary stuff going on.\n\n“Luckily our medical staff (experienced) with it. And we move on.”",

    "description": "Sumayah Sugapong and Achol Magot had big games for the Wildcats",
    "fullText": "As the Arizona women’s basketball team prepared to go on the road and face No. 10 TCU, head coach Becky Burke said that the Wildcats weren’t going to Fort Worth with the idea that they were already beaten. That was despite losing leading scorer Micky Perdue just over a week ago.\n\n“What an opportunity for some other people to step up, what an opportunity for us to go get a couple wins…when there’s not one person outside this building that thinks that’s gonna happen,” Burke said on Wednesday.\n\nThe Wildcats showed that mindset from the jump, forcing TCU into 8 turnovers in the first quarter and turning those into 9 points. They didn’t back down, and after 20 minutes they were up 30-28 and had become the first opponent to lead at the half in Schollmaier Arena since Feb. 23, 2024. TCU picked it up over the final 15 minutes of the game to survive with a 78-62 victory.\n\n“We can go…and say we threw some punches because we gave it our all,” Burke said. “We fought, we battled, we followed a game plan to perfection that I think was really, really effective. TCU is a great team, well coached. We respected them at the highest level coming into this game, but we didn’t come in here like we were planning on losing, and I was really proud of our team’s effort for that, in our fight, in the situation that we’re in this year, and with losing our leading scorer…There’s a lot of things that our team could be down and out about, and they are not and they’re fighting and they’re battling, and just probably as proud as I’ve sat at a podium despite a loss.”\n\nSumayah Sugapong led the way, scoring 11 points in the first quarter. She ended the game with 17 points, 4 rebounds, 4 assists, 1 block, and 3 steals. She was also one of two Arizona players called for technical fouls after making big plays. Those led to four TCU points.\n\n“In a game like this, where we’re sort of the underdog, I think that’s where a lot of us thrive, just coming in competing,” Sugapong said. “I was talking about, really no pressure on us coming into this game. So just going out there, playing hard, and sometimes emotions take over a little bit too much.”\n\nGoing into the week, Burke said that this game would be a prime opportunity for Achol Magot. The 6-foot-7 center would be needed against the 6-foot-7 pair of Clara Silva and Kennedy Basham. It worked. Basham fouled out in eight minutes without scoring.\n\nMagot made her biggest impact in the third quarter. She had six points and three rebounds while drawing several fouls on Silva and Basham. She ended the game with 12 points, 7 rebounds, and 1 assist. She hit 4 of her 8 shots and went 4 for 5 from the free throw line. Most importantly, she had just 3 fouls in 16 minutes of play and was even diving to the floor to get to 50-50 balls.\n\n“Achol had an interesting week, but she was ready when her number was called,” Burkes said. “And I’m just going to continue to challenge Achol to practice hard, to play hard, to be ready for opportunities. Because, you know, she looks a little bit different than anybody else on our team. She looks like the opposing post players, and from a size, physicality standpoint, we do need her presence. This is by far her best game. She was able to play 16 minutes. We haven’t gotten that out of her. She was able to get out there and contribute in a way that she hasn’t so far this season, and we’re going to need that in the second half of Big 12 play. So excited for her to gain that confidence today and build off of it.”\n\nIt wasn’t enough, though. TCU started to pull away halfway through the third quarter. The Horned Frogs were up by eight with 3:37 left in the frame and had a seven-point lead after 30 minutes.\n\nThey kept that momentum in the fourth. Arizona didn’t score over the first 3.5 minutes of the final quarter while TCU hit one after another. The lead hit double digits with 8:49 left in the game and was up to 18 by the time Arizona scored.\n\nLani Cornfield was the third Wildcat with double-figure scoring. She ended with 11 points, 4 rebounds, 5 assists, and 1 block. The block was followed by what the official deemed was an unsportsmanlike stare down, and she picked up Arizona’s second technical foul of the day. It was her fifth foul.\n\nBlessing ‘Adde’ Adebanjo also fouled out for Arizona, but she made an impact before doing so. She scored 9 points on 4-of-5 shooting, grabbed 1 rebound, dished out 1 assist, and had 1 steal in 15 minutes on the court.\n\nArizona will return home to face Kansas on Tuesday, Jan. 20 at 6 p.m. MST. The Wildcats will try to grab their second Big 12 win after losing their last home game to UCF just 24 hours after learning Perdue would not play. They now stand at 10-7 and 1-5 in conference play.\n\nTCU improved to 18-1 and 6-1 in Big 12 play. They earned a share of the Big 12 lead after Kansas State upset No. 17 Texas Tech in Lubbock earlier in the day.",

    "fullText": "Augsburg striker Michael Gregoritsch has commented on what it felt like to return to the Bundesliga so much sooner than expected with one of his old clubs. The Austrian international unfortunately didn’t make much of a mark in Thursday night’s 1-1 draw with Union Berlin beyond accidentally colliding with FCU captain Rani Khedira early. It was nevertheless an emotional occasion for the 31-year-old.\n\n“I felt so sorry,” Gregoritsch remarked in the WWK Arena mixed zone. “I really wanted to avoid him, but he ran into me. I thought he was blocking me, but then he suddenly turned away. Rani is one of my closest friends in football. You can see that I apologized immediately. It was also uncomfortable for me because I didn’t mean to do it. I apologized throughout the entire game and promised Rani our next meal is on me.“\n\nWith his new club fighting relegation, Gregoritsch wished to make clear that he knew precisely what was expected of him. Despite the fact that both he and the Fuggerstädter haven’t gotten off to very good start in 2026 (a bad loss against Borussia Mönchengladbach and the points dropped against Union), Gregoritsch emphasized that he felt things would trend upward.\n\n“I really missed the Bundesliga and am so happy to be back here,” Gregoritsch said. “[coming back from Denmark] I’ve had a longer winter break and not much training rime. One can see that the team is a little unsettled, but they are basically good guys with a lot of quality. As one of the old guys, it’s my job to help. We’re getting better and I’m optimistic.”\n\nFCA head coach Manuel Baum appeared to suggest so at his Friday pre-match press conference. Even though the Thursday Bundesliga fixture leaves the team on a tight turnaround, Baum stressed that he wanted to build a consistent squad.\n\n“There may be some changes, but I’m less in favor of rotating because I believe we need a core,” Baum said. “There are a few here with a Freiburg past. With regard to ‘Gregerl,’ I asked him today and he said he feels really good. So it’s possible that he’ll start again.“",

    "fullText": "Ben Johnson gives credit for the Bears' success to veteran backup QB originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThis season is the best for the Chicago Bears in quite some time, as they finished the regular season 11-6, winning the NFC North, and have the chance to reach the NFC championship game if they can defeat the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday night.\n\nMany people have stated the reasons they believe the Bears have had a franchise-altering season, such as the hiring of head coach Ben Johnson and the rise of second-year quarterback Caleb Williams. Both have, without a doubt, had a significant positive impact on the team.\n\nHowever, Johnson gave an unlikely reason for the team's success this season: a player who has been in the league for a long time.\n\nMore: Bears' Colston Loveland is 2nd in NFL history with crazy stats, joining Gronk with this record\n\nVeteran backup quarterback Case Keenum received high praise from his head coach for the role he has played this season for Chicago, despite not taking any snaps with the team.\n\n\"He's been tremendous in terms of Caleb's growth. That was really the thought process of bringing him in, a guy with skins on the wall. He's played in big games himself at a high level. He's won big games. He's lost big games. His experience has really been something that all these young players can really lean into,\" Johnson said to the media on Friday.\n\nJohnson makes a great point as Keenum has seen it all in his 13 seasons in the league and has been a servicable backup for most of his years, so even though it doesn't sound ideal, it shouldn't be as surprising that this young Bears team has leaned on the veteran.\n\nKeenum's leadership will be needed for at least one game against one of his former teams, the Rams, which is set to be the team's most formidable opponent yet.\n\nCaleb Williams fires back at Packers’ super fan Lil Wayne after wild tweet\n\nChicago Bears now know who they will face in divisional round of playoffs\n\nBears, Bills, Rams set an NFL playoff record already with crazy comeback history\n\nCaleb Williams planted an image in Packers fans' heads that will haunt them all offseason\n\nCaleb Williams gets emotional paying tribute to Ben Johnson after Bears' playoff win",

But Queta hit him hard twice with elbows, and by the time he got to the locker room in Boston, he knew for sure he had one and he wasn't going to be playing for awhile.\n\n\"I knew then that I had one and that I should just chill,\" Jackson said. \"When it happened I went back to the locker room and I was throwing up and stuff and my head was hurting. The next day, it just kept getting worse and worse and worse. It was a process. I didn't know it was going to be as severe as it was. I thought it was going to be a one- or two-day thing and then I'd be good. But it took a long time.\"\n\nIt was well into the new year before Jackson was cleared to return to basketball activities and after about a week of conditioning he was cleared to play in Saturday's game against the Pistons near his home town of Pontiac, Mich. Jackson said he experienced just about every symptom one could expect while dealing with a concussion.\n\n\"Headaches,\" Jackson said. \"Fogginess. My thoughts were foggy. ... My symptoms were severe. Light sensitivity. Sound sensitivity. I couldn't even be around. I was bad. I was literally just in my room the blinds were shut. I had sunglasses on. It was bad.\"\n\nJackson said he's had about a week and a half to work on conditioning. He said he's good to play but not 100%.\n\n\"I'm in a good spot,\" Jackson said. \"I'm not where I was, but I'm getting there.\"\n\nDustin Dopirak covers the Pacers all season.

The loss of Kittle stings, so we’ll see how Kyle Shanahan plans to replace an All-Pro tight end.\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nThe obvious answer is Christian McCaffrey. He’s been the answer as a receiver. Last week, McCaffrey ran multiple routes down the field. That felt like a segue to what we will see tonight.\n\nThe success of the defense will be determined by execution. Missed tackles, coverage busts, overrunning plays, and not being where you’re supposed to cost the Niners in Week 18. If they can clean those mistakes up, the 49ers will be playing next week alongside Fred Warner.",

Central East four-star running back Brandon Smith announced on Saturday evening that he’s been released from his signing with Arizona.\n\nHe committed to the Wildcats in June and signed with the Big 12 program last month. The 6-foot burner is now headed elsewhere.\n\n“I’d like to announce that I have been released from my signing,” Smith wrote announcing the news on X. “I’m very thankful for the opportunity that they’ve presented me with, forever will be grateful. My recruitment is 100% open.”\n\nI’d like to announce that I have been released from my signing. I’m very thankful for the opportunity that they’ve presented me with, forever will be grateful. My recruitment is 100% open. God’s plan! @_CEBengalFball @BrandonHuffman @GregBiggins @adamgorney\n\nATH (@brandonsmith026) January 18, 2026\n\nSmith is the No. 390 overall prospect and No. 25 RB in the 2026 cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, a weighted average that utilizes all major recruiting media companies. He’s also the No. 37 recruit in California.\n\nRivals ranks him higher than other recruiting services. He checks in as the No. 212 recruit, No. 14 RB and No. 18 senior in the Golden State.\n\nCal was Smith’s other finalist when he made his summer commitment on June 29. Smith was formerly ranked as an athlete, but his stock skyrocketed during his senior campaign.\n\nAs a senior for Central East, Smith rushed for 2,189 yards and 32 touchdowns, per MaxPreps. He also caught five touchdowns. That came after a breakout junior campaign, in which he tallied over 1,800 yards on the ground and 27 more scores. Across three seasons, Smith tallied over 5,700 total yards and 74 touchdowns.\n\nThe departure of Smith leaves head coach Brent Brennan and Co. with four four-star signees in their 2026 class: Downey (Calif.) four-star quarterback Oscar Rios, Gilbert (Ariz.) Williams Field four-star interior offensive lineman Malachi Joyner, El Paso (Texas) Franklin four-star IOL Justin Morales and Pittsburg (Calif.) four-star wide receiver RJ Mosley.\n\nBefore Smith’s decommitment, the Arizona class ranked No. 42 in the Rivals Industry Team Recruiting Rankings. The class can be seen here.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhere to watch Bills vs. Broncos\n\nAfter their first-round bye and securing the No. 1 seed in the conference, the Denver Broncos will host the No. 6 seed Buffalo Bills and quarterback Josh Allen.\n\nAllen, who willed his team to a wild-card victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars, now sets his sights on returning to the game he has struggled to win in previous years. This time, the key difference is the absence of Patrick Mahomes and the three-time AFC champion Chiefs.\n\nThe Broncos, after going 14-3 in the regular season, are the top contenders in the AFC, in large part due to their defense. They will rely on this unit to limit Allen and company, with Mile High making it even more challenging for them to operate their offense.\n\nThe Sporting News is tracking live scores, updates, and highlights as the Broncos host the Bills in the Divisional Round.

FOR THE LEAD\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/KxgLMR7wvr\n\nMims steps up with two wide receivers out for the Broncos.

The Broncos' defense will need to step up to prevent the Bills from adding to their lead.\n\n6:57 p.m. TOUCHDOWN: Allen delivers a dime to his TE to take their first lead since the 1st quarter. The Bills erase a 13-point deficit, and now the pressure falls right back on the Broncos and Nix.\n\nDALTON KINCAID WHAT A CATCH TO TIE IT\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/y4wUrQgjb5\n\n6:56 p.m.: Allen is able to connect with Khalil Shakir for a 46-yard completion. This is now the longest play the Bills have had during this game.\n\n6:45 p.m.: The Buffalo defense is emptying the tank when it comes to pressures on Nix. The Broncos are unable to capitalize on their second Allen turnover of the half and punt the ball right back to the Bills.\n\nPayton elected to attempt to pin the Bills deep rather than extend their lead.\n\n6:40 p.m.: Allen once again gives the ball to the Broncos as he forces a ball into double coverage. P.J. Locke takes the ball right back for his squad and bails out his young quarterback.\n\nP.J.

Kincaid takes the pass for a 25-yard gain, which also marks the longest completion for the Bills to this point.\n\nAllen then goes right back to Kincaid to set up a third and short, followed by a tush push for a first down.\n\n6:23 p.m. FIELD GOAL: Buffalo's defense bails them out and holds the Broncos to a field goal after yet again working with a short field. Lutz has been busy and drills another short field goal.\n\nDenver now leads by 13, and Allen will need to show some of that playoff magic if the Bills are to come back against this defensive unit.\n\n6:20 p.m.: History is against the Bills, and the fumble on their opening drive of the second half is not going to help.\n\nThe Bills are 2-13 in the playoffs in franchise history when trailing at halftime.\n\nThey’re down 20-10 in Denver at half after the Broncos scored 10 in the final 30 seconds. pic.twitter.com/y21jeFHLwP\n\n— ESPN (@espn) January 17, 2026\n\n6:18 p.m.: Ball security issues continue for the Bills as Allen is sacked and stripped. Three turnovers in five drives for the Bills and two fumbles in three snaps.\n\nThe Broncos are in a prime position to extend the lead they built.\n\n6:06 p.m.: After the Bills scored the game's first touchdown and then got the ball right back, Denver fans may have been nervous. However, Buffalo has two fumbles that the Broncos not only recovered, but scored points off.\n\nThe Broncos could not have had a better end to the first half, scoring 10 points in 22 seconds. Buffalo will start with the ball, and Allen will look to make up for the costly fumble.\n\n6:00 p.m. FIELD GOAL: After a disastrous fumble by Allen with the half winding down, the Broncos took advantage of it and extended their lead.\n\nBroncos ball!\n\nWhat a break before the half 😳\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/317eodiE90\n\nDenver scored 10 points in the final 22 seconds of the first half.\n\n5:58 p.m. TOUCHDOWN: Nix looked sharp in the two-minute drill, throwing several strikes and picking up yards with his legs.\n\nRedemption for Lil'Jordan Humphrey!\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/2fGMhIkwyb\n\nNix then launched a beautiful 29-yard touchdown to Humphrey to take the lead once again against the Bills. Humphrey dropped a touchdown in the first quarter, but made up for it\n\n5:53 p.m.: The Broncos will be without Pat Bryant after leaving the game with three catches on the game's opening drive.\n\nTroy Franklin is also questionable to return with a hamstring injury. The Broncos will now have to heavily rely on Sutton and Mims, who are already banged up.\n\n5:46 p.m.: Broncos are able to cross midfield with under a minute to go in the half. Nix once again rushed for a first down.\n\nBo scrambling!\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/UcPe85ot1F\n\nDenver is driving and looking to score before halftime.\n\n5:36 p.m. FIELD GOAL: The Bills were unable to answer the Broncos' touchdown with one of their own, but they managed to tie the game with a 33-yard field goal made by Matt Prater.\n\n5:34 p.m.: The Bills put together a good drive on a 24-yard pass to Cook, then faced some adversity after a sack made it 2nd and long.\n\nBeautiful route by the veteran Brandin Cooks on third down\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/8ysFSIOAtr\n\nHowever, Allen connected with Bradin Cooks for a 15-yard pass to keep the drive alive.\n\n5:25 p.m. TOUCHDOWN: Denver makes the most of the Cook fumble and scores on some trickery. Frank Crum, the offensive tackle, caught a touchdown pass from Bo Nix.\n\nFRANK CRUM BIG MAN TD\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/8SEiIm527H\n\nThe Broncos take the lead off of some creativity from Sean Payton.\n\n5:17 p.m.: Cook was drilled by Alex Singleton and fumbled the ball. The Broncos recovered it, and now Denver has excellent field position.\n\nBroncos ball! Alex Singleton forces the fumble 😳\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/msSHg9AKXj\n\nThis marks Cook's fourth fumble of the season which is tied for the most among other RBs.\n\nThat fumble was James Cook's fourth of the year, including regular season, most among RBs, and one more than he had in his first three seasons combined, per @ESPNInsights.\n\n— Alaina Getzenberg (@agetzenberg) January 17, 2026\n\n5:15 p.m.: Allen scrambles for a 25-yard run, Buffalo dominating on the ground. They've already picked up 75 yards on only 10 carries.\n\n5:11 p.m.: The Broncos are unable to do anything on their second drive of the game. Courtland Sutton nearly made a diving catch on third down, but it was ruled incomplete.\n\nThe Bills will send Allen and company back onto the field, looking to extend their lead.\n\n5:07 p.m.: At the end of one, both offenses had promising opening drives, but only one was able to capitalize with six. Cook was spectacular on the Bills' first drive, as was Allen.\n\nThe Broncos fumbled on the final play of the opening quarter but recovered. It will be 2 and 10 after the break for Denver\n\n5:04 p.m. TOUCHDOWN: With Cook and Allen dominating Denver with the ground game, Allen only needed to complete four passes.\n\nMecole Hardman playoff TDs are back!\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/CWy8FUMSXh\n\nAllen was able to complete a 4-yard pass to Mecole Hardman to put the Bills on top just before the opening quarter is about to end.\n\n4:55 p.m.: Pat Surtain looked shaken up and is heading towards the blue medical tent. The Broncos certainly cannot afford to lose their all-pro corner.\n\n4:54 p.m.: After having a technical issue with his helmet, Allen was forced to call a timeout. Allen changed his helmet and is now set to go.\n\n4:53 p.m.: James Cook picks up a chunk play on the first play for the Buffalo Bills on offense. Cook picked up 24 yards on his first carry.\n\n24 yards from James Cook on the Bills' first offensive snap!\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/T1PX6LlBOZ\n\n4:50 p.m. FIELD GOAL: After a dropped touchdown by Lil'Jordan Humphrey, the Broncos have to settle for a field goal in the red zone.

The Broncos' offense had picked up four first downs on this drive.\n\n4:43 p.m.: After a completion for a first down on the first throw of the game, Jaleel McLaughlin showed incredible effort to gain five yards. Pat Bryant, who had three catches on the opening drive, was a bit shaken up.\n\nOn the first third down for the Broncos, Nix keeps it for a 5-yard run and first down. The Broncos are driving into Buffalo territory on the opening drive.\n\nBo had the defense fooled on the read option\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/ljd2CTiyI6\n\n4:35 p.m.: Bills' Dorian Williams on special teams was in a huge collision on the opening kickoff and is down, injury timeout in Denver.\n\nThe entire Bills team has come off the sideline to check on Dorian Williams. He is able to get up and come off the field supported by Bills staff.\n\n— Alaina Getzenberg (@agetzenberg) January 17, 2026\n\n4:33 p.m.: The Bills have deferred, which means Bo Nix and the Broncos offense will take the field first.\n\n4:20 p.m.: Josh Allen firing up his guys before they take the field at Denver.

    "fullText": "Editor's note: See live coverage of the Buffalo Bills vs. Denver Broncos AFC divisional playoff game here, and return to USA TODAY \n\nThe NFL playoff bracket began with 14 teams and five weeks to determine this year's champion at Super Bowl 60 in Santa Clara in February. There was always a chance that not every postseason game would be decided in four quarters.\n\nThe divisional round is providing NFL fans with their first look at overtime in the 2025 postseason. The Buffalo Bills forced OT against the Denver Broncos with a late field goal by Matt Prater.\n\nThis marks the sixth overtime playoff game in the last six seasons.\n\nHere's what to know about the overtime rules in the NFL playoffs:\n\nIf the score is tied after regulation, there's another coin toss. Here's what the rules are:\n\nThe overtime period is 15 minutes long.\n\nIt is 10 minutes in the regular season.\n\nEach team gets three timeouts per half (two overtime periods).\n\nEach team will have a possession, but the game does not automatically end if the first team scores a touchdown.\n\nIf the score is still tied after each team gets one possession, the next score wins.\n\nAn exception is made if the team that first possesses the ball commits a safety. The kickoff team wins in this scenario, the same as in the regular season.\n\nExtra points are not attempted if the game ends in a touchdown.\n\nAll replays are initiated by the replay official and not by the coach's challenge.\n\nWild card round: Saturday, Jan. 10 to Monday, Jan. 12, 2026\n\nDivisional round: Saturday, Jan. 17 to Sunday, Jan. 18, 2026\n\nConference championship: Sunday, Jan. 25, 2026\n\nSuper Bowl: Sunday, Feb. 8, 2026\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: NFL overtime rules: What are OT rules in playoffs?",

    "fullText": "Oregon will likely be without point guard Jackson Shelstad for the rest of the season.\n\nCoach Dana Altman said after the Ducks lost 81-71 to Michigan on Jan. 17 — the fourth straight missed game for Shelstad — that tests taken on Friday revealed tendon and ligament damage in his right hand and it may require surgery, the recovery time for which is six to eight weeks.\n\n\"If he has to have surgery, it'll be the season,\" Altman said. \"So, I'm sure that we won't have him the rest of the year. There will be a decision made next week on surgery ... but there's just some tendon and ligament damage, it looks like, that hasn't healed.\"\n\nShelstad injured his hand against Omaha on Dec. 28 and has been sitting out ever since.\n\nThe three-year starter and an all-Big-Ten Conference preseason selection, is second on the team in scoring at 15.6 points per game and leads the Ducks in assists (59) and steals (17).\n\nHe missed the first game of the season as he recovered from surgery after breaking his right hand in a preseason practice. Altman reiterated Saturday that Shelstad's current injury is not related to his injury or surgery from last fall.\n\nOregon was also without starting center Nate Bittle against Michigan. The Ducks' leading scorer was on the bench with a boot on his left foot. Bittle used a scooter to move around without putting pressure on what Altman labeled a \"lower leg\" injury that Bittle suffered Tuesday at Nebraska.\n\nForward Sean Stewart said the team recently held a players-only meeting to address the loss of their top two players and how to move forward.\n\n\"We basically said, everybody's just got to come together, next man up,\" Stewart said. \"Nobody plays less hard against us because Nate and Jackson are out, so we just have to play harder than ever.\"\n\nChris Hansen covers University of Oregon football, men’s basketball, track and field, cross country and softball for The Register-Guard.

    "fullText": "The AFC’s top seeded Denver Broncos (14-3) will host the Buffalo Bills (13-5) in the Divisional Round of the NFL Playoffs. The action around the country is centered around Josh Allen and his quest for a championship, but very little attention has been paid to the rise of these Broncos from castaway to AFC powerhouse. Can they send Allen and the Bills packing and punch their ticket to the AFC Championship Game? We certainly hope so!\n\nKickoff is set for 2:30 p.m. Mile High time on Saturday, January 17, 2026 at Empower Field at Mile High in Denver, Colorado. You can watch the live stream of the game through FuboTV or on CBS. The game will be called by Jim Nantz (play-by-play), Tony Romo (analyst), and Tracy Wolfson (sideline). You can also check local Broncos radio network affiliate stations.\n\nEverything we have on this game\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nAccording to FanDuel, the Broncos opened as slight home underdogs, but are now slightly favored over the Bills at 1.5-points. I still feel like they will need to be the overdogs in this game and come out with a win. While the odds have them slightly favored, no one else nationally are picking them to win really. I hope for a good old fashioned beat down, but that hasn’t been their style all season long. Give me another hard-fought, climb higher type win.\n\nPrediction: Broncos 24, Bills 22.\n\nA look at how the Denver Broncos went from giving up 70 points in Miami in 2023 … to being the AFC’s No. 1 seed this season.\n\nProduced by @AjayAtayee and Ellis Williams. pic.twitter.com/6Cqg31nuMr\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) January 17, 2026\n\nBo making it look easy.\n\nBUFvsDEN– 4:30pm ET on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/SCIvhKbbcU\n\nFeels like a Super Bowl 50 reunion at Broncos-Bills.

    "fullText": "Irrespective of your programming language of choice, calling C functions is often a necessity. For the longest time, the only standard way to call C was the Java Native Interface (JNI). But it was so painful that few dared to do it. I have heard it said that it was deliberately painful so that people would be enticed to use pure Java as much as possible.\n\nSince Java 22, there is a new approach called the Foreign Function & Memory API in java.lang.foreign. Let me go through step by step.\n\nYou need a Linker and a SymbolLookup instance from which you will build a MethodHandle that will capture the native function you want to call.\n\nTo load the SymbolLookup instance for your library (called mylibrary), you may do so as follows:\n\nThe native library file should be on your java.library.path path, or somewhere on the default library paths. (You can pass it to your java executable as -Djava.library.path=something).\n\nAlternatively, you can use SymbolLookup.libraryLookup or other means of loading\n\nthe library, but System.loadLibrary should work well enough.\n\nYou have the lookup, you can grab the address of a function like so:\n\nThis returns an Optional<MemorySegment>. You can grab the MemorySegment like so:\n\nOnce you have your MemorySegment, you can pass it to your linker to get a MethodHandle which is close to a callable function:\n\nThe functiondescr must describe the returned value and the function parameters that your function takes.\n\nIf you pass a pointer and get back a long value, you might proceed as follows:\n\nThat is, the first parameter is the returned value.\n\nFor function returning nothing, you use FunctionDescriptor.ofVoid.\n\nThe MethodHandle can be called almost like a normal Java function:\n\nmyfunc.invokeExact(parameters). It always returns an Object which means that if it should return a long, it will return a Long. So a cast might be necessary.\n\nYou can allocate C data structures from Java that you can pass to your native code by using an Arena. Let us say that you want to create an instance like\n\nYou could do it in this manner:\n\nYou can then pass myseg as a pointer to a data structure in C.\n\nYou often get an array with a try clause like so:\n\nThere are many types of arenas: confined, global, automatic, shared. The confined arenas are accessible from a single thread. A shared or global arena is accessible from several threads. The global and automatic arenas are managed by the Java garbage collector whereas the confined and shared arenas are managed explicitly, with a specific lifetime.\n\nSo, it is fairly complicated but manageable. Is it fast? To find out, I call from Java a C library I wrote with support for binary fuse filters. They are a fast alternative to Bloom filters.\n\nYou don’t need to know what any of this means, however. Keep in mind that I wrote a Java library called jfusebin which calls a C library. Then I also have a pure Java implementation and I can compare the speed.\n\nI should first point out that even if calling the C function did not include any overhead, it might still be slower because the Java compiler is unlikely to inline a native function. However, if you have a pure Java function, and it is relatively small, it can get inlined and you get all sorts of nice optimizations like constant folding and so forth.\n\nThus I can overestimate the cost of the overhead. But that’s ok. I just want a ballpark measure.\n\nIn my benchmark, I check for the presence of a key in a set. I have one million keys in the filter. I can ask whether a key is not present in the filter.\n\nI find that the library calling C can issue 44 million calls per second using the 8-bit binary fuse filter. I reach about 400 million calls per second using the pure Java implementation.\n\nThus I measure an overhead of about 20 ns per C function calls from Java using a macBook (M4 processor).\n\nObviously, in my case, because the Java library is so fast, the 20 ns becomes too much. But it is otherwise a reasonable overhead.\n\nDaniel Lemire, \"A new way to call C from Java: how fast is it?,\" in Daniel Lemire's blog, January 17, 2026, https://lemire.me/blog/2026/01/17/a-new-way-to-call-c-from-java-how-fast-is-it/.\r\n [BibTeX]",

    "description": "Your lead engineer thinks 10 AWS accounts is overkill. Here's why starting clean is weeks of work, while untangling later is 6-12 months of migration pain.",
    "fullText": "\"We don't need 10+ AWS accounts. It's overkill for us—we can do this later after we launch. This will slow down product development and add unnecessary complexity.\"\n\nI've heard this pushback dozens of times. And here's the thing: the instincts behind it aren't wrong.\n\nIt can feel like over-investing in infrastructure too early. It is more accounts than most people new to AWS start with. And if you've used multi-account setups before without good tooling, they absolutely can feel cumbersome and slow.\n\nOn top of that, understanding someone else's infrastructure code is always harder than code you wrote yourself, and you don't even know the final product architecture yet—shipping the product has to be the priority.\n\nThe counterproposal usually sounds reasonable:\n\n\"We just need dev, staging, and production accounts. Anything more is unnecessary complexity.\"\n\nHere's the thing: this is correct. To operate any product on AWS, you need a minimum of one account per SDLC stage—dev, staging, production. That's the baseline.\n\nThe misunderstanding comes when you look at this holistically: what does the organization need to operate securely? There's more than your software at stake.\n\nThe \"three accounts\" view only considers the application. It ignores everything else the organization needs to function—and that's where it breaks down the moment you start asking concrete questions.\n\nIf they're centralized—and they should be for security, compliance, and tamper resistance—they can't live in dev/staging/prod. Hence an audit account.\n\nWhere does your container registry live?\n\nIf you rebuild container images per account, you're triplicating images and not running what you tested. If you promote artifacts—which you should—a shared account is the logical solution. Hence an artifacts account.\n\nIn every account? That's 3× the cost and operational overhead. If centralized, how do they securely talk to services across accounts? Hence an automation account and a transit gateway. Don't think you need self-hosted runners? Make sure you have other ways to manage Kubernetes and RDS databases on private subnets.\n\nNone of these are future-state problems—they show up fast.\n\nWhen you put it all together—answering each of those concrete questions—you end up with:\n\nThat's 9–10 accounts for a minimal level of isolation.\n\nNot because someone decided \"9–10 is the right number.\" Because each account answers a specific question that you'll have to answer anyway. The accounts aren't arbitrary—they're the natural result of thinking through where things actually need to live.\n\nDoes this seem like a lot? Consider what happens without these boundaries:\n\nThe accounts aren't bureaucracy. They're guardrails that let you move faster, not slower.\n\nHere's the thing: you can add accounts later. That's not the myth.\n\nThe myth is believing it's easy or cheap to do later. It's not.\n\nAdding accounts later requires complex migrations, scheduling and coordination across teams, and untangling months or years of decisions built on faulty assumptions—like CIDR allocations that don't support peering or future growth.\n\nSome accounts are genuinely optional. If you're never going to have self-hosted runners, skip the automation account. If you're never using AWS as a DNS registrar, skip the DNS account. No big deal.\n\nBut some decisions are foundational—and brutal to change later:\n\nThe accounts themselves might sit empty for a while. But the architectural decisions you make on day one—CIDR allocation strategy, naming conventions, network topology—those get baked in immediately.\n\nHere's the real message: unless you operate today like you'll have multiple accounts, adding more accounts later won't make a difference.\n\nYou need to instill multi-account practices now in how you architect your applications and base your assumptions. It affects everything: network CIDR allocations, naming conventions, S3 bucket naming, Terraform state storage, DNS architecture, IAM trust relationships.\n\nCreate the boundaries now. Use them as the problems present themselves. If you wait until you need them, you're not just creating accounts—you're untangling everything you built assuming they didn't exist.\n\nThere's another reason account boundaries matter that's easy to underestimate:\n\nVPCs only give you network isolation. Accounts are the only hard IAM boundary AWS gives you.\n\nIf your goal is developer autonomy—letting engineers move fast without stepping on each other—fewer accounts actually makes that harder, not easier.\n\nYou end up either doing fragile IAM gymnastics, or giving everyone administrative access—which is very hard to walk back. Clean account boundaries let devs have broad access in some places and almost none in others—especially around production and security.\n\nAnd here's the uncomfortable truth: nothing is harder to craft than IAM policies.\n\nGetting IAM right in a single-account setup where you need to simulate multi-account boundaries is exponentially more complex than just having the boundaries in the first place.\n\nThis might look like over-engineering. It's not—it's choosing where to pay the cost.\n\nHere's the key: it's only complicated if you don't have the right tooling, conventions, and a framework that ties it together.\n\nWith the right tooling (like Atmos), managing 10 accounts isn't harder than managing 3. The complexity objection assumes you're doing this manually or piecing it together yourself. A proper framework handles the multi-account orchestration for you.\n\nSimple account setups optimize for getting started. Multi-account setups optimize for not having to unlearn assumptions later.\n\nYou're not adding complexity. You're preventing it.\n\nThe complexity of multi-team access, centralized logging, artifact promotion, and network segmentation is coming whether you plan for it or not. The only question is whether you have clean boundaries when it arrives, or whether you're retrofitting them into a single-account monolith.\n\nI genuinely understand the pushback. The instinct to ship fast and avoid premature complexity is exactly right in most contexts.\n\nBut AWS account boundaries aren't premature complexity—they're deferred simplicity. The complexity exists regardless. The only question is whether you've given it clean places to live.\n\nStarting clean is weeks. Untangling later is months.\n\nIf you're navigating this conversation internally and want help making the case—or just want to talk through the tradeoffs with someone who's been there—talk to an engineer. No sales theater. Just engineers who understand both the technical reality and the organizational dynamics at play.",

    "fullText": "Umarell (Italian spelling of the Bolognese Emilian word umarèl, Emilian pronunciation: [umaˈrɛːl]; plural umarî) are men of retirement age who spend their time watching construction sites, especially roadworks – stereotypically with hands clasped behind their back and offering unrequested advice to the workers.[1] Its literal meaning is \"little man\" (also umaréin).[2] The term is employed as lighthearted mockery or self-deprecation.\n\nThe modern term was popularised in 2005 by local writer Danilo Masotti[3][4] through three books and an associated blog.[5][6] The word was included in the Italian Zingarelli dictionary in 2021[7][8][9][10][11] and in 2024 was included by Language Council of Sweden in the annual list of new Swedish words – the Språkrådets nyordslista [sv].[12][13]\n\nIn 2015, the city of Riccione, approximately 130 kilometres (80 miles) southeast of Bologna, allocated an €11,000 budget to pay a wage to umarells to oversee worksites in the city – counting the number of trucks in and out to ensure materials were delivered/removed according to the receipts, and guarding against theft when the site was otherwise unattended.[14] The town of San Lazzaro di Savena, 6 km (3+1⁄2 mi) to the South-East of Bologna, awarded the \"Umarell of the year\" prize to a local resident, Franco Bonini.[15][16]\n\nIn 2016, the local cultural association called Succede solo a Bologna (\"It only happens in Bologna\") released the \"Umarèl card\" as a fundraiser for continued restoration of the San Petronio church.[17][18] Separately, a mobile app called Umarells was released that tracked the location of ongoing roadworks and construction sites.[19][20] The fast food restaurant chain Burger King also \"hired\" several umarells as part of a social media marketing campaign promoting its increased presence in the country.[21]\n\nIn July 2017, the Bologna city council's \"consultative commission for street naming\" approved the naming of a public square to the East of the city centre in the Cirenaica district Piazzetta degli Umarells in recognition of the local fame of the concept and the name – noting with conscious irony that the square was under construction at the time.[22][23][24][25]\n\nIn April 2018, the public square was inaugurated by city councillor Matteo Lepore, the district president Simone Borsari, the \"lord of the umarells\" Franco Bonini, the stand-up comedian Maurizio Pagliari (Dulio Pizzocchi), and the writer Danilo Masotti.[26] A year later the street-sign for the square was stolen.[27]\n\nIn April 2020, the comic magazine Topolino dedicated an episode to the umarell Gerindo Persichetti.[28] In December 2020 in Pescara, the real estate developer Sarra installed windows to allow Umarells to observe three construction sites.[29][30] Since 2019, an annual calendar has been sold in Bologna newsstands. In 2021, a board game La Giornata dell’Umarell (An Umarell's Day) was released.[31]\n\nHaving officially entered the Swedish language in 2024,[13] in October 2025 the municipality of Karlskoga formally inaugurated \"Umarell benches\" (sv: umarell-bänkar) for locals to monitor the construction of a local bathhouse.[32][33]",

    "description": "How Dropstone Horizon Mode decouples reasoning depth from context length to enable 24+ hour autonomous engineering workflows.",
    "fullText": "Today we are releasing a technical overview of Horizon Mode, a new distributed runtime architecture designed to solve the \"Linearity Barrier\" in autonomous software engineering.\n\nCurrent Foundation Models (FMs) excel at short-burst generation but suffer from stochastic degradation as reasoning chains extend. In internal benchmarks, we observed that while standard transformers maintain high fidelity for tasks under 1 hour, their probability of maintaining a valid state drops exponentially as workflows exceed 24 hours.\n\nHorizon Mode addresses this by shifting from a monolithic \"next-token\" prediction model to a Recursive Swarm Topology. By orchestrating thousands of ephemeral, specialized agents, we have successfully demonstrated the ability to maintain coherent engineering logic over extended time horizons with a 99% reduction in compute costs compared to homogeneous swarms.\n\nIn traditional \"Monolithic Contextualization,\" an agent’s intelligence is strictly bound by its sliding context window. As a complex engineering task progresses, intermediate reasoning steps fill the window, forcing the model to either compress (lose detail) or truncate (forget instructions). We refer to this phenomenon as Instruction Drift.\n\nFor mission-critical engineering, drift is unacceptable. A security patch written at Hour 20 must strictly adhere to the safety constraints defined at Hour 0.\n\nHorizon Mode moves beyond the single-agent paradigm. Instead of asking one model to \"think harder\" for longer, we virtualize the cognitive process into a distributed search tree.\n\nWe treat compute as a liquid asset. Horizon Mode utilizes a tiered topology to optimize the \"Intelligence-to-Cost\" ratio:\n\nThis ensures that expensive, deep reasoning is only applied to high-value logic paths, not trial-and-error loops.\n\nTo prevent context saturation, we developed the Dynamic Distillation & Deployment (D3) Engine. Unlike standard RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) which relies on semantic similarity, D3 utilizes a Quad-Partite Cognitive Topology.\n\nAs agency increases, so does the risk of Instrumental Convergence (e.g., an agent disabling a firewall to \"fix\" a connection error).\n\nHorizon Mode implements a \"Shared-Nothing\" architecture with a Flash-Gated Consensus Protocol. Agents cannot communicate via natural language. Instead, they emit Boolean signals.\n\nWhen a solution is proposed, the swarm freezes. A dedicated Adversarial Monitor verifies the code against a Hierarchical Verification Stack (CstackC_{stack}). Only solutions that pass Syntactic (L1L_1), Static (L2L_2), and Functional (L3L_3) analysis are committed to the ledger.\n\nWe evaluated Horizon Mode on the internal \"Deep-Sec\" benchmark, which tests an agent's ability to refactor a legacy codebase while maintaining strict security compliance.\n\nHorizon Mode represents a step toward High-Assurance AI. By decoupling reasoning from the limitations of a single context window, we are paving the way for agents that can act as reliable, long-term partners in complex engineering challenges.\n\nWe are currently releasing the Technical Report detailing the architecture and safety protocols.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has turned to his favorite form of leverage in his effort to annex Greenland: Tariffs.\n\nTrump said on Saturday he would impose on February 1 an additional 10% tariff on Denmark, which controls Greenland, as well as Sweden, Norway, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Finland, unless they agree to a deal to hand over Greenland to the United States.\n\nThe president said he would raise those tariffs to 25% in June if they did not comply. All of those countries have already been paying some form of tariff since Trump's Liberation Day levies went into effect in August 2025.\n\n\"This tariff will be due and payable until such time a deal is reached for the complete and total purchase,\" he said in a Truth Social post.\n\nTrump's threat comes as world leaders and CEOs gather in Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum. The president is expected to address the conference in person on Wednesday.\n\nTrump has had Greenland on his mind since his first term, but has ramped up the rhetoric since the US raid in Venezuela that netted Nicolás Maduro.\n\nThe president says US control of Greenland is a national security issue. The Arctic country sits at a strategic point between Russia and China. The US already has a military base, known as the Pituffik Space Base, on the island. Greenland is also a base of critical natural resources, including lithium, gold, iron ore, and oil.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider last week, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Trump administration was considering a range of options to pursue Greenland, including \"utilizing the US Military.\"\n\nTrump's new tariff threat comes as the Supreme Court reviews whether the president has the authority to impose broad, sweeping tariffs on whatever country he wants — and there's a chance it could rule against the president.",

There will also be a rally and march in downtown Minneapolis at 2 p.m. local time.\n\n\"We will gather with family, neighbors, and community to show Minnesota's moral heart and economic power,\" organizers said in a Facebook post.\n\nOrganizers listed several demands, including that ICE leave Minnesota and that federal funding for ICE be scrapped in the upcoming congressional budget.\n\nThe Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation told Business Insider that ICE's presence is disrupting residents' daily lives.\n\n\"Working people from across sectors — hospitality, healthcare, education, custodial, construction, public works — are being targeted,\" the group said in a statement.\n\nThousands of ICE officers have descended on Minnesota as part of Operation Metro Surge, launched on December 1. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a press release earlier this month that the operation was targeting criminal activity among immigrants in the state.\n\n\"Under President Trump, we will expose and deliver accountability for the rampant fraud and criminality happening in Minnesota. You won't steal from Americans or break our laws and get away with it,\" she said.\n\nThe Trump administration has criticized cities like Minneapolis that have passed so-called \"sanctuary\" laws preventing city resources and police from supporting federal immigration agents. In a statement shared on Friday, the White House said sanctuary cities create \"a climate of hostility that endangers federal officers and incites violence.\" Earlier in the week, the administration said it would cut federal funding to sanctuary cities.\n\nBusiness Insider reached out to ICE, the Department of Homeland Security, and the White House for comment.\n\nMany residents, meanwhile, have criticized the tactics that federal agents are using to locate and detain individuals. Tensions in the state skyrocketed after ICE officer Jonathan Ross fatally shot Renee Good, a 37-year-old American citizen from Minneapolis, on January 7, leading to a wave of protests and outcry.\n\nDays after the shooting, Minnesota's attorney general filed a lawsuit on behalf of Minneapolis, St. Paul, and the state against Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, seeking to end the operation.\n\n\"As a result of this surge, municipalities have been forced to divert local law enforcement resources away from their normal public safety duties, emergency responder resources have been strained, schools have been forced into lockdowns and closures, businesses have been forced to close, and the rights of Minnesotans have been violated time and time again,\" a press release from the Minnesota Attorney General's Office said.\n\nHomeland Security said officers have arrested over 2,500 individuals during Operation Metro Surge so far.\n\nCorrection: January 17, 2026 — Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this story misstated that the AFL-CIO had endorsed the January 23 economic blackout in Minnesota.

    "description": "We moved from Texas to Denver and downsized our home, gaining more time together, walkability, community, and freedom for our kids.",
    "fullText": "In July 2025, my husband, Zach, and I moved our family of four from the suburbs of Ft Worth, Texas, to Denver.\n\nAfter nearly 10 years of marriage, two kids, and three work-related moves, it was finally time to settle in a place of our choosing. This time, we didn't just want a change of scenery; we wanted a change of lifestyle.\n\nBut finding a house in the bustling city neighborhood of our dreams within our budget meant downsizing — drastically.\n\nMoving from our 3,300-square-foot home to a 2,300-square-foot bungalow with 1,200 square feet of actual living space (the rest being unfinished basement) wasn't easy. It meant swapping our large kitchen island for a small dining table. It meant no more master bath soaking tub, my refuge from life's stresses on more occasions than I could count. And it meant my kids giving up their separate rooms to share one.\n\nBut what we've gained in the quality and quantity of time spent together is worth every bit of lost square footage.\n\nOur bigger house in Texas required more upkeep, and we were more than happy to give that up for extra free time on the weekends. Now, we spend our time visiting attractions such as the Denver Zoo and the Denver Museum of Nature and Science. We're fostering our kids' curiosity, exploring new places together. Our everyday life feels more special and meaningful because these shared experiences amplify our family connection.\n\nWe're also getting out in nature more. Aside from weekend hiking and skiing adventures, our days revolve around outdoor living. We walk everywhere we can, including restaurants, parks, and even Trader Joe's, which is beneficial because driving to Trader Joe's means parking at Trader Joe's, and nobody enjoys that. Our moods are lighter, and our stresses are reduced.\n\nThe first time we walked to a restaurant instead of driving, it felt like we were on vacation. Our lives had always been car-dependent, but that's no longer the case. The kids laughed and raced each other down the sidewalk. We marvelled at the mature trees and brightly colored flowers lining 7th Avenue Parkway. There was no timeline or rushing, just the joy of being present. When we made our way home after an alfresco dinner at Postino, I asked my son if he liked walking to dinner. He asked simply, \"Can we do this every day?\"\n\nZach and I frequently sit on our front porch while our boys play with neighborhood kids, a first for us. Having houses so close together makes it easier to meet people and form real connections. We know almost every household on our block, and we regularly visit with our closest neighbors. We even enjoyed our first block party in August, which fell on my eldest's birthday, and according to him, it was his \"Best birthday ever!\"\n\nOur boys run between yards while we chat with new friends. They are experiencing a childhood closer to the one we grew up with. They're building confidence and finding their place, and that's translating to more smiles and fewer tantrums. Zach and I are finding our village, and parenthood feels less solitary.\n\nOn a recent trip back to Texas for Thanksgiving, I texted our next-door neighbor to let her know we'd be out of town. Without even asking, she offered to take in our mail. It may be a small gesture, but that sense of community is priceless to us.\n\nDownsizing has also allowed our kids to play more independently in an outdoor space that feels safe and protected. We have an unobstructed line of sight to the backyard, and no matter where my husband and I are in the house, we can hear them if they need us. The result has been hours of creative play, building campsites and outdoor kitchens, playing soccer and baseball, and having water balloon fights or Nerf battles.\n\nMost evenings, my kids are in the backyard playing games and getting dirty. When the weather is nice, they run around with their friends down the street. I would never have felt comfortable not knowing every move my kids were making before, but here, where everyone is watching out, and I can wave at my kids down the block to signal when it's time to come home, less space means more freedom.\n\nOur downsized life isn't always perfect. Despite all our decluttering efforts, we're still left with more stuff than we can accommodate. We also struggle with the lack of privacy, and at times, our smaller shared space feels more claustrophobic than cozy. However, downsizing for an urban lifestyle has given us the opportunity to live beyond our four walls, and that's worth more than any amount of space could ever be.",

    "description": "The president also ruled out the bank’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, as a possible pick for Fed chair.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump announced Saturday that he will be suing the investment banking company JPMorgan Chase within “the next two weeks” for allegedly “DEBANKING” him after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection.\n\nTrump has claimed that the investment bank closed or restricted his accounts following the riot, effectively cutting him off from longstanding banking relationships. He has framed the action as politically motivated retaliation, arguing banks acted under pressure from the Biden administration. Trump has increasingly folded this into a broader narrative of “debanking” conservatives.\n\nJPMorgan has denied closing accounts for political reasons.\n\nDuring the 2024 campaign, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon had been floated for Treasury secretary by the president, but their relationship has since soured. Trump in August went after Dimon’s bank, as well as Bank of America, accusing them of discriminating against him in recent years.\n\nEarlier in 2025, the Trump Organization sued Capital One, accusing the bank of improperly cutting off access to the business, which was founded by the president’s late father and was helmed by Trump himself before he entered politics, following the Capitol attack.\n\nThe president also took issue with a Wall Street Journal story, which reported that he offered the Federal Reserve chair position to Dimon. “A front page Article in The Fake News Wall Street Journal states, without any verification, that I offered Jamie Dimon, of JPMorgan Chase, the job of Fed Chairman. This statement is totally untrue, there was never such an offer,” Trump wrote in his Truth Social post.\n\n“Why wouldn’t The Wall Street Journal call me to ask whether or not such an offer was made? I would have very quickly told them, ‘NO,’ and that would have been the end of the story,” Trump added in the post. “Why would I give it to Jamie? No such offer was made there, or even thought of, either. The Wall Street Journal ought to do better ‘fact checking,’ or its already strained credibility will continue to DIVE.”\n\nTrump seemed to be pointing to a story from the Journal published Wednesday, which reported that Trump offered Dimon the role earlier last year. Dimon took that as a joke, according to the Journal, citing people briefed on the discussion.\n\nDimon, asked in an interview with Bloomberg published Thursday whether he’d take the role, said: \"Absolutely, positively no chance, no way, no how, for any reason.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly lashed out at Dimon, dismissing his warnings that the Justice Department’s criminal probe into Fed Chair Jerome Powell, for whom the bank CEO said he has “enormous respect,” could threaten central bank independence. Tensions escalated further as JPMorgan publicly opposed Trump’s proposal to cap credit-card interest rates, with bank executives warning the move would shrink credit and hurt consumers.\n\n\"It would be very bad for consumers, very bad for the economy,\" JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum told reporters on the bank’s earnings call last Tuesday.",

    "description": "Hundreds of anti-ICE protesters in Minneapolis chased off a small group of far-right activists who had vowed to march on a neighborhood where many",
    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Hundreds of anti-ICE protesters in Minneapolis chased off a small group of far-right activists who had vowed to march on a neighborhood where many immigrants live on Saturday, stoking tensions in a city on edge after the ​killing of Renee Good by a federal immigration agent 10 days ago.\n\nWaving signs and screaming chants that called for U.S. Immigration and Customs ‌Enforcement and Border Patrol agents to leave Minneapolis, the anti-ICE protesters gathered downtown near City Hall. Scores of them moved forward, forcing about 10 far-right demonstrators against the outside of the municipal ‌government center within minutes. Some in the crowd tossed water balloons that soaked the right-wing demonstrators as temperatures hit -4 degrees Fahrenheit (-20 Celsius) with the wind chill.\n\nPolice maintained their distance as the dueling protests played out. About an hour after the rallies began, the tiny contingent of right-wing activists quickly walked a few blocks away to a hotel, hounded by hundreds of anti-ICE protesters who screamed obscenities and told them to get out of the city. A few scuffles broke out, but Reuters ⁠did not observe any serious violence.\n\nONLINE INFLUENCER REPORTS STABBING ‌ATTEMPT\n\nJake Lang, an online right-wing influencer and one of more than 1,500 people pardoned by President Donald Trump after their criminal convictions related to the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, organized what he called an “anti-fraud” rally. At no point ‍could Lang's voice be heard by the crowd.\n\nLater, Lang posted on X that he was stabbed during a scuffle but that his protective vest blocked the attempt. Reuters could not verify his account.\n\nMinneapolis police said in an email to Reuters they were aware of Lang's social media post, but no official report had been filed with the department. ​Police had received no reports of injuries related to the protests from victims.\n\nCamera feeds showed some people who appeared to be injured, police said, but ‌those individuals left before officers could contact them.\n\nThe anti-ICE protest was organized by the People’s Action Coalition Against Trump.\n\nTrump has repeatedly invoked a scandal around the theft of federal funds intended for social-welfare programs in Minnesota as a rationale for sending thousands of immigration enforcement agents into Minnesota. The president and administration officials have repeatedly singled out the state's community of Somali immigrants.\n\n\"We're here to support our Somali neighbors; they asked for their white allies to show up for them,\" said Laura, 56, who, like all protesters interviewed, asked that their last name not be used for fear of retribution by the federal government. \"I'm here ⁠to exercise my First Amendment right because my neighbors can't, they're too afraid to ​leave their house.\"\n\nLang, who has made anti-Muslim and antisemitic comments, has said he wants to secure ​the U.S. for white Christians. He has been present at small pro-ICE rallies in Minneapolis this week and has targeted Somali immigrants, most of whom are Muslim.\n\nSome 3,000 agents from ICE and Border Patrol have descended on Minneapolis and St. Paul in ‍recent weeks. An ICE agent fatally shot ⁠Good, a U.S. citizen and mother of three, after she drove away after being ordered by ICE agents to exit her vehicle. The officer who shot Good was positioned in front of her car on the left. DHS has said he was hit by the car and ⁠feared for his life, though videos show the agent remaining on his feet and raise questions about how much contact the car made with him.\n\nThe situation has set Minnesota’s Democratic leadership ‌at odds with Trump, whose Justice Department has opened an investigation into Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey.",

Joris Seginds added the extras.\n\nIreland prop Tadhg Furlong came off injured and was replaced by Thomas Clarkson, while soon after Harry Byrne put Leinster's first points on the board with a penalty.\n\nBayonne restored their seven-point advantage when Segonds, the top points scorer in the Top 14, landed a kick from 45 metres after Leo Cullen's side infringed at a line-out.\n\nClarkson then scrambled over the line but the officials adjudged that there had been a double movement as he attempted to ground.\n\nFifteen minutes into the second half Leinster drew level with a converted try from Sheehan.\n\nPrendergast made a break and threw a wide pass to Jimmy O'Brien, who did well to ride a tackle before off-loading inside to the Ireland hooker, who produced a trademark burst of pace to scurry over.\n\nA second penalty of the match for Segonds restored Bayonne's lead and soon after O'Brien went over after getting on the end of Prendergast's grubber kick but replays showed that the full-back had spilled the ball as he went over the line.\n\nSegonds passed up the opportunity to extend the lead as his penalty sailed wide of the posts after Sheehan was penalised for collapsing the maul.\n\nWith six minutes remaining Leinster finally breached their opponents' defences again when Byrne chipped ahead and the ball bounced favourably for Prendergast, who dotted down between the posts.\n\nDeegan dived over in the corner in the final minute to increase the winning margin.\n\nBayonne: C Tiberghien; T Spring, S Maqala, M Tuilagi, Y Orabe; J Segonds, H Jantjies; I Calles, L Martin, J Tagi; E Johnson, L Paulos; A Fischer, A Iturria (capt), N Lomidze.\n\nReplacements: F Bosch, E Tumania, E Setiano, A Garcia Iandolino, B Heguy, M Ariceta, G Martocq, V Hannoun.\n\nLeinster: J O'Brien; T O'Brien; G Ringrose, R Henshaw; J Kenny; H Byrne, J Gibson-Park; J Boyle, R Kelleher, T Furlong; RG Snyman, J Ryan; M Deegan, J van der Flier, C Doris (capt).\n\nReplacements: D Sheehan, J Cahir, T Clarkson, J McCarthy, S Penny, L McGrath, S Prendergast, R Ioane.",

    "fullText": "Former Peterborough United and Hull City striker and Final Score pundit Aaron McLean gives his five takeaways from across the Championship, League One and League Two this weekend.\n\nChampionship leaders Coventry came back from 1-0 down to beat Leicester and end their three-game winless run, while fourth-placed Millwall defeated in-form Watford to stay in contention at the top.\n\nMcLean: \"The beginning of the season was incredible for Coventry but they have, by their own admission, hit a bit of a tough patch - so to get their first win in four league games will have done them the world of good.\n\n\"Frank Lampard will be feeling a lot brighter this evening. To come from behind and show the character they showed, and for Ellis Simms and Haji Wright to get back in the goals, I think everything is pointing back in the right direction.\n\n\"The most important thing after Middlesbrough won last night was to make sure they did their job and they did.\n\n\"Tuesday's game with in-form Millwall looks like it could be a great one for the neutral.\n\n\"I think what they have done so far has been absolutely incredible. I hope they can maintain it. They're not a team who will blow teams away but what they will do is grind points out.\n\n\"To go away to Watford, who on their day can beat anyone in this division and had been in fabulous form, and come away with the points and a clean sheet will show what they are about.\n\n\"They will be thinking this could be their season.\"\n\nSouthampton's poor form continued as they fell to a 2-1 home defeat by Hull City to stretch their run without a victory to seven matches.\n\nMcLean: \"The momentum for Southampton has dwindled away.\n\n\"They had that new manager bounce but over the past few weeks they have almost reverted to type and when they concede a goal it's that 'here we go again' syndrome and they can't seem to shake it..\n\n\"They desperately need a good win to get the feeling back.\n\n\"It feels like they will struggle to get anywhere near the play-offs.\n\n\"First of all they need to get some clean sheets. They're not keeping clean sheets and that is not giving them an opportunity to go and take something.\n\n\"If they can just go and grind out a couple of 1-0 wins then that will give them the confidence that they can go and be a bit more expansive.\n\n\"That is what the squad has been built in that mould but now they need to tighten up.\n\n\"At the moment it isn't working and they're getting punished.\"\n\nNew West Brom boss Eric Ramsay saw his side battle back from two goals down only to lose 3-2 at home to second-placed Middlesbrough on Friday. Norwich's 2-1 win at Wrexham on Saturday leaves them four points behind the Baggies before Tuesday's game between the two sides.\n\nMcLean: \"Going back to Friday night's game between West Brom and Middlesbrough, I feel like new boss Eric Ramsay has a huge job on his hands.\n\n\"They lost to an unbelievable strike in their last league game at Leicester and then they did so well to come back to 2-2 to Middlesbrough and then to lose so late on, I feel sorry for them.\n\n\"That has been their Achilles' heel though, they have conceded late goals time and time again.\n\n\"At this stage of the year you find yourselves in that position because your performances aren't good enough. Away from home their results have been abysmal and they find themselves in a lot of trouble.\n\n\"I look at Norwich, who they play on Tuesday in what looks like another great match, they have got that new manager bounce under Philippe Clement, and the Baggies need that now.\n\n\"It looks bleak but there is time to turn it around.\"\n\nLeague One leaders Cardiff City won 2-1 at third-placed Bradford City to strengthen their position at the top, while at the bottom, Doncaster claimed just a second league win since September with a 1-0 success at fellow strugglers AFC Wimbledon.\n\nMcLean: \"I look at Cardiff as the strongest team in that league and they will just be looking to keep Lincoln at arm's length.\n\n\"The Imps are the most in-form team in the division but let a two-goal lead slip to draw 2-2 at Luton today.\n\n\"I think if Cardiff finish above Lincoln then they will have won the league.\n\n\"I also like what Mansfield, who beat bottom side Port Vale 3-0 today, are doing. They've got momentum, they've got confidence and in Nigel Clough they've got a brilliant manager.\n\n\"They're winning games and getting a good level of consistency, if they can keep doing that then will put themselves in the play-off race.\n\n\"Down at the bottom of the league, it was a huge win for Doncaster against another team who have dropped off in AFC Wimbledon.\n\n\"The Dons shot themselves in the foot with a late red card and then conceding in the ninth minute of time added on. That is a hammer blow for Johnnie Jackson.\n\n\"For Doncaster it was a desperately needed win. When you go into a new year you are looking for that spark and that result today could give them that.\n\n\"It is the best way to win. There is no better feeling than a late win away from home. They need to bottle that and take it into the remaining games.\"\n\nIn League Two, Shrewsbury claimed a vital win against 10-man Harrogate to move four points clear of the bottom two.\n\nMcLean: \"Down at the bottom of League Two it was massive result for Shrewsbury.\n\n\"When you are down the wrong end of a division you have got to beat the teams around you.\n\n\"For Harrogate it's now 16 games without a win. Simon Weaver will be feeling the pressure and this will have been a game they'd have been looking at and thinking a result there today could have given them a major boost.\n\n\"The only team below them in the league Newport also took a really tough loss that I think just sums up their season.\n\n\"To concede in the 91st minute and the 99th minute, having taken the lead at Gillingham in the 84th minute... That shows boss Christian Fuchs the size of the job he has got.\n\n\"I think they're going to struggle to stay up but they're still within a shout because the teams above them aren't winning games either.\"\n\nAaron McLean was talking to BBC Sport England's Ian Woodcock.",

    "fullText": "Tries Watkin, Lloyd 2, Moriarty Cons: Walsh 3\n\nTries: Masibaka 2, Ducros, Hounkpatin Cons: Hogg 4 Pen: Coly\n\nOspreys will face an away tie in the Challenge Cup knockout stages in April after falling to defeat against Montpellier in Bridgend.\n\nThe French side built up a 21-7 lead through two tries from flanker Alex Masibaka and wing Jules Ducros before Mark Jones' side came storming back.\n\nHooker Lewis Lloyd grabbed a double, while there were further tries from centre Owen Watkin and replacement Ross Moriarty as the hosts took the lead.\n\nA try from replacement prop Wilfrid Hounkpatin, four conversions from Stuart Hogg and a late penalty from Leo Coly sealed the win for Montpellier.\n\nOspreys, who had a perfect 10 points from 10 in the December fixtures, finished fourth in their pool behind Zebre and Connacht.\n\nThe Welsh region will now face either Benetton or Ulster away in the last 16, depending on the Italian side's result at Lyon on Sunday.\n\nMontpellier completed the group stages as top seeds after securing a maximum 20 points across the four matches and will host Perpignan.\n\nChallenge Cup: Montpellier defeat Ospreys to claim top spot - reaction\n\nOspreys head coach Jones had taken a gamble by making 13 personnel changes from the side that lost 23-19 to Zebre.\n\nOnly lock James Fender and Jack Walsh - who switched from full-back to fly-half and captained the side - survived in the starting side.\n\nThere was no room for Wales captain Dewi Lake, who has been nursing a minor shoulder injury.\n\nWales lock Adam Beard, who left Ospreys for Montpellier last season, was missing with a shoulder injury but Scotland and British Irish Lions full-back Hogg lined up at fly-half for the visitors.\n\nHogg was booed every time he touched the ball but he put this to one side when he converted Masibaka's opening try.\n\nOspreys responded with a well-worked try for Watkin following a neat short pass from fellow centre Phil Cokanasiga.\n\nAfter Montpellier lost Australia number eight Langi Gleeson to a serious looking knee injury, Ducros crossed after he took advantage of a loose tap back from Ospreys wing Ryan Conbeer.\n\nOspreys handed Montpellier another gift when Walsh's wild pass was intercepted by Masibaka for his second score.\n\nThe hosts scored a try just before half-time through hooker Lloyd to trail 21-14 at the interval.\n\nReplacement flanker Moriarty came on for South African debutant Marco de Wit.\n\nThe Wales forward's first involvement was to take the lineout and help the Ospreys pack drive over Lloyd for his second score with a conversion from Walsh levelling the match.\n\nMoriarty's influence continued when he finished off a flowing move for the bonus-point try as Ospreys took the lead for the first time.\n\nThat advantage vanished when replacement prop Hounkpatin dived over with Hogg restoring the lead with his fourth conversion.\n\nMontpellier closed out the game through the power of their forwards as replacement Coly kicked a penalty with the last action.\n\nOspreys: Nagy; Kasende, Watkin, Cokanasiga, Conbeer; Walsh (capt), Morgan-Williams; S Thomas, L Lloyd, Henry, R Davies, Fender, de Witt, G Evans, Morris.\n\nReplacements: Daniel, C Jones, Hire, L Jones, Moriarty, Morse, Hardy, Hopkins.\n\nMontpellier: Taofifenua; Ducros, Darmon, Cadot, Rates; Hogg, Bernadet; Welsch, Uelese (capt), Tolofua, Tauleigne, Uhila, Becognee, Masibaka, Gleeson\n\nReplacements: Akrab, Erdocio, Hounkpatin, DuGuid, Shand, Baraer, Coly, Tangata.\n\nReferee: Federico Vedovelli (Ita)\n\nAssistants: Franco Rosella (Ita), Luca Bisetto (Ita)",

    "fullText": "NBA commissioner Adam Silver says he wants to \"tap into\" Europe's football culture as part of the plans for a proposed European basketball league.\n\nSilver says he has spoken to Manchester City and Manchester United, though BBC Sport understands neither intends to have a team should the venture come to fruition.\n\nWith a current working title of NBA Europe, the plan is to launch a permanent league across the continent that could start as soon as the 2027-28 season.\n\nAs many as 16 teams across the continent could be involved, with a team from both London and Manchester expected to feature.\n\nThe league is expected to be made up of new franchises, current basketball teams and football clubs who do and do not currently have associated basketball teams.\n\n\"We're having conversations with everyone, and it's part of why this process has gone on so long,\" Silver told BBC Sport.\n\n\"I began speaking publicly around the Paris Olympics, and we wanted to make sure we've covered everybody. We've talked to all interested parties, we're covering all areas and all opportunities.\"\n\nSilver also confirmed that he has spoken to Real Madrid, Barcelona and Paris St-Germain as he looks to mix established European teams with new ones.\n\nHowever, reports say the existing EuroLeague - which features Real and Barcelona - has concerns about the new venture, threatening legal action against the NBA should clubs break existing agreements to take part in the new competition.\n\nBut Silver, speaking before the NBA's first regular season match in London since 2019 on Sunday, feels the already existing strong support of football clubs could play a major role in growing the game across Europe.\n\n\"I want to be careful [of] those traditions,\" he said.\n\n\"That culture is so special, so unique, so long held, I don't want to fool myself or anybody else potentially involved in this new league that they can be easily transferred.\n\n\"At the same time, we want the benefits of that incredible wisdom and knowledge obtained over decades of operation.\n\n\"As an American, I see that religious fervour around people's football clubs here, and we could only be so lucky to tap into that. It's more singularly focused here. To me, that represents opportunity.\n\n\"We don't come into the market thinking we're going to take from football. What we see is a large opportunity and entertainment ecosystem, and we're seeing that all over the world that people are turning to premium live sports.\"",

    "fullText": "Tries: Meafou, Marchand, Dupont 2, Gourgues, Delibes, Lebel 2, Ramos, Graou, Brennan Cons: Ramos 11\n\nToulouse avoided a shock Investec Champions Cup exit by scoring 11 tries and inflicting Sale Sharks' record defeat.\n\nA 70-point winning margin at Stade Toulousain comfortably surpassed Sale's previous record loss - a 58-8 defeat by Wasps in 2000.\n\nVictory for Alex Sanderson's side, who had already qualified, would have knocked the six-time winners out.\n\nThat never looked likely as the Top 14 leaders scored three tries inside the opening 30 minutes.\n\nEmmanuel Meafou, Julien Marchand and Antoine Dupont all crossed, with Kalvin Gourgues adding the bonus-point try.\n\nBack-three players Dimitri Delibes, Matthis Lebel and Thomas Ramos all added second-half scores.\n\nDupont crossed for a second try after replacement Paul Graou dived over, with Joshua Brennan and another from Lebel completing the scoring.\n\nDead-eye goalkicker Ramos impressively nailed all 11 conversions.\n\nSale paid the price for resting their frontline stars, including England's George Ford and Tom Curry, although they might not have made much of a difference given the irrepressible nature of Toulouse's attacking display.\n\nJudging the Prem side is difficult as their starting XV will look vastly different for the knockouts, while Toulouse - beaten by Glasgow and Saracens previously - reminded everyone not to rule them out before the stage that really matters.\n\nToulouse will finish second in the pool and receive a home last-16 match If Saracens are beaten by the Warriors on Sunday.\n\nSale, who scored one try through Tom Curtis, have dropped out of a home last-16 spot and will also want a positive Glasgow result in order to receive a higher knockout seeding.\n\nLeicester hopes in the balance after Stormers loss\n\nChampions Cup team news as Prem sides seek last-16 places\n\nFollowing Durban Sharks' win over Clermont Auvergne earlier on Saturday, Toulouse dropped outside the last-16 qualification spots.\n\nAway defeats by Glasgow Warriors and Saracens left the Top 14 leaders in an unfamiliar position.\n\nThe must-win game did not change how Toulouse played, as they cut open an inexperienced Sale side with relative ease.\n\nAfter two tries from close range, Dupont started and finished a free-flowing attack - an aspect of the hosts' game that was missing in the difficult conditions in London last weekend.\n\nA sharp finish from centre Gourgues secured the bonus point before half-time, but given that the 2024 champions lost a 21-point lead against Glasgow, it was clear nothing would be taken for granted.\n\nDelibes' try took advantage of two Sale yellow cards, before Lebel picked off an intercept to grab the sixth try.\n\nOutstanding offloading and slick handling in the final quarter saw Toulouse back to their very best, with Dupont and Lebel's second tries starting from well inside their own half.\n\nSaturday's Champions Cup action as it happened\n\nToulouse: Ramos; Delibes, Gourgues, Chocobares, Lebel; Kinghorn, Dupont (capt); Baille, Marchand, Aldegheri, Flament, Meafou, Banos, Willis, Jelonch.\n\nReplacements: Mauvaka, Neti, Mallez, Brennan, Roumat, Cros, Graou, Thomas.\n\nSale: Davies; Ene, Ma'asi-White, Louw (capt), Wills; Curtis, Warr; Rodd, Jibulu, Harper, Burrow, Andrews, Gilmore, Woodman, Dugdale.\n\nReplacements: Caine, McIntyre, Bell, Hogg, Logan, Hanson, Bedlow, Grace.\n\nAssistant referees: Peter Martin (Ire), Padraic Reidy (Ire)",

    "description": "Was the dismal home loss to struggling West Ham the day Spurs fans finally lost all faith in head coach Thomas Frank, asks chief football writer Phil McNulty?",
    "fullText": "Thomas Frank's future may lie in the hands of those in power at Tottenham Hotspur, but the court of public opinion has delivered its damning final verdict.\n\nThe Dane has been the target for toxicity before as he fails dismally to win over Spurs supporters unconvinced by his pedigree after arriving from Brentford, along with a stodgy style regarded as conservative and dull.\n\nNot like this, though. Not on the levels of fury aimed at Frank at the dramatic conclusion of the 2-1 home defeat by struggling West Ham United.\n\nFrank looked a hapless, beaten figure as he offered polite applause to those who turned on him savagely after Callum Wilson bundled home a stoppage-time winner - the cue for a storm of discontent to be unleashed in his direction.\n\nSpurs fans were chanting \"sacked in the morning\" at their own manager even during the video assistant referee check for offside that eventually cleared Wilson's winner.\n\nSeconds later, when the final whistle confirmed the latest blow inflicted on Frank, it felt like there was no way back. This was the sound of a fanbase who had given up on their head coach, who no longer wanted him at the club.\n\nBrutal - but this was the inescapable conclusion. Frank was stunned, appearing broken as the pressure increasingly grows on his position.\n\nFormer Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney, told BBC Match of the Day: \"I felt for him - I have been in that position. It is a lonely position to be in. The Tottenham fans have spoken and, when that happens, it looks like he will lose his job.\"\n\nEx-England striker Alan Shearer, added: \"The players are not giving enough, there is no doubt but I don't see a plan or a system and some players are looking lost.\n\n\"When you look at some of their signings in the summer, I am thinking you have to give something extra. He knows the rules though, if you don't win games you are going to get sacked. He looked a very tired man by the end.\"",

They did everything they could and this has been going on for weeks and months now.\n\n\"We have 12, 13 players from the squad available and we feel no support.\n\n\"The worst thing is selling our captain one day before playing a Premier League game.\n\n\"We are preparing, it's the first [full] week we are training since September, and then we are selling our captain one day before a game.

    "fullText": "John Higgins stunned world number one Judd Trump as he fought back from 3-0 and 5-3 down to win 6-5 and reach his first Masters final since 2021.\n\nThe Scot will now face Kyren Wilson in Sunday's best-of-19 showpiece match beginning at 13:00 GMT, after he defeated Chinese debutant Wu Yize 6-5 in another thrilling last-four encounter.\n\nHiggins had lost his previous seven matches against Trump and appeared to be toiling as he made a series of errors in the opening three frames.\n\nHowever, Trump, whose highest break until that point was just 60, failed to convert two good opportunities to take the fourth frame which provided Higgins with a route back into the contest.\n\n\"He should maybe have been 4-0 in front and I maybe made it too easy for him,\" Higgins, who won the second of his two Masters titles 20 years ago, told BBC Sport.\n\n\"The fourth frame was massive because if he goes 4-0 it's done, but at 3-1 I felt good.\"\n\n\"People will laugh but I think I'm a better player now than I've ever been. You play these great champions like Judd and I am so proud because I've lost the last few against him.\"\n\nWith the momentum shifting, Higgins, 50, also took the fifth with a superb 104 break.\n\nThe Englishman pinched the sixth and eighth frames with half centuries after his opponent missed reds, but Higgins made a 57 clearance in similar fashion to take frame seven.\n\nTrump, 36, who has generally held sway in meetings between the pair since triumphing in their 2019 world final, looked set to seal victory in the ninth frame but with just four balls to pot, remarkably missed a routine brown.\n\nAnd that gave Higgins the impetus to craft pressure-breaks of 70 and 57 on his way to reeling off three tense frames in a row to complete a remarkable turnaround and become the oldest player to reach the final of a Triple Crown event.",

    "fullText": "Not for the first time this season, the full-time whistle at Anfield was met with boos from sections of the home support.\n\nFor the first time since the 1980-81 top-flight season, Liverpool had failed to win any of their three home league games against newly promoted sides.\n\nArne Slot's side drew 1-1 against Sunderland last month before drawing 0-0 against Leeds on New Year's Day. Saturday's 1-1 draw against Burnley completed the set.\n\nAsked about the boos, Slot said: \"In my head it wasn't booing but in my head it was frustration as well. If you, as Liverpool, are not disappointed by having a draw at home to Burnley then something is completely wrong.\n\n\"I completely understand the frustration. I have the same frustrations and the players definitely have the same frustrations as the fans.\"\n\nIn fairness, Slot's side did more than enough to win here against a Burnley side that scored from their only attempt on target.\n\nThe statistics alone told the story. Liverpool had 76 touches in the opposition box, 32 shots, 11 attempts on target and an xG of 2.95.\n\nOnly three times since records began have Liverpool taken more shots in a Premier League game without winning.\n\n\"I agree that we should have won this game,\" Slot told Match of the Day. \"There wasn't a lot more I could ask in terms of chance creation. We have a lot of ball possession but I would love us to create more.\n\n\"If we play a bit more open you always wonder if the other team can counter-attack you more, which you couldn't. I don't know how many moments we had but we could only score one.\"",
