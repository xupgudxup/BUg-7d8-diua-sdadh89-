Brown caught 73 passes for 1,009 yards and 10 touchdowns in 2025, finishing second in the Greater Western Ohio Conference, and also excelled on special teams with multiple return touchdowns.\n\nBrown was previously at the center of a landmark NIL lawsuit involving the Ohio High School Athletic Association, which ultimately led to NIL approval for high school athletes in Ohio.

    "title": "3 stars for the 49ers from the Divisional round: Brock Purdy went down swinging",
    "description": "Plus, some love for Dee Winters and Eddy Pineiro",
    "fullText": "The San Francisco 49ers’ season ended in a massive crash and burn at the hands of a SCORE rout by the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nRashid Shaheed took the opening kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown, and the next 59 minutes and 47 seconds of game time felt like torture. By the time the 49ers took the field for their third possession, they were already facing a 17-point deficit, and it would only get uglier from there.\n\nFor the final time, let’s look at the three stars from Saturday’s season-ending loss:\n\nFor the second time in three weeks, Pineiro was responsible for 100 percent of the 49ers’ points against Seattle. After his season with the 49ers began after the 49ers’ Week 1 victory in Seattle, Pineiro proved to be the 49ers’ only offense in their next two games against the Seahawks.\n\nPineiro opened the scoring for the 49ers with a 40-yard field goal to start the second quarter. He quickly followed with a 56-yard make on the next drive to cut the Seattle lead to 11. Unfortunately for the 49ers and Pineiro, the 49ers kicker needed 12 more field goals on the night to put San Francisco in the lead.\n\nAfter several years of kicking woes, Pineiro solidified the position for the 49ers, making 31-of-32 kicks on the season.\n\nThere wasn’t much to brag about for the 49ers’ defense on Saturday night, but No. 53 was far and away the unit’s best player.\n\nWinters finished with a team-high nine tackles, but his most significant impact came around and behind the line of scrimmage.\n\nWith Seattle already up seven in the first quarter, they moved the ball into field goal range, looking to double their lead on their first offensive possession. Facing a third-and-2, Seattle attempted a run with Zach Charbonnet to extend the drive, but Winters had other plans. The linebacker exploded through the line, barely giving the Seattle running back time to react after getting the ball, blowing up the play for a loss of two, and forcing the Seahawks to settle for three points.\n\nWinters’ next big play wasn’t a tackle for loss, but a big hit was involved. Coming out of the two-minute warning, Darnold looked for an easy completion to fullback Robbie Ouzts in the flats. While the ball got to Ouzts, Winters read the play well and made a beeline to the fullback, blowing him up, knocking the ball free, and forcing an incomplete pass.\n\nWinters would add his next two tackles for loss on run attempts by Shaheed and Walker, but both came when the game was well out of reach. On such an embarrassing night for the defense, Winters was the only standout on the night.\n\nPurdy’s performance wasn’t perfect, but it was nothing short of heroic.\n\nYes, there was the interception, but that felt more of a Luke Farrell effort issue than it was a Purdy issue, and the fumble lost came when the game was a lost cause.\n\nBut Seattle’s secondary was allowing no space and making everything tough on the quarterback, and he still didn’t have too bad of a game. Purdy was pulled at the start of the fourth quarter with a line of 15-for-27 for 140 yards with no touchdowns and one interception.\n\nIt’s tough to find any stretch where the 49ers’ offense looked exceptionally great. Still, they managed back-to-back field goal scoring drives where Purdy led the offense, completing nine-of-12 passes for 81 yards, with consecutive completions to Jake Tonges going for 15 yards each.\n\nPurdy also got the job done with his legs, leading all 49ers rushers with 37 yards on five attempts. While the 49ers’ longest play of the game was a 19-yard completion to Jauan Jennings, right before the half, Purdy scrambled for a gain of 18, good for the 49ers’ longest run of the game.\n\nOther than that, it was a quiet night for Purdy, but that’s more of a credit to Seattle’s defense kicking the 49ers’ ass for 60 minutes. But despite it all, it was a gritty performance from the 49ers quarterback, and on a night where not much was going right, that’s enough to earn the final first star of the season.\n\nThroughout the season, I will track the three stars of the season, tallying points for each star award using a complex scoring system: three points for being the first star, two for the second, and one for the third. At season’s end, the standings are:\n\nRB Christian McCaffrey – 20 points",

    "description": "Philadelphia Eagles news and links for 1/18/26.",
    "fullText": "Of the rumored offensive coordinator candidates, who do you want the Eagles to definitely NOT hire? Head over to The Feed and weigh in with your answer and explanation!\n\nLet’s get to the Philadelphia Eagles news and links …\n\nRanking the Top 40 NFL Free Agents of 2026 – The Ringer\n3) Jaelan Phillips. The Eagles got away with highway robbery by acquiring Phillips from the Dolphins for a third-round pick at the trade deadline in November. His first two games in Philly came against two of the league’s better offensive tackles, the Packers’ Zach Tom and the Lions’ Penei Sewell, and Phillips still made his presence felt right away, with 12 pressures and a sack in his first two games. He has an ideal frame, great strength, and terrifying explosiveness, making him a dream fit as a stand-up rusher who can line up anywhere in Vic Fangio’s defense. Phillips can blow through and by tackles, and he often manhandles tight ends into the backfield when given the opportunity. He’s tied for fourth in total pressures (41) since joining the Eagles in Week 10. […] 31) Nakobe Dean. Injuries have hindered Dean’s development since before he was drafted. He fell to the third round because of a pectoral strain. He only played 47 snaps as a rookie, and then missed a lot of the 2023 season with a Lisfranc injury. He finally started 15 games for Philadelphia in 2024, but he didn’t play beyond the wild-card round in the playoffs because of a torn patellar tendon that caused him to begin the 2025 season on the sidelines. He eventually returned to the starting lineup over the second half of this season, but he missed the Eagles’ Week 17 matchup against the Bills with a hamstring injury. Health is the biggest, and perhaps only, question with Dean as he heads to free agency. He’s a tenacious run defender with great explosiveness and sideline-to-sideline range. He’s a difference-maker on three downs with his ability to play the run and rush the passer. He leads all linebackers with at least 30 pass-rush snaps in PFF’s pass-rush win rate (28.6 percent). Dean isn’t a complete liability in coverage, either, which is more than you can say about most starting linebackers in the NFL right now. It’s hard to project what Dean will command on the open market given just how much of his career has been impacted by injuries. When healthy, he’s as valuable as players like Jamien Sherwood and Nick Bolton—both of whom signed three-year, $45 million deals last offseason. But will Dean have to sign for less purely because of the injury concerns? Probably.\n\nAn initial look at the Eagles’ 2026 free agents – PhillyVoice\nEDGE Jaelan Phillips: The acquisition of Phillips was the Eagles’ big trade deadline move this season, and for a change it worked out, as Phillips played well, as a pass rusher and against the run. Phillips seemed to be Vic Fangio’s top edge defender, as he consistently out-snapped Nolan Smith and Jalyx Hunt. That could be an indication that the Eagles make re-signing Phillips a priority.\n\nEagles, Brian Daboll will reportedly meet for offensive coordinator interview – BGN\nThe Philadelphia Eagles are expected to interview former New York Giants head coach Brian Daboll for their vacant offensive coordinator position, according to a report from NFL insider Adam Schefter. It was previously reported that Daboll and Mike McDaniel are the two names “at the top of [the Eagles’ offensive coordinator candidate] list.” Daboll, 50, shares connections to both Nick Sirianni and Jalen Hurts after overlapping with them at different stages of his career.\n\nEagles reportedly request to interview Colts OC Jim Bob Cooter for same coaching role – Stampede Blue\nWhile at face, this is a lateral move, and it will be interesting to see if Indianapolis grants permission. It could at least be somewhat of a promotion, as Steichen consistently handles the offensive play-calling for the Colts. If that job would go to Cooter in Philadelphia, then it theoretically would be an elevation in offensive coaching duties. With Cooter’s coaching assistance last season, the Colts ranked 8th in most points per game (27.4 avg. ppg), and that was despite losing starting quarterback (and Pro Bowl alternate) Daniel Jones for the last four starts of the regular season due to a season-ending torn Achilles injury. Until Jones’s fractured fibula and then torn Achilles after midseason, the Colts were a historically elite NFL offense. Even with the unit’s diminished production down the final stretch, star workhorse Jonathan Taylor still rushed for 1,585 total rushing yards and 18 total rushing touchdowns (*leading the league) on 323 total carries.\n\nRoob’s Observations: Has an Eagle ever had a worse playoff game than A.J. Brown? – NBCSP\nI keep hearing people say Tyler Steen wasn’t any good this year and bring back Mekhi Becton if the Chargers release him, blah, blah, blah. Where is this coming from? Guess what. Steen was fine this year and I don’t know why people are so down on him. He had a better year than Becton, and he was certainly better than Landon Dickerson and Cam Jurgens. Out of 66 guards who played at least 500 snaps, Steen’s Pro Football Focus grade of 73.4 ranked 14th, which isn’t bad at all. He was the Eagles’ 2nd-most consistent offensive line starter, behind Jordan Mailata. Maybe the Eagles can do better and I don’t think anybody would be surprised if they drafted a guard-tackle pretty early in April to begin preparing for life after Lane. But you could do a lot worse than Steen did this year.\n\nEagles defensive line coach Clint Hurtt named a head coach at 2026 Senior Bowl – Inquirer\nAs the NFL draft process gets underway over the next few weeks with the All-Star games circuit, one of the Eagles’ position coaches will get a unique opportunity to be a head coach for a week. Defensive line coach Clint Hurtt will lead the National team at the Reese’s Senior Bowl, which begins practice in Mobile, Ala., on Jan. 27. The event brings in the top draft-eligible players to compete in three practices, culminating in the Senior Bowl game on Jan. 31 at 2:30 p.m. at the University of South Alabama’s Hancock Whitney Staduim.\n\nFormer Cowboys pass rusher DeMarcus Lawrence headed to NFC Championship Game with Seahawks – Blogging The Boys\nDeMarcus Lawrence will get to play in an NFC Championship Game. In his first season away from the Cowboys, Lawrence will officially reach the territory that has eluded the Cowboys since well before the team traded up to draft him in the second-round of the 2014 NFL Draft. This marks the second year in a row where a former Cowboys player made it to the title game in their first season away from the team, by the way. Last year it was Tyler Biadasz, Dorance Armstrong, Noah Igbinoghene, and Dante Fowler (who later returned obviously) who were a part of the Washington team that reached the step before the Super Bowl. Where DeMarcus is a bit different than them is he had some choice words to say about the Cowboys as he left that were related to this whole thing. You will recall that upon arriving in Seattle that Lawrence did an interview where he called Dallas his home, but he said that he would never win a Super Bowl there. Micah Parsons, then a member of the Cowboys, got defensive and the two had a back and forth on X/Twitter, but ultimately history is written by the winners and right now DeMarcus is the one holding the pen.\n\nEverything there is to know (currently) about the Commanders new stadium at the RFK stadium campus is available in one place – Hogs Haven\nA 35-page document that has been submitted to the National Capital Planning Commission for review. The full document is available for review by clicking HERE. The document does not answer every question about the stadium — it primarily addresses how the stadium fits into the surrounding area and complies with legal requirements. You won’t find seating area design, discussion of the food service or what type of field surface is planned.\n\nNY Giants news: Cleveland Browns might wreck plan to hire Todd Monken as OC – Big Blue View\nNew York Giants coach John Harbaugh (it is still nice to write that) is expected to want to bring Todd Monken, his offensive coordinator the last three seasons with the Baltimore Ravens, to the Giants to work with quarterback Jaxson Dart. The Cleveland Browns, though, appear to be an obstacle. Monken will interview in-person on Tuesday for the Browns vacant head-coaching job, according to ESPN NFL insider Jeremy Fowler. Monken has already has a virtual interview with the Browns, who fired Kevin Stefanski at the end of the season.\n\nNFL coaching hire grades for every team involved in 2026 cycle – SB Nation\nNew York Giants: John Harbaugh. When the initial job vacancies were listed, the Giants’ job was one of our favorites on the open market. Only when the Ravens parted ways with Harbaugh was New York pushed down the list. And when the Ravens parted ways with Harbaugh, it made him one of the more attractive candidates on the open market. To us, this looks like a perfect pairing. More than anything else, the Giants need stability at the head coaching position. Since Tom Coughlin’s last season, the 2015 campaign, New York has cycled through four different head coaching options. Harbaugh will be the fifth. Giants fans are not hoping to see a sixth anytime soon. Grade: A.\n\nKevin Stefanski hired by Atlanta Falcons as new head coach – The Falcoholic\nAfter a search that saw the Falcons interview or request interviews with close to a dozen candidates, the team has hired Kevin Stefanski, making the former Browns head man and Vikings offensive coordinator the 14th full-time head coach in franchise history. Matt Ryan’s first and arguably most consequential hire as president of football for the Falcons sees him land on the most experienced non-Mike McCarthy candidate on the market with a strong offensive background, a bet on a coach who piloted the Browns to the playoffs in 2023 with one of the least inspiring quarterback rooms in recent memory.\n\nBGN Facebook Page: \nBGN Twitter: Follow @BleedingGreen\n\nBGN BlueSky: Follow @bleedgreennation.bsky.social\n\nBGN Instagram: Follow @BleedingGreenInsta\n\nBGN Manager: Follow Brandon Lee Gowton on Twitter | BlueSky | Threads\n\nBGN Radio Twitter: Follow @BGN_Radio",

    "fullText": "Donyell Malen's impact in Serie A could not have been more immediate. Just two days after his move from Aston Villa to the Italian capital became official, the Dutch striker took to the pitch at the Stadio Olimpico di Torino to face Torino and wasted no time in showing why the \"giallorossi\" management bet on him in this winter transfer window. In a display of instinct and speed, Malen needed only 25 minutes to score his first goal wearing the wolf's shirt, unleashing euphoria among the traveling fans.\n\nThe goal came after a high-precision team move that highlighted the immediate chemistry among the key pieces of Roma's attack. Following a blistering counterattack led by Paulo Dybala, the Argentine star threaded a pinpoint pass into the heart of the six-yard box. Malen, showcasing his excellent reading of the game, got ahead of the Torino defense and struck a crisp right-footed shot that beat the opposing goalkeeper through the center of the goal, making it a provisional 0-1 on the scoreboard.\n\nAlthough VAR added a dose of suspense by reviewing a possible offside in a previous play, the final validation of the goal confirmed that the Dutchman's debut was destined for success. Wearing the number 14 on his back, the former Borussia Dortmund player was very active throughout the first half, not only seeking the goal but also constantly offering support and making runs that unsettled the home defense. His ability to adapt to Roma's playing system seems to have exceeded all initial expectations.\n\nThis goal-scoring debut is a breath of fresh air for Malen's career, as he was looking for a change of scenery after a year of ups and downs in the Premier League. His arrival in Italy on loan with an option to buy — which could reach 25 million euros — seems to be the ideal setting to relaunch his progression. Roma, fighting for Champions League spots, have found in him that versatile finisher who can play both as a reference point and drifting wide, bringing the offensive aggression needed for the second half of the season.\n\nAt the end of the match, the feelings could not have been more positive for the club's environment and for the player himself. Scoring in the first game eliminates any initial pressure and builds the confidence of a player who is expected to be fundamental in the team's plans. If this debut is any indication of what's to come, Roma fans can look forward to a Malen-Dybala partnership that promises to bring plenty of joy to Calcio.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "fullText": "Former Giants head coach Brian Daboll is becoming a popular name on the coaching market and could end up back in the NFC East.\n\nDaboll is expected to interview for the Philadelphia Eagles' offensive coordinator job, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter.\n\nIt'll be one of the many interviews Daboll has had this offseason, including a shot at the Tennessee Titans' head coaching vacancy and Los Angeles Chargers' OC job. Schefter noted that Daboll is expected to have other interviews this hiring cycle as well, likely for OC positions.\n\nIn Philadelphia, head coach Nick Sirianni demoted OC Kevin Patullo after the team's wild-card round loss to the San Francisco 49ers last week. The team is now looking for its fifth OC in six years. It's possible Patullo remains with the Eagles in a different role, as he served as the passing game coordinator prior to his promotion to OC for the 2025 season.\n\nThe Eagles' interest in Daboll goes beyond his familiarity with the former division rival. He worked with Sirianni in Kansas City in 2012 when he was the Chiefs' offensive coordinator under Romeo Crennel and Sirianni was the WR coach.\n\nDaboll was also the OC and quarterbacks coach at Alabama in 2017 when they won the National Championship with Eagles QB Jalen Hurts as the starter and Miami Dolphins' Tua Tagovailoa as the backup. Philadelphia WR DeVonta Smith was also a freshman at Alabama that year and caught the game-winning pass in the title game from Tagovailoa after Hurts was benched.\n\nAnd of course, Daboll coached RB Saquon Barkley during their time in New York together. Overall, Daboll went 20-40-1 as head coach of the Giants. He was named the 2022 NFL Coach of the Year after leading Big Blue to a 9-7 record and its only playoff win since 2011.",

    "fullText": "The Buffalo Bills’ season ended on Saturday after a 33-30 loss to the Denver Broncos in the Divisional Round. Meanwhile, the New England Patriots will play their Divisional Round game on Sunday.\n\nThe Bills have one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL, but have not been able to get over the hump with Josh Allen. One of their biggest flaws as a team is that they lack a true No. 1 receiver. That is one of the reasons they failed to win the division over the Patriots.\n\nTheir leading receiver this season was Khalil Shakir, who had 719 yards on 72 receptions. The Bills have failed to replace Stefon Diggs after losing him. However, they can land a star this offseason. ESPN’s Ben Solak predicted they would trade for A.J. Brown.\n\n“A year after general manager Brandon Beane’s emphatic statement that they didn’t need a WR1 went over disastrously, Buffalo will tilt and get aggressive,” Solak wrote on Saturday. “The Bills will trade a first-round pick and then some for Philadelphia’s A.J. Brown, believing he can be the final player to push their offense over the edge.”\n\nBrown’s issues with the Philadelphia Eagles have been well documented. Multiple times this season, he expressed frustration with his role. In the Eagles’ final game, he was seen arguing with Nick Sirianni on the sideline.\n\nBrown made multiple trade requests last season, according to Joseph Santoliquito of SB Nation. General manager Howie Roseman downplayed trade rumors after the Eagles’ season ended, but many teams could call about Brown.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/episode/2Mf6wJm47JSXK22DVoVot4\n\nHis outbursts and frustration have been going on for a few seasons at this point. He is still an elite receiver and could put up monster numbers with Allen in Buffalo. The Bills getting Brown could be a problem for the Patriots.\n\nBrown is a three-time Pro Bowler and three-time Second-Team All-Pro. He has surpassed 1,000 yards every season of his career except one. He had 869 yards in 2021, but missed multiple games.\n\nIn four seasons with the Eagles, he has 5,034 yards and 32 touchdowns in the regular season. He could make the Bills an even bigger threat to the Patriots in the AFC East.\n\nThe Patriots are also contenders to land Brown if he is traded. They do not need him as badly as other teams, but his connection to Mike Vrabel certainly makes the Patriots a landing spot.\n\nFormer Patriots Receiver Defends Josh Allen After Bills’ Playoff Exit",

    "fullText": "Liam Rosenior is still putting his squad together at Chelsea, and there are players who are making a strong early impression.\n\nThe move for a new centre-back appears to be gathering momentum.\n\nThe pursuit of Jeremy Jacquet has advanced today, with reports suggesting that Chelsea have agreed personal terms with the defender. However, there may be an issue over the fee, which stands at £60 million.\n\nEven so, it is encouraging to see investment in a position that needed strengthening, especially after initial plans had been to wait until summer.\n\nChelsea will also want to avoid any major departures during January as they continue building under Rosenior. The focus remains on adding depth rather than losing key pieces mid-season.\n\nNothing ever seems set in stone at Chelsea, but for the moment, things are looking positive for Enzo Fernandez.\n\nParis Saint-Germain have shown interest and made an approach, but even they know pulling him away from Stamford Bridge will not be easy.\n\nRosenior has made it clear how much he values Fernandez. After the win against Brentford, he shared his thoughts on the Argentine star: “So impressed. I knew what an outstanding player he was. It’s not until you see a player up close to see what he’s all about. He’s a winner.\n\n“It’s his birthday today so I told him he should go to a steakhouse and enjoy some Argentine steak. He’s an important player.”\n\nEnzo Fernandez has taken big steps forward in his attacking play over the last year.\n\nSince the start of the previous season, he has been involved in 36 goals across all competitions – more than any other Chelsea player, even Cole Palmer.\n\nThis campaign, he has already matched his best-ever total with six Premier League goals.\n\nIn 2025, he created more chances (51) than anyone else at the club and spent most of the year leading the league in open-play chances created.\n\nHis showing against Brentford was another reminder of how much he contributes to this side.",

    "fullText": "Braves $38M clubhouse leader, Gold Glove winner, World Series champion could retire after 2026 season originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Atlanta Braves have done fairly well this offseason, with most of their major moves coming early. However, if there is one area where the Braves can still improve, it is the starting rotation. Braves GM Alex Anthopoulos isn’t just looking for any starter — he wants someone capable of starting a playoff game in October.\n\n“We’ve explored the starting rotation, adding and getting some type of starter, whether that’s trade or signing. We’d like for it to be someone impactful, someone we think can start a playoff game,” Anthopoulos said.\n\nThe Braves are usually known for having a strong rotation, but last season was different as injuries piled up throughout the year. Looking ahead to 2026, the rotation appears to be in good shape, but it’s the years beyond that where things get interesting for Atlanta.\n\n“Beyond Spencer Strider and Spencer Schwellenbach, there are no clear locks for the Atlanta Braves rotation beyond 2026,’” HTHB’s Chase Owens wrote.\n\nOne big name to monitor beyond this season is veteran Chris Sale. With Sale nearing his 40s, it will be interesting to see how he evaluates where he is in his career once the season concludes. HTHB’s Steven Teal believes Sale could be done with baseball if he has a strong 2026 campaign.\n\n“As far as his health goes, Atlanta's training staff, along with Sale making some lifestyle changes, has helped keep him on the field successfully. As mentioned above, his rib injury was just a freak thing as he made a great diving play against the Mets, hoping for a complete game. Had that injury not occurred, Sale would have likely completed the season and thrown over 170 innings again. There's no reason to believe he won't be as good this season for the Braves. If he pitches well enough, he could complete his career,” Teal wrote.\n\nWhile losing Sale would undoubtedly hurt, the veteran starter has put together an outstanding career and has little left to prove. During his time with the Braves, he has largely silenced critics who labeled him as injury-prone.\n\nSale has also been a valuable mentor in the clubhouse and within the pitching staff, but there is a real possibility that this season could be the end of the line for him. If so, the Braves may soon be saying goodbye to one of their most respected clubhouse leaders.",

    "fullText": "Manchester City Women made light work of Bournemouth as they cruised into the fifth round of the FA Cup. Bunny Shaw opened the scoring before three goals in four minutes from Lauren Hemp and a double by Laura Coombs, sent City in 4-0 up at the interval. Vivianne Miedema got on the scoresheet with a second-half brace as Andree Jeglertz’ side extended their unbeaten run to 16 games in all competitions.\n\nCity had struggled last weekend against Everton in their first match after the international break, but ultimately came away with a 2-0 victory to remain top of the WSL. But there were no such problems against the National League South side, although the Cherries did pose City some problems at the start, with Jenna Markham trying her luck, with Khiara Keating saving well.\n\nCity then began to show their WSL quality and it was no surprise when Bunny Shaw headed the Blues in front in the 19th minute. Leila Ouahabi’s brilliant cross into the box was perfect for Shaw, and the Jamaican powered home a header to give City the lead.\n\nThe Blues continued to press but Bournemouth, despite being a goal down, were holding their own, and they would have been happy going into the break just a goal down. However, a flurry of goals in the space of four minutes ended any hopes of a comeback. Lauren Hemp drilled into the bottom right corner, before Coombs hit a two-minute brace to effectively put the Blues into the fifth round.\n\nMiedema got in on the act in the 58th minute, soon after Yui Hasegawa thundered a shot against the bar, tapping into an empty net thanks to a fortuitous deflection off Lily Murphy. The Dutch striker then put the Cherries to bed and one on the cake as she thumped home in the 85th minute.\n\nIn the end it was a routine victory for Jeglertz’s side and City will now go into their League Cup Tie with Chelsea on Wednesday full of confidence and eager to test themselves against the current WSL champions, in preparation for their upcoming tussle in the WSL at the beginning of February.\n\nFinal Score: Bournemouth Women 0-6 Manchester City Women",

    "description": "Uecker passed away a year ago this weekend. To honor his memory, here are some of my favorite stories.",
    "fullText": "Legendary announcer Bob Uecker, the voice of the Milwaukee Brewers for over 50 years, passed away a year ago on Friday. Uecker was widely regarded as one of the greatest sports announcers ever. He also had a knack for sharing — and, through his actions, creating — funny, often self-deprecating stories.\n\nIn the spirit of keeping his memory alive, I wanted to compile a few of my favorites. If I missed one of your favorites, drop it in the comments.\n\n“In 1962, I was named Minor League Player of the Year. It was my second season in the bigs.”\n\n“One time, I got pulled over at 4 a.m. I was fined $75 for being intoxicated and $400 for being with the Phillies.”\n\n“I led the league in go get ’em next time.”\n\n“I led the league in hit-by-pitches one year. That’s because I couldn’t get out of the way.”\n\n“They told me to block the plate. I laid down. That seemed safest.”\n\n“I was so bad, they once traded me for myself.”\n\n“The only way I could make the team was because I knew where the beer was kept.”\n\n“The highlight of my career was getting out of the bullpen without falling down.”\n\n“Career highlights? I had two. I got an intentional walk from Sandy Koufax, and I got out of a rundown against the Mets.”\n\n“If a guy hits .300 every year, what does he have to look forward to? I always tried to stay around .190, with three or four RBI. And I tried to get them all in September. That way I always had something to talk about during the winter.”\n\n“I thought silence meant I was fired. Then I realized baseball already has enough pauses. I just filled the funny ones.”\n\n“My baseball card had my picture on the front and my career statistics on the back. That way you could turn it over and laugh twice.”\n\n“I knew when my career was over. In 1965, my baseball card came out with no picture.”\n\nOn his favorite aspect of playing professional baseball:\n\n“It was the free food. I hit .200 but ate like an All-Star.”\n\n“I used to get sore after games. Now I get sore watching them.”\n\n“I Hope That Guy Puts His Shirt On”\n\n“I have no recollection of what year this was, where the Brewers were playing, or any other context. All I remember is that we’re returning from the commercial break, Uecker is welcoming us back into the booth saying something like ‘Welcome back to [Whatever Stadium we’re in] the score is [Whatever].‘ Then, apropos of nothing, ‘Man! I hope that guy puts his shirt back on.’\n\nTo be clear: Uecker had not mentioned this shirtless buffoon before in the broadcast, or brought him up afterward. He just was annoyed by a guy, and he wanted us all to know about it.\n\n“You know, everybody remembers their first game in the major leagues. For me it was in Milwaukee. My hometown, born and raised there, and I can remember walking out on the field and Birdie Tebbetts was our manager at that time. And my family was there: my mother and dad, and all my relatives. And as I’m standing on the field, everybody’s pointing at me and waving and laughing, and I’m pointing back. And Tebbetts came up and asked me if I was nervous or uptight about the game. And I said, ‘I’m not. I’ve been waiting five years to get here. I’m ready to go.’\n\nHe said, ‘Well, we’re gonna start you today. I didn’t want to tell you earlier. I didn’t want you to get too fired up.’\n\nI said, ‘Look, I’m ready to go.’\n\nHe said, ‘Well, great, you’re in there. And oh, by the by, the rest of us up here wear that supporter on the inside.’ That was the first game my folks walked out on, too.”\n\nFrom Brewers broadcaster Lane Grindle:\n\n“Usinger’s Famous Sausage is a big sponsor on the radio and another sponsor is Cedar Crest Ice Cream. A lot of our messaging combines the two of them. They deliver a lot of their products to the booth. One night on the air, Ueck was talking about how we had some sherbet that we had had out, and we were trying it earlier in the day. And then he says, ‘You know, as a matter of fact, I think it’s so good you could put it on a sausage and it would be good.’ It kind of devolved into, like, well, let’s all try this … Let’s actually put sherbet on a brat and eat it tonight, taste test it and then report on air how it is. It was raspberry sherbet, and we used it like it was mustard or ketchup. Honestly, it wasn’t bad. We all kind of liked it.”\n\nFrom former Brewers broadcaster Jim Powell:\n\n“This would never happen with any other partner that I would ever have.\n\nWe would just get on the bus to go to the stadium, you know, 3:30 in the afternoon, for a 7 p.m. game. We were in Montreal to play the Expos. I don’t know why he saw that as like a clean palette on which he could go to town, but he did. So on the bus ride, he would start reading the billboards, you know as the bus was passing along, and he sort of developed a character, just goofing off on the bus rides. This happened over multiple years. After a while, it became pretty refined. Like, he was really funny with this character. So I had to do a pregame interview for every game. And I asked him, ‘Hey, what do you think about if I interview you on the pregame show, and you’re in that character? ’And he’s like, ‘No, no, no, I’m not doing it for that.’ I said, ‘That’s fine; it doesn’t have to go on the air. What if we just do an interview just for us to laugh at?’ Under that circumstance, he was fine with it.\n\nSo we did this interview, and out of nowhere, I just plucked what I thought was a French Canadian type of name, Jean Jacques Smythe. So I do this interview with Jean Jacques Smythe, who was, as I labeled him in the interview, a renowned French Canadian journalist, highly esteemed, blah, blah, blah. When we start, he did something he had never done on the bus. He became completely hostile. He started ripping me. He was ripping the commissioner of baseball, (former Brewers owner) Bud Selig. Anybody he could think of. He was anti-everything. For whatever reason, that’s the way he took the character in this interview. Of course, the best part was he began to rip himself. And it was absolutely hysterical.”\n\nYou can find (one of) the Jean Jacques Smythe interviews here.\n\n“After each game, I would be doing the postgame show on radio. He would be packing up his suitcase and preparing to leave the booth. His big goal was to try to get me to laugh out loud, on the air, while I am doing out-of-town scores or recapping, playing highlights from the Brewers game we just did. And it was absolutely hysterical the things he would do. He would, for example, stand right behind me, and make a sound. Like a wounded seal or a wounded dog. He would bark. Ar roof. Ar roof. Ar roof.\n\nSometimes he would use props. I’m live on the air broadcasting, and I’m trying to maintain my composure and be a professional. One time, he said, ‘Hey, Pat, look over here.’ And I knew it was going to be something bizarre. I turned around and there’s pretzels sticking out of both of his ears.\n\nThat was his big goal, to try to get me to laugh out loud. Once I laughed, then he’d say, ‘OK, see you tomorrow.’”\n\nFrom former Brewers catcher and current announcer Bill Schroeder:\n\n“This is an example of how Ueck can relate to just about anybody, I mean, presidents and pillars of industry and just a guy on the street. We would go to dinner in Pittsburgh and people would come up to him, and it was not easy being Ueck. Everybody expected him to be on his game, right? He had to be funny. But this one time after a game in Pittsburgh, Ueck was in the Fish Market, which was the bar at the hotel where we were staying at. It just so happened that the furries were in town. You know, the people that dressed up in these animal outfits? So I walk into the Fish Market and I see Bob Uecker sitting at the bar, and he’s having a conversation with a guy dressed up in a horse head. And the person next to him was in a cat suit. Ueck was like, talking to Trigger, and, you know, Felix the Cat is right next to him. He’s having a conversation with these guys like no big deal.\n\nAnd that, it’s an image that I’ll never forget. It’s just an example of how Ueck could just take a situation and make it fun and not make it uncomfortable. And he did that for thousands and thousands of people, and that’s one thing I’m really going to miss about Ueck.”",

    "fullText": "Former Chelsea player and manager Ruud Gullit has questioned whether Stamford Bridge is the right place for Jorrel Hato to develop.\n\nChelsea signed Hato from Ajax last summer in a deal worth an initial £35.5m, with the Dutch international regarded as one of the best young defenders in Europe.\n\nHato was signed to provide much needed back-up to Marc Cucurella at left back, and he’s filled a vital gap in the squad.\n\nHato has made 14 appearances in all competitions this season, but was used sparingly under former head coach Enzo Maresca.\n\nHowever, the 19-year-old has featured in all three games under Liam Rosenior, and on early evidence seems to be trusted more by the Englishman.\n\nHato scored his first goal against Charlton. (Photo by Julian Finney/Getty Images)\n\nHato scored his first goal for the club against Charlton, and it will be interesting to see what opportunities he gets over the second half of the season.\n\nRosenior was impressed by what he saw from Hato against Charlton, but Gullit has questioned whether Chelsea is the right place for his development.\n\n“I had doubts about his transfer to Chelsea,” he told Tribal Football.\n\n“He was one of the best young players in Holland, and sometimes it’s better to stay longer and gain experience.\n\n“He was captain at Ajax at such a young age, but Ajax were struggling. He escaped a difficult situation at Ajax.\n\n“He saw it coming and thought it was the right time to leave. I don’t know if Chelsea is the right club for his development.”\n\nWhilst one young defender in Hato is continuing to settle in at Chelsea, the Blues are looking to add another in Jeremy Jacquet.\n\nRuud Gullit questions if Chelsea is “right club” for “development” of £35.5m Blues ace\n\n“Talks taking place” – Fabrizio Romano shares transfer update on €20m Chelsea star\n\nRomano: Chelsea “agreed personal terms” with top target, negotiating team already in France\n\nChelsea have changed their transfer plans and are looking to bring in a centre back this month, and have identified Jacquet as their main target.\n\nThe Blues have reportedly agreed personal terms with Jacquet, but Rennes want €65m for the 20-year-old, whilst Chelsea aren’t prepared to spend that much currently.",

    "title": "MMA Mania’s 2025 BJJ Awards: Best Male Grapplers of the Year",
    "description": "Here are BJJ’s top male grapplers of 2025.",
    "fullText": "2025 has been a banner year for Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ), as the sport rapidly grows and more opportunities are available for athletes in the professional grappling scene. We’re going over some of the best performances and top milestones of the year, as we unveil the winners of the 2025 BJJ Awards here at MMA Mania.\n\nFollowing up on our Submission, Event, Breakthrough Grappler, Promotion, and Female Grappler of the Year awards, our final category tackles the best male grapplers of 2025.\n\nThis award isn’t necessarily given to the highest ranked or most skilled grappler, but who we believe had the best year in 2025. There were several elite grapplers that put on great performances throughout the year, but here are the top grapplers that stood out the most.\n\nDiego “Pato” Oliveira and Adam Wardzinski both had an incredible year, as the two BJJ stars took gold at all four major gi events (IBJJF Worlds, Pans, Brasileiros and Euros) in 2025 to win IBJJF Grand Slam honors.\n\nPato won his 6th IBJJF world title across gi and no gi, and also had one WNO title defense over Keith Krikorian last year. Wardzinski won back to back world titles in 2024 and 2025, before retiring from the IBJJF circuit in the best way possible. They have good cases to be ranked higher, as they’re world champs and legitimately among the top pound-for-pound best today. They arguably had better years though and they each sustained upset losses in the few high paying (for BJJ) professional tournaments they joined.\n\nPato and Wardzinski are so good and both operate on such high expectations that those rare losses actually elevated the careers of two breakhrough athletes.\n\nDeclan Moody had a huge year, where he rose from a promising BJJ prospect to legitimately one of the best heavyweights on the planet. Moody’s game seems to have significantly improved in 2025, and the results speak for themselves. With his great passing, movement and quickness for his size, the 29-year-old B-Team product was dominant in several key tournaments and professional events.\n\nIn 2025, Moody beat five men to win CJI 2 Trials, submitted Fellipe Andrew at WNO 28, then dominated Ryan Aitken and Ethan Crelinsten at CJI 2. A week later, and he beat Marcin Maciulewicz and four others to win another ADCC Trials gold medal.\n\nMoody then capped off the year by winning the WNO Open Weight Grand Prix title. He has a legitimate case to be ranked higher, but either way, Moody clearly had one of the best showings in 2025 due to his vastly improved game.\n\n2025 was absolutely massive for Andrew Tackett’s career.\n\nHe started the year with a heel hook win at WNO 27, before eventually joining UFC BJJ and being part of their “Road to the Title” reality show. Tackett beat Aaron Wilson, Jason Nolf and Andy Varela to win the promotion’s inaugural welterweight belt, and followed up with two title defenses over Renato Canuto and Elijah Dorsey to end the year.\n\nAll six of those pro wins were by submission, with Tackett not only living up to his reputation for must watch entertainment, but also growing to become the face of UFC BJJ, along with Mikey Musumeci.\n\nSince becoming a fan-favorite after his 2024 loss to Kade Ruotolo at CJI 1, Tackett took full advantage of the UFC marketing machine and became one of the biggest stars in the entire sport in 2025. Others on this list may technically have more top ranked wins, but Tackett easily had one of the biggest career jumps in 2025.\n\nIn 2025, Dorian Olivarez made a massive leap from teen prodigy to elite BJJ talent.\n\nOlivarez was one of the standouts at the biggest BJJ event of the year. While it went down on his official record as draws due to CJI 2’s team grappling rules, Olivarez clearly dominated three BJJ champions in Ethan Crelinsten, Taylor Pearman and Felipe Pena.\n\nPearman is an ADCC Trials champ at 88 kg (194 lbs) and came in at 99 kg (218 lbs) for CJI 2, while Pena is the reigning ADCC heavyweight champion (over 99 kg). Olivarez was around 70-80 lbs lighter, further highlighting just how insane those performances were.\n\nIn his own 66 kg division, Olivarez also won gold at arguably the most stacked ADCC Trials bracket of the year, which had 130 competitors. He beat seven men in one day, which included submission wins over Julian Espinosa and Gavin Corbe.\n\nIn 2025, Olivarez dominated much larger, elite champions at the star-studded CJI 2 event, and he also became a rare two-time ADCC Trials champ — all before even turning 20-years-old.\n\nDespite his young age, Olivarez technically doesn’t qualify for our Breakthrough Grappler of the Year award due to his previous ADCC Trials win (like Declan Moody above). He still did more than enough to win the biggest recognition on our 2025 BJJ Awards though.\n\nWith his incredible 2025, Dorian Olivarez is our Male Grappler of the Year.\n\nFor the latest Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ) and grappling-related news click here. For additional grappling content, follow @BJJBeat on Instagram.",

    "description": "Packers fans will be hoping that old friend Davante Adams can help bring the Bears’ season to an end.",
    "fullText": "Green Bay Packers fans saw their team bomb out of the playoffs last Saturday, giving up 25 fourth-quarter points to the Chicago Bears in a brutal 31-27 loss. With that result, the Bears advanced to this weekend’s Divisional Playoffs, where they face a Los Angeles Rams team that is, in the eyes of many NFL analysts, the best team in the NFL.\n\nThe Rams had to scrape and claw their way to a win in their own Wild Card game, however, scoring a late touchdown to defeat the Carolina Panthers 34-31 on the road. That game saw those two teams trade scores throughout the fourth quarter, but it was Matthew Stafford’s connection to Colby Parkinson with 38 seconds left that proved to be the difference.\n\nPackers fans would surely love to see an old friend knock the Bears out of the postseason, however. Davante Adams is the #2 option in the Rams’ passing game behind Puka Nacua, and tonight’s game would be a perfect time for Adams to deliver a classic performance. In 17 career games against the Bears (16 with the Packers and one with the Raiders), Adams has totaled 88 catches for 1,081 yards and ten touchdowns — a very solid full season’s worth of numbers.\n\nAdams’ last game against the Bears while wearing green and gold came in December of 2021. In that contest, he roasted Chicago’s secondary with 10 receptions, 121 yards, and two touchdowns. His only better game against Chicago was in late 2016, when he caught 13 balls for 132 and two scores. All told, Adams had four 100-yard games when playing the Bears. If he can do anything like that again tonight, the Rams should be headed to the NFC Championship.\n\nOf course, that game comes after the AFC’s 2-5 matchup, which puts one of the league’s best defenses in the Houston Texans against the potential MVP, Patriots quarterback Drake Maye. That should be a fun game to watch as a relatively neutral observer before turning into big-time Rams fans for the final game of the weekend.\n\nJoin us in the comments to discuss both games!\n\nGame Time: 3:00 PM Eastern Time (2:00 PM Central)\nTV Channel: ESPN & ABC\nCommentators: Joe Buck, Troy Aikman\nPoint spread: Patriots -3\n\nGame Time: 5:30 PM Central Time\nTV Channel: NBC\nCommentators: Mike Tirico, Cris Collinsworth\nPoint spread: Rams -3.5",

    "fullText": "The Miami Hurricanes head into the College Football Playoff national championship game with some pretty good news on the injury front. Elija Lofton has been ruled out, and Damari Brown appears to be trending towards a game time decision, but every other contributor avoided being on the availability report and appears good to go, including Ahmad Moten, Sr., Akheem Mesidor, and OJ Frederique.\n\nHowever, thanks to college football’s own controversial rule, the Hurricanes’ defense will still have to try to hold the Indiana Hoosiers in check without one of their most important players – starting cornerback Xavier Lucas.\n\nLucas was flagged for targeting in the second half of Miami’s 31-27 win over Ole Miss in the Fiesta Bowl. He hit Ole Miss WR Cayden Lee with his shoulder, but the contact occurred to Lee’s head, and Lucas was sent to the showers.\n\nIt’s not being talked about enough how ridiculous it is that Xavier Lucas has to sit out the first half of the title game because he tried to tackle the lower body of a receiver being led into him by his QB as the WR twisted his body down into his helmet.pic.twitter.com/oT3F5l3lnr\n\n— David Furones (@DavidFurones_) January 16, 2026\n\nBased on the NCAA’s rule, Lucas is suspended for the first half of Monday night’s clash with the Indiana Hoosiers. It feels like a heavy and unfair penalty because it is, particularly given it wasn’t an intentional and egregious hit. At some point as a defender, you have to commit to going into a hit, and a wide receiver’s body position changes in a millisecond, and some guys just miss. This was an example of exactly that. Now, as a result of playing football, Lucas will be watching with his helmet in his hand for the first 30 minutes.\n\nMario Cristobal was asked about the hit on Sunday morning at his joint press conference with Indiana’s Curt Cignetti, and he feels as though the rule should be revisited.\n\n“Certainly do. We feel it was unjustly administered, and now it impacts the last game of the season. We do have the ability, again, as an officiating crew and the powers that be to revisit that to give every team due process and their best ability to compete in this game.“\n\nIndiana’s offense is a handful, with Omar Cooper, Jr. Elijah Sarratt, and Charlie Becker forming a terrific trio of pass catchers. Miami is being severely hamstrung by this rule. Hopefully for Miami’s sakes, they can continue to control the game on offense early on with long, sustained drives and keep Indiana’s offense on the sideline.\n\nBecause if they don’t, an already extremely tough offense will be even tougher for the Hurricanes to stop. And on the game’s biggest stage, that’s a real shame.",

    "fullText": "Alex Pereira took a shot at UFC legend Jon Jones, and he got a response.\n\nPereira, current UFC light heavyweight champion and one of the biggest names in MMA today, has been making the rounds on social media due to him going back to the tire shop he used to work at in Brazil prior to his explosion to fame in UFC. Not only is it a rags-to-riches story that has captivated the MMA world, but \"Poatan\" made sure to spice things up. He posted a video of a tire that had written, \"Jon Jones next\" with a hammer next to it that had \"Poatan\" on it.\n\nThis not only got the attention of fans, but also Jones himself.\n\n\"I've beat a lot of legends from your country, my friend. I know you'd love to avenge the boys, but boy would you be a good one to add to my list. Be careful what you wish for. Chama.\"\n\nJon Jones sent a warning to Alex Pereira 😬 https://t.co/eq7a9n1etE pic.twitter.com/2EaHKXr1sc\n\n— Happy Punch (@HappyPunch) January 18, 2026\n\nFriction between Jones and Pereira is nothing new. This is the latest of years of the two publicly showing interest in fighting each other. Talks of a potential bout between the two were at the highest when Jones defended the UFC heavyweight crown against Stipe Miocic in November 2024, and Pereira held the UFC light heavyweight belt. In the end, the highly-anticipated superfight never materialized with Jones vacating his belt and retiring, just to unretire a few months later.\n\nThere's been talk of a potential fight between the two at the UFC's expected event at The White House in June. Jones claims he's out of retirement, and Pereira still holds the UFC light heavyweight belt after losing it and re-gaining it in 2025 in a two-fight series with Magomed Ankalaev.\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: Jon Jones responds to Alex Pereira's online shot: 'Be careful'",

    "fullText": "Viktor Onopko is regarded as one of the most gifted footballers Russia has produced. He was a footballing icon for the country, especially in the 90s.\n\nCurrently serving as the assistant manager of the Russian national football team, Onopko has raised a few eyebrows with his statement about Barcelona.\n\nIn a recent interview with El Bigote de Abadía, Onopko revealed that he was linked to Barcelona at one point in his career. But he accused Barça of not signing him because he was ‘ugly’.\n\nOnopko arrived in Spain in 1996, signing for Real Oviedo. He spent six years at Oviedo, featuring in 222 competitive matches before joining Rayo Vallecano in 2002.\n\nA centre-back by trade, Onopko played for Vallecano for just one year before returning to his native Russia, signing for Spartak Alania. He eventually retired in 2006.\n\n“I signed with Oviedo in the summer of 1995, but then I went in the winter. I wanted to put a clause that if a club put in one more dollar, I could go to that club.\n\nOnopko claims he was rejected by Barcelona due to aesthetic reasons. (Photo by Firo Foto/Getty Images)\n\n“They told me yes, but they deceived me. Because Atleti made an offer for me, but I couldn’t go to Atleti,” Onopko began (h/t Forbes).\n\nHowever, the footballer revealed that he was a subject of interest for Barcelona as well, but one of the assistant coaches found him ugly.\n\n“I recently found out that Barcelona wanted to sign me. But [Johan] Cruyff or one of his assistants said I was ugly, and that’s why they didn’t sign me,” he said.\n\nAlthough the move did not work out for Onopko, he still ended up as a hero in La Liga, featuring in over 200 matches in the Spanish top-flight while representing the Russian national team 109 times.\n\nAged 56, Onopko has started his coaching career as well and is currently serving as an assistant for Valeriy Karpin for the Russian national team while simultaneously working as an assistant coach for FC Rostov.",

    "description": "North Carolina’s defense is unraveling, losses are piling up and Hubert Davis is under increasing scrutiny as ACC play nears.",
    "fullText": "North Carolina’s season is unraveling before the heart of ACC play even arrives, and Hubert Davis is suddenly facing the most scrutiny of his tenure in Chapel Hill.\n\nAlthough North Carolina is 14-4 on the season, which isn’t terrible, the Tar Heels have lost three of their last four games, including an 84-78 loss to Cal that saw the Bears shoot 50% from the field (29-for-58) and a blistering 62.5% from 3-point range (10-for-16). It marked the fourth straight game the Tar Heels have surrendered at least 40% from beyond the arc. Since the start of ACC play, opponents have hit 72 3-pointers against UNC, an average of 14.4 per game.\n\nThe Tar Heels’ terrible defensive play isn’t going to get any better soon, especially with North Carolina yet to reach the heart of ACC play. And given the expectations placed on Carolina going into the season, it could be Hubert Davis’ last season as head coach.\n\nThat’s what many Carolina fans are saying and thinking, and it’s not unreasonable to do so given the amount of expectations on the Tar Heels entering the season — or every season.\n\nHowever, Davis’ seat isn’t hot, but it’s definitely past 80 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nFor starters, Carolina spent $14 million for this season’s roster that includes Luka Bogavac, Kyan Evans, Henri Veesaar and, of course, Carolina’s freshman phenom Caleb Wilson.\n\nWhile Veesaar and Wilson are arguably the ACC’s best backcourt duo, Bogavac and Evans aren’t in the starting lineup anymore because of their struggles of late.\n\nAnd the Tar Heels’ lackluster defense, which has already cost them games — and potentially many more — is giving Davis’ detractors more reasons to say he shouldn’t be the head man in Chapel Hill.\n\nThe larger issue is the pattern. Davis’ first team stumbled through much of 2021-22 before catching fire, upsetting Duke in Coach K’s final home game and riding a Cinderella run to the national title game. A year later, North Carolina opened as the preseason No. 1 and ended as the first team in that spot to miss the NCAA Tournament since the field expanded in 1985.\n\nIn 2023-24, the Tar Heels regrouped, starting at No. 19, winning the ACC regular-season title and reaching the Sweet 16. Last season, they began at No. 9, faded to unranked and barely reached the NCAA field through the First Four in Dayton.\n\nIt’s a résumé defined by wild swings — something Duke under Jon Scheyer and Virginia under Ryan Odom haven’t shared — and Carolina appears stuck, if not slipping backward.\n\nThe lack of consistency is not what Tar Heels fans want. It’s never easy to replace a legend like Roy Williams, especially for a first-time head coach like Davis.\n\nHowever, Duke’s transition from Mike Krzyzewski to Jon Scheyer has been like nothing changed. Scheyer led the Blue Devils to the Final Four last season, and every year the Blue Devils have gotten better.\n\nVirginia has also bounced back extremely quickly under Ryan Odom, and it looks like the Cavaliers are the second-best team in the conference after Duke.\n\nCarolina is not moving forward. It’s either staying in the same place or going backward.\n\nIt’s pretty simple why he’s not on the hot seat just yet: The Tar Heels are 14-4, and there are still plenty of games left.\n\nCollege basketball is a weird sport, and we have seen teams play subpar basketball and take it up a notch as the season goes along.\n\nTwo great examples of this are North Carolina’s 1997 Final Four and 2022 Final Four squads.\n\nThe 1997 squad, one that had Vince Carter and Antawn Jamison, started off the season 12-6 before going on a 16-game winning streak and advancing to the Final Four as a No. 1 seed. That team also won four straight games against ranked opponents to close out the regular season, which included wins over Tim Duncan-led No. 4 Wake Forest and No. 7 Duke.\n\nThe 2022 team spent most of the season unranked and even lost to an 11-21 Pitt team, giving the Tar Heels an 18-8 record. However, UNC followed the loss to Pitt with a five-game winning streak to end the regular season, including its shocking win over Duke in Coach K’s final home game in Cameron Indoor Stadium. That kick-started its Cinderella run to the national championship that season.\n\nWhile Davis’ coaching ability is being questioned right now, the Tar Heels have a lot of time to fix issues that are largely fixable. And while his tenure has been inconsistent, a lot of programs around the country would kill for Davis’ first four years at the helm.\n\nHowever, time is beginning to run out, and tension is starting to arise in the Southern Part of Heaven.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Tar Heels Wire: UNC Basketball: Is Hubert Davis on the hot seat?",

Talks between the two clubs are ongoing as they attempt to structure a deal that satisfies Verona’s valuation.\n\nGiovane, who has registered three goals and four assists in 20 Serie A appearances this season, is expected to command a fee in the region of €15-18m.\n\nLazio’s hope is that the inclusion of Belahyane could lower that figure and allow them to move decisively ahead of rivals such as Inter, Napoli and Juventus.",

    "fullText": "The Cleveland Browns head coach search continues on with second interviews getting scheduled, and at least two candidates are now off the list. There was a report Saturday that Green Bay Packers DC Jeff Hafley had interviewed by the Browns and was a “likely finalist” for multiple jobs, but the team has not confirmed that candidate.\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nSo far, there have been reports that Cleveland DC Jim Schwartz and Baltimore Ravens OC Todd Monken will receive second interviews. The Browns have interviewed a slew of younger candidates for the vacant head coaching position, with Schwartz and Monken by far the most veteran of the interviewees.\n\nOn Sunday, news broke that the final and youngest candidate to interview for the position, Jacksonville Jaguars OC Grant Udinski, will also get a second interview:\n\nThe Browns will interview Jaguars OC Grant Udinski in-person this week as they move to the second round of interviews, per source. \n\nThe 30-year-old joins Browns DC Jim Schwartz and former Ravens OC Todd Monken, among others, in Round 2. pic.twitter.com/Dhs20dF2sC\n\n— Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) January 18, 2026\n\nIf hired, Udinski would be the youngest head coach of all time in the NFL by almost a full year. Los Angeles Rams HC Sean McVay currently holds that mark at 30 years and 353 days. Having just turned 30 years old last week, Udkinski would break that record by over 300 days if hired in this cycle.\n\nYou can hear Udinski here talking about his role with the Minnesota Vikings before heading to Jacksonville:\n\nI interviewed #Jaguars OC Grant Udinski before the season about his rise. Here he is discussing everything he learned with the Vikings under Kevin O’Connell.\n\nUdinski, just 30 years old, is now a finalist for the #Browns HC job.\n\n(Full interview is here: https://t.co/oobsYh4eg6) pic.twitter.com/8viGIcOdPo\n\n— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) January 18, 2026\n\nBesides Udinski, Cincinnati Bengals OC Dan Pitcher, former Miami Dolphins HC Mike McDaniel, and Hafley are the only known candidates who are not still coaching in the playoffs. That could delay Cleveland getting others in for in-person interviews this week.\n\nDo you read into Udinski being added to the second interview list a day after his first interview? If you had to choose between the very veteran options (Schwartz, Monken) or one of the younger guys, like Udinski, do you have a general age/experience-related preference?\n\nShare your head coach search thoughts in the comment section below",

    "title": "At This Office Park, Scamming the World Was the Business",
    "description": "Times journalists got a rare look inside one of the compounds where the online fraud industry makes its billions. Inspirational slogans (“Keep going”) were just the start.",
    "fullText": "Reporting from Min Let Pan, Myanmar\n\nIn a Southeast Asian war zone, cloaked in dense rainforest, the Chinese settlement dedicated to scamming people from Kentucky to Kazakhstan grew fast on fertile ground.\n\nOver just a few months, a sprawling office park materialized and metastasized in the chaotic borderlands of Myanmar, with cavernous rooms holding rows of computer monitors and walls decorated with inspirational work slogans: “Dream chaser,” “Keep going,” “Making money matters the most.” In video conference suites, bookshelves stocked with fake business tomes and ersatz modern art simulated the kind of boardroom a successful crypto investor might inhabit.\n\nThe scam center, Shunda Park, opened for business in 2024 with more than 3,500 workers from nearly 30 nations, including Namibia, Russia, Zimbabwe and France. Some had been kidnapped and enslaved, but all had become skilled in the art of the online grift. When the scammers bilked $5,000 out of someone, they struck a Chinese gong. A $50,000 shakedown earned a celebratory pounding of a giant drum, then an offering to a Chinese deity resplendent in his golden altar.\n\nWhile each nationality required a different approach — for Americans, one scammer told me, the preferred mark was “white old men” — the general approach was the same: an online foray by a sympathetic and attractive person, followed by an invitation to participate in a select investment opportunity.\n\nVictims were not just lonely hearts or technologically timid retirees. Using generative intelligence and deepfake videos, as well as fraudulent businesses, websites and financial apps, the scammers at Shunda embraced the long con and reeled in people from almost every demographic.\n\nBut in late November, Shunda Park was unexpectedly captured by a rebel force long at odds with the Myanmar military, whose coup nearly five years ago catapulted this Southeast Asian nation into civil war and created a chaotic space for criminality to thrive. The photographer Jes Aznar and I were granted rare access to the scam compound to document the inner sanctum of this secretive, highly fortified industry. Shunda Park had been closed for business by the rebel militia, but we were able to meet some of its scammers, both those who were trying to return home and others who wanted to find another job in the fraud business.\n\nWith millions of people falling victim to online shakedowns every year, the cyberscamming industry has quickly grown into one of the planet’s most lucrative criminal enterprises, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.\n\nIn the United States alone, in 2024, at least $10 billion was stolen through cyberscams run out of Southeast Asia, the U.S. Treasury Department said. That figure is likely only a fraction of the true toll because victims are often too embarrassed to admit they have been fooled. Late last year, the United States formed its first ever federal task force to combat scam centers and the Chinese transnational crime networks that American investigators say run them.\n\nThe Myanmar junta, which has imprisoned members of an elected government and killed thousands of civilians, recently vowed to tackle the scam networks. But its current crackdown feels like a Potemkin exercise. The global profits from online cons rival the gross domestic products of the countries where the fraud factories have proliferated, including Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos.\n\nThese illicit proceeds do not just line the pockets of the gangs, most of which are originally from China; dirty money also flows to powerful elites across the region — most of all, crime-watchers say, to powerful people in the conflict-ridden, failed state of Myanmar.\n\nOur journey to Shunda Park occurred during what was supposed to be a lull in the fighting between the Myanmar military and the opposition militia, known as the Karen National Liberation Army. (The Karen, pronounced Kuh-REN, are one of Myanmar’s many ethnic groups that have been persecuted by the military for generations.)\n\nWhat we discovered inside Shunda Park’s thick walls ringed by razor wire resembled a set for an apocalyptic film. Amid white office blocks, Chinese restaurants and luxury villas reserved for the compound’s Chinese bosses, bonfires burned, consuming the tools of the illicit economy. Piles of electronic equipment — keyboards, tangles of cables and thousands of cellphones — littered the site. In some buildings, with nearly every step I took, I crunched on SIM cards, scattered like snow in the tropical heat.\n\nWhile members of the Karen militia handed over armfuls of evidence to the police in Thailand, along with a man identified as the compound’s Chinese boss, no representatives of foreign governments or intelligence agencies have come to Shunda Park to investigate. Now, the fighting has intensified, and all of Shunda Park’s workers have scattered. Other proof of scamming has gone up in flames.\n\n“We are trying our best, but we are not scam experts,” said Padoh Saw Taw Nee, the spokesman for the K.N.L.A.’s political wing, as he leafed through a notebook with instructions on how to cheat middle-aged women in Taiwan. “We do not like that our land is known as the place where criminals cheat people.”\n\nThe layers of victimhood at a place like Shunda Park are complex. Many of the scammers who worked here say they were duped, too. They arrived in neighboring Thailand, thinking they had been hired for well-paying tech or marketing jobs. Others thought they were checking out merchandise for online sales businesses. Instead, they were hustled at gunpoint across the river that demarcates the border with Myanmar.\n\nI spoke with several scammers whose bodies bore scars from beatings or tight shackles. They never received payment for their 12-hour shifts, they said. Life was a Sisyphean loop: sleep, eat, scam, eat, sleep, scam.\n\nKason, a 22-year-old from Malaysia who is being identified only by his first name, said he suffered only two “hard” beatings. But his legs and torso were crisscrossed with traces of lacerations from what he called “many, many” smaller beatings.\n\nHis job for more than a year was to send endless “hellos” into the social media ether. If he did not receive responses from at least 5 percent of the greetings, then he would be punished physically, he said.\n\nIvan, a Malaysian who once worked as a member of the ground staff at the Singapore airport, said he was chained in a crucifixion position and denied food for days.\n\n“You think you know hell,” he said, “and it’s actually even worse.”\n\nIn one of the Shunda Park workrooms, bobblehead dolls and fake gold bars enlivened the space. At the front, near a statue of a Chinese god worshiped by the gangsters, were three port-a-potty style boxes that scammers said were used as punishment chambers, in clear sight of the rest of the room. Elsewhere in the compound, behind a barbecue restaurant, a row of cement torture cells was outfitted with bars and shackles.\n\nNot all the workers at Shunda landed there unwillingly. Many of the Chinese employees at Shunda Park received salaries, a review of records in one finance office shows. A company called Huisheng International, for instance, had stacks of wage receipts, sick-leave forms and medical tests for H.I.V. and syphilis, among other diseases, all written in Chinese. Employees were identified by nicknames like “Eastern Dragon” or “Little Li.” Contracts in the office specified that workers would be bound by Myanmar labor law.\n\nWhile most of the workers at Shunda Park were transported to safety via Thailand, about 900 Chinese workers refused to leave for more than two weeks, despite the compound being in the middle of an active conflict zone. The Chinese government has periodically cracked down on the scamming industry, arresting Chinese workers who are repatriated. So tense was the situation that days before our visit, some Chinese workers had tried unsuccessfully to wrestle weapons away from the Karen soldiers, according to members of the militia and other scammers who witnessed the melee.\n\nAll but one Chinese man at the compound refused to speak with me. The scammers shielded their faces with their hands or with masks. The one worker who agreed to talk said he had been promised a salary of 30,000 yuan a month, or $4,250. But upon arriving, he said, he only received 30,000 Thai baht a month, or $940. Records in the finance office showed base salaries of that amount.\n\n“They tricked me,” he said of his employers. The boom of shelling punctuated our conversation.\n\nAround him, rotten food festered. On the basketball court and by a nightclub, fires smoldered. A French bulldog that used to be cared for by one of the compound’s Chinese managers padded by, before collapsing in the shade provided by a luxury sedan. The cars on site came from all over Myanmar, including a fire department vehicle from halfway across the country. There was also an oil tanker truck with Chinese license plates.\n\nThe Myanmar military appears determined to reclaim Shunda Park, even as it dynamites buildings in other scam centers to show it is tough on crime. Workers at those raided sites, also run by Chinese criminal networks, however, say the crackdowns are just for show. In fact, some of the workers at Shunda said they had just arrived from these cleared out compounds. With international sanctions biting, Myanmar’s generals, supported by business allies and sympathetic militias, have embraced various illicit economies, making the country a global crime capital.\n\nOutside the scam compounds, life is impoverished and insecure. The Myanmar military regularly launches airstrikes around Shunda Park, and across the rest of the country, targeting civilians. More than 3.5 million people nationwide are now displaced.\n\nAs the shelling intensified, we climbed into pickup trucks and sped away. Our driver, the commander of the K.N.L.A.’s special forces, varied his speed to ward off the suicide drones that terrorize the area’s roads. A few days before, an armed drone detonated a bus length away from one of the trucks.\n\nIn the next village, in an area where an ethnic armed group aligned with the junta had held sway, I spotted more neat rows of scam centers being built, Chinese red lanterns hanging from the eaves. Chinese workers wandered through the construction site, shirts off in the heat.\n\nA few days later, the 900 or so Chinese workers left Shunda. Some went over the border to Thailand. But most headed to other Chinese compounds in the wilds of Myanmar, where scammers are busy finding their next victims.\n\nBerry Wang contributed research.",

That future has arrived. This Friday at noon we are talking about what that means and how we’ll adapt to this new normal. According to our guests, it’s going to require some serious thinking about how much water we use, how we use, and how we think about something we haven’t ever really had to think about. The real question is, do we have the cultural and political will to make the deep cuts and big changes necessary to survive if not thrive?GUESTSPaolo Bacigalupi is a Hugo and Nebula award-winning science fiction and fantasy writer.

    "fullText": "The long-running series in which readers answer other readers’ questions on subjects ranging from trivial flights of fancy to profound scientific and philosophical concepts\n\nThis week’s question: How can we learn from unrequited love?\n\nWhat’s the point of having speed limits if camera-warning signs and apps allow drivers to slow down in advance – then just continue speeding? Maybe the UK government in its new consultations on road safety should add the question of hiding speed cameras to their list of concerns. I’m a driver, but also a pedestrian and cyclist and get fed up with seeing cars zooming down local roads at way more than 20 or 30mph. There are flashing lights that tell drivers what speed they’re doing, but there’s no penalty for going over at those points. Amy, Cornwall\n\nSend new questions to nq@theguardian.com.\n\nIt’s high time the government put its foot down. EddieChorepost\n\nNo. People slow down when they see one. EGriff\n\nI’ve an idea – why don’t the authorities dig lots of holes in the road to encourage drivers to slow down (the encouragement being avoidance of severe and expensive damage to tyres, wheels and suspension). We could call them “potholes”. Oh – hang on … DocLobster1960\n\nSpeeding is antisocial behaviour, so why not make the people who do it pay into the coffers for the good of society?\n\nI don’t care whether cameras are hidden or not, people should just abide by the speed limits. It’s not as if speed limits are designed as a punishment. Goldgreen\n\nI got a speeding ticket in Wales on my first visit there after they introduced a 20mph limit, I opted to take the speed awareness course and found it to be invaluable. I suggest that all learner drivers take this course as you learn so much. I’ve been driving for 35 years and some of the things I learned have stuck with me today. It would be good if we were made aware before we started driving. I actually enjoyed the course. lozbags\n\nOf course there should be no warnings about fixed speed cameras. Mind you, this gives local residents an advantage. Tony Firshman, by email\n\nThe issue of whether speed cameras should be visible was decided by the Blair government (and the then transport minister John Spellar). Speeding motorists avoided them and continued speeding afterwards. This resulted in “crash migration”. Road safety has always been the Cinderella issue of policy and sadly, will continue to be, due to the moral bankruptcy of our politicians. Howard Bramwell, by email\n\nNo, cameras are there to slow drivers at dangerous places. However, the camera technology must be so cheap now that every (30mph) sign could have a camera behind it. I really struggle to do 20, though, because I have a muscle memory for driving in villages at 25-30mph. James M Bartlett, by email\n\nI don’t think there is clear evidence of what is more efficient in bringing accidents down, as the approach varies between countries. In Germany, speed cameras are usually hidden, behind bends or road signs. Mobile cameras are common. Sometimes, you have road signs warning of cameras (“Radar”), but they are usually quite a bit before the cameras. Mustbe6to20\n\nSpeed cameras don’t need to be hidden. They need to be ubiquitous. The want to be in every cat’s-eye in the country and round every bush and corner. Just get them in, save the lives instead of regretting them and force people to slow down.\n\nReally start the war on the motorist, and while you’re at it, make pedestrian crossing lights change immediately when someone presses the button. That’ll be the real signal for the war to begin. Andrew Riley, by email\n\nVisible. There’s a stretch of A road in north Norfolk which had two speed cameras. One has been removed – people still brake as they approach it. Visible still works best, even when it’s no longer visible. RosiesDad\n\nIt has always struck me that the use of average speed cameras (as opposed to so-called “safety cameras”) is much more effective at keeping vehicle speeds down to the speed limit. These use automatic numberplate recognition (ANPR) to check the time between cameras, so virtually all drivers stay at the speed limit but then speed up after passing the last camera (presumably to make up for the time they think they have lost while sticking to the speed limit). As ANPR spreads more widely (so we can catch the bad guys up to no good), it can’t be beyond the technology to use their data to better effect by catching speeders too. shropshirelasso\n\nNo need to hide them, they are meant to stand out, so if you are going too fast you can still slow down, but if you are going at a ridiculous speed that you don’t notice them, you then have no complaints. Like shooting fish in a barrel. Yes, there are some sneaky ones, but they are not necessary imho. Idiots end up getting caught out anyway. Damianleah\n\nI am all in favour of overt and covert ones. I am also all in favour of the police using roadside/bridge cameras to catch speeders. Further, I would welcome a tripling or more of the fines and points received, along with all drivers having to undertake a speed awareness course every five years in order to keep your licence – and don’t forget, holding a licence is a privilege and not a right.\n\nI am a driver who does far too many miles each year, and I have probably driven for more than 800,000 miles, and I have not been caught speeding. Oh, I’m not going to say I am some sort of saint, and I know I have exceeded the limit on many occasions, but if I had been caught, I would have deserved the penalty. Sallycycles\n\nSome people btl are claiming that hidden cameras wouldn’t work as a deterrent. But they would once you’ve been caught, fined and accumulated a few points. Insurance goes up and the risk of losing one’s licence should focus the mind pretty quickly. I’m sick of being tailgated when driving at the speed limit. Dropinjim\n\nSigns that tell you the speed you are doing (or a smiling face if you are doing the speed limit) are far more effective and for a greater distance afterwards at slowing people down than speed cameras. Having said that, average speed cameras seem to be a good direction to go, obviously better on long singular roads than towns with lots of roads leaving and joining, although it could still work. duncandavis\n\nWouldn’t a visible deterrent be better than letting people speed or get into an accident and have to deal with the aftermath? Patriiick\n\nYes, especially in school zones. A 2025 study in New York City showed that speed cameras reduced injuries by 16%, and collisions by 30%. Even better, Toronto Metropolitan University found that speed cameras reduced “the number of speeding vehicles by 45% in urban school zones”. RP Orlando, by email\n\nI have a, perhaps controversial, take on this. Hide the speed cameras, but don’t issue any fines to those who breach the limit. Just points on the licence. This would take away the argument from many that speed cameras are a cash cow and not a safety feature. Niels, by email\n\nIf you want to generate revenue, hide the cameras. If you want people to slow down, make them highly visible. I know very few people who haven’t been caught by a speed trap. I was going to go back to where my so-called offence took place but decided to take the cheap way out, a £100 speed awareness course that taught me nothing. I do know it was a dual carriageway with a barrier to stop pedestrians crossing the road – and a speed limit that dropped from 40 to 30 with no discernible reason. They have these cameras in Italy. They are the size of a wheelie bin and are bright orange. Guess what – no one speeds past them. The police also have radar guns but where it is important that people don’t speed, pedestrian crossings etc, the cameras do a perfect job. iptraveller\n\nIn Surrey, where I learned to drive, cameras were hidden, painted grey. When I started driving farther afield, I was amazed that anyone in the counties which had already adopted yellow painted cameras was ever caught speeding. They were so visible compared to the ones we had in Surrey. Now there are the warnings on GPS and satnavs. No excuses. WordChazer\n\nOften local authorities only put cameras at high accident sites. Average speed checks are located to stop street cruising, with limited effect. Previously I was a transport planner and had geographic information system access to all the locations and police metadata on the Stats19 forms. It is sobering to overlay all the slight, serious and fatal accidents, for all years. There is no discernible pattern – distribution of data points is everywhere. Zero accidents should be the aim. Not difficult to black box all new cars and stop speeding.\n\nAs a pedestrian, cyclist and driver I agree. I honestly believe drivers for their licence should walk down a dark country lane, cycle down an A road, deal with stupidly bright headlights. Driving is seen as a right but it’s not it’s a privilege. funkymentalist\n\nSpeed limit signs should be clearly visible, close enough together, and not faded, nor obscured by vegetation. They should not be contradictory, as they sometimes are when temporary signs are reached before permanent signs. When that has been achieved, speed cameras should be hidden. FromageBleu\n\nCould just make cars unable to exceed speed limit. Very easy to do. Or fit them all with black boxes. Seamusheaneyisbrown\n\nFrom July 2024 all new cars sold in the EU [and Northern Ireland] are required to have speed limiters. Wantage\n\nNo. I don’t think speed cameras should be hidden. That does not deter people speeding, it just gives them a ticket. The whole point is to slow people down.\n\nAnother aspect of road safety that bugs me a great deal is tailgating. This is a very serious offence in Florida. (I don’t know about the rest of the US.) It is up there with drink-driving, and in my opinion it should be because it is very dangerous, and causes some of the worst accidents on motorways.\n\nHopefully with AI, they can invent a camera which picks out vehicles tailgating. And I wish the police would give that issue as much attention as speeding, at least on motorways. AndyPandy1968\n\nIf [drivers] don’t know where speed cameras are (and there could be one anywhere) they’ll slow down. Currently they speed until they see a highly visible camera. TenaroG\n\nIt is better to drive for the current road conditions, not the speed limit. Speed limit signs encourage drivers to drive at that speed and cannot react to it raining or being icy – or react to rare events, like someone turning right into a seldom used road (I would argue a no-right turn sign would be better than dropping the speed limit to 50 or 40mph).\n\nMost times when you moderately exceed the speed limit, nothing happens; it is unlikely to cause an accident, unless there is a speed trap which causes sudden braking. However, it remains true that the energy of a crash is proportional to the square of the speed. There is more than double the energy crashing at 30mph over 20mph (50% speed increase).\n\nThere is no point driving at 30mph on a housing estate, a half a mile at 30mph takes 1 minute, at 20 takes 1.5 minutes. You just get to the next queue 30 seconds sooner. The average speed in London due to congestion is 7 to 20mph.\n\nOn a dual carriageway, the capacity (vehicles per hour) can be increased by reducing the speed: peak capacity 20mph for cars and 30mph for buses and lorries. Rob333\n\nNo. I see one, I slow down. I mean, ahem, I maintain that safe speed I was already doing, obviously! You could hide them and potentially make more revenue but that grapevine is waaaay bigger than anything Marvin sang about. Word spreads so quickly that people, at least locals, would know all about the secret cameras quicker than Shaw Taylor could say keep ’em peeled. catchytitle\n\nI was once cautioned for signalling to drivers that a speed camera was coming up.\n\nI thought, what’s your problem? Speed cameras are about improving road safety and I’m getting all the cars to slow down. They should have given me a medal and a gold clock, not a caution. Charismata\n\nEh? They are meant to make the roads safer. Which they don’t do if you don’t know they are there. Simply putting up a sign does not make people slow down, we know this from repeat experience. Practically, it would also be daft to hide them as you would need so many signs, eg to notify that cameras are present, then to notify that cameras are not. I’m very suspicious of the mentality that thinks they should be hidden to “catch people out”. It’s the same mentality that insists on prison for non-dangerous offences and, at its most extreme, capital punishment. Both things confer only brutality upon society and the resultant pressure on social and health services while probably not reducing crime. Believers of demonstrably ineffective punitive systems are a true menace, preferring we all suffer under such systems so they can get a sense of “vengeance”. This to me is more sociopathic than many of the criminals and certainly more so than most speeding drivers. Wyrdsister\n\nSpeed cameras are very expensive to install, maintain and operate, which is why they are only placed where deaths have occurred. If visible, then most drivers slow down at them proving that they work as intended, while drivers ignoring them correctly get fined. This is why you see many other physical methods for restricting speeds such as humps, tables, cushions and chicanes. Any road without cameras or physical controls will always see drivers that speed. swely\n\nWith an electric car there is so little feedback that I always use the speed limiter. It doesn’t require many people doing this to bring everybody into line, literally! I’ve worked in the auto industry and had to look at overall safety issues. The statistics are as clear as they are for smoking when it comes to speeding – just don’t do it. Forlornehope\n\nYes to secret cameras to reduce speeding but why stop there? Why not also introduce secret number plate recognition cameras to tackle the industrial-scale dumping of household goods all over our pavements?\n\nBritain’s cities, especially working-class communities, are being turned into public dumps where illegal fly-tipping by the middle-class and small businesses is out of control. If your vehicle is used for illegal public dumping, you should have your driving licence revoked for 12 months and then be forced to resit your driving test. Let’s take back control of our pavements! whitman100\n\nIn reply to whitman100: Most people don’t want to live in the surveillance society you describe. We know it doesn’t stop crime. It simply changes it. Wyrdsister\n\nThey seem to catch enough people anyway in their bright yellow condition. Seems fairer with that much warning. unclestinky\n\nClearly, having signs decreases the speed in any specific camera’s location. However, it also provides tacit permission to speed elsewhere.\n\nI think the obvious solution to this paradox is to require car manufacturers to begin turning off car safety features at 30mph. Start small – passenger airbags turn off at 31mph, driver ones at 50. By the time a car hits 71, an ejector seat should be ready to fire the driver into the ceiling. It would be interesting to learn how many drivers would be willing to risk their own health rather than that of others as they speed “perfectly safely”. Hugh B, by email\n\nThe recent road safety review ignored the elephant in the room, ie speed. Road traffic deaths [in Great Britain] have averaged around 1,600+ for the last several years; if that figure applied to air or rail travel, fleets would be grounded and networks shut down until the matter was investigated. Because road traffic deaths happen in small numbers per incident, they are hardly noticed, often barely making local media, marked only by sad little shrines of flowers by the side of a stretch of road.\n\nSo … my thoughts (not vote winners)\n\n1. Review all speed limits; 20mph where conditions are hazardous, 30 up to 40 on the outskirts of towns/villages (30 can go on too long)\n\n 2. Greater use of 50mph limit; it’s a big jump 40 to 60.\n\n 3. Increase the limit to 80mph on motorways.\n\nOnce that’s done, remove the requirement for cameras to be visible and allow local councils to share unpersoned mobile digital cameras and install far more average speed cameras.\n\nThen, allow some leeway (say 10%) and then prosecute everyone who speeds, increase the fines and the number of points. There will be a huge outcry which will settle down when death numbers start to fall dramatically (which they will!) As I said, not a vote winner but an effective strategy to deal with the current ludicrous situation where people think it’s OK to break the law a little bit. Phillip Tanswell, by email\n\nWhat about a road reflector containing radio-frequency identification (RFID) set to the proper (safe) speed limit? This would communicate with the vehicle passing above. The driver would be alerted and if speed is not adjusted the onboard computer does it for them. Roads are a public place … not your private racetrack. Paul Tobiason, by email",

    "fullText": "Reviewed by Dietitian Karen Ansel, M.S., RDN\n\nNeeding to pee frequently throughout the night can be a hidden sign of some health conditions.\n\nThese include diabetes, sleep apnea, overactive bladder or benign prostate hyperplasia.\n\nIf you routinely wake up to pee more than once a night, speak to your health care provider.\n\nPicture this: You’re fast asleep and in the middle of a great dream, when an uncomfortable feeling jolts you awake. It’s your bladder calling, telling you it’s time to use the bathroom. Of course, waking up to pee at night happens to everyone occasionally. But if it’s happening more than once a night, it could be a sign of an underlying health issue.\n\n“You should be able to sleep about six to eight hours without waking up to go to the bathroom,” says urologist Justin Dubin, M.D. “If you’re waking up two or more times per night, that’s considered abnormal.”\n\nThe medical term for those excessive bathroom breaks is nocturia. While nocturia itself isn’t a disease, it can be a symptom of one. And it’s more common than you might think, affecting 50 million adults in the U.S. Most are over age 65, but even 1 in 3 of those over 30 say they get up to pee two or more times nightly.\n\nShould you be concerned? To find out, we spoke to urologists and a dietitian about conditions that can cause those nighttime bathroom trips, what’s considered normal, plus practical tips to prevent them.\n\nThere are many potential causes of excessive nighttime urination, including lifestyle habits, bladder capacity, some medications and underlying health conditions. Here are four of the most common health issues that might be the culprit.\n\nIf you find yourself waking up to use the bathroom more often than usual, it could be one of the first signs of blood sugar troubles. Frequent urination is one of the early signs of diabetes, says urologist Scott D. Miller, M.D., M.B.A., a diagnosis he makes several times each year.\n\nAn estimated 15% of American adults are living with diabetes, and roughly 3% are unaware of it. When diabetes goes undiagnosed or is poorly managed, elevated blood sugar levels can lead to more frequent visits to the bathroom.\n\nHow does it happen? “Elevated blood glucose levels can trigger osmotic diuresis, resulting in excessive nighttime urination,” says Elizabeth Shaw, M.S., RDN, CPT. This is when the kidneys try to lower blood sugar by pulling excess glucose into the urine, and water follows. “This leads to increased urine production around the clock, including overnight,” adds Miller.\n\n“Many patients are surprised to learn their bladder symptoms are actually sleep-related,” says Miller. One to look out for is sleep apnea. “Sleep apnea occurs when the throat muscles relax during sleep and block breathing, causing people to wake up repeatedly during the night,” says Shaw. Tip-offs that you have it are snoring or gasping for air while you sleep.\n\nSleep apnea can also be a sneaky reason you’re getting up to use the bathroom. Beyond disrupting sleep, sleep apnea can lower oxygen levels in the blood, which triggers hormone changes that encourage nighttime urination production, says Miller. Specifically, it leads to increased secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), a hormone that helps your kidneys excrete water from the body.\n\nIf you find you’re going to the bathroom frequently throughout the day and more than twice per night, you might have an overactive bladder. “Overactive bladder is a condition in which the bladder is oversensitive and sends frequent or sudden signals to urinate, even when it isn’t full, leading to urgency and frequent bathroom trips day or night,” explains Miller. The good news is that there are medications that can help calm your bladder. So, if you are always running to the bathroom, speak with your health care provider.\n\nAs men get older, the prostate gland naturally grows. This condition is called benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). “When the prostate is enlarged, you can’t empty your bladder as well, so your [bladder] may feel more full more frequently, and the time for you to tolerate holding in urination can decrease,” explains Dubin. Fortunately, for many men, lifestyle changes can help (more on this soon!).\n\nFor most adults, up to one nighttime bathroom trip is considered normal. Consistently waking two or more times per night (especially if it’s new, worsening or exhausting) deserves a medical visit, says Miller.\n\n“You should be concerned anytime nocturia disrupts sleep or daytime energy,” he says. “When nocturia occurs suddenly or is associated with urinary pain, excessive thirst, leg swelling or shortness of breath, you should promptly seek medical attention.”\n\nIn addition to working with your health care provider to find out the cause of those nighttime bathroom trips, experts recommend trying these tips.\n\nStop drinking two hours before bed: Cut back on all fluids two hours before bedtime, especially alcoholic and caffeinated drinks, says Dubin. Both alcohol and caffeine are diuretics that can cause you to urinate more frequently.\n\nCheck your medications: Some medications, like diuretics for high blood pressure or heart conditions, can increase urination. For men with BPH, some antihistamines and over-the-counter cold meds can also be triggers. Ask your health care provider whether it’s possible to take these medications in the morning instead of the evening, or if there is an alternate medication that might work for you.\n\nTreat underlying conditions: Untreated sleep apnea and diabetes can worsen sleep and increase urination. “It’s best to get these under control to help peeing at night and sleep better,” says Dubin.\n\nAddress leg swelling: Your legs can swell at night for various reasons. Some can be serious, which is why you should never ignore it. But there are also benign culprits, like standing or sitting too long during the day, taking certain medications, or eating lots of salty foods. Swollen legs can also make you need to pee frequently. “Elevating the legs or wearing compression socks in the evening can help shift fluid earlier, reducing nighttime urine production,” says Miller.\n\nIt’s normal to wake up at night to pee occasionally. But if it happens more than twice a night, it could be your body trying to tell you there’s a problem. “Waking up at night to urinate may not be just a bladder issue, it can be your body’s way of raising a red flag,” says Miller.\n\nConditions like diabetes, sleep apnea, overactive bladder and benign prostate hyperplasia can all make you need to pee frequently throughout the night. While one nightly trip to the bathroom is considered normal, anything more might indicate an underlying issue. So, be sure to let your health care provider know. In addition to treating underlying health conditions, experts recommend cutting back on fluids two hours before bedtime, reviewing your medications with your health care provider and addressing leg swelling. In return, you might cut down on those nightly bathroom trips and finally get the rest you need.",

    "description": "Doctors explain why it's so detrimental.",
    "fullText": "Heart health isn’t likely something that you thought much about in your younger years, but if you’re 60 or older, it’s probably something you’ve started prioritizing. If not, you should start. Risks for cardiovascular disease, heart attack and stroke all increase with age. Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death for adults over 60, making prevention and early intervention more important than ever. While many people assume that heart problems are inevitable with aging, research shows that lifestyle choices can meaningfully influence outcomes, even later in life.\n\nAge is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, which is compounded by other risk factors including genetics, sex, level of fragility and obesity. This is because blood vessels stiffen and narrow over time. The heart muscle also becomes thicker and less efficient. These structural changes can make it harder for the heart to pump blood effectively, increasing blood pressure and strain on the cardiovascular system.\nOver time, this added strain can contribute to fatigue, shortness of breath and reduced exercise tolerance, even during everyday activities.\n\nWhile there’s no way to prevent getting older, your biological age is not necessarily your chronological age. Biological age reflects the state of your cells and tissues and how your body is aging at a cellular level. Depending on your diet and lifestyle habits, your biological age can be either younger or older than your chronological age. \n\nThere’s one common habit that doctors say ages the heart even faster than smoking. Here's what you need to know.\n\nWhen most people think of habits that support heart health, they think of habits like getting regular exercise, eating a nutrient-rich diet and not smoking. While these certainly are all habits that greatly support heart health, there’s one common habit that many people don’t realize ages their heart prematurely: not getting enough sleep.\n\nDr. Beverly J. Fang, MD, a psychiatrist and sleep medicine specialist at the University of Maryland Medical Center and a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry and medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, says that chronic sleep deprivation is linked to a higher risk of high blood pressure, one key way that not getting enough sleep ages the heart. “The risk is higher with even shorter sleep durations of fewer than five hours per night. Some studies suggest this relationship may be particularly pronounced in women,” she explains.\n\n🩺\nWhy does this happen? According to Dr. Fang, when we don’t get enough sleep, the systems that help regulate blood pressure are disrupted. “Sleep restriction increases activation of the sympathetic nervous system—the body’s ‘fight, flight, freeze’ response—which raises heart rate and blood pressure,” she says, adding that, at the same time, not getting enough sleep raises cortisol levels. Together, this can lead to higher blood pressure over time because it prevents the natural dips in blood pressure that happen during sleep.\n\nDr. Jack Wolfson, DO, FACC, a cardiologist and the founder of Natural Heart Doctor, says that another way that lack of sleep raises blood pressure is because endothelial function (jobs performed by the endothelium, which is the thin cell layer lining blood vessels) declines with poor sleep. “Blood vessels lose their ability to produce nitric oxide, making them stiffer and less able to relax. Over time, poor sleep quality and quantity significantly increase the risk of heart attack, stroke and heart failure,” he explains.\n\nBoth doctors say that chronic sleep deprivation causes inflammation, which is also bad for cardiovascular health. Dr. Wolfson tells Parade that even short-term sleep loss raises inflammation, so when it happens for years, the impact is particularly detrimental. He explains that chronic sleep loss damages blood vessels, accelerates plaque formation and increases arterial stiffness.\n\n“It also destabilizes existing plaque, raising the risk of sudden plaque rupture, which is the most common trigger for heart attacks,” he says. On top of all this, he explains that not getting enough sleep also worsens insulin resistance.\n\nAccording to Dr. Fang, not getting enough sleep completely messes up the circadian rhythm, which is the body’s internal clock. This, too, prematurely ages the heart. Dr. Fang explains that when the body’s internal clock is disrupted, it leads to abnormal blood pressure patterns and disrupted metabolic regulation.\n\nAs you can see, there are a whole lot of ways that not getting enough sleep impacts the cardiovascular system. Because of this, Dr. Wolfson says that chronically not getting enough sleep ages the heart even faster than smoking does.\n\n“Smoking is a powerful cardiovascular toxin, but chronic sleep deprivation is a full-body system disruptor. Poor sleep drives constant sympathetic activation, chronic inflammation, hormonal imbalance, metabolic dysfunction, impaired vascular repair and accelerated biological aging—all at once,” he explains.\n\nThere’s another way that not getting enough sleep can negatively impact heart health: It increases the risk of obesity, and obesity is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Both doctors explain that not getting enough sleep alters key appetite-regulating hormones by increasing ghrelin, a hormone produced in the stomach that stimulates hunger, and decreasing leptin, a hormone released by fat cells that signals fullness.\n\nOn top of that, Dr. Fang says that not getting enough sleep can also affect the brain’s endocannabinoid system, which can then increase cravings for calorie-dense foods high in carbohydrates and fats. “In addition, sleep deprivation is associated with reduced insulin sensitivity and impaired blood glucose regulation, raising the risk of developing diabetes or worsening diabetes control,” she says.\n\nWhen you’re tired, Dr. Wolfson points out that it’s also harder to have the motivation and energy to be active, another way in which lack of sleep can increase the risk of obesity.\n\nBecause of all of the ways not getting enough sleep impacts heart health, consistently getting enough sleep is vital. To best support your circadian rhythm (and in turn, your cardiovascular system), Dr. Wolfson says to go to bed after it gets dark and rise with the sun. He adds that not using tech at night and getting sunshine during the day also supports circadian rhythm.\n\nThe importance of getting enough sleep can’t be overemphasized. If you have trouble sleeping, make it your goal to get to the root issue of your sleep problems this year. Your heart depends on it!\n\nHeart disease remains leading cause of death as key health risk factors continue to rise. American Heart Association.\n\nNoto, S. (2023).

A mining company has found an estimated 77 billion-ton phosphate deposit, enough to satisfy the global demand for the next 50 years, according to its discoverers.\n\nThe deposit was discovered by Norge Mining back in 2018, but it wasn't until this May that the company announced just how much phosphate it had discovered.\n\n\"Down to 400 meters, we established two world-class resources, which together allow a supply of raw materials for at least 50 years,\" Michael Wurmser, Norge Mining's founder and deputy CEO, told Euractiv.\n\nPhosphate, when processed into phosphoric acid, is a key ingredient in lithium iron phosphate batteries. These batteries are what keep many solar energy systems and electric vehicles running.\n\nIn fact, lithium iron phosphate batteries are soon expected to boom in usage. According to the International Energy Agency, by 2040, the market share of lithium iron phosphate batteries in commercial vehicles is expected to increase to 90%.\n\nAs demand for clean energy systems soars, this discovery isn't just important for its size — but also for its location. Before the discovery of this deposit, key producers of phosphate were Morocco, China, the U.S., and Russia. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the market has been massively disrupted.\n\nThe discovery of this deposit is expected to help alleviate some of that strain, which means EVs and solar panels could see a decrease in their costs.\n\n\"When you find something of that magnitude in Europe, which is larger than all the other sources we know — it is significant,\" Wurmser said. \"We believe the phosphorous that we can produce will be important to the West — it provides autonomy.\"\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the coolest innovations improving our lives and saving our planet.",

    "fullText": "BEIRUT (AP) — Robina Aminian's family believes the college student was killed by a bullet fired by Iranian security forces straight into the back of her head.\n\nBut her death in the nationwide protests that challenged the Islamic Republic's theocracy was only the start of the family's agony. In the aftermath of the killing, Aminian's mother had to look through piles of bloodied corpses to find her daughter's body. Then the family raced to escape authorities who might demand payment to release the body and buried her hastily in an unmarked roadside pit.\n\nTheir odyssey reflects the trail of anguish left by Iran's deadly assault on protesters, which has led to desperate relatives searching overflowing morgues across the country. For families, the loss of loved ones is compounded by the difficulty they face in grieving and giving the dead a dignified sendoff.\n\nMore than a week after she was killed, Aminian's relatives say they still have not held a funeral for the young Kurdish woman who was studying fashion in Tehran, the capital.\n\n“She wanted a bright future for herself,” her uncle, Nezar Minoei, said from Oslo. “But unfortunately, the future has been stolen from her.”\n\nDetails about what happened to Aminian are scant. After her death, her mother called relatives outside the country, recounting what she learned from Aminian's friends, who were present when she was killed.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke to three relatives, who all described similar details from the mother's account. An Oslo-based human rights organization, Iran Human Rights, released a report about her killing, citing witness testimony. They verified there was a shooting on the night of Jan. 8 around the campus of the Shariati Technical and Vocational College for Girls.\n\nWith communications greatly limited in Iran, the AP has been unable to independently confirm the family’s account or the wounds to Aminian’s body or to verify its location. The Iranian mission to the United Nations in New York has declined to comment.\n\nThe U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which relies on a network of activists on the ground and has been accurate during previous unrest in Iran, said at least 3,090 people have been killed. Iran's government has not offered any overall casualties figures.\n\nEverything that Aminian's relatives abroad know about her death comes from a brief phone call her mother was able to make Jan. 10 to relatives in Oslo.\n\nThey say the mother, Amina Norei, got a call Jan. 8 from Aminian’s friends, who said she had been gunned down by security forces. The friends told Norei they were walking away from campus in Tehran after dark when they saw a protest and joined in.\n\nA bullet fired by security forces struck the back of Aminian’s head, her friends told the mother.\n\nVideos shared on social media, verified by the AP, and statements by rights groups, doctors and survivors, describe Iranian agents using rifles and shotguns to disperse protesters across the country.\n\nIran's theocracy, which has used violence in previous rounds of unrest, increasingly refers to demonstrators as “terrorists.\" Authorities allege some demonstrators were armed, but there are no allegations that anyone was armed in Aminian's vicinity at the time of her death.\n\nAminian’s relatives said she was not an activist or involved in politics.\n\nAminian's mother was in Kermanshah, a western city in the Kurdish region of Iran nearly 460 kilometers (230 miles) from Tehran, when she learned about her daughter's death.\n\nShe rushed to Tehran in the middle of the night, she told family. Norei recalled to them how she began unzipping body bag after body bag, looking for Aminian.\n\n“She looked through so many beautiful faces, trying to find her girl,\" Hali Norei, Amnian's aunt, said from Oslo. ”And what is so horrifying for me is imagining what my sister feels as she searches for her daughter.\"\n\nMany other Iranian families are searching overflowing morgues for loved ones, according to rights group Amnesty International. Bodies have piled up in trucks, freight containers and warehouses, the group said.\n\nWhen Norei found her daughter, she was joined by her husband, daughter and son, and the family rushed out with the body, fearing authorities would block their way and insist on a payment to release the corpse, according to Minoei, Aminian’s uncle.\n\n“She actually stole the body,” Minoei said.\n\nIn a statement to the AP, the New York City-based Center for Human Rights in Iran said it has received multiple accounts of intelligence forces demanding money from families in exchange for the return of protesters' bodies. The group called the levies “a well-known, standard practice” in Iran to scare families into not publicly mourning their dead.\n\nOther families reported to the center that they were forced to sign papers falsely declaring that their dead relatives were members of the security forces in order to retrieve the bodies.\n\nIranian state television recently aired a statement saying mortuary and burial services were free, after repeated allegations of the practice.\n\nMinoei said the mother told him that she and her oldest daughter spent the seven-hour ride back to Kermanshah clutching the body in the backseat, blood and tears staining their clothes. When they got home, the mother told him, security forces had surrounded their house.\n\nAmina Norei told her family they had only one option: They drove out of town and dug a pit on the side of the road. They placed the body inside and drove away. Aminian is still believed to be buried there, in an unmarked grave.\n\nRelatives said they have not heard from Amina Norei or other relatives in Iran since Sunday.\n\nJulia Frankel reported from Jerusalem.",

    "description": "Top 10: Submarine-Destroying Aircraft of All Time",
    "fullText": "Submarines mauled shipping and threatened the survival of many nations in the second world war.\n\nOne way to fight back was with anti-submarine warfare aircraft. Attacking a submarine from the air was a dangerous game, as surfaced submarines fired back at their attackers with machine guns and cannon. Converted bombers would roar a few hundred feet above the sea dropping depth charges and firing rockets; with over 120 Allied aircraft shot down while attacking submarines this was in no way a one-sided affair. Intriguingly, despite significant advances in technology the only submarine sinking post-World War Two was distinctly ‘old fashioned’.\n\nThis list is skewed towards Allied aircraft, as the German Navy (the Kreigsmarine), managed to lose 287 U-Boats to aircraft, more than the total number of submarines lost by the Britain’s Royal Navy, US Navy, and Imperial Japanese Navy combined. The following aircraft are the most potent submarine killers of all time:\n\nOnly one submarine has been sunk by aircraft since the end of the second world war. This unfortunate vessel was the ARA Santa Fe, whose origin as the USS Catfish in 1944 means no post-war submarine has been sunk by enemy action. On the morning of 25 April 1982, Santa Fe was departing Grytviken in South Georgia, having landed supplies for the Argentinian forces occupying the island. She was detected on radar by the Westland Wessex HAS3 from HMS Antrim before she was in an area where she could submerge.\n\nApproaching from the stern the Wessex was almost overhead before the crew saw it, moments later two depth charges fell towards the submarine. The damage from this first strike prevented the Santa Fe diving, if only because she would never surface again if she did.\n\nA running battle now ensued as the Argentinians attempted to return to Grytviken while HMS Brilliant’s Westland Lynx (pictured) strafed the submarine and Westland Wasps from HMS Endurance and Plymouth fired multiple AS.12 missiles. Although Santa Fe managed to return to the dock her war was over, and she remained there until scuttled in 1985.\n\nThis halved the number of submarines available to the Argentinian forces attempting to hold the Falklands Islands. This left the depths of the south Atlantic open to much more modern British submarines - six of them - one of which sank the Argentinian cruiser General Belgrano – another former US Navy vessel, which had survived the Pearl Harbour attack – a week later.\n\nAlthough now two land-locked countries, in 1914 the Austro-Hungarian Empire had an extensive Adriatic coast. As such they had a substantial navy with 13 battleships, 18 destroyers, 6 submarines, and an Air Service.\n\nOn 15 September 1916 the French Navy submarine Foucault was patrolling near the entrance to the naval base at Cattaro, now Kotor in Montenegro. Two Lohner L flying boats of the Austro-Hungarian Naval Air Service were also in the area and although the Foucault was submerged the clear waters of the Adriatic allowed the crews to easily spot her.\n\nAlthough relatively flimsy and with a top speed of only 66mph the Lohners could carry a few hundred kilograms of bombs. Four of these were dropped at least one hitting the submarine causing it to lose power and start sinking. With a fire adding to their woes the French somehow managed to get to the surface. Facing an untenable situation the ship’s commander ordered the powerless submarine scuttled. The crew were then rescued by their attackers who landed on the water to look after them until a torpedo boat could come to take them into captivity.\n\nAlmost definitely the slowest aircraft on this list the Lohner L has the distinction of proving aircraft could have a part to play in sinking submarines.\n\nAlthough a relatively obscure type the Potez-CAMS 141 has the highest ratio of submarines sunk per airframes built of all time. Admittedly this is because only one of them was built, but it did at least manage to sink U-105 on 2 June 1943. The Potez-CAMS 141, also known as the Antarès, was designed and built to a 1935 French Admiralty specification for a long-range maritime reconnaissance flying boat. The prototype flew in 1938 with orders for an additional 19 airframes being placed by September 1939, however, with the fall of France in 1940 these were never built.\n\nThe sole example led a somewhat nomadic existence initially operating out of Morocco, by September 1940 it was patrolling from Senegal as part of the Vichy French forces. With the Allied landings in North Africa in late 1942 the Antares again changed sides, paving the way for its successful prosecution of the U-105 just south of Dakar seven months later.\n\nAlas being from a production batch of one and with few spares available by the beginning of 1944 she was nearing the end of her operational life, having flown around 1800 hours. Disappointingly the airframe appears to have been scrapped in Africa meaning there are few if any remains of what by at least one measure was the most successful anti-submarine aircraft of all time.\n\nThe Curtiss H-12 was a modified version of a US flying boat with Rolls-Royce Eagle engines and was one of the Royal Navy’s first anti-submarine aircraft. On 27 May 1917 an H-12 operating from the Isles of Scilly sighted UC-66 on the surface to the north of the archipelago. The pilot dropped the payload of 50kg bombs two of which seemed to have hit the U-Boat as it soon sank by the stern not to be seen again until 2009.\n\nHit by machine gun fire from the sinking U-boat the aircraft then flew back to its base on Tresco with the Mechanic holding rags over a bullet hole in the starboard radiator.\n\nAt the other end of the English Channel on 22 Sep 1917 another H-12, escorted by two Sopwith Camel fighters, attacked a surfaced submarine in the vicinity of West Hinder Light Vessel, about 20 miles off Ostend. After also being hit by two bombs it heeled over and sank, leaving wreckage and oil on the surface, it’s now thought the stricken submarine was UB-32.\n\nOn top of probably being responsible for 66% of submarines sunk by aircraft in the First World War, Curtiss H-12s also shot down several Zeppelins. Which, given its top speed of 100mph, must have made for some of the slowest dogfights in history.\n\nAlthough the Grumman Wildcat doesn’t appear to be solely responsible for the sinking of any submarines it was involved in the destruction of 27 of them. It kicked this streak off while operating with 802 NAS from HMS Audacity, aircraft on patrol spotting U-131 on the surface near Madeira. The Wildcats carried out strafing runs while a group of destroyers and sloops closed to finish it off with gunfire and depth charges.\n\nMore typically they were paired with either a Swordfish or Avenger. The vast majority of the Wildcat’s assisted kills being while operating from the decks of a US Navy escort carrier alongside its Grumman stable mate.\n\nThe fighter carried out strafing runs while the Avenger was positioned for a depth charge or torpedo attack. The torpedoes in question were code-named Fido and were the first homing torpedoes seeking out the noise from the submarine’s propellers. Although a technical marvel it suffered from having a top speed of 17 mph, slightly slower than the surface-speed of most U-boats.\n\nThe continual harassment from the Wildcat playing no small part in slowing them down or causing them to dive at which point they struggled to make 9mph and became easy prey for Fido.\n\nThe main aim of anti-submarine warfare isn’t necessarily sinking submarines - it’s generally to stop the submarine sinking your ships. This is especially true if your ships are carrying supplies that are keeping the country alive. So, during the Battle of the Atlantic escorts that managed to sink five U-boats while their convoy was decimated could be viewed less favourably than ones who managed to bring their charges across without loss to either side.\n\nWith this in mind, Fairey’s most famous contribution to the art of naval warfare deserves a special place on this list.\n\nIn total, the Swordfish is credited with 25 submarine kills, which places it 9th on numbers alone. However, its ability to operate from escort carriers and the even smaller flight decks on Merchant Aircraft Carriers (MACs) enabled them to provide a continuous aerial escort across the Atlantic.  MACs were as the name suggests merchant ships with a wooden flight deck a modest 410 feet by 62 feet, they had a limited top speed of around 14mph, and carried at most four Swordfish.\n\nDespite this limited capability their presence forced the opposition underwater preventing them closing on the convoy. Perhaps this explains why that in the 207 convoys escorted by Swordfish operating MACs, only nine ships were lost to U-boats despite none having been sunk by the embarked aircraft.\n\nA number of flying boats were used during the Second World War, for ASW the best of these was undoubtedly the Consolidated Catalina. Able to carry out a two-hour patrol 800 miles from base it could take the fight far out into the Atlantic. Despite only having half the engines of the Sunderland the Catalina could carry almost the same weapons load and had the advantage of also being able to use torpedoes, something it deployed in anger around Guadalcanal.\n\nThe first submarine sunk by a Catalina was U-452 which was attacked south of Iceland by the trawler HMS Vascama and an aircraft of the RAF’s 209 squadron in August 1941. In a twist of fate, the next U-boat sunk by a Catalina was in a similar location a year later by a US Navy aircraft.\n\nAs patrol aircraft, Catalinas were also responsible for sighting the German battleship Bismarck prior to her final battle, Japanese landings in Malaya, and the Japanese fleet prior to the battles of Ceylon and Midway.\n\nIn terms of anti-submarine activity, the Catalina sank a total of 40 submarines, 14 more than the Sunderland and equal second overall with the Avenger. It also had the first air-to-air victory by a US Navy aircraft in the Second World War, the bow gunner of an aircraft evacuating from the Philippines shooting down a Mitsubishi Zero on 10 December 1941.\n\nWhat about the Short Sunderland?\n\nThe Sunderland was indeed excellent. From our notes the Sunderland had 26 kills to the Catalina's 40. The Sunderland likely has more kills per aircraft (because of the much smaller production run). It was really 50/50 which aircraft from this class we included, with the Catalina edging it.\n\nFor anti-submarine warfare, the best of these was undoubtedly the Consolidated Catalina. Able to carry out a two-hour patrol at 800 miles from base, two hundred more than the Short Sunderland, taking the fight far out into the Atlantic. Despite only having half the engines of the Sunderland, the Catalina could carry almost the same weapons load and had the advantage of also being able to use torpedoes, something it used in anger against Japanese shipping around Guadalcanal.\n\nWhat about the Short Sunderland?\n\nThe Sunderland was indeed excellent.

As well as the ASV II radar that some Mk1s had used for detecting surfaced submarines the latter also featured the Leigh Light, a powerful spotlight, and a radar altimeter to allow safe descent over the sea at night.\n\nAfter detecting a U-Boat using radar the Wellington would descend to 250 feet, as the contact disappeared off the bottom of the radar display the Leigh Light would be turned on illuminating the target and allowing the attack to be completed visually. Four U-boats were damaged in June, while July would see the first U-boat sunk by a Wellington.\n\nFrom sinking no submarines in the first half of 1942 Coastal Command found itself responsible for 13 and a half in the period from August to December. At a time when RAF chief Arthur Harris was telling Churchill that Coastal Command was ‘merely an obstacle to victory’ this was fortunate indeed.\n\nAlthough the Wellington couldn’t protect convoys in the mid-Atlantic gap, generally managing only around five hundred miles from base, it made the waters around the U-boats’ French bases far more dangerous and pioneered tactics that would be used by Coastal Command to turn the tide in the Battle of the Atlantic.\n\nWhile the Swordfish was a good carrier borne ASW aircraft it suffered in a few areas, mainly speed, crew comfort, and ruggedness. If you really wanted to kill submarines while operating off a ship the Grumman Avenger suffered none of these issues. The extra speed allowed it to search a greater area in a given time and meant that during an attack it would be exposed to the U-boats gunfire for a shorter period.\n\nAdditionally, it allowed other Avengers to make follow up attacks as they were able to get to the scene of the action before the submarine could make its escape. U-boats generally being sunk due to a continued attack rather than a single killer blow. U-118 for instance was attacked with depth charges from eight Avengers before submerging for the final time.\n\nThe Avenger also suffered far less damage during carrier operations. Analysis by the Royal Navy not only showed the American aircraft suffered 1/7th the rate of damage the Swordfish did, but that the lower risk of damage meant carriers were more likely to fly them. Having done the analysis, the Fleet Air Arm prioritised its Avengers for anti-submarine warfare.\n\nThese advantages place the Avenger at number two on the all-time list of submarine killing aircraft, with 35 U-boats and at least 5 Japanese submarines falling to it.\n\nDuring the second world war, 25% of the 287 U-Boats lost by the German navy to aircraft, were sunk by the Liberator. RAF Coastal Command first received 20 ex-USAAF B-24As in 1941, and these then gained a radar, four 20mm cannon, and the ability to carry depth charges and rockets. This was followed by the Consolidated Liberator GR Mk III, essentially a modified B-24D. The self-sealing liners to the fuel tanks and most of the armour were removed.\n\nThe turbo-superchargers for the engines to maintain performance at high altitude were deleted. The ventral gun turret also went eventually providing a location for a more advanced radar. This allowed over two thousand gallons of fuel and a payload of eight depth charges to be carried.\n\nAs an example of what these changes allowed on 17 March 1943 a Liberator of 86 Squadron left Aldergrove for a nine-hour flight to join convoy SC122. On the way, it attacked U-439 causing it to remain submerged for the rest of the day. On reaching SC122 the aircraft swept the convoy’s route, and attacked U-338, forcing it too to submerge.\n\nFinally, the aircraft turned back towards home. It finally landed, dangerously short of fuel, having been in the air for 20 hours and 30 minutes. The Liberator had impressive endurance, was well armed, and, importantly, had the size and power to accommodate new sensors and weapons as they became available; it remains the most successful anti-submarine aircraft of all time.\n\nIf you enjoyed this story, please click the Follow button above to see more like it from Autocar",

    "fullText": "In an AI market full of spectacle and hype, Samsung says it's trying to blend in.\n\nSimon Sung, the CEO of Samsung Electronics Europe, told Business Insider that its AI strategy is \"about AI that is genuinely useful and unobtrusive,\" whether that's a smart home responding autonomously or appliances coordinating daily routines in the background.\n\n\"The focus is firmly on everyday value rather than novelty,\" he said in an interview over email.\n\nSamsung has developed its own large language models, called Samsung Gauss, but does not offer them directly as a stand-alone consumer product like OpenAI does with ChatGPT.\n\nInstead, its consumer-facing efforts center on the Galaxy AI assistant, which is built into the company's smartphones and uses a mix of its in-house AI and tech developed by partners such as Google. Like Google's assistant on its Pixel smartphones, Galaxy AI can perform tasks like live translation and transcription.\n\n\"The shift is from AI as a feature you turn on to AI as a companion that works alongside you,\" said Sung.\n\nWithin the South Korean conglomerate, Samsung Electronics is the company responsible for consumer technology, including its Galaxy smartphones, TVs, and home appliances. It's also a producer of memory chips used in PCs and data centers. In earnings guidance shared earlier this month, the company said it expects profits to triple in the final quarter of 2025 amid a surge in demand for memory chips to power AI models.\n\nIn early January, Samsung showcased TVs, kitchen appliances, and washing machines at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas that featured sensors and voice recognition.\n\n\"The goal is to make technology feel less like a collection of gadgets, and more like a coherent, responsive environment that adapts to real life,\" Sung said.\n\nInternally, Sung said Samsung Electronics provides training and encourages information exchanges between product, design, engineering, and marketing teams \"so that AI fluency grows across the organization rather than within isolated groups.\"\n\n\"Because we're building AI into TVs, appliances, mobile devices, and connected services simultaneously, employees naturally think about intelligence as a shared layer across the entire experience, not as a stand-alone feature,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "My wife and I met nearly two decades ago in the same newsroom. We were cub reporters, then friends, and then started dating. Eventually, we got married. Now we have two kids.\n\nI'd say it's a sweet story — and an increasingly antiquated one.\n\nDating in 2026 looks quite different. Dating apps have gone from taboo to mainstream to played out. Now, a white-collar job apocalypse and a cutthroat AI arms race have people working harder than ever, and that's put dating on the back burner for plenty of folks.\n\nMy colleague Henry Chandonnet reports on a new phenomenon taking hold in Silicon Valley. He says tech's dating scene, which was never particularly hot, has frozen over.\n\nHenry spoke with more than two dozen young tech professionals in the Bay Area who described a dating culture shaped by anxiety and exhaustion. There's a large cohort who have sworn off dating entirely, with many \"locked in\" on building their careers.\n\nIt all shows how the rules of romance are changing.\n\nTake LinkedIn. What appears to be a strictly career-focused platform has quietly morphed into a shadow dating app. In the age of remote work, users are sending banal LinkedIn requests under the guise of networking. In reality, they're screening potential love interests.\n\nMeanwhile, traditional dating apps are turning to AI to bring back lapsed users. Tinder, Hinge, and Bumble are pouring millions into generative AI matchmaking tools that promise fewer swipes and deeper connections. A new crop of AI-first dating startups is making the same promise: Let the bots do the work of sifting through people and finding your perfect match. AI wingmen are a thing now.\n\nThere's stuff IRL, too. Partiful, the social event invite app, recently launched \"Crush,\" a feature that lets users discreetly signal interest in people they've met at real-world events.\n\nIf the crush is mutual, you'll get a notification affirming that the person \"has a crush on you too!\" Think Tinder without the swiping — dating layered onto genuine social overlap.\n\nWe're optimizing everything these days, dating included. But at the end of the day, maybe we all just want to ditch the algorithms and find connections that feel human again.\n\nOr maybe we're all destined for AI spouses instead.\n\nWhat do you think of the dating landscape?

    "description": "Earth and its neighbors orbit the sun on a relatively flat plane. But what's below this plane, and is anythign below the Earth?",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nIf you've seen illustrations or models of the solar system, maybe you noticed that all the planets orbit the Sun in more or less the same plane, traveling in the same direction.\n\nBut what is above and below that plane? And why are the planets' orbits aligned like this, in a flat pancake, rather than each one traveling in a completely different plane?\n\nI'm a planetary scientist who works with robotic spacecraft, such as rovers and orbiters. When my colleagues and I send them out to explore our solar system, it's important for us to understand the 3D map of our space neighborhood.\n\nEarth's gravity has a lot to do with what people think is up and what is down. Things fall down toward the ground, but that direction depends on where you are.\n\nImagine you're standing somewhere in North America and point downward. If you extend a line from your fingertip all the way through the Earth, that line would point in the direction of \"up\" to someone on a boat in the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nIn the bigger picture, \"down\" could be defined as being below the plane of the solar system, which is known as the ecliptic. By convention, we say that above the plane is where the planets are seen to orbit counterclockwise around the Sun, and from below they are seen to orbit clockwise.\n\nIs there anything special about the direction of down relative to the ecliptic? To answer that, we need to zoom out even farther. Our solar system is centered on the Sun, which is just one of about 100 billion stars in our galaxy, the Milky Way.\n\nEach of these stars, and their associated planets, are all orbiting around the center of the Milky Way, just like the planets orbit their stars, but on a much longer time scale. And just as the planets in our solar system are not in random orbits, stars in the Milky Way orbit the center of the galaxy close to a plane, which is called the galactic plane.\n\nThis plane is not oriented the same way as our solar system's ecliptic. In fact, the angle between the two planes is about 60 degrees.\n\nGoing another step back, the Milky Way is part of a cluster of galaxies known the the Local Group, and — you can see where this is going — these galaxies mostly fall within another plane, called the supergalactic plane. The supergalactic plane is almost perpendicular to the galactic plane, with an angle between the two planes of about 84.5 degrees.\n\nHow these bodies end up traveling paths that are close to the same plane has to do with how they formed in the first place.\n\nThe material that would ultimately compose the Sun and the planets of the solar system started out as a diffuse and very extensive cloud of gas and dust called the solar nebula. Every particle within the solar nebula had a tiny amount of mass. Because any mass exerts gravitational force, these particles were attracted to each other, though only very weakly.\n\nThe particles in the solar nebula started out moving very slowly. But over a long time, the mutual attraction these particles felt thanks to gravity caused the cloud to start to draw inward on itself, shrinking.\n\nThere would have also been some very slight overall rotation to the solar nebula, maybe thanks to the gravitational tug of a passing star. As the cloud collapsed, this rotation would have increased in speed, just like a spinning figure skater spins faster and faster as they draw their arms in toward their body.\n\nAs the cloud continued shrinking, the individual particles grew closer to each other and had more and more interactions affecting their motion, both because of gravity and collisions between them. These interactions caused individual particles in orbits that were tilted far from the direction of the overall rotation of the cloud to reorient their orbits.\n\nFor example, if a particle coming down through the orbital plane slammed into a particle coming up through that plane, the interaction would tend to cancel out that vertical motion and reorient their orbits into the plane.\n\nEventually, what was once an amorphous cloud of particles collapsed into a disc shape. Then particles in similar orbits started clumping together, eventually forming the Sun and all the planets that orbit it today.\n\nOn much bigger scales, similar sorts of interactions are probably what ended up confining most of the stars that make up the Milky Way into the galactic plane, and most of the galaxies that make up the Local Group into the supergalactic plane.\n\nThe orientations of the ecliptic, galactic and supergalactic planes all go back to the initial random rotation direction of the clouds they formed from.\n\nSo there's not really anything special about the direction we define as \"down\" relative to the Earth, other than the fact that there's not much orbiting the Sun in that direction.\n\nIf you go far enough in that direction, you'll eventually find other stars with their own planetary systems orbiting in completely different orientations. And if you go even farther, you might encounter other galaxies with their own planes of rotation.\n\nThis question highlights one of my favorite aspects of astronomy: It puts everything in perspective. If you asked a hundred people on your street, \"Which way is down?\" every one of them would point in the same direction. But imagine you asked that question of people all over the Earth, or of intelligent life forms in other planetary systems or even other galaxies. They'd all point in different directions.\n\nThis edited article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.",

A possible US ban on TikTok, the popular social media app, imperiled ByteDance, one of the country's biggest tech companies. American companies seemed to have surged ahead of Chinese rivals in artificial intelligence development.\n\nTwelve months later, and many of the biggest fears appear to be overblown. The Chinese government has focused on stimulating the economy, leading public companies to significantly increase their buybacks. ByteDance sold a majority stake in its US TikTok operations and is now more valuable than ever, with HSG, the venture capital firm formerly known as Sequoia China, valuing the company at between $350 billion and $370 billion recently. And China's AI scene, led by startup DeepSeek, is keeping pace with Western peers, and Nvidia will be permitted to sell its powerful H200 chips to Chinese companies, the US government said Tuesday.\n\nHedge funds willing to invest in the country last year were rewarded. Bridgewater, which manages $92 billion across all its strategies, generated a 34.2% return in its China Total Returns fund, a person close to the manager told Business Insider. Tekne Capital, managed by Beeneet Kothari, a onetime lieutenant of billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller, was up more than 50% last year, a person close to the manager said.\n\nKothari's $1.5 billion firm is an investor in Chinese companies such as DiDi Global, recruiting firm Kanzhun, and data-center builder GDS, the person said. Kothari told Business Insider in an interview last year that the headwinds facing the country made strong companies very cheap.\n\nAccording to HSBC's Hedge Weekly report, funds based in China and investing in the country performed well. $3.4 billion Pinpoint's China-focused strategy returned more than 24%, while its multistrategy offering, which invests across Asia, was up 11.6%. George Jiang's long-running Golden China fund made close to 33%, and Epimelis Capital, run by Hutchin Hill and Goldman Sachs veteran Fei Sun, made 35% in its China-centric strategy.\n\nThe average China-focused fund was up close to 18%, according to Hedge Fund Research, outpacing the industry average of 10.7%.\n\nGoing into 2026, investors will be watching how the volatile relationship between the US and China evolves, especially around trade agreements connected to chips, as well as any indication that China might invade Taiwan.\n\nByteDance will also be a focus for funds — Tiger Global and Coatue are both backers — as the social media giant continues to grow.",

    "description": "I was sometimes worried about my kids' safety as an urban mom, but Chicago gave my children access to parks, museums, and learning opportunities.",
    "fullText": "While raising my kids in Chicago, I saw a recurring pattern. A neighbor would welcome a second child, or a friend's oldest would be ready for middle school. Suddenly, the city wasn't \"enough\" for them anymore.\n\nSeemingly overnight, they longed for larger backyards, quieter streets, and \"better schools.\" Houses were listed, minivans were purchased, and then loaded to the brim. Those families disappeared into suburban cul-de-sacs.\n\nI, on the other hand, made a different choice. I stayed in Chicago, raising my son and daughter in the heart of the city.\n\nIt wasn't always easy, but it made me a stronger parent, and I hope it made my kids stronger people.\n\nI'll always be concerned about my kids' safety, but in the city, being a helicopter parent is nearly impossible. That turned out to be a good thing.\n\nThe thought of my kids riding buses and trains by themselves made me nervous — at first. Don't even get me started on the gray hairs I earned as they ventured out onto the chaotic city streets on scooters and bicycles in their teen years.\n\nRaising confident, independent kids was so important to me that I had no choice but to foster their independence rather than limit it.\n\nThe end result is that my kids became street-savvy, learning early to read transit maps, manage schedules, and stay alert in public spaces — skills that will serve them for the rest of their lives.\n\nWhen you live in a big city, learning happens everywhere.\n\nMy kids have taken classes at the Art Institute, sketching among masterpieces; they've wandered the Museum of Science and Industry on so many snowy, cold days that they practically know it by heart. When we couldn't go on vacation, we'd \"travel\" to the Garfield Park Conservatory and spend an afternoon learning about ferns and cacti.\n\nThese weren't rare excursions but rather as accessible as a trip to the park.\n\nYes, our backyard is smaller than those in the suburbs, but who needs a sprawling lawn surrounded by a high fence when we have so many incredible city parks to enjoy? Lake Michigan feels like our very own swimming pool to boot.\n\nMy kids grew up playing soccer at the playground of our public school, shooting basketballs into the hoop I installed in our alley (unofficial Chicago kid play zone), ice skating along the Maggie Daley Park loop, or diving into the waves that lap on the shoreline of Foster Avenue Beach, our favorite beach along Chicago's miles of shoreline.\n\nMy kids got a great childhood — even without a lawn or cul-de-sac.\n\nBoth of my kids hold dual citizenship, and much of our extended family lives overseas. If you visit our Chicago home, you're likely to hear another language or two. Cultural richness, both inside our home and out and about in the city, has given my kids an extra dose of empathy and open-mindedness.\n\nIn our city neighborhood, diversity is our neighbor who shared poblano peppers from her garden in the summertime and made sure my kids spoke Spanish outside their high school classroom. Diversity is the classmate who visited our home during Ramadan, gently explaining to my children why they weren't eating snacks.\n\nThere, of course, could be some diversity in the suburbs, but there's nothing like urban life, where so many cultures mix.\n\nI love having my own life in the city, where I can walk to cozy coffee shops, attend concerts on a whim, or catch a quick rideshare to shop in a new-to-me neighborhood.\n\nSuburban life always felt stifling to me. Instead, the city has always managed to keep me engaged, inspired, and connected, even when I was balancing the more mundane aspects of momdom, like nap times, toddler tantrums, and teen angst.\n\nFor this mom, Chicago has always been a place to grow, to learn, and to love.\n\nI paid my dues as a city mom, dealing with the daily unpredictability and, yes, at times, nail-biting worry that comes with raising kids in an urban neighborhood.\n\nI've lived the grit, the joy, and the chaos of true Chicago parenting, and I wouldn't trade those stripes for anything.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump’s made the stunning move, late Saturday, to snub GOP Senator Bill Cassidy (LA) and instead back his would-be primary opponent.\n\nIn a Saturday night Truth Social post, the president announced his support for Rep. Julia Letlow (R-LA) to take on Cassidy in the primary.\n\n“Highly Respected America First Congresswoman, Julia Letlow, of the wonderful State of Louisiana, is a Great Star, has been from the very beginning, and only gets better!” Trump wrote. “I am hearing that Julia is considering launching her Campaign for the United States Senate in Louisiana, a place I love and WON BIG, six times, including Primaries, in 2016, 2020, and 2024!”\n\nHe added, “Should she decide to enter this Race, Julia Letlow has my Complete and Total Endorsement. RUN, JULIA, RUN!!!”\n\nCassidy has bent over backwards to try to get back in Trump’s good graces since voting to convict him in his second impeachment trial in 2021. Most notably, the senator — who is a licensed physician — cast the crucial vote to advance the nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Health and Human Services secretary. Since then, Cassidy has criticized Kennedy’s stance on vaccines on numerous occasions\n\nIn response to Trump’s snub, Cassidy posted on X, “I’m proudly running for re-election as a principled conservative who gets things done for the people of Louisiana. If Congresswoman Letlow decides to run I am confident I will win.”\n\nI'm proudly running for re-election as a principled conservative who gets things done for the people of Louisiana. If Congresswoman Letlow decides to run I am confident I will win.\n\n— Bill Cassidy, M.D. (@BillCassidy) January 18, 2026\n\nThe move is likely to complicate the GOP’s slender 53-47 majority in the Senate. Already, outgoing Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) have proven to be tough votes for Republican Senate leadership to secure on various measures. The New York Times reported that Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) pushed Trump to consider the potential ramifications on future votes by opposing Cassidy, but to no avail.\n\nThe post Trump Spurns GOP Senator — Gives ‘Complete and Total Endorsement’ to His Likely Primary Foe in Shocking Move first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "After selling my longtime home at nearly 70, I paid off debt, traveled the world, and rediscovered confidence and creativity.",
    "fullText": "At almost 70, with my son grown and building his own creative life, I realized the home I had poured myself into for two decades no longer supported the future I wanted.\n\nFor almost 20 years, that house looked like the picture of stability. Teal doors, a tire swing, and a sunny studio beside the garage. It was where I raised my son as a single mother and built my photography career. Most people assumed I would stay there forever.\n\nBut when my son graduated and moved to Orlando, something shifted. I had spent years encouraging him to live the life he wanted. Suddenly, I realized I needed to do the same.\n\nBehind the postcard charm, a truth emerged. The house no longer supported my future. What once felt like a comfortable sanctuary had become a moneypit, its growing debt reminding me daily that I could not afford the life or the freedom I wanted. I had built a home to raise a confident and independent child, and I had done that, but holding on to the house was keeping me from evolving into the next chapter of my life, a chapter filled with creative possibilities that debt made impossible to pursue.\n\nSorting through the rooms, I noticed how little the objects mattered. It was never the things, only the memories. And memories do not require storage space. I photographed what mattered, donated most of the rest, and watched the remnants of my old life line the curb. Letting go gave me breathing room for the first time in years. I could imagine what came next.\n\nSelling the house gave me the financial and emotional space to address something I had avoided for years. I needed extensive dental work, and with missing teeth, I no longer felt confident in my own smile. As a photographer, I had spent decades coaxing others to relax while I avoided the lens myself.\n\nI trusted a cosmetic dentist in southern Brazil, the parent of an exchange student I once hosted, and the cost was far more realistic than in the United States. After surgery and the initial healing, I traveled to Rio. For the first time in years, I felt free to focus my lens and smile at the world around me without hesitation.\n\nThe physical and financial weight I had carried for years began to lift. Brazil restored my confidence and reminded me that reinvention was still possible.\n\nBefore selling my house, I had researched ways to travel while working. A friend hosted dinners as a sommelier on cruise ships, and my algorithm kept suggesting photography jobs at sea. I applied to a few with curiosity.\n\nWhile I was still in Rio, the call came. I was offered a contract as the master photographer on a premium luxury cruise line, a role that would take me across multiple continents. To qualify, I needed a Seafarer Certificate, which at my age required extensive medical tests and functional exams. It was humbling, but I passed.\n\nI was notified with less than a week to prepare that my contract would start in Sydney. After a 31-hour flight, knowing I would board within 24 hours, I dropped my bags at the hotel and walked the waterfront from Darling Harbor to the Opera House. A mist hung in the air, turning the city into a soft shimmer through my lens.\n\nLife at sea was a study in contrasts. I photographed in a studio on the 15th floor but slept far below in a windowless cabin. I climbed endless flights of stairs each day. The ancient programs, cameras, and equipment made my days long and tedious. But above deck, the ocean made everything worth it. An unobstructed sunset on open water can shift your entire mood. Each time we reached a new port, the world opened again. My creative mojo began to gel for the first time in a long while, and I realized I was able to absorb so much only because I had let go of so much.\n\nIn six months, I had visited three continents, become healthier than I had been in years, and for the first time in decades, my smile came without hesitation. My financial responsibilities felt lighter, and the spark I had been missing finally came back after years of accumulating belongings and obligations that had kept me anchored when I was ready to sail into another chapter filled with creativity.\n\nWhile recovering in Miami from an injury, I received another unexpected call. An apartment had become available in the Asbury Park building where I had applied years earlier. It had an ocean view, a community of artists and musicians, and a rent I could actually afford. It felt like the universe was giving me the chance to finally act on my hopes and creativity.\n\nI had let go of everything that once held me back. What I gained was freedom, the freedom to create, to travel, and to smile freely again, with my camera as my ticket forward.",

    "title": "Boston Dynamics CEO told us how the humanoid robot revolution begins",
    "description": "Boston Dynamics CEO Robert Playter spoke to Business Insider on how humanoid robots will take over the factory and when they'll come to our homes.",
    "fullText": "In a few years, factory employees at Hyundai's massive Georgia plant could be getting a new coworker.\n\nIt's about 200 pounds, six-feet, two-inches tall, has a four-hour battery life, and a face inspired by Disney's Pixar lamp, Luxor Jr.\n\nIts name is Atlas, an all-electric humanoid robot from Boston Dynamics, the Massachusetts-based company and maker of the four-legged inspection robot, Spot, and the mobile warehouse robot, Stretch.\n\nHyundai, which owns Boston Dynamics, unveiled the latest version of Atlas at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on January 5. During live demonstrations, Atlas was seen waving hello to its audience before moving car parts from one rack to another.\n\nThis is how the humanoid robot revolution starts, according to Boston Dynamics CEO Robert Playter.\n\n\"We're starting with the simpler stuff, which is parts sequencing,\" Playter said in an interview with Business Insider. Eventually, the tasks get more complex, and Atlas will be on the assembly line. Then, the CEO said, perhaps in five to 10 years' time, the robots will enter our homes.\n\nPlayter, an MIT alumn and aerospace engineer by training, has been at Boston Dynamics for more than 30 years and has seen the company change hands multiple times — first to Google, then to SoftBank, and now to Hyundai after the South Korean automaker acquired a majority stake in the robotics company five years ago.\n\nPlayter was appointed CEO in 2019. Since then, he has steered the company through its commercial launch of Spot, Atlas' transition from a hydraulics platform to an all-electric platform, and more recently, Boston Dynamics' partnership with Google DeepMind, Alphabet's AI research lab, to help build Atlas' \"brain.\"\n\nThe CEO spoke to Business Insider on the Atlas demonstration floor about how humanoid robots will transform the workplace before they take over our homes, the problems still to be solved before humanoids can work, and why Atlas looks like a Disney-inspired character.\n\nThe interview was edited for length and clarity.\n\nIs there a story behind Atlas' face?\n\nAbsolutely. A lot of the humanoid producers create what I would call scary, dystopian robot faces. It's like, oh my god, there's this black face. Is that a human shape? Why can't I see it? It's just scary.\n\nSo we tried to go the other way, and the shape is really driven from the Pixar lamp, the original friendly mechanism. We wanted to forecast that this is not a human. It is a machine — it's a friendly machine.\n\nIs this what you imagined the robot takeover looking like when you were at MIT about 40 years ago?\n\nI think it's what we dreamed about. But we've been doing humanoids since 2008. We've been doing this for a long time. But for us to be approaching a point where we're really thinking about commercializing the humanoid, I don't know that we expected that years ago. The turning point has been AI. It's really the enabler that lets a robot like this do a huge variety of tasks, which is what's needed to really make these generalizable.\n\nIs AI the main technological advancement that's transformed the robot?\n\nThere's a lot of hardware advancements as well. The early robots were hydraulic. These are all electric. This is our newest version that is going to be mass-produced. And it's designed for simplicity and cost. If you notice, there's a lot of similar joints and shapes on this robot — it's really built to be modular. There's only three different types of motors, which means we're going to be able to mass-produce them at scale and get the cost down. The joints all have 360-degree rotation, which is why you see these crazy inside-out yoga motion. And it's strong. This robot's going to be able to pick up 110 pounds.\n\nA few years ago, Aaron Saunders, the former CTO, talked about the bipedal form factor and how it's not the best for every task. That's why you have Stretch, for example, to carry boxes. Has that mentality shifted at Boston?\n\nI think we're still going to see lots of different morphologies for different applications. But one of the great things about humanoids is people are just fascinated by them, and they could be truly general-purpose. With two manipulators, you could basically pick up and put down almost anything that a person could do. You can go to almost any place that a person can go to.\n\nIs the tradeoff of tackling the technical challenges of doing a humanoid worth it compared to sticking with a robot like Stretch that can perform limited tasks but is already deployed?\n\nDefinitely, there's more complexity. This has 56 degrees of freedom. Stretch is going to work in warehouses. Humanoids could potentially work anywhere and eventually in our homes. So the generality of this shape is really what lends it power. It's the best robot we've ever built. It's the one we've built to be mass-producible right out of the gate. But there's still complexity that has to get solved. Part of that's in the AI. We've solved a lot of the hardware parts; now we need to go solve the AI problems.\n\nSo there's still something to solve between now and 2028 deployment.\n\nAbsolutely. What we've seen is that AI techniques allow us to get an unprecedented diversity of skills onto the robots quickly, but we really need to generalize that. If you're going to have a robot that's actually useful in the factory, it's got to do a hundred different tasks, not just one or two. And it's really the AI that's going to enable that. We also have to make that unprecedented reliability — 99.9% reliable. The AI is not quite there yet, but it's very promising.\n\nIs there a specific number of tasks Atlas needs to achieve that will make it ready to be shipped out?\n\nWe need to be able to bring a new task to bear in a day or two. And that's because, I think in a factory, there's literally hundreds of tasks, and the tasks evolve. So yeah, every 24 or 48 hours to get a new task onto a robot.\n\nHow do you imagine Atlas transforming the workplace, starting with the factory?\n\nThere's a lot of logistics work that has to be done in an automotive factory — a huge variety of pick-and-place tasks to get all the pieces of the car to the line. Atlas is going to start in that sequencing — it's called parts sequencing. It's really a logistics task. And as the capabilities get more sophisticated, we're going to eventually start entering assembly tasks. We're going to deal with heavy lifting, repeatable tasks that tend to wear people out. That's kind of what we're doing with Stretch, which is unloading trailing. The people who used to unload trailers now operate the robot. We see the same thing happening in factories. Factory workers are going to be the trainers of these new technologies.\n\nCan the workers interact with the robots and talk to them?\n\nYes. We have demonstrations of some of these behaviors where we just tell the robot, \"Empty out this bin of parts,\" and it'll go do that. That is all part of the package, and we really want to just make it a seamless interaction.\n\nIs there a list of tasks you believe Atlas will be best for and ones that Atlas will avoid?\n\nWe've analyzed all the jobs that have to occur in an automotive factory. We're starting with the simpler stuff, which is parts sequencing. And then above that, you have gradations of complexity. Do you have to get inside the car to fit something? Do you have to do a close-tolerant fit? Do you have to deal with flexible wiring harness? Those things are more complex, and it's going to take more time to bring to bear. So, we're starting with the simple stuff, and then it'll grow over time.\n\nThere's a lot of ambivalence around robots taking over our jobs. Has Boston Dynamics done an analysis of how many jobs one Atlas can actually replace or take on?\n\nLet me get to the ambivalence. There's a feeling of a little anxiety around robots in general. What we're actually finding when we bring robots into the workplace is that people end up enjoying interacting with the robots.\n\nSome of the people who used to unload trailers now operate Stretch. They just got upskilled. They like their job more now that Stretch is doing the heavy-lifting. And I think there's a great potential with AI-powered robots that anybody can interact with them and train them. It will not require an advanced engineering degree, and that essentially opens up the productivity enhancements to regular workers. I think it's going to be a symbiosis.\n\nSo, less about human replacement?\n\nI think so. We're going to build a whole new industry. There's going to be a lot of jobs created just building, maintaining, deploying, and training robots.\n\nAnd if you've paid attention to demographic trends worldwide, population has decreased everywhere. If we're going to bring manufacturing back to the United States, we have to increase productivity. And I think robotics is a way to increase the productivity of our workforce.\n\nSo Boston Dynamics doesn't have a metric or ratio — like, one Atlas robot can do the job of five humans?\n\nI think it depends totally on the task. And so we don't have that metric yet. The way we measure that in the Stretch is it's all about case pick rate: How many boxes can you pick per hour, and how does that compare to the humans that did that job? And we pretty much have to at least match that. In some cases, we can exceed it, but in some cases, people are still better because the robots aren't quite smarter.\n\nHow do you pitch companies on Atlas? Do you tell them they can save X amount of money?\n\nWe have experience doing this with Spot. Companies typically want to see a return on investment in around two to three years.\n\nWe talk a lot about AI talent wars. Is it competitive for Boston Dynamics?\n\nHoly, it's crazy. We need the same AI talent that Meta and Google and Nvidia are all hiring, so it's extremely competitive. The thing we have that nobody else has, which is important for the top talent, is really exciting robots.\n\nDo you have Atlas running around in your home right now for testing?\n\nNo, we have it in the lab. We had Spots at home. During COVID, everybody had to go home, and our developers just took the robots home with them. We probably paid for the damage to the house when they ran into the walls.\n\nHa, the real test case. Well, the goal with Atlas is to bring them home, too, right?\n\nEventually. We see industrial as the first stepping stone for three reasons.\n\nCost. These first robots are going to be a little bit too expensive for consumer level. Safety. Factories are a safer environment. You can control it a little bit more than the home. And then capabilities.\n\nAt home, you've got the worst of all worlds. It has to be the cheapest, it has to be the most safe, and it's the most complex environment.\n\nWe're going to get to home, I'd say, in five to 10 years. The next five years we're really focusing on industrial applications.\n\nIs there something your competitors don't understand about deploying humanoid robots?\n\nI think they understand it just fine. They're just playing a slightly different game.\n\nThis is a very expensive business to be in. It takes billions of dollars of investment to sort of get this technology to where it needs to be. If you're going to play that game, you got to have the largest possible market. So, of course, they're saying they're going to go home. It's the large end market, but I just think that's a mistake.",

    "fullText": "Private jets are descending on the typically quiet ski town of Davos as the masters of the universe make their way to Switzerland for the World Economic Forum.\n\nBill Gates, Nvidia's Jensen Huang, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon are among the business leaders scheduled to attend, along with world leaders like French President Emmanuel Macron, Argentina's Javier Milei, and Donald Trump.\n\nIt's unlikely any of these titans will fly commercial.\n\nLast year, private aviation traffic in the region during WEF week was about five times the usual level, with more than 150 jets landing at area airports, according to JetSpy, which tracks FAA-registered aircraft.\n\nThey were registered to billionaires like Michael Dell and Robert Smith, and hailed from Palm Beach and Dubai, Paris, and Doha.\n\nThis weekend, corporate jets owned by Google, BlackRock, and IBM were among those that arrived in the area, according to data from JetSpy.\n\nFew WEF attendees will fly into Engadin Airport, the airport closest to Davos and the highest in Europe by altitude.\n\n\"For many years, the WEF week has actually been one of the quietest weeks of the winter season for us,\" Christian Gorfer, the airport's chief financial officer, told Business Insider in an email.\n\nDue to airspace restrictions within a 25 nautical mile radius of Davos, all flights to and from Engadin require prior authorisation from the Swiss Air Force.\n\n\"Some of our regular customers do fly in and out during that week, but WEF participants generally do not make their way to [Engadin],\" Gorfer said.\n\nInstead, many private jets and government airplanes will arrive at the Zurich Airport alongside regular airlines. It's about a two-hour drive away from the Alpine town, but the wealthiest people will travel by helicopter instead.\n\nThe airport estimated there will be an extra 1,000 takeoffs and landings during the conference, with some landing after its typically strict curfew of 11:30 p.m. Zurich Airport is also extending the opening hours for an observation deck for planespotters and other aviation enthusiasts.\n\nOthers fly into Germany's Friedrichshafen Airport, a Jetspy spokesperson told Business Insider.\n\nThe jets will be a parade of some of the most expensive on the market.\n\nMany opt for the Gulfstream G650, which costs tens of millions and was the transport of choice for attendees like Gates, Louis Bacon, and executives from BlackRock and Goldman Sachs last year. Others fly on the Bombardier Global 7500, which has been dubbed the \"Ferrari of the Skies.\"",

    "fullText": "BAGHDAD (AP) — U.S. forces have fully withdrawn from an air base in western Iraq in implementation of an agreement with the Iraqi government, Iraqi officials said Saturday.\n\nWashington and Baghdad agreed in 2024 to wind down a U.S.-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group in Iraq by September 2025, with U.S. forces departing bases where they had been stationed.\n\nHowever, a small unit of U.S. military advisers and support personnel remained. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani in October told journalists that the agreement originally stipulated a full pullout of U.S. forces from the Ain al-Asad air base in western Iraq by September. But “developments in Syria” since then required maintaining a “small unit” of between 250 and 350 advisers and security personnel at the base.\n\nNow all U.S. personnel have departed.\n\nIraqi Army Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Abdul Amir Rashid Yarallah oversaw the assignment of tasks and duties to various military units at the base on Saturday following the withdrawal of U.S. forces and the Iraqi Army’s full assumption of control over the base, the military said in a statement.\n\nThe statement added that Yarallah “instructed relevant authorities to intensify efforts, enhance joint work, and coordinate between all units stationed at the base, while making full use of its capabilities and strategic location.”\n\nA Ministry of Defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly confirmed that all U.S. forces had departed the base and had also removed all American equipment from it.\n\nThere was no statement from the U.S. military on the withdrawal.\n\nU.S. forces have retained a presence in the semi-autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq and in neighboring Syria.\n\nThe departure of U.S. forces may strengthen the hand of the government in discussions around disarmament of non-state armed groups in the country, some of which have used the presence of U.S. troops as justification for keeping their own weapons.\n\nAl-Sudani said in a July interview with The Associated Press that once the coalition withdrawal is complete, “there will be no need or no justification for any group to carry weapons outside the scope of the state.”",

    "description": "I chose open, honest conversations with my kids about sex, drugs, and mistakes, even when others judged my parenting style.",
    "fullText": "Growing up, the grandparents who raised me were a generation removed from me, and because of it, I never felt like I could go to them with real issues or problems.\n\nI hid the deep and dark stuff because children were to be seen and not heard. We did not talk about the big things like sex or drugs. Instead, the warnings were direct and often frightening. They went something like this, \"Do not do drugs or you'll die.\" The pregnancy mantra was similar: \"Do not have sex or you'll get pregnant.\"\n\nAlongside the lack of communication was a heavy dose of fear and threats. I suppose their own parents passed down less-than-stellar communication skills and used threats in an effort to protect.\n\nI remember coming home after having a few drinks at a high school party. \"You can do this one step at a time. Say hello and walk (in a straight line) to your room,\" I whispered to myself as I climbed the steep front steps leading to our second-floor apartment. There was no getting caught, or I would die, or at least endure endless punishments preventing me from going to said parties until I was an adult capable of making my own decisions.\n\nNot only did I not know how to talk to my grandparents, but I was also terrified of them.\n\nSometimes, this lack of communication led to unwise decisions. I didn't feel like I had an adult I could call if I'd done something I wasn't supposed to do. If I did something foolish, I was on my own. It wasn't safe, and I'd watched more than one friend get seriously injured (either physically or mentally) when they made a typical teen choice and felt they didn't have an adult they could trust to help them.\n\nWith my own kids, I wanted to keep the lines of communication open, which became especially important as my children navigated middle school and high school. These years of adolescence included poor decision-making and a desperate struggle between being a kid and trying to grow up.\n\nI talked openly with them about drugs, sex, and drinking. No subject was off limits. They knew they could tell me anything. Keeping our communication open and honest showed them a level of trust that other parents found difficult to understand. I often had my kids' friends telling me things they couldn't say to their parents. I tried to listen without judgment. I knew it was a fine line between discipline and acceptance. I also knew no matter what, keeping my kids safe was my first and most important job as a parent.\n\nAs my second set of kids head into the muddy waters of middle school and high school, these discussions are again at the forefront. \"If you drink, I'll be more upset if you get in a car with someone who's been drinking or if you decide to drive than I will because of the drinking,\" I recently told my high school daughter. Realistically, while I don't openly condone underage drinking, I know it is, more often than not, a part of the teen years. \"Call me,\" I said, \"and I'll come get you.\n\nWhile there were many things I did not accept, I also did my best to remain open-minded. It was sometimes difficult to parent this way. My kids did and continue to do things I often don't agree with. I looked at these as teaching opportunities, rather than seeing them as moments to punish. Viewing things this way has helped me foster and maintain very close relationships with my kids. It is something others have commented on, including a social worker I visited with my son. \"No matter what is going on,\" she said, \"you two seem to have a really tight and open relationship.\" It remains one of the best compliments I've received as a parent.\n\nThere was another side to those comments, though. Parenthood is often filled with judgment and criticism. When my son dropped out of school, and my teens struggled with typical teen things like drinking, drug use, and sex, I remember hearing a neighbor refer to me as a loosey goosey parent. The neighbor in question didn't understand my relationship with my kids. They didn't share my parenting philosophy. Really, they didn't have to. While the comment initially bothered me, I knew I was parenting in the only way I could. I parented in a way that I wasn't parented, but wished that I had been.\n\nAs my two oldest kids hit adulthood and my youngest two become teenagers, I'm not sorry for being loosey goosey. I would do it the same way all over again. In fact, I am. I have no regrets. I hope the neighbor who judged me feels the same way when their kids go through the tough teen years.",

    "description": "My husband and I moved from a major city to a small French village. After two years, I accepted that the country wasn't a good fit for my lifestyle.",
    "fullText": "Growing up in a remote California suburb, I spent most of my childhood counting down the days until I could leave for a big city.\n\nWhen the time came to move to New York for college, I was prepared to say goodbye to country living for good. I spent six years in New York, and then another four in Berlin.\n\nAlthough I loved my experiences in both cities, I was exhausted. Years of apartment hopping, navigating dirty subways, and dealing with nonstop hustle left me craving a reprieve — and wondering why I'd been so quick to swear off a quainter life in the country.\n\nSo, when my husband proposed that we move to a little village near his family in France, I surprised myself by agreeing to give it a try.\n\nThis was in 2021, when COVID-19 restrictions were making it challenging to live in Berlin, and we were both desperate for the benefits that such a relocation could offer — like more square footage, a yard, and, most importantly, proximity to our loved ones and their support.\n\nThe reservations I had about residing in the country were still nagging me, but I figured things would be different this time. I was older, wiser, and doing it in beautiful France, of all places.\n\nI wish I had listened to my gut, though, because all my old qualms with country living ended up rearing their ugly heads — and we ended up leaving after two years.\n\nI never needed a driver's license when I lived in cities, but that all changed when we moved to the French village. There, we simply couldn't get around without a car — but we sure tried.\n\nI knew going in that my public transportation options would be more limited than they were in a city, but I didn't expect to be as isolated as we were.\n\nWhen we first arrived, it took us over a month to work up the funds to buy a car. In the meantime, we attempted one very hilly bike ride, but had to call it quits before we'd even made it halfway to our destination.\n\nWalking was no better — it took hours to get to the nearest shops, and sometimes they wouldn't even be open when we finally arrived.\n\nEven after we obtained a vehicle, I couldn't navigate on my own without my husband, since he was the only one with a license.\n\nHe was always willing to drive me around, but I was frustrated by my newfound lack of independence. I considered getting a license of my own, but the cost of driving school was out of our budget at the time, so it really seemed like there was no way out of the situation I'd gotten myself into.\n\nApartment life certainly has its drawbacks, but extra square footage comes with pitfalls, too.\n\nWe loved that our rental home gave us the newfound ability to stretch out and make noise without bothering each other. The downside, though, was that it was up to us to care for and maintain all that extra space.\n\nIt wasn't just the house, either — it was also our responsibility to tend to the adjoining garden, barn, and the attached horse stables. It was a full-time job's worth of work, and I started to miss the days when I could clean my whole apartment in just an afternoon.\n\nNormally, I'm a proponent of cooking as much of my own food as possible, but I at least like to have the option of ordering in or eating out — especially on days full of chores and work.\n\nUnfortunately, getting to the closest takeout restaurant took an hour round-trip, and delivery applications like Uber Eats didn't service our small village.\n\nWhat's more, our dining options were severely limited compared to what we'd had in Berlin. I realized that I missed trying different cuisines and checking out new restaurants, and even when cooking,\n\nI didn't have access to the same wide variety of ingredients that I'd had in the city. One example was sesame oil — if I wanted to use this pantry staple in a recipe, I'd have to go to a big city to find it.\n\nOur village was extremely small — as of 2020, the population was under 400 — and many of the people I met were much older.\n\nNeedless to say, our rhythms and beliefs didn't always match up. We often had debates over everything from politics to local initiatives — like what to do with all the feral cats — and it wasn't always easy to argue my point in my then-limited French.\n\nSince most folks in Berlin are fluent in English, I'd never been up against such a language barrier before. All that and more made it challenging to form true connections and further contributed to my feelings of isolation.\n\nDespite all my frustrations, there were a few great things about living in the French countryside.\n\nFor starters, it really is beautiful, and being there allowed me to grow my own fruit and vegetables, forage wild blackberries in the forest, and perfect my French with the folks in town who were willing and patient enough to help me out.\n\nAfter two years, we ended up moving to Lyon, the nearest city, because it offered the best of both worlds. At only 84 miles away, we'd have proximity to my husband's family and access to nature, plus all the advantages of living in a major city.\n\nI'll always remember the beautiful memories from my time in the village — but I'll also always prefer to reminisce about them from an apartment in a city.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian drone strikes damaged energy networks in Russia-occupied parts of southern Ukraine, leaving hundreds of thousands of people without power on Sunday, according to Kremlin-installed authorities there.\n\nMeanwhile, Moscow has kept up its hammering of Ukraine’s energy grid in overnight attacks that killed at least two people, according to Ukrainian officials.\n\nMore than 200,000 households in the Russia-held part of Ukraine’s southern Zaporizhzhia region had no electricity on Sunday, according to the Kremlin-installed local governor.\n\nIn a Telegram post, Yevgeny Balitsky said that nearly 400 settlements have had their supply cut, because of damage to power networks from Ukrainian drone strikes.\n\nRussia has hammered Ukraine’s power grid, especially in winter, throughout the nearly four-year war. The strikes aim to weaken Ukrainians’ will to resist in a strategy that Kyiv officials call “weaponizing winter.”\n\nRussia targeted energy infrastructure in Odesa region overnight on Sunday, according to Ukraine’s Emergency Service. A fire broke out and was promptly extinguished.\n\nAt least six people were wounded in the Dnipropetrovsk region from Russian attacks, the emergency service said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a Telegram post that repairing the country’s energy system remains challenging, “but we are doing everything we can to restore everything as quickly as possible.”\n\nHe said that two people were killed in overnight attacks across the country that struck Sumy, Kharkiv, Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia, Khmelnytskyi and Odesa.\n\nIn total, more than 1,300 attack drones, 1,050 guided aerial bombs and 29 missiles of various types were used by Russia to strike Ukraine this week, Zelenskyy said.\n\n“If Russia deliberately delays the diplomatic process, the world’s response should be decisive: more help for Ukraine and more pressure on the aggressor,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nHe spoke the day after a Ukrainian delegation arrived in the United States for talks on a U.S.-led diplomatic push to end the war.\n\nOn Friday, Zelenskyy said that the delegation would try to finalize with U.S. officials documents for a proposed peace settlement that relate to postwar security guarantees and economic recovery.\n\nIf American officials approve the proposals, the U.S. and Ukraine could sign the documents next week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Zelenskyy said at a Kyiv news conference with Czech President Petr Pavel. Trump plans to be in Davos, according to organizers.\n\nRussia would still need to be consulted on the proposals.\n\nSeparately, in Russia’s Caucasus mountains, two children and an adult were wounded overnight as debris from a Ukrainian drone fell on a five-story residential building in North Ossetia, according to the regional governor.\n\nSeventy people had to be evacuated from the building, in the town of Beslan, and there was damage to its roof and windows, Gov. Sergei Menyaylo said in a Telegram post on Sunday morning.\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry said that its forces shot down or suppressed 63 Ukrainian drones overnight over Russia and the occupied Crimean Peninsula. One person was hospitalized in Russia’s Krasnodar region east of Crimea following a drone strike, local authorities said.\n\nUkrainian crews have started repair works on the backup power line connecting the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant to the power grid, under a ceasefire brokered by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Vienna-based U.N. organization said in an X post on Sunday.\n\nThe fate of the plant, occupied by Russia and the largest in Europe, is a central issue in ongoing U.S.-brokered peace talks.\n\n“Crucial repair works on the essential back up Ferosplavna-1 330 kV power line connecting Ukraine’s ZNPP to the grid have begun under another IAEA-brokered ceasefire,” the agency said in the post.\n\nThe 330-kilovolt power line, which was damaged and disconnected because of fighting, is crucial to supplying the plant with electricity.",

    "fullText": "It's hard to beat a nice, peaceful bike ride to clear your mind, but for one biker, a leisurely afternoon ride was interrupted by a heart-stopping encounter with a roaming mountain lion.\n\nTikToker Trevor Shor (@trevorshor) went for a bike ride with his father on a set of trails in Newbury Park, California.\n\nAlthough the sun was shining, their afternoon nearly turned into a complete nightmare.\n\nShor managed to film a mountain lion exiting the brush just feet away from the bike trail.\n\n\"Saw it pop out of the bushes, it noticed us, froze and locked eyes with me. It stayed there for a good 30 seconds or so and then finally started walking down the path,\" Shor wrote.\n\n\"Eventually it ran off the road into the hills again.\"\n\nAs a user observed in the comments section, one odd detail about the mountain lion immediately stood out: the animal appeared to have a collar around its neck.\n\n\"That collar means he's being tracked for research,\" they wrote.\n\n\"So cool. But still so scary coming face to face with it,\" Shor replied.\n\nWhile it wasn't clear how long the mountain lion had been monitored or by whom, the species' presence wasn't unheard of in Southern California.\n\nWhat would it take to sell your car and start riding a bike?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nHowever, the mountain lion population in California isn't quite as robust as many assume.\n\nIn 2024, the Los Angeles Times reported that there were a couple thousand fewer mountain lions in the state than previously thought.\n\nA study led by researchers from the California Mountain Lion Project estimated that there were between 3,200 and 4,500 mountain lions, a far cry from the original estimate of 6,000.\n\nDespite a smaller estimated population, mountain lion sightings are still somewhat common in rural areas of California.\n\nBut as human activity expands into mountain lions' natural habitat, the species can be forced out of its territory in search of food and seclusion.\n\nIn early 2025, the Ventura County Sheriff's Office posted on Facebook after a cluster of mountain lion sightings was reported in the area. The post offered plenty of useful tips for staying safe.\n\n\"If you see a mountain lion, especially one feeding or with offspring, keep your distance. Most mountain lions prefer to avoid confrontation,\" the department began.\n\n\"If you encounter a mountain lion, do not run. Instead, face the animal, make noise, and try to appear larger.\"\n\nMountain lions are a vital species that help maintain ecosystem health by controlling their prey, such as deer and elk, preventing the overgrazing of plants, and protecting crucial waterways.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

(FOX 2) - The snow may have stopped, but more is expected over the weekend and next week. Hopefully, it won’t lead to pile-ups on the roads like the one on 26 Mile that sent five to the hospital on Thursday.\n\nOn Friday night, FOX 2 heard from the husband of the woman and children in the other vehicle and got his perspective. His name is Ethan Dunlap, and he took some of the photos at the scene of the crash.\n\nOn Wednesday, Chesterfield Township police say two vehicles collided head-on on eastbound 26 Mile, west of I-94.\n\nOfficials say one vehicle was occupied by a 59-year-old woman and a passenger. On the other, a 25-year-old and two kids. All of them were taken to the hospital.\n\nFOX 2 heard from an uncle of one of the families in the vehicles who said there was no 59-year-old. It was his 41-year-old sister and 16-year-old niece who were severely injured and that they were T-boned.\n\nOn Friday, FOX 2 heard from Ethan Dunlap, the husband and father of the 25-year-old and kids in the other vehicle.\n\nDunlap says as soon as his wife called him, he rushed to the scene.\n\nHe says police and the fire department told him at the scene that the other vehicle lost control, spun out, came into his wife’s lane where they hit head-on, and then the other vehicle turned sideways.\n\n\"I feel horrible for what happened to the mom and the daughter,\" said Ethan Dunlap. \"They definitely got the worst of it. My kids are doing alright. My wife is pretty beat up. She can’t lift her left arm. She has pretty severe bruising, and it’s just — we had to drive her to the police department to get the police report, and she was terrified the entire time. So definitely some psychological damage.\"\n\nAgain, he says the children are okay.\n\nEveryone is out of the hospital. His message to all drivers was to slow down.",

    "title": "Andrew Quietly Clears $30M Inheritance For Beatrice & Eugenie as Sources Claim His Daughters Are ‘Absolutely Fuming’ Over The Loss of Their ‘Easy Retirement’",
    "description": "What did he do?",
    "fullText": "The situation with disgraced former Prince Andrew affects not only him, but also his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, and his daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie. Andrew has now been stripped of his titles and ordered to vacate his home at Royal Lodge due to repeated scandals tied to his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. But how has this really affected his daughters?\n\nReportedly, the King evicting Andrew out of Royal Lodge, where he held a 75-year lease, will end up hurting the two quite a bit, as Andrew was reportedly hoping he could one day hand over the property to his daughters.\n\nEugenie Accused of Snubbing Kate's Birthday After Reports She Was Caught 'Trash-Talking' William-She Has 'Bad Feelings' Toward the Prince\n\nAndrew Has Reportedly 'Turned His Wrath' on 'Perfect Villain' Kate After Being 'Forced Out' of the Royal Family-He Sees Her as 'Poison'\n\nNow, property expert Elliot Castle, of We Buy Any Home, says that the door for any potential inheritance has closed “entirely”.\n\n“[This] would only have been possible while the lease remained in place,” he said. “Once that lease is surrendered or terminated, there is nothing to pass on. From a property standpoint, that closes the door entirely. Royal Lodge would revert fully to the Crown Estate, with no residual claim for Andrew or his daughters.”\n\nIn the lease there were specifications about the conditions the property needed to be kept in, and a clause where Andrew had to “permit the landlord [Crown Estate] and persons authorised by the landlord at all reasonable times upon reasonable notice to enter upon the premises to ascertain whether the tenant’s obligations herein have been complied with and to examine their state and condition and use and to take a plan or prepare a schedule of fixtures or a schedule of dilapidations and to make valuations.”\n\nReportedly, however, the property was not inspected once in the 22 years Andrew lived there.\n\nWith Royal Lodge being worth £30m, passing them onto Beatrice and Eugenie would have meant a pretty sizable inheritance. But it is not to be.\n\nAnd RadarOnline.com is reporting that the two expected the property would go to them, so the loss of that has left them “fuming” at the injustice. “There was an expectation that Royal Lodge would one day benefit Beatrice and Eugenie, even if only as a safety net. That has now gone completely.”\n\n“They are angry because this is not about extravagance. It was about long-term security that has been wiped out. Their dream of an easy life in retirement is now gone,” a source said.\n\nPart of their anger comes from expectations about what it meant to have a lease on the property. “The understanding was that the arrangement insulated the property from short-term drama. That belief has proved badly misplaced.”\n\nBoth Beatrice and Eugenie have homes, so this was never about them moving into Royal Lodge. A source said, “This was not just a place to live. It was a valuable leasehold asset that justified significant personal investment over time.”\n\nAnother source said: “Neither princess needs Royal Lodge for housing, but losing a $40million asset changes the shape of their futures,” adding, “They feel they are paying the price for decisions they did not make. The anger is real, and it is directed squarely at how their father’s scandal keeps shrinking their options.”\n\nThe 26 Best Romantic Comedies to Watch if You Want to Know What Love Feels Like\n\nThese ‘Bachelor’ Secrets & Rules Prove What Happens Behind the Scenes Is So Much Juicier\n\nBTS's 7 Members Were Discovered in the Most Unconventional Ways",

    "fullText": "Tries: Tchumbadze 2, Dweba, Heaven, Brown-Bampoe Cons: Slade 3\n\nBachuki Tchumbadze scored an early double as Exeter Chiefs overcame a reshuffled Cardiff side to book a home tie in the last 16 of the European Challenge Cup.\n\nThe Chiefs' tighthead prop went over twice at Sandy Park before hooker Joseph Dweba extended their lead to 19-0 at the break.\n\nExeter revamped their forward line after a sluggish start to the second half and Dweba's replacement Julian Heaven scored a further try to secure a bonus point.\n\nPaul Brown-Bampoe dived over for the Chiefs' fifth try late on, with Henry Slade adding three conversions.\n\nExeter will now host Munster in the knockout phase in early April, with Cardiff travelling to Benetton.\n\nWelsh trio learn Challenge Cup knockout opponents\n\nWith Cardiff making 10 changes to their line-up, the home side quickly set about their task, applying pressure and forcing an early flood of penalties.\n\nAlthough the visitors escaped punishment for what looked a high tackle on Harvey Skinner, Exeter immediately regrouped at a line-out and Tchumbadze burrowed over for the opening score.\n\nA foul on Stephen Varney then earned Cardiff's Rory Thornton a trip to the sin-bin and, by the time the second row returned to the field, his side were trailing by 19 points.\n\nTchumbadze's second try of the game was confirmed by TMO Marius Jonker and just a few minutes later, another dominant line-out and drive resulted in Dweba forcing his way over in the corner.\n\nThat gave the Chiefs a commanding lead at the turnaround but Cardiff raised their game at the start of the second period, running the ball to good effect and gaining territory as they forced the hosts back.\n\nIt looked as though Cardiff would gain some reward for their efforts when Ioan Lloyd sent a chip through for Tom Bowen to gather and dot down – only for the try to be ruled out for a knock-on in the build-up.\n\nInstead, it was Exeter who scored again after Ethan Roots won possession at the line-out and Heaven darted away to dive over the whitewash.\n\nThe Chiefs finished the game with a flourish as Skinner's crafty ball set up Brown-Bampoe to complete the scoring late on.\n\nExeter Chiefs defence coach Haydn Thomas told BBC Radio Devon:\n\n\"The boys fought really hard in tough conditions. I thought we had great discipline, we went the tough route and didn't go for any cheap fixes.\n\n\"You've got to look at how hard the forwards and backs worked and the quality of the set-piece was the foundation of it, turning over lineouts and that kind of stuff.\n\n\"I thought we were fantastic with our territory, our kicking game and credit to the forwards with the mauls, the pick and go stuff. We were on it in that first half, that's for sure.\n\n\"Cardiff got a foot in the game but we always stayed in the fight, never gave up on anything and came back with a nice bonus point try, then to get another try at the end was excellent.\"\n\nExeter: Woodburn; Feyi-Waboso, Slade, Haydon-Wood, Brown-Bampoe; Skinner, Varney; Sio, Dweba, Tchumbadze, Jenkins, Zambonin, Hooper, E Roots, James.\n\nReplacements: Heaven, Goodrick-Clarke, J Roots, Tuima, Pearson, Capstick, Chapman, Hammersley.\n\nCardiff: Beetham; Grady, Smit, Jennings, Bowen; I Lloyd, Mulder; Southworth, E Lloyd, Wainwright, McNally, Thornton, Botham, Thomas, Basham.\n\nReplacements: Hughes, Domachowski, Sebastian, Nott, Lawrence, Cottle, Davies, Winnett.",

It was a case of going all out for one more year,\" said Jones, who has received direct entry into a Grand Slam for the first time.\n\n\"If I would have been [ranked] 101, I wasn't going to quit.

    "fullText": "Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United all cruised into the fifth round of the Women's FA Cup as 55 goals were scored across 12 matches on Sunday.\n\nTop-flight strugglers Liverpool banished their goalscoring woes by putting six past fourth-tier London Bees, with five separate players on the scoresheet including debutants Denise O'Sullivan and Martha Thomas.\n\nWomen's Super League leaders City cruised to a 6-0 win at third-tier Bournemouth, after Khadija Shaw opened the scoring with a thumping 19th-minute header.\n\nThree further goals - a Lauren Hemp drive and a double from Laura Coombs - settled the contest before half-time, with substitute Vivianne Miedema netting twice after the break as City stretched their unbeaten run to 16 games in all competitions.\n\nTheir Manchester rivals United also made light work of their tie against third-tier Burnley with a 5-0 victory.\n\nCaptain Maya Le Tissier put Marc Skinner's side ahead after two minutes, with new signing Lea Schuller and 16-year-old academy graduate Layla Drury also on target.\n\nIn the only all-WSL tie of the round, 14-time winners Arsenal battled to a 2-0 victory over Aston Villa, with captain Kim Little claiming a goal and an assist.\n\n\"She is unbelievable. She does everything 100%. She can really perform at this level,\" Arsenal manager Renee Slegers told Channel 4.\n\nSecond-tier Nottingham Forest pushed Brighton - without manager Dario Vidosic, who was absent for personal reasons - all the way at Broadfield Stadium.\n\nBrighton edged in front through Madison Hayley's penalty on the stroke of half-time before Jelena Cankovic's header secured victory late on.\n\nWSL 2 frontrunners Charlton Athletic were the highest scorers of the weekend, netting 10 without reply in an emphatic display against Swindon Town.\n\nBristol City got the better of fellow WSL 2 side Southampton in the only tie that required extra time. The Robins levelled late in the second half to force an additional 30 minutes, before Emily Syme completed the turnaround in the 118th minute.\n\nMeanwhile fellow second-tier clubs Birmingham City and Sheffield United are also through after 6-2 and 2-1 wins over Hull City and Ipswich, and Oxford United saw off Middlesborough 3-1 in the only all-third tier fixture.\n\nYork City of the National League were the lowest-ranked side left in the competition, but their history-making run to the fourth round ended with a 3-0 loss at Chatham Town.",

    "description": "Aprilia's Rivola is aware that retaining Bezzecchi and Martin in 2027 won’t be easy",
    "fullText": "Aprilia has admitted that it may be forced into early contract talks with Jorge Martin and Marco Bezzecchi, with rival teams “offering a lot of money” to lure its MotoGP riders away.\n\nWhile Aprilia’s improved competitiveness has made it an increasingly attractive destination within the paddock, the market value of Bezzecchi and Martin has also risen sharply in recent years, intensifying interest from other manufacturers.\n\nBezzecchi ended 2025 on a high with back-to-back victories in Portugal and Valencia, establishing himself as one of Marc Marquez’s closest challengers heading into the new season.\n\nMartin, meanwhile, had already attempted to activate a performance clause in his contract to leave Aprilia after 2025, with it widely believed that he had an offer to join Honda for this year.\n\nAprilia’s contracts with both riders expire at the end of 2026, in line with much of the MotoGP grid, which remains tied into the current two-year cycle.\n\nWith new technical regulations looming in 2027, the rider market is moving at a rapid pace, as teams seek to secure their line-ups before the start of the season.\n\nAprilia Racing CEO Massimo Rivola admitted he would prefer to delay decisions over his 2027 line-up, but acknowledged that growing interest from rival teams may leave him with little choice.\n\n“Honestly, I would prefer not to do it [sign riders] quickly, but maybe I am forced to do it quickly because the others are moving quite fast. I know that they are offering a lot of money to our riders,” Rivola said at Aprilia’s launch event.\n\n“But at the end, it is a commitment that we need to have altogether.\n\n“Clearly with Marco, we started building something that could allow me to see who he is.\n\n“With Jorge, we didn't start yet. I would love to see him 100% physically, and he is far from being that. He is a world champion. So it would be really nice to see him with us in the future. But first we need to give him his time.”\n\nLast year, Bezzecchi secured a factory contract for the first time in his career, as he joined Aprilia after three seasons at Ducati’s satellite VR46 team.\n\nWhile the Italian had already underlined his potential during a brilliant 2023 campaign in which he finished third in the standings, 2025 provided the clearest indication that he was ready for a championship assault with a factory.\n\nHe also emerged as Aprilia’s reference rider during the season, stepping into a leadership role after Martin missed much of the year due to a spate of injuries.\n\nAhead of the 2026 campaign, the 27-year-old said his priority is to secure the best possible package on the grid as he pursues his maiden title in grand prix racing.\n\nAsked whether winning or financial factors carried greater weight in his contract considerations, Bezzecchi said: “It always depends on who you are, it depends on what your priorities are.\n\n“Ultimately, if you want to earn a lot of money and you have people working with you to give you what you want, your manager and the people who work for you will do what's best for you.\n\n“If the best thing for you is to earn a lot of money, they'll do their best to make you earn a lot of money. If you want the best bike and you're willing to give up everything to try to have the best bike and to try to win, your manager must do what you want to try to make you feel better.\n\n“But it's clear that when you win anyway, you already earn well. I think that now, nowadays, all the riders in MotoGP are there to try to win, and so everyone tries to do their best.\n\n“Then, of course, if you're in a good moment and you take advantage of it, you earn even more, like in everything. But I don't think that's the focus. At least for me, personally, that's not the goal of my life.\n\n“Mine is to try to do the best I can with the bikes, to fight to win, also because if I win I'll also become rich. I'm even lucky twice over.”\n\nJorge Martin: Aprilia signed me to win the title, \"so I will fight till the end\"\n\nMax Biaggi: Aprilia 'not scared by any track' after late 2025 MotoGP charge\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "Paddy Pimblett has explained why his determination to fight Ilia Topuria soon is linked to Islam Makhachev.\n\nPaddy Pimblett’s rise through the UFC ranks has been steady, and his sights are now set on Ilia Topuria — not just to settle an old score, but because he sees it as a step toward a bigger goal.\n\nFor Pimblett, the path forward is shaped by the dominance of Islam Makhachev, a fighter he openly admires.\n\nIn a recent interview with The Mac Life, Paddy Pimblett was clear about who he sees as the sport’s top fighter, ahead of his bout with Justin Gaethje at UFC 324.\n\nHe praised Islam Makhachev’s dominance and consistency as the standard he aims to match in his own career.\n\n“For me, Islam is pound-for-pound No. 1. Ilia is No. 2. I want to beat Ilia and be on that pound-for-pound list. I want to show everyone why we have weight divisions and that he’s just too small to beat me.”\n\nThe Liverpool lightweight believes that beating Topuria would do more than just end their long-standing feud. It would also highlight the importance of weight classes in mixed martial arts, something he feels is often overlooked.\n\nPimblett’s recent comments show how much Makhachev’s reign has influenced his approach to the next stage of his career.\n\nPaddy Pimblett and Ilia Topuria’s rivalry began with a backstage confrontation at UFC London in 2022.\n\nSince then, both fighters have remained unbeaten in the UFC, and fans have been waiting for the matchup to finally take place.\n\nPimblett sees Topuria as the logical next step before facing higher-ranked opponents. He believes a victory would not only close a personal chapter but also mark his arrival among the elite — a journey that mirrors Makhachev’s rise to champion status.\n\nWith both men undefeated, anticipation continues to build for one of the UFC’s most heated potential matchups.\n\nFor Pimblett, though, it’s about more than rivalry — it’s about proving he can reach the level of the fighter he considers the sport’s best: Islam Makhachev.",

    "fullText": "The Miami Hurricanes have stormed their way to the College Football Playoff National Championship Game, riding a seven-game winning streak into a marquee matchup against the No. 1-ranked Indiana Hoosiers.\n\nBut with \"The U\" listed as nearly double-digit underdogs, they’ll need big performances from their playmakers to pull off the upset. With that in mind, here are my favorite Miami anytime touchdown picks for Monday, January 19.\n\nFor even more college football picks ahead of kickoff, check out my full Miami vs. Indiana predictions!\n\nMalachi Toney is one of the most electric players in this National Championship Game. While Indiana boasts an elite, disciplined defense, Toney has the game-breaking ability to make defenders miss and turn opportunities into scores.\n\nMiami has made a concerted effort to get its dynamic playmaker the ball in a variety of ways down the stretch. He’s been targeted 59 times, hauling in 45 catches, six for touchdowns, and has scored in five of his last six games.\n\nHurricanes tight end Elijah Lofton has already been ruled out for this game, so if Carson Beck needs a big-bodied security blanket, wideout CJ Daniels is the likely option.\n\nDaniels was one of Beck’s favorite targets earlier in the season, totaling 33 catches for 351 yards and six touchdowns over Miami’s first seven games.\n\nWhile Daniels hasn’t scored in the playoffs yet, he’s been targeted 16 times across three CFP games.\n\nAlthough Mark Fletcher Jr. is Miami’s lead running back, having CharMar Brown behind him makes the Hurricanes’ run game even more dangerous.\n\nBrown was last year’s FCS Freshman of the Year with National Champion North Dakota State, and the sophomore has earned Miami’s trust in key spots late in the season. Over his last five games, he’s totaled 37 carries for 150 yards and four touchdowns.\n\nIf “The U” needs to punch one in against a stout Indiana defense, Brown could get the call, making his +290 anytime TD odds enticing.\n\nMake your CFB National Championship Bets bets at FanDuel, America's No. 1 sportsbook! \n\nOdds are correct at the time of publishing and are subject to change.\nNot intended for use in MA.\nAffiliate Disclosure: Our team of experts has thoroughly researched and handpicked each product that appears on our website.

    "fullText": "The total on the College Football Playoff national championship may be as low as 47.5, but only a fool would think the Indiana Hoosiers will not score multiple touchdowns.\n\nAs brilliantly as the Miami Hurricanes’ defense has played in three Playoff games, some things are just inevitable.\n\nMy Indiana anytime touchdown picks focus on a couple of long shots for Monday, January 19.\n\nFor even more college football picks ahead of kickoff, check out our full Miami vs. Indiana predictions!\n\nIndiana’s WR1 Elijah Sarratt tweaked his hamstring at the start of November, causing him to miss three games and clearly limiting him for three more before breaking out in the Playoff semifinal.\n\nOne of those limited games came against Ohio State in the Big Ten title game, the nation’s best passing defense — an ugly 13-10 Hoosiers’ win. With Sarratt limited, Omar Cooper Jr. stepped up and has continued to contribute even after Sarratt returned.\n\nCooper has scored a touchdown in each of those six games.\n\nOf Fernando Mendoza’s six rushing touchdowns in six different games this season, only one came in a close contest, finding the end zone at Penn State in a 27-24 win.\n\nHowever, that rate alone justifies this bet: In Indiana’s three close games, Mendoza scored in one.\n\nThe real thought process here is simply an acknowledgement that there is no reason not to use every wrinkle possible in the national championship game.\n\nThere is a reason the “Philly Special” is used most often in massive games. These are the moments such plays are saved for.\n\nBut more likely, Mendoza carrying the ball near the goal line could help the Hoosiers mitigate Miami's defensive front.\n\nThis bet would have cashed on the first snap of the Playoff semifinal. Imagine that joy.\n\nIndiana has snagged 18 interceptions this season. As much as Miami quarterback Carson Beck could be the engine behind the Hurricanes winning the national championship, he could also propel the Hoosiers to the title.\n\nBeck threw four interceptions in a Friday game against Louisville back in October.

    "description": "The United Shore Professional Baseball League (USPBL), an independent league based in Michigan, is recruiting players in order to \"build the ability to pitch deep into games.\" Can it be done?",
    "fullText": "The independent minor leagues are baseball’s laboratories.\n\nPitch clocks? The robot umpires coming to the major leagues this year? The home run derby used to settle ties, as seen in last year’s All-Star Game? All first tested in an independent league.\n\nSome concepts are hits. Some are flops.\n\nThe experiment to watch this year is almost spiritual in nature: Can professional baseball make starting pitching great again?\n\nBaseball’s obsession with velocity has dampened the soul of the sport. The marquee pitching matchup is an endangered species. The oohs and aahs over a 100-mph pitch have been replaced by yawns.\n\nThe potential solution, or at least a piece of one, is evident in this job description:\n\nThe United Shore Professional Baseball League (USPBL), an independent league based in Michigan, is recruiting for the position of “primary starting pitcher.”\n\nThe game isn’t building traditional starters anymore. At the @uspbl, were changing that.\n\nWe are actively recruiting Primary Starting Pitchers who want to take the ball every week, pitch deep into games, and become the durable, innings-capable arms MLB organizations need.\n\nThis… pic.twitter.com/0JZvXEFsqW\n\n— Justin Orenduff (@JustinOrenduff) December 1, 2025\n\nThe language is intentional. In today’s major leagues, a starting pitcher generally is selected, trained and deployed to throw as hard as he can for as long as he can. Five innings is perfectly acceptable, with a parade of harder-throwing reinforcements in the bullpen.\n\nWhat the USPBL plans for a primary starting pitcher: “Build the ability to pitch deep into games.”\n\nThat used to be self-evident for a starting pitcher, but no longer. Yoshinobu Yamamoto turned into Sandy Koufax last October, with back-to-back complete games during the Dodgers’ championship run.\n\nHowever, in the regular season, the Dodgers did not throw a complete game, and neither did 12 other teams. The Dodgers’ starters averaged 4.85 innings per game; no team averaged even six innings.\n\nIn 2025, three major league pitchers threw 200 innings. In 2010, 45 did.\n\n“Being able to get more Mark Buehrles or Cliff Lees back into the fold would be good for the game,” said Justin Orenduff, a 2004 Dodgers first-round draft pick and now the USPBL executive director of baseball strategy and development.\n\nBuehrle, a five-time All-Star, and Lee, a four-time All-Star, each featured precision rather than power.\n\nLee, twice a Game 1 World Series starter, did not average 92 mph on his fastball but pitched 200 innings eight times. Buerhle, whose average fastball did not top 90 mph, pitched 200 innings for 14 consecutive years.\n\nNeither might be drafted today. Major league teams crave velocity, and young pitchers train to boost it. The number of players throwing at least 95 mph at the Perfect Game national showcase increased sevenfold from 2014 to 2024, according to a report from Major League Baseball.\n\nThe average MLB fastball rose from 91 mph in 2008 to 94 mph in 2024, the report said.\n\n“Velocity is the No. 1 predictor of success,” Billy Eppler, then the Angels’ general manager, told me in 2018.\n\nVelocity also is associated with an increased risk of injury. Teams have implemented well-intentioned measures — pitch counts, innings limits, more rest between appearances — that have not mitigated the risks and might well have led to more injuries.\n\nKyle Boddy, the founder of Driveline, the seminal program for velocity training, said a hard-throwing pitcher is not going to manage his velocity on an inflexible pitch count.\n\n“If he goes 60 or 70 pitches, he’s going to sit 100,” Boddy told Baseball America. “He’s not stupid. And if we tell him, ‘There’s no limits on you,’ but we keep taking him out after 70 pitches every time, he’s going to realize what’s going on.\n\n“If he can’t control the volume, the one lever he can control is the intensity. I personally think that’s worse for his arm, going max effort for shorter stints.”\n\nThat ultimately works against developing starting pitchers capable of delivering six innings, the MLB report said.\n\n“Modern workload management strategies — ostensibly intended to prevent overuse, protect pitcher health, and maximize pitcher effectiveness — may actually increase injury risk by allowing and even incentivizing pitchers to throw with maximum effort on every pitch,” the report said, “rather than requiring pitchers to conserve energy and pace themselves in an effort to pitch through longer outings.”\n\nNot only does throwing harder increase the risk of injury, the MLB report said, but the resulting parade of strikeouts runs “counter to contact-oriented approaches that create more balls in play and result in the type of on-field action that fans want to see.”\n\nIn the independent Atlantic League, the league has run several years of testing on a “double hook” rule: when a team removes its starting pitcher, it loses its designated hitter. That would incentivize a major league team to use its starter for six or seven innings instead of four or five, but it would not solve the underlying problem: What if the starting pitcher cannot work six or seven innings?\n\nThat is where Orenduff and the USPBL come in.\n\nEvery general manager says he would love a rotation of five 200-inning starters, if only he could find them. They cannot offer on-the-job training in the majors, lest their team find itself at a competitive disadvantage.\n\nIn an independent league, Orenduff need not worry about that. Tough matchup with the bases loaded in the fourth inning? Third time through the order in the sixth inning? Pitch through it.\n\n“It’s not going to be that quick pull,” he said.\n\nThis is not about leaving a starting pitcher out there to get crushed just to pitch through it. This is about shaking off the shackles of those one-size-fits-all limitations.\n\n“You basically want to start by showing fans and the industry, for example, that 100 pitches is just a number,” he said. “It’s completely arbitrary.\n\n“Some guys may be able to go 110, 120. We want to be able to show that the game can still produce players that are successful on the mound, most importantly, but are capable of going beyond the fifth inning and beyond 100 pitches if the expectation and the leadership and the structure are there to support it.”\n\nThe USPBL will have pretty much the same technology as major league teams do, to measure spin rates and recovery rates and every other rate. If you can maintain command and velocity, if you can get outs without max effort on every pitch, and if you can bounce back between innings and between starts, you may be able to be that primary starting pitcher.\n\nFrankly, Orenduff says, all the velocity in the world cannot help your team if you cannot pitch.\n\n“That has to be a metric too: sustainability and availability,” he said.\n\nHe conducted a study evaluating each team’s top three pitching draft picks since 2013. With the caveats that some pitchers were traded and some prospects still are developing, Orenduff found that three in four of those top drafted pitchers never have pitched for the major league team that drafted them, at a combined cost to the 30 MLB teams of $800 million in signing bonuses.\n\n“We just have to have some sort of proof we can help more players have longer careers by being a little more flexible in how we frame things for them,” Orenduff said.\n\nHere’s hoping the USPBL can discover some training methods that major league teams can use. Better that than listening to a major league manager with a 13-man pitching staff say after a game that he ran out of pitchers, as we too often hear. Can you imagine what Tommy Lasorda would have to say about that?\n\n Delivered at the start of each series.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

They should have relied more on speed, which would have allowed them to create more space to get shots off and be more dangerous,” said the Juventus boss via TuttoJuve.\n\n“Crosses can be an important weapon only if they’re delivered well. In some situations, we were also lucky, but we played our game. In matches like this, there’s always the risk of conceding counter-attacks, which in fact we rarely allowed. The difference was made by the ability to take advantage of chances, as Cagliari did. Evidently, today, it was meant to go that way.”\n\nJuventus dominated possession and arguably had the best chances to score at the Unipol Domus last night, but the home side managed a win with an xG of 0.16 compared to Juve’s 1.28.\n\nCAGLIARI, ITALY – JANUARY 17: Luciano Spalletti coach of Juventus reacts during the Serie A match between Cagliari Calcio and Juventus FC at Stadio Sant’Elia on January 17, 2026 in Cagliari, Italy.

Now we focus on the next match,” Spalletti added.\n\n“Surely, we must work on excessive time-wasting, which breaks up the flow of the game too much.”\n\nJuventus’ next game is at home against José Mourinho’s Benfica in the Champions League next Wednesday. Their following league game is also at home, against Antonio Conte’s Napoli on Sunday, January 25.\n\nSpalletti has won ten of his 16 matches in charge of Juventus, drawing four times and losing twice.",

    "fullText": "Lisandro Martinez has told Paul Scholes to come to his house and be honest with him if he wants to criticise him.\n\nThe World Cup winner hit back at the former Manchester United midfielders Scholes and Nicky Butt by accusing them of saying one thing to his face and another behind his back.\n\nMartinez excelled in Saturday’s Manchester derby win, keeping Erling Haaland, who is 20cm taller, quiet as United won 2-0 in Michael Carrick’s first game in charge.\n\nBut in the build-up, the 1999 Champions League winners spoke on a podcast when Butt said: “Haaland would pick Martinez up and run with him. It’ll be like you know when you see a dad after school running down the road with a little toddler.” Then Scholes replied: “He’d score, then throw him in the net.”\n\nBut Martinez feels they are guilty of double standards, saying: “I told him already, if he wants to say something to me, he can come to wherever he wants. To my house, wherever. I don't care.\n\n“And I respect the relations when they want to help the club because everyone can talk on the television but when you see [them] here face to face, no one says anything in your face. So for me, I don't really care what they say.”\n\nMartinez said he was not motivated by their comments, adding: “It doesn't give me anything. My motivation is my family.”\n\nBut the defender praised a third ex-United midfielder, in Carrick, for changing the mentality in the team after Ruben Amorim’s sacking.\n\n“So different, so different,” he added. “Different mentality, different guy. He knows what this club really means. He sent us the message that he played here for a long, long time. He won everything. He is a big legend. He wants to help the club and I think we were in a tough situation and today was the best moment to change that.”\n\nMartinez was paired in the middle of the defence with Harry Maguire as Carrick played a back four. They kept just United’s third clean sheet of the season and Martinez said the double act talked together to keep them organised.\n\n“I've known him for a long time and we speak a lot,” he said. “Today we had really good communication on the pitch but not just only with 'H'.”",

This will be their first final since 2004, when they lost to Tunisia when Regragui was part of the team.\n\nSenegal, meanwhile, are appearing in their third final in four editions and are targeting a second title to follow their 2022 triumph, when Mane scored the decisive shoot-out penalty against Egypt in Yaounde.\n\n\"We dreamt of being here and now we have done it,\" Regragui told reporters on Saturday.\n\nHe has been under suffocating pressure to deliver the title for the football-mad nation, and would possibly not have kept his job through to the approaching World Cup in North America had he not reached the final.\n\n\"I hope this is just the beginning and not our last AFCON final,\" he added.\n\n\"Big football nations want to be up there on a regular basis. Tomorrow we want to try to make history.\"\n\nHe added: \"Senegal will need to be really strong to beat us at home, although they are capable.\"\n\nMorocco's success over the last four weeks has been based around the attacking threat of Real Madrid winger Brahim Diaz, the tournament's top scorer with five goals, and a defence which has conceded only once.\n\nBeing at home brings extra pressure, but can also be a huge advantage, and Senegal have complained about the conditions in which they were welcomed to Rabat ahead of the game.\n\nThe Lions of Teranga were based in the northern port city of Tangiers until they arrived in Rabat by train on Friday.\n\nThe Senegalese Football Federation complained about a \"lack of adequate security\" for the team's arrival amid a crowd of fans \"which put the players and staff at risk\".\n\nIt also complained about their hotel, the fact that their supporters were given fewer than 3,000 tickets for the final, and about being asked to train at the Moroccan team's base in nearby Sale.\n\n\"What happened was not normal,\" said Senegal coach Pape Thiaw.\n\n\"Given the number there, anything could have happened. My players could have been in danger.\n\n\"That type of thing should not happen between two brother countries.\"\n\nMane, a two-time winner of the African player of the year award, said after netting the winner in the semi-final against Egypt that Sunday's game would be his last ever AFCON appearance.\n\nBut Thiaw insisted on the eve of the game that the former Liverpool forward may have to rethink that decision.\n\n\"I think he made his decision in the heat of the moment and the country does not agree, and I as coach of the national team do not agree,\" said Thiaw.\n\n\"We would like to keep him for as long as possible,\" added the coach, who is without centre-back and captain Kalidou Koulibaly due to suspension.\n\nOff the pitch this edition of Africa's premier sports event has demonstrated that Morocco is determined to be a successful co-host of the 2030 World Cup.\n\nThe tournament has been free of the problems that have plagued earlier AFCONs, the stadiums and pitches have generally been of a high quality and high-speed rail links show a country significantly upgrading its infrastructure.",

    "fullText": "Liverpool fans will no doubt be feeling a little frustrated.\n\nMarc Guehi was in the Premier League champions’ grasp just a few short months ago but now looks set to move to Manchester City.\n\nSporting director Richard Hughes agreed a fee for the Crystal Palace captain back on transfer deadline day. The Reds would pay an initial £35m for Guehi - whose contract at the FA Cup holders was due to expire in summer 2026.\n\nBut owing to a failure to land a replacement Palace pulled the plug with the 25-year-old defender instead staying put.\n\nMan City’s needs for a top-quality centre-back have increased in recent weeks - considering the injuries suffered by Ruben Dias, John Stones and above all Josko Gvardiol.\n\nShop the goalkeeper range today\n\nShop the third kit range today!\n\nThat meant Pep Guardiola brought forward a deal for Guehi - who was set to become a high-profile free agent next summer. The England defender will now join City on a bumper contract for a fee of around £20m - leaving Liverpool empty-handed.\n\nPlans will now need to be made for an alternative defender to come to Anfield - and it’s unlikely to happen in January. But next summer the picture will change and the Merseysiders will need to recruit a solid, senior option in the position.\n\nAnd according to a report in TEAMtalk one Liverpool target Alessandro Bastoni is willing to move.\n\nThe Inter Milan defender, 26, is under contract at San Siro until 2028 and it’s speculated that a fee of around £70m would be required to sign the Italy international.\n\n“Alessandro Bastoni is very much open to a transfer this year,” the report reads.\n\nIt looks like Chelsea will also be in the market for Bastoni - a left-footed centre-back who can also play in a back three. Other players reported to be under consideration for a Liverpool role include Nico Schlotterbeck and Nathan Collins.\n\nBastoni has won two Serie A titles for the Nerazzurri since debuting in the 2019/20 season and has also helped his side reach two Champions League final. He was also a member of the Italy squad which won the 2020 UEFA European Championship at Wembley.",

    "description": "As highlighted Friday in the New York Post, the proposed wealth tax would hit founders on their voting shares rather than the actual equity they own.",
    "fullText": "If you’ve been following the billionaire exodus from California with some confusion, here’s what’s actually driving the nervousness: it’s not the 5% rate. As highlighted Friday in the New York Post, the proposed wealth tax would hit founders on their voting shares rather than the actual equity they own.\n\nTake Larry Page, who about 3% of Google but controls roughly 30% of its voting power through dual-class stock. Under this proposal, he’d owe taxes on that 30%. For a company valued in the hundreds of billions, that’s a lot more than a rounding error. The Post reports that one SpaceX alumni founder building grid technology would face a tax bill at the Series B stage of the company that would wipe out his entire holdings.\n\nDavid Gamage, the University of Missouri law professor who helped craft the proposal, thinks Silicon Valley is overreacting. “I don’t understand why the billionaires just aren’t calling good tax lawyers,” he told The San Francisco Standard this week. Gamage insists founders wouldn’t be forced to sell. Those with most of their wealth in private stock could open a deferral account for assets they don’t want taxed immediately — California would instead take 5% whenever those shares are eventually sold. “If your startup fails, you pay nothing,” he explained. “But if your startup is the next Google, you’re giving California a share of your gamble.” He also said founders could submit alternative valuations from certified appraisers reflecting what shares could actually sell for, rather than being stuck with the default voting-control formula.\n\nBut that’s pretty small consolation. For startups that aren’t publicly traded, calculating valuations is “inherently difficult,” tax expert Jared Walczak told the Post. “These are not clear cut—you could come to a very different conclusion not because of dishonesty.” And if the state disagrees with your appraisal, it’s not just the company on the hook; the state can also penalize the person who calculated the valuation. Even with alternative appraisals, founders would still face enormous tax bills on control they hold but wealth they haven’t realized.\n\nNow, if you’ve been under a rock: California’s health care union is pushing a ballot initiative for a one-time 5% tax on anyone worth over $1 billion. The union argues it’s necessary to offset the deep cuts to health care that President Trump signed into law last year, including slashes to Medicaid and ACA subsidies. As originally envisioned, they expect to raise about $100 billion from roughly 200 individuals and the tax would apply retroactively to anyone living in California as of January 1, 2026.\n\nBut the resistance is fierce and bipartisan. As reported last weekend by the WSJ, Silicon Valley elite have formed a Signal chat called “Save California” that includes everyone from Trump’s crypto czar David Sacks to Kamala Harris mega-donor Chris Larsen. They’ve called the proposal “Communism” and “poorly defined.” Some are taking just-in-case measures, too, with Larry Page reportedly dropping $173.4 million on two Miami waterfront properties across last month and the first week of the new year, and Peter Thiel’s firm leasing Miami office space last month. (Thiel has had ties to Miami for years — including a home — but an uncharacteristic press release about the move was seemingly meant to send a message.)\n\nEven Governor Gavin Newsom is fighting it. “This will be defeated, there’s no question in my mind,” he told the New York Times this week, adding that he’d been “relentlessly working behind the scenes” against the proposal. “I’ll do what I have to do to protect the state.”\n\nFor now, the union isn’t backing down. “We’re simply trying to keep emergency rooms open and save patient lives,” said executive committee member Debru Carthan to the Journal last weekend. “The few who left have shown the world just how outrageously greedy they truly are.”\n\nThe proposal needs 875,000 signatures to make November’s ballot, where it would need a simple majority to pass.",

Ads will be clearly labeled and separated from the organic answer. You’ll be able to learn more about why you’re seeing that ad, or dismiss any ad and tell us why. During our test, we will not show ads in accounts where the user tells us or we predict that they are under 18, and ads are not eligible to appear near sensitive or regulated topics like health, mental health or politics.\n\nFurthermore, OpenAI says that your conversations with ChatGPT are not shared with advertisers. Ads also will not influence answers that ChatGPT gives you.\n\nOpenAI says that it’s “not launching ads yet,” but rather plans to “start testing in the coming weeks for logged in adults in the U.S. on the free and Go tiers.”\n\nWhat do you think of today’s announcements from OpenAI?

    "fullText": "UK gas prices don't form in isolation - they're the result of a global system where LNG tankers move molecules across oceans, storage facilities buffer seasonal demand swings, and physical constraints create friction that simple supply-demand models miss.\n\nThis guide explains the infrastructure and economics that connect US shale production to UK power plants. You'll learn how LNG shipping works, why UK gas prices track Henry Hub (Louisiana) with a 6-8 week lag, and how traders calculate netback prices to decide whether exporting US gas to Europe is profitable. You'll see why LNG is the flexible marginal source while Norwegian pipelines provide inflexible baseload, and how charter rate volatility (which spiked 5x in 2025) can turn a profitable cargo into a loss overnight.\n\nThe guide also covers the UK's structural vulnerability: storage capacity below 2% of annual demand (versus 20% in continental Europe). You'll understand why this makes UK prices volatile, how storage arbitrage works (and why most seasonal spreads don't cover storage costs), and why NBP can decouple from TTF despite physical interconnection - a basis risk that's burned countless traders who assumed prices would converge.\n\nYou'll work through real calculations: shipping costs for Atlantic crossings, netback comparisons between European and Asian markets, and storage break-even analysis using German salt caverns. By the end, you'll see how global gas dynamics feed directly into the spark spread formulas you'll learn next.\n\nPhysical Foundations taught you why gas plants set marginal power prices. This guide shows you where gas prices come from - the global infrastructure that determines the fuel input cost. Next, you'll learn spark spreads (power minus gas minus carbon), which combine gas prices with power and carbon markets to identify profitable generation opportunities.\n\nComplete the Physical Foundations guide first. You need to understand merit order dispatch and why gas-fired plants are marginal price-setters. No prior trading experience required.\n\nTrack Henry Hub and NBP prices online or on TradingView for a month. When Henry Hub makes a significant move, set a calendar reminder for 6-8 weeks and check whether NBP followed.

    "description": "Local print media is in a death spiral. Nonprofit journalism start-ups show how journalists can still do essential work.",
    "fullText": "The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, one of America’s oldest newspapers, announced this month that it would cease publication. The family-owned company that operates the paper made the announcement after a court ruled against it in a dispute with unionized workers. Pittsburgh is hardly alone. Since 2005, more than 3,500 newspapers have shuttered. On average, two close every week.\n\nThe consequences of the collapse of the local newspaper business have been severe. When communities lose their local news outlets, civic engagement drops, corruption rises, government waste increases and political polarization worsens. Communities no longer know themselves. No number of headlines about goings-on in Washington can change that.\n\nBut the death of The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette does not mean that Pittsburghers must go without local news. While the market failure of the newspaper business has been well documented, what is less known is how communities all over the country have responded to this crisis.\n\nHundreds of nonprofit local news organizations have sprung up, from Lafayette, La., to New Bedford, Mass., to Chicago. Rather than relying primarily on advertising revenue, nonprofit newsrooms are sustained by coalitions of philanthropic institutions, local businesses, individual donors and readers. Under this model, local journalism is treated as a public good, essential to civic life, akin to a museum or a food bank.\n\nMany of these nonprofits started within the past decade. They operate where audiences can be most easily found today: online and in email inboxes. There’s less focus on print and newsstands. This new generation of local nonprofit outlets — some of which are supported by the American Journalism Project, where I work — has already distinguished itself with journalism of the highest quality. In the past three years, the Pulitzer Prize for local reporting has been awarded entirely or jointly to a nonprofit newsroom that did not exist even a decade prior.\n\nThe excellent reporting by nonprofits includes the Pulitzer-winning work of Mississippi Today, founded in 2016, which exposed tens of millions of dollars in misused Mississippi state welfare money. The Indiana-based Mirror Indy uncovered systemic abuse at a mental health facility in Lawrence, Ind. In the run-up to the 2025 election, the Boyle Heights Beat in East Los Angeles reported a shortage of in-person polling centers; officials solved the problem as a result. The City, a nonprofit based in New York City, revealed allegedly corrupt practices within then-Mayor Eric Adams’s administration after a senior adviser attempted to give cash, memorably concealed in a bag of chips, to a reporter.\n\nThe success of these newsrooms suggests the problem facing local news is not a lack of public appetite but an outdated business model. The new approach is rapidly growing: The number of local nonprofit news outlets more than doubled from 2017 to 2022, according to the Institute for Nonprofit News. In Vermont, VTDigger boasts a monthly audience of 500,000 in a state with just over 600,000 people and now has an operating budget of $3 million, supported by reader donations, advertising and individual and institutional philanthropy alike. The Baltimore Banner brought in more than $13 million in revenue in 2024, with about half from subscriptions, a third from advertising and a fifth from donations.\n\nMany work with established media companies in partnerships that allow online-only nonprofit newsrooms to distribute some of their work in legacy newspapers. And some legacy newspapers, like The Salt Lake Tribune, have become nonprofits.\n\nThe value of independent local journalism is acknowledged across our deep partisan divide. Last year, both Republican and Democratic state lawmakers cited The Texas Tribune in the documentation and analysis behind 25 separate bills. After a recent Texas state legislative election, two competing candidates jointly voiced support for another nonprofit, The Fort Worth Report, writing, “While we disagree on many issues, we agree on this.”\n\nThus far, nonprofit start-ups have not expanded nearly enough to replace the full depth of coverage that vanishes when a newspaper closes. Some, like The Houston Landing, have also closed. Members of the Institute for Nonprofit News now employ over 3,000 journalists, well below the 45,000 reporting and editing jobs lost at newspapers since 2005. These gaps are not abstractions: Reporters are eyes and ears at school board meetings, city halls and statehouses, probing for wrongdoing and holding the powerful to account. The concrete value of that work does not go unnoticed; even today, Americans continue to express far higher levels of trust in local news reporting than in national media.\n\nThe collapse of the newspaper industry unfolded over decades. Rebuilding local journalism will take time, money and community support.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, there are particular reasons for optimism. The city has a robust philanthropic community with a track record of investing in institutions that anchor public life. The city has world-class museums, universities, libraries and hospitals. As The Post-Gazette has shrunk, nonprofits like Spotlight PA, Pittsburgh’s Public Source and the public radio station WESA have stepped in, as has the city’s other daily paper, The Tribune-Review. A chapter of the news-focused philanthropy group Press Forward was recently founded in the city, indicating recognition that the city has the ingredients needed to ensure local journalism still thrives.\n\nThe end of a venerable newspaper is disheartening. But it does not have to mean the end of local journalism — in Pittsburgh or anywhere else.\n\nSarabeth Berman is the chief executive of the American Journalism Project.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

    "fullText": "If you follow me, you might already know Tech Workers Coalition (TWC). For everybody else, TWC is an international organization that supports union and political organizing of workers within the tech sector. It's heavily decentralized and has chapters spread throughout North America and Europe. It includes every kind of profession in the field: developers, content moderators, designers, testers, sysadmins, data workers, customer service, and so on.\n\nThe organization, over the years, tried different paths to communicate to the outside what it does, why it does what it does, and what it would like to do in the future. The most recent iteration is probably this Identity Document, which gets regularly printed into flyers and handed to newcomers during onboarding sessions.\n\nThe challenge comes from different factors:\n\nI've been part of TWC for 7 years now. I helped start the Berlin chapter, then the Italian chapter, and in the last two years, the Global chapter. I've talked with hundreds of people participating in the communities, coached many chapter organizers, given workshops and onboarding sessions, and facilitated hundreds of meetings within TWC. It is now an integral part of my present and my past.\n\nIn this article, I want to give my take on why I do this, why I think it's important, and why some of you might want to join us. Because, ultimately, it is not so obvious and linear why somebody should be contributing their time to TWC rather than, for example, a union.\n\nLet me preface by saying that I strongly believe that any healthy political ecosystem is composed of organizations aware of their own role. Constructive relationships are also built by behaving in a way that fosters the success of your peers and the health of the whole ecology, rather than by exclusively pursuing the success of your own ideas, your own model, and your own issues. In the context of political participation and activation, this often translates into growing the organization with just the right people, rather than growing indefinitely. Trying to incorporate everybody and preventing them from joining organizations with slightly different values or goals turns political engagement into a zero-sum game. That means that we often invite workers NOT to join TWC if it's not the right thing for them, and rather do direct workplace organizing, join a union, or a party.\n\nThis article, then, while advocating for the merit and worth of participating in TWC, should be seen primarily as a useful tool to decide if you might be a good fit for TWC or if you should rather join a different space.\n\nSo, why Tech Workers Coalition? Why should you join? And how would your effort translate into impact?\n\nOne of the most recognized contributions of TWC has always been its ability to complement unions at the local level. Often stuck in a Fordist mindset, unions struggle to grasp the implications of cognitive labor and its specificities, worsening the gap of language, culture, and aesthetics between unions and office workers in the tech sector.\n\nThis doesn't happen magically: TWC organizers create offline and online community spaces, conferences, and events for green and experienced tech organizers to connect. They develop relationships with unions and link them to workplaces that are interested in organizing. They translate in both directions and facilitate interactions. They offer educational activities specific to labor organizing in the tech sector that unions overlook.\n\nUnions are often big organizations, slow to adapt and transform. Cognitive work poses deep challenges that are still unsolved at a global strategic level. TWC allows tech unions to still develop and thrive on the ground by filling the gaps in the areas traditional unions cannot yet see.\n\nThe more we go on, the more we realize how the tech elites, especially in the USA, are openly supporting a return to Fascism and other forms of oppression. They are reshaping the global economy to entrench themselves in the productive processes and state machinery. They imprint their values and beliefs on the psychic landscape of the ever-increasingly alienated modern and post-modern worlds.\n\nMany are fighting the tech oligarchs from without: hackers and FOSS communities, environmental activists, NGOs, and sometimes even governments. The truth is, though, that the real leverage is between the office chair and the keyboard. We could talk extensively about economics, infrastructure, power analysis, and even draw historical comparisons with the organizing of early factory workers, when only a few, like Marx, were advocating for focusing on them rather than organizing farmers, like most socialists were doing. It would be a long and boring analysis. Suffice to say that there's a lot of power in the tech industry, and that's a lot of power that could be contested and won by tech workers. We are uniquely positioned to bind such power enough to, at the very least, limit the harm the tech industry is doing to the rest of the world or, in the best scenario, reshape how and why technology is produced.\n\nWhat if you believe this, but you don't work in tech? Well, join TWC anyway. Workplace organizing is not possible for everybody: geography, workplace conditions, or, as I said, a different career path might prevent you from doing “the Thing”. TWC is a space where you can help others do “the Thing”. It's meta-organizing, baby. For some, it is frustrating: they want to be directly involved, they want the tension of a high-stakes union election, or the thrill and risk of a direct action during a protest. For others, it is cozy and reassuring: you help a hundred plants grow, and some of them for sure will bear fruit.\n\nThe tech labor movement is, worldwide, a relatively young phenomenon. In some countries, it's unheard of. In some others, it is growing and exploring what's possible. While we are beginning to understand what works and what doesn't, nobody really has found a magic formula that solves it all. Contrary to other forms of labor organizing, where ideas decades old are crystallized and organizations struggle to keep up with social and political changes, in the tech sector there's a lot of experimentation going on.\n\nOn one side it is stressful for many: some workers just want to improve their workplace and would like to have a cookiecutter strategy to apply. On the other side, for the more creative and ambitious, there's a lot of room to try new approaches. For example, we are still not set on what a strike in tech looks like. Some workers just stop working. Some employ traditional forms like picketing or marching instead of going to the office. Some others do more fun and creative stuff to keep busy and attract attention: live streaming, union-themed game jams and hackathons, and so on and so forth.\n\nTWC acts as a network throuch which these ideas travel. Traditional media or social media don't always cover these topics, especially outside the USA. Established networks of unions often talk high-level strategy and rarely go into such level of detail. TWC instead often sees meetings with tech workers from all over, sharing their stories and circulating know-how they didn't know they had. In a way, being in TWC feels like the early internet: tech labor is fragmented and disconnected across national boundaries, and absent from traditional media. TWC acts as a network for the first time, allowing tech workers to discover that in Czechia, India, or the Philippines, there are people like them, with similar issues, but maybe completely different approaches, ideas, and aesthetics.\n\nAs we said, the fight against Big Tech takes many shapes. TWC doesn't collaborate only with labor organizations, but, especially at a local level, acts as an aggregator for people working professionally on the political side of technology: researchers, investigators, artists, occultists, cooperative entrepreneurs, sometimes even party politicians.\n\nThis means that many members of TWC get involved in a lot of different and interesting initiatives happening at the fringes of our network: experimental commoning of technology, litigations, hackatons, policy-making, campaigns, performances, exhibitions, and so on.\n\nIn many places, especially smaller cities, TWC becomes a beacon for anybody working with radical technology but dissatisfied with the more traditional aggregation around hackerspaces or technical communities.\n\nFor some of us, this turned into a whole new career. Workplace organizing is fundamental, but after you're done, after you have your union in place, the company will probably still be working on how to feed the souls of innocent babies into a spirit-grinding, high-performance, demonic contraption. It takes a long time before the union is strong enough to push the company away from the business of butchering baby souls and towards more useful endeavors.\n\nThere are many cases of members that, after several years of TWC, decide to abandon their career in the tech startup or corporate world and go do something different. Some get employed by unions. Some start their own cooperative with their friends. Others join TWC meetings after waking up early to work on a farm. Some go teach in a movement school or join an NGO. Personally, participating in TWC allowed me to connect with people who eventually got me involved into AI Forensics first, and Reversing.works later. The full story here.\n\nI hope this article gave a compelling overview of what I helped build through a whole fifth of my life and I will keep building going forward. A journey that thought me agency, compassion, patience, dedication, and especially the ecstactic joy of seeing the world and the life of people around you change and get better over time.\n\nIf you're tired of arguing on the internet, if you think there's nothing to be done to form a union at work, if you're forced to “monitor the situation”, join TWC.",

    "description": "Building a TUI to index and search coding agent sessions across Claude Code, Codex, and others, with Tantivy for fuzzy full-text search.",
    "fullText": "This is the story of how fast-resume came to life and evolved, as I was trying to search and resume my coding agent sessions more easily across different local CLI agents.\n\nI use many coding agents these days: Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Copilot, and more. Sometimes I remember that I, or the agent, mentioned something specific in a previous session, and I want to go back to it.\n\nMost coding agents have a /resume feature now, which allows a session to be reopened with all the state back. While the resume feature works great, finding which session to resume is harder.\n\nThat means that for example if I remember the agent mentioning a specific subject later during the conversation, it won’t be in the title, so I can’t find it.\n\nLet’s say I have a few sessions about building a TUI program. I remember that in one of the sessions, the agent mentioned textual. I can’t search for textual in the resume view! Also, if I don’t remember the folder and which agent I used, I’m screwed. And some agents don’t have that feature at all.\n\nSo I started ripgrep‘ing my home folder to find the string I was searching for, then using clues from the session file (directory, timestamp, context) to navigate to the correct directory, /resume, and find the session in question. 😅\n\nSince most coding agents store sessions locally, I started thinking: what if I could automate this grep‘ing, wrap it in a nice TUI and be able to resume in one keypress?\n\nFirst, to see if this was feasible, I had to understand how sessions are actually stored. Most agents use JSON files, but there are some interesting differences.\n\nMost agents follow the same pattern as Claude Code: Codex and Copilot CLI use JSONL with similar structures.\n\nFiles are stored in ~/.claude/projects/{project_id}/{session_id}.jsonl. JSONL is a format where each JSON object is stored independently on a newline.\n\nMessages from the user or Claude and tool calls are stored that way. Here is an example of a message:\n\nOpenCode doesn’t use JSONL but instead independent JSON files. Message content is sharded by session id, message id, and message parts in ~/.local/share/opencode/storage/:\n\nThis design conceptually makes sense: not having to rewrite or append to a single file might be simpler. But for indexing, it means a lot more filesystem operations. To give you an idea: I used Claude Code possibly 100x more than OpenCode, yet OpenCode has 10x more files (9,847 vs 827). See Stats \n\nVibe stores one JSON file per session in ~/.vibe/logs/session/session_*.json. It is not JSONL. The file contains metadata and the full messages array.\n\nOne detail that surprised me: Vibe rewrites the entire file after each user turn. That means the file grows and gets fully serialized on every message, which is simple but doesn’t seem very efficient for long sessions.\n\nCrush is the only agent that uses SQLite instead of JSON files. Projects are listed in ~/.local/share/crush/projects.json, and each project has its own .crush/crush.db database.\n\nThe schema has a sessions table with metadata like title, message count, and cost, and a messages table with role and parts (stored as JSON).\n\nI’m surprised it’s the only agent using SQLite!\n\nTo search sessions, I started with a naive approach. I defined a common Session type and an adapter protocol to abstract each agent’s storage format:\n\nEach adapter implements three methods: find_sessions parses all session files and returns Session objects, get_resume_command returns the shell command to resume a session (claude --resume {id} for Claude, codex resume {id} for Codex), and is_available checks if the agent’s data directory exists.\n\nFor example, here’s the core of Claude’s adapter:\n\nAdding a new agent means writing one adapter file. Implement scanning, parsing, and the resume command. The search engine, TUI, and CLI all work automatically.\n\nOn startup, each adapter would parse its session files and return a list of Session objects. I cached the results in a sessions.json file and used file mtimes to know when to reindex.\n\nFor search, I used RapidFuzz because the experience I had in mind was the familiar fuzzy finding of fzf. For each session, I built a searchable string by concatenating the title, directory, and full content:\n\nRapidFuzz’s Weighted Ratio scorer compared the query against every searchable string. This scorer has an interesting backstory but it basically uses other scorers based on the lengths of the string.\n\nThe problem was that WRatio alone didn’t rank exact matches high enough. Searching for “fix auth bug” might rank “authentication fixes” higher than a session literally titled “fix auth bug”. I added bonuses on top of the fuzzy score: +25 if the query appears as a substring, +15 if all query words are present, and +30 if they appear consecutively. This helped with ranking quality, but the performance was not good enough for me. Every search scanned every session on every keystroke. The TUI would visibly lag while typing, and I’m trying to have a very reactive TUI.\n\nI needed a proper search engine. I first considered SQLite FTS5, which has a trigram tokenizer for similarity matching, but it works by comparing 3-character substring overlap rather than edit distance, which is what I’m looking for. I’m a very imprecise typer 😄\n\nI opted for Tantivy, an in-process full-text search library written in Rust, and the one powering Quickwit. Instead of comparing the query against every document at search time, we can use it to build an inverted index upfront: a mapping from terms to the sessions that contain them.\n\nTantivy’s FuzzyTermQuery uses Levenshtein distance, which is better for actual typos: “teh” matches “the” (distance=1), but wouldn’t match with trigrams since they share no 3-character chunks.\n\nWhen a session gets indexed, Tantivy tokenizes its content into terms and stores which document IDs contain each term. Searching for “auth bug” means finding documents containing “auth”, finding documents containing “bug”, intersecting the sets, then scoring the matches using BM25.\n\nLuckily, the only “official” bindings for Tantivy are for Python! So I was able to use it directly and very easily in my project.\n\nThe schema defines what gets indexed:\n\nText fields get tokenized and indexed for search. The raw tokenizer keeps the value as-is without splitting, which is useful for IDs and agent names where “copilot-cli” should stay as one token, not become “copilot” and “cli”. (cf Keyword query syntax)\n\nWhen the schema changes (adding a field, changing tokenizers), the index needs to be rebuilt. I track a schema version in a file alongside the index and clear everything if it doesn’t match:\n\nIt’s not very robust (I could bump the version to the same number into two concurrent PRs), but it’s good enough for now.\n\nFor fuzzy matching, Tantivy supports custom distance for queries. A fuzzy term query with distance 1 matches terms that are one character insertion, deletion, or substitution away from the query term. “atuh” matches “auth”, “bugg” matches “bug”.\n\nThe prefix=True flag also matches terms that start with the query, so “au” matches “auth” and “authentication”.\n\nI ran into the same ranking problem as with RapidFuzz: fuzzy matches sometimes outranked exact matches. The fix was a hybrid query that boosts exact matches:\n\nThe performance has been quite good with Tantivy. My use case is pretty basic and the dataset is very small in FTS terms, so I haven’t looked into performance optimization too much. But queries complete in a handful of milliseconds, which is perfect!\n\nThe first version of fast-resume rebuilt the entire index when any source directory changed. Adding one new Claude session meant re-parsing hundreds of Codex sessions that hadn’t changed.\n\nThe fix was tracking modification times per session. Tantivy stores each session’s mtime alongside its content:\n\nOn startup, fast-resume asks the index for all known sessions and their mtimes. Each adapter compares file mtimes against what’s known and only re-parses what changed or is new:\n\nIf a session’s mtime is newer than what’s in the index, re-parse it. If a session exists in the index but not on disk, mark it deleted. Everything else stays untouched.\n\nUpdates are atomic: delete the old documents and add the new ones in a single transaction before committing. This avoids a window where the session is missing from the index:\n\nIf nothing changed (the common case) the whole process is just reading mtimes and comparing numbers. In any case, this happens in the background while the TUI starts instantly (see streaming updates).\n\nMost adapters spend their time parsing JSON. Claude sessions are JSONL files with hundreds of lines. OpenCode has thousands of small JSON files spread across directories. Even with incremental indexing, the initial index build parses everything.\n\nTo try to gain a bit for performance, I switched the native json lib for orjson, which is a JSON library written in Rust that’s supposed to be a lot faster.\n\norjson’s loads also accept both strings and bytes, and it’s faster with bytes, so we can pass it the file directly in binary mode without converting to a string first.\n\nThe TUI is built with Textual, a Python framework for terminal interfaces. I discovered it with Mistral’s vibe coding agent. This and uv are the reason I wanted this project to be Python, even though I usually pick Go for CLIs.\n\nTextual provides a layout system, widgets, reactive state, and async workers, great to have a fully featured and snappy TUI.\n\nThe main screen has three parts: a search input at the top, a results table in the middle, and a preview pane at the bottom. Everything is reactive; changing state automatically updates the UI, which is a pattern I like and I’m used to with web frameworks.\n\nOn startup, results load instantly from the existing index. In parallel, all adapters compare file mtimes to find new or modified sessions and index them in the background. Each time an adapter finishes, the results table refreshes to include the newly indexed sessions. On first run or after a schema version bump, the index is empty so results populate progressively as adapters complete.\n\nThe TUI runs this off the main thread using Textual’s @work decorator. Each time an adapter finishes indexing, on_progress re-runs the current search query against the updated index, so newly indexed sessions that match appear immediately:\n\ncall_from_thread marshals updates back to the main thread for UI changes.\n\nSearch is debounced to improve responsiveness when holding delete for example, otherwise the TUI doesn’t have enough time to re-render after the search and it feels laggy.\n\nThe watch_search_query method is a Textual watcher: it gets called automatically when search_query changes. Setting the reactive variable triggers the search.\n\nSearch also runs in a background thread so the UI stays responsive while Tantivy works:\n\nThe query time gets displayed next to the search box, it’s surprisingly variable, from ~0.5ms to ~50ms on my laptop. But it feels pretty snappy!\n\nNavigation works with up/down, but also j and k. shift+tab to move from search to preview, / to focus back the search bar, return resumes the selected session. Scrolling also works with the mouse. You can resize the preview with + and - or hide it entirely with Ctrl+backtick.\n\nSearch terms are highlighted in the results table (title, directory) in fzf style and the preview pane using Rich’s Text.stylize(). One limitation: Tantivy returns matching documents but doesn’t expose which terms actually matched. So if you search “atuh” and it fuzzy-matches “auth”, only “atuh” gets highlighted, not “auth”. I couldn’t find a way to get the expanded terms from Tantivy.\n\nSince modern terminals support inline images through protocols like Sixel, I thought we could include coding agent logos to make it look nicer. The textual-image library handles terminal detection and rendering. Unfortunately, it doesn’t work with vhs, so I have to record demos manually!\n\nSession timestamps are colored based on age: green for recent, fading through yellow and orange to gray for old. Exponential decay maps time to a 0-1 value, which compresses older sessions together:\n\nThen t interpolates through color stops (green → yellow → orange → gray). A session from an hour ago looks noticeably different from one from yesterday, but three months and six months both just look “old”.\n\nPlain text search works fine for most queries, but sometimes you want to narrow results by agent or time. Rather than building a separate filter UI, I added keyword syntax directly in the search box. Type agent:claude to filter to Claude sessions, date:today for today’s sessions, dir:my-project to match directory paths.\n\nTextual’s Suggester provides autocomplete as you type: agent:cl suggests claude, date:to suggests today. It also handles negation, so agent:!co suggests !codex.\n\nThe parser extracts keywords from the query using a regex, handling keyword:value pairs, quoted values with spaces like dir:\"my project\", and negation with - or !. Whatever doesn’t match a keyword becomes free-text that goes to Tantivy.\n\nAgent and directory filters support multiple values: agent:claude,codex matches either agent, agent:claude,!codex means Claude but not Codex. Date filters have their own mini-language: date:today, date:yesterday, date:<1h (within the last hour), date:>2d (older than two days).\n\nThese parsed filters translate to Tantivy queries:\n\nWhen you press Enter on a session, the TUI doesn’t directly exec the resume command. Instead it stores the command and directory, exits cleanly, and returns them to the CLI wrapper:\n\nThe CLI then uses os.execvp to replace itself with the agent’s resume command:\n\nexecvp replaces the current process entirely: same PID, same terminal, but now running Claude or Codex instead of fast-resume. This is cleaner than spawning a child process because the resumed agent owns the terminal directly. Ctrl+C goes to the agent, not to a wrapper script.\n\nThe directory change happens first because most agents expect to be run from the project directory.\n\nSome agents support “yolo mode” to automatically approve edits and tool calls. Claude has --dangerously-skip-permissions for example. But it applies to the current instance of claude, not the session. So starting claude without this flag, you can’t resume a past session in yolo mode, even if that session was started in an instance of claude started with the flag.\nWhen you resume a session, fast-resume can detect if it was originally started in yolo mode and offer to resume the same way.\n\nAdapters that parse session files look for yolo indicators. Codex stores approval policy in a turn_context record:\n\nVibe stores it directly in session metadata:\n\nThe yolo flag gets indexed alongside each session. When you resume, the TUI checks in order: fast-resume’s --yolo flag overrides everything, then stored session yolo state, then if the adapter supports yolo but we don’t know the session’s state, a modal asks the user.\n\nSince we’re indexing all sessions across agents, we get analytics as a bonus. fr --stats gives you a breakdown of your session history:\n\nThis was a fun project! It was a good occasion to try a new framework for TUIs and use an in-process search engine to keep things snappy. I’m pretty happy with the result!\n\nI published it to PyPI, so you can try or install it with uv:",

    "fullText": "A woman said she was sent home from her local emergency room after complaining about pain, only to later require surgery for bone spurs in her spine\n\n“I feel like now, because I wasn’t essential, and they didn’t act quick enough, that I’ve been left with permanent nerve damage and constant cramps every single night,” Amanda Young told a local news outlet\n\nA spokesperson for the hospital hit back at Young’s claims, however, stating her case was “thoroughly reviewed” and she received appropriate care at the time\n\nA woman said she was sent home from her local emergency room in pain — only to later require surgery for bone spurs in her spine.\n\nAmanda Young of Queensland, Australia, called an ambulance in 2023 due to escalating back pain and was taken to the Townsville University Hospital, where she said she received pain medication and was sent home shortly after, local outlet 7 News reported.\n\nFour hours later, Young told 7 News she returned to the hospital screaming in agony. There, she claimed she was met with opposition from the medical facility's staff, explaining, \"I was told by the doctor there to ‘shut up,’ [but] due to my symptoms and me being in pain, I couldn’t control it.\"\n\n“I was told they’ve already done everything that they can for me, that my medication was appropriate, that they’ve upped the doses of a nerve blocker that was already not working, which is why I ended up back in the hospital,\" Young added to the outlet.\n\nYoung told 7 News she eventually ended up being placed in a bed in the hospital following her pleas.\n\n“I couldn’t even get up and go to the bathroom. I begged them for a bedpan. They wouldn’t even give me a bedpan,\" she claimed to the outlet. \"I was forced to go off the side of the bed. It was very embarrassing.\"\n\nYoung also claimed to 7 News that when she requested more medication to help ease her immediate pain, she felt she was treated like a “drug seeker.”\n\n“I was told there was nothing wrong with me,” she said to the outlet.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nAccording to Young, she was eventually sent home in a taxi. She said she \"crawled” to her front door and into bed.\n\nThe next day, Young told 7 News she returned to the hospital and invoked Ryan’s Rule, which enables patients in Queensland to initiate an urgent review of their care if they believe treatment has not been appropriately escalated. (The rule is named for Ryan Saunders, a teenager who died in 2007 after he failed to receive appropriate medical care.)\n\nYoung said she was then taken to the hospital's surgery department for a consultation.\n\n“They medicated me straight away, gave me appropriate medication to settle down my symptoms. I was told that he did believe me and that they would eventually operate on me, but they weren’t going to talk about it at that point in time because of the pain and what I’ve been through the last 38 hours,” she told 7 News.\n\nWhen Young finally received surgery the following year, she told News 7 that surgeons removed a number of large bone spurs in her back that had not previously been discernible through an MRI.\n\nYoung claimed to 7 News that the operation took \"an extra four hours longer than what it was supposed to, due to the severity of the condition,\" and she believes her delay in care and surgery ultimately led to permanent damage.\n\n“I feel like now, because I wasn’t essential, and they didn’t act quick enough, that I’ve been left with permanent nerve damage and constant cramps every single night,” she explained to 7 News.\n\nIn a statement to PEOPLE, Townsville Hospital and Health Service chief executive Kieran Keyes said, \"While I acknowledge this patient’s experience and understand the distress associated with complex and chronic pain conditions, investigations into these claims have found that the patient’s concerns were not ignored and the care provided by our staff was appropriate.\"\n\nThe PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now!\n\n“The patient has previously raised a number of concerns with Townsville Hospital and Health Service regarding emergency department presentations, the use of Ryan’s Rule and the timing of follow-up treatment,” she continued. \"These matters were reviewed through our established patient feedback processes and were also referred to the independent Office of the Health Ombudsman, which concluded in January 2025 that the complaint had been managed appropriately.\"\n\n\"In relation to the patient’s presentations to the emergency department in March 2023, on each occasion, the patient was clinically assessed, provided pain relief, and managed appropriately based on symptoms and a clinical examination,\" Keyes added. \"In relation to claims about Ryan’s Rule, our senior clinical staff thoroughly reviewed the patient following concerns raised during one of her presentations to the emergency department. This included a senior medical officer, a clinical nurse consultant and an after-hours nurse manager. Hospital records indicate that no further Ryan’s Rule escalation was activated following these reviews.\"\n\nKeyes also said that \"Townsville Hospital and Health Service remains committed to providing safe, respectful and patient-centred care, and encourages any patient with concerns about their treatment to contact our patient feedback service.\"\n\nThe Office of the Health Ombudsman did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’S request for comment.\n\nYoung told 7 News that she is speaking out now because, while she has the privilege of advocating for herself, she worries about others who may not be able to do the same.\n\n“I’ve got a voice,” she said. “I can talk and advocate for myself, but it leaves me worried about the more vulnerable people that don’t know their rights, that are too afraid to speak up.”",

    "description": "\"It's time to build\" means there's no time to bone.",
    "fullText": "There's two things that I care about the most: the gym and my work,\" says Mahir Laul.\n\nThe 18-year-old took a leave of absence from New York University this past fall to work full-time on his HR tech startup, Velric. While his classmates are taking shots and hooking up, Laul is coding and lifting. That means almost no time for romance.\n\n\"I am obsessed with work,\" he tells me. \"My love life is in the gutters.\"\n\nHis young founder friends are a similar story, he says. The few who are dating found their partners before they started their companies, while the rest are \"locked in\" on building — and locking themselves out of the dating pool.\n\nSilicon Valley has long been the land where mixing work with play was seen as crucial to its growth. While Google and Facebook were being built, their staff were also tripping on ayahuasca and canoodling in \"cuddle puddles.\" Now, amid the white-collar job apocalypse and the cutthroat AI race, tech has gone hardcore. Ramp has seen a spike in corporate card purchases on Saturdays in the Bay Area. Foot traffic at San Francisco office buildings was up 21.6% year over year in July, per Placer.ai, the highest uptick among major cities. And as I found in conversations with more than two dozen young tech professionals, the industry's upstarts are pounding through hourslong coding sprints, working 996 schedules (9 a.m. to 6 p.m., six days a week), and proudly telling their investors and X followers how they've gone \"monk mode\" in service of scaling their startups.\n\nFor many in Silicon Valley's young hustle class, \"it's time to build\" means there's no time to bone. They're on one type of grind, and it's not on the dance floor, which shuts down early in San Francisco anyway. Tech's dating scene, never particularly hot, has frozen over.\n\nHackathons, pitch decks, scrambling for investors — the life of a startup founder has never been amenable to a rich dating life. Lauren Kay, a former dating app founder who now runs a literary business, tells me that when she was a member of the 2014 Y Combinator class, she had to ask her cofounder for permission to go on a first date at 10 p.m. on a Saturday. Still, she did meet her husband in that YC class. Douglas Feigelson, a member of that same class, says \"there was opportunity to drink and date when I was in YC.\"\n\nA decade later, many founders feel like they can't afford to make the time.\n\nA good relationship is like a good startup, says Daivik Goel, the 27-year-old founder of the payroll platform Shor. \"It takes a lot of time to nurture at the beginning if you want to do them right.\" For now, he only has the bandwidth to nurture one. Like many of his founder friends, he says, he's not on any dating apps, and he doesn't seek out hookups at bars. \"I haven't had the time to really invest yet.\"\n\nSeveral founders I spoke to described dating in founder terms. \"The opportunity cost is really high,\" says Annie Liao, the 24-year-old founder of AI learning startup Build Club. \"Every night you spent out is time you could have spent building your startup.\" She adds, \"Most founders wait until the startup is more stable, like Series B.\"\n\nLiao says her founder roommates aren't dating either. They hook up sometimes for fun — so long as they don't get \"emotionally attached.\" For those working seven days a week on their startup, opening Hinge is \"a big, big distraction,\" she says.\n\nSome blame the dating recession on tech workers treating dating like an extension of their work. Liao says her male friends often give women ratings, \"like KPIs.\" These ratings are out of 10, and offer a \"numerical logical quantification justified in their brains to help them make an informed decision on who to date.\" Allie Hoffman, founder of dating event The Feels, tells me her San Francisco clients often ask her: \"Am I going to meet my unicorn here?\"\n\nAmy Andersen, CEO of Linx Dating, says that founders who have spent years focusing on \"optimization\" and \"ROI\" are now approaching her, looking for an equally perfect partner.\n\n\"People want to biohack love,\" she says. \"They're not necessarily thinking intelligently.\"\n\nStartup advisor Dylan Oriundo has another theory: fear. Founders aren't just afraid to give up precious building time; they're also skeptical of the motives of their potential suitors as they build their potential unicorns.\n\n\"They're not going to want me because I don't have enough money,\" Oriundo says. \"Once I reach a certain goal, they're just going to want me for my money.\"\n\nTony Bennett notwithstanding, the city has long had a reputation for its poor dating scene. Some blame it on San Francisco's wealth gap; others blame the \"ratio\" — the perceived numbers gap between men and women. The city is comprised of 51% men and 49% women, which some men say gives women the dating edge. The gender disparities likely grow even wider within tight tech circles, with women accounting for 13.2% of startup founders in 2023, and about a quarter of the tech workforce.\n\n\"If you're straight and a guy, there's just not that many women,\" says Wesley Tian, cofounder of the AI photo platform Aragon. Fed up with San Francisco dating, he says that some of his friends \"import\" people from other cities: They'll travel to another hub, meet someone, convince them to do long-distance, and eventually get them to move to the Bay Area. Some of Tian's friends in tech are moving to New York so they can date.\n\nFilip Kozera, founder of the Y-Combinator-backed Wordware and a native of Poland, tells me that he's interested in women who have creative interests like painting or singing, but finds that most of the women in San Francisco are interested in tech. So he mainly goes to Europe to date. He also shares his plan to fix the city: Take 10,000 women in Miami, teach them that having \"a boat is not the most important thing in life,\" and ship them to San Francisco. (Maybe if these women were swapped with 10,000 deep learning engineers, Miami's long-promised tech scene would finally arrive.)\n\nAnd still others say the \"ratio\" is more of a mirage, and an excuse. Joyce Zhang, a San Francisco-based dating coach and former Stripe product manager, tells me that when her male clients complain about the ratio, she asks them: \"What is in your control that you can change?\"\n\n\"Who are the men who are actually emotionally available?\" she tells them. \"If you can do the work to be that, there will be plenty of options for you.\"\n\nThose in tech's rising class who are dating, I found, had been in their relationships long before they began building and pitching.\n\nYang Fan Yun met his girlfriend during his first semester at Stanford, years before he cofounded the browser assistant startup Composite. They dated for all of college, and eventually went long distance when she moved to New York and he stayed in the Bay Area.\n\nThe New York-San Francisco long-distance relationship was common among Yun's tech friends. Even more common: \"not dating.\"\n\n\"Being in a relationship is really helpful for building the company,\" he said, describing his girlfriend, who works at a bank, as a constant supporter and the company's first product tester.\n\nSeveral of the tech workers I spoke to seemed to hope for the same thing, to have an unconditional support system through the grueling slog of building a startup. The future Zucks and Bezoses yearn for their Priscilla Chans and MacKenzie Scotts. (Those entrepreneurial forebearers are even pushing for marriage. Tech titans like Elon Musk and Peter Thiel warn about a fertility crisis. Anduril cofounder Palmer Luckey says that people should have kids in their teens.)\n\n\"You've always heard the mentality, 'Behind every successful man, there's the right woman,'\" Laul say. \"Rather than looking for hookups, I tend to look for someone as a life partner. But it's been difficult.\"\n\nSean Horan, a professor of communications at Fairfield University who studies romance and the workplace, points to some theories of \"positive life-to-work spillover.\"\n\n\"If my personal life is fulfilled, I'll actually be happier at work, which should contribute to productivity,\" he says.\n\nAnd there are exceptions to tech's dating dry spell. Queer daters may be better off. They're unencumbered by San Francisco's ratio, and find a flourishing LGBTQ+ scene in the city.\n\nSorcerer cofounder Jia Chen grew up in Michigan. Moving to San Francisco, she's found bigger populations of queer and East Asian daters. \"There are so many accomplished girls that are very multidimensional,\" she says.\n\nSome of the locked-in and lonely, meanwhile, are turning to other solutions. I heard founders describe first dates where the pair worked side-by-side. Other tech couples are finding each other on the hottest new dating app: LinkedIn. When I ask Shruti Gandhi, an investor at Array Ventures, if young founders are using actual dating apps, she laughs. \"Yeah, she says, \"to network.\"\n\nHenry Chandonnet is a reporter on the Business News desk.

    "description": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom is headed to Davos to challenge President Donald Trump's economic agenda.",
    "fullText": "A tiny Swiss ski town with a population of just over 10,000 will play host this week to a clash between two American politicians, President Donald Trump and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, and their radically different visions of the future of capitalism.\n\nNewsom announced on Friday that he will travel more than 6,000 miles to make his return to Davos, Switzerland, to speak this week at the World Economic Forum.\n\nOpponents criticized Newsom for being an out-of-touch \"Davos Democrat\" for attending the elite gathering of business and world leaders at least five times while he was mayor of San Francisco between 2004 and 2011.\n\nNewsom's return to the annual gathering of business and political elites is all about displaying a forceful rebuke to President Donald Trump on the world stage as Newsom potentially prepares a run for president, political experts told Business Insider.\n\n\"Newsom's arrival at Davos confirms his desire to be seen as the Democratic Party leader and go-to guy for world leaders wanting an alternative to President Trump,\" Sally Susman, a longtime democratic fundraiser, said.\n\nIn speeches and meetings, Newsom plans to argue that Trump's economic agenda has been a failure that other leaders should not be part of, Izzy Gardon, a Newsom spokesperson, said.\n\n\"The Governor will be bringing an extra suitcase of kneepads for anyone lining up to bend the knee to Donald Trump,\" Gardon said.\n\nNewsom himself did not shy away from the main reason he is returning: to counterpunch Trump. The president will speak on Wednesday, a day before Newsom.\n\n\"Trump's economic agenda betrays our nation: it is not 'America First' but 'Trump First' — rewarding the favored, punishing the dissenters, and burdening the rest,\" Newsom said in a statement. \"At the World Economic Forum, I will forcefully confront these abuses and resolutely defend the principles to which California owes its economic strength: disciplined governance, world-leading universities, boundless innovation, and an open embrace of global cultures.\"\n\nNewsom, who has yet to officially announce his candidacy, looks more presidential rubbing shoulders at a gathering of world leaders than he would staying in Sacramento, according to Ambassador Derek Shearer, the Chevalier Professor of Diplomacy at Occidental College.\n\n\"By coming to Davos, he can combine his role as the leading Democratic critic of Trump and as a serious contender to replace him as president,\" Shearer said. \"Of course, it's a high-stakes game, but so far, he is playing it well.\"\n\nNewsom will be rubbing shoulders with some of the richest people in the world at a time when some billionaires are fleeing California ahead of a ballot proposal that would impose a one-time 5% tax on residents with a net worth of more than $1 billion.\n\nNewsom has said he opposes the measure. It is yet to be seen if he will address the matter at Davos.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — When President Donald Trump announced the audacious capture of Nicolás Maduro to face drug trafficking charges in the U.S., he portrayed the strongman’s vice president and longtime aide as America’s preferred partner to stabilize Venezuela amid a scourge of drugs, corruption and economic mayhem.\n\nLeft unspoken was the cloud of suspicion that long surrounded Delcy Rodríguez before she became acting president of the beleaguered nation earlier this month.\n\nIn fact, Rodríguez has been on the radar of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration for years and in 2022 was even labeled a “priority target,” a designation DEA reserves for suspects believed to have a “significant impact” on the drug trade, according to records obtained by The Associated Press and more than a half dozen current and former U.S. law enforcement officials.\n\nThe DEA has amassed a detailed intelligence file on Rodríguez dating to at least 2018, the records show, cataloging her known associates and allegations ranging from drug trafficking to gold smuggling. One confidential informant told the DEA in early 2021 that Rodríguez was using hotels in the Caribbean resort of Isla Margarita “as a front to launder money,” the records show. As recently as last year she was linked to Maduro’s alleged bag man, Alex Saab, whom U.S. authorities arrested in 2020 on money laundering charges.\n\nThe U.S. government has never publicly accused Rodríguez of any criminal wrongdoing. Notably for Maduro’s inner circle, she’s not among the more than a dozen current Venezuelan officials charged with drug trafficking alongside the ousted president.\n\nRodríguez’s name has surfaced in nearly a dozen DEA investigations, several of which remain ongoing, involving agents in field offices from Paraguay and Ecuador to Phoenix and New York, the AP learned. The AP could not determine the specific focus of each investigation.\n\nThree current and former DEA agents who reviewed the records at the request of AP said they indicate an intense interest in Rodríguez throughout much of her tenure as vice president, which began in 2018. They were not authorized to discuss DEA investigations and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThe records reviewed by AP do not make clear why Rodríguez was elevated to a “priority target,” a designation that requires extensive documentation to justify additional investigative resources. The agency has hundreds of priority targets at any given moment, and having the label does not necessarily lead to being charged criminally.\n\n“She was on the rise, so it’s not surprising that she might become a high-priority target with her role,” said Kurt Lunkenheimer, a former federal prosecutor in Miami who has handled multiple cases related to Venezuela. “The issue is when people talk about you and you become a high-priority target, there’s a difference between that and evidence supporting an indictment.”\n\nVenezuela's communications ministry did not respond to emails seeking comment.\n\nThe DEA and U.S. Justice Department also did not respond to requests for comment. Asked whether the president trusts Rodríguez, the White House referred AP to Trump’s earlier remarks on a “very good talk” he had with the acting president Wednesday, one day before she met in Caracas with CIA Director John Ratcliffe.\n\nAlmost immediately after Maduro’s capture, Trump started heaping praise on Rodríguez — this past week referring to her as a \"terrific person — in close contact with officials in Washington, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nThe DEA’s interest in Rodríguez comes even as Trump has sought to install her as the steward of American interests to navigate a volatile post-Maduro Venezuela, said Steve Dudley, co-director of InSight Crime, a think tank focused on organized crime in the Americas.\n\n“The current Venezuela government is a criminal-hybrid regime. The only way you reach a position of power in the regime is by, at the very least, abetting criminal activities,” said Dudley, who has investigated Venezuela for years. “This isn’t a bug in the system. This is the system.”\n\nThose sentiments were echoed by opposition leader María Corina Machado, who met with Trump at the White House Thursday in a bid to push for more U.S. support for Venezuelan democracy.\n\n“The American justice system has sufficient information about her,” said Machado, referring to Rodríguez. “Her profile is quite clear.”\n\nRodríguez, 56, worked her way to the apex of power in Venezuela as a loyal aide to Maduro, with whom she shares a deep-seated leftist bent stemming from her socialist father’s death in police custody when she was only 7 years old. Despite blaming the U.S. for her father’s death, she steadily worked while foreign minister and later vice president to court American investment during the first Trump administration, hiring lobbyists close to Trump and even ordering the state oil company to make a $500,000 donation to his inaugural committee.\n\nThe charm offensive flopped when Trump, urged on by Rubio, pressured Maduro to hold free and fair elections. In September 2018,the White House sanctioned Rodríguez, describing her as key to Maduro’s grip on power and ability to “solidify his authoritarian rule.” She was also sanctioned earlier by the European Union.\n\nBut those allegations focused on her threat to Venezuela’s democracy, not any alleged involvement in corruption.\n\n“Venezuela is a failed state that supports terrorism, corruption, human rights abuses and drug trafficking at the highest echelons. There is nothing political about this analysis,” said Rob Zachariasiewicz, a longtime former DEA agent who led investigations into top Venezuelan officials and is now a managing partner at Elicius Intelligence, a specialist investigations firm. “Delcy Rodríguez has been part of this criminal enterprise.”\n\nThe DEA records seen by AP provide an unprecedented glimpse into the agency’s interest in Rodríguez. Much of it was driven by the agency’s elite Special Operations Division, the same Virginia-based unit that worked with prosecutors in Manhattan to indict Maduro.\n\nOne of the records cites an unnamed confidential informant linking Rodríguez to hotels in Margarita Island that are allegedly used as a front to launder money. The AP has been unable to independently confirm the information.\n\nThe U.S. has long considered the resort island, northeast of the Venezuelan mainland, a strategic hub for drug trafficking routes to the Caribbean and Europe. Numerous traffickers have been arrested or taken haven there over the years, including representatives of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán’s Sinaloa cartel.\n\nThe records also indicate the feds were looking at Rodríguez’s involvement in government contracts awarded to Maduro’s ally Saab — investigations that remain ongoing even after President Joe Biden pardoned him in 2023 as part of a prisoner swap for Americans imprisoned in Venezuela.\n\nThe Colombian businessman rose to become one of Venezuela’s top fixers as U.S. sanctions cut off its access to hard currency and Western banks. He was arrested in 2020 on federal charges of money laundering while traveling from Venezuela to Iran to negotiate oil deals helping both countries circumvent sanctions.\n\nIn an unrelated matter, the DEA records also indicate agents’ interest in Rodríguez’s possible involvement in allegedly corrupt deals between the government and Omar Nassif-Sruji, a relative of a longtime romantic partner of Rodríguez's, Yussef Nassif.\n\nNassif-Sruji did not respond to emails and text messages seeking comment and an attorney for Nassif denied his client was involved in any nefarious activity, pointing out that he hasn't been accused of any crime.\n\n\"He has the utmost respect and confidence in the acting president's vision for Venezuela and believes she is a true patriot who has committed her entire life to the betterment of the Venezuelan people,\" the attorney, Jihad M. Smaili, said in a statement. “The insinuations that Mr. Nassif is currently involved in any untoward relationship with the acting president are false.”\n\nTaken together, the DEA investigations underscore how power has long been exercised in Venezuela, which is ranked as the world’s third most corrupt country by Transparency International. For Rodríguez, they also represent something of a razor-sharp sword over her head, breathing life to Trump’s threat soon after Maduro’s ouster that she would “pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro” if she didn’t fall in line. The president added that he wanted her to provide the U.S. “total access” to the country’s vast oil reserves and other natural resources.\n\n“Just being a leader in a highly corrupted regime for over a decade makes it logical that she is a priority target for investigation,” said David Smilde, a Tulane University professor who has studied Venezuela for three decades. “She surely knows this, and it gives the U.S. government leverage over her. She may fear that if she does not do as the Trump administration demands, she could end up with an indictment like Maduro.”\n\nMustian reported from New York.\n\nContact AP’s global investigative team at Investigative@ap.org or https://www.ap.org/tips/.\n\nThis story is part of an ongoing collaboration between The Associated Press and FRONTLINE (PBS) that includes an upcoming documentary.",

    "title": "I had 90 days to find a job after getting laid off while on a work visa. A $50 book helped me land my dream role.",
    "description": "With just 90 days to find a job, a laid-off visa holder used email hunting and a $50 book to land a new role at T-Mobile.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Aman Goyal, a 26-year-old associate product manager at T-Mobile. His words have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was laid off in September, just six months into my role as an AI product manager at an ad tech company. Because I'm from India and was on an F-1 optional practical training (OPT) visa, the layoff triggered an immediate 90-day deadline to either find a new job or leave the US.\n\nDuring my last job search in 2024, while finishing a master's degree in management information systems at Carnegie Mellon University, I submitted hundreds of applications before landing an offer.\n\nThis time, the tech job market felt even tougher — marked by widespread layoffs, uncertainty around the Trump administration's proposed $100K H-1B salary rule, and intensifying competition for AI-related roles.\n\nDespite these challenges, I landed my dream role within 60 days as an agentic AI product manager at T-Mobile. These three things helped me get the job.\n\nAfter learning I'd been laid off, I took a few days to process the news before diving into my job search. It was a big surprise, as I had recently received a positive performance review.\n\nWith my visa deadline looming, I knew I couldn't afford to wait long before starting to look. I applied for roles at several top tech companies and a few startups, but the startups that responded weren't willing to sponsor visas.\n\nI came across three roles at T-Mobile and applied to all of them. A friend referred me for two of the roles, but I accidentally left his name off the third application. Interestingly, the only role I heard back from was the one I wasn't referred for.\n\nThe job description was closely aligned with my past experience, and the lack of a referral didn't hurt me. I think referrals have become highly overrated, especially since it seems like almost everyone has one.\n\nMy referral contact was helpful in another way, though. I asked if he knew who the hiring manager was for the role, and he shared the hiring manager's name. I used the email-finding tool Hunter.io, which offers a free plan with a monthly search limit, to look up the hiring manager's email and sent a short message expressing my interest in the role.\n\nI could've asked my referral contact for the hiring manager's email, but not everyone feels comfortable sharing someone else's contact information, so it's helpful to have tools that let you find it yourself.\n\nFortunately, I found the right contact — and shortly after, the hiring manager connected me with the recruiter to schedule interviews.\n\nLanding an interview was only half the battle, and I knew I had to be fully prepared to make the most of the opportunity, so I spent about $50 on \"Decode and Conquer,\" a product management interview preparation guide by Lewis Lin.\n\nWhat I found most valuable about the community after I joined was how easily I could schedule mock interviews with other job seekers. Over about six weeks, I completed a few dozen mock interviews — some with senior or staff product managers at Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. A few of them were also hiring managers in their current roles, which made their feedback especially valuable.\n\nOne of the most helpful parts of the mock interviews was that they helped me build confidence and develop the muscle memory to answer questions spontaneously.\n\nDoing practice interviews — and also many real-life interviews — also helped me realize that many people focus too much on what they say during interviews and not enough on how they say it. It's essential to pace yourself, keep the interviewer engaged, and be mindful of how you're coming across, especially since attention spans are often short nowadays.\n\nSome interviewers prefer concise answers, while others appreciate more detailed responses. You have to read their body language and adjust your responses accordingly. I also learned how important it is to really understand the question before answering — instead of just reciting a rehearsed response.\n\nThe community also proved valuable for networking.\n\nOver about five weeks, I completed six interviews with T-Mobile that covered a range of topics, from product design to system thinking and agentic AI. I felt confident throughout the process.\n\nI received an offer in early November, about six weeks after being laid off, and started the role later that month. Today, I'm working on projects closely aligned with my background in AI, and I'm genuinely excited about the direction of my work.\n\nOne of the biggest pieces of advice I give to the young job seekers I mentor is that even in a tough job market, networking can still work. It may not come through a traditional referral, but in my experience, finding a way to connect directly with the recruiter or hiring manager can be a game changer.",

    "title": "America's homebuilding is powered by immigrant workers. Here are the places that rely on them the most.",
    "description": "American cities that build and remodel the most homes are also the most reliant on immigrant labor, new research found.",
    "fullText": "The American homebuilding industry relies heavily on immigrant workers. That's especially true in the cities that build and remodel the most homes, according to new research from Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies.\n\nIn the seven metro areas that issued at least 150,000 residential building permits between 2019 and 2023, an average of 54% of construction trades workers were foreign-born, the Harvard report found. The metros building and remodeling the most homes — from Los Angeles and Washington, DC, to Dallas and Houston — rely on a workforce that's often more than 60% foreign-born.\n\nThe construction industry faces a nationwide worker shortage in the hundreds of thousands. Given its reliance on foreign-born workers, President Donald Trump's mass deportations and restrictions on immigration threaten to deepen the worker shortfall, said Anirban Basu, the chief economist at Associated Builders and Contractors, a trade group that endorsed Trump in 2024.\n\nAs a result, economists and housing researchers expect the most dynamic US housing markets will be hit the hardest by rising construction costs — driven by higher labor costs and delays, in part due to the worker shortage.\n\n\"These places that are most reliant on immigrant labor are going to feel those effects most acutely, and may then have a hampered ability to respond to housing supply and demand needs,\" said Riordan Frost, a senior research analyst at the Harvard Center and the author of the report.\n\nMetros that build fewer homes tend to have far fewer immigrants as a share of their construction workforce. In metros that granted between 75,000 and 149,999 permits, an average of 40% of the workers were foreign-born. And in metros that permitted less than 75,000 homes, 22% of the workforce was foreign-born. Still, immigrants made up a disproportionate share of the construction workforce in those places, too.\n\nThe Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington metro area led the country in issuing new building permits between 2019 and 2023. During that period, 61% of the area's construction workers were immigrants. In that same period, nearly three-quarters of construction workers in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Pompano Beach area were foreign-born.\n\n\"There's demand for labor in these places because there's so much homebuilding activity, and that is what creates the economic opportunity for immigrants to come in and fill these positions, especially if they're positions that native born people aren't as likely to work in,\" Frost said.\n\nA recent survey by the Associated General Contractors of America found that 28% of construction firms say they've been affected, either directly or indirectly, by immigration enforcement. More than 90% of all firms that were hiring said they were having trouble filling open roles, and 45% of all firms said they experienced project delays because of a shortage of workers.\n\n\"There's no question in my mind the stepped-up immigration enforcement is serving to drive up construction delivery costs,\" Basu said. \"If all of a sudden these communities are no longer able to supply as much new housing, then their economic growth will tend to stagnate.\"\n\nAt the same time as the administration is cracking down on legal and illegal immigration, it's not doing enough to boost domestic construction training, AGC said.\n\nThe Trump administration says it's working with employers to streamline visa applications for temporary workers and boost vocational training.\n\n\"There is no shortage of American minds and hands to grow our labor force, and President Trump's agenda to create jobs for American workers represents this Administration's commitment to capitalizing on that untapped potential while delivering on our mandate to enforce our immigration laws,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement.\n\nImmigrants have long made up a disproportionate share of the country's construction tradespeople, particularly in homebuilding. And, as of 2024, an estimated 15 to 23% of the total construction workforce was living in the country illegally. In recent years, the number of native-born construction workers has shrunk significantly.\n\nIn the long term, improvements in construction productivity — including the growth of modular, factory-built housing — and a growing number of women and young people entering the industry could ease the worker shortage.\n\nBut for the next several years, at least, the worker shortage is set to worsen, helping drive up building costs and home prices.\n\n\"The construction workforce is set to become more expensive going forward,\" Basu said. \"And then when you layer on top of that, of course, increases in healthcare costs, electricity rates, those kinds of things, there's even more pressure on these households going forward.\"",

    "fullText": "We here at Business Insider thought it was time to talk about the future of capitalism.\n\nSeems we weren't the only ones.\n\nWhen California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced late last week that he would show up at Davos essentially to rebut whatever President Donald Trump plans to say, he specifically zoned in on, what else? Capitalism.\n\nAt Davos, the Democratic governor plans to \"draw a clear line between democratic capitalism and crony capitalism,\" according to his office. Newsom will \"contrast California's rules-based, competitive economic model with Trump's politics of intimidation, favoritism, and self-dealing.\"\n\nIn short, Newsom wants to articulate his own version of capitalism on the global stage.\n\nThat, coupled with Trump's Wednesday speech, which is expected to touch on affordability, shows just how hot the topic is.\n\nYou might recall that last month we put out a survey seeking your thoughts on the future of capitalism. And in the new year, we started a series on the subject. The first piece detailed the federal government's investments in private-sector companies under this White House. Newsom's office called those investments \"an unprecedented assault on free markets\" and took issue with other Trump moves.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Newsom's statements. A White House official earlier told Business Insider they viewed these equity stakes \"as a very powerful tool that we're using very judiciously in very specific sectors for very specific reasons,\" for purposes of US economic and national security.\n\nWe will stay all over this subject at Davos this week.

    "description": "Tesla owners' reactions to Elon Musk's announcement that FSD would only be available for $99 a month ranged from frustration to enthusiasm.",
    "fullText": "Tesla is going all in on the Netflix model for its self-driving software — and owners we talked to have mixed feelings about the move.\n\nOn Wednesday, CEO Elon Musk announced that Tesla's supervised Full Self-Driving software — known as FSD — will only be offered behind its $99-a-month paywall after February 14.\n\nIt's a major shift for the electric-car maker. Tesla first began selling its self-driving software in late 2016 for $5,000, later raising the price (it's currently $8,000) and introducing a monthly subscription option in 2021.\n\nNow, drivers who want their car to steer, brake, and change lanes on its own will only have the option to pay $99 month to month.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with three Tesla owners about the change. Their reactions ranged from frustration to enthusiasm.\n\n\"It's a big turnoff for me,\" Leslie Snipes, an owner of a standard-range Model 3, told Business Insider. \"Especially since nearly everything is now a subscription.\"\n\nSnipes said she tested FSD during a complimentary one-month trial when she bought her car in 2022. She loved the feature at the time, but a lifetime purchase cost $10,000 back then — a cost she said was too high for her family.\n\nNow, her biggest concern is safety.\n\n\"I have much less confidence in Tesla's self-driving,\" she said. \"I've had multiple experiences where the cameras were inoperable due to low-light conditions or obstructions like rain, which makes this shift concerning.\"\n\nShe said she'd only consider paying for FSD for specific months, like when she is planning long road trips.\n\nScott Anderson, who just bought a Model Y in Arizona, said he never seriously considered paying thousands of dollars upfront for the software. He chose the monthly subscription and remains excited about the tech.\n\n\"My wife and I recently took a trip about 70 miles from home up into the mountains,\" he said. \"Our new car drove us the entire way without any interruptions.\"\n\nAnderson added that he hopes the monthly price will eventually come down as Tesla rolls out more advanced technology.\n\nBut for longtime Tesla owners who have already outright purchased the software, Musk's announcement carries different implications.\n\n\"I find myself using FSD more and more as I drive,\" Nikki Lindgren, a California Tesla owner who bought the technology years ago, told Business Insider. \"The change would mostly modify if or when we replace our current Tesla.\"\n\nLindgren said the shift to subscriptions could discourage her from buying a new Tesla unless the company allows customers to transfer previously purchased software to another vehicle.\n\nTesla didn't respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nTesla is facing some critical self-driving deadlines this year, including its robotaxis entering more major cities and ramping up volume production of the Cybercab.\n\nDelivering on the promises carries enormous weight for CEO Elon Musk. His attention-grabbing $1 trillion pay package is tied in part to the company's self-driving vision, raising the pressure to prove that its technology — and the revenue it generates — is moving closer to full autonomy.\n\nSeth Goldstein, a Morningstar analyst who monitors Tesla, said the company's switch to monthly subscriptions indicates \"growing confidence\" inside the EV maker about its technology's momentum. He even thinks drivers might soon be able to take their eyes off the road when the car is in FSD.\n\nBut he doesn't think that rollout will be paired with lower prices for consumers.\n\n\"Once unsupervised is released, I expect the price will rise to reflect the additional driving capabilities and we could see Tesla offer bundles that include charging and insurance in some states,\" he said. \"Admittedly, this just shifts the payment from one loan payment including the vehicle and FSD to two payments.\"\n\nGoldstein said he thinks most drivers will respond like Snipes, the most skeptical Tesla owner that Business Insider spoke to.\n\n\"This may lead to some consumers purchasing a Tesla as they can choose to buy FSD later or only purchase it in months when they plan to take a longer trip,\" he said.",

    "title": "Legendary investor Rob Arnott outlines the 2-part strategy that's helped his personal stock portfolio double the S&P 500 over 8 months",
    "description": "Rob Arnott's personal investment strategy takes advantage of a flaw in passive indexing  that his firm has also tried to capitalize on with a recent ETF.",
    "fullText": "Rob Arnott is revered in the investing world for his alternative passive index strategies, but when it comes to his own portfolio, the Research Affiliates founder likes to have a little fun playing the role of hedge-fund manager, too.\n\nIn an interview on Thursday, Arnott detailed a leveraged long-short strategy that has allowed him to double the returns of the S&P 500 over the last eight months. He shared with Business Insider screenshots of his personal brokerage account showing this strategy having produced a 36.67% return since mid-May. The S&P 500 has returned about 14% in that time.\n\nThe strategy comes from the idea behind the ETF Arnott launched in September: the RACWI US ETF (RAUS). The fund takes a fundamental approach to indexing, identifying companies with attractive qualities and valuations, and then weighting them by market capitalization.\n\nIt essentially seeks to correct what Arnott sees as flaws in passive indexes like the S&P 500, which add stocks following periods of outperformance, only to dump them when they've underperformed. RAUS has a 95% overlap with the S&P 500.\n\nSeeking to capitalize on this concept outside the index, Arnott had the idea to take long positions on the stocks that his index includes which the S&P 500 does not, and take short positions on stocks that the S&P 500 includes but his index does not. He then amplified those positions with leverage.\n\n\"One really fun strategy, and I wish this had occurred to me back in '21, is what if we go long our non-overlap holdings, strip out the whole 95% that's overlapped, just go long our 5% non overlap and let's short the S&P's 5% non overlap,\" Arnott said, referencing when Research Affiliates launched its Cap-Weighted Index, on which RAUS is based. \"Why stop there? Why not go 200% long and 200% short? I did that in my personal portfolio.\"\n\nArnott could not share the names of individual stocks in his portfolio for compliance reasons. However, in September, he listed Palantir (PLTR), DoorDash (DASH), and CrowdStrike (CRWD) as examples of S&P 500 stocks not in RAUS. Examining a list of RAUS's holdings, a few examples of stocks held in RAUS that are not in the S&P 500 include Xerox (XRX), Zoom Communications (ZM), and Rivian Motors (RIVN).\n\n\"One of my colleagues likes to say, 'Suppose I come to you and I say I've got this great strategy: I'm going to buy stocks when they've just doubled and when they're trading at twice the market multiple, and I'm going to sell stocks when they've just fallen in half and are trading at half the market multiple. Why don't you invest with me?'\" Arnott said. \"Most people would listen to that and say that's stupid, but that's the way index funds trade.\"\n\nIn September, Arnott illustrated this inefficiency in passive index funds with Dillard's Department Store, a repeat constituent of the Russell 1000 index.\n\n\"In the last quarter century, it has been removed from the index and added back to the index four times,\" Arnott said at the time. \"So buy low, high, low, four times, and every time you're doing enormous damage to your wealth if it's the only stock you're trading.\"\n\n\"How big a difference does it make? It's been a member of the Russell 1000 in 22 of the last 35 years. During those 22 years, it has underperformed the Russell index by 99%,\" he continued. \"In the 13 years that it wasn't a member, it gave you 67 times the wealth of the Russell 1000.\"",

    "description": "Shiyao Tang quit her $390K job at DoorDash to build a silk womenswear brand. Five months of careful planning helped her exit her corporate job.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Shiyao Tang, a 34-year-old business owner based in New York City and Paris. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was on a very strong upward trajectory in my manager role at DoorDash when I quit in 2025. I was making $390,000 and felt that I still had room to grow, but when I was honest with myself, my heart wasn't in it.\n\nLeaving to start my own silk womenswear brand wasn't an instantaneous decision; it was a long-term calling inside of me. It took a lot of courage to quit and choose the unknown.\n\nI still constantly ask myself if I made a huge mistake. I think to myself, \"How could I just leave a job that most people would dream of?\" It was high-paying, the benefits were great, and there was room for learning. But I don't want to look back and think I climbed the wrong mountain.\n\nIn 2022, I was hired as a strategy and operations manager on the homepage team at DoorDash. My job was challenging, and I got to wear a lot of hats. I also developed deep friendships with some truly talented people.\n\nHowever, I realized I missed the feeling of being close to the people I was building for.\n\nEarlier in my career, I had a small entrepreneurial chapter where I worked on a fashion wholesale startup. I built my own customers from the ground up and interacted with them every day.\n\nWhen I was 16, I moved from China to the US and later spent a year studying abroad in Paris. I've always lived between cultures and felt super energized by working with people from distinct backgrounds and creative disciplines. The more I thought about it, the more I realized I wanted my career to reflect that part of me, too.\n\nTech created a structure for me to learn and expand my horizon, but I was ready to try entrepreneurship again. I spent a lot of time journaling and reflecting on what business I really wanted to make.\n\nEvery weekend was dedicated to foundational discovery work and even talking to potential customers or friends to get some early feedback on different ideas. I even started connecting with other young, inspiring entrepreneurs at founder events, which expanded my horizons regarding what life might look like as an entrepreneur.\n\nFrankly, I was extremely scared every day, but seeing people thrive gave me more confidence to envision what it might look like for me. I decided on my business, Soir Si, where I make simple, minimal sculptural silk pieces. The mission is to make luxury accessible.\n\nEven though I was sure of my decision, walking away was scary, and honestly, it was really sad for me. However, the thought of not pushing to the edge of my potential was scarier than quitting.\n\nI have my own apartment in NYC, and I spend half my time in Paris, typically staying with friends or family, to fuel my creative inspiration during the design process.\n\nThe first month after quitting, I focused on building a strong visual and emotional identity for Soir Si by enrolling in online courses and even partnering with a freelancer. The next stages were developing my website, connecting directly with customers, and using my branding and website to open up my supply chain.\n\nNow I'm focused on securing and strengthening those relationships while sprinting toward product development.\n\nRight after quitting, I was so focused on transitioning into entrepreneurship that I didn't have time for self-doubt. I felt a mix of grief and sadness about leaving, but I also felt excitement about what was ahead of me. The doubts didn't start bubbling up until several weeks later, when I hit a steep learning curve. I realized I had no idea what went into manufacturing or production, or even how to find a pattern-maker.\n\nI remember the first time I visited some manufacturers in New York, they treated me like I had no idea what I was doing. I knew I didn't speak their \"language,\" and it felt alienating. However, those moments of self-doubt were always counterbalanced by the highs, such as building relationships with potential partners. For example, my branding designer is based in Italy, and my manufacturers are based in Portugal. Establishing those relationships from scratch without any experience gave me the assurance that I can really do this.\n\nEvery day, I wake up knowing I need to work really hard and give it my all to make this dream a reality. The gradual, positive feedback from peers or my audience feeds me every day, and it's fulfilling to work with people from around the world and get to talk about silk and the region it comes from.\n\nThere are still moments when I'm super scared about the path I chose. The self-doubt bubbles up, and it all feels overwhelming, but underneath it all is a steady sense that I'm building something that aligns with who I am, not just the perception of success or stability. I'm finally excited about life again.\n\nPeople might say this is a risky move, but everyone starts from nothing. I just had to be willing to take the first step.\n\nDo you have a story to share about quitting your six-figure job for a riskier path? If so, please reach out to the reporter at tmartinelli@businessinsider.com.",

    "title": "Student-loan borrowers behind on payments now have more time to figure out a plan — and protect their tax refunds",
    "description": "The Education Department just gave defaulted student-loan borrowers more time to figure out payment plans and ensure their tax refunds aren't seized.",
    "fullText": "If you're behind on your student-loan payments, you now have more time to figure out a payment plan before filing your taxes.\n\nThe Department of Education announced on January 16 that it's temporarily pausing wage garnishment and the Treasury Offset Program, which seizes federal tax refunds, to give defaulted borrowers more time to repay their loans.\n\nPrior to this pause, defaulted borrowers were subject to both wage garnishment and the seizure of their tax refunds. Advocacy group Protect Borrowers and the National Consumer Law Center issued a warning to student-loan borrowers before the department's announcement, urging them to check whether they're in default before filing their taxes to prevent their refunds from being seized.\n\nIn May 2025, President Donald Trump's Department of Education resumed collections on defaulted student loans after a five-year pause, meaning that borrowers in default — which typically happens when a federal borrower does not make payments for more than 270 days — were once again subject to the consequences of defaulting, including wage garnishment and seizure of tax refunds.\n\nWithout the pause in place, the government could begin seizing a defaulted borrower's tax refunds after they file, leaving them without sufficient time to make a plan to return their loans to good standing.\n\n\"Once you've already filed your taxes, that process is underway. It is going to be nearly impossible to get your loans out of default before your refund would go out,\" Abby Shafroth, managing director of advocacy at the National Consumer Law Center, told Business Insider of what would happen were the pause to lift. \"And then it's very, very unusual to be able to get that refund back after it's already been seized. So the real moment of opportunity for borrowers is before they file their taxes.\"\n\nThe two groups suggested that borrowers call the Treasury Department's Treasury Offset Program Call Center at 1-800-304-3107 to see if they're on the Treasury's default list for having some or all of their tax refunds seized.\n\nOver 5 million student-loan borrowers are in default, and Shafroth said that while the government is required to send a notice to borrowers informing them of their default status and that they're subject to garnishment and benefits seizures, those notices generally just go out once via physical mail, and they can be easy to miss or forget about.\n\nIf a borrower is in default and is on the list to have their refunds seized, they can request an extension to file their taxes, giving themselves more time to figure out their options. Those options include loan rehabilitation, which requires a borrower to contact their servicer and sign an agreement to make 9 payments within 20 days of each due date over 10 consecutive months. While the process is time-consuming, it has the benefit of eventually removing the default status from a borrower's credit report.\n\nAnother option is loan consolidation, which is quicker than rehabilitation but does not remove the default status from a borrower's credit history. A borrower can apply to consolidate their defaulted student loans into a federal direct loan, which they can then continue paying under an income-driven repayment plan.\n\nShafroth added that a borrower might be eligible to have their defaulted loan canceled if they qualify for specific cancellation programs, such as those for borrowers who attended schools that closed before they completed their programs.\n\n\"A lot of working people depend on their tax refund to make ends meet, to get caught up on rent, to pay for necessary car repairs or expenses,\" Shafroth said. \"So that tax refund isn't a bonus for most people. It's really built into their annual budget, and it's important to protect.\"",

    "description": "Dr. Shah said he saw the biggest change in his personal health when he did small things consistently. Here's what he prioritizes daily.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Dr. Darshan Shah, the 53-year-old founder and CEO of longevity clinic Next Health, who's based in Malibu, California. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been a physician for 30 years. For the first three quarters of my career, I did all sorts of surgeries, from trauma and emergency surgery, to general and reconstructive cancer surgery.\n\nI loved surgery, and I still miss being in the operating room, but I was totally burnt out. I was not happy. I did not want to go to work, and I thought, who wants to live this way?\n\nI switched into longevity medicine about 10 years ago. I made the transition because I was 50 pounds overweight, had high blood pressure, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and an autoimmune disease.\n\nI learned the science of nutrition, exercise, sleep, and functional medicine, brought all of that to my life, and got off all my medications and diagnoses of chronic diseases.\n\nThe experience made me realize that reversing chronic diseases is the kind of medicine that I want to practice. I started health optimization and longevity clinics to help people improve their lifestyle, optimize their hormones, and get them to think about how to prevent and reverse chronic disease.\n\nI always say the most important thing is to have a really good daily routine. It doesn't need to be any medications, injections, or anything fancy. I saw the biggest movement in my own personal health journey when I did the small things consistently.\n\nI start off my routine first thing in the morning because the whole world is asleep, and it's the only time I really have for myself.\n\nThe critical thing is what I don't do when I wake up. I don't wake up with my phone anywhere near me. I charge my cell phone by the coffee machine when I sleep, which is at the opposite end of the house.\n\nThat's a critical piece of my routine, because the phone deteriorates our mornings and stresses us out the minute we wake up. I don't look at my phone until 15 minutes after I've woken up.\n\nI'm lucky to have a little puppy now, but even before I had a puppy, I would go outside. I think it's extremely important to go outside first thing in the morning. If the sun isn't up yet, I go back outside when it's up because sunlight exposure is so important.\n\nThe physical act of taking your body outside is something that has been ingrained in our biology since caveman days. Going outside sets your circadian rhythm, decreases your stress levels, and improves your heart rate variability.\n\nMy morning routine is my sacred time. It goes until about 6:15 a.m.\n\nThe physical piece of my morning routine involves a quick 10- to 15-minute workout that includes stretching and lifting weights. Even if I don't get to the gym for the rest of the day, at least I got my workout in first thing.\n\nIt's so important to get quick wins. You can even start off with two minutes or five minutes a day. It doesn't matter. Once you get that quick win, it will build upon itself.\n\nAfter I do the workout, I grab a cup of coffee and take all my supplements. I put creatine in my coffee and drink a vitamin mix called IM8. I also take a couple of other supplements, including True Nitrogen, Urolithin A by Timeline, and a probiotic.\n\nThe second part of my routine is learning something new. I read for 20 minutes. I'm usually reading two different books — one about health and wellness physically, and one about health and wellness mentally.\n\nI'll read five or eight pages of each book, and it helps me have something to think about for the rest of the day.\n\nI've been journaling for 28 years now. I'm on a streak of 10 years without missing a single entry.\n\nMy journaling routine involves me writing about my day yesterday, what I'm most grateful for yesterday, and what I'm most excited for today.\n\nI skip breakfast because it allows me to control my total amount of calories throughout the day. I'm not ever hungry during breakfast and if I eat it, I won't get as good of a workout because I'll feel bloated.\n\nAfter I drop off my kids, I'll go to the gym and workout for about 45 minutes. Sometimes I'll do a cold plunge before the workout or right after I wake up, but it's so painful. I'll find every excuse in the world to skip it.\n\nI do some sprint interval training on the days that I'm working out, which is five 30-second sprints, with a four-minute break. A lot of research shows sprint interval training is the best way to improve your VO2 max, which is your body's capacity to utilize oxygen. I also always lift weights, using every muscle group.\n\nI live in Malibu, and the closest Next Health is about a 45-minute drive away. So I try to go to a location maybe once a week. Otherwise, I have a co-working facility in Malibu, and I just work out of there because it's five minutes away from my home.\n\nMy work involves lots of things. I'm on a Zoom call here and there; I have meetings; I do talks; I record podcasts; I speak to patients. There's a nice mix of things I love to do.\n\nThere are three things that are key to every work day.\n\nNo 1: I try to spend as much of my work day on my walking desk as possible. Normally, I'll get about 20,000 steps in a day.\n\nNo. 2: I always make sure I eat an early lunch, which is always a big piece of fish or meat, with a salad. Sometimes I'll throw it in a wrap or sometimes I'll supplement it with an additional protein shake.\n\nI eat 40 to 50 grams of protein in my lunch every single day. I also get a lot of vegetables in. I come from a family of diabetics, and snacking is probably the reason my entire family was diabetic, so I avoid snacking.\n\nNo. 3: If I'm sitting, I try to make sure I'm never sitting for more than 45 minutes in a row. If I'm in a sitting position, I'll set a timer. When I get up, I'll do a little bit of exercise, like jump rope or air squats. I have dumbbells in my office and just two to five minutes of that keeps the blood flowing and keeps you moving.\n\nAfter lunch, I usually have a meeting, and then I'll put a 20 to 30 minute break in my schedule to meditate.\n\nI'll go to a quiet place and turn everything off, turn the lights down, and get into a quick meditation. Lately I've been using my Oura ring. It has this unguided meditation session where it just plays some background music.\n\nAfter lunch, I'm a little tired, and so meditating really helps me decompress, get a little rest in, and recharge for the rest of the day.\n\nI did trauma surgery for six years and it was stress bombs every single day. Now I feel like I have a good handle on my stress because I got desensitized a little bit. That being said, there are stressful situations, and I just learned to pause, look inward, and give myself two minutes to recalibrate.\n\nUsually, I'm done with work by 4 p.m., and I'll pick up my kids from the bus stop and go home. I'll usually like help the kids with some homework, and hang out with the family and talk.\n\nWe try to have the earliest possible dinner. After we eat, we go for a walk, which starts my wind down routine.\n\nAfter the walk, around 7:30 p.m., I'll get rid of my cell phone and put it on the charger.\n\nThen we change all of our lights to yellow. It's beautiful and it's super relaxing.\n\nThen we start the bedtime routine. My kids are 11 and 7 years old, and they go to bed by 8 p.m. Then maybe I do some reading, or three or four days a week, I'll do a 30-minute sauna session. I get into bed by around 9:30 p.m.",

    "fullText": "Experts warn use of VPNs makes it hard to limit access to technology that can create nonconsensual explicit images\n\nDays after Malaysia made global headlines by announcing it would temporarily ban Grok over its ability to generate “grossly offensive and nonconsensual manipulated images”, the generative AI tool was conversing breezily with accounts registered in the country.\n\n“Still here! That DNS block in Malaysia is pretty lightweight – easy to bypass with a VPN or DNS tweak,” Grok’s account on X said in response to a question from a user.\n\nGrok’s ability to allow users to create sexually explicit images, including images of children, has created a global outcry over recent weeks, with regulators and politicians around the world launching investigations. Indonesia and Malaysia became the first two countries to announce blocks on the technology, with Malaysia’s regulatory body saying last Sunday it had “directed a temporary restriction” on access to Grok, effective as of 11 January 2026. Officials in the Philippines have said they too plan to ban the technology.\n\nBlocking access to Grok is not straightforward, however. The technology not only exists across multiple platforms, including a standalone app and website, but is also integrated across X, which, along with Grok, is owned by Elon Musk’s xAI.\n\nOver the past week, X users, and even Grok itself, have advised people on how to bypass restrictions. This includes using a VPN – many of which are available for free – or changing domain name system (DNS), the protocol on the internet that turns address names into IP addresses that load websites.\n\nWhen the Guardian tried to use Grok in Indonesia, its website was working even without a VPN, though the Grok app did not work. Grok was also still responding to Indonesian accounts on X, where it functions as an integrated chatbot. X has not been subject to a ban.\n\nEven if governments could completely restrict Grok, though, this is not a real solution, said Nana Nwachukwu, an AI governance expert and PhD researcher at Trinity College Dublin.\n\n“Blocking Grok is like slapping a Band-Aid on a weeping wound that you haven’t cleaned,” she said. “You block Grok, and then you go around shouting you’ve done something. Meanwhile, people can use VPNs to access the same platforms.” Or, they could simply turn to one of the many other platforms that offer the same functions, including “smaller, general purpose AI systems that are largely unknown”, Nwachukwu added.\n\nGovernments should instead focus on law enforcement and investigating individuals who use such tools to break the law, she added. “Platforms are required by law to provide information to law enforcement when a crime has been committed,” Nwachukwu said. “If we see people being arrested, people being tried in courts, people being jailed for these offences, that’s a sign that this is a real crime.”\n\nX should build accountability into its platform – and clean itself up, said Nwachukwu: “All of those offending images should be removed from the platform.”\n\nOn Wednesday, X announced additional safeguards in response to continued public anger, saying it would stop the @Grok account on X from “allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis”, including paid subscribers. However, the Guardian found that it was possible to get around such restrictions by using the standalone version of Grok, easily accessible through a web browser, to create short videos in which clothes are removed from images of real women.\n\nThis could then be posted to X’s public platform, where it could be viewed by users around the world within seconds.\n\nMusk’s company also said that, in jurisdictions where such content is illegal, it will geoblock the ability of all users in those locations to generate images of real people in bikinis, or similar attire, in Grok on X, adding that “xAI is implementing similar geoblocking measures for the Grok app”.\n\nExperts warn users may still be able to get around such “geoblocks” through a VPN. It is also not clear in which countries such restrictions will be implemented.\n\nIn Malaysia, the communications minister, Fahmi Fadzil, has said restrictions on Grok would only be lifted once the ability to produce harmful content had been disabled, according to local media reports.\n\nDr Nuurrianti Jalli, a visiting fellow at the media, technology and society programme at ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, said the threat of blocking Grok could be a useful way to apply pressure to companies to respond quickly, adding that it “shifts the debate from ‘individual bad actors’ to questions of platform responsibility, safety by design, and accountability when safeguards fail”. It could also “slow the spread of abuse, reduce casual misuse and create a clear boundary around what authorities consider unacceptable”, she said.\n\nIn Indonesia, Grok has been used to create nonconsensual sexualised images of singers and celebrities, including one of the country’s most popular girl groups, JKT48, while in Malaysia, women report similar abuses, including cases where the tool has been used to remove their hijabs, according to Malaysian media.\n\nSome women resorted to publicly telling Grok on X that they do not authorise it to “crawl, take, process or edit” any of their photos.\n\nJalli said governments should push for greater transparency “about how safety measures are implemented, how abuse reports are handled and what enforcement steps are taken when harmful content is generated or circulated”.\n\nThe Malaysian communications and multimedia commission and the ministry of communications did not respond to a request for comment. Indonesia’s ministry of communication and digital affairs also did not respond.\n\nNwachukwu said safeguards should be built into the AI system, rather than “gates” built around it. “Both the [geographic] restriction from X, [and] the restriction from the government is gated access, and gates can be broken down,” she said.\n\nAdditional reporting from Hidayatullah",

    "fullText": "Our reviewer loved this wake-up light more than any other he’s tested – it’s even knocked his previous best sunrise alarm off the top spot\n\nRead the full ranking in our sunrise alarm clock test\n\nSince I first tested sunrise alarm clocks last winter, I’ve come to suspect that there’s no such thing as getting up on the wrong side of bed. What we ought to be worried about is waking up on the wrong side of dawn.\n\nDuring summer (and other times of the year, for late risers), the sunrise begins to rouse us before we wake up. The brain kicks into gear and sends signals to initiate all sorts of bodily processes, from metabolism to hormone release, which helps us to feel ready for the day. It’s a fundament of our circadian rhythm – and we miss out on it whenever we wake before it gets light.\n\nThat is where a sunrise alarm clock can fill the gap. These devices simulate dawn, glowing with increasing brightness in the run-up to your alarm, and for many this reduces grogginess and improves alertness upon waking. I’ve tested more than a dozen models – and I believe the Lumie Bodyclock Glow 150 is the best you can get.\n\nI test sunrise alarm clocks by using them to wake me up before dawn over at least a few nights – which is no hardship at this time of year. I’ve risen with the Bodyclock Glow 150 every day for two weeks, which has given me a fuller impression of its performance. As well as using it as a wake-up light, I’ve tested its sunset simulation mode and used it as a reading light before bedtime.\n\nLumie has seven sunrise alarm clock models, from the basic (but very good) Sunrise Alarm (RRP £49.98, now £38.48) to the elaborate Bodyclock Deluxe 750DAB (RRP £229, now £176.33), which moonlights as a digital radio.\n\nWith a £119 RRP (currently £106.49 at Healf), the Bodyclock Glow 150 is around the middle of the range – but in my view, it has all the features that matter. To help you wake up or drift off, there are programmable sunrise and sunset simulations, which progress through a naturalistic colour spectrum from reddish-orange to brilliant white (and vice versa).\n\nYou can adjust various parameters of these cycles, including their duration, maximum brightness, and – for sunrise mode – the alarm tone that will make sure you’re awake. There are 10 sounds, including birdsong, lapping waves and a shrill beep.\n\nThe device is controlled via buttons surrounding the digital display, which can automatically dim itself when darkness falls. It works as a reading light/night light, has a tap-to-snooze function, and features a cable management space on its underside.\n\nLumie is uniquely placed among sunrise alarm clock brands, having invented this category of product in 1992 as an offshoot of its existing Sad lamp range. Its original wake-up light, the Natural Alarm Clock, looked like an Edwardian space weapon, but later models successfully wed Lumie’s rigorous approach to dawn simulation with a more bedside-friendly design.\n\nLike most (but not all) Lumie wake-up lights, the Bodyclock Glow 150 is certified as a medical device.\n\nMedical certification: UK MDR 2002 and EU MDR 2017/745\n\nSunrise duration: 20, 30 or 45 minutes\n\nSunset duration: 20, 30 or 45 minutes\n\nDimensions: 19 x 12 x 16cm (WDH)\n\nExtra features: tap to snooze; auto-dimming digital display; cable management in base\n\nWhere better to start than the sunrise? The Bodyclock Glow 150 has exceptional sunrise simulation – superior to other brands and equal to other great Lumie models such as the Bodyclock Spark 100. Waking up before dawn, I experience a sensation that’s genuinely close to being bathed in sunlight because the device glows brighter (and lighter in hue) as your alarm time approaches. It has consistently helped me to wake up feeling more alert, in a better mood and less groggy.\n\nThis model surpasses the Spark 100 in its selection of wake-up sounds, several of which are lilting. For very reluctant risers and deep sleepers, there’s also a harsher-sounding alarm tone that’s sure to get your cortisol pumping. You can adjust the sunrise (or sunset) duration, too, with 20-, 30- and 45-minute periods to choose from. I found myself using a 30-minute sunrise most days, but switching to 20 minutes when I had limited time available for sleep.\n\nThe sunset simulation created a relaxing ambience as I wound down for sleep, with the light steadily growing dimmer and graduating from white to reddish-orange as the minutes marched on. However, I tend to read in bed until I conk out, so I preferred using a steady, low-light setting for as long as I needed it instead.\n\nControlling the Glow 150 is straightforward and intuitive, with every option configurable via five buttons on the front of the device (plus an extra one tucked away in the base that toggles the digital display’s automatic night-time shut-off).\n\nAs with most sunrise alarm clocks, the Glow 150 spends most of the day just sitting at the bedside, telling the time and acting as a lamp. It does a nice job of it, too, with a highly legible digital display and a finely adjustable bedside lamp mode that offers the ideal mellow lighting for bedtime reading.\n\nAnother plus: it’s lightweight and compact. I went on a short holiday while testing it and had no problem fitting it inside my suitcase, carrying it and setting it up in my hotel room. This is the sort of thing you may actually find yourself doing if you become habituated to using a wake-up light.\n\nThis is a nicely designed alarm clock, but I’ve tested models with greater bedside appeal (including some cheaper ones). Available only in black, this blobject will suit some bedrooms better than others. If other colours were offered, the Glow 150 would be able to blend more easily into a wider range of interiors.\n\nThere’s also slightly less adjustability with this model than with some competing sunrise alarm clocks, especially in terms of the sunrise length, where the choice of three durations may feel limiting to some.\n\nMy only full-blown reservation is with the steep price (from £106.49 at the time of writing), but think of it as a real investment in your quality of sleep.\n\nSunrise alarm clocks don’t suit everyone, but for many people – myself included – dawn simulation makes a significant difference to the experience of waking up before sunrise. The Bodyclock Glow 150 is the best model I’ve tested, and although it’s expensive, it could prove precious to many who feel groggy in the mornings. Lumie offers a 45-day trial on its wake-up lights, but bear in mind that you’ll need to have all the original packaging (and pay for postage) if you wish to return it within that period.\n\nFor more, read the most-hyped sleep aids, tested",

    "fullText": "Big tech treats our attention like a resource to be mercilessly extracted. The fightback begins here\n\nIn the last 15 years, a linked series of unprecedented technologies have changed the experience of personhood across most of the world. It is estimated that nearly 70% of the human population of the Earth currently possesses a smartphone, and these devices constitute about 95% of internet access-points on the planet. Globally, on average, people seem to spend close to half their waking hours looking at screens, and among young people in the rich world the number is a good deal higher than that.\n\nHistory teaches that new technologies always make possible new forms of exploitation, and this basic fact has been spectacularly exemplified by the rise of society-scale digital platforms. It has been driven by a remarkable new way of extracting money from human beings: call it “human fracking”. Just as petroleum frackers pump high-pressure, high-volume detergents into the ground to force a little monetisable black gold to the surface, human frackers pump high-pressure, high-volume detergent into our faces (in the form of endless streams of addictive slop and maximally disruptive user-generated content), to force a slurry of human attention to the surface, where they can collect it, and take it to market.\n\nFracking (of the Earth and of our minds) produces tectonic instability, toxicity and the despoliation of our landscapes, natural and social. We now know that the heedless exploitation of our external environment has been so relentless and irresponsible that human survival on Earth has been placed in actual jeopardy. The new “gold rush” into the inner environment of the human psyche is well on its way to effecting parallel, if even more insidious destruction.\n\nThe stakes are existential. And that is because, rightly understood, our actual human “attention” – the thing the frackers want, in the form of our eyes on their screens – is nothing less than our ability to care, our ability to think, our ability to give our minds, time and senses to ourselves, the world and each other. To commodify that is to commodify our very beings. The problem isn’t “phones”, and it isn’t “social media”. The problem is human fracking, a world-spanning land-grab into human consciousness – which big tech is treating as a vast, unclaimed territory, ripe for sacking and empire.\n\nThat’s the bad news. The good news is that novel forms of exploitation produce novel forms of resistance. What fills the coffers of the six largest corporations on the planet is nothing other than the stuff of our humanity. Which is to say this new fight for our attention stands in a long line of clashes between those who are willing to reduce people (their labour, their eyeballs) to cash value and those who insist on a higher view of human flourishing. This history is long and complex, and often painful. But it tells us this much: we can fight back. Indeed, we must.\n\nSo what is to be done about this new kind of human exploitation that is harming us – harming children and adults, compromising our deliberative politics and our psychological wellbeing? Regulatory efforts are piecemeal and actively thwarted by the powerful interests in play. Psychopharmacological fixes for the ever-expanding damage merely monetise the destruction in a complementary way and render us better able to submit to conditions that are palpably at odds with human flourishing. How to confront a problem that is both unspeakably intimate and unthinkably extensive?\n\nThe answer is clear: we, the actual people of this planet, must come together in decisive solidarity; we must say no to the human frackers, and do so by insisting, in new ways, that human attention is human, and it is ours, and we will use it to make the worlds in which we want to live. In other words, we need a movement.\n\nThink that sounds quixotic? Well, keep in mind that’s how actual change actually happens. And it can happen fast. The environmental movement as we know it did not exist in 1950, but by 1970 it was a global force. In 1946 Reynolds Tobacco was using doctors to promote cigarettes. Fewer than 20 years later, the American Medical Association and the US surgeon general publicly averred that smoking caused lung cancer.\n\nAnd the changes get much bigger than that. Precious few do-gooders devoted themselves to environmental politics in 1925. That’s because “environmental politics” wasn’t even a thing. It took a cultural shift (and the work of advocates such as Rachel Carson) across the mid-20th century to establish the physical environment – the unity of land, water, and air that produces shared life – as a politically tractable object around which diverse groups could organise. This is to say that the very structures of politics, not just our beliefs and hopes, are themselves emergent forms. New things come into being, and old things pass away.\n\nWhere attention is concerned, there are mounting signs that we are reaching an inflection point. People of all sorts, Maga Republicans and Mamdani progressives, hipsters in Portland and evangelicals in Arkansas – people who don’t agree about anything – all actually do agree that something is totally wrong with a world in which everyone spends nearly all their time scrolling endlessly through the algorithmic feeds of their social media, a world where military-grade technology and trillion-dollar corporations take aim at children, and feed them whatever it takes to keep them hooked.\n\nYou can only abuse people so much, and then, eventually, they turn, they rise, they insist on something else. Already politicians on the right and the left are identifying this issue as one that moves the electorate. In 30 years, we will look back, and this era – the wild west of the tech princes’ smash-and-grab into our hearts, souls and relationships – will be difficult to explain to our grandkids. “How did you all let that happen?” they will ask. And we’ll have to say: “It’s hard to explain: it happened before we noticed; it was so much fun, especially at first; it took us time to figure out what was going on … ”\n\nBut we are figuring it out. We write as representatives of a fast-growing and increasingly well-organised movement, focused on pushing back against the human frackers, and giving shape to a new politics of human attention. At the heart of our efforts? The formation of broad coalitions devoted to the politics of human attention, the practice of diverse forms of study that call forth the life-giving powers of the mind and senses, and the promotion of sanctuary spaces for the protection and cultivation of the kinds of attention that make life good. We call this work attention activism.\n\nOur claim? That all of us already have the tools to resist the frackers, because all of us already have things we do and care about that put us beyond the reach of the algorithms. We all already know the deepest truth: that true human attention isn’t the click and swipe of screen time. True human attention is love, curiosity, daydreaming and taking care of ourselves and others.\n\nYes, new technologies give rise to new kinds of exploitation and resistance. But new forms of exploitation can even give rise to genuinely new forms of politics. You couldn’t brutalise an industrial proletariat before the factory system. Steam engines set the conditions of possibility for this development. They weren’t themselves a “problem”, of course; they gleamed and were precise and powerful. Who could see them operate without awe? But they also created a world in which it was possible to aggregate and extract physical labour from human beings in a revolutionary way. Along the way, they created a new kind of political subject, Homo economicus, a person who had been reduced, in the calculus of modernity, to “labuor value”. Actual revolutions followed – and a new kind of politics was born which reflected a new world of industrial labour, and new forms of labour solidarity, such as unions and workers’ parties.\n\nThe new system of human fracking is turning all of us into attentional subjects in a powerful new way. Homo attentus is the end user of every networked system – economic, political, expressive. With this new form of life comes, as we have discovered, appalling new vulnerability. But we are on the brink of understanding the new power that has come into our hands in the fracklands. We believe a new kind of politics beckons. What will it look like? It is hard to say. And there are reasons to be fearful. But if we, the people, can take up the banner of a new kind of freedom movement – a movement for the true freedom of attention itself, what we call attensity – and deploy our truly human attention in new ways, with a new understanding of the stakes, we can defy the frackers, and insist on creating, together, a human world.\n\nD Graham Burnett is professor of history at Princeton University.

    "fullText": "Over the next few months leading up to the April 15 deadline, people across the United States will be filing their federal income taxes. When they do, it sounds like many Americans could be in for a pleasant surprise.\n\nOver the past few weeks, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who also serves as the acting director of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), has been sharing that many Americans should expect \"gigantic\" and \"very large\" refunds this year as a result of some significant rewrites to the tax law in the United States.\n\nBack in July, the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB) was signed into law, bringing several high-profile changes to the tax code that offer tax relief across a broad range of categories. These changes are expected to impact nearly everyone who will file taxes this year.\n\nThe changes include several high-profile new tax deductions, including an increase in the standard deduction, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on new car interest, and additional tax deductions for seniors.\n\nThese changes are expected to cut taxes for many individuals throughout the United States, particularly in the middle and upper-middle classes.\n\nFollowing these tax changes, it sounds like Americans can expect significantly larger tax returns this year compared to previous years. Bessent has described the expected refunds as \"gigantic\" and \"very large\" on separate occasions.\n\nBessent expects that households throughout the United States could see \"$1,000, $2,000 refunds\" on average.\n\nThe White House has cited recent research from the financial services firm Piper Sandler indicating that the refund check could increase by $1,000 compared to the 2025 filing season.\n\nThe reason for the inflated tax refunds, Bessent explains, is that the tax changes were retroactive, applying to all of 2025 even though the bill was not passed until July. As a result, the vast majority of working Americans did not update their tax withholding to account for this, leading to significant refunds.\n\n\"The bill was passed in July, working Americans didn't change their withholding, so they're going to be getting very large refunds in the first quarter,\" Bessent said, via Newsweek. \"So I think we're going to see $100-$150 billion of refunds, which could be between $1,000, $2,000 per household. Then, they'll change their withholding, and they'll get a real increase in their wages.\"\n\nPiper Sandler economist Don Schneider explained that adjusting tax withholding would have been quite difficult, considering the extra provisions like no tax on overtime or no tax on tips.",

    "title": "The post-pandemic era has sent the high-end watch market into a slump that analysts say could last a decade",
    "description": "Industry experts told Business Insider that 2021-2022 was probably the top of the market, and luxury watch prices won't see a similar boom anytime soon.",
    "fullText": "The luxury watch market is coming off a wild sugar high.\n\nAfter what looked like an unstoppable rally in watch prices at the tail end of the pandemic, the market for high-end timepieces has cooled. The corner of the luxury consumer space could also be sluggish for years, with low single-digit growth that pales in comparison to the pandemic era, industry analysts told Business Insider.\n\nThat relative decline has been triggered by a few factors. While people have less time and money on their hands, less flashy, more austere fashion trends rooted in \"Quiet Luxury\" are also having an impact, watch industry insiders said.\n\nSecondhand prices in the luxury watch market have dropped sharply from their highs during the pandemic. The WatchCharts Overall Market Index, a gauge of secondhand luxury watch prices, is down 33% from its peak just after the pandemic, though it is up about 5% over the past year.\n\nHigh-end watches were the worst-performing luxury category last year, according to Claudia D'Arpizio, a partner at consulting firm Bain & Company.\n\nWhile a few dominant brands are seeing some growth — kingmakers like Rolex, Patek Philippe, and Audemars Piguet — virtually all high-end watchmakers in the business are struggling or stagnating at the moment, she said, even those with a \"great heritage\" name.\n\n\"The rest are all facing difficult times,\" she said, speculating that the watch market could continue to normalize and remain broadly weak for several years until the global economy enters a fresh growth cycle.\n\n\"Probably we are near the bottom, but it's really difficult to say,\" she said.\n\nRevenue growth in the broader online jewelry and watch business has collapsed from its 2020 peak. Growth is also expected to remain near zero through the end of the decade, even lower than the average growth rate in the years leading up to the pandemic, according to an estimate from IBISWorld.\n\nOliver Müller, a longtime consultant in the luxury watch business and the founder of LuxeConsult, said he believed 2021 and 2022 were likely the best-ever years for the watch market, with the industry unlikely to achieve a similar growth rate in the foreseeable future.\n\nHe attributed the post-COVID bubble to a unique cocktail of circumstances that pushed newcomers into the watch market — mainly, people having extra time on their hands to get into new hobbies, and the fact that crypto markets and meme stocks were delivering big gains in very little time for many traders.\n\n\"The crypto boys, as they call them, all of a sudden discovered that there was something called watches on which they could flip a lot of money,\" he said, referring to the practice of traders buying high-end watches to quickly resell them at a profit on the secondhand market.\n\n\"I don't think we will get back anytime soon to those crazy high prices that we have seen,\" he said.\n\nAndrew Morgan, another watch consultant, said he believed the market reached its zenith in 2022.\n\n\"I think to get to those prices, again, we're talking decades,\" he said, speculating that the market would only see \"shallow\" growth from here on out.\n\nThe pandemic-era watch vibe was marked by \"flashy\" styles and special edition models that flew off the shelves, D'Arpizio said. The buying spree was largely driven by ultrawealthy clients who were sitting on big gains on their investments and were willing to splurge.\n\nMany speculators in the market at the time also seemed to be interested in integrated or stainless steel sports watches, styles that tend to be associated with \"over wealth.\"\n\n\"Luxury watches got swept up as part of this whole affluent luxury, Instagram lifestyle,\" Morgan said.\n\nFor luxury watches, it seems to have kicked off a new era: one defined less by excess and more by refinement, D'Arpizio and Morgan said.\n\nThough there are exceptions, the worst-performing models on the market tend to be integrated and stainless-steel sports watches, Morgan said. While models from leading brands are still reaping a \"mild\" return on the secondary market, models from most other brands face a \"significant depreciation\" the minute they're sold, he said.\n\n\"Some of those really spiky hype watches have calmed down, and are continuing to calm down,\" Morgan said of watches that contributed to the pandemic spike. \"Collectors of classy reserve time pieces will still purchase those, but the reasoning for purchasing them has become more about a personal self-reflecting sense of achievement, rather than a publicly broadcast sense of self-achievement, if that makes sense.\"\n\nIt's difficult to equate \"quiet luxury\" with the watch market, since watches are by definition a status symbol, D'Arpizio. But she agrees a more \"conservative\" style has proliferated, with most consumers now focusing on classic pieces from timeless brands — something that can be worn again and again.\n\n\"These SKUs are superstars and very recognizable, so they are not really quiet, but for sure the model stays, and the value stays,\" she said of the more understated vibe among shoppers. \"They don't want to make a mistake, so they choose the safe side.\"",

    "title": "We spent $145 to eat like finance bros at Tommy Bahama and are shocked to admit we get the appeal — but not the food",
    "description": "Tommy Bahama's restaurant is popular for a business lunch. We ate there to see why — and left simultaneously underwhelmed and somewhat sold.",
    "fullText": "The Tommy Bahama on 45th Street and 5th Avenue bills itself on its website as \"an oasis in the big city,\" a \"refuge\" that's \"ideal for business lunches.\" Geographically, it makes total sense — on foot, Tommy Bahama is six minutes from JPMorgan's new tower, nine minutes from Bank of America Tower, five minutes from a PWC building, and 12 minutes from the main Morgan Stanley office.\n\nWe'll spare you the full list of adjacent corporate headquarters.\n\nWe had a 12:30 p.m. reservation, and the restaurant kept filling up throughout our meal. Diners eventually sat at the bar, and when I, Alice, went to the bathroom around 1:20 p.m., a gaggle of waiters was congregating by the kitchen, discussing table numbers over a window crammed with burgers and salads.\n\nApart from the kitchen, though, the crowded restaurant didn't feel cramped. Tables were far enough apart that we couldn't hear others' conversations, yet the background din of conversation made the room feel lively. The only deal talk we overheard came from a woman on her way out, who mentioned her interest in bringing ESRT, the company that owns the Empire State Building, on as a client.\n\nSo when it comes to layout, it's not a bad spot for a semi-private, relatively casual business lunch.\n\nFor a restaurant in Midtown Manhattan, the price point wasn't too surprising, but it seemed more suited to dinner than lunch. The cheapest item in the entrée section was $31.\n\nOne table of four almost entirely ordered the macadamia-nut-crusted fresh catch, and our waitress said the ahi tuna poke bowl was also a popular lunch choice. There were also a number of salad orders around the restaurant, which seemed fitting for lunch.\n\nThe $23 \"world-famous\" coconut shrimp appetizer arrived at our table fairly quickly — it was the only item we knew we had to try during our visit.\n\nThe shrimp sat atop a papaya and mango chutney, adding another layer of sweetness to the coconut coating. The cabbage salad that sat on top was our favorite part of the plate. The coleslaw was dressed with a light vinaigrette, and the cilantro added a nice freshness.\n\nUltimately, though, the overall dish was too sweet for our liking, and we left some lonely shrimp on the plate.\n\nI, Jordan, admit that I'm a newbie to ordering French dip sandwiches. I was expecting mine to come with caramelized onions and Swiss cheese. For $33, the Tommy Bahama wagyu French dip came with neither, despite the description listing sweet-and-sour onions as an ingredient.\n\nThe missing onions aside, I found myself taking some of the sliced beef off to make the sandwich a little easier to bite into. I felt kind of silly picking the valuable wagyu out of my sandwich, but I wanted to be able to close it properly. The broth was good for dipping, but I was left wanting more thinly sliced beef and additional ingredients.\n\nOur waitress surprised us with two free desserts: the piña colada cake and malted chocolate pie.\n\nThe cake was incredibly sweet, and we initially didn't realize it had any pineapple, but the whipped cream was, unsurprisingly, fantastic. Jordan said the chocolate pie was the only dish that tasted exactly as it looked. An Oreo crust is rarely a bad thing, but we agreed we wouldn't order it again.\n\nFor $145, we were sufficiently underwhelmed by the food. Then again, everyone else around us seemed pretty pleased, and the service is efficient without feeling rushed.\n\nAs a Wall Street go-to, Tommy Bahama presents a funny inverse. Many firms are setting up outposts in the south, namely in Texas, but the beachy restaurant is trying to bring southern, Floridian charm to 45th Street. And it is, at times, easy to forget that you're in the middle of Manhattan while sitting in the palm-filled dining room, until you look out the window, or at the guys in Charles Tyrwhitt vests sitting next to you.\n\nThe noise level and layout are conducive to a genuinely productive, laid-back business meal, and it's an easy escape from Manhattan's chaos. Provided you like the food, we see how it could become an unlikely power lunch staple.\n\nThe price is comparable to that of a steakhouse dinner, but it's nothing the corporate card can't handle, right?",

    "title": "I founded a wellness startup after leaving McKinsey. Hustle culture is a liability, not an asset.",
    "description": "Cesar Carvalho founded Wellhub, a corporate wellness platform. This is how he thinks companies should approach employee wellbeing.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Cesar Carvalho, the CEO and cofounder of Wellhub, a global corporate wellness platform. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI became interested in consulting through some older friends while studying at the University of São Paulo in Brazil. Their stories about how fast you could learn and grow in the career made me want to pursue it.\n\nI applied to all the top firms and accepted McKinsey's offer to be a business analyst in 2010 as soon as I received it. It was the best thing I could imagine as a long-term career.\n\nI was at McKinsey for about two years before they encouraged me to pursue an MBA. At that time in Brazil, you could only become an associate or a manager if you had one.\n\nI applied to Harvard Business School with the intention of returning to McKinsey and continuing the consulting journey. But the summer of my first year in Boston, I had the idea of starting WellHub.\n\nThe working environment at McKinsey was super intense. I would do an average of 10 to 12 hours a day, and when there was a crunch, it could be more.\n\nAs a consultant, I often traveled to different cities or juggled between a client's office and McKinsey's office. There were no gym memberships that provided access to facilities in different locations.\n\nIf I were at a client site and had two hours before my next meeting, I would have nothing to do but extra work. I had three gym memberships that were going unused, and I wanted to feel less stressed and improve my well-being.\n\nMy experience showed me there was a need for busy workers to get convenient access to health and well-being. And I quickly realized that was true not just for CEOs, bankers, and consultants, but also for FedEx drivers and grocery store workers.\n\nIt's now been 14 years since I started Wellhub.\n\nWe're now in 18 countries, and partner with 40,000 companies to offer wellness to their employees, including many McKinsey offices. 5 million employees engage with Wellhub every month.\n\nWith Wellhub, employees can book a class regardless of the country or city they are in, without needing a membership for a specific gym or studio. Companies pay a fixed monthly fee based on their employee count, and employees also contribute.\n\nI grew a lot at McKinsey, and that was especially thanks to one thing — in two years, I worked under seven different partners, all with their own managing style.\n\nIt could change everything: the team culture, the hours you're putting in, and the work you prioritize. I quickly learned what worked well for me, and what didn't.\n\nThe best experiences I had were when we were given flexibility. Some leaders used a process I always use today: a kickoff meeting in which every single employee is given the opportunity to talk about their own boundaries and how they operate.\n\nManagers with families would say their ideal schedule was to go home early, eat with their families, and then log back on if needed. My own boundary at McKinsey was that I was willing to work as much as needed during the week, but my weekends were sacred. During my two years at the company, I worked only four or five weekends.\n\nI learned that when expectations are clear and leaders are good enough to ask and respect the boundaries of employees, you can get everything done and still have great morale.\n\nI also made a ton of friends, and those connections became really important. My Wellhub cofounder and several colleagues worked at McKinsey with me, and two of my seven angel investors were my previous bosses.\n\nCompanies benefit from having employees who are active and in a great state of well-being.\n\nIf companies don't support well-being, they won't just be less productive — they'll also have higher costs than peers who do invest in it.\n\nIt impacts the amount of sick leave and PTO people take, and plays into retention and attraction.\n\nThe trend some corporate companies have taken towards hardcore culture is completely insane. Hustle culture is a liability, not an asset.\n\nMany CEOs are missing the mark, and the consequences will show up as companies underperform those that take a more balanced approach. Hustle culture leads to burnout, and it pushes great people out before they would otherwise leave.\n\nAs a CEO, I believe in treating every employee like an adult and trusting them. My focus is always on getting the work done — not how many hours it takes or whether someone is showing up to the office.\n\nWhen I meet coworkers, we typically do a yoga session or a workout, instead of going to bars or restaurants. If you switch a happy hour for a wellness hour, and build healthy habits into everyday routines, you can improve well-being across a company.\n\nTo me, well-being means being productive, healthy, and happy. I put productive there because it means that happiness and health are being put to good use.\n\nI want to be a great CEO to my employees, want to inspire our clients and partners to join the movement, but more importantly, I want to be a great dad to my three kids, and a great husband to my wife.\n\nMy solution is integrating life and work. You don't need to be sacrificing your marriage or family for success.\n\nWhen people ask me, \"What are your hours?\" I say, \"I'm working all the time. I'm thinking about work when I'm exercising.\"\n\nI have also built rituals in my well-being journey that I almost never break.\n\nWhenever I'm traveling, I call my kids at 7:30 p.m. no matter what — even if that means setting an alarm for 2 a.m. It's a way for me to be close to them, no matter where I am.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career as a consultant?

    "description": "Cassindy Chao had a career spanning JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, but never felt she thrived. Now she's a matchmaker, and feels 100% more fulfilled.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Cassindy Chao, 57, a matchmaker based in the Bay Area. This piece has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nFinance is a young person's arena. Long hours and stamina are treated as essential markers of a coveted hire. As I got older, I found myself wondering where that left someone like me: a middle-aged mom of three.\n\nI couldn't control getting older, so in 2022, at the age of 54, I became a full-time matchmaker.\n\nFor the first time in my career, my age is an asset.\n\nI'm American-born Chinese, and in families like mine, there's often a plan: get good grades, attend a reputable school, and secure a respectable job. My parents wanted me to pursue a career in medicine, but because I struggled with chemistry. I went to Wellesley and majored in Chinese studies and economics.\n\nIn my sophomore year, I became involved with the Asian Association's blind-date semi-formal. I had a lot of fun, even though I made some of the worst matches back then.\n\nI was so engrossed by match-matching that I started organizing the semi-formal event during classes and even dropping classes to focus on it. I never imagined it could be a career.\n\nI graduated in 1990 and got a job at an investment bank. I loved art and creative work, but I needed a career that paid well because I wanted to send money to my parents. I got rejection after rejection from JPMorgan in New York, but as Asia boomed in 1993, being fluent in Mandarin became an advantage, and I got a job in the Hong Kong office\n\nA year in, Goldman Sachs offered me a role in Hong Kong as well. The culture was one of working hard and playing hard, ultracompetitive, yet tight-knit. You made close friends because you were working late nights together on deals.\n\nWorking at Goldman was addictive: I was getting paid a lot, traveling, and generally having a lot of fun, but I struggled with the numbers, and writing reports never came easily to me.\n\nI also found myself sacrificing my energy, creativity, and life to fulfill the needs of an organization. Deals were time-sensitive, people are accustomed to quick turnaround times, and it was all-hands-on-deck for various projects.\n\nIt takes a lot out of you, and I remember my mom telling me that if I stayed at Goldman Sachs, I'd never get married. I think she was right.\n\nIn May 1999, after five years at Goldman Sachs, I returned to California and got married soon after. My mom was sick at the time, and as painful as that period was, it forced me to stop and assess where I was going and what came next.\n\nIt became clear that investment banking was not where I thrived.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2016, I worked on various projects in financial consulting: I was helping close companies for VCs and businesses manage their overseas operations.\n\nI had to draw boundaries around my time because it was intense, but the pay was good.\n\nIn 2013, I read an article in a magazine about a matchmaker in Chicago. I had no idea that it could be a career, and I read loads of books on the topic.\n\nIn 2015, I trained with a matchmaker and initially did it as a side hustle, which I publicized by building a website and emailing my network — long before I understood the power of a proper newsletter.\n\nIn 2021, I attended my first matchmakers' conference, where I learned tips and tricks from seasoned professionals. It helped me build my business through word of mouth, and I became a full-time matchmaker in 2022.\n\nAs a middle-aged woman with caring responsibilities, it works great. I drive the business and get to do what I want, how I want, when I want. I love the independence.\n\nThe best part of my job is facilitating an unexpected match — finding love for people who would otherwise never have met. Another great aspect of my work is that I constantly talk to younger people. I learn a lot from them, and they give me new perspectives.\n\nOne of the biggest fears around ageism is becoming irrelevant or out of touch, but that hasn't been my experience. The younger people I work with teach me about things like SEO and PR, and in return, I share the perspective and wisdom I've gained over the years.\n\nI feel 100% more fulfilled than I did in my previous career, and it will remain sustainable as I age.\n\nGetting older doesn't matter. In fact, the older I get, the better because, after all, it means I'm wiser.",

    "description": "The Alexander brothers' New York sex trafficking trial is scheduled to kick off with jury selection in a Manhattan federal court on Tuesday.",
    "fullText": "Brothers Tal and Oren Alexander — once among the nation's top luxury real estate brokers — along with a third brother, are set to stand trial in Manhattan this week over allegations that the trio operated a long-running sex-trafficking scheme.\n\nJury selection in the federal criminal trial is scheduled to kick off Tuesday in the same 26th-floor courtroom where last year Sean \"Diddy\" Combs was cleared of the top sex trafficking and racketeering counts against him and convicted of lesser prostitution-related charges.\n\nThe case against the Alexander brothers marks the Department of Justice's latest high-profile sex-trafficking prosecution to reach trial since the Combs case. In the aftermath of the hip-hop mogul's trial, an attorney for Tal Alexander hailed the Combs verdict as both \"refreshing\" and \"heartening\" to Business Insider.\n\nTal, Oren, and Oren's twin, Alon Alexander, who was an executive at his family's private security firm, have vehemently denied the sex crimes charges against them, as well as all other allegations. They've been locked up at a notorious federal jail in Brooklyn since their December 2024 arrest in Miami.\n\nThe FBI began investigating the Alexander brothers after The Real Deal first reported in June of that year that two women had filed civil lawsuits against Oren and Alon Alexander, accusing them of rape. Those lawsuits sparked a wave of additional allegations against the brothers.\n\nAttorneys for the three brothers did not respond to requests for comment by Business Insider for this story.\n\n\"The brothers were young adults navigating social situations that may not have been perfect,\" a spokesperson for the Alexanders, Juda Engelmayer, told Business Insider, \"but that is not criminal conduct and bears no resemblance to trafficking.\"\n\nIf convicted at trial, the three brothers, who are 38 and 39, could face up to life behind bars.\n\nManhattan federal prosecutors, in court papers, have accused the Alexander brothers of working together and with others to drug, sexually assault, and rape dozens of women over more than a decade in posh locales like the Hamptons, Miami, and Manhattan.\n\nProsecutors have said in court filings that several attacks happened at Hamptons mansions, while another was aboard a Bahamian-flagged cruise ship.\n\nThe Alexander brothers face 12 felony counts, including conspiracy to commit sex trafficking and sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion, according to a superseding indictment filed last week. The indictment ties the charges to eight accusers, including two who were minors.\n\nThe superseding indictment also accuses Oren Alexander of recording himself and another person \"engaging in sexual activity with a incapacitated 17-year-old girl in Manhattan.\"\n\nThe government's case rests on allegations that the Alexanders used their wealth and prominent positions \"to create and facilitate opportunities to rape and sexually assault female victims\" in a scheme that ran from roughly 2008 to 2021.\n\nOren and Tal Alexander began their real estate careers at Douglas Elliman before launching their own brokerage, Official, in 2022.\n\nProsecutors said the Alexanders sometimes planned sexual assaults in advance, luring victims to locations with the \"promise of luxury experiences, travel, and accommodations.\" Other times, the Alexander brothers chose their victims by chance, prosecutors allege.\n\nProsecutors said that ahead of the sex attacks, the brothers \"shared photographs of women and girls to select those they found sufficiently attractive to invite.\"\n\n\"The defendants and other men attending the trips pooled financial resources in order to pay for flights and other travel expenses for the women and girls,\" prosecutors have said in court papers.\n\nIt will ultimately be up to the jury to decide whether the brothers are guilty of the sex trafficking charges they face.\n\nDefense attorneys for the brothers have argued in court documents that the government overreached by bringing federal sex trafficking charges because the statute requires a \"commercial sex act\" that the indictment failed to allege.\n\n\"The Government alleges, as the 'thing of value,' that Defendants 'lured' their victims with 'promises of luxury experiences, travel, and accommodations.' But that is not enough to establish a 'commercial sex act,'\" defense attorneys for Tal Alexander wrote in a June motion to dismiss, which the other brothers joined.\n\nThe lawyers wrote that the accusers did not provide sex \"on account of\" those promises \"as the statute requires.\" They added that the travel and accommodations \"did not represent compensation for the sex acts.\"\n\nThe defense lawyers argued that the government's effort to frame the brothers' alleged conduct as federal sex trafficking \"rests on a dangerously overbroad theory—one that would, if accepted, convert nearly any accusation of date rape into a federal sex trafficking offense.\"",

    "fullText": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Thousands of people gathered Saturday at San Francisco’s Civic Center to celebrate the life of Bob Weir, the legendary guitarist and founding member of the Grateful Dead who died last week at age 78.\n\nMusicians Joan Baez and John Mayer spoke on a makeshift stage in front of the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium after four Buddhist monks opened the event with a prayer in Tibetan. Fans carried long-stemmed red roses, placing some at an altar filled with photos and candles. They wrote notes on colored paper, professing their love and thanking him for the journey.\n\nSeveral asked him to say hello to fellow singer and guitarist Jerry Garcia and bass guitarist Phil Lesh, also founding members who preceded him in death. Garcia died in 1995; Lesh died in 2024.\n\n“I’m here to celebrate Bob Weir,” said Ruthie Garcia, who is no relation to Jerry, a fan since 1989. “Celebrating him and helping him go home.”\n\nSaturday’s celebration brought plenty of fans with long dreadlocks and wearing tie-dye clothing, some using walkers. But there were also young couples, men in their 20s and a father who brought his 6-year-old son in order to pass on to the next generation a love of live music and the tight-knit Deadhead community.\n\nThe Bay Area native joined the Grateful Dead — originally the Warlocks — in 1965 in San Francisco at just 17 years old. He wrote or co-wrote and sang lead vocals on Dead classics including “Sugar Magnolia,” “One More Saturday Night” and “Mexicali Blues.” He was generally considered less shaggy looking than the other band members, although he adopted a long beard like Garcia’s later in life.\n\nThe Dead played music that pulled in blues, jazz, country, folk and psychedelia in long improvisational jams. Their concerts attracted avid Deadheads who followed them on tours. The band played on decades after Garcia’s death, morphing into Dead & Company with John Mayer.\n\nDarla Sagos, who caught an early flight out of Seattle Saturday morning to make the public mourning, said she suspected something was up when there were no new gigs announced after Dead & Company played three nights in San Francisco last summer. It was unusual, as his calendar often showed where he would be playing next.\n\n“We were hoping that everything was OK and that we were going to get more music from him,” she said. “But we will continue the music, with all of us and everyone that’s going to be playing it.”\n\nSagos and her husband, Adam Sagos, have a one-year-old grandson who will grow up knowing the music.\n\nA statement on Weir’s Instagram account announced his passing Jan. 10. It said he beat cancer, but he succumbed to underlying lung issues. He is survived by his wife and two daughters, who were at Saturday’s event.\n\nHis death was sudden and unexpected, said daughter Monet Weir, but he had always wished for the music and the legacy of the Dead to outlast him.\n\nAmerican music, he believed, could unite, she said.\n\n“The show must go on,” Monet Weir said.",

    "fullText": "The hosts of The Big Weekend Show on Fox News were shocked and disgusted to learn that anti-ICE protesters in Minnesota were using Grindr and other dating apps to “expose” ICE agents.\n\nFox News highlighted a Saturday report from the New York Post on “lefty TikTokers” who are calling on their comrades to “get those d*ck pics and selfies and share them widely,” as one user put it.\n\nThat same TikTok user told her “gay friends in Minneapolis on Grindr” to be on high alert for ICE agents “because you know that [the app is] blowing up right now with all of the visitors from out of town and I bet you could get some pretty good info.”\n\nAnother user urged her fellow anti-ICE Minnesotans to send screenshots of agents on Bumble and other dating apps; she said she was compiling a folder full of details on ICE agents and needed as much ammo as she could get.\n\nThe Big Weekend Show showed clips of those women making their pleas before getting the panel’s reaction.\n\n“Are they trying to shame federal agents who may be homosexual? They always bring their own arguments full circle—” co-host Joey Jones started to ask before Fox News contributor David Webb jumped in.\n\n“Let me ask the left — what do you have against homosexuals or somebody whose gay if they happen to be in law enforcement?” Webb asked. “You gonna out them?”\n\nWebb said Minnesotans would be better off if ICE “unmasked all of these rioters, these people who are out there protecting criminals [and] committing crimes.”\n\nBeyond patrolling Grindr, protesters have been demonstrating against — and in some cases “physically” interfering with — ICE raids following the shooting death of Renee Good.\n\nA moment later, Jones said it was sick that lefty Minnesotans want to “want to go after the individual, not the job they’re doing or the policy that Congress passed.”\n\nFox News senior correspondent Alicia Acuna agreed, saying the protesters have their priorities backwards.\n\n“They don’t come out and shame the violent criminals who have been arrested, who are in this country illegally and victimized so many people,” Acuna said. “They have no shame.”\n\nThe post ‘What Do You Have Against Homosexuals?’ Fox News Hosts Shocked By Minnesota Protestors Exposing ICE Agents on Grindr first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "\"100% Spanish\" and \"100% Moroccan\" - Africa Cup of Nations final awaits Brahim Diaz, who has become an icon and the symbol of a modern and ambitious Morocco.",
    "fullText": "Brahim Diaz was born in Malaga but has become a national icon for Morocco as they chase a second Africa Cup of Nations title on Sunday.\n\nThe 26-year-old Real Madrid forward - who made one senior appearance for Spain - switched allegiances to Morocco in 2023 and is the top scorer at this year's Afcon.\n\nDiaz's mother, Patricia, hails from Malaga, a city like most of those by the sea, shaped by movement across cultures. His father, Sufiel, was born in Melilla - a Spanish city on the north African coast - into a Moroccan family. From early on, Brahim grew up understanding that identity does not need to be singular.\n\nAs a child, he travelled several times to Nador to visit his grandmother and cousins. There, he was dressed like any other Moroccan boy. In family photos he appears next to his grandmother, wearing a traditional Moroccan veil. Brahim has often summed it up simply: \"I have always felt 100% Spanish and 100% Moroccan.\"\n\nBefore 11-a-side football, Brahim was shaped by futsal. At four or five years old, he was already learning to survive in tight spaces. That influence remains visible today: close control, dribbling in crowded areas, explosive acceleration, and the ability to strike with the toe when there is no time to adjust.\n\nHe later moved to seven-a-side, playing for modest Malaga-based teams such as Tiro Pichon and Mortadelo. Malaga wanted to sign him when he was just five or six, but his father chose patience: small teams, futsal, learning without rushing.\n\nWhen he eventually joined Malaga and began to stand out - before the age of 16 - Europe took notice. In 2010, at a tournament organised by Spanish radio legend Jose Ramon de la Morena, Brahim was named MVP. His Malaga side were eliminated by Real Madrid in the semi-finals but he left his mark, scoring against Luca Zidane.\n\nManchester City then arrived with a clear, long-term project. Brahim moved to England in 2015. He did not speak English, but education had always been central within the family. A year later he signed his first professional contract. City were no longer just a big club - they had ambition, structure and a globally respected academy. Today, Brahim speaks English fluently and feels he was offered a very strong foundation in Manchester.\n\nWhile many young talents accept early loans, Brahim refused shortcuts. At 17, modest Spanish top-flight clubs wanted him on loan. He said no. In his mind, only one path existed: consistency and elite surroundings. His entire family moved to Manchester with him.\n\nThe next step felt inevitable. In 2019 he joined Real Madrid in a £21m deal - a record fee at the time for a City academy product. The opportunity was irresistible. But his early period in Madrid was disrupted by a series of injuries which prevented him from settling and building continuity at the Bernabeu.\n\nA three-season loan spell at AC Milan followed. There, his career reached a defining moment: wearing the iconic number 10 shirt and playing a decisive role in Milan's Serie A title. He delivered important goals, stood out on big European nights, and showed leadership that went beyond his years and what his slight frame might suggest.\n\nThen came his return to Madrid.",

    "fullText": "SYDNEY, N.S. — American forward Emily Pohl and blueliner Margaret Averill notched two goals and added two assists apiece to help lead the United States handily take the Swedes out of gold medal contention with a 9-1 win Saturday evening at the 2026 IIHF Under-18 Women's World Championship at Centre 200.\n\nForward Jane Daley was one of five other players to put one on the scoreboard for the U.S., making her record-setting 12th goal of this year's tournament, according to the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). She leads all players with 17 points total.\n\nAverill and Pohl opened it up in the first to make it 2-0 going into the first intermission, forwards Jillian McLaughlin and Daley added a couple \n\nThree of those first seven goals were scored on American powerplays, including one on a five-on-three in the second, which included a two-minute interference from defender Ebba Westerlind and a five-minute spearing penalty, that came with a game misconduct, from forward Moa Stridh, served by fourth-liner Greta Johansson, which certainly didn't help the Swedish squad with the game off the ice — and perhaps their mentality on the ice.\n\nThat being said, there were plenty of Swedish fans in the stands in the Cape Breton arena, wearing team jerseys, holding up brightly coloured signs, and cheering them on throughout, but the whoops and hollers were perhaps no louder than when Tilde Grillfors snuck one past American goalkeeper Bianca Birrittieri on a powerplay just over three minutes into the final frame, narrowing the gap to 7-1 for the U.S.\n\nDespite the Swedish support in the crowd, and the goalie change from starter Meja Engelin to Thea Holmberg going into the third period, there just wasn't enough time for the yellow and blue squad to catch up to the visibly stronger American team.\n\nCentre Talla Hansen scored on an Averill assist and winger Lindsay Stephnowski capped it off with help from Pohl to seal the 9-1 deal and earn a berth to Sunday's gold medal game for the United States.\n\nBirrittieri didn't earn the shutout but made a solid 17 stops for the U.S., while Engelin made a respectable 25 saves on 32 shots against. Holmberg saved seven of nine shots in her third-period appearance in the crease.\n\n\"This sucks,\" Swedish captain Ebba Westerlind told reporters matter-of-factly after the tough semifinal loss.\"We compete every time,\" she said, adding, \"the U.S.A. is really good, so we try to do our best.\"\n\n\"I think we did some good things... (but) I felt like they were first on the pucks, especially in the first period,\" she said, but pointed out \"we did better throughout the game.\"\n\nNow that Sweden is moving on from semis, it's time for \"eat, sleep, rest,\" Westerlind said of focusing on what's coming next for her country at U18 women's worlds — a chance to go home with bronze medals around their necks. \"We know we have to do the best we can... and focus on the win.\"\n\nSweden will play for bronze bragging rights earlier Sunday at Centre 200. The Swedes last won a silver medal at the 2023 IIHF Under-18 Women's World Championship, which they hosted in their home country in the northern community Ostersund.\n\nAs for the Americans, four-point contributor Pohl said, \"we don't take any of our opponents lightly.\n\n\"We knew it was going to be a good game, but I think all of us are us are prepared,\" the Woodbury, Minn., native said.\n\n\"Our coaches and teammates do a great job preparing all of us. So, (we) just (to) have fun and smile out there, and play our game that we know how to play.\"\n\nUnited States head coach Courtney Kennedy said her team was \"enjoying the moment\" of the semifinal celebration before turning thoughts to tomorrow's battle for the world championship title.\n\n\"It was a lot of work to get here,\" she said. \"I'm very proud of the players, and I'm proud of the way they played through all three periods of every single game, and it's uphill from here.\n\n\"Whoever wins this next game, we're going to have to prepare and get back to the drawing board about what we need to be successful, and both teams that we could end up playing, they're both fantastic, they're well-coached, and (Sunday) will be a hard, hard game.\"\n\n\"Tomorrow's another day,\" Kennedy said.\n\nEarlier Saturday, Finland beat Slovakia 7-1 in a relegation game, marking the first time the normally top-ranked women's hockey country, which means they'll be moving down a division in the IIHF under-18 international pool.\n\nThe large scoring gaps at this U18 worlds isn't what many fans, or serious women's hoockey watchers, want to see, as international development should be helping close these gaps to ensure competition continues to improve and the game continues to grow worldwide.\n\nSweden faces off in the bronze medal game at 3:30 p.m. AT, while the United States goes for gold at 7:30 p.m. AT.",

    "description": "Trade rumors are one thing, but being booed by your own fans is another. For Giannis Antetokounmpo, the frustration in Milwaukee has hit a new level.",
    "fullText": "Trade rumors are one thing, but being booed by your own fans is another. For Giannis Antetokounmpo, the frustration in Milwaukee has hit a new level. For the third time this season, they have lost three or more games in a row. While this may lead to some discontent, a Bucks assistant coach spills the beans on the issues in the locker room.\n\n“I think we just haven’t bought into everybody being stars in their role consistent enough,” said Rajon Rondo on the KG Certified show. “I think that’s the frustration part. Obviously, you know the big fella missed a lot of games, and you know it’s a big thing about now how we’re trying to be good without Giannis on the court. We may go in spots or lows, whereas two or three possessions where we don’t take care of the ball. That’s where the gap continues to grow.\n\nIt’s magnified now, obviously, because of trade deadlines, rumors here and there; it’s like it’s all magnified. Even though it’s a small market, it’s still the Milwaukee Bucks, and it’s Giannis’ team. So we’re going through it, but as I said, it’s the NBA grind; you can’t win a championship. But again, I just think we do have some great pieces; it’s just about everybody being consistent. That’s one of the things that we’re trying to do.\n\nAs a member of the Bucks’ 2024 coaching staff, Rondo offers a behind-the-scenes perspective on the team’s struggles. From mid-November to mid-December, the Bucks lost 13 of 16 games and remain in a Play-In berth, far below expectations.\n\nDespite a promising 4-1 start, the season has unraveled to a disappointing 17-24 record, putting a harsh spotlight on the team’s costly offseason moves. They went all in by waiving and stretching Damian Lillard’s deal, which will additionally take up $22.5 million of the Bucks’ cap space. Milwaukee also agreed to a four-year, $107 million contract with Myles Turner. With three consecutive first-round exits and numerous roster changes, Giannis Antetokounmpo remains frustrated.\n\nRondo pointed out that, given how this slump coincided with Giannis missing games, his name being constantly circled in trade rumors, and then the Bucks fans booing their own players. While the 23-year-old star is performing at his career best, the same can’t be said for the rest of the roster. Veterans such as Myles Turner, Kyle Kuzma, and Gary Trent Jr. have all seen their scoring averages dip from last season.\n\nIt doesn’t help the morale when Antetokounmpo made a social media move, leaving everyone wondering about his motives. Just a few weeks ago, the Bucks superstar deleted every single tweet dating back to July 2021. Then, insiders continued to drop trade updates, as ESPN’s Brian Windhorst confirmed that the Greek Freak had conversations with the front office during the offseason about possibly making a move to New York.\n\nDuring a humiliating 33-point loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves, Bucks fans at Fiserv Forum voiced their frustration loudly and repeatedly. The Bucks were without Myles Turner, but still fell apart against a Timberwolves team missing Anthony Edwards and Rudy Gobert. Giannis finished with 25 points on 9-of-13 shooting, eight rebounds, and five assists, but his performance was not the talking point.\n\nAt the start of the third quarter, the Bucks were already down by 31. Antetokounmpo went in for a powerful layup, finishing through contact and drawing a foul on Julius Randle. After finishing through contact for an and-one, the Greek forward turned to the home crowd and booed right back, along with two ‘thumbs-down’ gestures. But there was something more brewing underneath.\n\n“Maybe my voice is just a broken record, and guys are just tired,” Antetokounmpo said. “Being a leader is the same thing as being a dad. You’ve got to keep being available, being consistent with your words and your actions, over and over again. And one day, you hope the message is going to go through.” Giannis addressed that the Bucks understand what winning looks like, but they’re simply failing to execute the basics before schemes even matter. It signifies a disconnect between effort, accountability, and urgency, leading to frustrations.\n\nThe post Bucks Source Confirms Giannis Antetokounmpo’s Frustrations in Milwaukee Amid Trade Rumors appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

The upcoming AFC Championship game is the biggest game he's ever played as he's stepping in as the Denver Broncos' starting quarterback after Bo Nix suffered a season-ending ankle injury, marking his first-ever playoff start and a huge opportunity in a high-stakes game.\n\nThe 29-year old quarterback hails from a small town roughly 100 miles west of Dallas, Stephenville, TX. He was a standout in his high school days playing for Stephenville High. He emerged as one of the nation's most sought-after quarterback prospects, earning national attention, transferring south of Stephenville to Baylor in Waco, before later transferring to Auburn.\n\nWith Bo Nix out for the season, Denver’s starting QB for next Sunday’s AFC Championship Game will be Jarrett Stidham.

He led the Tigers to an SEC Championship appearance and earned Second-Team All-SEC honors, becoming the SEC Newcomer of the Year. It was his deep-ball accuracy and skillset that earned him an NFL Draft selection in 2019 by the New England Patriots.\n\nAfter three seasons with the Patriots, he was traded to the Raiders in 2022. He later signed a two-year deal with the Broncos in 2023 and then resigned in 2025. Stidham has spent much of his career as a dependable backup, occasionally stepping in when needed but never fully seizing a starting role.

    "description": "The Toffees must hunker down and battle for everything as they await the return of their star players",
    "fullText": "Everton’s FA Cup penalty shootout defeat to Sunderland last weekend ensured that the club’s quest to end its current silverware drought would extend into a 32nd year. Whilst the manner of the exit left a sour taste, that the Blues lost was not, in itself, a surprise. Shorn of options due to injury, AFCON and suspension, David Moyes was limited in the team he could put out — signalled by the presence on the bench of only one player who’s had senior minutes this season, in Thierno Barry.\n\nThings aren’t going to get better in the short term either, with little action on the transfer front being signalled, and returning players not yet back — though Jack Grealish will be available, having completed a one-match ban. Hopefully, that situation will change by the end of the month, but for this afternoon’s road game against Aston Villa, the Toffees arrive in suboptimal condition.\n\nThe Birmingham outfit were faced with a tight position – with regard to the Premier League’s financial regulations – heading towards this season, and attempted to rectify this by moving out some significant earners, such as Philippe Coutinho and Leon Bailey, along with selling academy product Jacob Ramsey to Newcastle United for a sizeable fee (€45.2m). Several players arrived, though major funds were committed only to the purchase of Nice forward Evan Guessand (€30m), with other reinforcements arriving as loans (Jadon Sancho, Harvey Elliot), or free transfers (Viktor Lindelöf).\n\nThat the veteran former Manchester United centre half has been the one to accrue the most game time so far is indicative of a failed transfer window for Villa. Sancho has been in and out of the side, though has started two of the last four league games, but Elliot is in limbo, having played a combined 174 minutes so far across all competitions. His loan move from Liverpool will be made permanent for an agreed fee of €41m should he make ten league appearances, and Villa have apparently decided that they no longer want the man named player of the tournament during the summer’s Euro 2025 Under-21 tournament.\n\nWhen today’s hosts arrived at Hill Dickinson Stadium early in the season, they’d yet to win a game – or even score a goal – but frustrated Everton in a goalless stalemate, with a negative game plan. A couple more draws followed, but from the end of September the Midlanders embarked on a complete turnaround in form, and have won 19 from 23 in all competitions, including a run of eleven straight, which was ended only by league leaders Arsenal. They await the visitors having dispatched Tottenham Hotspur last weekend, in the FA Cup, and on an eleven game winning streak at Villa Park.\n\nVilla will almost certainly line up in a 4-2-3-1 formation.\n\nEmi Martinez faces a late fitness test, so it’s likely that experienced backup Marco Bizot will deputize. The Dutchman is an able replacement, but is nowhere near on the same level as the World Cup winner. Matty Cash will line up at right back, but on the left former Blue Lucas Digne has been alternating with Ian Maatsen. Since the younger man started against Spurs, it’s likely that the 32-year-old Digne will get the nod today. Ezri Konsa is a lock at centre half, and although Lindelöf has started the last six league games in place of the injured Pau Torres, the Spaniard was back for the cup game last weekend, so may retain his spot.\n\nVilla’s midfield will be without both ex-Toffee Amadou Onana and the excellent Boubacar Kamara, due to injury, but Youri Tielemans will look to orchestrate things from a deep position. Lamare Bogarde was handed a rare start against Everton in September, and will do so again. He’s a solid defensive midfielder, but a significant dropoff compared to Kamara, or Onana. Playing higher up will probably be Morgan Rogers, the team’s joint leading scorer, though John McGinn may do so, if Rogers is deployed wide.\n\nWith Villa having offloaded their only other senior forward, Donyell Malen to Roma a couple of days ago, the hosts will field Ollie Watkins up top. The England striker endured a slow start to the campaign, but has four goals from his last four league outings and offers an all-around package which troubles the best defenders. Unai Emery has several wide options, with Emi Buendia probably deployed on the left, and McGinn the most likely on the right, although Sancho has been starting there recently and Rogers can play anywhere behind the striker.\n\nWith the hosts in imperious form for months, and especially so at Villa Park, this presents a stern test for Everton. Grealish’s availability will give the team more quality on the ball, but otherwise this will be the same side which looked short of goal threat, and were outplayed for long stretches a week ago by a Black Cats side also missing several players due to AFCON. Needless to say, Villa are a considerably stronger proposition, and it’s tough to make much of a case for the visitors, unfortunately.\n\nIn terms of the Everton team, Moyes will likely replace Tyler Dibling – who’s been the target of much criticism from elements of the fan base recently – and move Dwight McNeil once again to right wing, in order to accommodate Grealish. Whilst Dibling has struggled in his last couple of outings, what exactly McNeil offers at this stage, and particularly when fielded on the right, is honestly a mystery. Otherwise, the only change will be Barry in for Beto, with the latter anonymous in the Cup game. Again, one man has a future at Everton, and the other does not. Forgotten man Adam Aznou enjoyed an exciting cameo against Sunderland, but it’s hard to imagine Moyes using the youngster here in any capacity, sadly.\n\nAway from home, the Toffees have fared rather better than at Hill Dickinson, having lost just once (against Chelsea) from six, picking up three wins. Admittedly, most of those games featured players like Iliman Ndiaye, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Idrissa Gueye — none of whom will be present at Villa Park this afternoon, but Everton did score a notable success without any of those against Nottingham Forest. Villa however, are not Forest and Emery is certainly not Sean Dyche. Still, the Blues will set up compactly, give a reasonable account of themselves, and although they’ll end up well beaten, I don’t foresee anything embarrassing.\n\nStatistics provided courtesy of transfermarkt.com and fbref.com",

    "description": "The San Francisco 49ers never had a chance against the Seattle Seahawks in the divisional playoffs. Here are the takeaways.",
    "fullText": "It's hard to put a bow on the San Francisco 49ers' 2025 season because of how messy the entire year was.\n\nPerhaps Saturday's blowout loss in Seattle against the Seahawks perfectly encapsulated the year. The 49ers were overwhelmed from the opening kick as the vastly more talented Seattle roster took over the game early and never stopped.\n\nHere's what we took away from a dreary 49ers performance in the divisional playoffs:\n\nSan Francisco looked like a team that didn't run out of gas, but rather showed up to the game on empty. They got off to a horrendous start and put themselves in a 17-0 hole against a Seattle club that was fresh off its bye week. As the game wore on, the 49ers looked substantially worse and the 17-0 lead turned into a rout. They were never going to stop the avalanche once the game got out of hand.\n\nThe game was effectively over in the first two possessions. Seattle returned the opening kickoff for a touchdown to go ahead 7-0. San Francisco got the ball at the 40 to start their first possession and had a little success moving the ball. They got into a second-and-3, and running back Brian Robinson was stopped short with a two-yard run. On third-and-1 the 49ers lost a yard with a handoff to Christian McCaffrey. Then they tried some trickery with an option play that lost three yards on fourth-and-1. Seattle took the short field and made it 10-0. On the 49ers' next drive they were moving again with Jake Tonges catching a throw for 11 yards on second-and-7, but he fumbled. Seattle took over on the 49ers 43 and cruised in for a touchdown to go ahead 17-0. That was it.\n\nThe game script didn't help the 49ers offense and Purdy for most of the second half was under heavy pressure, but he was also not effective. He missed some key throws, turned the ball over twice, and in general didn't do enough to elevate his club. Injuries matter, but the Seahawks are in the 49ers' division and not going away any time soon. Purdy has to be better moving forward because he was not good enough to keep the game from getting out of hand.\n\nIt looked like the 49ers were going to get on the edge of the red zone when Brock Purdy fired a throw in to Pearsall for a first down on third-and-6 in the second quarter. With the score 17-3, a touchdown on the drive would've made things very interesting. Replay assist ruled the catch an incompletion, however, forcing the 49ers to settle for a 56-yard field goal that trimmed the deficit to 17-6. Field goals were never going to get it done with this 49ers defense.\n\nTonges played well, but the 49ers' offense just has a little less juice when Kittle isn't on the field. His blocking was missed in the run game where the 49ers had a rough time getting to the edge. Purdy was also clearly uncomfortable without his favorite target on the field. Kittle not being on the field wasn't why the 49ers lost, but it was very clear how much he matters for their offense.\n\nThe rookie safety started with Ji'Ayir Brown on the sidelines because of a hamstring injury. Sigle's long stint on the sideline as a reserve came back to bite the 49ers in the biggest game of the year. Sigle got lost on the Seahawks first touchdown, and then got thrown in the blender on their second score before missing a tackle on Kenneth Walker. Saturday night doesn't define him, but it was clear San Francisco's young player who didn't get a ton of burn this year wasn't ready to contribute in a meaningful way.\n\nLuter got flambeed twice in the first half. First, he got cooked by Jaxon Smith-Njigba for a touchdown. Then on a vital third-and-10 late in the first half he was beat bad by Jake Bobo who had only two catches during the regular season. The 49ers probably need to invest in their CB depth in the offseason.\n\nGood for the rookie fourth-round pick. He got in the game early in the third quarter because Christian McCaffrey was on the sideline with a shoulder issue. James took his first-career carry for seven yards. He finished the game with 28 yards on six carries.\n\nWhen the 49ers defense did pop Saturday night it was typically Winters making a play. He racked up nine tackles, including three tackles for loss.\n\nMore 49ers: 49ers superstar named winner of the 2026 Bart Starr Award\n\nThis article originally appeared on Niners Wire: 49ers vs. Seahawks: 7 takeaways, standout players from dreary SF loss",

James had 20 points but was just six for 16 from the field. He had nine rebounds and eight assists for a Lakers team that has lost five of its last six games.\n\nDrew Timme was a positive for the Lakers, scoring a career-high 21 points.

Redick said there's a chance Hayes could play Sunday.\n\nJames missed his first five shots in the first quarter, finishing one-for-seven from the field for just two points.\n\nThe Lakers were called for 13 fouls in the first quarter, leading to 22 free-throw attempts for the Trail Blazers, a big reason why they opened a 40-27 lead after the first 12 minutes of play.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "Seattle's level of domination has set the bar incredibly high for whoever wins the frozen showdown between the Chicago Bears and Los Angeles Rams.",
    "fullText": "Seattle laid its claim for the NFL throne in the exact way it did during its dominant run toward the NFC’s No. 1 seed: by ferociously pummeling their opponent without mercy.\n\nThe Seahawks’ offense had a productive, albeit somewhat ugly game Saturday night against the San Francisco 49ers, but Seattle’s defense (and special teams!) stole the show in this 41-6 divisional round wipeout. Now Seattle is a game away from getting back to the Super Bowl for the first time in over a decade.\n\nIt’s a playoff position star defender DeMarcus Lawrence, who had a strip sack of Brock Purdy late in the second half, hasn’t seen in his career after spending 11 seasons with the Dallas Cowboys. His prophetic words from last March about leaving Dallas for Seattle in free agency made a comeback on social media after the Seahawks’ emphatic win. And they’re bound to have some staying power this coming week as the Seahawks prepare for the NFC title game. But what else stuck out for Lawrence that symbolized this tenacious defense was the new necklace he sported postgame with the initials: MOB.\n\nNew “MOB” necklace for DeMarcus Lawrence looks like it wasn’t free pic.twitter.com/sYP7WASZPE\n\n— Mike Sando (@SandoNFL) January 18, 2026\n\n“Yeah, brand new MOB necklace, man,” Lawrence said. “You know, just letting the world know how we coming, you know.”\n\nIn a league where offenses and quarterbacks are the stars of the show, Seattle has built a defense that’s just as compelling as the biggest, flashiest arms in the NFL and they showed that they’re absolutely good enough to ride to a title.\n\nSeattle didn't even let the 49ers get into the game, doing the same thing it did during the Week 18 regular-season finale when it stifled the 49ers’ running game, which subsequently forced Brock Purdy to be a dropback passer and throw into the teeth of an immovable defense. This weekend, the Seahawks held the 49ers to 28 yards on 11 designed runs in the first half, and again forced the 49ers to play a style of football they don’t want to play.\n\nThe Seahawks forced their second turnover on downs of the night to open the third quarter, the offense rewarded the defense with a field goal and the 21-point deficit was too much against Seattle’s marauding defense.\n\nThis is the kind of performance that No. 1 seeds should have against weaker opponents in their conference. Not that the 49ers are a bad team, they’re just an absurdly injured one. But this level of domination has set the bar incredibly high for whoever wins the frozen showdown between the Chicago Bears and Los Angeles Rams. In a season when head coach Kyle Shanahan had all the answers as the 49ers’ lineups shifted and became more depleted, the Seahawks were all over everything he tried to throw out. Not only are they talented, they’re incredibly well-orchestrated with second-year head coach Mike Macdonald pulling all the strings on defense.\n\nThe 49ers didn’t even reach the red zone in this game and this was an offense that ranked top-three in most standard and advanced metrics over the back half of the season. It’s not like the Seahawks have been padding their stats against the worst teams that the league has to offer. This status is earned through trial. The only offense to put up over 20 points on Seattle over the final nine weeks of the season has been the Rams (the Titans scored 24 but they had a 90-yard punt return touchdown). They’ve given up 75 points since Week 13 with 37 of those points, legitimately half, coming against the Rams.\n\nTeams need to be as dialed in, talented and well-coached as the Rams to really score against this defense. The run the Seahawks are on will go down in the record books as an all-time finish if they can maintain this level of defensive dominance against one of two of the better offenses in the NFL. In the Rams’ case, they’re probably just the flat-out best offense period this season.\n\nThat creates a potentially fascinating third matchup between the Seahawks and their division rival Rams, but L.A. still has to get there first. Caleb Williams and the Bears are no pushover at this point, but when Seattle stuffs Shanahan and the 49ers in a locker for the second time in three weeks, it's hard not to feel like this is the current favorite for the Super Bowl. Seattle’s defense is really that good and it has one of the elite special teams units in the entire league, as shown by Rashid Shaheed’s 95-yard opening kickoff return for a touchdown.\n\nThe health of the Bears or Rams will likely create a tougher test than what the 49ers were able to muster, but this defense is playing as well as a unit possibly can in the modern NFL and the Seahawks seem to be getting better each week. No matter who shows up to face the Seahawks next Sunday, the only thing louder than Lumen Field will be the boom this defense brings seemingly every single play.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nComing into Saturday’s playoff matchup, the Denver Broncos led the NFL in penalty yards, yet discipline was not an issue for Denver. Instead, penalties proved costly for Buffalo.\n\nThe Broncos edged the Bills 33–30 in overtime in the divisional round at Mile High, and flags played a decisive role on the final drive.\n\nOn the possession that set up Wil Lutz’s game-winning field goal, Buffalo was twice called for defensive pass interference. The Bills surrendered 47 penalty yards on that drive alone, allowing Denver to move comfortably down the field for the final points of the game.\n\nMORE: Writing Broncos were disciplined after leading the league in penalties entering the game\n\nTaron Johnson was first flagged for defensive pass interference after tightly covering Courtland Sutton on an incompletion, taking him to the ground as the ball arrived. Whether the call was justified or not, Joey Bosa’s penalty would have given Denver yardage regardless, as the Broncos picked up 17 yards on the play.\n\nThe decisive moment for Buffalo came two plays later. Facing 2nd & 12 and already within long field-goal range, Nix threw deep to Marvin Mims, who was covered by Tre’Davious White. This DPI was more apparent, as White began tackling Mims before the ball arrived.\n\nMORE: Broncos' Jarrett Stidham set for football history not done in NFL since Cowboys' Roger Staubach in 1972\n\nEntering the game, referee Carl Cheffers and his crew were known for calling a higher-than-average number of penalties. Additionally, Denver had been the most penalized team in the league—particularly for defensive pass interference—while Josh Allen had drawn the most penalties that resulted in points. Despite those trends, the Broncos’ secondary remained disciplined, as Denver was flagged just three times for 20 yards in the entire game.\n\nJa'Quan McMillian OT interception: How Broncos cornerback stole ball from Brandin Cooks and saved Denver's season\n\nJa'Quan McMillian OT interception: How Broncos cornerback stole ball from Brandin Cooks and saved Denver's season\n\nExploring 5 wild Broncos QB options including Tom Brady, Cam Newton, Russell Wilson and more after Bo Nix injury\n\nCould Broncos sign Colin Kaepernick?

    "fullText": "Manchester United completely dominated the 198th Manchester derby, eventually emerging 2-0 winners at Old Trafford on Saturday.\n\nIt was Manchester City’s biggest xG loss since Pep Guardiola took charge, and the scoreline could have easily read 5-0 if not for marginal offside calls and the post coming in between twice.\n\nMichael Carrick got his gameplan spot on, with the caretaker head coach playing players in their natural positions.\n\nFor far too long under Ruben Amorim, the team tried to play in a way that deviated from the club’s history.\n\nAt times on Saturday, it was eerily reminiscent of how the Red Devils used to play under Sir Alex Ferguson, keeping things compact at the back before springing on the counter.\n\nEverytime City attacked, they looked even more vulnerable when the possession was turned over. The first goal was the perfect evidence.\n\nUnited legend Peter Schmeichel attested to the fact, claiming to Premier League Productions that Carrick had restored the United DNA in a very short amount of time.\n\n“There was there was no restraint. Go forward. And we saw that in the first goal you had, you know, it’s a defending, it’s a free kick that Harry heads it out, and all of a sudden they’re four against two.\n\n“That’s not something I’ve seen for a very, very long time with Manchester United. But that is what Manchester United is historically always has been able to do.\n\n“You know, as soon as the ball is won, you go forward and you don’t think about what’s going to happen behind you.\n\n“That I think is something they’ve been talking to them about a lot that when you get that opportunity and it was fantastic.”\n\nIt made for stunning viewing for fans, who will be hoping for more of the same next week when the 20-time English league champions take on Arsenal at the Emirates.\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

On Saturday at Chase Center, the Warriors buried 23 3-pointers to surge past the Hornets for a 136-116 win. Seven different members of the Warriors drilled two or more 3-pointers.\n\nDe'Anthony Melton led the Warriors again, scoring a team-high 24 points off the bench on 8-of-16 shooting from the field and 3-of-6 from beyond the arc with six rebounds and three assists in 21 minutes. Melton has now scored 22 or more points in three of his last six games. The Warriors are 5-1 over that span. In games Melton has been in the lineup this season, the Warriors have posted an 11-6 record.\n\nMoses Moody knocked down four 3-pointers on his way to 12 points in 27 minutes. Draymond Green added 20 points on 8-of-14 shooting with four made 3-pointers. Brandin Podziemski stayed hot, scoring 16 points on 5-of-9 shooting with a trio of made 3-pointers in 30 minutes off the bench.\n\nSteph Curry, Buddy Hield and Al Horford each knocked down a pair of triples on Saturday against the Hornets.\n\nThe Warriors made franchise history on Saturday night at Chase Center. For the first time in franchise history, the Warriors have made at least 20 3-pointers in three straight games.\n\nAlong with winning three straight games, the Warriors have won five of six games on their current eight-game home stand.

    "title": "Obituary: Former Sunderland Defender Alan Black",
    "description": "Roker Report pays tribute to former player Alan Black, who passed away earlier this week.",
    "fullText": "Everybody at Roker Report was saddened to learn of the death of former Sunderland player Alan Black, who passed away recently at the age of 82. The following is an updated version of an article that was originally published in 2024 to celebrate his 81st birthday…\n\nHaving joined from Dumbarton Alan Black provided cover mainly for club stalwart Len Ashurst, which in turn enabled John Parke to take over from the injured Cec Irwin, yet the sixties signing didn’t disgrace himself in Sunderland colours and would go on to enjoy a more prominent role at his next destination.\n\nBorn in June 1943, Black grew up in Alexandria – the same western Scotland town as Bobby Kerr. Having begun at Drumchapel Amateurs, as a youngster he turned down the opportunity to play for Blackpool and opted to remain at semi-professional Dumbarton instead so that he could continue his engineering apprenticeship. Once his studies were done though he accepted the offer of a month-long trial at Roker and before it was even complete had agreed to leave the Sons and join the Lads on a permanent basis.\n\nMoving in September 1964 when the board were overseeing the majority of first team affairs prior to the appointment of George Hardwick, Black made his debut the following February with something of a baptism of fire, but despite facing a Manchester United side that included the great ‘Trinity’ of Bobby Charlton, Denis Law and George Best, he helped secure a clean sheet and narrow victory against the Red Devils – fellow Scot Harry Hood getting the only goal in front of a 51,000 strong crowd.\n\nThree days later Sunderland were in the capital to play Fulham and despite defeat he gave a solid showing. This was to be Black’s last game of 1964-65 however, and it wasn’t until October that he resurfaced, deputising for Ashurst once again in another away match at West Bromwich Albion.\n\nNow working under his countryman Ian McColl, he followed that up with another appearance seven days later, when he came on for the injured Jimmy Montgomery in the last few minutes of a thrilling win over Nottingham Forest. Martin Harvey went in goal in place of Monty, with Black slotting into the defence after becoming only the second ever substitute in a competitive Sunderland fixture – he may have also been involved in midweek too had the League Cup permitted substitutes, as fellow Parke was forced to limp on in a tie against Aston Villa despite taking a heavy whack.\n\nThere were to be two more outings for Black during the campaign, both coming away from home in a draw at Sheffield United and then a during a defeat to Liverpool. Having played the full 90 at Bramall Lane he then came on from the bench again on Merseyside the following weekend, and whilst the Lads were already trailing when introduced this proved to be his final game for the club.\n\nBlack left Sunderland a little over a week before the 2nd anniversary of him signing full time. One of several reserves that McColl was willing to part with as he looked to raise funds for incoming deals, the £9,000 Norwich City forked out soon looked like good business – their new arrival debuting later that evening in a 2-1 win at Northampton Town. His Canaries bow proved to be a good precursor to the rest of his time at Carrow Road too, where he became a crowd favourite and featured in the Division Two championship winning season of 1971-72.\n\nAfter playing over 200 times for the team, including five instances of him lining up against Sunderland, Black returned to Dumbarton in 1973 but was soon forced to retire due to knee problems. The Norwich title win, which had included a return to Wearside during the run in for a 1-1 draw, meant the club had reached the topflight for the first time – a feat that contributed towards Black subsequently being inducted into their Hall of Fame and gladly accepting many subsequent invites back to Norfolk.\n\nIt was in his native Dumbartonshire region though where he lived, remaining there once his football career was over and making use of his familiarity with the area by becoming a taxi driver. Rest in peace Alan, and best wishes to his loved ones from all at Roker Report.\n\n*The photograph at the start of this piece shows Alan celebrating the Durham Challenge Cup that he won whilst playing for Sunderland reserves during 1965-66. The team beat West Auckland 3-2 in the final at Darlington and alongside him are Keenan (l) and Campbell (r).",

    "fullText": "I thought Hume played very well.\n\nWhenever people discuss a predicted team, it’s Hume that gets the push. He’s not always guaranteed his right back berth but it’s not a problem as he can slot in at left back or more recently, in midfield. He was also the creator of a few deft moves and had one or two chances himself.\n\nYou can’t keep Northern Ireland’s man of the moment down. Mentions as always for Nordi Mukiele, Granit Xhaka and Enzo Le Fée, but I was impressed with Hume.\n\nAnother victory from a losing position — epitomised by Brian Brobbey, who got his usual battering but kept on going and got a very deserved goal.\n\nThis team doesn’t give up. Big hearts, big engines and big desire.\n\nWe were very open at the back, especially in the early stages of the first half.\n\nCrystal Palace had several breaks that on another day could have seen us 0-2 down before we got going. Luckily, as usual, Régis Le Bris and the team sorted it out and we became more solid and more assured.\n\nThe first few home games this season had most people staying until the final whistle, but the early leavers are back.\n\nThey stop in the gangways and block people’s view, then everyone has to stand. It’s a free country, but does anyone leave the theatre or cinema early?\n\nAn amazing winner from Brobbey underlined his value to our team.\n\nHe battled throughout, showing his strength and skill. It’s really important to have the outlet that the big Dutchman provides — and the finish off the underside of the bar was truly remarkable.\n\nThis was another game during which nobody could be faulted for their performance, and the team we support is so much more than a group of talented individuals.\n\nWe have players that genuinely care about the city, the fans, and where we finish in this league.\n\nI love that about these players — they sweat blood for each other and that’s very reassuring.\n\nIs there a pattern developing that to start dominating home games, we need to go behind? Six of the eleven home games have followed this script.\n\nOur head coach has a Ph.D. in sports performance so he may have some insights he can share. As a fan, I find it quite relaxing to follow home games, with two rules: A. Don’t worry if we concede first, and B. We’re not going to lose anyway.\n\nThis is an amazing way to enjoy and take in matches.\n\nI can’t come up with anything negative. This was a much-needed and deserved victory; we’re getting our best players back and it all bodes well for the rest of the season.\n\nHappy times to be a Sunderland fan.\n\nHistorically, going 0-1 down at home would be the beginning of the end.\n\nHowever, this team is different and the resilience demonstrated to not just get back into the game but to then go on and win it was admirable. What certainly helps, though, is the crowd, as nobody was getting on the players’ backs when we conceded.\n\nInstead, there was an encouraging roar and it helped solidify our unbeaten home form.\n\nConsidering that we signed Brobbey on deadline day, it’s incredible to think that he’s turning into one of our most important signings of the transfer window.\n\nHis strength and ability to pin in three centre backs is undoubtedly a huge reason why we got three points this afternoon — and that’s without even talking about the finish, which was absolutely sublime.\n\nA class footballer and I can’t wait to see how he continues to develop.\n\nI can’t help but feel that at times, that we’re in a time machine and have been transported back to League One when it comes to referees. The “main event” energy that’s surrounded the last few officials has been suitably minging to watch.\n\nIf there’s one thing that’s bound to get on the collective tits of everyone at the Stadium of Light, it’s inconsistency.\n\nThis referee personified that and some of the decisions that Jean-Philippe Mateta was able to get compared to Brobbey was just ridiculous.\n\nWhen we’re 2-1 up in a close game, I find it baffling that anybody would leave.\n\nWe ask the team to give 100% until the final whistle and given that we just have to sit there, it’s not difficult to ask for everyone to stay until the game ends, not least of all to give the team the credit and appreciation they deserve after such a fantastic performance.\n\nOur big number nine was my man of the match. His hold-up play got us up the park and his battle with the Palace defenders rarely went their way.\n\nHow he managed to score a goal by putting the ball over the keeper and under the bar is beyond me.\n\nAnother great performance, with a goal and a hell of a shift put in.\n\nThe man covers every blade of grass on the pitch and is as strong in defence as he is in attack\n\nAfter his panenka nightmare, he’s recovered and kicked on massively — and the love for Le Fée is clear from the songs we all sing.\n\nThe chances for Brobbey and Trai Hume earlier in the game should’ve been converted — both great moments for us but not taken advantage of.\n\nWe didn’t suffer from that lack of clinical finishing, but on another day, we may have done.\n\nThe gaffer left it until about ten minutes before the end before putting any fresh legs on.\n\nGiven the way we harried and pressed Palace, we may have closed the game out sooner with fresh limbs, but what do I know that the French professor doesn’t?\n\nI’m clutching for a second “down”, because to be honest, there aren’t many options.\n\nThe Stadium of Light is still a fortress. We’re the comeback kings — and we’re in the top eight and above the scum.\n\nNot sure it gets a lot better than that.\n\nBrobbey was fouled all game and got no protection from the referee, but ultimately had the last laugh by scoring a winner which had people scratching their heads asking “How did he do that?”.\n\nHe was a handful from start to finish; a proper, old-fashioned centre-forward, bullying the Palace defence. His footwork was a little awry in the first half, as he had a few chances where the ball got under his feet.\n\nHowever, his persistence paid off with a fabulous winner in the 71st minute, as he dinked the ball into the net from five yards out.\n\nHow did we pick him up for such a ridiculous fee?\n\n£9.5 million plus add-ons seems like absolute daylight robbery for a player who provided the assist for Enzo Le Fée’s opening goal and should’ve been awarded a penalty when Romaine Mundle was bundled over in the penalty area when he received another cross from Mukiele.\n\nMukiele and Brobbey were given yellow cards for telling the ref to stop the constant and persistent fouling by Palace’s defence.\n\nBrobbey was constantly being fouled and manhandled — so much so that I got a little concerned that he might be provoked into kicking out. Thankfully, he kept his head and had the last laugh, but the referee had to give our players better protection. He also missed a stonewall penalty as Romaine Mundle was bundled down in the box after receiving a cross from Nordi Mukiele.\n\nGranit Xhaka turned in an uncharacteristically hesitant display in the middle of the park and almost gifted Palace an opener.\n\nWe looked indecisive and tentative at times, but things improved in the second half as Régis Le Bris had looked quite annoyed as he headed down the tunnel for the half time break.",

    "description": "This is ‘New Sunderland’. We are a side whose heads are incapable of dropping, and as a result, seem to almost be galvanised by conceding.",
    "fullText": "After two weeks of back-page murmurs and speculation, Sunderland finally ‘joined the chat’ in the January transfer market, announcing the acquisition of Jocelin Ta Bi — a reportedly crafty winger from Israeli side Maccabi Netanya.\n\nFashionably going by his first name on the back of his shirt, à la trendsetters ‘Virgil’ van Dijk, as well as most of the Brazilian national side, the forward has averted any prospective mix-up with our other right-winger Chemsdine Talbi, much to the relief of commentary teams across the land.\n\nThis Christian-name-on-back-of-shirt fad had me thinking: imagine our entire squad followed suit, all in the name of self-promotion and personal brand.\n\nWe’d have a trio of Brian, Simon, and Wilson leading the line – names of middle-aged fellas you’d find perusing the Daily Mail down at any Wetherspoons, lapping up the latest Reform UK drivel. Not forgetting their mate, Dennis, who, unlike the rest of them, still has all his hair and teeth.\n\nYet, perhaps the best of the lot would be the outgoing Blondy. Presumably, a player named after either Debbie Harry or his definitely-not-dyed peroxide hair.\n\nAnyway, enough on player first names and more on Saturday’s game with Crystal Palace: a side who ended last season with an FA Cup triumph, and started this campaign with a Community Shield win and European qualification.\n\nOn paper a very solid outfit, but contextually anything but. They are a club seemingly in free-fall, with stalwart Marc Guéhi poised to join Manchester City, while boss Oliver Glasner tendered his resignation in midweek.\n\nThat said, while Régis Le Bris has worked wonders in distancing us from that Sunderland-y reputation that once preceded us, Yeremy Pino’s opener following our pretty solid start was very on-brand for the Sunderland of old.\n\nThere were several dips in concentration, with Robin Roefs being called into action on a few occasions, including to deny Jean-Philippe Mateta early on. A rare defensive lapse saw Palace’s only real creative outlet on the day, deftly place it beyond Roefs. It was a pretty sloppy goal to concede, made more frustrating by the fact that it was straight from a set-piece.\n\nNevertheless, this is ‘New Sunderland’. We are a side whose heads are incapable of dropping, and as a result, seem to almost be galvanised by conceding.\n\nIt took just three minutes for Enzo Le Fée to restore parity. Following an intricate bit of interplay down our left side, the Frenchman guided Nordi Mukiele’s low-driven cross into the bottom corner with effortless finesse.\n\nAfter the break, there was only one team out to win it. Our second-half display really exhibited us at our very best; defensively solid, tenacious in midfield, and potent in the transition.\n\nIn the 71st minute, Noah Sadiki’s line-splitting through-ball put Brian Brobbey in on goal, and with a sublime stroke of his right boot, our £20 million Dutchman half-scooped-half-thumped it over Dean Henderson, who was left helpless as the ball satisfyingly sailed in off the bar. 2-1.\n\nWhile our visitors probed in the dying embers, we remained dogged at the back, and could so very easily have made it three via a sumptuous back-to-front move which ultimately saw Trai Hume clip the top of the crossbar.\n\nWith three points under our belt, breaking the string of five games without a win, and protecting our unbeaten home record, this was another superb afternoon on Wearside.\n\nRumour has it that Brobbey would not have had to be surgically removed from his back if he had not been substituted, as Maxence Lacroix would have had to be removed due to the defender’s persistent, unpunished fouling of our number nine.\n\nBrobbey cramping up after his goal was actually due to the fact he had been supporting the body mass of two men all game.\n\nAlthough Granit Xhaka had a poor afternoon by his impeccably high standards, I was, once again, left speechless by the collective effort of the team. From Mukiele’s marauding runs down the centre of the pitch, Noah Sadiki’s unrelenting press, and Le Fée’s class to Omar Alderete’s trivela cross, I thought there were standout moments for all involved.\n\nA victory that propels us up to eighth, three points off fourth and back above those lot up the road (even if it’s only temporarily) — the boys in red and white have delivered once more.",

    "description": "As I headed home, I was left with one overriding impression – Sunderland AFC and the city the club calls home are marching together in lockstep towards a long-overdue renaissance in their fortunes.",
    "fullText": "We normally drive up from Yorkshire for home games but, for a variety of reasons, I attended the game against Crystal Palace on my own. A quick check of rail fares meant that the Grand Central return ticket was less than £20 (courtesy of being an old git with a Senior railcard) so, accompanied by a Sainsbury’s meal deal and a couple of cans of JD and Coke, I took the relaxing option to head north.\n\nArriving in Sunderland, I followed the crowds heading for the Keel Crossing. It has been several years since I made the journey from the city centre to the SoL on foot and, for someone who grew up in Seaburn and Roker in the 60s, when the sides of the Wear were dominated by the shipyards of Austin & Pickersgill, Doxfords and others, it was something of a revelation!\n\nAs I headed towards the recently opened bridge, the evidence of redevelopment was all around me. New buildings and sites surrounded by Heras fencing, awaiting construction, were everywhere.\n\nThe new bridge afforded a wonderful view of the iconic Wearmouth Bridge, through the crowds of supporters making their way to the game, whilst the Stadium of Light itself appeared even more imposing in the distance, from an angle I have never approached it from before. At the other end of the bridge, much of the derelict buildings that had blighted the area for so long have either been refurbished or replaced – the tasteful redevelopment of the historic Sheepfolds Stables is particularly impressive. Of course, the area has been neglected for decades, and there is still much work to be done.\n\nThe return journey in the dark, with the opposite bank of the bridge all lit up, around City Hall, was the perfect illustration of how bright the future of the city is looking.\n\nIn between, there was the small matter of a fixture against Crystal Palace, who should have been in disarray after the loss of captain Marc Guéhi and the announcement that Oliver Glasner would leave at the end of the season. It proved to be far from the case, with the physically imposing Jean-Philippe Mateta proving a real handful for Dan Ballard. The French striker hit the back of the net with a beautiful piece of control leading to a lethal strike, only to see his effort ruled offside.\n\nAt the opposite end of the pitch, Brian Brobbey must have thought he had mistakenly wandered into an MMA cage, as he was repeatedly pushed, pulled, and held without evoking any interest from referee Rob Jones.\n\nA failure to clear the lines after a corner – which came after Jones awarded a contentious free-kick to the away side – led to Palace opening the scoring, and it looked like the Lads were in for a difficult afternoon. But, with Enzo Le Fée pushing up closer to Brobbey, a well-worked cross from Nordi Mukiele found the mercurial little Frenchman. The defenders were already drawn towards Brobbey, leaving Enzo to stroke the ball home emphatically to level the scores, before half-time.\n\nSunderland started the second half much more aggressively. As the rough treatment of Brobbey continued, referee Jones’ already limited control of the game threatened to disappear altogether, in a flurry of yellow cards. But the burly Dutch striker would have the last laugh. Noah Sadiki burst forward, driving at the Palace defence before chipping the ball towards Brobbey. Just as he had done against Arsenal, he deftly flicked the ball over the advancing goalkeeper and into the net, before collapsing with cramp into the advertising hoardings, in front of a delirious home end.\n\nSunderland continued to press and Trai Hume was denied by Henderson and the bar, much to my disappointment as I had a bet on the Irishman to score!\n\nMayenda replaced the tiring Brobbey and as Palace pushed forward unsuccessfully in search of an equaliser, both he and Dan Ballard were denied from close range by Dean Henderson. Dennis Cirkin replaced Romaine Mundle in the dying minutes – the young winger having shown that he is adapting to the demands of Premier League football, linking up effectively with Sadiki and Reinildo on the left, and contributing defensively. Chemsdine Talbi is due back after the AFCON final but he has had little game time in the past few weeks, so having other options is essential for Le Bris.\n\nThere was a particularly significant moment as the players left the field. Normally the celebrating fans sing in praise of Granit Xhaka – instead the strains of ‘We’ve got Le Fée’ rang out in unison, his misfortune in the Brentford game banished to the annals of history. Afterwards, he spoke about how important the support of the crowd meant to him, a salutary reminder of how much we react as fans can impact our players.\n\nAnother comeback win, up to eighth place in the League, unbeaten at home, another three points on the board and just seven more needed in 16 games to reach the magic 40-point mark – all in all, a very satisfactory afternoon’s work by the Lads. For a returning son of the city, it was equally pleasing to see the upturn in the area which surrounds the Stadium of Light.\n\nAs I headed home, I was left with one overriding impression – Sunderland AFC and the city the club calls home are marching together in lockstep towards a long-overdue renaissance in their fortunes.",

    "description": "One confirmed exit and several unresolved situations have left Barça navigating a familiar balancing act.",
    "fullText": "FC Barcelona are used to conversations about patience when it comes to young midfielders. This winter, that patience is being tested from several angles at once.\n\nThe most jarring case is that of Dro Fernández. The 18-year-old has opted to trigger his €6m release clause this January, a move that caught those inside the Ciutat Esportiva off guard. His departure is particularly stinging because his trajectory under Hansi Flick was pointing upward. Flick took him on the preseason tour, handed him a senior debut, and trusted him with starts against high-level opposition like Atlético Madrid.\n\nFlick was reportedly “furious” to learn of the decision. Recently, he said it was one of the biggest disappointments in his life, as Deco had been working behind the scenes to secure a renewal. But the outside interest proved too much, and the decision is already made. Dro has agreed a move to Paris Saint-Germain, bringing a swift conclusion to months of speculation.\n\nDro’s exit may not be the last for Barcelona’s midfielders. For Marc Casadó, the situation remains complicated. Despite being one of Flick’s early success stories, even earning a Spain call-up, the return of Frenkie de Jong has pushed Casadó to the side. The youngster’s role has shrunk. This season he has logged 871 minutes across 19 appearances, starting 10 times and being substituted at half time on two occasions.\n\nLast summer, Barcelona were prepared to entertain a €30m offer from West Ham, only for Flick to intervene. Now, the player’s own stance has shifted.\n\nAccording to Marca, Casadó is increasingly open to a move to protect his spot in Luis de la Fuente’s Spain squad ahead of the World Cup. Atlético Madrid are watching closely. Flush with cash from the €40m sale of Conor Gallagher to Tottenham, Diego Simeone is looking for midfield reinforcements, and Casadó fits the profile.\n\nMarc Bernal presents a more nuanced case. After losing a year to a cruciate ligament injury just as the Flick era began, his return in September has been handled with caution. With only 273 minutes across 12 appearances, Bernal was considered a potential candidate for a January loan. Girona emerged as a primary suitor.\n\nHowever, a recent Copa del Rey start against Racing Santander may have changed things. Bernal played an hour, and despite the physical toll, the experience was enough to convince him he can still contribute at Barça. Mundo Deportivo reports that Bernal is now leaning toward staying.\n\nDe Jong and Pedri remain locked as the starters in the midfield two, plus there’s Gavi’s return in the long run. And with Fermín López and Dani Olmo vying for the spot behind the striker, a place also sometimes occupied by Raphinha, it’s not easy to get minutes there, either.\n\nHaving already lost one young midfielder to the transfer market, Barcelona will be eager not to lose any more.",

    "description": "Phil West looks at the main stories from the Lads’ victory over the Eagles — an impressive and key win!",
    "fullText": "After a Christmas and New Year run that hardly represented a “slump” but was marked by one or two less-than-convincing displays and culminated in a disappointing defeat at the hands of Brentford, this felt like an ideal opportunity for the Lads to rediscover the winning habit, given that our immediate run of fixtures feels extremely favourable and could essentially see Sunderland edge over the safety line with ample room to spare.\n\nDoubtless reinvigorated by last weekend’s FA Cup success and with Noah Sadiki and Reinildo returning to the Stadium of Light following their AFCON odyssey, Régis Le Bris’ men recovered from the concession of a strange-looking goal from Yéremy Pino to overturn the deficit with strikes from Enzo Le Fée and Brian Brobbey, and adding to an ever-growing list of Crystal Palace problems in the process, with manager Oliver Glasner already on the way out and captain Marc Guéhi seemingly bound for Manchester City.\n\nAhead of the game, I felt the visitors from south London weren’t to be underestimated — this division has a habit of punishing such mindsets — but despite falling behind, it was hard not to be impressed with the resilience and focus demonstrated by Sunderland, and after an energetic, potent and generally dominant second half display, we ran out as deserved winners against a side for whom choppy waters may lie ahead.\n\nIf the signing of the powerful Dutchman from Ajax represented something of a gamble during the summer transfer window, he’s starting to repay the transfer fee and then some, because this was as dynamic, impactful and downright brutal a display as I’ve seen from a Sunderland striker in years.\n\nIt wasn’t just the goal (itself a very well-taken second half strike that gave us a lead we would never relinquish) — it was the way he set about the visiting defence, rarely letting them settle, holding the ball up and bringing his teammates into play — as well as taking more than his fair share of the lumps along the way.\n\nTo my eyes at least, Brobbey seems to relish such battles and when he left the pitch to a standing ovation late in the second half, it felt as much in response to his all-round display and the sheer workload he’d blasted through as it did for what proved to be the winning goal.\n\nHe’s looking ever more like a perfect fit for this side and he’s becoming a very popular figure with the red and white faithful. Keep going, Brian!\n\n“You want a response? I’ll give you a response!”\n\nOK, perhaps I’m being presumptuous and putting words into the mouth of the French magician but after recent events and all that talk about how he “owed us” (he didn’t, by the way), why should we not celebrate the fact that this sublimely gifted footballer both plays for and has clearly taken to life at Sunderland AFC as much as any other player in the squad?\n\nHe slotted home the equaliser following a sharp Sunderland break and as is generally the case every time he takes to the field, he was more or less everywhere, carrying his share of the load in both attack and defence — importantly so, because Granit Xhaka and Noah Sadiki weren’t at their best yesterday — which went a long way towards the eventual victory.\n\nIf I was a young Sunderland fan, I’d be starry-eyed when watching Le Fée. As it is, I’m thirty six, I’m increasingly grumpy and I don’t move very quickly — and I’m still starry-eyed when I watch Le Fée. He’s just so good.\n\nHe got a warm reception when he came out to warm up and as Régis Le Bris has previously disclosed, Neil remains a professional presence within the home dressing room at the Stadium of Light, but it’s also hard to escape the reality that this chapter appears to be drawing to a close and that the former skipper will soon be moving on to pastures new.\n\nSunderland AFC is now a very different club to the organization that Neil played such a key role in restoring to its place among the elite of English football, but if this was the latest waypoint on his long goodbye to Wearside, there was no hint of bad feelings or bitterness, and in an era when players often don’t think twice about throwing tantrums if things don’t work out behind the scenes, that says something about Neil’s approach to football and his respect for our club.",

    "description": "Mick Buxton’s Sunderland needed a replay plus extra time to overcome their FA Cup foes.",
    "fullText": "Having played, rather infamously, in 1974 and then as recently as 2014, Sunderland and Carlisle United are no strangers to FA Cup meet ups. The clubs were even drawn against each other for two years running in 1994 and 1995, with both ties having to be settled via replays at Brunton Park – the first instance of which took place on this day.\n\nA hard-fought draw earlier in the month On This Day (8 January 1994): Buxton’s Boys look to avenge Stokoe’s Stars | Roker Report meant the sides had to do it all again in Cumbria, where heavy rain and a rapid frost thaw had left the pitch in a less than ideal condition. Nevertheless, referee Roger Dilkes was happy for the match to start having carried out an inspection earlier in the day, although the arrival of strong winds come kick-off did make the already difficult conditions even more tricky to cope with.\n\nThe weather proved to be a factor in not only the game itself, but Mick Buxton’s team selection also; young forward Craig Russell had picked up a knock at the weekend during Sunderland’s game against Middlesbrough, and having taken the playing surface into consideration the manager felt that Lee Howey’s more physical approach would be better suited. Howey was on a high anyway having scored the header that had settled the Wear Tees clash, and with Don Goodman and Gordon Armstrong already sidelined through injury the last thing the squad needed was to lose Russell for a period by forcing him into a prolonged slog on a mud bath.\n\nRussell was instead brought on to see out Sunderland’s passage into the next round having just seen them take the lead, although it had been a long time coming admittedly. Despite Carlisle’s Division Three status they dominated the first half, and having already given the Lads a scare on Wearside they looked a decent bet going into the break. Simon Davey and David Reeves both looked dangerous, whilst Rod Thomas was also a threat, but they were unable to find a breakthrough and as time marched on the visitors came on strong.\n\nSince Buxton had replaced Terry Butcher in November Sunderland had only lost twice, and their new found resilience meant the Blues eventually ran out of steam before being forced to sit back. A quality move involving Gary Owers, Richard Ord and Phil Gray led to a period of pressure after an hour and ten minutes later Gray came within a fraction of scoring having been put through by Brian Atkinson. Still, it needed extra time before the crucial goal, with Howey sweeping an Ord knockdown from a Martin Smith corner into the net to send the away support behind the goal wild.\n\nThe 4,000 or so travelling fans made up around a third of the total attendance, and a number of them ended up on the pitch amidst the celebrations. His decision to pick Howey vindicated, Buxton brought Russell on shortly after the action had recommenced – meaning that the ‘Jarra Arra’ could now run at a tired defence in the closing stages and look to keep possession well away from his own goal. The tactic worked a treat and whilst it might have been a grind at times it was enough to give Sunderland their first FA Cup victory over Carlisle, who 20 years earlier had been the ones to bring their defence of the trophy to an abrupt end.\n\nSunderland: Chamberlain; Owers, Bennett, Melville, Ord; Atkinson (Russell 106’), Ferguson, Ball, Smith; Howey, P. Gray Unused: Norman, Ma. Gray\n\nBrunton Park, attendance 12 771",

    "fullText": "Juventus have reportedly joined their rivals Roma in the race for Manchester United striker Joshua Zirkzee, who could genuinely leave the club this month.\n\nThe Dutchman has been struggling for minutes since the start of the season. Following the arrivals of summer signings Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, and Benjamin Sesko, he found himself at the bottom of Ruben Amorim’s attacking pecking order, only earning a starting role when some of his teammates were missing due to injuries.\n\nThe former Bologna star was hoping to make a good first impression on the new Man Utd boss, Michael Carrick, but he wasn’t even in the matchday squad for the Derby victory over Man City.\n\nESPN journalist Rob Dawson revealed that the striker’s absence is due to a knock he received in training earlier this week.\n\nIn addition to providing updates on the player’s condition, Dawson also revealed that the Netherlands international could still end up leaving Man Utd before the end of January. This was also echoed by Dutch journalist Joost Blaauwhof.\n\n“Joshua Zirkzee is missing from the Manchester derby due to injury,” he posted on his X account.\n\n“The striker is sidelined for a short period and could already have played his last match at Old Trafford if action in Italy picks up soon. The possibility of that is considerable. The Manchester United striker is reportedly keen on joining AS Roma.”\n\n(Photo by Michael Regan/Getty Images)\n\nZirkzee’s possible move to Roma has been well-documented over the past few months, as the Italian capital side has been keen to add him to Gian Piero Gasperini’s ranks.\n\nBut according to Sky Sport Italia journalist Gianluca Di Marzio, the Giallorossi could have company in the race, as Juventus are also considering a move.\n\nThe transfer market insider insists that the Turin-based giants are determined to sign Crystal Palace bomber Jean-Philippe Mateta, who has also been on Man Utd’s shortlist, but they have identified Zirkzee as a fallback option.\n\nIt should be noted that Carrick decided to drop Sesko from the starting lineup on his debut, which could spell further bad news for the already-frustrated Zirkzee.\n\nThe English head coach is seemingly in favour of fielding Mbeumo in the No.9 role to make room for Amad Diallo on the right wing. The Cameroonian responded well to the change, scoring the all-important opener against Man City.\n\nIf this trend continues, Zirkzee might find himself third in line for the striker role in a season where United hardly need extra depth due to the lack of commitments. Therefore, the Dutchman might soon be marked as surplus to requirements, opening the door for a return to Italy.",

    "description": "The Lakers were very short-handed on Saturday versus the Trail Blazers, and they ended up losing again by a wide margin.",
    "fullText": "The day before the Los Angeles Lakers' Saturday matchup against the Portland Trail Blazers, Luka Doncic was ruled out due to groin soreness. Prior to the opening tip of that game, they got more bad news when it was revealed that starting center Deandre Ayton and backup center Jaxson Hayes also wouldn't play.\n\nWith Austin Reaves still sidelined due to a gastrocnemius strain, the Lakers were in a very difficult situation against a Portland team that had won eight of its last 11 games.\n\nLos Angeles was competitive early, but a 15-2 Trail Blazers run put them up 40-27 at the end of the first quarter. They shot a whopping 22 free throws in the first quarter, and in general, that first period set the tone for the entire evening.\n\nThe Lakers were never able to mount a serious challenge, as they ended up losing, 132-116. It was their fifth loss in their last six games and their 12th loss in their last 21 contests, as well as the second game in a row they gave up over 130 points.\n\nThey simply got outclassed in almost every category. They let Portland shoot 52.3% from the field and 38.1% from 3-point range, and they got outrebounded by 15 while giving up 27 second-chance points. It's becoming a broken record for the Lakers — they continue to put up a weak level of resistance defensively while often getting outplayed in the effort categories.\n\nThey now have a 24-16 record and remain in sixth place in the Western Conference, and they're just half a game ahead of the seventh-place Phoenix Suns.\n\nSmart did plenty to give the Lakers a chance to win this game, at least offensively. He took 17 shot attempts, which was a new season high for him, and made nine of them while going 4-of-6 from 3-point range, giving him a team-high 25 points. He also had two rebounds and one steal, but he had no assists in 25 minutes.\n\nThe Lakers needed an all-hands-on-deck effort, especially offensively, in this game, but LaRavia didn't pull his weight. He got off only two shot attempts and missed both of them, and he scored just two points on free throws. In 28 minutes, he contributed five rebounds, four assists and one steal.\n\nKleber has barely scored or even looked to score this season, but early on, he was aggressive offensively. He scored nine points in the first quarter and ended up with 11 points on 4-of-8 field-goal shooting, and he also had five rebounds, one assist and one steal in 21 minutes.\n\nVincent wasn't able to give L.A. much, if anything, on offense. He missed all but one of his six shot attempts and ended up with three points and one assist in 23 minutes.\n\nJames was 1-of-7 in the first quarter and 3-of-12 in the first half, and while he shot somewhat better afterward, he never truly got it going. He finished with 20 points on 6-of-16 shooting from the field, although he did make all seven of his free throw attempts. James did help out with nine rebounds, eight assists, two blocks and one steal.\n\nHachimura made a nice offensive contribution off the bench in 19 minutes. He made four of his seven shot attempts to score 11 points, to go along with one rebound, one assist and two steals.\n\nIn 18 minutes, Vanderbilt made all three of his shots to score six points and added two rebounds, one assist and one block.\n\nTimme, a 6-foot-10 power forward who is on a two-way contract, had a fantastic outing and made the most of his 29 minutes of playing time. He shot 9-of-12 overall and 3-of-4 from downtown, giving him 21 points, and he mixed it up well by scoring deep in the paint and also hitting from the perimeter. He also had four assists, two rebounds and two steals.\n\nAt times, Bufkin hustled well on defense, resulting in two blocks, and on the other end of the floor, he made three of his eight shot attempts, giving him nine points in 22 minutes. He also chipped in one rebound and one assist.\n\nSmith got 10 minutes of playing time on Saturday and finished with five points on 2-of-3 shooting and three assists.\n\nKnecht played five minutes and hit a 3-pointer, while the younger James got eight minutes on the court and missed both of his shot attempts while notching one assist.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Lakers player grades: L.A. loses big in Portland while short-handed",

    "description": "What stood out the most for Seattle?",
    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks dismantled the San Francisco 49ers in literally every phase of the game. In fact, this was tied for their most dominant playoff victory of all time, right alongside Super Bowl XLVIII.\n\nSeattle began the game with a bang, thanks to Rashid Shaheed's 95-yard kick return touchdown. From there, they never let their foot of the pedal for the remainder of the contest. The Seahawks ended San Francisco's season, and now they get to host the NFC Championship for the fourth time ever... and the first since the 2014 season. As always, we at Seahawks Wire take you through the top takeaways from each game, and we aren't slowing down now!\n\nOne game is one thing. Two is another. Three, and now four, is officially a pattern. Saturday night marked the fourth-straight game the Seahawks have rushed for at 160+ yards as a team. Against the 49ers, Seattle bulldozed their way to 175 on 33 carries. Leading the way was Kenneth Walker III, who had 116 of those yards and all three rushing touchdowns from the night. Backup Zach Charbonnet did leave the game with an injury and was unable to return, but head coach Mike Macdonald seemed optimistic about initial results.\n\nSam Darnold has been battling negative bias from the media and opposing fans all season long. This stems from how poorly he played in the Vikings' last two games to conclude the 2024 campaign - blowout losses in Week 18 and the Wild Card. Darnold proved doubters wrong with wins over the Rams and Niners to close out the 2025 season, but doubts persisted, especially with his sudden oblique issue landing him on the injury report. Darnold was totally solid on Saturday. He may not have blown anyone away, but with how this team is playing, completing 12-of-17 passes for 124 yards and a touchdown (a spectacular one at that!) is more than enough to keep the Seahawks competitive. Darnold will most assuredly continue to face these questions, although there may be less of them going into the NFC Championship.\n\nKupp has not been utilized this year like he had been throughout his time with the LA Rams. An outsider who does not watch Seahawks games each week might even be forgiven for thinking he's not much of an impact player anymore. However, for those who do, know what Kupp brings to the Seahawks. Against the 49ers, the Eastern Washington native reminded everyone he is a veteran with plenty of playoff experience. Kupp led Seattle with 60 yards on five receptions and gave the offense a presense at wide receiver opposite Jaxon Smith-Njigba the team needed.\n\nAs I mentioned in the introduction, the Seahawks are going to be playing in their fourth ever NFC Championship game. The three previous ones have all taken place at Qwest/CenturyLink/Lumen Field, and now a fourth will join the trio. Of course, I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't mention the Seahawks proved to be 3-0 in all of those NFC title games. Whoever emerges from the Rams/Bears game on Sunday will likely be considered a slim underdog at Lumen Field next week, and understandably so.\n\nIt's absurd he has never won this award yet. Think about what John Schneider brought to the Seahawks this year: Sam Darnold, Cooper Kupp, and DeMarcus Lawrence - who forced yet another fumble on Saturday night. Keep in mind Darnold and Kupp were replacements for Geno Smith and DK Metcalf. Not to mention the draft pick they received from Metcalf eventually became Nick Emmanwori, who recovered said fumble from Lawrence. Oh, let's not forget the Seahawks acquired Rashid Shaheed at the deadline. Getting a receiver was no on one's radar, but Schneider identified a way to elevate his team, and Shaheed has rewarded his faith with three return touchdowns in seven games. An absolute game changer. Also, even though they weren't this year, two other trade deadline acquisitions in the form of Leonard Williams and Ernest Jones IV were All-Pro players this year. Lastly, two of his previous first round picks from 2023, Devon Witherspoon and Jaxon Smith-Njigba, both made the Pro Bowl, and JSN was even first team All-Pro. There is simply no one else more deserving of the award, and the blowout win over San Francisco was seeing his mastery all pay off in one game.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Seahawks Wire: Seahawks vs 49ers: Top Seattle takeaways from Divisional Round",

    "description": "The French-born Fery, who is the son of a former tennis player and the president of football club Lorient, stunned an ill Flavio Cobolli on his main draw debut",
    "fullText": "Great Britain’s Arthur Fery claimed the first upset of the Australian Open as the qualifier knocked out 20th seed Flavio Cobolli in the first round.\n\nThe 23-year-old Fery, making his overseas grand slam debut, won 7-6 (1), 6-4, 6-1 to take out the rising star Cobolli, who took a medical timeout and was visited by the doctor as he struggled with a stomach bug.\n\nFery won his first-round match at last year’s Wimbledon, also beating the 20th seed in Australia’s Alexei Popyrin, after receiving a wildcard into the tournament.\n\nThis time, Fery has now scored four victories so far in Melbourne, having come through from the first round of qualifying, and will now take on Argentina’s Tomas Martín Etcheverry in the second round.\n\n“It seems I like drawing 20th seeds at grand slams,” Fery laughed afterwards during his on-court interview. “I felt great. I felt very comfortable on that court. Obviously playing three matches beforehand in quallies really helped.”\n\nRanked 186th in the world, Fery was born in France and his mother, Olivia Fery, was a professional tennis player. His father, Loic Fery, is a businessman and president of French top-flight football club FC Lorient.\n\n“It definitely really helped when I was younger in my development to have two parents who know how pro-sport works and the pressures of it,” said Fery, who is also fluent in French due to his parents.\n\n“Keeping a good balance between trying to develop tennis but also having a life and having an education and keeping your kid balanced when he is young. It’s very important. I'm very lucky for that.”\n\nHe went to school at King College in Wimbledon before enrolling at Stanford University in the United States on a tennis scholarship, a route also taken by the British No 2 Cameron Norrie and No 3 Jacob Fearnley (both Texas Christian University) in recent years.\n\nFery played for three years at Stanford, between 2020 and 2023, while also studying for a degree in science and technology, and became the No 1 ranked singles player in the college system during his second year.\n\n“It was a good experience. It's very different to going pro straightaway,” Fery said. “I think I wasn't quite ready for the pro tour at 18 when I came out of juniors.\n\n“I wasn't ready to travel 35, 40 weeks a year. So college was a great experience. You obviously get a world-class education at Stanford. At the same time you can play loads of matches, develop as a player.\n\n“You are left to your own a little bit more than if you have a travelling coach all the time with you. It's character-building for sure. I was lucky, very lucky, to be around great people and great coaches.\n\n“It's very individual. Some guys are ready to go all guns blazing 35 weeks a year travelling with a coach, or without. That's their identity. They are a tennis player from 18.\n\n“I was still in normal school until 16. I did A-levels, home school at home playing juniors. Tennis wasn't my life at 18. Now I feel like it is. It's my job.”\n\nFery made two appearances in the main draw at Wimbledon, his home tournament, before earning his first win over Popyrin at last year’s Championships. He lost to Luciano Darderi in the second round.\n\nBut Fery also took a step forwards in his career in September when he replaced the British No 1 Jack Draper and the injured Fearnley in Great Britain’s Davis Cup tie against Poland, beating Olaf Pieczkowski 6-4 6-2 in Gdynia.\n\nAlong with his first title on the Challenger circuit, Fery entered the 2026 season with a career-high ranking of 185 in the world - although he is already set to gain more than 50 places after beating Cobolli in the first round of the Australian Open.\n\nThe French-born Fery also said it was “satisfying” to produce a big result at the grand slams away from Wimbledon, where British players can receive wildcards and have the backing of the home crowds.\n\n“Obviously when you see the draw, you play a seed, you know you need your best tennis to get through. Maybe it was a good thing for me as well to know that I had to really play well and bring my best tennis today to have a chance. I thought I did that. I felt really at that level.\n\n“I was already happy to qualify here for my first time in the quallies of a slam on my own. Now coming through quallies and winning a round, I'm proud of it. I was hoping that at some point I was going to be able to play other slams without needing wildcards. So that's a good step forward for my career for sure.”\n\nAfter qualifying for the main draw, Fery’s mum flew out to Australia just in time for his match against Cobolli.\n\n“When I won that last round, she asked me if she could come,” Fery said. “It's obviously it's a long way, but at least I made it worth it. She can see at least two matches - hopefully more.”\n\nArgentina’s Etcheverry, who has a career-high ranking of 27 and beat Andy Murray on his final-ever match at the Australian Open.\n\nEtcheverry battled past Miomir Kecmanovic in five sets and Fery said: “He's been on tour for a while, so I know him. I've seen some matches, but not too much. I guess we'll speak about it with my coach and come with a good game plan.”",

    "fullText": "ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — Mikael Granlund scored at 4:02 of overtime, and the Anaheim Ducks beat the Los Angeles Kings 2-1 on Saturday night to sweep a two-game weekend set in the Freeway Faceoff rivalry.\n\nRookie Beckett Sennecke created the winning score by swooping in on a backcheck to take the puck away from Los Angeles' Kevin Fiala on a breakaway. Sennecke knocked the puck straight to Granlund, who beat Anton Forsberg for his ninth goal of the season.\n\nMason McTavish scored the first goal and Ville Husso made 17 saves for the Ducks. They have won three straight after a nine-game skid.\n\nAdrian Kempe scored a power-play goal and Forsberg stopped 30 shots in the backup's strong performance for the Kings, who have lost six of seven.\n\nSennecke played a major role for the second straight night when the Southern California clubs completed their back-to-back set by going to overtime for the third time in their four meetings this season. Sennecke had two assists and scored in the shootout as the Ducks rallied from a two-goal deficit for a 3-2 victory over the Kings in downtown Los Angeles on Friday night.\n\nMcTavish ended the Ducks' victory in LA with his fourth shootout goal of the season, and he opened the scoring in the rematch with a wrist shot for his 12th goal early in the first period.\n\nKempe tied it in the second period, scoring his 16th goal on a hard one-timer off a pass from Fiala. Kempe then put a gloved finger to his lips, shushing the sixth consecutive sellout crowd in Anaheim.\n\nLos Angeles had six power plays before the Ducks got their first man-advantage late in the second period, yet Anaheim had a significant edge in shots after carrying play for long stretches at even strength.\n\nAfter a scoreless third, the Kings played into extra time for a league-high 20th time this season.\n\nJeffrey Viel made his debut for the Ducks, who traded a fourth-round pick to Boston on Friday to get the veteran forward who hasn't scored in the NHL since March 18, 2022. The 6-foot-1 Viel fought 6-foot-6 Kings forward Samuel Helenius in the first period.\n\nKings: Host the New York Rangers on Tuesday night.\n\nDucks: Host the Rangers on Monday night.",

Hobbling to the locker room, his injury clouded the Oklahoma City Thunder for the rest of the way in their 122-120 loss to the Miami Heat.\n\nWilliams sustained the injury in the second quarter. Ajay Mitchell started the second half in his place. Eventually, the Thunder ruled him out for the remainder of the game due to right thigh soreness.\n\nThunder head coach Mark Daigneault said afterward they'll know \n\nOver the last handful of games, Williams has played his best basketball of the season. He's continued to work back from his surgically-repaired wrist. Now, you hope he doesn't miss too much time with his injury.\n\nIf so, that obviously is a bummer for the Thunder. Williams missed OKC's first 19 games recovering from his torn wrist ligaments that he played through in their championship run these past playoffs.

    "fullText": "Chelsea are reportedly interested in signing an Ivory Coast winger who has 3 goals in 9 games for his country so far.\n\nIt’s actually his only 9 games he’s had for Ivory Coast so far, having come up through the youth teams of his national side first.\n\nChelsea are mostly being linked with new centre backs right now for this transfer window, but we are hearing a lot about other positions being targeted in the summer probably, as well as any potential more opportunities arising this window.\n\nJanuary is a long month so they have plenty of time still to get some deals done, but this story is more than likely going to be one for the summer, of they do decide to make an attempt to try and sign him\n\nYan Diomande playing for RB Leipzig. (Photo by Stuart Franklin/Getty Images)\n\nAccording to Sky Germany, Chelsea among top clubs interested in RB Leipzig’s winger Yan Diomande.\n\nThe 19-year-old left winger has only been at Leipzig since the summer but already there are talks of the big clubs coming in for him – Chelsea being one of them.\n\nWe’ll see if anything goes any further on this one, but it’s clear that if this is a transfer that is going to happen then it will be for the summer of 2026 rather than this window now.\n\nObviously we had a game on yesterday with Chelsea beating Brentford 2-0 at Stamford Bridge in their latest Premier League match. It was a needed win, but it might have come at the cost of another injury to a defender, with Liam Rosenior putting the latest out on that after the game yesterday afternoon.\n\nCole Palmer’s poor recent form continued yesterday, but Rosenior has defended his attacking midfielder in the media and denied any suggestion of poor form.",

    "title": "Tough Breaks For American Teams at Dakar",
    "description": "Brabec misses winning by 2 seconds, Ford Raptors get lost, but American Polaris team wins again",
    "fullText": "A series of unfortunate events wound up costing American Honda rider Ricky Brabec the win in the motorcycle class of the 2026 Dakar rally, a race held for the seventh year in Saudi Arabia.\n\nAfter two weeks of racing over countless miles of sand and rocks, Argentine Luciano Benavides, riding a KTM, edged out American Ricky Brabec’s Honda by two seconds, the narrowest margin in the history of the event.\n\nIt was just the final cruel twist of fate Dakar had to deal out.\n\n“I have no idea why we lost, it makes no sense to me,” said two-time winner Brabec at the finish line, after he had congratulated Benavides.\n\nAh, but we have an idea. Several.\n\nFirst was camels. Brabec came upon a herd he estimated at 50-strong way out in a rocky section of that day’s stage. He couldn’t go around them because of the big rocks on either side of the dirt road, he couldn’t go through them because camels are really big, and he couldn’t even honk a horn because race bikes don’t have horns.\n\n“The camels were freakin’ in the road and I couldn’t go around them. I was like, ‘Damn, I don’t know what to do. I’m losing time right here.’ There were probably, like, 50 camels, right? So I’m like, ‘Dude I can’t go around, there’s, like, big black boulder rocks just everywhere,’ and I was like, ‘If I go out and try to risk going around the camels I’m gonna make it (the motorcycle) tip over, maybe smash something, twist an ankle or just something so stupid,’ so I just sat behind ‘em and I tried to get as close as I can and maybe they would shoo and go anywhere in the rocks. But yeah I was kinda bummed about this situation.”\n\nThen, on another day’s stage, Brabec stopped again, this time to help a fallen competitor. Australian KTM rider Daniel Sanders crashed 138 kilometers into the second half of Wednesday's marathon stage from Wadi ad Dawasir to Bisha, breaking his collarbone and sternum, according to abc.au.\n\n“I came over the dune and Tosh (Spanish Honda rider Tosha Schareina) came over the dune, and he (Sanders) was just kind of under his bike, stuck,” Brabec said. “So me and Tosh stopped. Tosh stopped at the top of the dune to make sure no one was coming to jump and land on him. Then I was down in the dune helping Daniel.”\n\nHe got that sorted out but, in the process, lost the lead. Sanders, being a tough Australian, got back on his bike… and finished the stage.\n\nNor did Brabec. He regained the lead in the following days and, until, just two kliks from the finish line, when he was in the lead by over three minutes and had only to cruise his Monster Energy Honda to the inflatable Red Bull arch and take his third Dakar win, something happened.\n\n“I navigated well all day,” Brabec said. “One route note, right here, two kilometers from the finish, I don’t know. I took the wrong left. The route book showed one left, so I took the left. It put me in a bad situation, and here we are.”\n\nOn the four-wheeled side of Dakar, meanwhile, it was a Dacia that won. Dacias are one of the cheapest cars you can buy in Europe, and the one you give a big sigh over when they assign it to you at the car rental counter at Charles de Gaulle. The somewhat diminutive Dacia Sandrider prototype looked like a little bug, but won it all over the mighty 2026 Ford Raptor T1 Ultimate Dakar Rally car and the equally mighty (and last year’s winner) Toyota Hilux.\n\nIt helped that it was driven by Qatari driver Nasser Al Attiyah, who had already won Dakar five times, this year making six.\n\nFord showed up at Dakar with four factory entries, while an additional four privateers also drove Raptors. It was the first year Ford came as an official factory team.\n\nThe trucks, too, had been upgraded.\n\n“The Ford Raptor T1+ itself represents the most complete expression yet of what we’ve learned through years of desert racing,” Ford said before the race. “It is lighter, more aerodynamically efficient, delivers dramatically improved visibility and control, and incorporates meaningful gains in suspension performance, cockpit access, and overall durability.”\n\nIn the early stages, Ford was doing well, swapping wins with Toyota’s Hilux trucks. But both Ford and Toyota didn’t show enough wins to last at the top of the leaderboard, and all the time Al Attiyah was moving up. While he won Stage 2, by his Stage 6 win, he seemed in strong contention to win it all. And despite Ford winning five stages and the prologue, navigation errors by Ford drivers, and smoother running by Al Attiyah throughout, meant the Qatari driver was the winner.\n\nIn SxS competition, as in Baja, it was American Brock Heger in the Loeb Fraymedia Motorsport Polaris RZR Factory Racing entry that claimed his second Dakar win in the class, after doing the same dominating dance in SCORE desert racing in Baja.\n\nIn the Stock class it was Defender Rally in its debut year, as drivers Rokas Baciuška and Oriol Vidal win in the Defender Dakar D7X‑R. Teammates Sara Price and Sean Berriman finished in second place, while ‘Mr Dakar’ Stéphane Peterhansel and co‑driver Mika Metge finished in fourth position in the Dakar Rally Stock class rankings.\n\n“Dakar Rally was just incredible,” said Price. “We had a goal at the final stage to get to the finish line as a team together. So to see the whole Defender team sitting there at the finish line and all their excitement and emotions, it just shows what this is all about and what it means. To get this team to the finish line in P1 and P2 is just, wow, incredible.”\n\nAs was the whole two-week adventure. If you can’t get enough of this off-road stuff, the SCORE King Shocks San Felipe 250 starts March 25-29 in Baja. But that’s an entirely different kind of racing.",

    "description": "Get out of the way or you’re going to get run over by the Seahawks!",
    "fullText": "That was supremely satisfying. Mike Macdonald loves his rallying cries, whether it’s “12 as one”, “Chasing Edges,” or “E.A.T.”. I’ve got another one for the Seattle Seahawks after that 41-6 dismantling of the San Francisco 49ers in the Division Round – Professional Destruction.\n\nThose two words embody Macdonald’s vision for the team and perfectly encapsulate the way Seattle has been playing for the last two months. ‘The Dark Side” defense has been utterly suffocating opposing offenses while the running game has been on a roll. For weeks I’ve been trying to find different ways to describe the dominance the Seahawks have been showcasing, particularly on the defensive side. The way Ken Walker is running behind this nasty offensive line, the offense also fully deserves the Professional Destruction moniker.\n\nKen Walker III is really damn good…historically good for the Seahawks playoffs actually.\n\n@Seahawks RB Kenneth Walker III tied the postseason franchise record with three rushing touchdowns. #GoHawks\n\n— Seahawks PR (@seahawksPR) January 18, 2026\n\nThe offensive line was giving him good creases and Walker was hitting the hole with burst. He also had some fantastic cutbacks and broke tackles on the way. Maybe the most emblematic run of how the Seahawks are playing right now was the one in the fourth quarter where he ran into a crowd and got pushed about five yards farther when the rest of the team got in on the action. The Seahawks are physically imposing their will on the opponents. I would take his stat line of 19 carries for 116 yards and 3 TDs any day.\n\nErnest Jones IV is really damn good. He singlehandedly caused two turnovers today, stripping the ball from Jake Tonges on Seattle’s second defensive drive and picked off Brock Purdy later in the game. He’s a tackling machine and is the leader in the middle of the defense getting everyone lined up. Picking up Jones in a trade last season is one of the best trades John Schneider has made as GM of the Seahawks.\n\nRashid Shaheed is really damn good. Speaking of great trades by John Schneider, the Shaheed trade is the gift that keeps on giving. His opening kickoff return for a TD was literally the game-winner, and was his third return TD since joining the Seahawks at the trade deadline. Shaheed also had a huge run on an end-around and drew a pass interference penalty. With Tory Horton’s injury, adding Shaheed has been a massive key to the Seahawks success this season.\n\nDeMarcus Lawrence is really damn good. He got to Brock Purdy on his first throw of the game, nearly forcing a fumble. Later, he blew up a fourth down play. Even later, he strip-sacked Purdy and the ball was recovered by Nick Emmanwori. Tank came to the Seahawks because he thought they had a chance to win the Super Bowl. He’s doing his best to make that a reality.\n\nPlayoff Cooper Kupp is awesome. His stat line of 5 catches for 60 yards might not be the most impressive, but all of them seemed to come at crucial times. Kupp was the reliable safety blanket that everyone hoped he would be after signing with his hometown team.\n\nThe tight ends didn’t have any catches today, but they all blocked their asses off. AJ Barner and Eric Saubert were both throwing key blocks on the outside runs that Walker was so effective with against the 49ers. That kind of selfless play is why those guys are beloved.\n\nIt was good to see Charles Cross and Coby Bryant back out there. Bryant finished the game, unlike Cross, but hopefully it was just precautionary with Charles. Zach Charbonnet was injured as well, but the initial prognosis was somewhat hopeful. He’s a huge part of the third down packages and a touchdown machine, so having him miss time would hurt the offense.\n\nThe offensive line blocked really well again today as evidenced by the 175 yards rushing, the fourth week in a row that Seattle ran for 150+ yards. At this point, I don’t think it’s a fluke. No better time for the run game to come alive than at the most important time of the season!\n\nSeattle will host the NFC Championship game for the first time in over a decade and got damn does it feel good! Whether it’s the third matchup with the Los Angeles Rams or a showdown with the No. 2 seed Chicago Bears, it’s sure to be a wild atmosphere. Until then, enjoy this one folks. This is a special, special team!",

    "fullText": "This article originally appeared in The Conversation.\n\nIf you were to visit a bookshop in the ancient world, what would it be like?\n\nYou don’t just have to imagine it. The ancient Roman writer Aulus Gellius, who lived in the 2nd century CE, gives us a number of descriptions of his adventures at bookstores. In one passage, he describes an encounter at one in Rome, which he was visiting with a poet friend:\n\nI chanced to be sitting in a bookshop in the Sigillaria with the poet Julius Paulus […] There was on sale there the Annals of Quintus Fabius Pictor in a copy of good and undoubted age, which the dealer maintained was without errors.\n\nGellius then tells us that, while they are sitting there, another customer enters the shop. The new customer has a disagreement with the dealer. He complains that he “found in the book one error”. The dealer says that’s impossible. Then the customer brings out evidence to prove the dealer wrong.\n\nIn different passage, Aulus tells us about some bookstalls he came across when he arrived by ship at the port of Brundisium on the Adriatic coast. The books, he records, were “in Greek, filled with marvellous tales, things unheard of, incredible […] The writers were ancient and of no mean authority”.\n\nThe volumes themselves, however, were filthy from neglect, in bad condition and unsightly. Nevertheless, I drew near and asked their price; then, attracted by their extraordinary and unexpected cheapness, I bought a large number of them for a small sum.\n\nAulus goes on to describe in excited language all the weird facts he derived from these books – like how people in Africa can “work spells by voice and tongue” and through this witchcraft cause people, animals, trees and crops to die.\n\nThese sorts of stories bring us close to how ordinary people in ancient Greek and Roman times obtained books and engaged with books. But if we read stories like this it might lead us to want to know more. How did books and writing come into existence? And how were books written and produced?\n\nMany people in the ancient world thought that writing had been invented by gods or heroes. For example, the ancient Egyptians believed the god Thoth was the first to create signs to represent spoken sounds.\n\nThe origins of writing are certainly mysterious. It’s unclear when writing began and who invented it.\n\nThe earliest written text is a wooden tablet radiocarbon dated to before 5000 BCE. This is known as the Dispilio tablet, because it was discovered at a neolithic lakeside settlement at Dispilio in Greece. It is carved with strange linear markings. These have not been deciphered, but most scholars think they are a form of writing.\n\nEvidence for writing appears early in different parts of the world. In Mesopotamia and Egypt, the oldest texts, such as the Kish limestone tablet at Uruk or the Narmer Palette at Hierakonpolis, date to before 3000 BCE. In the Indus Valley, the Harappan script, which remains undeciphered, appeared around the same time. In China, the earliest characters, the Dawenkou graphs, also date to around 3000 BCE.\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of early writing is that there is such a variety of different scripts. For example, the earliest known texts in the Greek language are written in the Linear B script, which was used from around 1500-1200 BCE, and wasn’t deciphered until 1952. Linear B is not an alphabet, but a syllabary of more than 80 different signs. A syllabary is a kind of writing system where each sign represents a syllable.\n\nOur English alphabet comes from the Romans, who in the 8th and 7th century BCE also got their alphabet from the Phoenicians, via the Greeks.\n\nPeople in ancient times used many different things as writing materials.\n\nThe Roman writer Pliny the Elder (23-79 CE) tells us that the earliest people in the world\n\nused to write on palm-leaves and then on the bark of certain trees, and afterwards folding sheets of lead began to be employed for official muniments, and then also sheets of linen or tablets of wax for private documents.\n\nHowever, the most popular writing material in the ancient Mediterranean was papyrus, from which we get our word “paper”.\n\nTo make papyrus, you get the pith of the papyrus plant (Cyperus papyrus), cut it into slender strips, then press it together. Once dried, it forms a thin sheet that you can write on.\n\nPapyrus sheets were usually glued together into rolls. These rolls could be very long. Some of the most lavish Egyptian papyrus rolls were more than 10 metres long, such as the recently discovered Waziri Papyrus containing parts of the Book of the Dead.\n\nWhen papyri were rolled up they were stored in shelves or boxes. Labels were attached to the handles of the papyri so you could identify their contents. In his play Linus, Greek playwright Alexis (c. 375-275 BC) has one character tell another how to look through a bunch of rolls to find what he wants:\n\ngo over and pick any papyrus roll you like out of there and then read it… examining them quietly, and at your leisure, on the basis of the labels. Orpheus is in there, Hesiod, tragedies, Choerilus, Homer, Epicharmus, prose treatises of every type…\n\nPapyrus seems flimsy to the eye, but it is a durable writing material, stronger than modern paper. Many papyri have survived for thousands of years stored in jars or sarcophagi or buried under the sand.\n\nThe oldest surviving papyrus text is the so-called Diary of Merer (which you can listen to here), the logbook of a man named Merer, who was an inspector during the construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza under Pharaoh Khufu. This papyrus, which dates to around 2600 BCE, gives a day-by-day account of how Merer and his team of about 200 men spent time hauling and transporting stone and doing other work.\n\nPapyrus was susceptible to being eaten by insects or mice. But there were ways to prevent this. Pliny the Elder, for example, advises that sheets of papyrus soaked in citrus-oil won’t be eaten by moths.\n\nIf you were living in ancient Greece or Rome and wanted to write a book, how would you do it?\n\nFirst, you would buy sheets or rolls of papyrus to write on. If you couldn’t afford it, you’d have to write on the back or in the margins of papyri you already owned.\n\nIf you didn’t own any papyri already, then you would have to write on other materials. According to the Greek historian Diogenes Laertius (3rd century CE), the philosopher Cleanthes (c. 331-231 BCE) “wrote down lectures on oyster-shells and the blade-bones of oxen through lack of money to buy papyrus”.\n\nSecond, you would get your ink. In the ancient world, there were many varieties of ink. Normal black ink was made from the soot of burnt resin or pitch mixed with vegetable gum. When buying ink, it would come in powder form, and you would need to mix it with water before using it.\n\nThird, you would get your pen. It would be made from reed, hence it was called the “calamus” by Greeks and Romans (“calamus” is the Greek word for reed). To sharpen your pen you would need a knife. If you made a mistake, you would erase it with a wet sponge.\n\nNow you have all the materials you need. However, you don’t need to use the pen and papyrus yourself. If you want, you can get a scribe to write down your words for you.\n\nThe Greek orator Dio Chrysostom (c.40-110 CE) even advised writers not to use the pen themselves:\n\nWriting I do not advise you to engage in with your own hand, or only very rarely, but rather to dictate to a secretary.\n\nIf you needed to consult other books while writing, you could get friends to send them to you or ask book dealers to make you a copy. In a papyrus from the 2nd century CE found at Oxyrhynchus, Egypt, and written in Greek, the writer asks his friend to find the books that he needs and make copies of them. Otherwise, you would go to a library, though the best libraries at Alexandria, Rome and Athens might be far away.\n\nWhen you finished drafting your book you would need to revise and correct it. You could then publish it by having many copies made by scribes and delivering these copies to friends and booksellers.\n\nWhen all this was done, your book would be out in public. Perhaps someone like Aulus Gellius would stumble across it in a busy Roman bookshop. Maybe he’d even buy it.",

    "fullText": "Call me old-fashioned, but hardly a day goes by where I'm not thinking about the ARPANET.\n\nI mean, c'mon, it's the dang ARPANET - the precursor to today's Internet, basically marking the beginnings of disparate computer systems talking to each other, of people talking to each other through computers, concocted way back in 1969. If you look at what people were doing on the ARPANET almost immediately (and even earlier on similar systems like University of Illinois's PLATO), you'll see that the ARPANET was a harbinger for all the games and e-commerce and apps and whatnot that we rely on every single second of every single day. How can you not be thinking about this stuff all the time?\n\nSince I've already written somewhat of a love-letter to the World Wide Web in our post explaining how Folio connects with suppliers, I'd like to now continue this theme of computer history affection with a dive into one of the earlier protocols from the ARPANET era. It's a protocol that still powers many procurement workflows like order processing, catalog sharing, invoicing, and more.\n\nThat's right, it's the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) - invented in 1971 - along with its more secure, late '90s sibling: SFTP.\n\nAnd, rest assured, we're not just spelunking into these Internet protocols for the sake of it (though there's nothing wrong with that), we're going to be actively giving context for some of the advantages of leveraging Folio's API + web-based lightning integrations for procure-to-pay workflows, while still paying respect to traditional SFTP file drops. Along the way, we're going to code up a few toy examples to understand why SFTP is more secure than FTP, as well as what the heck people mean when they talk about those daily or weekly SFTP \"sweeps\" (and, crucially, why it's hard to figure out if they worked or not!).\n\nIf you're a fellow ARPANET history buff, you're already familiar with RFCs (Request for Comments). For the uninitiated, RFCs are basically the history of the Internet, one technical design doc at a time (see, they're not just for FAANG promo packets). And, guess what, they're all online for anyone to read! I'll prove it - here's the first RFC on FTP - RFC 114.\n\nRFC 114, published in 1971 — eighteen years before the World Wide Web — established FTP as a protocol for transferring files between computers over a network. Many more RFCs were published over time on FTP, honing its implementation as the ARPANET and eventually the Internet evolved into what we know (and sorta love) today.\n\nFTP, as defined in its RFCs, uses a client-server architecture with two separate connections:\n\nControl connection (port 21): Where you send commands like \"list directory\" or \"upload this file\"\n\nData connection (port 20): Where the actual file content flows\n\nFrom these early specifications to the present day with SFTP, the basic file transfer UX of this protocol remains largely the same: a user connects to an server, authenticates with credentials, navigates through directories, and transfers files.\n\nIndeed, so much so that I was using FTP back in the mid '90s without even realizing it.\n\nImagine this scene: you've just hit *save* on the last edit to your personal homepage in Notepad or BBEdit (or let's be honest, Dreamweaver). Your site's got some <marquee> and <blink> tags, a page views hit counter, and definitely an \"Under Construction\" GIF. Probably also this classic:\n\nSo now what? Is your cool website \"on-line\" yet? Nope! Apparently, you need to get this HTML file thing from your family's Gateway 2000 computer onto, quote, your \"web host's server\" (whatever that means…) so your friends can check out your site.\n\nAfter talking to your web hosting provider's support hotline, they send you an email with your FTP credentials:\n\nYou dutifully follow along with the provided instructions, firing up a dedicated FTP client app, plugging in these credentials, and connecting to their server. The FTP client interface shows two panes side by side—your local home computer on the left, and the remote web server on the right.\n\nYou can see folders and files on some server probably thousands of miles away, and you can drag and drop files between your computer and that remote machine.\n\nYou drag index.html from left to right, watch a progress bar fill up, and boom—your website is live. Navigate to http://www.geocities.com/your_username and there's your homepage! You hit refresh a couple dozen times to get that counter up (at least that's what I always did).\n\nBut easy wasn't the problem with FTP. It's that everything in FTP is transmitted in plaintext (aka human-readable, unencrypted text).\n\nEvery time Dreamweaver connected to your GeoCities web server via FTP:\n\nYour welcome123 password flew across the Internet unencrypted\n\nThe contents of the website site (e.g. index.html) transferred unencrypted\n\nSomeone at your ISP, your hosting provider, or anywhere in between could theoretically read everything\n\nFor personal hobby sites, most folks didn't care (or were largely unaware of any issue). But you can imagine how this would be a problem for anything commerce-related (for example, imagine if the file contents were actually meant to be something private, rather than an HTML file for public consumption).\n\nSince we're big fans of procurement at Folio, let's put this issue into procure-to-pay terms.\n\nImagine you're a food supplier for hotels and restaurants. You'd like to share your *EDI 832 Price/Sales Catalog* file with a procurement platform so that your customers can view your products and place purchase orders with you.\n\nEDI (Electronic Data Interchange) is the idea of businesses exchanging structured electronic documents to facilitate workflows that were previously done via paper. Think purchase orders, invoices, catalogs, etc. EDI files are very commonly exchanged via SFTP.\n\nEvery week, you connect to the procurement platform's FTP server to transfer your latest EDI X12 832 catalog file, which contains your customer specific catalog, including special negotiated pricing for each of your items with each of your hotel customers.\n\nIf you were to transmit this file via FTP, then all of your catalog information flows across the Internet in plaintext (aka plain, readable, unencrypted text that anyone could understand). That means that anyone with network access along the path of your transmission could:\n\nCapture your login credentials and access this FTP server\n\nIntercept sensitive business information, including your negotiated pricing and item availability\n\nIt's easy to see how this lack of encryption would be problematic. As commerce and other sensitive workflows like finance gained in popularity on the ARPANET and Internet, it became increasingly obviously that transmitting credentials and business data in plaintext was going to be unacceptable.\n\nLet's try this out ourselves in an educational toy demo to see this security issue with FTP directly.\n\nFor the technically-inclined, I'll assume you're following along on a modern Mac with uv installed (it's a modern Python package / project manager that simplifies a lot of the traditional Python headaches) as well as Homebrew.\n\nIn three separate terminal windows, we're going to:\n\nRun an FTP server locally on our computer\n\nListen to local \"internet\" traffic on our computer using tcpdump\n\nConnect to the local FTP server, as if were planning to transfer a file!\n\nIf all goes well with our demo, we should be able to see the plaintext credentials being sent to the FTP server in terminal #2, demonstrating the plaintext vulnerability with FTP.\n\nIn terminal #1, let's run the pyftpdlib package (a Python FTP server) to start a local FTP server:\n\nIn terminal #2, we can start listening to internet traffic with tcpdump and we'll even filter it down just to look for the FTP credentials.\n\nIn terminal #3, we can now connect to our local FTP server (still running in Terminal #1) with the lftp app (which you'll likely have to first install with Homebrew):\n\nFinally, back in terminal #2, which is still sitting there, listening to internet traffic and searching for the phrase USER or PASS, you should now see the unencrypted username testuser and the unencrypted password testpass123 printed out directly.\n\nUh-oh! It's easy to imagine a real world scenario here — you can see how transmitting these credentials in plaintext makes it easier for someone to gain access to your company's purchase order system. This issue with FTP is clearly not a good situation for serious business applications, like procurement or invoicing workflows.\n\nWhich now brings us to the 1990s, when a new idea emerged for remote computing and file transfers onto the Internet RFC scene: SSH and SFTP.\n\nSFTP stands for SSH File Transfer Protocol (thought it's sometimes incorrectly referred to as Secure File Transfer Protocol). Despite the similarity in names, SFTP is not FTP with encryption attached. Instead, it's an entirely separate protocol designed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as an extension of the SSH (Secure Shell) protocol (first specified in RFC 4250 back in 1995).\n\nSFTP uses a single encrypted connection over port 22 (the same port that SSH uses) to handle both commands and data transfer.\n\nSSH handshake: The client initiates a connection to the server on port 22\n\nAuthentication: The server verifies the client's identity using either username/password, SSH keys, or both\n\nEncrypted tunnel: SSH establishes an encrypted tunnel where all subsequent data flows\n\nSFTP subsystem: Within this secure tunnel, the SFTP protocol handles file operations\n\nPerhaps one of the greatest benefits of this approach is that everything - authentication credentials, file contents, and even directory listings - is encrypted end-to-end. A listener on the network would see nothing but encrypted gibberish. This is why many workflows (in procurement and beyond) use SFTP for transferring files to this day.\n\nImportantly, SFTP isn't just about moving files from one computer to another. You can do quite a bit:\n\nget / put: Download and upload files\n\nls / mkdir: List directories and create folders\n\nrename / rm: Rename and delete files\n\nresume: Resume interrupted transfers (a lifesaver on unreliable connections)\n\nWith these building-blocks, developers have built some really nice UIs for SFTP that feel exactly like using your local computer's file system (I'm thinking of Panic's Transmit app, for one). But you can also stick to the command line if that's your thing!\n\nFor example, in procurement workflows, a typical SFTP interaction might look like this.\n\nWe're first grabbing the latest catalog file with that get command, and then we're dropping in a purchase order for the supplier with the put command. The specific format of these files really depends on what the supplier expects or requires. As mentioned earlier, many procure-to-pay workflows leverage some form of an EDI specification — but these vary quite widely in practice (EDI merits a whole other blog post, to be fair - I'll pencil this in now for the future).\n\nAnyway, in practice (hopefully), no one is really typing in these SFTP commands at 2 AM. That's what computers are for, silly! Here's where automation comes in.\n\nIn procurement SFTP integrations, \"sweeps\" or \"polling\" refers to the automated process of periodically checking a folder for new files. It's the mechanism that keeps EDI and other SFTP procurement workflows humming along without human intervention.\n\nHere's how a typical catalog sweep works:\n\nSupplier maintains an SFTP server with designated folders\n\nHotel's procurement system has credentials to access specific folders on the supplier's SFTP server\n\nA background job is configured by the hotel's procurement system to \"sweep\" the catalog folder every week (or on whichever cadence the supplier updates their catalog).\n\nAt scheduled time (say, 2:00 AM), the procurement system connects via SFTP\n\nIt lists all files in the /outgoing/catalog folder\n\nFor each file, it checks: \"Have I seen this file before?\" likely using some pattern in the filename\n\nNew files are downloaded and processed\n\nOptionally, processed files are moved to an /archive folder or deleted\n\nSystem waits until next scheduled sweep next week\n\nHopefully it's obvious that there's no real-time notification. The supplier's server doesn't \"push\" files to the hotel. The procurement system has to periodically \"ask\" if anything new has arrived. It's like checking your mailbox instead of waiting for a doorbell.\n\nYou'll also see sweeps in the other direction, where a procurement platform drops new purchase orders into a folder on a supplier's SFTP server, and the supplier \"sweeps\" them out every minute or so for order processing. And, hopefully, at that point, it all works, that all the products are available and nothing's out of stock, and the purchase order goes through without a hitch, but we'll get into each of these potential issues in a bit.\n\nFor now, let's try out sweeping ourselves.\n\nLet's set up a local SFTP server using Docker. We'll be able to see exactly how files appear and disappear during sweep operations.\n\nFirst, create a simple configuration file called sftp.json. We'll feed this config into our SFTP server (it sets up our simple username and password, for example).\n\nBecause I'm really nice, here's a one-liner to create that file:\n\nNow we can spin up an SFTP server using the open-source emberstack/sftp Docker image:\n\nGreat, now we should have an SFTP server running on localhost:2222.\n\nLet's connect to our local server:\n\nTry creating a file locally and watching it appear in the SFTP server (this happens via the config setup with Docker).\n\nBack in our SFTP session, let's grab this file.\n\nPretty basic stuff, I suppose. But still cool. We navigated to a directory in an SFTP server and transmitted a file from the SFTP server to our local computer, just like you would in a procurement catalog sweep.\n\nNow let's write some automation!\n\nWe are going to make our own SFTP sweep script.\n\nFirst, let's set up SSH key authentication for our script (which is more secure and automation-friendly than passwords).\n\nWhy SSH keys? SSH key authentication is strongly preferred over passwords for automated systems. Keys can't be accidentally typed incorrectly, they can be rotated without updating credentials in multiple places, and they provide non-repudiation (you know exactly which system made each connection).\n\nThis creates two files: supplier_key (private key) and supplier_key.pub (public key).\n\nWe're using Ed25519 here because it is a modern, elliptic curve-based algorithm that's more secure than traditional RSA keys while using much shorter key lengths (256 bits vs 2048+ bits for RSA).\n\nNow we need to configure our SFTP server to accept this key. To do this, we can update our sftp.json file with this command:\n\nNow we need to copy our public key into the server's authorized keys. First, stop your existing container:\n\nIf you've connected to localhost:2222 before (perhaps from earlier in this tutorial), you'll want to clean up the old host key to avoid SSH warnings:\n\nCreate the SSH directory structure and copy your public key:\n\nRestart the SFTP server with the updated configuration:\n\nNow create a file called sweep.sh with these contents:\n\nThe -i ./supplier_key flag tells SFTP to use our private key for authentication instead of prompting for a password. This is exactly how automated procurement systems authenticate—no human interaction required!\n\nRun this script and watch as it periodically checks for new CSV files. Drop some CSV files into sftp-data/outgoing/ and watch them get picked up on the next sweep and downloaded into your downloads folder.\n\nAre you now a procurement platform? Are you now a supplier platform? Probably not, but this is still pretty cool.\n\nAs we've just seen, SFTP sweeps work reliably for what they're designed to do: batch file transfers on a schedule. But they introduce fundamental limitations that can impact modern, real-time procure-to-pay workflows.\n\nWhen you submit a purchase order via SFTP, here's what typically happens:\n\nYour procurement system uploads PO-12345.xml to the supplier's /incoming/orders folder\n\nEventually (1 minute? 30 minutes? 2 hours? Next business day?) the supplier platform sweeps the SFTP folder and processes the batch\n\nThey drop PO-12345-confirmation.xml in their /outgoing/orders folder\n\nYou finally learn if the order was accepted or if there were errors from out of stock items, etc.\n\nCompare this to a modern API where you'd get an immediate response:\n\nLet's say you submit an order with an invalid product SKU. With SFTP:\n\nOrder uploads successfully (file transfer succeeded)\n\nSome time later, you get an error file back\n\nNow you need to correlate that error with the original order\n\nRe-submit a corrected order with that item removed or error resolved\n\nWith synchronous APIs, you'd know immediately that SKU \"12345A\" should be \"12345-A\" and could fix it on the spot.\n\nYour system likely needs to track: \"Which files have I already processed?\" This leads to complex state management:\n\nMaintain a database of processed filenames\n\nHandle edge cases (what if a file is re-uploaded with the same name?)\n\nDeal with archive folder management\n\nDebug when files mysteriously reprocess\n\nWhen something goes wrong, debugging is harder:\n\n\"Did the file get uploaded?\" (Check your local logs)\n\n\"Did they receive it?\" (Ask the supplier to check their folder)\n\n\"Did they process it?\" (Wait for their response file... eventually)\n\n\"What went wrong?\" (Parse cryptic error codes from a text file)\n\nCompare this to modern API-based systems, which includes Folio's lightning automations, where you typically get:\n\nImmediate success/failure responses\n\nStatus endpoints to check processing state\n\nReal-time web-hooks for completion notifications\n\nGiven these limitations, why does SFTP persist in procurement? A few reasons:\n\nIt's battle-tested: SFTP has been around since the late 1990s and works reliably for what it's good at\n\nIt's firewall-friendly: One port (22) is easier for IT to approve than multiple ports\n\nIt's universally supported: Every major platform has SFTP clients and servers\n\nIt's good enough: For many batch-oriented workflows, hourly or weekly sweeps are sufficient\n\nIt's file-based: Files are easy to archive, audit, and replay if something goes wrong\n\nLow barrier to entry: Setting up SFTP is often simpler and cheaper for IT teams to enable than building APIs\n\nSFTP indeed provides a lowest-common-denominator solution that scales for many procurement workflows.\n\nSFTP isn't going away anytime soon, and that's good! It serves an important role in commerce integrations where batch processing makes sense.\n\nAt Folio, we're flexible — we use SFTP integrations all the time for compatibility with supplier and ERP systems, while also increasingly building real-time API integrations and Folio Lightning Automations to augment some of the concerns with file-based catalogs and purchase orders transferred with SFTP.\n\nFor example, with Folio Lightning Automations, a supplier EDI catalog feed provided via SFTP can be augmented with a Folio Lightning Automation to add real-time stock availability and other enhancements, like product images, that aren't typically included in EDI standards but may be available on a supplier's website. This hybrid approach creates a better user experience for our mutual customers and can drive more sales towards those suppliers, and requires no additional work from suppliers.\n\nWe're excited at Folio to continue collaborating with suppliers to bridge the gap between file-based standards and web-based APIs for more responsive, real-time procurement workflows that serve our hospitality customers.\n\nHopefully, at this point, the next time you're in a meeting and someone mentions \"the weekly catalog sweep\" or \"EDI invoices,\" you'll know exactly what's happening at 2 AM: a reliable, secure, wonderfully-vintage file transfer that keeps procurement moving forward, one batch at a time.\n\nAnd, if you do find yourself working with SFTP regularly, these tools can make your life easier:\n\nTransmit by Panic (macOS): Hands down the most elegant SFTP client I've used. The dual-pane interface makes it feel like working in Finder, and the sync features are incredibly powerful. Perfect for one-off file management.\n\nCyberduck (macOS/Windows): Free, open-source, and supports SFTP plus a dozen other protocols (S3, Azure, etc.). Great for quick connections and bookmarking frequent servers.\n\nFileZilla (Cross-platform): The old reliable. Not the prettiest UI, but it works everywhere and handles the basics well.\n\nemberstack/sftp Docker image: Modern, well-maintained, JSON-based configuration. Great for integration testing in CI/CD pipelines.\n\natmoz/sftp Docker image: Lightweight alternative, command-line based configuration. Perfect for quick local testing.\n\nHave questions about SFTP, EDI, or Lightning Integrations? Or just want to learn more about how Folio connects with suppliers? Drop us a line—we'd love to chat. We're also hiring for engineers!",

    "title": "Trump 25% tariff on European allies until Denmark sells Greenland to US",
    "description": "Heads of state across Europe respond in solidarity with Denmark and Greenland, and boycott of World Cup suggested",
    "fullText": "Heads of state across Europe respond in solidarity with Denmark and Greenland, and boycott of World Cup suggested\n\nDonald Trump threatened a 25% tariff on a slew of European countries including Denmark, Germany, France and the UK – until the US is allowed to purchase Greenland, in an extraordinary escalation of the president’s bid to claim the autonomous Danish territory.\n\nIn a lengthy post on Saturday on Truth Social, Trump said he would impose a 10% tariff on Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland beginning 1 February, “on any and all goods sent to the United States of America”.\n\nHe said the tariff will increase to 25% on 1 June.\n\n“This Tariff will be due and payable until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,” Trump said.\n\nThe president’s longstanding interest in acquiring Greenland “one way or the other” has become a fixation since the US raid that captured Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro earlier in January. While he has claimed the Arctic territory’s current status poses a national security threat to the US, this has been disputed by US allies, including Denmark.\n\nIn the Saturday morning post, Trump said forces from the eight European nations “have journeyed to Greenland, for purposes unknown”. It was an apparent reference to Nato allies deploying troops in Greenland on Thursday in response to Trump’s threats to forcefully take the Arctic island, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark.\n\n“The President’s statement comes as a surprise,” Lars Løkke Rasmussen, Denmark’s foreign minister, responded on social media. “Earlier this week, we had a constructive meeting with Vice President Vance and Secretary Rubio. The purpose of the increased military presence in Greenland, to which the President refers, is to enhance security in the Arctic.”\n\n“Every insult, threat, tariff and lie that we receive strengthens our resolve,” Rasmus Jarlov, the conservative chair of Denmark’s defence committee, wrote in more direct language. “The answer from Denmark and Greenland is final: We will never hand over Greenland. We pray that our true allies will stand with us because we are going to need it.”\n\nThe tariff threat against Nato allies united the leaders of those nations in unusually blunt language, after months of treading carefully for fear of triggering the volatile US president’s rage.\n\nIn response to Trump’s comments on Saturday, the EU commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said in a statement that the Europeans “have consistently underlined our shared transatlantic interest in peace and security in the Arctic, including through NATO. The pre-coordinated Danish exercise, conducted with allies, responds to the need to strengthen Arctic security and poses no threat to anyone.”\n\n“The EU stands in full solidarity with Denmark and the people of Greenland,” she added. “Tariffs would undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.”\n\n“Our position on Greenland is very clear – it is part of the Kingdom of Denmark and its future is a matter for the Greenlanders and the Danes,” the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, said. “Applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of Nato allies is completely wrong. We will of course be pursuing this directly with the US administration.”\n\nEmmanuel Macron, the French president, drew an implicit comparison between Trump’s threats to seize Greenland and Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. “No intimidation or threat will influence us – neither in Ukraine, nor in Greenland, nor anywhere else in the world when we are confronted with such situations,” Macron wrote in a social media riposte to Trump.\n\nFinland’s president, Alexander Stubb, whose excellence at golf previously made him something of a Trump whisperer, echoed the warning about a potential “downward spiral”.\n\n“We will not let ourselves be blackmailed,” the Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, added. That sentiment was echoed by Norway’s prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, who wrote: “Threats have no place among allies.”\n\nGermany’s leadership was more reserved, with the German chancellor Friedrich Merz leaving it to his spokesperson, Stefan Kornelius, to say only that the government “has taken note of” Trump’s statements and plans to coordinate with allies to “decide on appropriate responses at the appropriate time”.\n\nOn Friday, however, a spokesperson on foreign policy for the chancellor’s Christian Democrat party, Jürgen Hardt, suggested that Germany could threaten to boycott the World Cup Trump is hosting this summer “as a last resort in order to get Trump to see sense on the Greenland issue”. Polling done before Trump’s latest threat for the popular German tabloid Bild revealed broad support for a World Cup boycott, with 47% of Germans in favor and just 35% against, should the US annex Greenland.\n\nEven before the new tariff threat, there were mass protests in Greenland and Denmark on Saturday against Trump’s efforts to “acquire” the island.\n\nHis latest tariff threat comes just eight months after Trump announced that he had struck a trade pact with the UK – and six months after he announced a pact with the European Union.\n\nThe UK would have protection against future US tariffs “because I like them”, Trump declared in the summer. He described the pact with the EU as a “powerful deal” and an “important” partnership.\n\nTrump’s sudden reversal on Saturday even managed to alienate one of his biggest fans, Nigel Farage, the leader of the rightwing, anti-immigrant party Reform UK. “We don’t always agree with the US government and in this case we certainly don’t. These tariffs will hurt us,” Farage wrote.\n\nThere was also criticism from Trump’s own Republican party. Thom Tillis, a US senator from North Carolina, called the president’s threat “bad for America” but “great for Putin, Xi and other adversaries who want to see Nato divided”.\n\n“The fact that a small handful of ‘advisers’ are actively pushing for coercive action to seize territory of an ally is beyond stupid,” Tillis added.\n\nThe president has repeatedly turned to tariffs in a bid to force countries to bend to his will – with some success. Days after returning to office for his second term in early 2025, Colombia agreed to accept military aircraft carrying deported migrants after Trump threatened steep duties on the country’s exports to the US.\n\nTrump, who has previously extolled the benefits of tariffs as a negotiating tool, stressed on Saturday that the US was “immediately open to negotiation” with Denmark and any of the countries it was threatening to hit with these new tariffs.\n\nHis aggressive global trade strategy has raised fears for the US economy, which analysts and policymakers have warned could face significant damage from sweeping tariffs on the world.\n\nWhile the White House has played down such concerns, a vast wave of tariffs unveiled by Trump last spring – when he proclaimed the start of a new era for the US economy – was quickly reversed as global markets fell sharply.\n\nBut his administration’s erratic rollout of other tariffs nevertheless significantly strained US trade ties with the world. Americans now face an overall average effective tariff rate of 16.8%, according to the Budget Lab at Yale, the highest level since 1935.\n\nThe Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said recently that Greenland’s defence is a “common concern” for the whole of Nato. The Guardian reported that European troops had deployed to Greenland, in part, to establish what a more sustained ground deployment on the territory could look like, and partly to reassure the US that European Nato members were serious about Arctic security.\n\nFewer than one in five of Americans approve of Trump’s efforts to acquire Greenland, a poll published on Thursday by Reuters/Ipsos found. Both Democrats and Republicans oppose the effort, and only 4% of Americans think the US should take Greenland using military force.\n\nMuch of Trump’s wider trade strategy is currently in the hands of the US supreme court, which is mulling whether the imposition of many of his tariffs was legal. A decision could be announced as early as next week.",

    "description": "Post-training alignment often reduces LLM diversity, leading to a phenomenon known as mode collapse. Unlike prior work that attributes this effect to algorithmic limitations, we identify a fundamental, pervasive data-level driver: typicality bias in preference data, whereby annotators systematically favor familiar text as a result of well-established findings in cognitive psychology. We formalize this bias theoretically, verify it on preference datasets empirically, and show that it plays a central role in mode collapse. Motivated by this analysis, we introduce Verbalized Sampling, a simple, training-free prompting strategy to circumvent mode collapse. VS prompts the model to verbalize a probability distribution over a set of responses (e.",

    "fullText": "Back in 1993, Shoshanna Lonstein Gruss, then just Shoshanna Lonstein, became a tabloid darling because she dated Jerry Seinfeld at the height of his sitcom fame.\n\nThat was before you could be social media famous, but essentially, she was one of the first influencers, and she parlayed the fame of her four-year relationship into a successful career as a fashion designer.\n\nLonstein Gruss was a rare person, back in those days, who managed to turn fame by association into a real career. Her Shoshanna clothing brand was respected and enduring, not an attempt to capitalize on her name recognition, as happened with Monica Lewinsky's handbag line, or in a more recent example, Mike \"The Situation\" Sorrentino's \"Situation Nation” clothing line.\n\nShoshanna operates its own store, while also being sold at retailers including Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, and Bloomingdale's. It also has some items for sale on Amazon.\n\nNow the retail brand has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, on the same day that Saks Global and Neiman Marcus also filed. (It's important to note that the company behind the Shoshanna brand uses a slightly different spelling — i.e., Shoshanah Fashions.)\n\nLonstein Gruss may have started as a tabloid figure, but she has a deep history as a respected fashion designer.\n\n\"After 27 years of dedication and innovation, the Shoshanna collection has developed a legion of fans, including Mindy Kaling, Isla Fisher, Kelly Ripa, and The Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle. The collection can be found in luxury retailers like Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, Bloomingdale's, ShopBop, and Anthropologie as well as over 500 specialty stores in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia,\" the company shared on its website.\n\nShoshanah Fashions has not made a public statement about its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. The filing, however, came on the same day Saks Global filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nSaks Global's Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus are key distribution partners for Shoshanna Fashions, and the brand is almost certainly owed money by its partner, according to data shared with TheStreet by Ragini Bhalla, Head of Brand and Spokesperson for Creditsafe.\n\n\"Saks Inc. had a persistent and troubling pattern of paying vendors late in 2025,\npointing to sustained liquidity problems. Days Beyond Terms (DBT) refers to the\nnumber of days late (i.e., past payment terms) that a company pays its bills. One of the\nmost common indications that a company is struggling with cash flow is when its DBT is\nsignificantly higher than other companies in the same industry,\" the research showed.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — From toppling Venezuela's leader to ordering mass deportations, from turning once independent government entities into rubber stamps to demolishing the East Wing for a White House ballroom, President Donald Trump spent his first year back in office trampling political norms and testing institutional checks and balances.\n\nSome of his ideas that once seemed implausible, if not outright fanciful, are now reality. But there are other things that Trump could not deliver on.\n\n“I’ve kept all my promises and much more,” Trump insisted during a speech this week in Detroit.\n\nWith his administration nearing the one-year mark, here's a look at where some of his most jaw-dropping promises stand:\n\nIn progress: A new Qatari Air Force One\n\nU.S. defense officials in May accepted a luxury Boeing 747 jet from Qatar for Trump to eventually use as Air Force One, brushing aside ethical and legal questions and even anti-bribery constitutional provisions. The aircraft is being retrofitted in Texas to meet U.S. security and communications standards that are likely to cost about $400 million, the Air Force says. Outside experts estimate costs could approach $1 billion. Despite Trump's boasts that the work would be done in six months, completion may not actually occur until after he leaves office in January 2029.\n\nWhat's in progress: Annexing Greenland\n\nAfter the U.S. military's removal of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, Trump renewed his calls to take over the semiautonomous Danish territory, insisting the United States will “have” Greenland “one way or another.” The president also tapped Gov. Jeff Landry, R-La., as the special U.S. envoy to Greenland, with a nod to the 1803 Louisiana Purchase from France that doubled the size of the U.S. Denmark says it is not ceding the world's largest island and that any invasion could have geopolitical implications given that Denmark is a NATO ally.\n\nTrump has tried to denigrate his predecessor, Joe Biden, by accusing the Democrat of overreliance on the autopen to sign presidential pardons, legislation and other key documents, despite the fact that Trump and other presidents have also used the tool. In October, a GOP-controlled House committee released a report alleging misuse of the autopen by the Biden administration. Trump's Department of Justice is investigating.\n\nThe president has said he wants to reopen an “expanded and rebuilt” Alcatraz, the notorious San Francisco Bay prison that has been closed for six-plus decades, to house immigration detainees. William K. Marshall III, the director of the Bureau of Prisons, toured the island in July. His agency announced that engineers and planners were developing design concepts, preliminary budgets and logistical models.\n\nTrump has posted on social media about extending traditional home mortgages repayments from 30 years to 50 years, suggesting that this could ease concerns about housing affordability. Economists say the switch would make it harder to build wealth through home ownership. Nonetheless, the White House has pledged to push the change. Officials have made little headway since, however, and Trump instead has looked to reduce mortgage rates by having the federal government buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds.\n\nTrump has frequently toyed with the idea of a third term, despite the Constitution stating that no one can be elected president “more than twice.” He acknowledged in October, “I would say that if you read it, it’s pretty clear I’m not allowed to run. It’s too bad.” White House chief of staff Susie Wiles also told Vanity Fair that Trump “knows he can’t run again.” Still, Trump mused this month, “I’m not allowed to run? I’m not sure,” and suggested there could be “a constitutional movement” to make that happen.\n\nWhat's faded away: Making Canada the 51st state\n\nDespite it being far-fetched, Trump has talked about making America's northern neighbor the “Great State of Canada” since before his second term started. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney assured Trump during a subsequent White House visit that his country “won’t be for sale, ever.” Carney suggested in June that Trump had lost interest. Trump has continued to bring up the idea, though, including during a September speech to military personnel in Virginia.\n\nTrump suggested in February that billionaire Elon Musk would be checking out Fort Knox in Kentucky to ensure that U.S. gold reserves were still there. The president even floated the notion of tagging along. Nothing came of that, however, and Musk has left the administration.\n\nSending thousands of migrants to Guantanamo\n\nThe president pledged to ship up to 30,000 of the “worst criminal aliens” to a U.S. Navy lockup in Cuba, and between February and June, about 500 immigrants were held there. But those numbers have since declined and sometimes reached zero. Housing migrants at Guantanamo is more expensive than in traditional detention centers, and doing so has drawn legal challenges.\n\nGaza Strip as a Mediterranean Sea resort\n\nTrump repeatedly suggested that the U.S. would take over war-torn Gaza and move out the Palestinians living there, and that U.S. developers could turn the area into a “Riviera of the Middle East,” after the war between Israel and Hamas. Gaza's reconstruction is a key question amid a Trump administration-brokered ceasefire, but Arab nations have rejected the idea of it being a vacation spot. Trump no longer mentions it.\n\nThe president says his tariffs could raise enough revenue for most Americans to get $2,000 payments. But he also has pledged to spend that same money on plugging deficits created by tax cuts, reducing the national debt, keeping a key nutrition program for low-income mothers and children funded during last year's government shutdown, aiding farmers and adding to defense spending for 2027. The U.S. collected about $289 billion in tariff revenue last year, which would be well short of what rebate checks would cost, even without the other promised earmarks. Trump also promised that slashing the size of federal government would give Americans rebate checks, but those never materialized.\n\nEliminating the federal income tax\n\nTrump has frequently said that steep import tariffs “will be enough to cut all of the income tax,” long suggesting that the U.S. was better off during the Gilded Age, when there was no income tax and federal revenue came largely from tariffs. “If you go back to the 1800s, 1887,” he said Friday, “We had money, so much money, we didn’t know what to do with it.” Lately, however, his administration has more often been promoting how much his tax and spending law might reduce 2026 tax bills for many Americans.\n\nTrump hates the dynamic kickoff, calling it a “demeaning” and “unromantic” affront to football's “pageantry.” By November, Trump was suggesting the NFL didn't “have the right to do that to the game” while acknowledging, “I don’t think they’ll change.”\n\nWhat's been accomplished: Bringing back the War Department\n\nTrump signed an executive order in September aiming to rename the Department of Defense as the Department of War. It will take an act of Congress to make the change lawful.\n\nThe board of trustees of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, stocked with Trump loyalists, voted in December to add Trump's name to Washington's premier performing arts venue, memorializing the 35th president. The move drew show cancellations and a lawsuit. The Kennedy Center is named by statute and would need Congress' approval for a legal change.\n\nReducing Chinese influence on the Panama Canal\n\nTrump suggested before his second term that the U.S. might retake control of the Panama Canal because Panama had failed to check Chinese influence over the waterway. His administration then pressured China to have the Hong Kong-based operator of ports at both ends of the canal sell those interests to a U.S. consortium, though that process faced delays. Panama withdrew from China's Belt and Road investment program in Latin America, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited Panama in April and agreed to bolster security coordination.\n\nThe president announced in December that his long-promised “ gold card ” was going on sale. It offers legal status, and an eventual pathway to U.S. citizenship, for individuals paying $1 million and corporations ponying up twice that per foreign-born employee, plus an upfront $15,000 fee to cover screening costs. The program is meant to replace EB-5 visas, which offered permanent U.S. residency in exchange for foreign investors spending a bit more than $1 million on a business that creates at least 10 full-time jobs for American workers.\n\nSince tearing down the East Wing, construction crews have worked into the night, hustling to finish the massive ballroom before Trump's term ends. The president initially said the structure, set to be bigger than the White House itself, would cost $200 million but he now says $400 million. He has promised that it will be paid for by himself and private donors. The White House has released only a partial list of who is actually contributing and has argued that parts of the project's plans are “ top secret.”\n\nMore to watch: Possible US military action in Colombia, Mexico and Iran\n\nFollowing the U.S. operation in Venezuela, Trump accused Colombian President Gustavo Petro of “making cocaine and selling it to the United States” and said U.S intervention in that country “sounds good to me.” After a friendly call with Petro, however, Trump suggested that “the situation of drugs and other disagreements” had been defused. Trump, though, also maintains that Mexico is “run” by drug cartels and says, “You have to do something with Mexico.” He's warned Iran that if that country starts “killing people like they have in the past” during a recent round of sweeping, anti-government protests, then “they are going to get hit very hard by the United States.” Killings have run into the thousands, but by Friday, Trump appeared to be backing off those threats.\n\nCuba collapsing with or without US intervention\n\nTrump has repeatedly noted Cuba's weakened position since the U.S. captured Maduro, whose country was a major ally of the communist-run island. Trump has said Cuba “only survives because of Venezuela” and is “ready to fall” without the U.S. intervening. Venezuela's economic and social chaos and Maduro's ouster have raised questions about Cuba's future. But Trump has also suggested Cuba “make a deal, BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE,” without saying what that means.\n\nTrump says he wants a Golden Dome missile defense program — a multilayered, $175 billion system that would put U.S. weapons in space for the first time — to be fully operational by January 2029. Defense officials say more likely all that will be achieved by then is some initial capability for the system. It is envisioned to include ground- and space-based capabilities that can detect and stop missiles at various stages of attack.\n\nTrump said he talked to Rob Manfred before Major League Baseball's commissioner reinstated Cincinnati Reds slugger Pete Rose in May. Rose died in 2024 but still faced a baseball ban over betting on the game, despite having a record 4,256 career hits. Trump now wants Rose in the Hall of Fame, but that's up to the Hall’s Classic Baseball Committee, which likely will not meet until at least December 2027.\n\nThe fourth installment of the cop buddy-comedy series starring Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan will be coming out after a reported request from Trump. Paramount, which is co-owned by David Ellison, son of Oracle co-founder and Trump megadonor Larry Ellison, is set to distribute the film. Semafor reported that Trump had asked Ellison to help revive the franchise. Warner Bros. released the first three “Rush Hour” films, but eschewed the fourth after earlier sexual misconduct allegations against its director, Brett Ratner. Ratner also made a documentary on first lady Melania Trump.",

    "description": "In the 12 days since the U.S. seized Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, interim President Delcy Rodriguez has been working to consolidate her own power, installing loyalists in",
    "fullText": "Jan 17 (Reuters) - In the 12 days since the U.S. seized Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, interim President Delcy Rodriguez has been working to consolidate her own power, installing loyalists in key positions to protect herself from internal threats while meeting U.S. demands to boost oil production.\n\nRodriguez, 56, a quiet but rigorous technocrat who was vice president and oil minister, has named a central banker to help run the economy, a presidential chief of staff and, crucially, a new head of Venezuela’s feared DGCIM, the military counterintelligence agency ​built over decades with Cuban assistance.\n\nMajor General Gustavo Gonzalez, 65, will now head the agency, a move three sources with knowledge of the government described as an early gambit by Rodriguez to counter what many in Venezuela say is the biggest threat to her leadership: Diosdado ‌Cabello, Venezuela's hardline interior minister with close ties to the security services and the dreaded “colectivos” motorcycle gangs which have killed opposition supporters.\n\n\"She is very clear that she doesn't have the capacity to survive without the consent of the Americans,\" said one source close to the government. \"She's already reforming the armed forces, removing people and naming new officials.\"\n\nInterviews with seven sources in Venezuela, including diplomats, business ‌people and politicians, reveal in previously unreported detail the fault line at the heart of Venezuela's government and the risks it poses to Rodriguez as she tries to consolidate internal control while meeting Trump administration dictates on oil sales. The sources spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.\n\nThe tightrope Rodriguez is attempting to walk was evident in her first major speech since taking office. Addressing parliament in a national annual address on Thursday, she called for unity, stressed her bona fides as Maduro’s loyal deputy, and vowed to forge a new chapter in Venezuela’s politics with increased oil investment.\n\nVenezuela’s communications ministry, which handles all press inquiries for the government and individual officials, did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\n\nThe White House responded to emailed questions from Reuters by referring the news agency to recent comments made by Trump. In an interview with Reuters on Wednesday, Trump said Rodriguez \"has been very good to deal with\" and that he expected her to visit ⁠Washington at some point.\n\nRodriguez - nicknamed \"the tsarina\" for her business connections - has broad influence over the country's ‌civilian levers of power, including the crucial oil industry, and now also enjoys the backing of the United States. That backing appeared to be reemphasized on Thursday when Rodriguez met with CIA director John Ratcliffe in Caracas.\n\nThe other main faction is led by Cabello.\n\nCabello, who also heads the ruling PSUV socialist party, is a former soldier with a weekly four-hour show on state television, which has run for 12 years. His first public act after Maduro's capture was to appear on screen ‍dressed in a flak jacket and surrounded by armed guards as he led a chant of, \"To doubt is to betray.”\n\nOfficials in the Trump administration had contact with Cabello months before the operation to seize Maduro and have also been in communication with him since, four sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, warning him against using the security services or colectivos to target the opposition.\n\nCabello, who was jailed in Venezuela for backing eventual socialist President Hugo Chavez in a failed 1992 coup, is under indictment in the U.S. and has a $25 million reward for his capture.\n\nSo far Cabello has been conciliatory towards Rodriguez, saying they are “very united” and he arrived at Thursday's national address alongside Rodriguez and her ​brother Jorge, the head of the national assembly. But sources with knowledge of their relationship told Reuters that Cabello remains the biggest threat to her ability to govern.\n\nIn Caracas, security forces are skittish. A few hours after Rodriguez was sworn in, there was a brief burst of anti-aircraft fire outside ‌the presidential palace that some feared could be another U.S. attack. Instead, reports suggest it was a miscommunication between police and the presidential guard, which shot down police drones. The government said the craft were spy drones, without explaining who they belonged to.\n\nAcross the country, people are reeling from the shock of Maduro’s capture and unsure whether to be hopeful or scared. In some places, local socialist party branches have asked members to spy on their neighbors and report anyone celebrating Maduro’s downfall, according to three party members who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nIn this tense environment, Rodriguez must persuade party loyalists that she is not a U.S. puppet who betrayed Maduro. She must also stabilize an economy that saw prices for basic goods soar in the days since the U.S. attack, as well as wrestle some degree of control over the sprawling military-linked patronage networks that have developed over decades of Chavismo rule.\n\nVenezuela has as many as 2,000 generals and admirals, more than double the number in the United States, a military superpower with 20 times more active duty and reserve troops. Senior and retired officers control food distribution, raw materials and the state oil company PDVSA, while dozens of generals sit on the boards of private firms.\n\nMany officials are able to run ⁠their regional fiefdoms as they see fit - ordering patrols or checkpoints by soldiers under their command - and some parts of the country and capital Caracas have seen increased activity ​by security services since Maduro's capture.\n\nREPRESSION ‘ALREADY HAS A NAME’\n\nGonzalez, the new head of the military counterintelligence agency DGCIM, has over his long career in Venezuela’s government worked closely with Cabello, particularly during ​two stints as head of the separate civilian spy agency.\n\nYet it is to Rodriguez that Gonzalez owes his most recent posts. In 2024, Rodriguez tapped Gonzalez for a top job at the state oil company, Venezuela’s most important company and the engine of the country’s economy.\n\nQuestions still remain over how much control Gonzalez will be able to exert over DGCIM. Cabello's allies within the agency could undermine him, the three sources with knowledge of the government said.\n\nOne source with knowledge of the inner workings ‍of the security services said Gonzalez's DGCIM predecessor General Javier Marcano struggled to control ⁠the agency.\n\n\"The role of boss of repression already has a name… Diosdado,\" this person said. \"Marcano was coordinating with (civilian) militias and with the colectivos, but he had serious difficulties controlling DGCIM because his designation was nominal.\"\n\nThe colectivos, closely connected to Cabello, could also make the country ungovernable by implementing a so-called \"anarchization\" strategy, which was first designed to fend off U.S. intervention but could be directed ⁠against Rodriguez, the source close to the government told Reuters. That strategy would mobilize the intelligence services and colectivos to plunge Caracas into disorder and chaos.\n\nCabello could also slow the pace of prisoner releases that have been hailed by Trump. They have been proceeding much more slowly than demanded by families and rights groups, creating a potential pressure point for Rodriguez.\n\nOutside of Venezuela, ‌however, pressure on Cabello continues to mount.\n\n\"For the Trump administration to achieve a real transition in Venezuela, sooner or later Diosdado Cabello must face U.S. justice,\" U.S. Representative Maria Elvira Salazar said on X this month. \"When Diosdado is brought to justice, it will be ‌a decisive step toward a democratic transition in Venezuela and the release of all political hostages.\"",

    "fullText": "Cleveland Metroparks marked a wildlife milestone that had conservationists and scientists buzzing: trail cameras recorded a fisher, a medium-sized mammal in the weasel family — and this was verified as the first sighting of the species in Cuyahoga County in more than 100 years, Fox 8 reported.\n\n\"This is tremendously exciting,\" reads the caption from Cleveland Metroparks' Instagram post, which reflects on the significance of the sighting for both the region's natural history and ongoing conservation efforts.\n\nFishers disappeared from this part of Ohio in the mid-1800s, mainly due to trapping and habitat loss, the post detailed. Their return signals the success of long-term restoration and smart management of local environments.\n\nTrail cameras, like the ones used in the Cleveland area, are convenient and powerful tools that help wildlife experts monitor population health, track movements, and gather evidence of rehabilitation and species recovery.\n\nEach captured image contributes to a broader understanding of how native species are reestablishing themselves. They give communities insight into the health of their local ecosystems.\n\nThe role of trail cameras in conservation is significant. Recently, trail cameras captured unique footage of a grizzly bear in the Yukon and a leopard in West Coast National Park in South Africa.\n\nThe resurgence of species like the fisher carries benefits that ripple beyond the woods.\n\nHealthy wildlife populations help support balanced ecosystems, which humans also rely on for food, water, and clean air. Communities can take pride in conservation victories, seeing firsthand that their efforts pay off and that people can positively impact their surroundings.\n\nThe return of a species after a century shows that thoughtful environmental management can foster biodiversity, helping ecosystems thrive alongside human development.\n\nFor Cleveland Metroparks and the Ohio Division of Wildlife, the fisher's appearance is a reminder that conservation works.\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nTrail cameras won't just document these rare moments; they will also help guide continued efforts to protect species and habitats, proving that even a century-old absence can have a hopeful comeback story.\n\n\"Phenomenal,\" said one local resident when learning of the fisher's reappearance.\n\nAnother said: \"This is huge!!!

At the time, Agnel admitted the incidents occurred, but denied that any coercion took place.\n\nThat year, France passed a law that defined sex with a child under the age of 15 — France's age of consent — as rape. It is now punishable by up to 20 years in jail.\n\nIn July 2024, Agnel, who retired from swimming in 2016, attended a meeting with the victim, who is now in her early 20s, that he had requested, per Le Monde.\n\nWant to keep up with the latest crime coverage? \n\nAgnel won gold in the 200m freestyle and the 4x100m freestyle relay at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. He qualified for the 2016 Games in Rio, but failed to get through the heats that year. He announced his retirement from the sport soon after.\n\nIf you or someone you know has been sexually assaulted, please contact the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-656-HOPE (4673) or go to rainn.org.",

    "fullText": "The US isn't the tourist destination it once was.\n\nVisits to the US by international travelers declined for the eighth straight month in December, according to data released earlier this month by the National Travel and Tourism Office.\n\nIn 2025, visits to the US were down among 10 of the top 20 overseas tourist-generating countries, including India, Germany, and South Korea.\n\nThe decline is a sustained blow to the travel and tourism industries, which in 2024 supported more than 15 million jobs, and generated about $1.3 trillion in economic output — including $181 billion from inbound international travel.\n\nMajor tourism hubs like Las Vegas are seeing widespread layoffs due to the downturn, forcing workers to get creative with their career pivots. Business Insider reported earlier this month that laid-off hospitality workers contributed to a 55% increase in dancer auditions at a Las Vegas strip club compared to the prior six months.\n\nIt doesn't appear the travel bug has gone anywhere — just that international tourists are avoiding the US.\n\nIn Australia, for example, overseas arrivals and departures data released Friday by the country's Bureau of Statistics shows that international travel returned to pre-pandemic levels just before the lockdowns began in 2020. Australians travelling to Canada rose 4% in the last year, 10% more visited India, and visits by Australians to China and Japan rose 20% and 21%, respectively, but 3.2% fewer booked a trip to the US.\n\nFewer Canadian travelers are visiting the US, as well, opting instead to go further south to Mexico, Business Insider reported last April.\n\nComplicating demand were ongoing trade frictions, tariff battles, and geopolitical unease, which helped fuel grass-roots boycotts of US goods and, in some cases, changes in travel plans.\n\nEuropean travel firms and analysts pointed to tariff-driven consumer backlash and growing anti-American sentiment as factors that contributed to early-year softness in bookings, even as demand showed signs of rebounding later in the summer.\n\nDomestic travel has helped cushion the blow so far, with the US Travel Association projecting that domestic leisure travel was forecast to grow 1.9% to $895 billion in 2025.\n\nHowever, if international visitors continue to stay away, destinations that depend on overseas spending — from iconic tourism cities to national parks — could feel growing pressure as the US heads into a high-stakes stretch of global events in 2026 and beyond.",

    "description": "Actor Matt Damon said Netflix wants action movies to reiterate plot lines multiple times because people are on their phones while watching a movie.",
    "fullText": "Netflix wants to change the way action movies are made amid the never-ending battle for our sustained attention, according to \"Bourne\" actor Matt Damon.\n\nIn an interview on the \"Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast, Damon and longtime collaborator and friend Ben Affleck spoke about their latest experience costarring in and coproducing their first Netflix-exclusive heist film, \"The Rip,\" which was released Friday. The two actors talked about how streaming and short-form video platforms have upended the way movies are consumed, made, and sold to audiences.\n\nDamon said Netflix is now asking for action films to have bigger sequences occur within the first five minutes of the movie and suggesting that actors reiterate the plot line to cater to viewers who are on their phones.\n\nThe actor said the \"standard way\" he learned to make an action film was to have the finale — \"the big one with all the explosions\" that a production spends most of its money on — occur in the third act.\n\n\"Now, they're like, 'Can we get a big one in the first five minutes? We want people to stay tuned in. And you know it wouldn't be terrible if you reiterated the plot three or four times in the dialogue because people are on their phones while they're watching,'\" he said. \"And so then it's going to really start to infringe on how we're telling a story.\"\n\nDamon didn't specify if Netflix gave the instruction to the actor and producer for his latest heist movie.\n\nA Netflix spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment sent during the weekend.\n\nAffleck added that the suggestions aren't reflected in every new action film or series coming out on Netflix. The actor pointed to \"Adolescence,\" a crime miniseries that has episodes shot in one continuous take. The show was released in March.\n\nDamon said he felt the show was an exception.\n\n\"My feeling is just that it demonstrates that you don't need to do any of that\" stuff, Affleck said.\n\nHe later added, \"It's like supply and demand. People want to look at their phones, they look at TikTok, they're going to do that. I think what you can do is make shit the best you can. Make it really good.\"",

    "description": "Griffin Canning pitched for the New York Mets in 2025.",
    "fullText": "According to a new report from Jon Heyman of the New York Post, the St. Louis Cardinals are interested in rehabbing free agent starting pitcher Griffin Canning, who spent the 2025 campaign with the New York Mets.\n\nThe Mets have shown interest in bringing back Griffin Canning, who should be ready around Opening Day after suffering an Achilles tear last year. The Cardinals and White Sox also are interested.\n\nNow 29 years old, Canning is a six-year veteran of the Los Angeles Angels and Mets. He's gone 32-37 in his career with a 4.65 ERA. He had a career-high seven wins in 2023, and again in 2025 before getting hurt. He was 7-3 with a 3.77 ERA in 16 starts for the Mets. He hasn't traditionally struck out a lot of batters, but he had 70 Ks in 76.1 innings a season ago, signaling that perhaps he's unlocked more swing-and-miss stuff.\n\nThe Cardinals could be interested in a veteran innings-eater to help keep the pressure off young prospects like Quinn Matthews and Liam Doyle. Even though it's unclear exactly when he'd be able to return to a big-league rotation, he should be able to provide good cover for those prospects. The Cardinals may be able to trade him for a prospect at the trade deadline, or perhaps they could ink him to a multi-year deal, allowing him to rehab and work through things in 2026, while flipping him at some point in 2027.\n\nThe Cardinals are rebuilding, but they should be able to provide Canning with opportunities to rebuild his value. If he's looking for a promised rotation spot and an opportunity to impress people ahead of 2027, he could take a one-year deal in St. Louis. He could also end up being dealt to a contender at the deadline, giving him a chance to win a World Series.\n\nMatthew Liberatore, Dustin May and Andre Pallante are assured rotation spots, with Richard Fitts and Hunter Dobbins likely serving as options once they are recovered from their 2025 injuries. Beyond them, Doyle and Matthews are waiting.\n\nThe one that could impact Canning negatively? Perhaps there's too many variables, too many prospects and too many possibilities in the rotation as is. Maybe the rotation spot isn't guaranteed all year, which could scare him to an organization with more security.\n\nRemember to join our CARDINALS on ROUNDTABLE community, which is FREE!

    "fullText": "New Jersey Devils forward Jesper Bratt is set to play his 600th NHL game tonight as the Devils take on the Hurricanes.\n\nBratt made his NHL debut against the Hurricanes in October 2017. Ahead of his milestone game, Bratt shared his thoughts with NJD.tv.\n\n“It’s really special. Time goes fast,” Bratt said. “Super honored and happy to be doing it here in the same place and in front of the same fans I did my first game. It’s going to be a special time.”\n\nIn 599 NHL games, Bratt has scored 161 goals and 322 assists. Over his nine seasons with the Devils, Bratt has become a key contributor.\n\nReflecting on Bratt’s journey since being drafted in the sixth round (162nd pick), head coach Sheldon Keefe offered his perspective on the forward’s career.\n\n\"When I've been asked about him and reflect on him and what I observe is a guy that works extremely hard, is extremely focused and disciplined,\" Keefe said. \"How he prepares, how he seeks to improve, how he accepts coaching and information. In that sense, he's an easy guy to coach because he's all about getting better and all about helping the team.\"\n\nThis season, Bratt has appeared in 47 games, earning 36 points (11 G, 25 A). Keefe continued to highlight the left winger’s accomplishments.\n\n“From where he was drafted to how quickly he got into the league to how he found ways to be successful despite being an undersized guy to being a premier player in the league,\" Keefe said. \"Quite a story, great accomplishment for him. I feel like he's just getting started.\"\n\nThe puck will drop at 7 PM tonight.\n\nake sure you bookmark THN's New Jersey Devils site for THN's latest news, exclusive interviews, breakdowns, and so much more.\n\nFor action-packed issues, access to the entire magazine archive and a free issue, com/free. Get the latest news and trending stories by subscribing to our newsletter here. And share your thoughts by commenting below the article on THN.com or creating your own post in our community forum.",

    "fullText": "NFL playoffs overtime rules, explained: How tie games are decided compared to regular season, preseason originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nCan an NFL playoff game end in a tie?\n\nNFL overtime rules for playoff games\n\nNFL overtime rules for regular season\n\nNFL overtime rules for preseason\n\nHistory of NFL playoff overtime rules\n\nPlayoff football tends to be neck-and-neck. Sometimes, it even requires some extra time.\n\nWhile no games in last year's NFL playoffs required overtime, it wasn't too long ago that the Super Bowl went an extra frame, when the Kansas City Chiefs took down the San Francisco 49ers to go back-to-back in February 2024 on a game-winning touchdown pass in overtime.\n\nGiven the nature of the postseason, NFL overtime rules are a bit different in the playoffs vs. the regular season. Most notably, the playoff rules prioritize giving both teams a chance to win, something that changed in recent years.\n\nHere's everything to know about how the 2026 NFL playoff overtime rules work, and how they compare to the regular season and preseason.\n\nMORE: Everything to know about the NFL's virtual measurement system\n\nNo, an NFL playoff game cannot end in a tie. In the preseason and regular season, games can end in ties. However, with the league needing a team to move on to the next round of the playoffs, there is no possibility of a tie in the postseason.\n\nTeams will play more overtime periods until a tie is broken in the playoffs.\n\nMORE: How does NFL MVP voting work?\n\nThe NFL's newest overtime rules for playoff games were implemented in the 2023 postseason. The biggest change was largely in response to the 2022 AFC Championship Game between the Chiefs and Bills, guaranteeing that both teams would get a possession in overtime.\n\nHere's how OT works for playoff games via the NFL rulebook:\n\nIf the score is still tied at the end of an overtime period — or if the second team’s initial possession has not ended — the teams will play another overtime period. There can be no ties in the playoffs. Play will continue regardless of how many overtime periods are needed for a winner to be determined.\n\nThere will be a two-minute intermission between each overtime period. There will not be a halftime intermission after the second period.\n\nThe captain who lost the first overtime coin toss will either choose to possess the ball or select which goal his team will defend, unless the team that won the coin toss deferred that choice.\n\nEach team will have an opportunity to possess the ball in overtime.\n\nEach team gets three timeouts during a half.\n\nThe same timing rules that apply at the end of the second and fourth regulation periods also apply at the end of a second or fourth overtime period.\n\nIf there is still no winner at the end of a fourth overtime period, there will be another coin toss, and play will continue until a winner is declared.\n\nRegardless of whether the team who receives the opening overtime kickoff scores a touchdown, the other team is guaranteed a possession.  However, the game is over if a safety or defensive touchdown is scored.\n\nIf the game is tied after both teams possess the ball once, then the next score wins.\n\nMORE: Explaining how the NCAA OT format works and differences from NFL\n\nIn comparison to the postseason, overtime in the NFL regular season is a bit different, mostly because games can end in ties.\n\nHere are the official regular season overtime rules, via the NFL rulebook:\n\nAt the end of regulation, the referee will toss a coin to determine which team will possess the ball first in overtime. The visiting team captain will call the toss.\n\nNo more than one 10-minute period will follow a three-minute intermission. Each team must possess, or have the opportunity to possess, the ball, rather than one team being able to win the game by scoring on its first overtime possession. The exception is if the team kicking off to start the overtime period scores a safety on the receiving team’s initial possession, then the team that kicked off is the winner.\n\nSudden death play — where the game ends on any score (safety, field goal or touchdown) — continues until a winner is determined after each team has had an opportunity to possess the ball.\n\nThe point after try is not attempted if the game ends on a touchdown.\n\nIf the score is still tied at the end of the overtime period, the result of the game will be recorded as a tie.\n\nThere are no instant replay coach’s challenges; all reviews will be initiated by the replay official.\n\nMORE:Breaking down the NFL's newest kickoff rules\n\nThe most straightforward NFL overtime rules come in the preseason: there is no overtime. With. games not counting for much in the preseason, the league doesn't bother to try and break ties.\n\nThat change was made in 2021, prioritizing player health and safety in games that do not have any bearing on the standings. Players can be evaluated from the first through fourth quarters, and no extra periods are necessary.\n\nMORE: Why does the NFL allow ties in the regular season?\n\nA lot has changed since the first NFL game to go to overtime on Aug. 28, 1955, between the Rams and Giants. That game was played under “sudden death” rules, and the Rams won. From there, the overtime format was fully introduced.\n\nThe NFL moved forward with that model before implementing sudden-death overtime for regular-season games 16 years later. In the original format, the first team to score any points at all won the game. That included kicking a game-winning field goal. “Sudden death” remained the format for 35 years.\n\nIn 2010, the playoff overtime rules were tweaked. For teams that received the ball first, a field goal no longer counted as a game-ender in “sudden death.” Under the change, only a touchdown on the first possession of overtime could win the game in the playoffs. Otherwise, the other team would get a possession.\n\nThat format was added to the preseason and regular season in 2012.\n\nThe length of overtime was altered in 2017, decreasing from a full 15 minutes to just 10 minutes.\n\nIn 2021, overtime was removed from preseason games, with the NFL citing player safety to avoid unnecessary periods.\n\nMost recently, the NFL changed the playoff overtime rules in 2022, assuring both teams would get at least one possession in overtime of a postseason game. Regardless of whether the first team scored a touchdown, the other team was given a shot to tie the game or come back to win it. If the score remained tied after each team had a possession, then “sudden death” began.\n\nMORE: What is considered a catch in the NFL?\n\nHere are the six longest NFL games ever, all of which went deep into overtime. Because regular season games can end in ties, the longest overtime games all consist of playoff games.\n\nAll six of the games below required two overtime periods to decide a winner.\n\nAFC Divisional Round (Dolphins vs. Chiefs)\n\nAFL Championship (Texans vs. Oilers)\n\nAFC Divisional Round (Browns vs. Jets)\n\nAFC Divisional Round (Ravens vs. Broncos)\n\nAFC Divisional Round (Raiders vs. Colts)\n\nNFC Divisional Round (Panthers vs. Rams)\n\nMORE:What is Scorigami in the NFL?",

    "description": "Philadelphia Phillies hitting coach believes Bryce Harper could be better in a key area.",
    "fullText": "The big narrative surrounding Bryce Harper this offseason is whether or not the eight-time All-Star and two-time MVP is still an “elite” player. A debate that Philadelphia Phillies president Dave Dombrowski sparked with a comment during a media availability earlier this winter.\n\nWhether Harper is an elite player is subjective, but there is one area he could improve upon heading into the 2026 season, which Kevin Long recently detailed during an appearance on MLB Network Radio.\n\nThe Phillies' hitting coach detailed how Harper must improve his strike-zone awareness and plate discipline.\n\n“Bryce needs to make sure his strike zone is better than it was last year. I mean, going there this year,\" Long said. \"He sees the least amount of strikes in all of baseball. If that's the case, then we gotta be a little more disciplined in our own. So there's always something.\"\n\nIt’s important to note that Long by no means was calling out Harper or singling the slugger out. The coach was talking about how everyone on the roster has areas for improvement.\n\nThat said, Harper having better plate discipline is a fair criticism and area of improvement ot focus on. Harper has always been a free-swinging type player, but his discipline during the 2025 season wasn’t great.\n\nHarper had a chase-rate of 35.6 percent and a whiff-rate of 30.7 percent, both of which were among his career-highs in those categories. Still, the slugger managed to slash .261/.357/.487 with an OPS of .844, including 27 home runs and 32 doubles.\n\nEven with the high whiff and chase rate, Harper was still a productive hitter. Now, just imagine what he could get back to if Harper can make some of the adjustments Long is proposing.\n\nWhen talking about Harper and the rest of the Phillies roster, Long continued, “there are things these guys can do and work on. That sometimes it's my idea, sometimes it's theirs, but we'll attack those areas and try to get better.”\n\nIf Harper can make some of these small adjustments and be a little more selective with what he’s swinging at, he could, in return, be more productive and impactful at the plate.",

    "description": "The Bruins were outclassed physically by the Buckeyes.",
    "fullText": "COLUMBUS, Ohio - UCLA head coach Mick Cronin was disgusted with his team's lack of defense on Saturday.\n\nThe Bruins (12-6, 4-3) fell to the Ohio State Buckeyes (12-5, 4-3) 86-74 and a premier offensive day from the Bruins, led by a 30 point performance Tyler Bilodeau, meant nothing in the face of the way they were outclassed on the defensive end and bullied physically throughout the game.\n\n\"We wasted a great shot-making day from him [Bilodeau] with awful defense,\" Cronin said (via UCLA Athletics).\n\nCronin didn't mince words after the game. At this point, Cronin doesn't even feel that he can put winning basketball with the team that he has. Cronin shouldered the blame for the loss, not because of any specific failure of coaching, but because he was the one that recruited and signed the players that he now feels are inept at defending strong opponents and lack the willingness to put themselves on the line physically.\n\n\"Our defense is an embarrassment today. Last couple games it was great. Today, we couldn't guard them... We had nobody interested in rising to the challenge defensively. Everybody wants somebody else to get the dirty work. We're a team that struggles to have dirty work guys,\" Cronin said.\n\nEffort is something that Cronin takes very seriously. Throughout the season, especially after bad games, Cronin has lambasted his team for an unwillingness to make hard plays, whether that's been on the rebounding front or in guarding the other team.\n\nThe Bruins have shown flashes of defensive effort at times, but never enough to chain together a consistent streak of wins. UCLA was riding a two-game win streak going into Saturday's game, which was a brief reprieve from the struggles they'd had in the previous two games, but their flaws reared their ugly heads again.\n\nThe Bruins were especially outclassed when it came to rebounding, a major point of contention for Cronin. The Buckeyes out-rebounded the Bruins 37-27 and had 12 more defenisve rebounds in particular. It was a hard shooting day for UCLA overall, but they kept up with Ohio State in most other stats beyond rebounding, which became the difference maker as any extra chances UCLA might have had were stripped away again and again by their inability to keep the ball away from the Buckeyes in the glass.\n\nThe biggest failure of the Bruins in Saturday's game was by far their handling of the Buckeyes' star guards senior Bruce Thornton or sophomore John Mobley Jr. Cronin said that UCLA had plenty of time to prep for those two in particular, but no one in blue could keep up, or even tried to.\n\nMobley Jr. led the Buckeyes with 28 points while Thornton turned in a 21 point, eight rebound performance.\n\n\"Two really tough guards and we knew that coming into the game. We've just to be more ready to play and step up to the fight,\" Bilodeau said.",

    "fullText": "Mavericks guard Klay Thompson saw Utah Jazz forward Ace Bailey crowding him on the perimeter and decided to teach the rookie a lesson.\n\nWith Bailey face-guarding him, the future Hall of Famer simply rose up and shot over the rookie for one of his six first-half 3-pointers. Moments later, with second-year forward Cody Williams — the younger brother of NBA champion Jalen Williams — closing hard, Thompson again elevated and drilled another shot over the contest.\n\nThompson caught fire early, scoring all 23 of his points in the first half.\n\nAlong the way, he moved into fourth place on the NBA’s all-time list for made 3-pointers, passing Damian Lillard during Saturday’s game against the Jazz. Only James Harden, Ray Allen and Stephen Curry now sit ahead of him.\n\nThompson continued his historic pace by knocking down a turnaround jumper at the 4:56 mark of the first quarter to reach 17,000 career points. He became the 109th player in NBA history to reach the milestone.\n\nThompson’s big night helped the Mavericks beat the Jazz 138-120 at the American Airlines Center on Saturday evening.\n\nThe game marked the fourth and final regular-season meeting between the teams.

    "description": "The 49ers will be without tight end George Kittle in the divisional round of the playoffs. Here's the latest Kittle injury update:",
    "fullText": "As the San Francisco 49ers and Seattle Seahawks begin their NFL playoffs clash in the divisional round, one star player is conspicuously absent.\n\nWhat happened to George Kittle? And when could the 49ers' tight end return?\n\nIn last week's wild-card round game against the Philadelphia Eagles, Kittle tore his right Achilles tendon after catching a pass in the second quarter. The 49ers tight end had to be carted back to the locker room and was quickly ruled out of the remainder of the game with an Achilles injury. Head coach Kyle Shanahan confirmed to reporters after the game that Kittle had torn his Achilles.\n\nNFL NEWS, TAKES, FANTASY ADVICE: USA TODAY Sports has you covered with our NFL vodcast\n\nSan Francisco officially placed Kittle on injured reserve on Jan. 13. The 49ers' star tight end was scheduled to undergo surgery to repair the torn tendon on Jan. 14, according to Shanahan.\n\nHere's what to know about Kittle's status moving forward:\n\n49ERS AT SEAHAWKS: Predictions, picks, odds for NFL Divisional Round\n\nKittle's season is officially over after the 49ers placed their lead tight end on injured reserve. He will have to wait until next season for his return.\n\n\"Football sucks sometimes,\" Kittle wrote in an Instagram post. \"But I love it. I love these guys and this team. Heartbroken but have felt so much love and support from everyone reaching out. I’ll be good. Thank you. We aren’t done yet! Also when your team owner is the first person to meet you in the locker room, you know you’re in a special place. Cheers, all my love.\"\n\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, the rehab process following a surgery to repair a ruptured Achilles can last anywhere from four to six months before most patients \"return to their former level of activity.\" However, \"some problems can persist for up to a year\" without more exercises to rebuild strength and stability.\n\nHow long Kittle remains out will depend on the severity of his Achilles rupture and the length of his rehab process. The timeline for his return may become clearer once Kittle is out of surgery and has started his rehab.\n\nGEORGE KITTLE INJURY: Is it the 'last straw' for 49ers? Why one star foresees opposite effect\n\nKittle played in just 11 games this season in another year tainted by injuries. A Grade 3 hamstring tear kept him out of five games early in the season, and an ankle sprain later in the season caused Kittle to miss another game.\n\nHere's Kittle's numbers from a 2025 season that featured fewer games played for the tight end than any season since 2020:\n\nDespite the relative lack of playing time in 2025, Kittle's seven touchdowns were the third-highest total of his career behind 11 (2022) and eight (2024). The 49ers' tight end also earned a fifth straight Pro Bowl nod in 2025 and seventh in the last eight years.\n\nGeorge Kittle (season-ending IR – Achilles)\n\nTonges, who had his first career reception with a touchdown in Week 1 this year, is a fourth-year tight end who has taken on the primary tight end role in Kittle's absences this year. His 46 targets during the regular season were the most of any 49ers pass-catchers outside of Kittle, running back Christian McCaffrey and San Francisco's three leading wide receivers.\n\nFarrell joined the 49ers as a free agent last offseason after four years in Jacksonville and recorded his first career receiving touchdown in Week 2. Willis was on the 49ers' practice squad for most of the season and re-signed to the team's active roster after Kittle's Achilles injury.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: George Kittle injury update: When will 49ers TE return?",

    "fullText": "The San Jose Sharks have been a nice surprise this season. At the time of this writing, they have a 24-20-3 record and have the second wild card spot in the Western Conference.\n\nWith the Sharks being right in the playoff race, it would be understandable if they considered adding to their roster by the deadline. This is especially so if a potential target would benefit them beyond this season.\n\nWhen looking at trade candidates around the NHL, one player who could make sense for the Sharks to take a chance on is Edmonton Oilers forward Andrew Mangiapane.\n\nThere is a real expectation that the Oilers will end up trading Mangiapane this season. The 29-year-old forward has struggled to find his fit in Edmonton, and he is reportedly willing to waive his no-movement clause for the right team.\n\nMangiapane has struggled this season, as evidenced by his five goals and 11 points in 42 games. Yet, when looking at his past success, there is reason to believe that he could bounce back in the right situation. From 2021-22 to 2023-24 with the Calgary Flames, Mangiapane recorded at least 40 points in each campaign. With this, he could be an intriguing player for the Sharks to buy low on.\n\nIf Mangiapane bounced back, he would have the potential to be a nice pickup for the Sharks' top nine and would also give them another option for their power play. He also has a $3.6 million cap hit until next season, so he would be more than a rental.",

    "fullText": "Atletico Madrid will be busy between now and the closing of the winter transfer window, as they seek reinforcements for Diego Simeone’s squad. The departures of Javi Galan, Conor Gallagher and Giacomo Raspadori mean that a new left, central midfielder and forward are needed, and currently, work is being done on each area.\n\nMidfield is the priority for the time being, but addressing defence and attack is equally important. For the latter, targets have already been identified, with the favourite having also been picked out.\n\nAs per Diario AS, Atleti are very keen on signing Lee Kang-in, and talks between the two clubs are already ongoing. Director of Football Mateu Alemany has been in Paris in recent days, and he took in Paris Saint-Germain’s 3-0 victory over Lille on Friday, a match that the South Korea international was not involved in.\n\nLee is currently sidelined with a minor injury, but he will be back in action before the end of the month. Atleti do not see his current absence as a stumbling block, which is they have made their move, and with good relations between themselves and PSG, it is hoped that an agreement can be reached in the coming days.\n\nPSG are counting on Lee, so it is far from certain that PSG will allow a deal to be done. If that is the case, Atleti are prepared to move for another Ligue 1 attack: Matias Fernandez-Pardo. As per Diario AS, Los Colchoneros have rekindled the interest they showed in the summer, with the feeling now being that a deal is much more achievable.\n\nIt will be interesting to see who Atleti end up with, but both players would be exciting additions to Simeone’s squad – certainly more so than Raspadori was in the summer.",

    "fullText": "It had been a couple quiet games offensively for Nat Martinez, so in the biggest matchup of the conference season thus far she and Naomi Panganiban roared to life in the San Diego State women’s basketball team’s 75-66 overtime win over the UNLV Lady Rebels on Saturday afternoon at Cox Pavilion.\n\nMartinez scored a season-high 19 points, with 17 coming after halftime, and Panganiban had a game-high 20 points on 7-for-11 shooting as the Aztecs (14-3, 8-0 Mountain West) took just the second-ever meeting of teams with 7-0 conference records in Mountain West history to take first place.\n\nSDSU allowed just one made basket by the Lady Rebels (12-6, 7-1) in overtime, forcing five turnovers and holding UNLV to just 1-for-5 shooting from the field, while punishing the hosts by feeding the ball inside. Bailey Barnhard scored all 6 of her points in overtime, while Martinez got open back-door to give the Aztecs a two-possession lead midway through the extra session.\n\nThe Aztecs came out of halftime hitting almost everything from beyond the arc, as Martinez opened the third quarter by nailing back to back triples. UNLV responded with an 8-0 run that put the hosts back in front, but Panganiban kept the offense rolling by starting SDSU’s biggest scoring run of regulation.\n\nFirst she canned a 3-pointer, then Martinez got free for a driving layup as Alyssa Jackson and Panganiban made back-to-back 3’s as part of an 11-0 run and 17-8 push to start the second half. The lead grew as large as 10 points twice in the fourth quarter on a Martinez driving score and a Panganiban jumper.\n\nBut UNLV, who have won the last four regular season Mountain West titles, put together a 10-0 run over a 1:42 stretch to retake the lead with 41 seconds remaining. Mariah Elohim made two of her three 3-pointers for the game during the stretch, with Lady Rebels leading scorer kicking the run off with her 16th of 18 points of the night on a transition layup.\n\nPanganiban nailed a triple with 41 seconds left to put SDSU back in front by 1, but the Aztecs fouled Jasmyn Lott on a fast break with 18 seconds remaining, but the guard split the pair at the free-throw line. SDSU had a chance to win the game in regulation when Kennedy Lee was fouled on a put back attempt after Nala Williams’ driving attempt missed.\n\nThe win extended the Aztecs streak to 10 in a row, and was the first win in a true road game at UNLV since the 2012-13 season. San Diego State is 5-0 on the road this season and are 15-4 on the road since the beginning of last year.\n\nUp next will have a bye during the midweek round of Mountain West games, returning to action against the San José State Spartans on Saturday, Jan. 24. Tip-off is scheduled for 1 p.m. and the game will be streamed on the Mountain West Network.",

    "fullText": "All signs are Sam Darnold will start the Seahawks’ first playoff game.\n\nQuestionable to play because of an oblique injury he felt in practice Thursday, the Pro Bowl quarterback was on the field throwing as usual in full pads for pregame warmups about 45 minutes before the Seahawks hosted the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC divisional playoffs at Lumen Field Saturday night.\n\nDarnold threw a couple initial passes. He then windmilled his arms to loosen up before resuming his normal pregame routine. Darnold increased his throws to 25 yards, not throwing particularly hard and more lofting his passes.\n\nWhen the team went to 11 on 11 drills, Darnold was running the starting offense, as usual. He threw passes to Jason Smith-Njigba and other starters. He wasn’t throwing all that hard, because he didn’t have to yet, still a half hour before kickoff.\n\nDarnold had not been on the field during early pregame warmups about an hour earlier. Drew Lock threw to Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Cooper Kupp, AJ Barner and Seattle’s starting receivers. Rookie Jalen Milroe threw to reserves.\n\nThen the team issued their inactive players 90 minutes before kickoff, per NFL rules. Darnold was active to play. Milroe was inactive and the emergency third quarterback, as usual.\n\nDarnold and Lock being the team’s active quarterbacks was a sign the Seahawks were either waiting closer to kickoff to test Darnold’s oblique injury which had him questionable to play, or that he’d already tested it and they’d made their determination. “It’s just something he’s never experienced before,” Seahawks general manager John Schneider said on the team’s radio pregame show.\n\n“I think it’s just more precautionary stuff going on.\n\n“Luckily our medical staff (experienced) with it. And we move on.”",

    "description": "Sumayah Sugapong and Achol Magot had big games for the Wildcats",
    "fullText": "As the Arizona women’s basketball team prepared to go on the road and face No. 10 TCU, head coach Becky Burke said that the Wildcats weren’t going to Fort Worth with the idea that they were already beaten. That was despite losing leading scorer Micky Perdue just over a week ago.\n\n“What an opportunity for some other people to step up, what an opportunity for us to go get a couple wins…when there’s not one person outside this building that thinks that’s gonna happen,” Burke said on Wednesday.\n\nThe Wildcats showed that mindset from the jump, forcing TCU into 8 turnovers in the first quarter and turning those into 9 points. They didn’t back down, and after 20 minutes they were up 30-28 and had become the first opponent to lead at the half in Schollmaier Arena since Feb. 23, 2024. TCU picked it up over the final 15 minutes of the game to survive with a 78-62 victory.\n\n“We can go…and say we threw some punches because we gave it our all,” Burke said. “We fought, we battled, we followed a game plan to perfection that I think was really, really effective. TCU is a great team, well coached. We respected them at the highest level coming into this game, but we didn’t come in here like we were planning on losing, and I was really proud of our team’s effort for that, in our fight, in the situation that we’re in this year, and with losing our leading scorer…There’s a lot of things that our team could be down and out about, and they are not and they’re fighting and they’re battling, and just probably as proud as I’ve sat at a podium despite a loss.”\n\nSumayah Sugapong led the way, scoring 11 points in the first quarter. She ended the game with 17 points, 4 rebounds, 4 assists, 1 block, and 3 steals. She was also one of two Arizona players called for technical fouls after making big plays. Those led to four TCU points.\n\n“In a game like this, where we’re sort of the underdog, I think that’s where a lot of us thrive, just coming in competing,” Sugapong said. “I was talking about, really no pressure on us coming into this game. So just going out there, playing hard, and sometimes emotions take over a little bit too much.”\n\nGoing into the week, Burke said that this game would be a prime opportunity for Achol Magot. The 6-foot-7 center would be needed against the 6-foot-7 pair of Clara Silva and Kennedy Basham. It worked. Basham fouled out in eight minutes without scoring.\n\nMagot made her biggest impact in the third quarter. She had six points and three rebounds while drawing several fouls on Silva and Basham. She ended the game with 12 points, 7 rebounds, and 1 assist. She hit 4 of her 8 shots and went 4 for 5 from the free throw line. Most importantly, she had just 3 fouls in 16 minutes of play and was even diving to the floor to get to 50-50 balls.\n\n“Achol had an interesting week, but she was ready when her number was called,” Burkes said. “And I’m just going to continue to challenge Achol to practice hard, to play hard, to be ready for opportunities. Because, you know, she looks a little bit different than anybody else on our team. She looks like the opposing post players, and from a size, physicality standpoint, we do need her presence. This is by far her best game. She was able to play 16 minutes. We haven’t gotten that out of her. She was able to get out there and contribute in a way that she hasn’t so far this season, and we’re going to need that in the second half of Big 12 play. So excited for her to gain that confidence today and build off of it.”\n\nIt wasn’t enough, though. TCU started to pull away halfway through the third quarter. The Horned Frogs were up by eight with 3:37 left in the frame and had a seven-point lead after 30 minutes.\n\nThey kept that momentum in the fourth. Arizona didn’t score over the first 3.5 minutes of the final quarter while TCU hit one after another. The lead hit double digits with 8:49 left in the game and was up to 18 by the time Arizona scored.\n\nLani Cornfield was the third Wildcat with double-figure scoring. She ended with 11 points, 4 rebounds, 5 assists, and 1 block. The block was followed by what the official deemed was an unsportsmanlike stare down, and she picked up Arizona’s second technical foul of the day. It was her fifth foul.\n\nBlessing ‘Adde’ Adebanjo also fouled out for Arizona, but she made an impact before doing so. She scored 9 points on 4-of-5 shooting, grabbed 1 rebound, dished out 1 assist, and had 1 steal in 15 minutes on the court.\n\nArizona will return home to face Kansas on Tuesday, Jan. 20 at 6 p.m. MST. The Wildcats will try to grab their second Big 12 win after losing their last home game to UCF just 24 hours after learning Perdue would not play. They now stand at 10-7 and 1-5 in conference play.\n\nTCU improved to 18-1 and 6-1 in Big 12 play. They earned a share of the Big 12 lead after Kansas State upset No. 17 Texas Tech in Lubbock earlier in the day.",

    "fullText": "Augsburg striker Michael Gregoritsch has commented on what it felt like to return to the Bundesliga so much sooner than expected with one of his old clubs. The Austrian international unfortunately didn’t make much of a mark in Thursday night’s 1-1 draw with Union Berlin beyond accidentally colliding with FCU captain Rani Khedira early. It was nevertheless an emotional occasion for the 31-year-old.\n\n“I felt so sorry,” Gregoritsch remarked in the WWK Arena mixed zone. “I really wanted to avoid him, but he ran into me. I thought he was blocking me, but then he suddenly turned away. Rani is one of my closest friends in football. You can see that I apologized immediately. It was also uncomfortable for me because I didn’t mean to do it. I apologized throughout the entire game and promised Rani our next meal is on me.“\n\nWith his new club fighting relegation, Gregoritsch wished to make clear that he knew precisely what was expected of him. Despite the fact that both he and the Fuggerstädter haven’t gotten off to very good start in 2026 (a bad loss against Borussia Mönchengladbach and the points dropped against Union), Gregoritsch emphasized that he felt things would trend upward.\n\n“I really missed the Bundesliga and am so happy to be back here,” Gregoritsch said. “[coming back from Denmark] I’ve had a longer winter break and not much training rime. One can see that the team is a little unsettled, but they are basically good guys with a lot of quality. As one of the old guys, it’s my job to help. We’re getting better and I’m optimistic.”\n\nFCA head coach Manuel Baum appeared to suggest so at his Friday pre-match press conference. Even though the Thursday Bundesliga fixture leaves the team on a tight turnaround, Baum stressed that he wanted to build a consistent squad.\n\n“There may be some changes, but I’m less in favor of rotating because I believe we need a core,” Baum said. “There are a few here with a Freiburg past. With regard to ‘Gregerl,’ I asked him today and he said he feels really good. So it’s possible that he’ll start again.“",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThis season is the best for the Chicago Bears in quite some time, as they finished the regular season 11-6, winning the NFC North, and have the chance to reach the NFC championship game if they can defeat the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday night.\n\nMany people have stated the reasons they believe the Bears have had a franchise-altering season, such as the hiring of head coach Ben Johnson and the rise of second-year quarterback Caleb Williams. Both have, without a doubt, had a significant positive impact on the team.\n\nHowever, Johnson gave an unlikely reason for the team's success this season: a player who has been in the league for a long time.\n\nMore: Bears' Colston Loveland is 2nd in NFL history with crazy stats, joining Gronk with this record\n\nVeteran backup quarterback Case Keenum received high praise from his head coach for the role he has played this season for Chicago, despite not taking any snaps with the team.\n\n\"He's been tremendous in terms of Caleb's growth. That was really the thought process of bringing him in, a guy with skins on the wall. He's played in big games himself at a high level. He's won big games. He's lost big games. His experience has really been something that all these young players can really lean into,\" Johnson said to the media on Friday.\n\nJohnson makes a great point as Keenum has seen it all in his 13 seasons in the league and has been a servicable backup for most of his years, so even though it doesn't sound ideal, it shouldn't be as surprising that this young Bears team has leaned on the veteran.\n\nKeenum's leadership will be needed for at least one game against one of his former teams, the Rams, which is set to be the team's most formidable opponent yet.\n\nCaleb Williams fires back at Packers’ super fan Lil Wayne after wild tweet\n\nChicago Bears now know who they will face in divisional round of playoffs\n\nBears, Bills, Rams set an NFL playoff record already with crazy comeback history\n\nCaleb Williams planted an image in Packers fans' heads that will haunt them all offseason\n\nCaleb Williams gets emotional paying tribute to Ben Johnson after Bears' playoff win",

But Queta hit him hard twice with elbows, and by the time he got to the locker room in Boston, he knew for sure he had one and he wasn't going to be playing for awhile.\n\n\"I knew then that I had one and that I should just chill,\" Jackson said. \"When it happened I went back to the locker room and I was throwing up and stuff and my head was hurting. The next day, it just kept getting worse and worse and worse. It was a process. I didn't know it was going to be as severe as it was. I thought it was going to be a one- or two-day thing and then I'd be good. But it took a long time.\"\n\nIt was well into the new year before Jackson was cleared to return to basketball activities and after about a week of conditioning he was cleared to play in Saturday's game against the Pistons near his home town of Pontiac, Mich. Jackson said he experienced just about every symptom one could expect while dealing with a concussion.\n\n\"Headaches,\" Jackson said. \"Fogginess. My thoughts were foggy. ... My symptoms were severe. Light sensitivity. Sound sensitivity. I couldn't even be around. I was bad. I was literally just in my room the blinds were shut. I had sunglasses on. It was bad.\"\n\nJackson said he's had about a week and a half to work on conditioning. He said he's good to play but not 100%.\n\n\"I'm in a good spot,\" Jackson said. \"I'm not where I was, but I'm getting there.\"\n\nDustin Dopirak covers the Pacers all season.

They are now at the Buffalo 38-yard line, with a chance to win the game at the two-minute warning.\n\nSutton on 3rd-and-11 🔥\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/01s4CnZUFX\n\n7:20 p.m. FIELD GOAL: The Bills think they might've scored a touchdown but it gets ruled incomplete. However, Buffalo still manages to get some points and extend the lead off of Prater's foot.\n\n7:16 p.m.: Allen puts the city of Buffalo on his back and picks up a first down to keep the drive alive and continue milking the clock.\n\n7:04 p.m.: Bills' defense forces a stop and gives the ball right back to Allen. The Broncos' defense will need to step up to prevent the Bills from adding to their lead.\n\n6:57 p.m. TOUCHDOWN: Allen delivers a dime to his TE to take their first lead since the 1st quarter. The Bills erase a 13-point deficit, and now the pressure falls right back on the Broncos and Nix.\n\nDALTON KINCAID WHAT A CATCH TO TIE IT\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/y4wUrQgjb5\n\n6:56 p.m.: Allen is able to connect with Khalil Shakir for a 46-yard completion. This is now the longest play the Bills have had during this game.\n\n6:45 p.m.: The Buffalo defense is emptying the tank when it comes to pressures on Nix. The Broncos are unable to capitalize on their second Allen turnover of the half and punt the ball right back to the Bills.\n\nPayton elected to attempt to pin the Bills deep rather than extend their lead.\n\n6:40 p.m.: Allen once again gives the ball to the Broncos as he forces a ball into double coverage.

Kincaid takes the pass for a 25-yard gain, which also marks the longest completion for the Bills to this point.\n\nAllen then goes right back to Kincaid to set up a third and short, followed by a tush push for a first down.\n\n6:23 p.m. FIELD GOAL: Buffalo's defense bails them out and holds the Broncos to a field goal after yet again working with a short field. Lutz has been busy and drills another short field goal.\n\nDenver now leads by 13, and Allen will need to show some of that playoff magic if the Bills are to come back against this defensive unit.\n\n6:20 p.m.: History is against the Bills, and the fumble on their opening drive of the second half is not going to help.\n\nThe Bills are 2-13 in the playoffs in franchise history when trailing at halftime.\n\nThey’re down 20-10 in Denver at half after the Broncos scored 10 in the final 30 seconds. pic.twitter.com/y21jeFHLwP\n\n— ESPN (@espn) January 17, 2026\n\n6:18 p.m.: Ball security issues continue for the Bills as Allen is sacked and stripped. Three turnovers in five drives for the Bills and two fumbles in three snaps.\n\nThe Broncos are in a prime position to extend the lead they built.\n\n6:06 p.m.: After the Bills scored the game's first touchdown and then got the ball right back, Denver fans may have been nervous. However, Buffalo has two fumbles that the Broncos not only recovered, but scored points off.\n\nThe Broncos could not have had a better end to the first half, scoring 10 points in 22 seconds. Buffalo will start with the ball, and Allen will look to make up for the costly fumble.\n\n6:00 p.m. FIELD GOAL: After a disastrous fumble by Allen with the half winding down, the Broncos took advantage of it and extended their lead.\n\nBroncos ball!\n\nWhat a break before the half 😳\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/317eodiE90\n\nDenver scored 10 points in the final 22 seconds of the first half.\n\n5:58 p.m. TOUCHDOWN: Nix looked sharp in the two-minute drill, throwing several strikes and picking up yards with his legs.\n\nRedemption for Lil'Jordan Humphrey!\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/2fGMhIkwyb\n\nNix then launched a beautiful 29-yard touchdown to Humphrey to take the lead once again against the Bills. Humphrey dropped a touchdown in the first quarter, but made up for it\n\n5:53 p.m.: The Broncos will be without Pat Bryant after leaving the game with three catches on the game's opening drive.\n\nTroy Franklin is also questionable to return with a hamstring injury. The Broncos will now have to heavily rely on Sutton and Mims, who are already banged up.\n\n5:46 p.m.: Broncos are able to cross midfield with under a minute to go in the half. Nix once again rushed for a first down.\n\nBo scrambling!\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/UcPe85ot1F\n\nDenver is driving and looking to score before halftime.\n\n5:36 p.m. FIELD GOAL: The Bills were unable to answer the Broncos' touchdown with one of their own, but they managed to tie the game with a 33-yard field goal made by Matt Prater.\n\n5:34 p.m.: The Bills put together a good drive on a 24-yard pass to Cook, then faced some adversity after a sack made it 2nd and long.\n\nBeautiful route by the veteran Brandin Cooks on third down\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/8ysFSIOAtr\n\nHowever, Allen connected with Bradin Cooks for a 15-yard pass to keep the drive alive.\n\n5:25 p.m. TOUCHDOWN: Denver makes the most of the Cook fumble and scores on some trickery. Frank Crum, the offensive tackle, caught a touchdown pass from Bo Nix.\n\nFRANK CRUM BIG MAN TD\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/8SEiIm527H\n\nThe Broncos take the lead off of some creativity from Sean Payton.\n\n5:17 p.m.: Cook was drilled by Alex Singleton and fumbled the ball.

They've already picked up 75 yards on only 10 carries.\n\n5:11 p.m.: The Broncos are unable to do anything on their second drive of the game. Courtland Sutton nearly made a diving catch on third down, but it was ruled incomplete.\n\nThe Bills will send Allen and company back onto the field, looking to extend their lead.\n\n5:07 p.m.: At the end of one, both offenses had promising opening drives, but only one was able to capitalize with six. Cook was spectacular on the Bills' first drive, as was Allen.\n\nThe Broncos fumbled on the final play of the opening quarter but recovered. It will be 2 and 10 after the break for Denver\n\n5:04 p.m. TOUCHDOWN: With Cook and Allen dominating Denver with the ground game, Allen only needed to complete four passes.\n\nMecole Hardman playoff TDs are back!\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/CWy8FUMSXh\n\nAllen was able to complete a 4-yard pass to Mecole Hardman to put the Bills on top just before the opening quarter is about to end.\n\n4:55 p.m.: Pat Surtain looked shaken up and is heading towards the blue medical tent. The Broncos certainly cannot afford to lose their all-pro corner.\n\n4:54 p.m.: After having a technical issue with his helmet, Allen was forced to call a timeout. Allen changed his helmet and is now set to go.\n\n4:53 p.m.: James Cook picks up a chunk play on the first play for the Buffalo Bills on offense.

Will Lutz drilled the 28-yarder to open up the scoring.\n\n4:49 p.m.: The Broncos were fortunate that a fumble was overturned due to an offside by the Bills.\n\n4:46 p.m.: On 4th down, the Broncos once again run Nix, and he picks up the first down. The Broncos' offense had picked up four first downs on this drive.\n\n4:43 p.m.: After a completion for a first down on the first throw of the game, Jaleel McLaughlin showed incredible effort to gain five yards. Pat Bryant, who had three catches on the opening drive, was a bit shaken up.\n\nOn the first third down for the Broncos, Nix keeps it for a 5-yard run and first down. The Broncos are driving into Buffalo territory on the opening drive.\n\nBo had the defense fooled on the read option\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/ljd2CTiyI6\n\n4:35 p.m.: Bills' Dorian Williams on special teams was in a huge collision on the opening kickoff and is down, injury timeout in Denver.\n\nThe entire Bills team has come off the sideline to check on Dorian Williams. He is able to get up and come off the field supported by Bills staff.\n\n— Alaina Getzenberg (@agetzenberg) January 17, 2026\n\n4:33 p.m.: The Bills have deferred, which means Bo Nix and the Broncos offense will take the field first.\n\n4:20 p.m.: Josh Allen firing up his guys before they take the field at Denver.

There was always a chance that not every postseason game would be decided in four quarters.\n\nThe divisional round is providing NFL fans with their first look at overtime in the 2025 postseason. The Buffalo Bills forced OT against the Denver Broncos with a late field goal by Matt Prater.\n\nThis marks the sixth overtime playoff game in the last six seasons.\n\nHere's what to know about the overtime rules in the NFL playoffs:\n\nIf the score is tied after regulation, there's another coin toss. Here's what the rules are:\n\nThe overtime period is 15 minutes long.\n\nIt is 10 minutes in the regular season.\n\nEach team gets three timeouts per half (two overtime periods).\n\nEach team will have a possession, but the game does not automatically end if the first team scores a touchdown.\n\nIf the score is still tied after each team gets one possession, the next score wins.\n\nAn exception is made if the team that first possesses the ball commits a safety. The kickoff team wins in this scenario, the same as in the regular season.\n\nExtra points are not attempted if the game ends in a touchdown.\n\nAll replays are initiated by the replay official and not by the coach's challenge.\n\nWild card round: Saturday, Jan. 10 to Monday, Jan. 12, 2026\n\nDivisional round: Saturday, Jan. 17 to Sunday, Jan. 18, 2026\n\nConference championship: Sunday, Jan. 25, 2026\n\nSuper Bowl: Sunday, Feb. 8, 2026\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: NFL overtime rules: What are OT rules in playoffs?",

    "fullText": "Oregon will likely be without point guard Jackson Shelstad for the rest of the season.\n\nCoach Dana Altman said after the Ducks lost 81-71 to Michigan on Jan. 17 — the fourth straight missed game for Shelstad — that tests taken on Friday revealed tendon and ligament damage in his right hand and it may require surgery, the recovery time for which is six to eight weeks.\n\n\"If he has to have surgery, it'll be the season,\" Altman said. \"So, I'm sure that we won't have him the rest of the year. There will be a decision made next week on surgery ... but there's just some tendon and ligament damage, it looks like, that hasn't healed.\"\n\nShelstad injured his hand against Omaha on Dec. 28 and has been sitting out ever since.\n\nThe three-year starter and an all-Big-Ten Conference preseason selection, is second on the team in scoring at 15.6 points per game and leads the Ducks in assists (59) and steals (17).\n\nHe missed the first game of the season as he recovered from surgery after breaking his right hand in a preseason practice. Altman reiterated Saturday that Shelstad's current injury is not related to his injury or surgery from last fall.\n\nOregon was also without starting center Nate Bittle against Michigan. The Ducks' leading scorer was on the bench with a boot on his left foot. Bittle used a scooter to move around without putting pressure on what Altman labeled a \"lower leg\" injury that Bittle suffered Tuesday at Nebraska.\n\nForward Sean Stewart said the team recently held a players-only meeting to address the loss of their top two players and how to move forward.\n\n\"We basically said, everybody's just got to come together, next man up,\" Stewart said. \"Nobody plays less hard against us because Nate and Jackson are out, so we just have to play harder than ever.\"\n\nChris Hansen covers University of Oregon football, men’s basketball, track and field, cross country and softball for The Register-Guard.

    "description": "Join Mile High Report to discuss the action from this Divisional Round game between the Denver Broncos and Buffalo Bills.",
    "fullText": "The AFC’s top seeded Denver Broncos (14-3) will host the Buffalo Bills (13-5) in the Divisional Round of the NFL Playoffs. The action around the country is centered around Josh Allen and his quest for a championship, but very little attention has been paid to the rise of these Broncos from castaway to AFC powerhouse. Can they send Allen and the Bills packing and punch their ticket to the AFC Championship Game? We certainly hope so!\n\nKickoff is set for 2:30 p.m. Mile High time on Saturday, January 17, 2026 at Empower Field at Mile High in Denver, Colorado. You can watch the live stream of the game through FuboTV or on CBS. The game will be called by Jim Nantz (play-by-play), Tony Romo (analyst), and Tracy Wolfson (sideline). You can also check local Broncos radio network affiliate stations.\n\nEverything we have on this game\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nAccording to FanDuel, the Broncos opened as slight home underdogs, but are now slightly favored over the Bills at 1.5-points. I still feel like they will need to be the overdogs in this game and come out with a win. While the odds have them slightly favored, no one else nationally are picking them to win really. I hope for a good old fashioned beat down, but that hasn’t been their style all season long. Give me another hard-fought, climb higher type win.\n\nPrediction: Broncos 24, Bills 22.\n\nA look at how the Denver Broncos went from giving up 70 points in Miami in 2023 … to being the AFC’s No. 1 seed this season.\n\nProduced by @AjayAtayee and Ellis Williams. pic.twitter.com/6Cqg31nuMr\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) January 17, 2026\n\nBo making it look easy.\n\nBUFvsDEN– 4:30pm ET on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/SCIvhKbbcU\n\nFeels like a Super Bowl 50 reunion at Broncos-Bills.

    "fullText": "Irrespective of your programming language of choice, calling C functions is often a necessity. For the longest time, the only standard way to call C was the Java Native Interface (JNI). But it was so painful that few dared to do it. I have heard it said that it was deliberately painful so that people would be enticed to use pure Java as much as possible.\n\nSince Java 22, there is a new approach called the Foreign Function & Memory API in java.lang.foreign. Let me go through step by step.\n\nYou need a Linker and a SymbolLookup instance from which you will build a MethodHandle that will capture the native function you want to call.\n\nTo load the SymbolLookup instance for your library (called mylibrary), you may do so as follows:\n\nThe native library file should be on your java.library.path path, or somewhere on the default library paths. (You can pass it to your java executable as -Djava.library.path=something).\n\nAlternatively, you can use SymbolLookup.libraryLookup or other means of loading\n\nthe library, but System.loadLibrary should work well enough.\n\nYou have the lookup, you can grab the address of a function like so:\n\nThis returns an Optional<MemorySegment>. You can grab the MemorySegment like so:\n\nOnce you have your MemorySegment, you can pass it to your linker to get a MethodHandle which is close to a callable function:\n\nThe functiondescr must describe the returned value and the function parameters that your function takes.\n\nIf you pass a pointer and get back a long value, you might proceed as follows:\n\nThat is, the first parameter is the returned value.\n\nFor function returning nothing, you use FunctionDescriptor.ofVoid.\n\nThe MethodHandle can be called almost like a normal Java function:\n\nmyfunc.invokeExact(parameters). It always returns an Object which means that if it should return a long, it will return a Long. So a cast might be necessary.\n\nYou can allocate C data structures from Java that you can pass to your native code by using an Arena. Let us say that you want to create an instance like\n\nYou could do it in this manner:\n\nYou can then pass myseg as a pointer to a data structure in C.\n\nYou often get an array with a try clause like so:\n\nThere are many types of arenas: confined, global, automatic, shared. The confined arenas are accessible from a single thread. A shared or global arena is accessible from several threads. The global and automatic arenas are managed by the Java garbage collector whereas the confined and shared arenas are managed explicitly, with a specific lifetime.\n\nSo, it is fairly complicated but manageable. Is it fast? To find out, I call from Java a C library I wrote with support for binary fuse filters. They are a fast alternative to Bloom filters.\n\nYou don’t need to know what any of this means, however. Keep in mind that I wrote a Java library called jfusebin which calls a C library. Then I also have a pure Java implementation and I can compare the speed.\n\nI should first point out that even if calling the C function did not include any overhead, it might still be slower because the Java compiler is unlikely to inline a native function. However, if you have a pure Java function, and it is relatively small, it can get inlined and you get all sorts of nice optimizations like constant folding and so forth.\n\nThus I can overestimate the cost of the overhead. But that’s ok. I just want a ballpark measure.\n\nIn my benchmark, I check for the presence of a key in a set. I have one million keys in the filter. I can ask whether a key is not present in the filter.\n\nI find that the library calling C can issue 44 million calls per second using the 8-bit binary fuse filter. I reach about 400 million calls per second using the pure Java implementation.\n\nThus I measure an overhead of about 20 ns per C function calls from Java using a macBook (M4 processor).\n\nObviously, in my case, because the Java library is so fast, the 20 ns becomes too much. But it is otherwise a reasonable overhead.\n\nDaniel Lemire, \"A new way to call C from Java: how fast is it?,\" in Daniel Lemire's blog, January 17, 2026, https://lemire.me/blog/2026/01/17/a-new-way-to-call-c-from-java-how-fast-is-it/.\r\n [BibTeX]",

    "fullText": "\"We don't need 10+ AWS accounts. It's overkill for us—we can do this later after we launch. This will slow down product development and add unnecessary complexity.\"\n\nI've heard this pushback dozens of times. And here's the thing: the instincts behind it aren't wrong.\n\nIt can feel like over-investing in infrastructure too early. It is more accounts than most people new to AWS start with. And if you've used multi-account setups before without good tooling, they absolutely can feel cumbersome and slow.\n\nOn top of that, understanding someone else's infrastructure code is always harder than code you wrote yourself, and you don't even know the final product architecture yet—shipping the product has to be the priority.\n\nThe counterproposal usually sounds reasonable:\n\n\"We just need dev, staging, and production accounts. Anything more is unnecessary complexity.\"\n\nHere's the thing: this is correct. To operate any product on AWS, you need a minimum of one account per SDLC stage—dev, staging, production. That's the baseline.\n\nThe misunderstanding comes when you look at this holistically: what does the organization need to operate securely? There's more than your software at stake.\n\nThe \"three accounts\" view only considers the application. It ignores everything else the organization needs to function—and that's where it breaks down the moment you start asking concrete questions.\n\nIf they're centralized—and they should be for security, compliance, and tamper resistance—they can't live in dev/staging/prod. Hence an audit account.\n\nWhere does your container registry live?\n\nIf you rebuild container images per account, you're triplicating images and not running what you tested. If you promote artifacts—which you should—a shared account is the logical solution. Hence an artifacts account.\n\nIn every account? That's 3× the cost and operational overhead. If centralized, how do they securely talk to services across accounts? Hence an automation account and a transit gateway. Don't think you need self-hosted runners? Make sure you have other ways to manage Kubernetes and RDS databases on private subnets.\n\nNone of these are future-state problems—they show up fast.\n\nWhen you put it all together—answering each of those concrete questions—you end up with:\n\nThat's 9–10 accounts for a minimal level of isolation.\n\nNot because someone decided \"9–10 is the right number.\" Because each account answers a specific question that you'll have to answer anyway. The accounts aren't arbitrary—they're the natural result of thinking through where things actually need to live.\n\nDoes this seem like a lot? Consider what happens without these boundaries:\n\nThe accounts aren't bureaucracy. They're guardrails that let you move faster, not slower.\n\nHere's the thing: you can add accounts later. That's not the myth.\n\nThe myth is believing it's easy or cheap to do later. It's not.\n\nAdding accounts later requires complex migrations, scheduling and coordination across teams, and untangling months or years of decisions built on faulty assumptions—like CIDR allocations that don't support peering or future growth.\n\nSome accounts are genuinely optional. If you're never going to have self-hosted runners, skip the automation account. If you're never using AWS as a DNS registrar, skip the DNS account. No big deal.\n\nBut some decisions are foundational—and brutal to change later:\n\nThe accounts themselves might sit empty for a while. But the architectural decisions you make on day one—CIDR allocation strategy, naming conventions, network topology—those get baked in immediately.\n\nHere's the real message: unless you operate today like you'll have multiple accounts, adding more accounts later won't make a difference.\n\nYou need to instill multi-account practices now in how you architect your applications and base your assumptions. It affects everything: network CIDR allocations, naming conventions, S3 bucket naming, Terraform state storage, DNS architecture, IAM trust relationships.\n\nCreate the boundaries now. Use them as the problems present themselves. If you wait until you need them, you're not just creating accounts—you're untangling everything you built assuming they didn't exist.\n\nThere's another reason account boundaries matter that's easy to underestimate:\n\nVPCs only give you network isolation. Accounts are the only hard IAM boundary AWS gives you.\n\nIf your goal is developer autonomy—letting engineers move fast without stepping on each other—fewer accounts actually makes that harder, not easier.\n\nYou end up either doing fragile IAM gymnastics, or giving everyone administrative access—which is very hard to walk back. Clean account boundaries let devs have broad access in some places and almost none in others—especially around production and security.\n\nAnd here's the uncomfortable truth: nothing is harder to craft than IAM policies.\n\nGetting IAM right in a single-account setup where you need to simulate multi-account boundaries is exponentially more complex than just having the boundaries in the first place.\n\nThis might look like over-engineering. It's not—it's choosing where to pay the cost.\n\nHere's the key: it's only complicated if you don't have the right tooling, conventions, and a framework that ties it together.\n\nWith the right tooling (like Atmos), managing 10 accounts isn't harder than managing 3. The complexity objection assumes you're doing this manually or piecing it together yourself. A proper framework handles the multi-account orchestration for you.\n\nSimple account setups optimize for getting started. Multi-account setups optimize for not having to unlearn assumptions later.\n\nYou're not adding complexity. You're preventing it.\n\nThe complexity of multi-team access, centralized logging, artifact promotion, and network segmentation is coming whether you plan for it or not. The only question is whether you have clean boundaries when it arrives, or whether you're retrofitting them into a single-account monolith.\n\nI genuinely understand the pushback. The instinct to ship fast and avoid premature complexity is exactly right in most contexts.\n\nBut AWS account boundaries aren't premature complexity—they're deferred simplicity. The complexity exists regardless. The only question is whether you've given it clean places to live.\n\nStarting clean is weeks. Untangling later is months.\n\nIf you're navigating this conversation internally and want help making the case—or just want to talk through the tradeoffs with someone who's been there—talk to an engineer. No sales theater. Just engineers who understand both the technical reality and the organizational dynamics at play.",

    "fullText": "Umarell (Italian spelling of the Bolognese Emilian word umarèl, Emilian pronunciation: [umaˈrɛːl]; plural umarî) are men of retirement age who spend their time watching construction sites, especially roadworks – stereotypically with hands clasped behind their back and offering unrequested advice to the workers.[1] Its literal meaning is \"little man\" (also umaréin).[2] The term is employed as lighthearted mockery or self-deprecation.\n\nThe modern term was popularised in 2005 by local writer Danilo Masotti[3][4] through three books and an associated blog.[5][6] The word was included in the Italian Zingarelli dictionary in 2021[7][8][9][10][11] and in 2024 was included by Language Council of Sweden in the annual list of new Swedish words – the Språkrådets nyordslista [sv].[12][13]\n\nIn 2015, the city of Riccione, approximately 130 kilometres (80 miles) southeast of Bologna, allocated an €11,000 budget to pay a wage to umarells to oversee worksites in the city – counting the number of trucks in and out to ensure materials were delivered/removed according to the receipts, and guarding against theft when the site was otherwise unattended.[14] The town of San Lazzaro di Savena, 6 km (3+1⁄2 mi) to the South-East of Bologna, awarded the \"Umarell of the year\" prize to a local resident, Franco Bonini.[15][16]\n\nIn 2016, the local cultural association called Succede solo a Bologna (\"It only happens in Bologna\") released the \"Umarèl card\" as a fundraiser for continued restoration of the San Petronio church.[17][18] Separately, a mobile app called Umarells was released that tracked the location of ongoing roadworks and construction sites.[19][20] The fast food restaurant chain Burger King also \"hired\" several umarells as part of a social media marketing campaign promoting its increased presence in the country.[21]\n\nIn July 2017, the Bologna city council's \"consultative commission for street naming\" approved the naming of a public square to the East of the city centre in the Cirenaica district Piazzetta degli Umarells in recognition of the local fame of the concept and the name – noting with conscious irony that the square was under construction at the time.[22][23][24][25]\n\nIn April 2018, the public square was inaugurated by city councillor Matteo Lepore, the district president Simone Borsari, the \"lord of the umarells\" Franco Bonini, the stand-up comedian Maurizio Pagliari (Dulio Pizzocchi), and the writer Danilo Masotti.[26] A year later the street-sign for the square was stolen.[27]\n\nIn April 2020, the comic magazine Topolino dedicated an episode to the umarell Gerindo Persichetti.[28] In December 2020 in Pescara, the real estate developer Sarra installed windows to allow Umarells to observe three construction sites.[29][30] Since 2019, an annual calendar has been sold in Bologna newsstands. In 2021, a board game La Giornata dell’Umarell (An Umarell's Day) was released.[31]\n\nHaving officially entered the Swedish language in 2024,[13] in October 2025 the municipality of Karlskoga formally inaugurated \"Umarell benches\" (sv: umarell-bänkar) for locals to monitor the construction of a local bathhouse.[32][33]",

    "description": "How Dropstone Horizon Mode decouples reasoning depth from context length to enable 24+ hour autonomous engineering workflows.",
    "fullText": "Today we are releasing a technical overview of Horizon Mode, a new distributed runtime architecture designed to solve the \"Linearity Barrier\" in autonomous software engineering.\n\nCurrent Foundation Models (FMs) excel at short-burst generation but suffer from stochastic degradation as reasoning chains extend. In internal benchmarks, we observed that while standard transformers maintain high fidelity for tasks under 1 hour, their probability of maintaining a valid state drops exponentially as workflows exceed 24 hours.\n\nHorizon Mode addresses this by shifting from a monolithic \"next-token\" prediction model to a Recursive Swarm Topology. By orchestrating thousands of ephemeral, specialized agents, we have successfully demonstrated the ability to maintain coherent engineering logic over extended time horizons with a 99% reduction in compute costs compared to homogeneous swarms.\n\nIn traditional \"Monolithic Contextualization,\" an agent’s intelligence is strictly bound by its sliding context window. As a complex engineering task progresses, intermediate reasoning steps fill the window, forcing the model to either compress (lose detail) or truncate (forget instructions). We refer to this phenomenon as Instruction Drift.\n\nFor mission-critical engineering, drift is unacceptable. A security patch written at Hour 20 must strictly adhere to the safety constraints defined at Hour 0.\n\nHorizon Mode moves beyond the single-agent paradigm. Instead of asking one model to \"think harder\" for longer, we virtualize the cognitive process into a distributed search tree.\n\nWe treat compute as a liquid asset. Horizon Mode utilizes a tiered topology to optimize the \"Intelligence-to-Cost\" ratio:\n\nThis ensures that expensive, deep reasoning is only applied to high-value logic paths, not trial-and-error loops.\n\nTo prevent context saturation, we developed the Dynamic Distillation & Deployment (D3) Engine. Unlike standard RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) which relies on semantic similarity, D3 utilizes a Quad-Partite Cognitive Topology.\n\nAs agency increases, so does the risk of Instrumental Convergence (e.g., an agent disabling a firewall to \"fix\" a connection error).\n\nHorizon Mode implements a \"Shared-Nothing\" architecture with a Flash-Gated Consensus Protocol. Agents cannot communicate via natural language. Instead, they emit Boolean signals.\n\nWhen a solution is proposed, the swarm freezes. A dedicated Adversarial Monitor verifies the code against a Hierarchical Verification Stack (CstackC_{stack}). Only solutions that pass Syntactic (L1L_1), Static (L2L_2), and Functional (L3L_3) analysis are committed to the ledger.\n\nWe evaluated Horizon Mode on the internal \"Deep-Sec\" benchmark, which tests an agent's ability to refactor a legacy codebase while maintaining strict security compliance.\n\nHorizon Mode represents a step toward High-Assurance AI. By decoupling reasoning from the limitations of a single context window, we are paving the way for agents that can act as reliable, long-term partners in complex engineering challenges.\n\nWe are currently releasing the Technical Report detailing the architecture and safety protocols.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has turned to his favorite form of leverage in his effort to annex Greenland: Tariffs.\n\nTrump said on Saturday he would impose on February 1 an additional 10% tariff on Denmark, which controls Greenland, as well as Sweden, Norway, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Finland, unless they agree to a deal to hand over Greenland to the United States.\n\nThe president said he would raise those tariffs to 25% in June if they did not comply. All of those countries have already been paying some form of tariff since Trump's Liberation Day levies went into effect in August 2025.\n\n\"This tariff will be due and payable until such time a deal is reached for the complete and total purchase,\" he said in a Truth Social post.\n\nTrump's threat comes as world leaders and CEOs gather in Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum. The president is expected to address the conference in person on Wednesday.\n\nTrump has had Greenland on his mind since his first term, but has ramped up the rhetoric since the US raid in Venezuela that netted Nicolás Maduro.\n\nThe president says US control of Greenland is a national security issue. The Arctic country sits at a strategic point between Russia and China. The US already has a military base, known as the Pituffik Space Base, on the island. Greenland is also a base of critical natural resources, including lithium, gold, iron ore, and oil.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider last week, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Trump administration was considering a range of options to pursue Greenland, including \"utilizing the US Military.\"\n\nTrump's new tariff threat comes as the Supreme Court reviews whether the president has the authority to impose broad, sweeping tariffs on whatever country he wants — and there's a chance it could rule against the president.",

    "fullText": "The AFL-CIO, the country's largest network of labor unions representing some 15 million workers, says ICE is a threat to workers.\n\n\"The Trump administration's militarized immigration enforcement is putting innocent working people in danger,\" the AFL-CIO said in a post on X on Saturday. \"America's unions have your backs.\"\n\nA group of local unions in Minnesota, meanwhile, has endorsed a planned statewide economic blackout in response to ICE actions in the state.\n\nThe Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation, which is affiliated with the AFL-CIO, first announced its endorsement alongside other regional bodies on Friday.\n\n\"The Minnesota labor movement is united against the violent ICE occupation of our beloved cities that has directly impacted union members, our workplaces and our families,\" the group said in a press release.\n\nDozens of community, faith, and union groups are organizing the Day of Truth and Freedom, a call to action asking Minnesotans to avoid work, school, and shopping on January 23 to pause the economy. There will also be a rally and march in downtown Minneapolis at 2 p.m. local time.\n\n\"We will gather with family, neighbors, and community to show Minnesota's moral heart and economic power,\" organizers said in a Facebook post.\n\nOrganizers listed several demands, including that ICE leave Minnesota and that federal funding for ICE be scrapped in the upcoming congressional budget.\n\nThe Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation told Business Insider that ICE's presence is disrupting residents' daily lives.\n\n\"Working people from across sectors — hospitality, healthcare, education, custodial, construction, public works — are being targeted,\" the group said in a statement.\n\nThousands of ICE officers have descended on Minnesota as part of Operation Metro Surge, launched on December 1. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a press release earlier this month that the operation was targeting criminal activity among immigrants in the state.\n\n\"Under President Trump, we will expose and deliver accountability for the rampant fraud and criminality happening in Minnesota. You won't steal from Americans or break our laws and get away with it,\" she said.\n\nThe Trump administration has criticized cities like Minneapolis that have passed so-called \"sanctuary\" laws preventing city resources and police from supporting federal immigration agents. In a statement shared on Friday, the White House said sanctuary cities create \"a climate of hostility that endangers federal officers and incites violence.\" Earlier in the week, the administration said it would cut federal funding to sanctuary cities.\n\nBusiness Insider reached out to ICE, the Department of Homeland Security, and the White House for comment.\n\nMany residents, meanwhile, have criticized the tactics that federal agents are using to locate and detain individuals. Tensions in the state skyrocketed after ICE officer Jonathan Ross fatally shot Renee Good, a 37-year-old American citizen from Minneapolis, on January 7, leading to a wave of protests and outcry.\n\nDays after the shooting, Minnesota's attorney general filed a lawsuit on behalf of Minneapolis, St. Paul, and the state against Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, seeking to end the operation.\n\n\"As a result of this surge, municipalities have been forced to divert local law enforcement resources away from their normal public safety duties, emergency responder resources have been strained, schools have been forced into lockdowns and closures, businesses have been forced to close, and the rights of Minnesotans have been violated time and time again,\" a press release from the Minnesota Attorney General's Office said.\n\nHomeland Security said officers have arrested over 2,500 individuals during Operation Metro Surge so far.\n\nCorrection: January 17, 2026 — Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this story misstated that the AFL-CIO had endorsed the January 23 economic blackout in Minnesota. It has not publicly expressed a position.",

    "description": "We moved from Texas to Denver and downsized our home, gaining more time together, walkability, community, and freedom for our kids.",
    "fullText": "In July 2025, my husband, Zach, and I moved our family of four from the suburbs of Ft Worth, Texas, to Denver.\n\nAfter nearly 10 years of marriage, two kids, and three work-related moves, it was finally time to settle in a place of our choosing. This time, we didn't just want a change of scenery; we wanted a change of lifestyle.\n\nBut finding a house in the bustling city neighborhood of our dreams within our budget meant downsizing — drastically.\n\nMoving from our 3,300-square-foot home to a 2,300-square-foot bungalow with 1,200 square feet of actual living space (the rest being unfinished basement) wasn't easy. It meant swapping our large kitchen island for a small dining table. It meant no more master bath soaking tub, my refuge from life's stresses on more occasions than I could count. And it meant my kids giving up their separate rooms to share one.\n\nBut what we've gained in the quality and quantity of time spent together is worth every bit of lost square footage.\n\nOur bigger house in Texas required more upkeep, and we were more than happy to give that up for extra free time on the weekends. Now, we spend our time visiting attractions such as the Denver Zoo and the Denver Museum of Nature and Science. We're fostering our kids' curiosity, exploring new places together. Our everyday life feels more special and meaningful because these shared experiences amplify our family connection.\n\nWe're also getting out in nature more. Aside from weekend hiking and skiing adventures, our days revolve around outdoor living. We walk everywhere we can, including restaurants, parks, and even Trader Joe's, which is beneficial because driving to Trader Joe's means parking at Trader Joe's, and nobody enjoys that. Our moods are lighter, and our stresses are reduced.\n\nThe first time we walked to a restaurant instead of driving, it felt like we were on vacation. Our lives had always been car-dependent, but that's no longer the case. The kids laughed and raced each other down the sidewalk. We marvelled at the mature trees and brightly colored flowers lining 7th Avenue Parkway. There was no timeline or rushing, just the joy of being present. When we made our way home after an alfresco dinner at Postino, I asked my son if he liked walking to dinner. He asked simply, \"Can we do this every day?\"\n\nZach and I frequently sit on our front porch while our boys play with neighborhood kids, a first for us. Having houses so close together makes it easier to meet people and form real connections. We know almost every household on our block, and we regularly visit with our closest neighbors. We even enjoyed our first block party in August, which fell on my eldest's birthday, and according to him, it was his \"Best birthday ever!\"\n\nOur boys run between yards while we chat with new friends. They are experiencing a childhood closer to the one we grew up with. They're building confidence and finding their place, and that's translating to more smiles and fewer tantrums. Zach and I are finding our village, and parenthood feels less solitary.\n\nOn a recent trip back to Texas for Thanksgiving, I texted our next-door neighbor to let her know we'd be out of town. Without even asking, she offered to take in our mail. It may be a small gesture, but that sense of community is priceless to us.\n\nDownsizing has also allowed our kids to play more independently in an outdoor space that feels safe and protected. We have an unobstructed line of sight to the backyard, and no matter where my husband and I are in the house, we can hear them if they need us. The result has been hours of creative play, building campsites and outdoor kitchens, playing soccer and baseball, and having water balloon fights or Nerf battles.\n\nMost evenings, my kids are in the backyard playing games and getting dirty. When the weather is nice, they run around with their friends down the street. I would never have felt comfortable not knowing every move my kids were making before, but here, where everyone is watching out, and I can wave at my kids down the block to signal when it's time to come home, less space means more freedom.\n\nOur downsized life isn't always perfect. Despite all our decluttering efforts, we're still left with more stuff than we can accommodate. We also struggle with the lack of privacy, and at times, our smaller shared space feels more claustrophobic than cozy. However, downsizing for an urban lifestyle has given us the opportunity to live beyond our four walls, and that's worth more than any amount of space could ever be.",

    "title": "Trump announces he will sue JPMorgan ‘over the next two weeks’ for allegedly ‘DEBANKING’ him",
    "description": "The president also ruled out the bank’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, as a possible pick for Fed chair.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump announced Saturday that he will be suing the investment banking company JPMorgan Chase within “the next two weeks” for allegedly “DEBANKING” him after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection.\n\nTrump has claimed that the investment bank closed or restricted his accounts following the riot, effectively cutting him off from longstanding banking relationships. He has framed the action as politically motivated retaliation, arguing banks acted under pressure from the Biden administration. Trump has increasingly folded this into a broader narrative of “debanking” conservatives.\n\nJPMorgan has denied closing accounts for political reasons.\n\nDuring the 2024 campaign, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon had been floated for Treasury secretary by the president, but their relationship has since soured. Trump in August went after Dimon’s bank, as well as Bank of America, accusing them of discriminating against him in recent years.\n\nEarlier in 2025, the Trump Organization sued Capital One, accusing the bank of improperly cutting off access to the business, which was founded by the president’s late father and was helmed by Trump himself before he entered politics, following the Capitol attack.\n\nThe president also took issue with a Wall Street Journal story, which reported that he offered the Federal Reserve chair position to Dimon. “A front page Article in The Fake News Wall Street Journal states, without any verification, that I offered Jamie Dimon, of JPMorgan Chase, the job of Fed Chairman. This statement is totally untrue, there was never such an offer,” Trump wrote in his Truth Social post.\n\n“Why wouldn’t The Wall Street Journal call me to ask whether or not such an offer was made? I would have very quickly told them, ‘NO,’ and that would have been the end of the story,” Trump added in the post. “Why would I give it to Jamie? No such offer was made there, or even thought of, either. The Wall Street Journal ought to do better ‘fact checking,’ or its already strained credibility will continue to DIVE.”\n\nTrump seemed to be pointing to a story from the Journal published Wednesday, which reported that Trump offered Dimon the role earlier last year. Dimon took that as a joke, according to the Journal, citing people briefed on the discussion.\n\nDimon, asked in an interview with Bloomberg published Thursday whether he’d take the role, said: \"Absolutely, positively no chance, no way, no how, for any reason.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly lashed out at Dimon, dismissing his warnings that the Justice Department’s criminal probe into Fed Chair Jerome Powell, for whom the bank CEO said he has “enormous respect,” could threaten central bank independence. Tensions escalated further as JPMorgan publicly opposed Trump’s proposal to cap credit-card interest rates, with bank executives warning the move would shrink credit and hurt consumers.\n\n\"It would be very bad for consumers, very bad for the economy,\" JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum told reporters on the bank’s earnings call last Tuesday.",

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Hundreds of anti-ICE protesters in Minneapolis chased off a small group of far-right activists who had vowed to march on a neighborhood where many immigrants live on Saturday, stoking tensions in a city on edge after the ​killing of Renee Good by a federal immigration agent 10 days ago.\n\nWaving signs and screaming chants that called for U.S. Immigration and Customs ‌Enforcement and Border Patrol agents to leave Minneapolis, the anti-ICE protesters gathered downtown near City Hall. Scores of them moved forward, forcing about 10 far-right demonstrators against the outside of the municipal ‌government center within minutes. Some in the crowd tossed water balloons that soaked the right-wing demonstrators as temperatures hit -4 degrees Fahrenheit (-20 Celsius) with the wind chill.\n\nPolice maintained their distance as the dueling protests played out. About an hour after the rallies began, the tiny contingent of right-wing activists quickly walked a few blocks away to a hotel, hounded by hundreds of anti-ICE protesters who screamed obscenities and told them to get out of the city. A few scuffles broke out, but Reuters ⁠did not observe any serious violence.\n\nONLINE INFLUENCER REPORTS STABBING ‌ATTEMPT\n\nJake Lang, an online right-wing influencer and one of more than 1,500 people pardoned by President Donald Trump after their criminal convictions related to the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, organized what he called an “anti-fraud” rally. At no point ‍could Lang's voice be heard by the crowd.\n\nLater, Lang posted on X that he was stabbed during a scuffle but that his protective vest blocked the attempt. Reuters could not verify his account.\n\nMinneapolis police said in an email to Reuters they were aware of Lang's social media post, but no official report had been filed with the department. ​Police had received no reports of injuries related to the protests from victims.\n\nCamera feeds showed some people who appeared to be injured, police said, but ‌those individuals left before officers could contact them.\n\nThe anti-ICE protest was organized by the People’s Action Coalition Against Trump.\n\nTrump has repeatedly invoked a scandal around the theft of federal funds intended for social-welfare programs in Minnesota as a rationale for sending thousands of immigration enforcement agents into Minnesota. The president and administration officials have repeatedly singled out the state's community of Somali immigrants.\n\n\"We're here to support our Somali neighbors; they asked for their white allies to show up for them,\" said Laura, 56, who, like all protesters interviewed, asked that their last name not be used for fear of retribution by the federal government. \"I'm here ⁠to exercise my First Amendment right because my neighbors can't, they're too afraid to ​leave their house.\"\n\nLang, who has made anti-Muslim and antisemitic comments, has said he wants to secure ​the U.S. for white Christians. He has been present at small pro-ICE rallies in Minneapolis this week and has targeted Somali immigrants, most of whom are Muslim.\n\nSome 3,000 agents from ICE and Border Patrol have descended on Minneapolis and St. Paul in ‍recent weeks. An ICE agent fatally shot ⁠Good, a U.S. citizen and mother of three, after she drove away after being ordered by ICE agents to exit her vehicle. The officer who shot Good was positioned in front of her car on the left. DHS has said he was hit by the car and ⁠feared for his life, though videos show the agent remaining on his feet and raise questions about how much contact the car made with him.\n\nThe situation has set Minnesota’s Democratic leadership ‌at odds with Trump, whose Justice Department has opened an investigation into Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey.",

Joris Seginds added the extras.\n\nIreland prop Tadhg Furlong came off injured and was replaced by Thomas Clarkson, while soon after Harry Byrne put Leinster's first points on the board with a penalty.\n\nBayonne restored their seven-point advantage when Segonds, the top points scorer in the Top 14, landed a kick from 45 metres after Leo Cullen's side infringed at a line-out.\n\nClarkson then scrambled over the line but the officials adjudged that there had been a double movement as he attempted to ground.\n\nFifteen minutes into the second half Leinster drew level with a converted try from Sheehan.\n\nPrendergast made a break and threw a wide pass to Jimmy O'Brien, who did well to ride a tackle before off-loading inside to the Ireland hooker, who produced a trademark burst of pace to scurry over.\n\nA second penalty of the match for Segonds restored Bayonne's lead and soon after O'Brien went over after getting on the end of Prendergast's grubber kick but replays showed that the full-back had spilled the ball as he went over the line.\n\nSegonds passed up the opportunity to extend the lead as his penalty sailed wide of the posts after Sheehan was penalised for collapsing the maul.\n\nWith six minutes remaining Leinster finally breached their opponents' defences again when Byrne chipped ahead and the ball bounced favourably for Prendergast, who dotted down between the posts.\n\nDeegan dived over in the corner in the final minute to increase the winning margin.\n\nBayonne: C Tiberghien; T Spring, S Maqala, M Tuilagi, Y Orabe; J Segonds, H Jantjies; I Calles, L Martin, J Tagi; E Johnson, L Paulos; A Fischer, A Iturria (capt), N Lomidze.\n\nReplacements: F Bosch, E Tumania, E Setiano, A Garcia Iandolino, B Heguy, M Ariceta, G Martocq, V Hannoun.\n\nLeinster: J O'Brien; T O'Brien; G Ringrose, R Henshaw; J Kenny; H Byrne, J Gibson-Park; J Boyle, R Kelleher, T Furlong; RG Snyman, J Ryan; M Deegan, J van der Flier, C Doris (capt).\n\nReplacements: D Sheehan, J Cahir, T Clarkson, J McCarthy, S Penny, L McGrath, S Prendergast, R Ioane.",

    "description": "Final Score pundit Aaron McLean gives his five takeaways from what we learned across the Championship, League One and League Two this weekend.",
    "fullText": "Former Peterborough United and Hull City striker and Final Score pundit Aaron McLean gives his five takeaways from across the Championship, League One and League Two this weekend.\n\nChampionship leaders Coventry came back from 1-0 down to beat Leicester and end their three-game winless run, while fourth-placed Millwall defeated in-form Watford to stay in contention at the top.\n\nMcLean: \"The beginning of the season was incredible for Coventry but they have, by their own admission, hit a bit of a tough patch - so to get their first win in four league games will have done them the world of good.\n\n\"Frank Lampard will be feeling a lot brighter this evening. To come from behind and show the character they showed, and for Ellis Simms and Haji Wright to get back in the goals, I think everything is pointing back in the right direction.\n\n\"The most important thing after Middlesbrough won last night was to make sure they did their job and they did.\n\n\"Tuesday's game with in-form Millwall looks like it could be a great one for the neutral.\n\n\"I think what they have done so far has been absolutely incredible. I hope they can maintain it. They're not a team who will blow teams away but what they will do is grind points out.\n\n\"To go away to Watford, who on their day can beat anyone in this division and had been in fabulous form, and come away with the points and a clean sheet will show what they are about.\n\n\"They will be thinking this could be their season.\"\n\nSouthampton's poor form continued as they fell to a 2-1 home defeat by Hull City to stretch their run without a victory to seven matches.\n\nMcLean: \"The momentum for Southampton has dwindled away.\n\n\"They had that new manager bounce but over the past few weeks they have almost reverted to type and when they concede a goal it's that 'here we go again' syndrome and they can't seem to shake it..\n\n\"They desperately need a good win to get the feeling back.\n\n\"It feels like they will struggle to get anywhere near the play-offs.\n\n\"First of all they need to get some clean sheets. They're not keeping clean sheets and that is not giving them an opportunity to go and take something.\n\n\"If they can just go and grind out a couple of 1-0 wins then that will give them the confidence that they can go and be a bit more expansive.\n\n\"That is what the squad has been built in that mould but now they need to tighten up.\n\n\"At the moment it isn't working and they're getting punished.\"\n\nNew West Brom boss Eric Ramsay saw his side battle back from two goals down only to lose 3-2 at home to second-placed Middlesbrough on Friday. Norwich's 2-1 win at Wrexham on Saturday leaves them four points behind the Baggies before Tuesday's game between the two sides.\n\nMcLean: \"Going back to Friday night's game between West Brom and Middlesbrough, I feel like new boss Eric Ramsay has a huge job on his hands.\n\n\"They lost to an unbelievable strike in their last league game at Leicester and then they did so well to come back to 2-2 to Middlesbrough and then to lose so late on, I feel sorry for them.\n\n\"That has been their Achilles' heel though, they have conceded late goals time and time again.\n\n\"At this stage of the year you find yourselves in that position because your performances aren't good enough. Away from home their results have been abysmal and they find themselves in a lot of trouble.\n\n\"I look at Norwich, who they play on Tuesday in what looks like another great match, they have got that new manager bounce under Philippe Clement, and the Baggies need that now.\n\n\"It looks bleak but there is time to turn it around.\"\n\nLeague One leaders Cardiff City won 2-1 at third-placed Bradford City to strengthen their position at the top, while at the bottom, Doncaster claimed just a second league win since September with a 1-0 success at fellow strugglers AFC Wimbledon.\n\nMcLean: \"I look at Cardiff as the strongest team in that league and they will just be looking to keep Lincoln at arm's length.\n\n\"The Imps are the most in-form team in the division but let a two-goal lead slip to draw 2-2 at Luton today.\n\n\"I think if Cardiff finish above Lincoln then they will have won the league.\n\n\"I also like what Mansfield, who beat bottom side Port Vale 3-0 today, are doing. They've got momentum, they've got confidence and in Nigel Clough they've got a brilliant manager.\n\n\"They're winning games and getting a good level of consistency, if they can keep doing that then will put themselves in the play-off race.\n\n\"Down at the bottom of the league, it was a huge win for Doncaster against another team who have dropped off in AFC Wimbledon.\n\n\"The Dons shot themselves in the foot with a late red card and then conceding in the ninth minute of time added on. That is a hammer blow for Johnnie Jackson.\n\n\"For Doncaster it was a desperately needed win. When you go into a new year you are looking for that spark and that result today could give them that.\n\n\"It is the best way to win. There is no better feeling than a late win away from home. They need to bottle that and take it into the remaining games.\"\n\nIn League Two, Shrewsbury claimed a vital win against 10-man Harrogate to move four points clear of the bottom two.\n\nMcLean: \"Down at the bottom of League Two it was massive result for Shrewsbury.\n\n\"When you are down the wrong end of a division you have got to beat the teams around you.\n\n\"For Harrogate it's now 16 games without a win. Simon Weaver will be feeling the pressure and this will have been a game they'd have been looking at and thinking a result there today could have given them a major boost.\n\n\"The only team below them in the league Newport also took a really tough loss that I think just sums up their season.\n\n\"To concede in the 91st minute and the 99th minute, having taken the lead at Gillingham in the 84th minute... That shows boss Christian Fuchs the size of the job he has got.\n\n\"I think they're going to struggle to stay up but they're still within a shout because the teams above them aren't winning games either.\"\n\nAaron McLean was talking to BBC Sport England's Ian Woodcock.",

We always talk about the energy we need. It's related to how you defend, some moments, some duels and some situations, but also with the ball.\n\n\"It's my 27th derby. I came here many times and [today] we were not at the required level to win this type of game.\n\n\"We try. We talk about that but we had that energy four days ago at Newcastle.

We've talked to all interested parties, we're covering all areas and all opportunities.\"\n\nSilver also confirmed that he has spoken to Real Madrid, Barcelona and Paris St-Germain as he looks to mix established European teams with new ones.\n\nHowever, reports say the existing EuroLeague - which features Real and Barcelona - has concerns about the new venture, threatening legal action against the NBA should clubs break existing agreements to take part in the new competition.\n\nBut Silver, speaking before the NBA's first regular season match in London since 2019 on Sunday, feels the already existing strong support of football clubs could play a major role in growing the game across Europe.\n\n\"I want to be careful [of] those traditions,\" he said.\n\n\"That culture is so special, so unique, so long held, I don't want to fool myself or anybody else potentially involved in this new league that they can be easily transferred.\n\n\"At the same time, we want the benefits of that incredible wisdom and knowledge obtained over decades of operation.\n\n\"As an American, I see that religious fervour around people's football clubs here, and we could only be so lucky to tap into that. It's more singularly focused here. To me, that represents opportunity.\n\n\"We don't come into the market thinking we're going to take from football. What we see is a large opportunity and entertainment ecosystem, and we're seeing that all over the world that people are turning to premium live sports.\"",

    "fullText": "Thomas Frank's future may lie in the hands of those in power at Tottenham Hotspur, but the court of public opinion has delivered its damning final verdict.\n\nThe Dane has been the target for toxicity before as he fails dismally to win over Spurs supporters unconvinced by his pedigree after arriving from Brentford, along with a stodgy style regarded as conservative and dull.\n\nNot like this, though. Not on the levels of fury aimed at Frank at the dramatic conclusion of the 2-1 home defeat by struggling West Ham United.\n\nFrank looked a hapless, beaten figure as he offered polite applause to those who turned on him savagely after Callum Wilson bundled home a stoppage-time winner - the cue for a storm of discontent to be unleashed in his direction.\n\nSpurs fans were chanting \"sacked in the morning\" at their own manager even during the video assistant referee check for offside that eventually cleared Wilson's winner.\n\nSeconds later, when the final whistle confirmed the latest blow inflicted on Frank, it felt like there was no way back. This was the sound of a fanbase who had given up on their head coach, who no longer wanted him at the club.\n\nBrutal - but this was the inescapable conclusion. Frank was stunned, appearing broken as the pressure increasingly grows on his position.\n\nFormer Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney, told BBC Match of the Day: \"I felt for him - I have been in that position. It is a lonely position to be in. The Tottenham fans have spoken and, when that happens, it looks like he will lose his job.\"\n\nEx-England striker Alan Shearer, added: \"The players are not giving enough, there is no doubt but I don't see a plan or a system and some players are looking lost.\n\n\"When you look at some of their signings in the summer, I am thinking you have to give something extra. He knows the rules though, if you don't win games you are going to get sacked. He looked a very tired man by the end.\"",

    "fullText": "John Higgins stunned world number one Judd Trump as he fought back from 3-0 and 5-3 down to win 6-5 and reach his first Masters final since 2021.\n\nThe Scot will now face Kyren Wilson in Sunday's best-of-19 showpiece match beginning at 13:00 GMT, after he defeated Chinese debutant Wu Yize 6-5 in another thrilling last-four encounter.\n\nHiggins had lost his previous seven matches against Trump and appeared to be toiling as he made a series of errors in the opening three frames.\n\nHowever, Trump, whose highest break until that point was just 60, failed to convert two good opportunities to take the fourth frame which provided Higgins with a route back into the contest.\n\n\"He should maybe have been 4-0 in front and I maybe made it too easy for him,\" Higgins, who won the second of his two Masters titles 20 years ago, told BBC Sport.\n\n\"The fourth frame was massive because if he goes 4-0 it's done, but at 3-1 I felt good.\"\n\n\"People will laugh but I think I'm a better player now than I've ever been. You play these great champions like Judd and I am so proud because I've lost the last few against him.\"\n\nWith the momentum shifting, Higgins, 50, also took the fifth with a superb 104 break.\n\nThe Englishman pinched the sixth and eighth frames with half centuries after his opponent missed reds, but Higgins made a 57 clearance in similar fashion to take frame seven.\n\nTrump, 36, who has generally held sway in meetings between the pair since triumphing in their 2019 world final, looked set to seal victory in the ninth frame but with just four balls to pot, remarkably missed a routine brown.\n\nAnd that gave Higgins the impetus to craft pressure-breaks of 70 and 57 on his way to reeling off three tense frames in a row to complete a remarkable turnaround and become the oldest player to reach the final of a Triple Crown event.",

    "description": "Arne Slot responds after Liverpool are booed by sections of their home support in the 1-1 draw with Burnley at Anfield on Saturday.",
    "fullText": "Not for the first time this season, the full-time whistle at Anfield was met with boos from sections of the home support.\n\nFor the first time since the 1980-81 top-flight season, Liverpool had failed to win any of their three home league games against newly promoted sides.\n\nArne Slot's side drew 1-1 against Sunderland last month before drawing 0-0 against Leeds on New Year's Day. Saturday's 1-1 draw against Burnley completed the set.\n\nAsked about the boos, Slot said: \"In my head it wasn't booing but in my head it was frustration as well. If you, as Liverpool, are not disappointed by having a draw at home to Burnley then something is completely wrong.\n\n\"I completely understand the frustration. I have the same frustrations and the players definitely have the same frustrations as the fans.\"\n\nIn fairness, Slot's side did more than enough to win here against a Burnley side that scored from their only attempt on target.\n\nThe statistics alone told the story. Liverpool had 76 touches in the opposition box, 32 shots, 11 attempts on target and an xG of 2.95.\n\nOnly three times since records began have Liverpool taken more shots in a Premier League game without winning.\n\n\"I agree that we should have won this game,\" Slot told Match of the Day. \"There wasn't a lot more I could ask in terms of chance creation. We have a lot of ball possession but I would love us to create more.\n\n\"If we play a bit more open you always wonder if the other team can counter-attack you more, which you couldn't. I don't know how many moments we had but we could only score one.\"",
