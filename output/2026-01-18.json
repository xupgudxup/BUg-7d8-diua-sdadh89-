    "description": "Aprilia's Rivola is aware that retaining Bezzecchi and Martin in 2027 won’t be easy",
    "fullText": "Aprilia has admitted that it may be forced into early contract talks with Jorge Martin and Marco Bezzecchi, with rival teams “offering a lot of money” to lure its MotoGP riders away.\n\nWhile Aprilia’s improved competitiveness has made it an increasingly attractive destination within the paddock, the market value of Bezzecchi and Martin has also risen sharply in recent years, intensifying interest from other manufacturers.\n\nBezzecchi ended 2025 on a high with back-to-back victories in Portugal and Valencia, establishing himself as one of Marc Marquez’s closest challengers heading into the new season.\n\nMartin, meanwhile, had already attempted to activate a performance clause in his contract to leave Aprilia after 2025, with it widely believed that he had an offer to join Honda for this year.\n\nAprilia’s contracts with both riders expire at the end of 2026, in line with much of the MotoGP grid, which remains tied into the current two-year cycle.\n\nWith new technical regulations looming in 2027, the rider market is moving at a rapid pace, as teams seek to secure their line-ups before the start of the season.\n\nAprilia Racing CEO Massimo Rivola admitted he would prefer to delay decisions over his 2027 line-up, but acknowledged that growing interest from rival teams may leave him with little choice.\n\n“Honestly, I would prefer not to do it [sign riders] quickly, but maybe I am forced to do it quickly because the others are moving quite fast. I know that they are offering a lot of money to our riders,” Rivola said at Aprilia’s launch event.\n\n“But at the end, it is a commitment that we need to have altogether.\n\n“Clearly with Marco, we started building something that could allow me to see who he is.\n\n“With Jorge, we didn't start yet. I would love to see him 100% physically, and he is far from being that. He is a world champion. So it would be really nice to see him with us in the future. But first we need to give him his time.”\n\nLast year, Bezzecchi secured a factory contract for the first time in his career, as he joined Aprilia after three seasons at Ducati’s satellite VR46 team.\n\nWhile the Italian had already underlined his potential during a brilliant 2023 campaign in which he finished third in the standings, 2025 provided the clearest indication that he was ready for a championship assault with a factory.\n\nHe also emerged as Aprilia’s reference rider during the season, stepping into a leadership role after Martin missed much of the year due to a spate of injuries.\n\nAhead of the 2026 campaign, the 27-year-old said his priority is to secure the best possible package on the grid as he pursues his maiden title in grand prix racing.\n\nAsked whether winning or financial factors carried greater weight in his contract considerations, Bezzecchi said: “It always depends on who you are, it depends on what your priorities are.\n\n“Ultimately, if you want to earn a lot of money and you have people working with you to give you what you want, your manager and the people who work for you will do what's best for you.\n\n“If the best thing for you is to earn a lot of money, they'll do their best to make you earn a lot of money. If you want the best bike and you're willing to give up everything to try to have the best bike and to try to win, your manager must do what you want to try to make you feel better.\n\n“But it's clear that when you win anyway, you already earn well. I think that now, nowadays, all the riders in MotoGP are there to try to win, and so everyone tries to do their best.\n\n“Then, of course, if you're in a good moment and you take advantage of it, you earn even more, like in everything. But I don't think that's the focus. At least for me, personally, that's not the goal of my life.\n\n“Mine is to try to do the best I can with the bikes, to fight to win, also because if I win I'll also become rich. I'm even lucky twice over.”\n\nJorge Martin: Aprilia signed me to win the title, \"so I will fight till the end\"\n\nMax Biaggi: Aprilia 'not scared by any track' after late 2025 MotoGP charge\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "Paddy Pimblett has explained why his determination to fight Ilia Topuria soon is linked to Islam Makhachev.\n\nPaddy Pimblett’s rise through the UFC ranks has been steady, and his sights are now set on Ilia Topuria — not just to settle an old score, but because he sees it as a step toward a bigger goal.\n\nFor Pimblett, the path forward is shaped by the dominance of Islam Makhachev, a fighter he openly admires.\n\nIn a recent interview with The Mac Life, Paddy Pimblett was clear about who he sees as the sport’s top fighter, ahead of his bout with Justin Gaethje at UFC 324.\n\nHe praised Islam Makhachev’s dominance and consistency as the standard he aims to match in his own career.\n\n“For me, Islam is pound-for-pound No. 1. Ilia is No. 2. I want to beat Ilia and be on that pound-for-pound list. I want to show everyone why we have weight divisions and that he’s just too small to beat me.”\n\nThe Liverpool lightweight believes that beating Topuria would do more than just end their long-standing feud. It would also highlight the importance of weight classes in mixed martial arts, something he feels is often overlooked.\n\nPimblett’s recent comments show how much Makhachev’s reign has influenced his approach to the next stage of his career.\n\nPaddy Pimblett and Ilia Topuria’s rivalry began with a backstage confrontation at UFC London in 2022.\n\nSince then, both fighters have remained unbeaten in the UFC, and fans have been waiting for the matchup to finally take place.\n\nPimblett sees Topuria as the logical next step before facing higher-ranked opponents. He believes a victory would not only close a personal chapter but also mark his arrival among the elite — a journey that mirrors Makhachev’s rise to champion status.\n\nWith both men undefeated, anticipation continues to build for one of the UFC’s most heated potential matchups.\n\nFor Pimblett, though, it’s about more than rivalry — it’s about proving he can reach the level of the fighter he considers the sport’s best: Islam Makhachev.",

    "fullText": "The Miami Hurricanes have stormed their way to the College Football Playoff National Championship Game, riding a seven-game winning streak into a marquee matchup against the No. 1-ranked Indiana Hoosiers.\n\nBut with \"The U\" listed as nearly double-digit underdogs, they’ll need big performances from their playmakers to pull off the upset. With that in mind, here are my favorite Miami anytime touchdown picks for Monday, January 19.\n\nFor even more college football picks ahead of kickoff, check out my full Miami vs. Indiana predictions!\n\nMalachi Toney is one of the most electric players in this National Championship Game. While Indiana boasts an elite, disciplined defense, Toney has the game-breaking ability to make defenders miss and turn opportunities into scores.\n\nMiami has made a concerted effort to get its dynamic playmaker the ball in a variety of ways down the stretch. He’s been targeted 59 times, hauling in 45 catches, six for touchdowns, and has scored in five of his last six games.\n\nHurricanes tight end Elijah Lofton has already been ruled out for this game, so if Carson Beck needs a big-bodied security blanket, wideout CJ Daniels is the likely option.\n\nDaniels was one of Beck’s favorite targets earlier in the season, totaling 33 catches for 351 yards and six touchdowns over Miami’s first seven games.\n\nWhile Daniels hasn’t scored in the playoffs yet, he’s been targeted 16 times across three CFP games.\n\nAlthough Mark Fletcher Jr. is Miami’s lead running back, having CharMar Brown behind him makes the Hurricanes’ run game even more dangerous.\n\nBrown was last year’s FCS Freshman of the Year with National Champion North Dakota State, and the sophomore has earned Miami’s trust in key spots late in the season. Over his last five games, he’s totaled 37 carries for 150 yards and four touchdowns.\n\nIf “The U” needs to punch one in against a stout Indiana defense, Brown could get the call, making his +290 anytime TD odds enticing.\n\nMake your CFB National Championship Bets bets at FanDuel, America's No. 1 sportsbook! \n\nOdds are correct at the time of publishing and are subject to change.\nNot intended for use in MA.\nAffiliate Disclosure: Our team of experts has thoroughly researched and handpicked each product that appears on our website.

    "fullText": "The total on the College Football Playoff national championship may be as low as 47.5, but only a fool would think the Indiana Hoosiers will not score multiple touchdowns.\n\nAs brilliantly as the Miami Hurricanes’ defense has played in three Playoff games, some things are just inevitable.\n\nMy Indiana anytime touchdown picks focus on a couple of long shots for Monday, January 19.\n\nFor even more college football picks ahead of kickoff, check out our full Miami vs. Indiana predictions!\n\nIndiana’s WR1 Elijah Sarratt tweaked his hamstring at the start of November, causing him to miss three games and clearly limiting him for three more before breaking out in the Playoff semifinal.\n\nOne of those limited games came against Ohio State in the Big Ten title game, the nation’s best passing defense — an ugly 13-10 Hoosiers’ win. With Sarratt limited, Omar Cooper Jr. stepped up and has continued to contribute even after Sarratt returned.\n\nCooper has scored a touchdown in each of those six games.\n\nOf Fernando Mendoza’s six rushing touchdowns in six different games this season, only one came in a close contest, finding the end zone at Penn State in a 27-24 win.\n\nHowever, that rate alone justifies this bet: In Indiana’s three close games, Mendoza scored in one.\n\nThe real thought process here is simply an acknowledgement that there is no reason not to use every wrinkle possible in the national championship game.\n\nThere is a reason the “Philly Special” is used most often in massive games. These are the moments such plays are saved for.\n\nBut more likely, Mendoza carrying the ball near the goal line could help the Hoosiers mitigate Miami's defensive front.\n\nThis bet would have cashed on the first snap of the Playoff semifinal. Imagine that joy.\n\nIndiana has snagged 18 interceptions this season. As much as Miami quarterback Carson Beck could be the engine behind the Hurricanes winning the national championship, he could also propel the Hoosiers to the title.\n\nBeck threw four interceptions in a Friday game against Louisville back in October.

    "description": "The United Shore Professional Baseball League (USPBL), an independent league based in Michigan, is recruiting players in order to \"build the ability to pitch deep into games.\" Can it be done?",
    "fullText": "The independent minor leagues are baseball’s laboratories.\n\nPitch clocks? The robot umpires coming to the major leagues this year? The home run derby used to settle ties, as seen in last year’s All-Star Game? All first tested in an independent league.\n\nSome concepts are hits. Some are flops.\n\nThe experiment to watch this year is almost spiritual in nature: Can professional baseball make starting pitching great again?\n\nBaseball’s obsession with velocity has dampened the soul of the sport. The marquee pitching matchup is an endangered species. The oohs and aahs over a 100-mph pitch have been replaced by yawns.\n\nThe potential solution, or at least a piece of one, is evident in this job description:\n\nThe United Shore Professional Baseball League (USPBL), an independent league based in Michigan, is recruiting for the position of “primary starting pitcher.”\n\nThe game isn’t building traditional starters anymore. At the @uspbl, were changing that.\n\nWe are actively recruiting Primary Starting Pitchers who want to take the ball every week, pitch deep into games, and become the durable, innings-capable arms MLB organizations need.\n\nThis… pic.twitter.com/0JZvXEFsqW\n\n— Justin Orenduff (@JustinOrenduff) December 1, 2025\n\nThe language is intentional. In today’s major leagues, a starting pitcher generally is selected, trained and deployed to throw as hard as he can for as long as he can. Five innings is perfectly acceptable, with a parade of harder-throwing reinforcements in the bullpen.\n\nWhat the USPBL plans for a primary starting pitcher: “Build the ability to pitch deep into games.”\n\nThat used to be self-evident for a starting pitcher, but no longer. Yoshinobu Yamamoto turned into Sandy Koufax last October, with back-to-back complete games during the Dodgers’ championship run.\n\nHowever, in the regular season, the Dodgers did not throw a complete game, and neither did 12 other teams. The Dodgers’ starters averaged 4.85 innings per game; no team averaged even six innings.\n\nIn 2025, three major league pitchers threw 200 innings. In 2010, 45 did.\n\n“Being able to get more Mark Buehrles or Cliff Lees back into the fold would be good for the game,” said Justin Orenduff, a 2004 Dodgers first-round draft pick and now the USPBL executive director of baseball strategy and development.\n\nBuehrle, a five-time All-Star, and Lee, a four-time All-Star, each featured precision rather than power.\n\nLee, twice a Game 1 World Series starter, did not average 92 mph on his fastball but pitched 200 innings eight times. Buerhle, whose average fastball did not top 90 mph, pitched 200 innings for 14 consecutive years.\n\nNeither might be drafted today. Major league teams crave velocity, and young pitchers train to boost it. The number of players throwing at least 95 mph at the Perfect Game national showcase increased sevenfold from 2014 to 2024, according to a report from Major League Baseball.\n\nThe average MLB fastball rose from 91 mph in 2008 to 94 mph in 2024, the report said.\n\n“Velocity is the No. 1 predictor of success,” Billy Eppler, then the Angels’ general manager, told me in 2018.\n\nVelocity also is associated with an increased risk of injury. Teams have implemented well-intentioned measures — pitch counts, innings limits, more rest between appearances — that have not mitigated the risks and might well have led to more injuries.\n\nKyle Boddy, the founder of Driveline, the seminal program for velocity training, said a hard-throwing pitcher is not going to manage his velocity on an inflexible pitch count.\n\n“If he goes 60 or 70 pitches, he’s going to sit 100,” Boddy told Baseball America. “He’s not stupid. And if we tell him, ‘There’s no limits on you,’ but we keep taking him out after 70 pitches every time, he’s going to realize what’s going on.\n\n“If he can’t control the volume, the one lever he can control is the intensity. I personally think that’s worse for his arm, going max effort for shorter stints.”\n\nThat ultimately works against developing starting pitchers capable of delivering six innings, the MLB report said.\n\n“Modern workload management strategies — ostensibly intended to prevent overuse, protect pitcher health, and maximize pitcher effectiveness — may actually increase injury risk by allowing and even incentivizing pitchers to throw with maximum effort on every pitch,” the report said, “rather than requiring pitchers to conserve energy and pace themselves in an effort to pitch through longer outings.”\n\nNot only does throwing harder increase the risk of injury, the MLB report said, but the resulting parade of strikeouts runs “counter to contact-oriented approaches that create more balls in play and result in the type of on-field action that fans want to see.”\n\nIn the independent Atlantic League, the league has run several years of testing on a “double hook” rule: when a team removes its starting pitcher, it loses its designated hitter. That would incentivize a major league team to use its starter for six or seven innings instead of four or five, but it would not solve the underlying problem: What if the starting pitcher cannot work six or seven innings?\n\nThat is where Orenduff and the USPBL come in.\n\nEvery general manager says he would love a rotation of five 200-inning starters, if only he could find them. They cannot offer on-the-job training in the majors, lest their team find itself at a competitive disadvantage.\n\nIn an independent league, Orenduff need not worry about that. Tough matchup with the bases loaded in the fourth inning? Third time through the order in the sixth inning? Pitch through it.\n\n“It’s not going to be that quick pull,” he said.\n\nThis is not about leaving a starting pitcher out there to get crushed just to pitch through it. This is about shaking off the shackles of those one-size-fits-all limitations.\n\n“You basically want to start by showing fans and the industry, for example, that 100 pitches is just a number,” he said. “It’s completely arbitrary.\n\n“Some guys may be able to go 110, 120. We want to be able to show that the game can still produce players that are successful on the mound, most importantly, but are capable of going beyond the fifth inning and beyond 100 pitches if the expectation and the leadership and the structure are there to support it.”\n\nThe USPBL will have pretty much the same technology as major league teams do, to measure spin rates and recovery rates and every other rate. If you can maintain command and velocity, if you can get outs without max effort on every pitch, and if you can bounce back between innings and between starts, you may be able to be that primary starting pitcher.\n\nFrankly, Orenduff says, all the velocity in the world cannot help your team if you cannot pitch.\n\n“That has to be a metric too: sustainability and availability,” he said.\n\nHe conducted a study evaluating each team’s top three pitching draft picks since 2013. With the caveats that some pitchers were traded and some prospects still are developing, Orenduff found that three in four of those top drafted pitchers never have pitched for the major league team that drafted them, at a combined cost to the 30 MLB teams of $800 million in signing bonuses.\n\n“We just have to have some sort of proof we can help more players have longer careers by being a little more flexible in how we frame things for them,” Orenduff said.\n\nHere’s hoping the USPBL can discover some training methods that major league teams can use. Better that than listening to a major league manager with a 13-man pitching staff say after a game that he ran out of pitchers, as we too often hear. Can you imagine what Tommy Lasorda would have to say about that?\n\n Delivered at the start of each series.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

Evidently, today, it was meant to go that way.”\n\nJuventus dominated possession and arguably had the best chances to score at the Unipol Domus last night, but the home side managed a win with an xG of 0.16 compared to Juve’s 1.28.\n\nCAGLIARI, ITALY – JANUARY 17: Luciano Spalletti coach of Juventus reacts during the Serie A match between Cagliari Calcio and Juventus FC at Stadio Sant’Elia on January 17, 2026 in Cagliari, Italy. (Photo by Enrico Locci/Getty Images)\n\n“I congratulate Cagliari, their fans and their president. Now we focus on the next match,” Spalletti added.\n\n“Surely, we must work on excessive time-wasting, which breaks up the flow of the game too much.”\n\nJuventus’ next game is at home against José Mourinho’s Benfica in the Champions League next Wednesday. Their following league game is also at home, against Antonio Conte’s Napoli on Sunday, January 25.\n\nSpalletti has won ten of his 16 matches in charge of Juventus, drawing four times and losing twice.",

    "fullText": "Lisandro Martinez has told Paul Scholes to come to his house and be honest with him if he wants to criticise him.\n\nThe World Cup winner hit back at the former Manchester United midfielders Scholes and Nicky Butt by accusing them of saying one thing to his face and another behind his back.\n\nMartinez excelled in Saturday’s Manchester derby win, keeping Erling Haaland, who is 20cm taller, quiet as United won 2-0 in Michael Carrick’s first game in charge.\n\nBut in the build-up, the 1999 Champions League winners spoke on a podcast when Butt said: “Haaland would pick Martinez up and run with him. It’ll be like you know when you see a dad after school running down the road with a little toddler.” Then Scholes replied: “He’d score, then throw him in the net.”\n\nBut Martinez feels they are guilty of double standards, saying: “I told him already, if he wants to say something to me, he can come to wherever he wants. To my house, wherever. I don't care.\n\n“And I respect the relations when they want to help the club because everyone can talk on the television but when you see [them] here face to face, no one says anything in your face. So for me, I don't really care what they say.”\n\nMartinez said he was not motivated by their comments, adding: “It doesn't give me anything. My motivation is my family.”\n\nBut the defender praised a third ex-United midfielder, in Carrick, for changing the mentality in the team after Ruben Amorim’s sacking.\n\n“So different, so different,” he added. “Different mentality, different guy. He knows what this club really means. He sent us the message that he played here for a long, long time. He won everything. He is a big legend. He wants to help the club and I think we were in a tough situation and today was the best moment to change that.”\n\nMartinez was paired in the middle of the defence with Harry Maguire as Carrick played a back four. They kept just United’s third clean sheet of the season and Martinez said the double act talked together to keep them organised.\n\n“I've known him for a long time and we speak a lot,” he said. “Today we had really good communication on the pitch but not just only with 'H'.”",

    "fullText": "The Africa Cup of Nations reaches its climax on Sunday with a showdown between host nation Morocco, looking to win the title for the first time in 50 years, and Sadio Mane's powerful Senegal side.\n\nThe final kicks off at 1900 GMT at the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium in Rabat, where almost all the 69,000 spectators will be backing Morocco, captained by African player of the year Achraf Hakimi.\n\nThe first AFCON ever to start in one year and end in another could be the second in a row to be won by the host nation, with the Atlas Lions aiming to follow in the footsteps of Ivory Coast, crowned champions on home soil in 2024.\n\nWalid Regragui's Morocco have established themselves in recent years as Africa's pre-eminent national team, becoming the first from the continent to reach a World Cup semi-final, in 2022, and climbing to 11th place in the world rankings.\n\nHowever, they have long been AFCON underachievers, with their only title to date coming in 1976. This will be their first final since 2004, when they lost to Tunisia when Regragui was part of the team.\n\nSenegal, meanwhile, are appearing in their third final in four editions and are targeting a second title to follow their 2022 triumph, when Mane scored the decisive shoot-out penalty against Egypt in Yaounde.\n\n\"We dreamt of being here and now we have done it,\" Regragui told reporters on Saturday.\n\nHe has been under suffocating pressure to deliver the title for the football-mad nation, and would possibly not have kept his job through to the approaching World Cup in North America had he not reached the final.\n\n\"I hope this is just the beginning and not our last AFCON final,\" he added.\n\n\"Big football nations want to be up there on a regular basis. Tomorrow we want to try to make history.\"\n\nHe added: \"Senegal will need to be really strong to beat us at home, although they are capable.\"\n\nMorocco's success over the last four weeks has been based around the attacking threat of Real Madrid winger Brahim Diaz, the tournament's top scorer with five goals, and a defence which has conceded only once.\n\nBeing at home brings extra pressure, but can also be a huge advantage, and Senegal have complained about the conditions in which they were welcomed to Rabat ahead of the game.\n\nThe Lions of Teranga were based in the northern port city of Tangiers until they arrived in Rabat by train on Friday.\n\nThe Senegalese Football Federation complained about a \"lack of adequate security\" for the team's arrival amid a crowd of fans \"which put the players and staff at risk\".\n\nIt also complained about their hotel, the fact that their supporters were given fewer than 3,000 tickets for the final, and about being asked to train at the Moroccan team's base in nearby Sale.\n\n\"What happened was not normal,\" said Senegal coach Pape Thiaw.\n\n\"Given the number there, anything could have happened. My players could have been in danger.\n\n\"That type of thing should not happen between two brother countries.\"\n\nMane, a two-time winner of the African player of the year award, said after netting the winner in the semi-final against Egypt that Sunday's game would be his last ever AFCON appearance.\n\nBut Thiaw insisted on the eve of the game that the former Liverpool forward may have to rethink that decision.\n\n\"I think he made his decision in the heat of the moment and the country does not agree, and I as coach of the national team do not agree,\" said Thiaw.\n\n\"We would like to keep him for as long as possible,\" added the coach, who is without centre-back and captain Kalidou Koulibaly due to suspension.\n\nOff the pitch this edition of Africa's premier sports event has demonstrated that Morocco is determined to be a successful co-host of the 2030 World Cup.\n\nThe tournament has been free of the problems that have plagued earlier AFCONs, the stadiums and pitches have generally been of a high quality and high-speed rail links show a country significantly upgrading its infrastructure.",

The England defender will now join City on a bumper contract for a fee of around £20m - leaving Liverpool empty-handed.\n\nPlans will now need to be made for an alternative defender to come to Anfield - and it’s unlikely to happen in January. But next summer the picture will change and the Merseysiders will need to recruit a solid, senior option in the position.\n\nAnd according to a report in TEAMtalk one Liverpool target Alessandro Bastoni is willing to move.\n\nThe Inter Milan defender, 26, is under contract at San Siro until 2028 and it’s speculated that a fee of around £70m would be required to sign the Italy international.\n\n“Alessandro Bastoni is very much open to a transfer this year,” the report reads.\n\nIt looks like Chelsea will also be in the market for Bastoni - a left-footed centre-back who can also play in a back three. Other players reported to be under consideration for a Liverpool role include Nico Schlotterbeck and Nathan Collins.\n\nBastoni has won two Serie A titles for the Nerazzurri since debuting in the 2019/20 season and has also helped his side reach two Champions League final. He was also a member of the Italy squad which won the 2020 UEFA European Championship at Wembley.",

This runs counter to the narrative many shareholders are using to argue that the stock market must not be in a bubble. They insist that, because the S&P 500’s SPX earnings per share are projected to grow at a well-above-average pace in 2026, a bear market is most unlikely.The current consensus expectation (according to Wall Street firm CFRA) is that the S&P 500’s EPS in 2026 will be 14.1% higher than 2025’s, double its 50-year annualized growth rate of 7.1%.

    "description": "As highlighted Friday in the New York Post, the proposed wealth tax would hit founders on their voting shares rather than the actual equity they own.",
    "fullText": "If you’ve been following the billionaire exodus from California with some confusion, here’s what’s actually driving the nervousness: it’s not the 5% rate. As highlighted Friday in the New York Post, the proposed wealth tax would hit founders on their voting shares rather than the actual equity they own.\n\nTake Larry Page, who about 3% of Google but controls roughly 30% of its voting power through dual-class stock. Under this proposal, he’d owe taxes on that 30%. For a company valued in the hundreds of billions, that’s a lot more than a rounding error. The Post reports that one SpaceX alumni founder building grid technology would face a tax bill at the Series B stage of the company that would wipe out his entire holdings.\n\nDavid Gamage, the University of Missouri law professor who helped craft the proposal, thinks Silicon Valley is overreacting. “I don’t understand why the billionaires just aren’t calling good tax lawyers,” he told The San Francisco Standard this week. Gamage insists founders wouldn’t be forced to sell. Those with most of their wealth in private stock could open a deferral account for assets they don’t want taxed immediately — California would instead take 5% whenever those shares are eventually sold. “If your startup fails, you pay nothing,” he explained. “But if your startup is the next Google, you’re giving California a share of your gamble.” He also said founders could submit alternative valuations from certified appraisers reflecting what shares could actually sell for, rather than being stuck with the default voting-control formula.\n\nBut that’s pretty small consolation. For startups that aren’t publicly traded, calculating valuations is “inherently difficult,” tax expert Jared Walczak told the Post. “These are not clear cut—you could come to a very different conclusion not because of dishonesty.” And if the state disagrees with your appraisal, it’s not just the company on the hook; the state can also penalize the person who calculated the valuation. Even with alternative appraisals, founders would still face enormous tax bills on control they hold but wealth they haven’t realized.\n\nNow, if you’ve been under a rock: California’s health care union is pushing a ballot initiative for a one-time 5% tax on anyone worth over $1 billion. The union argues it’s necessary to offset the deep cuts to health care that President Trump signed into law last year, including slashes to Medicaid and ACA subsidies. As originally envisioned, they expect to raise about $100 billion from roughly 200 individuals and the tax would apply retroactively to anyone living in California as of January 1, 2026.\n\nBut the resistance is fierce and bipartisan. As reported last weekend by the WSJ, Silicon Valley elite have formed a Signal chat called “Save California” that includes everyone from Trump’s crypto czar David Sacks to Kamala Harris mega-donor Chris Larsen. They’ve called the proposal “Communism” and “poorly defined.” Some are taking just-in-case measures, too, with Larry Page reportedly dropping $173.4 million on two Miami waterfront properties across last month and the first week of the new year, and Peter Thiel’s firm leasing Miami office space last month. (Thiel has had ties to Miami for years — including a home — but an uncharacteristic press release about the move was seemingly meant to send a message.)\n\nEven Governor Gavin Newsom is fighting it. “This will be defeated, there’s no question in my mind,” he told the New York Times this week, adding that he’d been “relentlessly working behind the scenes” against the proposal. “I’ll do what I have to do to protect the state.”\n\nFor now, the union isn’t backing down. “We’re simply trying to keep emergency rooms open and save patient lives,” said executive committee member Debru Carthan to the Journal last weekend. “The few who left have shown the world just how outrageously greedy they truly are.”\n\nThe proposal needs 875,000 signatures to make November’s ballot, where it would need a simple majority to pass.",

OpenAI also confirmed it will soon start testing ads in ChatGPT …\n\nOpenAI first launched ChatGPT Go in India last year and gradually rolled out it to 170 additional countries. Starting today, ChatGPT Go is available everywhere ChatGPT is available, including the United States.\n\nWith this, there are now three tiers of ChatGPT available:\n\nHere’s what you get with ChatGPT Go compared to the free plan:\n\nSecond, OpenAI says that it will “testing ads in the free tier and ChatGPT Go in the US soon.” ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise tiers will remain ad-free.\n\nOpenAI detailed its approach to ads in ChatGPT in a blog post published today:\n\nTo start, we plan to test ads at the bottom of answers in ChatGPT when there’s a relevant sponsored product or service based on your current conversation. Ads will be clearly labeled and separated from the organic answer. You’ll be able to learn more about why you’re seeing that ad, or dismiss any ad and tell us why. During our test, we will not show ads in accounts where the user tells us or we predict that they are under 18, and ads are not eligible to appear near sensitive or regulated topics like health, mental health or politics.\n\nFurthermore, OpenAI says that your conversations with ChatGPT are not shared with advertisers. Ads also will not influence answers that ChatGPT gives you.\n\nOpenAI says that it’s “not launching ads yet,” but rather plans to “start testing in the coming weeks for logged in adults in the U.S. on the free and Go tiers.”\n\nWhat do you think of today’s announcements from OpenAI?

    "fullText": "UK gas prices don't form in isolation - they're the result of a global system where LNG tankers move molecules across oceans, storage facilities buffer seasonal demand swings, and physical constraints create friction that simple supply-demand models miss.\n\nThis guide explains the infrastructure and economics that connect US shale production to UK power plants. You'll learn how LNG shipping works, why UK gas prices track Henry Hub (Louisiana) with a 6-8 week lag, and how traders calculate netback prices to decide whether exporting US gas to Europe is profitable. You'll see why LNG is the flexible marginal source while Norwegian pipelines provide inflexible baseload, and how charter rate volatility (which spiked 5x in 2025) can turn a profitable cargo into a loss overnight.\n\nThe guide also covers the UK's structural vulnerability: storage capacity below 2% of annual demand (versus 20% in continental Europe). You'll understand why this makes UK prices volatile, how storage arbitrage works (and why most seasonal spreads don't cover storage costs), and why NBP can decouple from TTF despite physical interconnection - a basis risk that's burned countless traders who assumed prices would converge.\n\nYou'll work through real calculations: shipping costs for Atlantic crossings, netback comparisons between European and Asian markets, and storage break-even analysis using German salt caverns. By the end, you'll see how global gas dynamics feed directly into the spark spread formulas you'll learn next.\n\nPhysical Foundations taught you why gas plants set marginal power prices. This guide shows you where gas prices come from - the global infrastructure that determines the fuel input cost. Next, you'll learn spark spreads (power minus gas minus carbon), which combine gas prices with power and carbon markets to identify profitable generation opportunities.\n\nComplete the Physical Foundations guide first. You need to understand merit order dispatch and why gas-fired plants are marginal price-setters. No prior trading experience required.\n\nTrack Henry Hub and NBP prices online or on TradingView for a month.

    "fullText": "The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, one of America’s oldest newspapers, announced this month that it would cease publication. The family-owned company that operates the paper made the announcement after a court ruled against it in a dispute with unionized workers. Pittsburgh is hardly alone. Since 2005, more than 3,500 newspapers have shuttered. On average, two close every week.\n\nThe consequences of the collapse of the local newspaper business have been severe. When communities lose their local news outlets, civic engagement drops, corruption rises, government waste increases and political polarization worsens. Communities no longer know themselves. No number of headlines about goings-on in Washington can change that.\n\nBut the death of The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette does not mean that Pittsburghers must go without local news. While the market failure of the newspaper business has been well documented, what is less known is how communities all over the country have responded to this crisis.\n\nHundreds of nonprofit local news organizations have sprung up, from Lafayette, La., to New Bedford, Mass., to Chicago. Rather than relying primarily on advertising revenue, nonprofit newsrooms are sustained by coalitions of philanthropic institutions, local businesses, individual donors and readers. Under this model, local journalism is treated as a public good, essential to civic life, akin to a museum or a food bank.\n\nMany of these nonprofits started within the past decade. They operate where audiences can be most easily found today: online and in email inboxes. There’s less focus on print and newsstands. This new generation of local nonprofit outlets — some of which are supported by the American Journalism Project, where I work — has already distinguished itself with journalism of the highest quality. In the past three years, the Pulitzer Prize for local reporting has been awarded entirely or jointly to a nonprofit newsroom that did not exist even a decade prior.\n\nThe excellent reporting by nonprofits includes the Pulitzer-winning work of Mississippi Today, founded in 2016, which exposed tens of millions of dollars in misused Mississippi state welfare money. The Indiana-based Mirror Indy uncovered systemic abuse at a mental health facility in Lawrence, Ind. In the run-up to the 2025 election, the Boyle Heights Beat in East Los Angeles reported a shortage of in-person polling centers; officials solved the problem as a result. The City, a nonprofit based in New York City, revealed allegedly corrupt practices within then-Mayor Eric Adams’s administration after a senior adviser attempted to give cash, memorably concealed in a bag of chips, to a reporter.\n\nThe success of these newsrooms suggests the problem facing local news is not a lack of public appetite but an outdated business model. The new approach is rapidly growing: The number of local nonprofit news outlets more than doubled from 2017 to 2022, according to the Institute for Nonprofit News. In Vermont, VTDigger boasts a monthly audience of 500,000 in a state with just over 600,000 people and now has an operating budget of $3 million, supported by reader donations, advertising and individual and institutional philanthropy alike. The Baltimore Banner brought in more than $13 million in revenue in 2024, with about half from subscriptions, a third from advertising and a fifth from donations.\n\nMany work with established media companies in partnerships that allow online-only nonprofit newsrooms to distribute some of their work in legacy newspapers. And some legacy newspapers, like The Salt Lake Tribune, have become nonprofits.\n\nThe value of independent local journalism is acknowledged across our deep partisan divide. Last year, both Republican and Democratic state lawmakers cited The Texas Tribune in the documentation and analysis behind 25 separate bills. After a recent Texas state legislative election, two competing candidates jointly voiced support for another nonprofit, The Fort Worth Report, writing, “While we disagree on many issues, we agree on this.”\n\nThus far, nonprofit start-ups have not expanded nearly enough to replace the full depth of coverage that vanishes when a newspaper closes. Some, like The Houston Landing, have also closed. Members of the Institute for Nonprofit News now employ over 3,000 journalists, well below the 45,000 reporting and editing jobs lost at newspapers since 2005. These gaps are not abstractions: Reporters are eyes and ears at school board meetings, city halls and statehouses, probing for wrongdoing and holding the powerful to account. The concrete value of that work does not go unnoticed; even today, Americans continue to express far higher levels of trust in local news reporting than in national media.\n\nThe collapse of the newspaper industry unfolded over decades. Rebuilding local journalism will take time, money and community support.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, there are particular reasons for optimism. The city has a robust philanthropic community with a track record of investing in institutions that anchor public life. The city has world-class museums, universities, libraries and hospitals. As The Post-Gazette has shrunk, nonprofits like Spotlight PA, Pittsburgh’s Public Source and the public radio station WESA have stepped in, as has the city’s other daily paper, The Tribune-Review. A chapter of the news-focused philanthropy group Press Forward was recently founded in the city, indicating recognition that the city has the ingredients needed to ensure local journalism still thrives.\n\nThe end of a venerable newspaper is disheartening. But it does not have to mean the end of local journalism — in Pittsburgh or anywhere else.\n\nSarabeth Berman is the chief executive of the American Journalism Project.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

    "fullText": "If you follow me, you might already know Tech Workers Coalition (TWC). For everybody else, TWC is an international organization that supports union and political organizing of workers within the tech sector. It's heavily decentralized and has chapters spread throughout North America and Europe. It includes every kind of profession in the field: developers, content moderators, designers, testers, sysadmins, data workers, customer service, and so on.\n\nThe organization, over the years, tried different paths to communicate to the outside what it does, why it does what it does, and what it would like to do in the future. The most recent iteration is probably this Identity Document, which gets regularly printed into flyers and handed to newcomers during onboarding sessions.\n\nThe challenge comes from different factors:\n\nI've been part of TWC for 7 years now. I helped start the Berlin chapter, then the Italian chapter, and in the last two years, the Global chapter. I've talked with hundreds of people participating in the communities, coached many chapter organizers, given workshops and onboarding sessions, and facilitated hundreds of meetings within TWC. It is now an integral part of my present and my past.\n\nIn this article, I want to give my take on why I do this, why I think it's important, and why some of you might want to join us. Because, ultimately, it is not so obvious and linear why somebody should be contributing their time to TWC rather than, for example, a union.\n\nLet me preface by saying that I strongly believe that any healthy political ecosystem is composed of organizations aware of their own role. Constructive relationships are also built by behaving in a way that fosters the success of your peers and the health of the whole ecology, rather than by exclusively pursuing the success of your own ideas, your own model, and your own issues. In the context of political participation and activation, this often translates into growing the organization with just the right people, rather than growing indefinitely. Trying to incorporate everybody and preventing them from joining organizations with slightly different values or goals turns political engagement into a zero-sum game. That means that we often invite workers NOT to join TWC if it's not the right thing for them, and rather do direct workplace organizing, join a union, or a party.\n\nThis article, then, while advocating for the merit and worth of participating in TWC, should be seen primarily as a useful tool to decide if you might be a good fit for TWC or if you should rather join a different space.\n\nSo, why Tech Workers Coalition? Why should you join? And how would your effort translate into impact?\n\nOne of the most recognized contributions of TWC has always been its ability to complement unions at the local level. Often stuck in a Fordist mindset, unions struggle to grasp the implications of cognitive labor and its specificities, worsening the gap of language, culture, and aesthetics between unions and office workers in the tech sector.\n\nThis doesn't happen magically: TWC organizers create offline and online community spaces, conferences, and events for green and experienced tech organizers to connect. They develop relationships with unions and link them to workplaces that are interested in organizing. They translate in both directions and facilitate interactions. They offer educational activities specific to labor organizing in the tech sector that unions overlook.\n\nUnions are often big organizations, slow to adapt and transform. Cognitive work poses deep challenges that are still unsolved at a global strategic level. TWC allows tech unions to still develop and thrive on the ground by filling the gaps in the areas traditional unions cannot yet see.\n\nThe more we go on, the more we realize how the tech elites, especially in the USA, are openly supporting a return to Fascism and other forms of oppression. They are reshaping the global economy to entrench themselves in the productive processes and state machinery. They imprint their values and beliefs on the psychic landscape of the ever-increasingly alienated modern and post-modern worlds.\n\nMany are fighting the tech oligarchs from without: hackers and FOSS communities, environmental activists, NGOs, and sometimes even governments. The truth is, though, that the real leverage is between the office chair and the keyboard. We could talk extensively about economics, infrastructure, power analysis, and even draw historical comparisons with the organizing of early factory workers, when only a few, like Marx, were advocating for focusing on them rather than organizing farmers, like most socialists were doing. It would be a long and boring analysis. Suffice to say that there's a lot of power in the tech industry, and that's a lot of power that could be contested and won by tech workers. We are uniquely positioned to bind such power enough to, at the very least, limit the harm the tech industry is doing to the rest of the world or, in the best scenario, reshape how and why technology is produced.\n\nWhat if you believe this, but you don't work in tech? Well, join TWC anyway. Workplace organizing is not possible for everybody: geography, workplace conditions, or, as I said, a different career path might prevent you from doing “the Thing”. TWC is a space where you can help others do “the Thing”. It's meta-organizing, baby. For some, it is frustrating: they want to be directly involved, they want the tension of a high-stakes union election, or the thrill and risk of a direct action during a protest. For others, it is cozy and reassuring: you help a hundred plants grow, and some of them for sure will bear fruit.\n\nThe tech labor movement is, worldwide, a relatively young phenomenon. In some countries, it's unheard of. In some others, it is growing and exploring what's possible. While we are beginning to understand what works and what doesn't, nobody really has found a magic formula that solves it all. Contrary to other forms of labor organizing, where ideas decades old are crystallized and organizations struggle to keep up with social and political changes, in the tech sector there's a lot of experimentation going on.\n\nOn one side it is stressful for many: some workers just want to improve their workplace and would like to have a cookiecutter strategy to apply. On the other side, for the more creative and ambitious, there's a lot of room to try new approaches. For example, we are still not set on what a strike in tech looks like. Some workers just stop working. Some employ traditional forms like picketing or marching instead of going to the office. Some others do more fun and creative stuff to keep busy and attract attention: live streaming, union-themed game jams and hackathons, and so on and so forth.\n\nTWC acts as a network throuch which these ideas travel. Traditional media or social media don't always cover these topics, especially outside the USA. Established networks of unions often talk high-level strategy and rarely go into such level of detail. TWC instead often sees meetings with tech workers from all over, sharing their stories and circulating know-how they didn't know they had. In a way, being in TWC feels like the early internet: tech labor is fragmented and disconnected across national boundaries, and absent from traditional media. TWC acts as a network for the first time, allowing tech workers to discover that in Czechia, India, or the Philippines, there are people like them, with similar issues, but maybe completely different approaches, ideas, and aesthetics.\n\nAs we said, the fight against Big Tech takes many shapes. TWC doesn't collaborate only with labor organizations, but, especially at a local level, acts as an aggregator for people working professionally on the political side of technology: researchers, investigators, artists, occultists, cooperative entrepreneurs, sometimes even party politicians.\n\nThis means that many members of TWC get involved in a lot of different and interesting initiatives happening at the fringes of our network: experimental commoning of technology, litigations, hackatons, policy-making, campaigns, performances, exhibitions, and so on.\n\nIn many places, especially smaller cities, TWC becomes a beacon for anybody working with radical technology but dissatisfied with the more traditional aggregation around hackerspaces or technical communities.\n\nFor some of us, this turned into a whole new career. Workplace organizing is fundamental, but after you're done, after you have your union in place, the company will probably still be working on how to feed the souls of innocent babies into a spirit-grinding, high-performance, demonic contraption. It takes a long time before the union is strong enough to push the company away from the business of butchering baby souls and towards more useful endeavors.\n\nThere are many cases of members that, after several years of TWC, decide to abandon their career in the tech startup or corporate world and go do something different. Some get employed by unions. Some start their own cooperative with their friends. Others join TWC meetings after waking up early to work on a farm. Some go teach in a movement school or join an NGO. Personally, participating in TWC allowed me to connect with people who eventually got me involved into AI Forensics first, and Reversing.works later. The full story here.\n\nI hope this article gave a compelling overview of what I helped build through a whole fifth of my life and I will keep building going forward. A journey that thought me agency, compassion, patience, dedication, and especially the ecstactic joy of seeing the world and the life of people around you change and get better over time.\n\nIf you're tired of arguing on the internet, if you think there's nothing to be done to form a union at work, if you're forced to “monitor the situation”, join TWC.",

    "description": "Building a TUI to index and search coding agent sessions across Claude Code, Codex, and others, with Tantivy for fuzzy full-text search.",
    "fullText": "This is the story of how fast-resume came to life and evolved, as I was trying to search and resume my coding agent sessions more easily across different local CLI agents.\n\nI use many coding agents these days: Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Copilot, and more. Sometimes I remember that I, or the agent, mentioned something specific in a previous session, and I want to go back to it.\n\nMost coding agents have a /resume feature now, which allows a session to be reopened with all the state back. While the resume feature works great, finding which session to resume is harder.\n\nThat means that for example if I remember the agent mentioning a specific subject later during the conversation, it won’t be in the title, so I can’t find it.\n\nLet’s say I have a few sessions about building a TUI program. I remember that in one of the sessions, the agent mentioned textual. I can’t search for textual in the resume view! Also, if I don’t remember the folder and which agent I used, I’m screwed. And some agents don’t have that feature at all.\n\nSo I started ripgrep‘ing my home folder to find the string I was searching for, then using clues from the session file (directory, timestamp, context) to navigate to the correct directory, /resume, and find the session in question. 😅\n\nSince most coding agents store sessions locally, I started thinking: what if I could automate this grep‘ing, wrap it in a nice TUI and be able to resume in one keypress?\n\nFirst, to see if this was feasible, I had to understand how sessions are actually stored. Most agents use JSON files, but there are some interesting differences.\n\nMost agents follow the same pattern as Claude Code: Codex and Copilot CLI use JSONL with similar structures.\n\nFiles are stored in ~/.claude/projects/{project_id}/{session_id}.jsonl. JSONL is a format where each JSON object is stored independently on a newline.\n\nMessages from the user or Claude and tool calls are stored that way. Here is an example of a message:\n\nOpenCode doesn’t use JSONL but instead independent JSON files. Message content is sharded by session id, message id, and message parts in ~/.local/share/opencode/storage/:\n\nThis design conceptually makes sense: not having to rewrite or append to a single file might be simpler. But for indexing, it means a lot more filesystem operations. To give you an idea: I used Claude Code possibly 100x more than OpenCode, yet OpenCode has 10x more files (9,847 vs 827). See Stats \n\nVibe stores one JSON file per session in ~/.vibe/logs/session/session_*.json. It is not JSONL. The file contains metadata and the full messages array.\n\nOne detail that surprised me: Vibe rewrites the entire file after each user turn. That means the file grows and gets fully serialized on every message, which is simple but doesn’t seem very efficient for long sessions.\n\nCrush is the only agent that uses SQLite instead of JSON files. Projects are listed in ~/.local/share/crush/projects.json, and each project has its own .crush/crush.db database.\n\nThe schema has a sessions table with metadata like title, message count, and cost, and a messages table with role and parts (stored as JSON).\n\nI’m surprised it’s the only agent using SQLite!\n\nTo search sessions, I started with a naive approach. I defined a common Session type and an adapter protocol to abstract each agent’s storage format:\n\nEach adapter implements three methods: find_sessions parses all session files and returns Session objects, get_resume_command returns the shell command to resume a session (claude --resume {id} for Claude, codex resume {id} for Codex), and is_available checks if the agent’s data directory exists.\n\nFor example, here’s the core of Claude’s adapter:\n\nAdding a new agent means writing one adapter file. Implement scanning, parsing, and the resume command. The search engine, TUI, and CLI all work automatically.\n\nOn startup, each adapter would parse its session files and return a list of Session objects. I cached the results in a sessions.json file and used file mtimes to know when to reindex.\n\nFor search, I used RapidFuzz because the experience I had in mind was the familiar fuzzy finding of fzf. For each session, I built a searchable string by concatenating the title, directory, and full content:\n\nRapidFuzz’s Weighted Ratio scorer compared the query against every searchable string. This scorer has an interesting backstory but it basically uses other scorers based on the lengths of the string.\n\nThe problem was that WRatio alone didn’t rank exact matches high enough. Searching for “fix auth bug” might rank “authentication fixes” higher than a session literally titled “fix auth bug”. I added bonuses on top of the fuzzy score: +25 if the query appears as a substring, +15 if all query words are present, and +30 if they appear consecutively. This helped with ranking quality, but the performance was not good enough for me. Every search scanned every session on every keystroke. The TUI would visibly lag while typing, and I’m trying to have a very reactive TUI.\n\nI needed a proper search engine. I first considered SQLite FTS5, which has a trigram tokenizer for similarity matching, but it works by comparing 3-character substring overlap rather than edit distance, which is what I’m looking for. I’m a very imprecise typer 😄\n\nI opted for Tantivy, an in-process full-text search library written in Rust, and the one powering Quickwit. Instead of comparing the query against every document at search time, we can use it to build an inverted index upfront: a mapping from terms to the sessions that contain them.\n\nTantivy’s FuzzyTermQuery uses Levenshtein distance, which is better for actual typos: “teh” matches “the” (distance=1), but wouldn’t match with trigrams since they share no 3-character chunks.\n\nWhen a session gets indexed, Tantivy tokenizes its content into terms and stores which document IDs contain each term. Searching for “auth bug” means finding documents containing “auth”, finding documents containing “bug”, intersecting the sets, then scoring the matches using BM25.\n\nLuckily, the only “official” bindings for Tantivy are for Python! So I was able to use it directly and very easily in my project.\n\nThe schema defines what gets indexed:\n\nText fields get tokenized and indexed for search. The raw tokenizer keeps the value as-is without splitting, which is useful for IDs and agent names where “copilot-cli” should stay as one token, not become “copilot” and “cli”. (cf Keyword query syntax)\n\nWhen the schema changes (adding a field, changing tokenizers), the index needs to be rebuilt. I track a schema version in a file alongside the index and clear everything if it doesn’t match:\n\nIt’s not very robust (I could bump the version to the same number into two concurrent PRs), but it’s good enough for now.\n\nFor fuzzy matching, Tantivy supports custom distance for queries. A fuzzy term query with distance 1 matches terms that are one character insertion, deletion, or substitution away from the query term. “atuh” matches “auth”, “bugg” matches “bug”.\n\nThe prefix=True flag also matches terms that start with the query, so “au” matches “auth” and “authentication”.\n\nI ran into the same ranking problem as with RapidFuzz: fuzzy matches sometimes outranked exact matches. The fix was a hybrid query that boosts exact matches:\n\nThe performance has been quite good with Tantivy. My use case is pretty basic and the dataset is very small in FTS terms, so I haven’t looked into performance optimization too much. But queries complete in a handful of milliseconds, which is perfect!\n\nThe first version of fast-resume rebuilt the entire index when any source directory changed. Adding one new Claude session meant re-parsing hundreds of Codex sessions that hadn’t changed.\n\nThe fix was tracking modification times per session. Tantivy stores each session’s mtime alongside its content:\n\nOn startup, fast-resume asks the index for all known sessions and their mtimes. Each adapter compares file mtimes against what’s known and only re-parses what changed or is new:\n\nIf a session’s mtime is newer than what’s in the index, re-parse it. If a session exists in the index but not on disk, mark it deleted. Everything else stays untouched.\n\nUpdates are atomic: delete the old documents and add the new ones in a single transaction before committing. This avoids a window where the session is missing from the index:\n\nIf nothing changed (the common case) the whole process is just reading mtimes and comparing numbers. In any case, this happens in the background while the TUI starts instantly (see streaming updates).\n\nMost adapters spend their time parsing JSON. Claude sessions are JSONL files with hundreds of lines. OpenCode has thousands of small JSON files spread across directories. Even with incremental indexing, the initial index build parses everything.\n\nTo try to gain a bit for performance, I switched the native json lib for orjson, which is a JSON library written in Rust that’s supposed to be a lot faster.\n\norjson’s loads also accept both strings and bytes, and it’s faster with bytes, so we can pass it the file directly in binary mode without converting to a string first.\n\nThe TUI is built with Textual, a Python framework for terminal interfaces. I discovered it with Mistral’s vibe coding agent. This and uv are the reason I wanted this project to be Python, even though I usually pick Go for CLIs.\n\nTextual provides a layout system, widgets, reactive state, and async workers, great to have a fully featured and snappy TUI.\n\nThe main screen has three parts: a search input at the top, a results table in the middle, and a preview pane at the bottom. Everything is reactive; changing state automatically updates the UI, which is a pattern I like and I’m used to with web frameworks.\n\nOn startup, results load instantly from the existing index. In parallel, all adapters compare file mtimes to find new or modified sessions and index them in the background. Each time an adapter finishes, the results table refreshes to include the newly indexed sessions. On first run or after a schema version bump, the index is empty so results populate progressively as adapters complete.\n\nThe TUI runs this off the main thread using Textual’s @work decorator. Each time an adapter finishes indexing, on_progress re-runs the current search query against the updated index, so newly indexed sessions that match appear immediately:\n\ncall_from_thread marshals updates back to the main thread for UI changes.\n\nSearch is debounced to improve responsiveness when holding delete for example, otherwise the TUI doesn’t have enough time to re-render after the search and it feels laggy.\n\nThe watch_search_query method is a Textual watcher: it gets called automatically when search_query changes. Setting the reactive variable triggers the search.\n\nSearch also runs in a background thread so the UI stays responsive while Tantivy works:\n\nThe query time gets displayed next to the search box, it’s surprisingly variable, from ~0.5ms to ~50ms on my laptop. But it feels pretty snappy!\n\nNavigation works with up/down, but also j and k. shift+tab to move from search to preview, / to focus back the search bar, return resumes the selected session. Scrolling also works with the mouse. You can resize the preview with + and - or hide it entirely with Ctrl+backtick.\n\nSearch terms are highlighted in the results table (title, directory) in fzf style and the preview pane using Rich’s Text.stylize(). One limitation: Tantivy returns matching documents but doesn’t expose which terms actually matched. So if you search “atuh” and it fuzzy-matches “auth”, only “atuh” gets highlighted, not “auth”. I couldn’t find a way to get the expanded terms from Tantivy.\n\nSince modern terminals support inline images through protocols like Sixel, I thought we could include coding agent logos to make it look nicer. The textual-image library handles terminal detection and rendering. Unfortunately, it doesn’t work with vhs, so I have to record demos manually!\n\nSession timestamps are colored based on age: green for recent, fading through yellow and orange to gray for old. Exponential decay maps time to a 0-1 value, which compresses older sessions together:\n\nThen t interpolates through color stops (green → yellow → orange → gray). A session from an hour ago looks noticeably different from one from yesterday, but three months and six months both just look “old”.\n\nPlain text search works fine for most queries, but sometimes you want to narrow results by agent or time. Rather than building a separate filter UI, I added keyword syntax directly in the search box. Type agent:claude to filter to Claude sessions, date:today for today’s sessions, dir:my-project to match directory paths.\n\nTextual’s Suggester provides autocomplete as you type: agent:cl suggests claude, date:to suggests today. It also handles negation, so agent:!co suggests !codex.\n\nThe parser extracts keywords from the query using a regex, handling keyword:value pairs, quoted values with spaces like dir:\"my project\", and negation with - or !. Whatever doesn’t match a keyword becomes free-text that goes to Tantivy.\n\nAgent and directory filters support multiple values: agent:claude,codex matches either agent, agent:claude,!codex means Claude but not Codex. Date filters have their own mini-language: date:today, date:yesterday, date:<1h (within the last hour), date:>2d (older than two days).\n\nThese parsed filters translate to Tantivy queries:\n\nWhen you press Enter on a session, the TUI doesn’t directly exec the resume command. Instead it stores the command and directory, exits cleanly, and returns them to the CLI wrapper:\n\nThe CLI then uses os.execvp to replace itself with the agent’s resume command:\n\nexecvp replaces the current process entirely: same PID, same terminal, but now running Claude or Codex instead of fast-resume. This is cleaner than spawning a child process because the resumed agent owns the terminal directly. Ctrl+C goes to the agent, not to a wrapper script.\n\nThe directory change happens first because most agents expect to be run from the project directory.\n\nSome agents support “yolo mode” to automatically approve edits and tool calls. Claude has --dangerously-skip-permissions for example. But it applies to the current instance of claude, not the session. So starting claude without this flag, you can’t resume a past session in yolo mode, even if that session was started in an instance of claude started with the flag.\nWhen you resume a session, fast-resume can detect if it was originally started in yolo mode and offer to resume the same way.\n\nAdapters that parse session files look for yolo indicators. Codex stores approval policy in a turn_context record:\n\nVibe stores it directly in session metadata:\n\nThe yolo flag gets indexed alongside each session. When you resume, the TUI checks in order: fast-resume’s --yolo flag overrides everything, then stored session yolo state, then if the adapter supports yolo but we don’t know the session’s state, a modal asks the user.\n\nSince we’re indexing all sessions across agents, we get analytics as a bonus. fr --stats gives you a breakdown of your session history:\n\nThis was a fun project! It was a good occasion to try a new framework for TUIs and use an in-process search engine to keep things snappy. I’m pretty happy with the result!\n\nI published it to PyPI, so you can try or install it with uv:",

    "description": "The woman also claimed an ER doctor told her to \"shut up\" as she screamed in pain during her initial visit to the hospital",
    "fullText": "A woman said she was sent home from her local emergency room after complaining about pain, only to later require surgery for bone spurs in her spine\n\n“I feel like now, because I wasn’t essential, and they didn’t act quick enough, that I’ve been left with permanent nerve damage and constant cramps every single night,” Amanda Young told a local news outlet\n\nA spokesperson for the hospital hit back at Young’s claims, however, stating her case was “thoroughly reviewed” and she received appropriate care at the time\n\nA woman said she was sent home from her local emergency room in pain — only to later require surgery for bone spurs in her spine.\n\nAmanda Young of Queensland, Australia, called an ambulance in 2023 due to escalating back pain and was taken to the Townsville University Hospital, where she said she received pain medication and was sent home shortly after, local outlet 7 News reported.\n\nFour hours later, Young told 7 News she returned to the hospital screaming in agony. There, she claimed she was met with opposition from the medical facility's staff, explaining, \"I was told by the doctor there to ‘shut up,’ [but] due to my symptoms and me being in pain, I couldn’t control it.\"\n\n“I was told they’ve already done everything that they can for me, that my medication was appropriate, that they’ve upped the doses of a nerve blocker that was already not working, which is why I ended up back in the hospital,\" Young added to the outlet.\n\nYoung told 7 News she eventually ended up being placed in a bed in the hospital following her pleas.\n\n“I couldn’t even get up and go to the bathroom. I begged them for a bedpan. They wouldn’t even give me a bedpan,\" she claimed to the outlet. \"I was forced to go off the side of the bed. It was very embarrassing.\"\n\nYoung also claimed to 7 News that when she requested more medication to help ease her immediate pain, she felt she was treated like a “drug seeker.”\n\n“I was told there was nothing wrong with me,” she said to the outlet.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nAccording to Young, she was eventually sent home in a taxi. She said she \"crawled” to her front door and into bed.\n\nThe next day, Young told 7 News she returned to the hospital and invoked Ryan’s Rule, which enables patients in Queensland to initiate an urgent review of their care if they believe treatment has not been appropriately escalated. (The rule is named for Ryan Saunders, a teenager who died in 2007 after he failed to receive appropriate medical care.)\n\nYoung said she was then taken to the hospital's surgery department for a consultation.\n\n“They medicated me straight away, gave me appropriate medication to settle down my symptoms. I was told that he did believe me and that they would eventually operate on me, but they weren’t going to talk about it at that point in time because of the pain and what I’ve been through the last 38 hours,” she told 7 News.\n\nWhen Young finally received surgery the following year, she told News 7 that surgeons removed a number of large bone spurs in her back that had not previously been discernible through an MRI.\n\nYoung claimed to 7 News that the operation took \"an extra four hours longer than what it was supposed to, due to the severity of the condition,\" and she believes her delay in care and surgery ultimately led to permanent damage.\n\n“I feel like now, because I wasn’t essential, and they didn’t act quick enough, that I’ve been left with permanent nerve damage and constant cramps every single night,” she explained to 7 News.\n\nIn a statement to PEOPLE, Townsville Hospital and Health Service chief executive Kieran Keyes said, \"While I acknowledge this patient’s experience and understand the distress associated with complex and chronic pain conditions, investigations into these claims have found that the patient’s concerns were not ignored and the care provided by our staff was appropriate.\"\n\nThe PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now!\n\n“The patient has previously raised a number of concerns with Townsville Hospital and Health Service regarding emergency department presentations, the use of Ryan’s Rule and the timing of follow-up treatment,” she continued. \"These matters were reviewed through our established patient feedback processes and were also referred to the independent Office of the Health Ombudsman, which concluded in January 2025 that the complaint had been managed appropriately.\"\n\n\"In relation to the patient’s presentations to the emergency department in March 2023, on each occasion, the patient was clinically assessed, provided pain relief, and managed appropriately based on symptoms and a clinical examination,\" Keyes added. \"In relation to claims about Ryan’s Rule, our senior clinical staff thoroughly reviewed the patient following concerns raised during one of her presentations to the emergency department. This included a senior medical officer, a clinical nurse consultant and an after-hours nurse manager. Hospital records indicate that no further Ryan’s Rule escalation was activated following these reviews.\"\n\nKeyes also said that \"Townsville Hospital and Health Service remains committed to providing safe, respectful and patient-centred care, and encourages any patient with concerns about their treatment to contact our patient feedback service.\"\n\nThe Office of the Health Ombudsman did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’S request for comment.\n\nYoung told 7 News that she is speaking out now because, while she has the privilege of advocating for herself, she worries about others who may not be able to do the same.\n\n“I’ve got a voice,” she said. “I can talk and advocate for myself, but it leaves me worried about the more vulnerable people that don’t know their rights, that are too afraid to speak up.”",

    "description": "\"It's time to build\" means there's no time to bone.",
    "fullText": "There's two things that I care about the most: the gym and my work,\" says Mahir Laul.\n\nThe 18-year-old took a leave of absence from New York University this past fall to work full-time on his HR tech startup, Velric. While his classmates are taking shots and hooking up, Laul is coding and lifting. That means almost no time for romance.\n\n\"I am obsessed with work,\" he tells me. \"My love life is in the gutters.\"\n\nHis young founder friends are a similar story, he says. The few who are dating found their partners before they started their companies, while the rest are \"locked in\" on building — and locking themselves out of the dating pool.\n\nSilicon Valley has long been the land where mixing work with play was seen as crucial to its growth. While Google and Facebook were being built, their staff were also tripping on ayahuasca and canoodling in \"cuddle puddles.\" Now, amid the white-collar job apocalypse and the cutthroat AI race, tech has gone hardcore. Ramp has seen a spike in corporate card purchases on Saturdays in the Bay Area. Foot traffic at San Francisco office buildings was up 21.6% year over year in July, per Placer.ai, the highest uptick among major cities. And as I found in conversations with more than two dozen young tech professionals, the industry's upstarts are pounding through hourslong coding sprints, working 996 schedules (9 a.m. to 6 p.m., six days a week), and proudly telling their investors and X followers how they've gone \"monk mode\" in service of scaling their startups.\n\nFor many in Silicon Valley's young hustle class, \"it's time to build\" means there's no time to bone. They're on one type of grind, and it's not on the dance floor, which shuts down early in San Francisco anyway. Tech's dating scene, never particularly hot, has frozen over.\n\nHackathons, pitch decks, scrambling for investors — the life of a startup founder has never been amenable to a rich dating life. Lauren Kay, a former dating app founder who now runs a literary business, tells me that when she was a member of the 2014 Y Combinator class, she had to ask her cofounder for permission to go on a first date at 10 p.m. on a Saturday. Still, she did meet her husband in that YC class. Douglas Feigelson, a member of that same class, says \"there was opportunity to drink and date when I was in YC.\"\n\nA decade later, many founders feel like they can't afford to make the time.\n\nA good relationship is like a good startup, says Daivik Goel, the 27-year-old founder of the payroll platform Shor. \"It takes a lot of time to nurture at the beginning if you want to do them right.\" For now, he only has the bandwidth to nurture one. Like many of his founder friends, he says, he's not on any dating apps, and he doesn't seek out hookups at bars. \"I haven't had the time to really invest yet.\"\n\nSeveral founders I spoke to described dating in founder terms. \"The opportunity cost is really high,\" says Annie Liao, the 24-year-old founder of AI learning startup Build Club. \"Every night you spent out is time you could have spent building your startup.\" She adds, \"Most founders wait until the startup is more stable, like Series B.\"\n\nLiao says her founder roommates aren't dating either. They hook up sometimes for fun — so long as they don't get \"emotionally attached.\" For those working seven days a week on their startup, opening Hinge is \"a big, big distraction,\" she says.\n\nSome blame the dating recession on tech workers treating dating like an extension of their work. Liao says her male friends often give women ratings, \"like KPIs.\" These ratings are out of 10, and offer a \"numerical logical quantification justified in their brains to help them make an informed decision on who to date.\" Allie Hoffman, founder of dating event The Feels, tells me her San Francisco clients often ask her: \"Am I going to meet my unicorn here?\"\n\nAmy Andersen, CEO of Linx Dating, says that founders who have spent years focusing on \"optimization\" and \"ROI\" are now approaching her, looking for an equally perfect partner.\n\n\"People want to biohack love,\" she says. \"They're not necessarily thinking intelligently.\"\n\nStartup advisor Dylan Oriundo has another theory: fear. Founders aren't just afraid to give up precious building time; they're also skeptical of the motives of their potential suitors as they build their potential unicorns.\n\n\"They're not going to want me because I don't have enough money,\" Oriundo says. \"Once I reach a certain goal, they're just going to want me for my money.\"\n\nTony Bennett notwithstanding, the city has long had a reputation for its poor dating scene. Some blame it on San Francisco's wealth gap; others blame the \"ratio\" — the perceived numbers gap between men and women. The city is comprised of 51% men and 49% women, which some men say gives women the dating edge. The gender disparities likely grow even wider within tight tech circles, with women accounting for 13.2% of startup founders in 2023, and about a quarter of the tech workforce.\n\n\"If you're straight and a guy, there's just not that many women,\" says Wesley Tian, cofounder of the AI photo platform Aragon. Fed up with San Francisco dating, he says that some of his friends \"import\" people from other cities: They'll travel to another hub, meet someone, convince them to do long-distance, and eventually get them to move to the Bay Area. Some of Tian's friends in tech are moving to New York so they can date.\n\nFilip Kozera, founder of the Y-Combinator-backed Wordware and a native of Poland, tells me that he's interested in women who have creative interests like painting or singing, but finds that most of the women in San Francisco are interested in tech. So he mainly goes to Europe to date. He also shares his plan to fix the city: Take 10,000 women in Miami, teach them that having \"a boat is not the most important thing in life,\" and ship them to San Francisco. (Maybe if these women were swapped with 10,000 deep learning engineers, Miami's long-promised tech scene would finally arrive.)\n\nAnd still others say the \"ratio\" is more of a mirage, and an excuse. Joyce Zhang, a San Francisco-based dating coach and former Stripe product manager, tells me that when her male clients complain about the ratio, she asks them: \"What is in your control that you can change?\"\n\n\"Who are the men who are actually emotionally available?\" she tells them. \"If you can do the work to be that, there will be plenty of options for you.\"\n\nThose in tech's rising class who are dating, I found, had been in their relationships long before they began building and pitching.\n\nYang Fan Yun met his girlfriend during his first semester at Stanford, years before he cofounded the browser assistant startup Composite. They dated for all of college, and eventually went long distance when she moved to New York and he stayed in the Bay Area.\n\nThe New York-San Francisco long-distance relationship was common among Yun's tech friends. Even more common: \"not dating.\"\n\n\"Being in a relationship is really helpful for building the company,\" he said, describing his girlfriend, who works at a bank, as a constant supporter and the company's first product tester.\n\nSeveral of the tech workers I spoke to seemed to hope for the same thing, to have an unconditional support system through the grueling slog of building a startup. The future Zucks and Bezoses yearn for their Priscilla Chans and MacKenzie Scotts. (Those entrepreneurial forebearers are even pushing for marriage. Tech titans like Elon Musk and Peter Thiel warn about a fertility crisis. Anduril cofounder Palmer Luckey says that people should have kids in their teens.)\n\n\"You've always heard the mentality, 'Behind every successful man, there's the right woman,'\" Laul say. \"Rather than looking for hookups, I tend to look for someone as a life partner. But it's been difficult.\"\n\nSean Horan, a professor of communications at Fairfield University who studies romance and the workplace, points to some theories of \"positive life-to-work spillover.\"\n\n\"If my personal life is fulfilled, I'll actually be happier at work, which should contribute to productivity,\" he says.\n\nAnd there are exceptions to tech's dating dry spell. Queer daters may be better off. They're unencumbered by San Francisco's ratio, and find a flourishing LGBTQ+ scene in the city.\n\nSorcerer cofounder Jia Chen grew up in Michigan. Moving to San Francisco, she's found bigger populations of queer and East Asian daters. \"There are so many accomplished girls that are very multidimensional,\" she says.\n\nSome of the locked-in and lonely, meanwhile, are turning to other solutions. I heard founders describe first dates where the pair worked side-by-side. Other tech couples are finding each other on the hottest new dating app: LinkedIn. When I ask Shruti Gandhi, an investor at Array Ventures, if young founders are using actual dating apps, she laughs. \"Yeah, she says, \"to network.\"\n\nHenry Chandonnet is a reporter on the Business News desk.

    "fullText": "A tiny Swiss ski town with a population of just over 10,000 will play host this week to a clash between two American politicians, President Donald Trump and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, and their radically different visions of the future of capitalism.\n\nNewsom announced on Friday that he will travel more than 6,000 miles to make his return to Davos, Switzerland, to speak this week at the World Economic Forum.\n\nOpponents criticized Newsom for being an out-of-touch \"Davos Democrat\" for attending the elite gathering of business and world leaders at least five times while he was mayor of San Francisco between 2004 and 2011.\n\nNewsom's return to the annual gathering of business and political elites is all about displaying a forceful rebuke to President Donald Trump on the world stage as Newsom potentially prepares a run for president, political experts told Business Insider.\n\n\"Newsom's arrival at Davos confirms his desire to be seen as the Democratic Party leader and go-to guy for world leaders wanting an alternative to President Trump,\" Sally Susman, a longtime democratic fundraiser, said.\n\nIn speeches and meetings, Newsom plans to argue that Trump's economic agenda has been a failure that other leaders should not be part of, Izzy Gardon, a Newsom spokesperson, said.\n\n\"The Governor will be bringing an extra suitcase of kneepads for anyone lining up to bend the knee to Donald Trump,\" Gardon said.\n\nNewsom himself did not shy away from the main reason he is returning: to counterpunch Trump. The president will speak on Wednesday, a day before Newsom.\n\n\"Trump's economic agenda betrays our nation: it is not 'America First' but 'Trump First' — rewarding the favored, punishing the dissenters, and burdening the rest,\" Newsom said in a statement. \"At the World Economic Forum, I will forcefully confront these abuses and resolutely defend the principles to which California owes its economic strength: disciplined governance, world-leading universities, boundless innovation, and an open embrace of global cultures.\"\n\nNewsom, who has yet to officially announce his candidacy, looks more presidential rubbing shoulders at a gathering of world leaders than he would staying in Sacramento, according to Ambassador Derek Shearer, the Chevalier Professor of Diplomacy at Occidental College.\n\n\"By coming to Davos, he can combine his role as the leading Democratic critic of Trump and as a serious contender to replace him as president,\" Shearer said. \"Of course, it's a high-stakes game, but so far, he is playing it well.\"\n\nNewsom will be rubbing shoulders with some of the richest people in the world at a time when some billionaires are fleeing California ahead of a ballot proposal that would impose a one-time 5% tax on residents with a net worth of more than $1 billion.\n\nNewsom has said he opposes the measure.

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — When President Donald Trump announced the audacious capture of Nicolás Maduro to face drug trafficking charges in the U.S., he portrayed the strongman’s vice president and longtime aide as America’s preferred partner to stabilize Venezuela amid a scourge of drugs, corruption and economic mayhem.\n\nLeft unspoken was the cloud of suspicion that long surrounded Delcy Rodríguez before she became acting president of the beleaguered nation earlier this month.\n\nIn fact, Rodríguez has been on the radar of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration for years and in 2022 was even labeled a “priority target,” a designation DEA reserves for suspects believed to have a “significant impact” on the drug trade, according to records obtained by The Associated Press and more than a half dozen current and former U.S. law enforcement officials.\n\nThe DEA has amassed a detailed intelligence file on Rodríguez dating to at least 2018, the records show, cataloging her known associates and allegations ranging from drug trafficking to gold smuggling. One confidential informant told the DEA in early 2021 that Rodríguez was using hotels in the Caribbean resort of Isla Margarita “as a front to launder money,” the records show. As recently as last year she was linked to Maduro’s alleged bag man, Alex Saab, whom U.S. authorities arrested in 2020 on money laundering charges.\n\nThe U.S. government has never publicly accused Rodríguez of any criminal wrongdoing. Notably for Maduro’s inner circle, she’s not among the more than a dozen current Venezuelan officials charged with drug trafficking alongside the ousted president.\n\nRodríguez’s name has surfaced in nearly a dozen DEA investigations, several of which remain ongoing, involving agents in field offices from Paraguay and Ecuador to Phoenix and New York, the AP learned. The AP could not determine the specific focus of each investigation.\n\nThree current and former DEA agents who reviewed the records at the request of AP said they indicate an intense interest in Rodríguez throughout much of her tenure as vice president, which began in 2018. They were not authorized to discuss DEA investigations and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThe records reviewed by AP do not make clear why Rodríguez was elevated to a “priority target,” a designation that requires extensive documentation to justify additional investigative resources. The agency has hundreds of priority targets at any given moment, and having the label does not necessarily lead to being charged criminally.\n\n“She was on the rise, so it’s not surprising that she might become a high-priority target with her role,” said Kurt Lunkenheimer, a former federal prosecutor in Miami who has handled multiple cases related to Venezuela. “The issue is when people talk about you and you become a high-priority target, there’s a difference between that and evidence supporting an indictment.”\n\nVenezuela's communications ministry did not respond to emails seeking comment.\n\nThe DEA and U.S. Justice Department also did not respond to requests for comment. Asked whether the president trusts Rodríguez, the White House referred AP to Trump’s earlier remarks on a “very good talk” he had with the acting president Wednesday, one day before she met in Caracas with CIA Director John Ratcliffe.\n\nAlmost immediately after Maduro’s capture, Trump started heaping praise on Rodríguez — this past week referring to her as a \"terrific person — in close contact with officials in Washington, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nThe DEA’s interest in Rodríguez comes even as Trump has sought to install her as the steward of American interests to navigate a volatile post-Maduro Venezuela, said Steve Dudley, co-director of InSight Crime, a think tank focused on organized crime in the Americas.\n\n“The current Venezuela government is a criminal-hybrid regime. The only way you reach a position of power in the regime is by, at the very least, abetting criminal activities,” said Dudley, who has investigated Venezuela for years. “This isn’t a bug in the system. This is the system.”\n\nThose sentiments were echoed by opposition leader María Corina Machado, who met with Trump at the White House Thursday in a bid to push for more U.S. support for Venezuelan democracy.\n\n“The American justice system has sufficient information about her,” said Machado, referring to Rodríguez. “Her profile is quite clear.”\n\nRodríguez, 56, worked her way to the apex of power in Venezuela as a loyal aide to Maduro, with whom she shares a deep-seated leftist bent stemming from her socialist father’s death in police custody when she was only 7 years old. Despite blaming the U.S. for her father’s death, she steadily worked while foreign minister and later vice president to court American investment during the first Trump administration, hiring lobbyists close to Trump and even ordering the state oil company to make a $500,000 donation to his inaugural committee.\n\nThe charm offensive flopped when Trump, urged on by Rubio, pressured Maduro to hold free and fair elections. In September 2018,the White House sanctioned Rodríguez, describing her as key to Maduro’s grip on power and ability to “solidify his authoritarian rule.” She was also sanctioned earlier by the European Union.\n\nBut those allegations focused on her threat to Venezuela’s democracy, not any alleged involvement in corruption.\n\n“Venezuela is a failed state that supports terrorism, corruption, human rights abuses and drug trafficking at the highest echelons. There is nothing political about this analysis,” said Rob Zachariasiewicz, a longtime former DEA agent who led investigations into top Venezuelan officials and is now a managing partner at Elicius Intelligence, a specialist investigations firm. “Delcy Rodríguez has been part of this criminal enterprise.”\n\nThe DEA records seen by AP provide an unprecedented glimpse into the agency’s interest in Rodríguez. Much of it was driven by the agency’s elite Special Operations Division, the same Virginia-based unit that worked with prosecutors in Manhattan to indict Maduro.\n\nOne of the records cites an unnamed confidential informant linking Rodríguez to hotels in Margarita Island that are allegedly used as a front to launder money. The AP has been unable to independently confirm the information.\n\nThe U.S. has long considered the resort island, northeast of the Venezuelan mainland, a strategic hub for drug trafficking routes to the Caribbean and Europe. Numerous traffickers have been arrested or taken haven there over the years, including representatives of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán’s Sinaloa cartel.\n\nThe records also indicate the feds were looking at Rodríguez’s involvement in government contracts awarded to Maduro’s ally Saab — investigations that remain ongoing even after President Joe Biden pardoned him in 2023 as part of a prisoner swap for Americans imprisoned in Venezuela.\n\nThe Colombian businessman rose to become one of Venezuela’s top fixers as U.S. sanctions cut off its access to hard currency and Western banks. He was arrested in 2020 on federal charges of money laundering while traveling from Venezuela to Iran to negotiate oil deals helping both countries circumvent sanctions.\n\nIn an unrelated matter, the DEA records also indicate agents’ interest in Rodríguez’s possible involvement in allegedly corrupt deals between the government and Omar Nassif-Sruji, a relative of a longtime romantic partner of Rodríguez's, Yussef Nassif.\n\nNassif-Sruji did not respond to emails and text messages seeking comment and an attorney for Nassif denied his client was involved in any nefarious activity, pointing out that he hasn't been accused of any crime.\n\n\"He has the utmost respect and confidence in the acting president's vision for Venezuela and believes she is a true patriot who has committed her entire life to the betterment of the Venezuelan people,\" the attorney, Jihad M. Smaili, said in a statement. “The insinuations that Mr. Nassif is currently involved in any untoward relationship with the acting president are false.”\n\nTaken together, the DEA investigations underscore how power has long been exercised in Venezuela, which is ranked as the world’s third most corrupt country by Transparency International. For Rodríguez, they also represent something of a razor-sharp sword over her head, breathing life to Trump’s threat soon after Maduro’s ouster that she would “pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro” if she didn’t fall in line. The president added that he wanted her to provide the U.S. “total access” to the country’s vast oil reserves and other natural resources.\n\n“Just being a leader in a highly corrupted regime for over a decade makes it logical that she is a priority target for investigation,” said David Smilde, a Tulane University professor who has studied Venezuela for three decades. “She surely knows this, and it gives the U.S. government leverage over her. She may fear that if she does not do as the Trump administration demands, she could end up with an indictment like Maduro.”\n\nMustian reported from New York.\n\nContact AP’s global investigative team at Investigative@ap.org or https://www.ap.org/tips/.\n\nThis story is part of an ongoing collaboration between The Associated Press and FRONTLINE (PBS) that includes an upcoming documentary.",

    "description": "With just 90 days to find a job, a laid-off visa holder used email hunting and a $50 book to land a new role at T-Mobile.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Aman Goyal, a 26-year-old associate product manager at T-Mobile. His words have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was laid off in September, just six months into my role as an AI product manager at an ad tech company. Because I'm from India and was on an F-1 optional practical training (OPT) visa, the layoff triggered an immediate 90-day deadline to either find a new job or leave the US.\n\nDuring my last job search in 2024, while finishing a master's degree in management information systems at Carnegie Mellon University, I submitted hundreds of applications before landing an offer.\n\nThis time, the tech job market felt even tougher — marked by widespread layoffs, uncertainty around the Trump administration's proposed $100K H-1B salary rule, and intensifying competition for AI-related roles.\n\nDespite these challenges, I landed my dream role within 60 days as an agentic AI product manager at T-Mobile. These three things helped me get the job.\n\nAfter learning I'd been laid off, I took a few days to process the news before diving into my job search. It was a big surprise, as I had recently received a positive performance review.\n\nWith my visa deadline looming, I knew I couldn't afford to wait long before starting to look. I applied for roles at several top tech companies and a few startups, but the startups that responded weren't willing to sponsor visas.\n\nI came across three roles at T-Mobile and applied to all of them. A friend referred me for two of the roles, but I accidentally left his name off the third application. Interestingly, the only role I heard back from was the one I wasn't referred for.\n\nThe job description was closely aligned with my past experience, and the lack of a referral didn't hurt me. I think referrals have become highly overrated, especially since it seems like almost everyone has one.\n\nMy referral contact was helpful in another way, though. I asked if he knew who the hiring manager was for the role, and he shared the hiring manager's name. I used the email-finding tool Hunter.io, which offers a free plan with a monthly search limit, to look up the hiring manager's email and sent a short message expressing my interest in the role.\n\nI could've asked my referral contact for the hiring manager's email, but not everyone feels comfortable sharing someone else's contact information, so it's helpful to have tools that let you find it yourself.\n\nFortunately, I found the right contact — and shortly after, the hiring manager connected me with the recruiter to schedule interviews.\n\nLanding an interview was only half the battle, and I knew I had to be fully prepared to make the most of the opportunity, so I spent about $50 on \"Decode and Conquer,\" a product management interview preparation guide by Lewis Lin.\n\nWhat I found most valuable about the community after I joined was how easily I could schedule mock interviews with other job seekers. Over about six weeks, I completed a few dozen mock interviews — some with senior or staff product managers at Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. A few of them were also hiring managers in their current roles, which made their feedback especially valuable.\n\nOne of the most helpful parts of the mock interviews was that they helped me build confidence and develop the muscle memory to answer questions spontaneously.\n\nDoing practice interviews — and also many real-life interviews — also helped me realize that many people focus too much on what they say during interviews and not enough on how they say it. It's essential to pace yourself, keep the interviewer engaged, and be mindful of how you're coming across, especially since attention spans are often short nowadays.\n\nSome interviewers prefer concise answers, while others appreciate more detailed responses. You have to read their body language and adjust your responses accordingly. I also learned how important it is to really understand the question before answering — instead of just reciting a rehearsed response.\n\nThe community also proved valuable for networking.\n\nOver about five weeks, I completed six interviews with T-Mobile that covered a range of topics, from product design to system thinking and agentic AI. I felt confident throughout the process.\n\nI received an offer in early November, about six weeks after being laid off, and started the role later that month. Today, I'm working on projects closely aligned with my background in AI, and I'm genuinely excited about the direction of my work.\n\nOne of the biggest pieces of advice I give to the young job seekers I mentor is that even in a tough job market, networking can still work. It may not come through a traditional referral, but in my experience, finding a way to connect directly with the recruiter or hiring manager can be a game changer.",

    "title": "America's homebuilding is powered by immigrant workers. Here are the places that rely on them the most.",
    "description": "American cities that build and remodel the most homes are also the most reliant on immigrant labor, new research found.",
    "fullText": "The American homebuilding industry relies heavily on immigrant workers. That's especially true in the cities that build and remodel the most homes, according to new research from Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies.\n\nIn the seven metro areas that issued at least 150,000 residential building permits between 2019 and 2023, an average of 54% of construction trades workers were foreign-born, the Harvard report found. The metros building and remodeling the most homes — from Los Angeles and Washington, DC, to Dallas and Houston — rely on a workforce that's often more than 60% foreign-born.\n\nThe construction industry faces a nationwide worker shortage in the hundreds of thousands. Given its reliance on foreign-born workers, President Donald Trump's mass deportations and restrictions on immigration threaten to deepen the worker shortfall, said Anirban Basu, the chief economist at Associated Builders and Contractors, a trade group that endorsed Trump in 2024.\n\nAs a result, economists and housing researchers expect the most dynamic US housing markets will be hit the hardest by rising construction costs — driven by higher labor costs and delays, in part due to the worker shortage.\n\n\"These places that are most reliant on immigrant labor are going to feel those effects most acutely, and may then have a hampered ability to respond to housing supply and demand needs,\" said Riordan Frost, a senior research analyst at the Harvard Center and the author of the report.\n\nMetros that build fewer homes tend to have far fewer immigrants as a share of their construction workforce. In metros that granted between 75,000 and 149,999 permits, an average of 40% of the workers were foreign-born. And in metros that permitted less than 75,000 homes, 22% of the workforce was foreign-born. Still, immigrants made up a disproportionate share of the construction workforce in those places, too.\n\nThe Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington metro area led the country in issuing new building permits between 2019 and 2023. During that period, 61% of the area's construction workers were immigrants. In that same period, nearly three-quarters of construction workers in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Pompano Beach area were foreign-born.\n\n\"There's demand for labor in these places because there's so much homebuilding activity, and that is what creates the economic opportunity for immigrants to come in and fill these positions, especially if they're positions that native born people aren't as likely to work in,\" Frost said.\n\nA recent survey by the Associated General Contractors of America found that 28% of construction firms say they've been affected, either directly or indirectly, by immigration enforcement. More than 90% of all firms that were hiring said they were having trouble filling open roles, and 45% of all firms said they experienced project delays because of a shortage of workers.\n\n\"There's no question in my mind the stepped-up immigration enforcement is serving to drive up construction delivery costs,\" Basu said. \"If all of a sudden these communities are no longer able to supply as much new housing, then their economic growth will tend to stagnate.\"\n\nAt the same time as the administration is cracking down on legal and illegal immigration, it's not doing enough to boost domestic construction training, AGC said.\n\nThe Trump administration says it's working with employers to streamline visa applications for temporary workers and boost vocational training.\n\n\"There is no shortage of American minds and hands to grow our labor force, and President Trump's agenda to create jobs for American workers represents this Administration's commitment to capitalizing on that untapped potential while delivering on our mandate to enforce our immigration laws,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement.\n\nImmigrants have long made up a disproportionate share of the country's construction tradespeople, particularly in homebuilding. And, as of 2024, an estimated 15 to 23% of the total construction workforce was living in the country illegally. In recent years, the number of native-born construction workers has shrunk significantly.\n\nIn the long term, improvements in construction productivity — including the growth of modular, factory-built housing — and a growing number of women and young people entering the industry could ease the worker shortage.\n\nBut for the next several years, at least, the worker shortage is set to worsen, helping drive up building costs and home prices.\n\n\"The construction workforce is set to become more expensive going forward,\" Basu said. \"And then when you layer on top of that, of course, increases in healthcare costs, electricity rates, those kinds of things, there's even more pressure on these households going forward.\"",

    "fullText": "We here at Business Insider thought it was time to talk about the future of capitalism.\n\nSeems we weren't the only ones.\n\nWhen California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced late last week that he would show up at Davos essentially to rebut whatever President Donald Trump plans to say, he specifically zoned in on, what else? Capitalism.\n\nAt Davos, the Democratic governor plans to \"draw a clear line between democratic capitalism and crony capitalism,\" according to his office. Newsom will \"contrast California's rules-based, competitive economic model with Trump's politics of intimidation, favoritism, and self-dealing.\"\n\nIn short, Newsom wants to articulate his own version of capitalism on the global stage.\n\nThat, coupled with Trump's Wednesday speech, which is expected to touch on affordability, shows just how hot the topic is.\n\nYou might recall that last month we put out a survey seeking your thoughts on the future of capitalism. And in the new year, we started a series on the subject. The first piece detailed the federal government's investments in private-sector companies under this White House. Newsom's office called those investments \"an unprecedented assault on free markets\" and took issue with other Trump moves.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Newsom's statements. A White House official earlier told Business Insider they viewed these equity stakes \"as a very powerful tool that we're using very judiciously in very specific sectors for very specific reasons,\" for purposes of US economic and national security.\n\nWe will stay all over this subject at Davos this week. () Meanwhile, our capitalism series has chronicled how America's high schools are teaching capitalism. See for yourself how you'd score on this 12th-grade capitalism quiz!\n\nThe next piece, slated for Monday, is on the capitalist spirit thriving in companies. Stay with us!",

    "description": "Tesla owners' reactions to Elon Musk's announcement that FSD would only be available for $99 a month ranged from frustration to enthusiasm.",
    "fullText": "Tesla is going all in on the Netflix model for its self-driving software — and owners we talked to have mixed feelings about the move.\n\nOn Wednesday, CEO Elon Musk announced that Tesla's supervised Full Self-Driving software — known as FSD — will only be offered behind its $99-a-month paywall after February 14.\n\nIt's a major shift for the electric-car maker. Tesla first began selling its self-driving software in late 2016 for $5,000, later raising the price (it's currently $8,000) and introducing a monthly subscription option in 2021.\n\nNow, drivers who want their car to steer, brake, and change lanes on its own will only have the option to pay $99 month to month.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with three Tesla owners about the change. Their reactions ranged from frustration to enthusiasm.\n\n\"It's a big turnoff for me,\" Leslie Snipes, an owner of a standard-range Model 3, told Business Insider. \"Especially since nearly everything is now a subscription.\"\n\nSnipes said she tested FSD during a complimentary one-month trial when she bought her car in 2022. She loved the feature at the time, but a lifetime purchase cost $10,000 back then — a cost she said was too high for her family.\n\nNow, her biggest concern is safety.\n\n\"I have much less confidence in Tesla's self-driving,\" she said. \"I've had multiple experiences where the cameras were inoperable due to low-light conditions or obstructions like rain, which makes this shift concerning.\"\n\nShe said she'd only consider paying for FSD for specific months, like when she is planning long road trips.\n\nScott Anderson, who just bought a Model Y in Arizona, said he never seriously considered paying thousands of dollars upfront for the software. He chose the monthly subscription and remains excited about the tech.\n\n\"My wife and I recently took a trip about 70 miles from home up into the mountains,\" he said. \"Our new car drove us the entire way without any interruptions.\"\n\nAnderson added that he hopes the monthly price will eventually come down as Tesla rolls out more advanced technology.\n\nBut for longtime Tesla owners who have already outright purchased the software, Musk's announcement carries different implications.\n\n\"I find myself using FSD more and more as I drive,\" Nikki Lindgren, a California Tesla owner who bought the technology years ago, told Business Insider. \"The change would mostly modify if or when we replace our current Tesla.\"\n\nLindgren said the shift to subscriptions could discourage her from buying a new Tesla unless the company allows customers to transfer previously purchased software to another vehicle.\n\nTesla didn't respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nTesla is facing some critical self-driving deadlines this year, including its robotaxis entering more major cities and ramping up volume production of the Cybercab.\n\nDelivering on the promises carries enormous weight for CEO Elon Musk. His attention-grabbing $1 trillion pay package is tied in part to the company's self-driving vision, raising the pressure to prove that its technology — and the revenue it generates — is moving closer to full autonomy.\n\nSeth Goldstein, a Morningstar analyst who monitors Tesla, said the company's switch to monthly subscriptions indicates \"growing confidence\" inside the EV maker about its technology's momentum. He even thinks drivers might soon be able to take their eyes off the road when the car is in FSD.\n\nBut he doesn't think that rollout will be paired with lower prices for consumers.\n\n\"Once unsupervised is released, I expect the price will rise to reflect the additional driving capabilities and we could see Tesla offer bundles that include charging and insurance in some states,\" he said. \"Admittedly, this just shifts the payment from one loan payment including the vehicle and FSD to two payments.\"\n\nGoldstein said he thinks most drivers will respond like Snipes, the most skeptical Tesla owner that Business Insider spoke to.\n\n\"This may lead to some consumers purchasing a Tesla as they can choose to buy FSD later or only purchase it in months when they plan to take a longer trip,\" he said.",

    "title": "Legendary investor Rob Arnott outlines the 2-part strategy that's helped his personal stock portfolio double the S&P 500 over 8 months",
    "description": "Rob Arnott's personal investment strategy takes advantage of a flaw in passive indexing  that his firm has also tried to capitalize on with a recent ETF.",
    "fullText": "Rob Arnott is revered in the investing world for his alternative passive index strategies, but when it comes to his own portfolio, the Research Affiliates founder likes to have a little fun playing the role of hedge-fund manager, too.\n\nIn an interview on Thursday, Arnott detailed a leveraged long-short strategy that has allowed him to double the returns of the S&P 500 over the last eight months. He shared with Business Insider screenshots of his personal brokerage account showing this strategy having produced a 36.67% return since mid-May. The S&P 500 has returned about 14% in that time.\n\nThe strategy comes from the idea behind the ETF Arnott launched in September: the RACWI US ETF (RAUS). The fund takes a fundamental approach to indexing, identifying companies with attractive qualities and valuations, and then weighting them by market capitalization.\n\nIt essentially seeks to correct what Arnott sees as flaws in passive indexes like the S&P 500, which add stocks following periods of outperformance, only to dump them when they've underperformed. RAUS has a 95% overlap with the S&P 500.\n\nSeeking to capitalize on this concept outside the index, Arnott had the idea to take long positions on the stocks that his index includes which the S&P 500 does not, and take short positions on stocks that the S&P 500 includes but his index does not. He then amplified those positions with leverage.\n\n\"One really fun strategy, and I wish this had occurred to me back in '21, is what if we go long our non-overlap holdings, strip out the whole 95% that's overlapped, just go long our 5% non overlap and let's short the S&P's 5% non overlap,\" Arnott said, referencing when Research Affiliates launched its Cap-Weighted Index, on which RAUS is based. \"Why stop there? Why not go 200% long and 200% short? I did that in my personal portfolio.\"\n\nArnott could not share the names of individual stocks in his portfolio for compliance reasons. However, in September, he listed Palantir (PLTR), DoorDash (DASH), and CrowdStrike (CRWD) as examples of S&P 500 stocks not in RAUS. Examining a list of RAUS's holdings, a few examples of stocks held in RAUS that are not in the S&P 500 include Xerox (XRX), Zoom Communications (ZM), and Rivian Motors (RIVN).\n\n\"One of my colleagues likes to say, 'Suppose I come to you and I say I've got this great strategy: I'm going to buy stocks when they've just doubled and when they're trading at twice the market multiple, and I'm going to sell stocks when they've just fallen in half and are trading at half the market multiple. Why don't you invest with me?'\" Arnott said. \"Most people would listen to that and say that's stupid, but that's the way index funds trade.\"\n\nIn September, Arnott illustrated this inefficiency in passive index funds with Dillard's Department Store, a repeat constituent of the Russell 1000 index.\n\n\"In the last quarter century, it has been removed from the index and added back to the index four times,\" Arnott said at the time. \"So buy low, high, low, four times, and every time you're doing enormous damage to your wealth if it's the only stock you're trading.\"\n\n\"How big a difference does it make? It's been a member of the Russell 1000 in 22 of the last 35 years. During those 22 years, it has underperformed the Russell index by 99%,\" he continued. \"In the 13 years that it wasn't a member, it gave you 67 times the wealth of the Russell 1000.\"",

It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was on a very strong upward trajectory in my manager role at DoorDash when I quit in 2025. I was making $390,000 and felt that I still had room to grow, but when I was honest with myself, my heart wasn't in it.\n\nLeaving to start my own silk womenswear brand wasn't an instantaneous decision; it was a long-term calling inside of me. It took a lot of courage to quit and choose the unknown.\n\nI still constantly ask myself if I made a huge mistake. I think to myself, \"How could I just leave a job that most people would dream of?\" It was high-paying, the benefits were great, and there was room for learning. But I don't want to look back and think I climbed the wrong mountain.\n\nIn 2022, I was hired as a strategy and operations manager on the homepage team at DoorDash. My job was challenging, and I got to wear a lot of hats. I also developed deep friendships with some truly talented people.\n\nHowever, I realized I missed the feeling of being close to the people I was building for.\n\nEarlier in my career, I had a small entrepreneurial chapter where I worked on a fashion wholesale startup. I built my own customers from the ground up and interacted with them every day.\n\nWhen I was 16, I moved from China to the US and later spent a year studying abroad in Paris. I've always lived between cultures and felt super energized by working with people from distinct backgrounds and creative disciplines. The more I thought about it, the more I realized I wanted my career to reflect that part of me, too.\n\nTech created a structure for me to learn and expand my horizon, but I was ready to try entrepreneurship again. I spent a lot of time journaling and reflecting on what business I really wanted to make.\n\nEvery weekend was dedicated to foundational discovery work and even talking to potential customers or friends to get some early feedback on different ideas. I even started connecting with other young, inspiring entrepreneurs at founder events, which expanded my horizons regarding what life might look like as an entrepreneur.\n\nFrankly, I was extremely scared every day, but seeing people thrive gave me more confidence to envision what it might look like for me. I decided on my business, Soir Si, where I make simple, minimal sculptural silk pieces. The mission is to make luxury accessible.\n\nEven though I was sure of my decision, walking away was scary, and honestly, it was really sad for me. However, the thought of not pushing to the edge of my potential was scarier than quitting.\n\nI have my own apartment in NYC, and I spend half my time in Paris, typically staying with friends or family, to fuel my creative inspiration during the design process.\n\nThe first month after quitting, I focused on building a strong visual and emotional identity for Soir Si by enrolling in online courses and even partnering with a freelancer. The next stages were developing my website, connecting directly with customers, and using my branding and website to open up my supply chain.\n\nNow I'm focused on securing and strengthening those relationships while sprinting toward product development.\n\nRight after quitting, I was so focused on transitioning into entrepreneurship that I didn't have time for self-doubt. I felt a mix of grief and sadness about leaving, but I also felt excitement about what was ahead of me. The doubts didn't start bubbling up until several weeks later, when I hit a steep learning curve. I realized I had no idea what went into manufacturing or production, or even how to find a pattern-maker.\n\nI remember the first time I visited some manufacturers in New York, they treated me like I had no idea what I was doing. I knew I didn't speak their \"language,\" and it felt alienating. However, those moments of self-doubt were always counterbalanced by the highs, such as building relationships with potential partners. For example, my branding designer is based in Italy, and my manufacturers are based in Portugal. Establishing those relationships from scratch without any experience gave me the assurance that I can really do this.\n\nEvery day, I wake up knowing I need to work really hard and give it my all to make this dream a reality. The gradual, positive feedback from peers or my audience feeds me every day, and it's fulfilling to work with people from around the world and get to talk about silk and the region it comes from.\n\nThere are still moments when I'm super scared about the path I chose. The self-doubt bubbles up, and it all feels overwhelming, but underneath it all is a steady sense that I'm building something that aligns with who I am, not just the perception of success or stability. I'm finally excited about life again.\n\nPeople might say this is a risky move, but everyone starts from nothing. I just had to be willing to take the first step.\n\nDo you have a story to share about quitting your six-figure job for a riskier path?

    "description": "The Education Department just gave defaulted student-loan borrowers more time to figure out payment plans and ensure their tax refunds aren't seized.",
    "fullText": "If you're behind on your student-loan payments, you now have more time to figure out a payment plan before filing your taxes.\n\nThe Department of Education announced on January 16 that it's temporarily pausing wage garnishment and the Treasury Offset Program, which seizes federal tax refunds, to give defaulted borrowers more time to repay their loans.\n\nPrior to this pause, defaulted borrowers were subject to both wage garnishment and the seizure of their tax refunds. Advocacy group Protect Borrowers and the National Consumer Law Center issued a warning to student-loan borrowers before the department's announcement, urging them to check whether they're in default before filing their taxes to prevent their refunds from being seized.\n\nIn May 2025, President Donald Trump's Department of Education resumed collections on defaulted student loans after a five-year pause, meaning that borrowers in default — which typically happens when a federal borrower does not make payments for more than 270 days — were once again subject to the consequences of defaulting, including wage garnishment and seizure of tax refunds.\n\nWithout the pause in place, the government could begin seizing a defaulted borrower's tax refunds after they file, leaving them without sufficient time to make a plan to return their loans to good standing.\n\n\"Once you've already filed your taxes, that process is underway. It is going to be nearly impossible to get your loans out of default before your refund would go out,\" Abby Shafroth, managing director of advocacy at the National Consumer Law Center, told Business Insider of what would happen were the pause to lift. \"And then it's very, very unusual to be able to get that refund back after it's already been seized. So the real moment of opportunity for borrowers is before they file their taxes.\"\n\nThe two groups suggested that borrowers call the Treasury Department's Treasury Offset Program Call Center at 1-800-304-3107 to see if they're on the Treasury's default list for having some or all of their tax refunds seized.\n\nOver 5 million student-loan borrowers are in default, and Shafroth said that while the government is required to send a notice to borrowers informing them of their default status and that they're subject to garnishment and benefits seizures, those notices generally just go out once via physical mail, and they can be easy to miss or forget about.\n\nIf a borrower is in default and is on the list to have their refunds seized, they can request an extension to file their taxes, giving themselves more time to figure out their options. Those options include loan rehabilitation, which requires a borrower to contact their servicer and sign an agreement to make 9 payments within 20 days of each due date over 10 consecutive months. While the process is time-consuming, it has the benefit of eventually removing the default status from a borrower's credit report.\n\nAnother option is loan consolidation, which is quicker than rehabilitation but does not remove the default status from a borrower's credit history. A borrower can apply to consolidate their defaulted student loans into a federal direct loan, which they can then continue paying under an income-driven repayment plan.\n\nShafroth added that a borrower might be eligible to have their defaulted loan canceled if they qualify for specific cancellation programs, such as those for borrowers who attended schools that closed before they completed their programs.\n\n\"A lot of working people depend on their tax refund to make ends meet, to get caught up on rent, to pay for necessary car repairs or expenses,\" Shafroth said. \"So that tax refund isn't a bonus for most people. It's really built into their annual budget, and it's important to protect.\"",

    "description": "Dr. Shah said he saw the biggest change in his personal health when he did small things consistently. Here's what he prioritizes daily.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Dr. Darshan Shah, the 53-year-old founder and CEO of longevity clinic Next Health, who's based in Malibu, California. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been a physician for 30 years. For the first three quarters of my career, I did all sorts of surgeries, from trauma and emergency surgery, to general and reconstructive cancer surgery.\n\nI loved surgery, and I still miss being in the operating room, but I was totally burnt out. I was not happy. I did not want to go to work, and I thought, who wants to live this way?\n\nI switched into longevity medicine about 10 years ago. I made the transition because I was 50 pounds overweight, had high blood pressure, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and an autoimmune disease.\n\nI learned the science of nutrition, exercise, sleep, and functional medicine, brought all of that to my life, and got off all my medications and diagnoses of chronic diseases.\n\nThe experience made me realize that reversing chronic diseases is the kind of medicine that I want to practice. I started health optimization and longevity clinics to help people improve their lifestyle, optimize their hormones, and get them to think about how to prevent and reverse chronic disease.\n\nI always say the most important thing is to have a really good daily routine. It doesn't need to be any medications, injections, or anything fancy. I saw the biggest movement in my own personal health journey when I did the small things consistently.\n\nI start off my routine first thing in the morning because the whole world is asleep, and it's the only time I really have for myself.\n\nThe critical thing is what I don't do when I wake up. I don't wake up with my phone anywhere near me. I charge my cell phone by the coffee machine when I sleep, which is at the opposite end of the house.\n\nThat's a critical piece of my routine, because the phone deteriorates our mornings and stresses us out the minute we wake up. I don't look at my phone until 15 minutes after I've woken up.\n\nI'm lucky to have a little puppy now, but even before I had a puppy, I would go outside. I think it's extremely important to go outside first thing in the morning. If the sun isn't up yet, I go back outside when it's up because sunlight exposure is so important.\n\nThe physical act of taking your body outside is something that has been ingrained in our biology since caveman days. Going outside sets your circadian rhythm, decreases your stress levels, and improves your heart rate variability.\n\nMy morning routine is my sacred time. It goes until about 6:15 a.m.\n\nThe physical piece of my morning routine involves a quick 10- to 15-minute workout that includes stretching and lifting weights. Even if I don't get to the gym for the rest of the day, at least I got my workout in first thing.\n\nIt's so important to get quick wins. You can even start off with two minutes or five minutes a day. It doesn't matter. Once you get that quick win, it will build upon itself.\n\nAfter I do the workout, I grab a cup of coffee and take all my supplements. I put creatine in my coffee and drink a vitamin mix called IM8. I also take a couple of other supplements, including True Nitrogen, Urolithin A by Timeline, and a probiotic.\n\nThe second part of my routine is learning something new. I read for 20 minutes. I'm usually reading two different books — one about health and wellness physically, and one about health and wellness mentally.\n\nI'll read five or eight pages of each book, and it helps me have something to think about for the rest of the day.\n\nI've been journaling for 28 years now. I'm on a streak of 10 years without missing a single entry.\n\nMy journaling routine involves me writing about my day yesterday, what I'm most grateful for yesterday, and what I'm most excited for today.\n\nI skip breakfast because it allows me to control my total amount of calories throughout the day. I'm not ever hungry during breakfast and if I eat it, I won't get as good of a workout because I'll feel bloated.\n\nAfter I drop off my kids, I'll go to the gym and workout for about 45 minutes. Sometimes I'll do a cold plunge before the workout or right after I wake up, but it's so painful. I'll find every excuse in the world to skip it.\n\nI do some sprint interval training on the days that I'm working out, which is five 30-second sprints, with a four-minute break. A lot of research shows sprint interval training is the best way to improve your VO2 max, which is your body's capacity to utilize oxygen. I also always lift weights, using every muscle group.\n\nI live in Malibu, and the closest Next Health is about a 45-minute drive away. So I try to go to a location maybe once a week. Otherwise, I have a co-working facility in Malibu, and I just work out of there because it's five minutes away from my home.\n\nMy work involves lots of things. I'm on a Zoom call here and there; I have meetings; I do talks; I record podcasts; I speak to patients. There's a nice mix of things I love to do.\n\nThere are three things that are key to every work day.\n\nNo 1: I try to spend as much of my work day on my walking desk as possible. Normally, I'll get about 20,000 steps in a day.\n\nNo. 2: I always make sure I eat an early lunch, which is always a big piece of fish or meat, with a salad. Sometimes I'll throw it in a wrap or sometimes I'll supplement it with an additional protein shake.\n\nI eat 40 to 50 grams of protein in my lunch every single day. I also get a lot of vegetables in. I come from a family of diabetics, and snacking is probably the reason my entire family was diabetic, so I avoid snacking.\n\nNo. 3: If I'm sitting, I try to make sure I'm never sitting for more than 45 minutes in a row. If I'm in a sitting position, I'll set a timer. When I get up, I'll do a little bit of exercise, like jump rope or air squats. I have dumbbells in my office and just two to five minutes of that keeps the blood flowing and keeps you moving.\n\nAfter lunch, I usually have a meeting, and then I'll put a 20 to 30 minute break in my schedule to meditate.\n\nI'll go to a quiet place and turn everything off, turn the lights down, and get into a quick meditation. Lately I've been using my Oura ring. It has this unguided meditation session where it just plays some background music.\n\nAfter lunch, I'm a little tired, and so meditating really helps me decompress, get a little rest in, and recharge for the rest of the day.\n\nI did trauma surgery for six years and it was stress bombs every single day. Now I feel like I have a good handle on my stress because I got desensitized a little bit. That being said, there are stressful situations, and I just learned to pause, look inward, and give myself two minutes to recalibrate.\n\nUsually, I'm done with work by 4 p.m., and I'll pick up my kids from the bus stop and go home. I'll usually like help the kids with some homework, and hang out with the family and talk.\n\nWe try to have the earliest possible dinner. After we eat, we go for a walk, which starts my wind down routine.\n\nAfter the walk, around 7:30 p.m., I'll get rid of my cell phone and put it on the charger.\n\nThen we change all of our lights to yellow. It's beautiful and it's super relaxing.\n\nThen we start the bedtime routine. My kids are 11 and 7 years old, and they go to bed by 8 p.m. Then maybe I do some reading, or three or four days a week, I'll do a 30-minute sauna session. I get into bed by around 9:30 p.m.",

    "fullText": "Experts warn use of VPNs makes it hard to limit access to technology that can create nonconsensual explicit images\n\nDays after Malaysia made global headlines by announcing it would temporarily ban Grok over its ability to generate “grossly offensive and nonconsensual manipulated images”, the generative AI tool was conversing breezily with accounts registered in the country.\n\n“Still here! That DNS block in Malaysia is pretty lightweight – easy to bypass with a VPN or DNS tweak,” Grok’s account on X said in response to a question from a user.\n\nGrok’s ability to allow users to create sexually explicit images, including images of children, has created a global outcry over recent weeks, with regulators and politicians around the world launching investigations. Indonesia and Malaysia became the first two countries to announce blocks on the technology, with Malaysia’s regulatory body saying last Sunday it had “directed a temporary restriction” on access to Grok, effective as of 11 January 2026. Officials in the Philippines have said they too plan to ban the technology.\n\nBlocking access to Grok is not straightforward, however. The technology not only exists across multiple platforms, including a standalone app and website, but is also integrated across X, which, along with Grok, is owned by Elon Musk’s xAI.\n\nOver the past week, X users, and even Grok itself, have advised people on how to bypass restrictions. This includes using a VPN – many of which are available for free – or changing domain name system (DNS), the protocol on the internet that turns address names into IP addresses that load websites.\n\nWhen the Guardian tried to use Grok in Indonesia, its website was working even without a VPN, though the Grok app did not work. Grok was also still responding to Indonesian accounts on X, where it functions as an integrated chatbot. X has not been subject to a ban.\n\nEven if governments could completely restrict Grok, though, this is not a real solution, said Nana Nwachukwu, an AI governance expert and PhD researcher at Trinity College Dublin.\n\n“Blocking Grok is like slapping a Band-Aid on a weeping wound that you haven’t cleaned,” she said. “You block Grok, and then you go around shouting you’ve done something. Meanwhile, people can use VPNs to access the same platforms.” Or, they could simply turn to one of the many other platforms that offer the same functions, including “smaller, general purpose AI systems that are largely unknown”, Nwachukwu added.\n\nGovernments should instead focus on law enforcement and investigating individuals who use such tools to break the law, she added. “Platforms are required by law to provide information to law enforcement when a crime has been committed,” Nwachukwu said. “If we see people being arrested, people being tried in courts, people being jailed for these offences, that’s a sign that this is a real crime.”\n\nX should build accountability into its platform – and clean itself up, said Nwachukwu: “All of those offending images should be removed from the platform.”\n\nOn Wednesday, X announced additional safeguards in response to continued public anger, saying it would stop the @Grok account on X from “allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis”, including paid subscribers. However, the Guardian found that it was possible to get around such restrictions by using the standalone version of Grok, easily accessible through a web browser, to create short videos in which clothes are removed from images of real women.\n\nThis could then be posted to X’s public platform, where it could be viewed by users around the world within seconds.\n\nMusk’s company also said that, in jurisdictions where such content is illegal, it will geoblock the ability of all users in those locations to generate images of real people in bikinis, or similar attire, in Grok on X, adding that “xAI is implementing similar geoblocking measures for the Grok app”.\n\nExperts warn users may still be able to get around such “geoblocks” through a VPN. It is also not clear in which countries such restrictions will be implemented.\n\nIn Malaysia, the communications minister, Fahmi Fadzil, has said restrictions on Grok would only be lifted once the ability to produce harmful content had been disabled, according to local media reports.\n\nDr Nuurrianti Jalli, a visiting fellow at the media, technology and society programme at ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, said the threat of blocking Grok could be a useful way to apply pressure to companies to respond quickly, adding that it “shifts the debate from ‘individual bad actors’ to questions of platform responsibility, safety by design, and accountability when safeguards fail”. It could also “slow the spread of abuse, reduce casual misuse and create a clear boundary around what authorities consider unacceptable”, she said.\n\nIn Indonesia, Grok has been used to create nonconsensual sexualised images of singers and celebrities, including one of the country’s most popular girl groups, JKT48, while in Malaysia, women report similar abuses, including cases where the tool has been used to remove their hijabs, according to Malaysian media.\n\nSome women resorted to publicly telling Grok on X that they do not authorise it to “crawl, take, process or edit” any of their photos.\n\nJalli said governments should push for greater transparency “about how safety measures are implemented, how abuse reports are handled and what enforcement steps are taken when harmful content is generated or circulated”.\n\nThe Malaysian communications and multimedia commission and the ministry of communications did not respond to a request for comment. Indonesia’s ministry of communication and digital affairs also did not respond.\n\nNwachukwu said safeguards should be built into the AI system, rather than “gates” built around it. “Both the [geographic] restriction from X, [and] the restriction from the government is gated access, and gates can be broken down,” she said.\n\nAdditional reporting from Hidayatullah",

    "fullText": "Our reviewer loved this wake-up light more than any other he’s tested – it’s even knocked his previous best sunrise alarm off the top spot\n\nRead the full ranking in our sunrise alarm clock test\n\nSince I first tested sunrise alarm clocks last winter, I’ve come to suspect that there’s no such thing as getting up on the wrong side of bed. What we ought to be worried about is waking up on the wrong side of dawn.\n\nDuring summer (and other times of the year, for late risers), the sunrise begins to rouse us before we wake up. The brain kicks into gear and sends signals to initiate all sorts of bodily processes, from metabolism to hormone release, which helps us to feel ready for the day. It’s a fundament of our circadian rhythm – and we miss out on it whenever we wake before it gets light.\n\nThat is where a sunrise alarm clock can fill the gap. These devices simulate dawn, glowing with increasing brightness in the run-up to your alarm, and for many this reduces grogginess and improves alertness upon waking. I’ve tested more than a dozen models – and I believe the Lumie Bodyclock Glow 150 is the best you can get.\n\nI test sunrise alarm clocks by using them to wake me up before dawn over at least a few nights – which is no hardship at this time of year. I’ve risen with the Bodyclock Glow 150 every day for two weeks, which has given me a fuller impression of its performance. As well as using it as a wake-up light, I’ve tested its sunset simulation mode and used it as a reading light before bedtime.\n\nLumie has seven sunrise alarm clock models, from the basic (but very good) Sunrise Alarm (RRP £49.98, now £38.48) to the elaborate Bodyclock Deluxe 750DAB (RRP £229, now £176.33), which moonlights as a digital radio.\n\nWith a £119 RRP (currently £106.49 at Healf), the Bodyclock Glow 150 is around the middle of the range – but in my view, it has all the features that matter. To help you wake up or drift off, there are programmable sunrise and sunset simulations, which progress through a naturalistic colour spectrum from reddish-orange to brilliant white (and vice versa).\n\nYou can adjust various parameters of these cycles, including their duration, maximum brightness, and – for sunrise mode – the alarm tone that will make sure you’re awake. There are 10 sounds, including birdsong, lapping waves and a shrill beep.\n\nThe device is controlled via buttons surrounding the digital display, which can automatically dim itself when darkness falls. It works as a reading light/night light, has a tap-to-snooze function, and features a cable management space on its underside.\n\nLumie is uniquely placed among sunrise alarm clock brands, having invented this category of product in 1992 as an offshoot of its existing Sad lamp range. Its original wake-up light, the Natural Alarm Clock, looked like an Edwardian space weapon, but later models successfully wed Lumie’s rigorous approach to dawn simulation with a more bedside-friendly design.\n\nLike most (but not all) Lumie wake-up lights, the Bodyclock Glow 150 is certified as a medical device.\n\nMedical certification: UK MDR 2002 and EU MDR 2017/745\n\nSunrise duration: 20, 30 or 45 minutes\n\nSunset duration: 20, 30 or 45 minutes\n\nDimensions: 19 x 12 x 16cm (WDH)\n\nExtra features: tap to snooze; auto-dimming digital display; cable management in base\n\nWhere better to start than the sunrise? The Bodyclock Glow 150 has exceptional sunrise simulation – superior to other brands and equal to other great Lumie models such as the Bodyclock Spark 100. Waking up before dawn, I experience a sensation that’s genuinely close to being bathed in sunlight because the device glows brighter (and lighter in hue) as your alarm time approaches. It has consistently helped me to wake up feeling more alert, in a better mood and less groggy.\n\nThis model surpasses the Spark 100 in its selection of wake-up sounds, several of which are lilting. For very reluctant risers and deep sleepers, there’s also a harsher-sounding alarm tone that’s sure to get your cortisol pumping. You can adjust the sunrise (or sunset) duration, too, with 20-, 30- and 45-minute periods to choose from. I found myself using a 30-minute sunrise most days, but switching to 20 minutes when I had limited time available for sleep.\n\nThe sunset simulation created a relaxing ambience as I wound down for sleep, with the light steadily growing dimmer and graduating from white to reddish-orange as the minutes marched on. However, I tend to read in bed until I conk out, so I preferred using a steady, low-light setting for as long as I needed it instead.\n\nControlling the Glow 150 is straightforward and intuitive, with every option configurable via five buttons on the front of the device (plus an extra one tucked away in the base that toggles the digital display’s automatic night-time shut-off).\n\nAs with most sunrise alarm clocks, the Glow 150 spends most of the day just sitting at the bedside, telling the time and acting as a lamp. It does a nice job of it, too, with a highly legible digital display and a finely adjustable bedside lamp mode that offers the ideal mellow lighting for bedtime reading.\n\nAnother plus: it’s lightweight and compact. I went on a short holiday while testing it and had no problem fitting it inside my suitcase, carrying it and setting it up in my hotel room. This is the sort of thing you may actually find yourself doing if you become habituated to using a wake-up light.\n\nThis is a nicely designed alarm clock, but I’ve tested models with greater bedside appeal (including some cheaper ones). Available only in black, this blobject will suit some bedrooms better than others. If other colours were offered, the Glow 150 would be able to blend more easily into a wider range of interiors.\n\nThere’s also slightly less adjustability with this model than with some competing sunrise alarm clocks, especially in terms of the sunrise length, where the choice of three durations may feel limiting to some.\n\nMy only full-blown reservation is with the steep price (from £106.49 at the time of writing), but think of it as a real investment in your quality of sleep.\n\nSunrise alarm clocks don’t suit everyone, but for many people – myself included – dawn simulation makes a significant difference to the experience of waking up before sunrise. The Bodyclock Glow 150 is the best model I’ve tested, and although it’s expensive, it could prove precious to many who feel groggy in the mornings. Lumie offers a 45-day trial on its wake-up lights, but bear in mind that you’ll need to have all the original packaging (and pay for postage) if you wish to return it within that period.\n\nFor more, read the most-hyped sleep aids, tested",

    "fullText": "Big tech treats our attention like a resource to be mercilessly extracted. The fightback begins here\n\nIn the last 15 years, a linked series of unprecedented technologies have changed the experience of personhood across most of the world. It is estimated that nearly 70% of the human population of the Earth currently possesses a smartphone, and these devices constitute about 95% of internet access-points on the planet. Globally, on average, people seem to spend close to half their waking hours looking at screens, and among young people in the rich world the number is a good deal higher than that.\n\nHistory teaches that new technologies always make possible new forms of exploitation, and this basic fact has been spectacularly exemplified by the rise of society-scale digital platforms. It has been driven by a remarkable new way of extracting money from human beings: call it “human fracking”. Just as petroleum frackers pump high-pressure, high-volume detergents into the ground to force a little monetisable black gold to the surface, human frackers pump high-pressure, high-volume detergent into our faces (in the form of endless streams of addictive slop and maximally disruptive user-generated content), to force a slurry of human attention to the surface, where they can collect it, and take it to market.\n\nFracking (of the Earth and of our minds) produces tectonic instability, toxicity and the despoliation of our landscapes, natural and social. We now know that the heedless exploitation of our external environment has been so relentless and irresponsible that human survival on Earth has been placed in actual jeopardy. The new “gold rush” into the inner environment of the human psyche is well on its way to effecting parallel, if even more insidious destruction.\n\nThe stakes are existential. And that is because, rightly understood, our actual human “attention” – the thing the frackers want, in the form of our eyes on their screens – is nothing less than our ability to care, our ability to think, our ability to give our minds, time and senses to ourselves, the world and each other. To commodify that is to commodify our very beings. The problem isn’t “phones”, and it isn’t “social media”. The problem is human fracking, a world-spanning land-grab into human consciousness – which big tech is treating as a vast, unclaimed territory, ripe for sacking and empire.\n\nThat’s the bad news. The good news is that novel forms of exploitation produce novel forms of resistance. What fills the coffers of the six largest corporations on the planet is nothing other than the stuff of our humanity. Which is to say this new fight for our attention stands in a long line of clashes between those who are willing to reduce people (their labour, their eyeballs) to cash value and those who insist on a higher view of human flourishing. This history is long and complex, and often painful. But it tells us this much: we can fight back. Indeed, we must.\n\nSo what is to be done about this new kind of human exploitation that is harming us – harming children and adults, compromising our deliberative politics and our psychological wellbeing? Regulatory efforts are piecemeal and actively thwarted by the powerful interests in play. Psychopharmacological fixes for the ever-expanding damage merely monetise the destruction in a complementary way and render us better able to submit to conditions that are palpably at odds with human flourishing. How to confront a problem that is both unspeakably intimate and unthinkably extensive?\n\nThe answer is clear: we, the actual people of this planet, must come together in decisive solidarity; we must say no to the human frackers, and do so by insisting, in new ways, that human attention is human, and it is ours, and we will use it to make the worlds in which we want to live. In other words, we need a movement.\n\nThink that sounds quixotic? Well, keep in mind that’s how actual change actually happens. And it can happen fast. The environmental movement as we know it did not exist in 1950, but by 1970 it was a global force. In 1946 Reynolds Tobacco was using doctors to promote cigarettes. Fewer than 20 years later, the American Medical Association and the US surgeon general publicly averred that smoking caused lung cancer.\n\nAnd the changes get much bigger than that. Precious few do-gooders devoted themselves to environmental politics in 1925. That’s because “environmental politics” wasn’t even a thing. It took a cultural shift (and the work of advocates such as Rachel Carson) across the mid-20th century to establish the physical environment – the unity of land, water, and air that produces shared life – as a politically tractable object around which diverse groups could organise. This is to say that the very structures of politics, not just our beliefs and hopes, are themselves emergent forms. New things come into being, and old things pass away.\n\nWhere attention is concerned, there are mounting signs that we are reaching an inflection point. People of all sorts, Maga Republicans and Mamdani progressives, hipsters in Portland and evangelicals in Arkansas – people who don’t agree about anything – all actually do agree that something is totally wrong with a world in which everyone spends nearly all their time scrolling endlessly through the algorithmic feeds of their social media, a world where military-grade technology and trillion-dollar corporations take aim at children, and feed them whatever it takes to keep them hooked.\n\nYou can only abuse people so much, and then, eventually, they turn, they rise, they insist on something else. Already politicians on the right and the left are identifying this issue as one that moves the electorate. In 30 years, we will look back, and this era – the wild west of the tech princes’ smash-and-grab into our hearts, souls and relationships – will be difficult to explain to our grandkids. “How did you all let that happen?” they will ask. And we’ll have to say: “It’s hard to explain: it happened before we noticed; it was so much fun, especially at first; it took us time to figure out what was going on … ”\n\nBut we are figuring it out. We write as representatives of a fast-growing and increasingly well-organised movement, focused on pushing back against the human frackers, and giving shape to a new politics of human attention. At the heart of our efforts? The formation of broad coalitions devoted to the politics of human attention, the practice of diverse forms of study that call forth the life-giving powers of the mind and senses, and the promotion of sanctuary spaces for the protection and cultivation of the kinds of attention that make life good. We call this work attention activism.\n\nOur claim? That all of us already have the tools to resist the frackers, because all of us already have things we do and care about that put us beyond the reach of the algorithms. We all already know the deepest truth: that true human attention isn’t the click and swipe of screen time. True human attention is love, curiosity, daydreaming and taking care of ourselves and others.\n\nYes, new technologies give rise to new kinds of exploitation and resistance. But new forms of exploitation can even give rise to genuinely new forms of politics. You couldn’t brutalise an industrial proletariat before the factory system. Steam engines set the conditions of possibility for this development. They weren’t themselves a “problem”, of course; they gleamed and were precise and powerful. Who could see them operate without awe? But they also created a world in which it was possible to aggregate and extract physical labour from human beings in a revolutionary way. Along the way, they created a new kind of political subject, Homo economicus, a person who had been reduced, in the calculus of modernity, to “labuor value”. Actual revolutions followed – and a new kind of politics was born which reflected a new world of industrial labour, and new forms of labour solidarity, such as unions and workers’ parties.\n\nThe new system of human fracking is turning all of us into attentional subjects in a powerful new way. Homo attentus is the end user of every networked system – economic, political, expressive. With this new form of life comes, as we have discovered, appalling new vulnerability. But we are on the brink of understanding the new power that has come into our hands in the fracklands. We believe a new kind of politics beckons. What will it look like? It is hard to say. And there are reasons to be fearful. But if we, the people, can take up the banner of a new kind of freedom movement – a movement for the true freedom of attention itself, what we call attensity – and deploy our truly human attention in new ways, with a new understanding of the stakes, we can defy the frackers, and insist on creating, together, a human world.\n\nD Graham Burnett is professor of history at Princeton University.

    "fullText": "Over the next few months leading up to the April 15 deadline, people across the United States will be filing their federal income taxes. When they do, it sounds like many Americans could be in for a pleasant surprise.\n\nOver the past few weeks, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who also serves as the acting director of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), has been sharing that many Americans should expect \"gigantic\" and \"very large\" refunds this year as a result of some significant rewrites to the tax law in the United States.\n\nBack in July, the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB) was signed into law, bringing several high-profile changes to the tax code that offer tax relief across a broad range of categories. These changes are expected to impact nearly everyone who will file taxes this year.\n\nThe changes include several high-profile new tax deductions, including an increase in the standard deduction, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on new car interest, and additional tax deductions for seniors.\n\nThese changes are expected to cut taxes for many individuals throughout the United States, particularly in the middle and upper-middle classes.\n\nFollowing these tax changes, it sounds like Americans can expect significantly larger tax returns this year compared to previous years. Bessent has described the expected refunds as \"gigantic\" and \"very large\" on separate occasions.\n\nBessent expects that households throughout the United States could see \"$1,000, $2,000 refunds\" on average.\n\nThe White House has cited recent research from the financial services firm Piper Sandler indicating that the refund check could increase by $1,000 compared to the 2025 filing season.\n\nThe reason for the inflated tax refunds, Bessent explains, is that the tax changes were retroactive, applying to all of 2025 even though the bill was not passed until July. As a result, the vast majority of working Americans did not update their tax withholding to account for this, leading to significant refunds.\n\n\"The bill was passed in July, working Americans didn't change their withholding, so they're going to be getting very large refunds in the first quarter,\" Bessent said, via Newsweek. \"So I think we're going to see $100-$150 billion of refunds, which could be between $1,000, $2,000 per household. Then, they'll change their withholding, and they'll get a real increase in their wages.\"\n\nPiper Sandler economist Don Schneider explained that adjusting tax withholding would have been quite difficult, considering the extra provisions like no tax on overtime or no tax on tips.",

    "description": "Industry experts told Business Insider that 2021-2022 was probably the top of the market, and luxury watch prices won't see a similar boom anytime soon.",
    "fullText": "The luxury watch market is coming off a wild sugar high.\n\nAfter what looked like an unstoppable rally in watch prices at the tail end of the pandemic, the market for high-end timepieces has cooled. The corner of the luxury consumer space could also be sluggish for years, with low single-digit growth that pales in comparison to the pandemic era, industry analysts told Business Insider.\n\nThat relative decline has been triggered by a few factors. While people have less time and money on their hands, less flashy, more austere fashion trends rooted in \"Quiet Luxury\" are also having an impact, watch industry insiders said.\n\nSecondhand prices in the luxury watch market have dropped sharply from their highs during the pandemic. The WatchCharts Overall Market Index, a gauge of secondhand luxury watch prices, is down 33% from its peak just after the pandemic, though it is up about 5% over the past year.\n\nHigh-end watches were the worst-performing luxury category last year, according to Claudia D'Arpizio, a partner at consulting firm Bain & Company.\n\nWhile a few dominant brands are seeing some growth — kingmakers like Rolex, Patek Philippe, and Audemars Piguet — virtually all high-end watchmakers in the business are struggling or stagnating at the moment, she said, even those with a \"great heritage\" name.\n\n\"The rest are all facing difficult times,\" she said, speculating that the watch market could continue to normalize and remain broadly weak for several years until the global economy enters a fresh growth cycle.\n\n\"Probably we are near the bottom, but it's really difficult to say,\" she said.\n\nRevenue growth in the broader online jewelry and watch business has collapsed from its 2020 peak. Growth is also expected to remain near zero through the end of the decade, even lower than the average growth rate in the years leading up to the pandemic, according to an estimate from IBISWorld.\n\nOliver Müller, a longtime consultant in the luxury watch business and the founder of LuxeConsult, said he believed 2021 and 2022 were likely the best-ever years for the watch market, with the industry unlikely to achieve a similar growth rate in the foreseeable future.\n\nHe attributed the post-COVID bubble to a unique cocktail of circumstances that pushed newcomers into the watch market — mainly, people having extra time on their hands to get into new hobbies, and the fact that crypto markets and meme stocks were delivering big gains in very little time for many traders.\n\n\"The crypto boys, as they call them, all of a sudden discovered that there was something called watches on which they could flip a lot of money,\" he said, referring to the practice of traders buying high-end watches to quickly resell them at a profit on the secondhand market.\n\n\"I don't think we will get back anytime soon to those crazy high prices that we have seen,\" he said.\n\nAndrew Morgan, another watch consultant, said he believed the market reached its zenith in 2022.\n\n\"I think to get to those prices, again, we're talking decades,\" he said, speculating that the market would only see \"shallow\" growth from here on out.\n\nThe pandemic-era watch vibe was marked by \"flashy\" styles and special edition models that flew off the shelves, D'Arpizio said. The buying spree was largely driven by ultrawealthy clients who were sitting on big gains on their investments and were willing to splurge.\n\nMany speculators in the market at the time also seemed to be interested in integrated or stainless steel sports watches, styles that tend to be associated with \"over wealth.\"\n\n\"Luxury watches got swept up as part of this whole affluent luxury, Instagram lifestyle,\" Morgan said.\n\nFor luxury watches, it seems to have kicked off a new era: one defined less by excess and more by refinement, D'Arpizio and Morgan said.\n\nThough there are exceptions, the worst-performing models on the market tend to be integrated and stainless-steel sports watches, Morgan said. While models from leading brands are still reaping a \"mild\" return on the secondary market, models from most other brands face a \"significant depreciation\" the minute they're sold, he said.\n\n\"Some of those really spiky hype watches have calmed down, and are continuing to calm down,\" Morgan said of watches that contributed to the pandemic spike. \"Collectors of classy reserve time pieces will still purchase those, but the reasoning for purchasing them has become more about a personal self-reflecting sense of achievement, rather than a publicly broadcast sense of self-achievement, if that makes sense.\"\n\nIt's difficult to equate \"quiet luxury\" with the watch market, since watches are by definition a status symbol, D'Arpizio. But she agrees a more \"conservative\" style has proliferated, with most consumers now focusing on classic pieces from timeless brands — something that can be worn again and again.\n\n\"These SKUs are superstars and very recognizable, so they are not really quiet, but for sure the model stays, and the value stays,\" she said of the more understated vibe among shoppers. \"They don't want to make a mistake, so they choose the safe side.\"",

Diners eventually sat at the bar, and when I, Alice, went to the bathroom around 1:20 p.m., a gaggle of waiters was congregating by the kitchen, discussing table numbers over a window crammed with burgers and salads.\n\nApart from the kitchen, though, the crowded restaurant didn't feel cramped. Tables were far enough apart that we couldn't hear others' conversations, yet the background din of conversation made the room feel lively. The only deal talk we overheard came from a woman on her way out, who mentioned her interest in bringing ESRT, the company that owns the Empire State Building, on as a client.\n\nSo when it comes to layout, it's not a bad spot for a semi-private, relatively casual business lunch.\n\nFor a restaurant in Midtown Manhattan, the price point wasn't too surprising, but it seemed more suited to dinner than lunch. The cheapest item in the entrée section was $31.\n\nOne table of four almost entirely ordered the macadamia-nut-crusted fresh catch, and our waitress said the ahi tuna poke bowl was also a popular lunch choice. There were also a number of salad orders around the restaurant, which seemed fitting for lunch.\n\nThe $23 \"world-famous\" coconut shrimp appetizer arrived at our table fairly quickly — it was the only item we knew we had to try during our visit.\n\nThe shrimp sat atop a papaya and mango chutney, adding another layer of sweetness to the coconut coating. The cabbage salad that sat on top was our favorite part of the plate. The coleslaw was dressed with a light vinaigrette, and the cilantro added a nice freshness.\n\nUltimately, though, the overall dish was too sweet for our liking, and we left some lonely shrimp on the plate.\n\nI, Jordan, admit that I'm a newbie to ordering French dip sandwiches. I was expecting mine to come with caramelized onions and Swiss cheese. For $33, the Tommy Bahama wagyu French dip came with neither, despite the description listing sweet-and-sour onions as an ingredient.\n\nThe missing onions aside, I found myself taking some of the sliced beef off to make the sandwich a little easier to bite into. I felt kind of silly picking the valuable wagyu out of my sandwich, but I wanted to be able to close it properly. The broth was good for dipping, but I was left wanting more thinly sliced beef and additional ingredients.\n\nOur waitress surprised us with two free desserts: the piña colada cake and malted chocolate pie.\n\nThe cake was incredibly sweet, and we initially didn't realize it had any pineapple, but the whipped cream was, unsurprisingly, fantastic. Jordan said the chocolate pie was the only dish that tasted exactly as it looked. An Oreo crust is rarely a bad thing, but we agreed we wouldn't order it again.\n\nFor $145, we were sufficiently underwhelmed by the food. Then again, everyone else around us seemed pretty pleased, and the service is efficient without feeling rushed.\n\nAs a Wall Street go-to, Tommy Bahama presents a funny inverse. Many firms are setting up outposts in the south, namely in Texas, but the beachy restaurant is trying to bring southern, Floridian charm to 45th Street. And it is, at times, easy to forget that you're in the middle of Manhattan while sitting in the palm-filled dining room, until you look out the window, or at the guys in Charles Tyrwhitt vests sitting next to you.\n\nThe noise level and layout are conducive to a genuinely productive, laid-back business meal, and it's an easy escape from Manhattan's chaos. Provided you like the food, we see how it could become an unlikely power lunch staple.\n\nThe price is comparable to that of a steakhouse dinner, but it's nothing the corporate card can't handle, right?",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Cesar Carvalho, the CEO and cofounder of Wellhub, a global corporate wellness platform. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI became interested in consulting through some older friends while studying at the University of São Paulo in Brazil. Their stories about how fast you could learn and grow in the career made me want to pursue it.\n\nI applied to all the top firms and accepted McKinsey's offer to be a business analyst in 2010 as soon as I received it. It was the best thing I could imagine as a long-term career.\n\nI was at McKinsey for about two years before they encouraged me to pursue an MBA. At that time in Brazil, you could only become an associate or a manager if you had one.\n\nI applied to Harvard Business School with the intention of returning to McKinsey and continuing the consulting journey. But the summer of my first year in Boston, I had the idea of starting WellHub.\n\nThe working environment at McKinsey was super intense. I would do an average of 10 to 12 hours a day, and when there was a crunch, it could be more.\n\nAs a consultant, I often traveled to different cities or juggled between a client's office and McKinsey's office. There were no gym memberships that provided access to facilities in different locations.\n\nIf I were at a client site and had two hours before my next meeting, I would have nothing to do but extra work. I had three gym memberships that were going unused, and I wanted to feel less stressed and improve my well-being.\n\nMy experience showed me there was a need for busy workers to get convenient access to health and well-being. And I quickly realized that was true not just for CEOs, bankers, and consultants, but also for FedEx drivers and grocery store workers.\n\nIt's now been 14 years since I started Wellhub.\n\nWe're now in 18 countries, and partner with 40,000 companies to offer wellness to their employees, including many McKinsey offices. 5 million employees engage with Wellhub every month.\n\nWith Wellhub, employees can book a class regardless of the country or city they are in, without needing a membership for a specific gym or studio. Companies pay a fixed monthly fee based on their employee count, and employees also contribute.\n\nI grew a lot at McKinsey, and that was especially thanks to one thing — in two years, I worked under seven different partners, all with their own managing style.\n\nIt could change everything: the team culture, the hours you're putting in, and the work you prioritize. I quickly learned what worked well for me, and what didn't.\n\nThe best experiences I had were when we were given flexibility. Some leaders used a process I always use today: a kickoff meeting in which every single employee is given the opportunity to talk about their own boundaries and how they operate.\n\nManagers with families would say their ideal schedule was to go home early, eat with their families, and then log back on if needed. My own boundary at McKinsey was that I was willing to work as much as needed during the week, but my weekends were sacred. During my two years at the company, I worked only four or five weekends.\n\nI learned that when expectations are clear and leaders are good enough to ask and respect the boundaries of employees, you can get everything done and still have great morale.\n\nI also made a ton of friends, and those connections became really important. My Wellhub cofounder and several colleagues worked at McKinsey with me, and two of my seven angel investors were my previous bosses.\n\nCompanies benefit from having employees who are active and in a great state of well-being.\n\nIf companies don't support well-being, they won't just be less productive — they'll also have higher costs than peers who do invest in it.\n\nIt impacts the amount of sick leave and PTO people take, and plays into retention and attraction.\n\nThe trend some corporate companies have taken towards hardcore culture is completely insane. Hustle culture is a liability, not an asset.\n\nMany CEOs are missing the mark, and the consequences will show up as companies underperform those that take a more balanced approach. Hustle culture leads to burnout, and it pushes great people out before they would otherwise leave.\n\nAs a CEO, I believe in treating every employee like an adult and trusting them. My focus is always on getting the work done — not how many hours it takes or whether someone is showing up to the office.\n\nWhen I meet coworkers, we typically do a yoga session or a workout, instead of going to bars or restaurants. If you switch a happy hour for a wellness hour, and build healthy habits into everyday routines, you can improve well-being across a company.\n\nTo me, well-being means being productive, healthy, and happy. I put productive there because it means that happiness and health are being put to good use.\n\nI want to be a great CEO to my employees, want to inspire our clients and partners to join the movement, but more importantly, I want to be a great dad to my three kids, and a great husband to my wife.\n\nMy solution is integrating life and work. You don't need to be sacrificing your marriage or family for success.\n\nWhen people ask me, \"What are your hours?\" I say, \"I'm working all the time. I'm thinking about work when I'm exercising.\"\n\nI have also built rituals in my well-being journey that I almost never break.\n\nWhenever I'm traveling, I call my kids at 7:30 p.m. no matter what — even if that means setting an alarm for 2 a.m. It's a way for me to be close to them, no matter where I am.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career as a consultant?

    "description": "Cassindy Chao had a career spanning JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, but never felt she thrived. Now she's a matchmaker, and feels 100% more fulfilled.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Cassindy Chao, 57, a matchmaker based in the Bay Area. This piece has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nFinance is a young person's arena. Long hours and stamina are treated as essential markers of a coveted hire. As I got older, I found myself wondering where that left someone like me: a middle-aged mom of three.\n\nI couldn't control getting older, so in 2022, at the age of 54, I became a full-time matchmaker.\n\nFor the first time in my career, my age is an asset.\n\nI'm American-born Chinese, and in families like mine, there's often a plan: get good grades, attend a reputable school, and secure a respectable job. My parents wanted me to pursue a career in medicine, but because I struggled with chemistry. I went to Wellesley and majored in Chinese studies and economics.\n\nIn my sophomore year, I became involved with the Asian Association's blind-date semi-formal. I had a lot of fun, even though I made some of the worst matches back then.\n\nI was so engrossed by match-matching that I started organizing the semi-formal event during classes and even dropping classes to focus on it. I never imagined it could be a career.\n\nI graduated in 1990 and got a job at an investment bank. I loved art and creative work, but I needed a career that paid well because I wanted to send money to my parents. I got rejection after rejection from JPMorgan in New York, but as Asia boomed in 1993, being fluent in Mandarin became an advantage, and I got a job in the Hong Kong office\n\nA year in, Goldman Sachs offered me a role in Hong Kong as well. The culture was one of working hard and playing hard, ultracompetitive, yet tight-knit. You made close friends because you were working late nights together on deals.\n\nWorking at Goldman was addictive: I was getting paid a lot, traveling, and generally having a lot of fun, but I struggled with the numbers, and writing reports never came easily to me.\n\nI also found myself sacrificing my energy, creativity, and life to fulfill the needs of an organization. Deals were time-sensitive, people are accustomed to quick turnaround times, and it was all-hands-on-deck for various projects.\n\nIt takes a lot out of you, and I remember my mom telling me that if I stayed at Goldman Sachs, I'd never get married. I think she was right.\n\nIn May 1999, after five years at Goldman Sachs, I returned to California and got married soon after. My mom was sick at the time, and as painful as that period was, it forced me to stop and assess where I was going and what came next.\n\nIt became clear that investment banking was not where I thrived.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2016, I worked on various projects in financial consulting: I was helping close companies for VCs and businesses manage their overseas operations.\n\nI had to draw boundaries around my time because it was intense, but the pay was good.\n\nIn 2013, I read an article in a magazine about a matchmaker in Chicago. I had no idea that it could be a career, and I read loads of books on the topic.\n\nIn 2015, I trained with a matchmaker and initially did it as a side hustle, which I publicized by building a website and emailing my network — long before I understood the power of a proper newsletter.\n\nIn 2021, I attended my first matchmakers' conference, where I learned tips and tricks from seasoned professionals. It helped me build my business through word of mouth, and I became a full-time matchmaker in 2022.\n\nAs a middle-aged woman with caring responsibilities, it works great. I drive the business and get to do what I want, how I want, when I want. I love the independence.\n\nThe best part of my job is facilitating an unexpected match — finding love for people who would otherwise never have met. Another great aspect of my work is that I constantly talk to younger people. I learn a lot from them, and they give me new perspectives.\n\nOne of the biggest fears around ageism is becoming irrelevant or out of touch, but that hasn't been my experience. The younger people I work with teach me about things like SEO and PR, and in return, I share the perspective and wisdom I've gained over the years.\n\nI feel 100% more fulfilled than I did in my previous career, and it will remain sustainable as I age.\n\nGetting older doesn't matter. In fact, the older I get, the better because, after all, it means I'm wiser.",

    "description": "The Alexander brothers' New York sex trafficking trial is scheduled to kick off with jury selection in a Manhattan federal court on Tuesday.",
    "fullText": "Brothers Tal and Oren Alexander — once among the nation's top luxury real estate brokers — along with a third brother, are set to stand trial in Manhattan this week over allegations that the trio operated a long-running sex-trafficking scheme.\n\nJury selection in the federal criminal trial is scheduled to kick off Tuesday in the same 26th-floor courtroom where last year Sean \"Diddy\" Combs was cleared of the top sex trafficking and racketeering counts against him and convicted of lesser prostitution-related charges.\n\nThe case against the Alexander brothers marks the Department of Justice's latest high-profile sex-trafficking prosecution to reach trial since the Combs case. In the aftermath of the hip-hop mogul's trial, an attorney for Tal Alexander hailed the Combs verdict as both \"refreshing\" and \"heartening\" to Business Insider.\n\nTal, Oren, and Oren's twin, Alon Alexander, who was an executive at his family's private security firm, have vehemently denied the sex crimes charges against them, as well as all other allegations. They've been locked up at a notorious federal jail in Brooklyn since their December 2024 arrest in Miami.\n\nThe FBI began investigating the Alexander brothers after The Real Deal first reported in June of that year that two women had filed civil lawsuits against Oren and Alon Alexander, accusing them of rape. Those lawsuits sparked a wave of additional allegations against the brothers.\n\nAttorneys for the three brothers did not respond to requests for comment by Business Insider for this story.\n\n\"The brothers were young adults navigating social situations that may not have been perfect,\" a spokesperson for the Alexanders, Juda Engelmayer, told Business Insider, \"but that is not criminal conduct and bears no resemblance to trafficking.\"\n\nIf convicted at trial, the three brothers, who are 38 and 39, could face up to life behind bars.\n\nManhattan federal prosecutors, in court papers, have accused the Alexander brothers of working together and with others to drug, sexually assault, and rape dozens of women over more than a decade in posh locales like the Hamptons, Miami, and Manhattan.\n\nProsecutors have said in court filings that several attacks happened at Hamptons mansions, while another was aboard a Bahamian-flagged cruise ship.\n\nThe Alexander brothers face 12 felony counts, including conspiracy to commit sex trafficking and sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion, according to a superseding indictment filed last week. The indictment ties the charges to eight accusers, including two who were minors.\n\nThe superseding indictment also accuses Oren Alexander of recording himself and another person \"engaging in sexual activity with a incapacitated 17-year-old girl in Manhattan.\"\n\nThe government's case rests on allegations that the Alexanders used their wealth and prominent positions \"to create and facilitate opportunities to rape and sexually assault female victims\" in a scheme that ran from roughly 2008 to 2021.\n\nOren and Tal Alexander began their real estate careers at Douglas Elliman before launching their own brokerage, Official, in 2022.\n\nProsecutors said the Alexanders sometimes planned sexual assaults in advance, luring victims to locations with the \"promise of luxury experiences, travel, and accommodations.\" Other times, the Alexander brothers chose their victims by chance, prosecutors allege.\n\nProsecutors said that ahead of the sex attacks, the brothers \"shared photographs of women and girls to select those they found sufficiently attractive to invite.\"\n\n\"The defendants and other men attending the trips pooled financial resources in order to pay for flights and other travel expenses for the women and girls,\" prosecutors have said in court papers.\n\nIt will ultimately be up to the jury to decide whether the brothers are guilty of the sex trafficking charges they face.\n\nDefense attorneys for the brothers have argued in court documents that the government overreached by bringing federal sex trafficking charges because the statute requires a \"commercial sex act\" that the indictment failed to allege.\n\n\"The Government alleges, as the 'thing of value,' that Defendants 'lured' their victims with 'promises of luxury experiences, travel, and accommodations.' But that is not enough to establish a 'commercial sex act,'\" defense attorneys for Tal Alexander wrote in a June motion to dismiss, which the other brothers joined.\n\nThe lawyers wrote that the accusers did not provide sex \"on account of\" those promises \"as the statute requires.\" They added that the travel and accommodations \"did not represent compensation for the sex acts.\"\n\nThe defense lawyers argued that the government's effort to frame the brothers' alleged conduct as federal sex trafficking \"rests on a dangerously overbroad theory—one that would, if accepted, convert nearly any accusation of date rape into a federal sex trafficking offense.\"",

    "fullText": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Thousands of people gathered Saturday at San Francisco’s Civic Center to celebrate the life of Bob Weir, the legendary guitarist and founding member of the Grateful Dead who died last week at age 78.\n\nMusicians Joan Baez and John Mayer spoke on a makeshift stage in front of the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium after four Buddhist monks opened the event with a prayer in Tibetan. Fans carried long-stemmed red roses, placing some at an altar filled with photos and candles. They wrote notes on colored paper, professing their love and thanking him for the journey.\n\nSeveral asked him to say hello to fellow singer and guitarist Jerry Garcia and bass guitarist Phil Lesh, also founding members who preceded him in death. Garcia died in 1995; Lesh died in 2024.\n\n“I’m here to celebrate Bob Weir,” said Ruthie Garcia, who is no relation to Jerry, a fan since 1989. “Celebrating him and helping him go home.”\n\nSaturday’s celebration brought plenty of fans with long dreadlocks and wearing tie-dye clothing, some using walkers. But there were also young couples, men in their 20s and a father who brought his 6-year-old son in order to pass on to the next generation a love of live music and the tight-knit Deadhead community.\n\nThe Bay Area native joined the Grateful Dead — originally the Warlocks — in 1965 in San Francisco at just 17 years old. He wrote or co-wrote and sang lead vocals on Dead classics including “Sugar Magnolia,” “One More Saturday Night” and “Mexicali Blues.” He was generally considered less shaggy looking than the other band members, although he adopted a long beard like Garcia’s later in life.\n\nThe Dead played music that pulled in blues, jazz, country, folk and psychedelia in long improvisational jams. Their concerts attracted avid Deadheads who followed them on tours. The band played on decades after Garcia’s death, morphing into Dead & Company with John Mayer.\n\nDarla Sagos, who caught an early flight out of Seattle Saturday morning to make the public mourning, said she suspected something was up when there were no new gigs announced after Dead & Company played three nights in San Francisco last summer. It was unusual, as his calendar often showed where he would be playing next.\n\n“We were hoping that everything was OK and that we were going to get more music from him,” she said. “But we will continue the music, with all of us and everyone that’s going to be playing it.”\n\nSagos and her husband, Adam Sagos, have a one-year-old grandson who will grow up knowing the music.\n\nA statement on Weir’s Instagram account announced his passing Jan. 10. It said he beat cancer, but he succumbed to underlying lung issues. He is survived by his wife and two daughters, who were at Saturday’s event.\n\nHis death was sudden and unexpected, said daughter Monet Weir, but he had always wished for the music and the legacy of the Dead to outlast him.\n\nAmerican music, he believed, could unite, she said.\n\n“The show must go on,” Monet Weir said.",

    "fullText": "The hosts of The Big Weekend Show on Fox News were shocked and disgusted to learn that anti-ICE protesters in Minnesota were using Grindr and other dating apps to “expose” ICE agents.\n\nFox News highlighted a Saturday report from the New York Post on “lefty TikTokers” who are calling on their comrades to “get those d*ck pics and selfies and share them widely,” as one user put it.\n\nThat same TikTok user told her “gay friends in Minneapolis on Grindr” to be on high alert for ICE agents “because you know that [the app is] blowing up right now with all of the visitors from out of town and I bet you could get some pretty good info.”\n\nAnother user urged her fellow anti-ICE Minnesotans to send screenshots of agents on Bumble and other dating apps; she said she was compiling a folder full of details on ICE agents and needed as much ammo as she could get.\n\nThe Big Weekend Show showed clips of those women making their pleas before getting the panel’s reaction.\n\n“Are they trying to shame federal agents who may be homosexual? They always bring their own arguments full circle—” co-host Joey Jones started to ask before Fox News contributor David Webb jumped in.\n\n“Let me ask the left — what do you have against homosexuals or somebody whose gay if they happen to be in law enforcement?” Webb asked. “You gonna out them?”\n\nWebb said Minnesotans would be better off if ICE “unmasked all of these rioters, these people who are out there protecting criminals [and] committing crimes.”\n\nBeyond patrolling Grindr, protesters have been demonstrating against — and in some cases “physically” interfering with — ICE raids following the shooting death of Renee Good.\n\nA moment later, Jones said it was sick that lefty Minnesotans want to “want to go after the individual, not the job they’re doing or the policy that Congress passed.”\n\nFox News senior correspondent Alicia Acuna agreed, saying the protesters have their priorities backwards.\n\n“They don’t come out and shame the violent criminals who have been arrested, who are in this country illegally and victimized so many people,” Acuna said. “They have no shame.”\n\nThe post ‘What Do You Have Against Homosexuals?’ Fox News Hosts Shocked By Minnesota Protestors Exposing ICE Agents on Grindr first appeared on Mediaite.",

His father, Sufiel, was born in Melilla - a Spanish city on the north African coast - into a Moroccan family. From early on, Brahim grew up understanding that identity does not need to be singular.\n\nAs a child, he travelled several times to Nador to visit his grandmother and cousins. There, he was dressed like any other Moroccan boy. In family photos he appears next to his grandmother, wearing a traditional Moroccan veil. Brahim has often summed it up simply: \"I have always felt 100% Spanish and 100% Moroccan.\"\n\nBefore 11-a-side football, Brahim was shaped by futsal. At four or five years old, he was already learning to survive in tight spaces. That influence remains visible today: close control, dribbling in crowded areas, explosive acceleration, and the ability to strike with the toe when there is no time to adjust.\n\nHe later moved to seven-a-side, playing for modest Malaga-based teams such as Tiro Pichon and Mortadelo. Malaga wanted to sign him when he was just five or six, but his father chose patience: small teams, futsal, learning without rushing.\n\nWhen he eventually joined Malaga and began to stand out - before the age of 16 - Europe took notice. In 2010, at a tournament organised by Spanish radio legend Jose Ramon de la Morena, Brahim was named MVP. His Malaga side were eliminated by Real Madrid in the semi-finals but he left his mark, scoring against Luca Zidane.\n\nManchester City then arrived with a clear, long-term project. Brahim moved to England in 2015. He did not speak English, but education had always been central within the family. A year later he signed his first professional contract. City were no longer just a big club - they had ambition, structure and a globally respected academy. Today, Brahim speaks English fluently and feels he was offered a very strong foundation in Manchester.\n\nWhile many young talents accept early loans, Brahim refused shortcuts. At 17, modest Spanish top-flight clubs wanted him on loan. He said no. In his mind, only one path existed: consistency and elite surroundings. His entire family moved to Manchester with him.\n\nThe next step felt inevitable. In 2019 he joined Real Madrid in a £21m deal - a record fee at the time for a City academy product. The opportunity was irresistible. But his early period in Madrid was disrupted by a series of injuries which prevented him from settling and building continuity at the Bernabeu.\n\nA three-season loan spell at AC Milan followed. There, his career reached a defining moment: wearing the iconic number 10 shirt and playing a decisive role in Milan's Serie A title. He delivered important goals, stood out on big European nights, and showed leadership that went beyond his years and what his slight frame might suggest.\n\nThen came his return to Madrid.",

    "fullText": "SYDNEY, N.S. — American forward Emily Pohl and blueliner Margaret Averill notched two goals and added two assists apiece to help lead the United States handily take the Swedes out of gold medal contention with a 9-1 win Saturday evening at the 2026 IIHF Under-18 Women's World Championship at Centre 200.\n\nForward Jane Daley was one of five other players to put one on the scoreboard for the U.S., making her record-setting 12th goal of this year's tournament, according to the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). She leads all players with 17 points total.\n\nAverill and Pohl opened it up in the first to make it 2-0 going into the first intermission, forwards Jillian McLaughlin and Daley added a couple \n\nThree of those first seven goals were scored on American powerplays, including one on a five-on-three in the second, which included a two-minute interference from defender Ebba Westerlind and a five-minute spearing penalty, that came with a game misconduct, from forward Moa Stridh, served by fourth-liner Greta Johansson, which certainly didn't help the Swedish squad with the game off the ice — and perhaps their mentality on the ice.\n\nThat being said, there were plenty of Swedish fans in the stands in the Cape Breton arena, wearing team jerseys, holding up brightly coloured signs, and cheering them on throughout, but the whoops and hollers were perhaps no louder than when Tilde Grillfors snuck one past American goalkeeper Bianca Birrittieri on a powerplay just over three minutes into the final frame, narrowing the gap to 7-1 for the U.S.\n\nDespite the Swedish support in the crowd, and the goalie change from starter Meja Engelin to Thea Holmberg going into the third period, there just wasn't enough time for the yellow and blue squad to catch up to the visibly stronger American team.\n\nCentre Talla Hansen scored on an Averill assist and winger Lindsay Stephnowski capped it off with help from Pohl to seal the 9-1 deal and earn a berth to Sunday's gold medal game for the United States.\n\nBirrittieri didn't earn the shutout but made a solid 17 stops for the U.S., while Engelin made a respectable 25 saves on 32 shots against. Holmberg saved seven of nine shots in her third-period appearance in the crease.\n\n\"This sucks,\" Swedish captain Ebba Westerlind told reporters matter-of-factly after the tough semifinal loss.\"We compete every time,\" she said, adding, \"the U.S.A. is really good, so we try to do our best.\"\n\n\"I think we did some good things... (but) I felt like they were first on the pucks, especially in the first period,\" she said, but pointed out \"we did better throughout the game.\"\n\nNow that Sweden is moving on from semis, it's time for \"eat, sleep, rest,\" Westerlind said of focusing on what's coming next for her country at U18 women's worlds — a chance to go home with bronze medals around their necks. \"We know we have to do the best we can... and focus on the win.\"\n\nSweden will play for bronze bragging rights earlier Sunday at Centre 200. The Swedes last won a silver medal at the 2023 IIHF Under-18 Women's World Championship, which they hosted in their home country in the northern community Ostersund.\n\nAs for the Americans, four-point contributor Pohl said, \"we don't take any of our opponents lightly.\n\n\"We knew it was going to be a good game, but I think all of us are us are prepared,\" the Woodbury, Minn., native said.\n\n\"Our coaches and teammates do a great job preparing all of us. So, (we) just (to) have fun and smile out there, and play our game that we know how to play.\"\n\nUnited States head coach Courtney Kennedy said her team was \"enjoying the moment\" of the semifinal celebration before turning thoughts to tomorrow's battle for the world championship title.\n\n\"It was a lot of work to get here,\" she said. \"I'm very proud of the players, and I'm proud of the way they played through all three periods of every single game, and it's uphill from here.\n\n\"Whoever wins this next game, we're going to have to prepare and get back to the drawing board about what we need to be successful, and both teams that we could end up playing, they're both fantastic, they're well-coached, and (Sunday) will be a hard, hard game.\"\n\n\"Tomorrow's another day,\" Kennedy said.\n\nEarlier Saturday, Finland beat Slovakia 7-1 in a relegation game, marking the first time the normally top-ranked women's hockey country, which means they'll be moving down a division in the IIHF under-18 international pool.\n\nThe large scoring gaps at this U18 worlds isn't what many fans, or serious women's hoockey watchers, want to see, as international development should be helping close these gaps to ensure competition continues to improve and the game continues to grow worldwide.\n\nSweden faces off in the bronze medal game at 3:30 p.m. AT, while the United States goes for gold at 7:30 p.m. AT.",

    "description": "Trade rumors are one thing, but being booed by your own fans is another. For Giannis Antetokounmpo, the frustration in Milwaukee has hit a new level.",
    "fullText": "Trade rumors are one thing, but being booed by your own fans is another. For Giannis Antetokounmpo, the frustration in Milwaukee has hit a new level. For the third time this season, they have lost three or more games in a row. While this may lead to some discontent, a Bucks assistant coach spills the beans on the issues in the locker room.\n\n“I think we just haven’t bought into everybody being stars in their role consistent enough,” said Rajon Rondo on the KG Certified show. “I think that’s the frustration part. Obviously, you know the big fella missed a lot of games, and you know it’s a big thing about now how we’re trying to be good without Giannis on the court. We may go in spots or lows, whereas two or three possessions where we don’t take care of the ball. That’s where the gap continues to grow.\n\nIt’s magnified now, obviously, because of trade deadlines, rumors here and there; it’s like it’s all magnified. Even though it’s a small market, it’s still the Milwaukee Bucks, and it’s Giannis’ team. So we’re going through it, but as I said, it’s the NBA grind; you can’t win a championship. But again, I just think we do have some great pieces; it’s just about everybody being consistent. That’s one of the things that we’re trying to do.\n\nAs a member of the Bucks’ 2024 coaching staff, Rondo offers a behind-the-scenes perspective on the team’s struggles. From mid-November to mid-December, the Bucks lost 13 of 16 games and remain in a Play-In berth, far below expectations.\n\nDespite a promising 4-1 start, the season has unraveled to a disappointing 17-24 record, putting a harsh spotlight on the team’s costly offseason moves. They went all in by waiving and stretching Damian Lillard’s deal, which will additionally take up $22.5 million of the Bucks’ cap space. Milwaukee also agreed to a four-year, $107 million contract with Myles Turner. With three consecutive first-round exits and numerous roster changes, Giannis Antetokounmpo remains frustrated.\n\nRondo pointed out that, given how this slump coincided with Giannis missing games, his name being constantly circled in trade rumors, and then the Bucks fans booing their own players. While the 23-year-old star is performing at his career best, the same can’t be said for the rest of the roster. Veterans such as Myles Turner, Kyle Kuzma, and Gary Trent Jr. have all seen their scoring averages dip from last season.\n\nIt doesn’t help the morale when Antetokounmpo made a social media move, leaving everyone wondering about his motives. Just a few weeks ago, the Bucks superstar deleted every single tweet dating back to July 2021. Then, insiders continued to drop trade updates, as ESPN’s Brian Windhorst confirmed that the Greek Freak had conversations with the front office during the offseason about possibly making a move to New York.\n\nDuring a humiliating 33-point loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves, Bucks fans at Fiserv Forum voiced their frustration loudly and repeatedly. The Bucks were without Myles Turner, but still fell apart against a Timberwolves team missing Anthony Edwards and Rudy Gobert. Giannis finished with 25 points on 9-of-13 shooting, eight rebounds, and five assists, but his performance was not the talking point.\n\nAt the start of the third quarter, the Bucks were already down by 31. Antetokounmpo went in for a powerful layup, finishing through contact and drawing a foul on Julius Randle. After finishing through contact for an and-one, the Greek forward turned to the home crowd and booed right back, along with two ‘thumbs-down’ gestures. But there was something more brewing underneath.\n\n“Maybe my voice is just a broken record, and guys are just tired,” Antetokounmpo said. “Being a leader is the same thing as being a dad. You’ve got to keep being available, being consistent with your words and your actions, over and over again. And one day, you hope the message is going to go through.” Giannis addressed that the Bucks understand what winning looks like, but they’re simply failing to execute the basics before schemes even matter. It signifies a disconnect between effort, accountability, and urgency, leading to frustrations.\n\nThe post Bucks Source Confirms Giannis Antetokounmpo’s Frustrations in Milwaukee Amid Trade Rumors appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIt's an unfortunate call to action for Stidham, but it also is the biggest game of his life. The upcoming AFC Championship game is the biggest game he's ever played as he's stepping in as the Denver Broncos' starting quarterback after Bo Nix suffered a season-ending ankle injury, marking his first-ever playoff start and a huge opportunity in a high-stakes game.\n\nThe 29-year old quarterback hails from a small town roughly 100 miles west of Dallas, Stephenville, TX. He was a standout in his high school days playing for Stephenville High. He emerged as one of the nation's most sought-after quarterback prospects, earning national attention, transferring south of Stephenville to Baylor in Waco, before later transferring to Auburn.\n\nWith Bo Nix out for the season, Denver’s starting QB for next Sunday’s AFC Championship Game will be Jarrett Stidham. His backup now will be Sam Ehlinger. pic.twitter.com/arNI7Xbv8C\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) January 18, 2026\n\nWhile at Auburn, he led the Tigers to memorable moments, including big wins over SEC rivals Alabama and Georgia in 2017. He led the Tigers to an SEC Championship appearance and earned Second-Team All-SEC honors, becoming the SEC Newcomer of the Year. It was his deep-ball accuracy and skillset that earned him an NFL Draft selection in 2019 by the New England Patriots.\n\nAfter three seasons with the Patriots, he was traded to the Raiders in 2022. He later signed a two-year deal with the Broncos in 2023 and then resigned in 2025. Stidham has spent much of his career as a dependable backup, occasionally stepping in when needed but never fully seizing a starting role. That all changes Sunday, as the Denver Broncos await their possible opponent tomorrow, with both the Houston Texans and New England Patriots making their case for the AFC Championship.

    "title": "Everton at Aston Villa: Opposition Analysis | Outgunned and Depleted Blues Against It",
    "description": "The Toffees must hunker down and battle for everything as they await the return of their star players",
    "fullText": "Everton’s FA Cup penalty shootout defeat to Sunderland last weekend ensured that the club’s quest to end its current silverware drought would extend into a 32nd year. Whilst the manner of the exit left a sour taste, that the Blues lost was not, in itself, a surprise. Shorn of options due to injury, AFCON and suspension, David Moyes was limited in the team he could put out — signalled by the presence on the bench of only one player who’s had senior minutes this season, in Thierno Barry.\n\nThings aren’t going to get better in the short term either, with little action on the transfer front being signalled, and returning players not yet back — though Jack Grealish will be available, having completed a one-match ban. Hopefully, that situation will change by the end of the month, but for this afternoon’s road game against Aston Villa, the Toffees arrive in suboptimal condition.\n\nThe Birmingham outfit were faced with a tight position – with regard to the Premier League’s financial regulations – heading towards this season, and attempted to rectify this by moving out some significant earners, such as Philippe Coutinho and Leon Bailey, along with selling academy product Jacob Ramsey to Newcastle United for a sizeable fee (€45.2m). Several players arrived, though major funds were committed only to the purchase of Nice forward Evan Guessand (€30m), with other reinforcements arriving as loans (Jadon Sancho, Harvey Elliot), or free transfers (Viktor Lindelöf).\n\nThat the veteran former Manchester United centre half has been the one to accrue the most game time so far is indicative of a failed transfer window for Villa. Sancho has been in and out of the side, though has started two of the last four league games, but Elliot is in limbo, having played a combined 174 minutes so far across all competitions. His loan move from Liverpool will be made permanent for an agreed fee of €41m should he make ten league appearances, and Villa have apparently decided that they no longer want the man named player of the tournament during the summer’s Euro 2025 Under-21 tournament.\n\nWhen today’s hosts arrived at Hill Dickinson Stadium early in the season, they’d yet to win a game – or even score a goal – but frustrated Everton in a goalless stalemate, with a negative game plan. A couple more draws followed, but from the end of September the Midlanders embarked on a complete turnaround in form, and have won 19 from 23 in all competitions, including a run of eleven straight, which was ended only by league leaders Arsenal. They await the visitors having dispatched Tottenham Hotspur last weekend, in the FA Cup, and on an eleven game winning streak at Villa Park.\n\nVilla will almost certainly line up in a 4-2-3-1 formation.\n\nEmi Martinez faces a late fitness test, so it’s likely that experienced backup Marco Bizot will deputize. The Dutchman is an able replacement, but is nowhere near on the same level as the World Cup winner. Matty Cash will line up at right back, but on the left former Blue Lucas Digne has been alternating with Ian Maatsen. Since the younger man started against Spurs, it’s likely that the 32-year-old Digne will get the nod today. Ezri Konsa is a lock at centre half, and although Lindelöf has started the last six league games in place of the injured Pau Torres, the Spaniard was back for the cup game last weekend, so may retain his spot.\n\nVilla’s midfield will be without both ex-Toffee Amadou Onana and the excellent Boubacar Kamara, due to injury, but Youri Tielemans will look to orchestrate things from a deep position. Lamare Bogarde was handed a rare start against Everton in September, and will do so again. He’s a solid defensive midfielder, but a significant dropoff compared to Kamara, or Onana. Playing higher up will probably be Morgan Rogers, the team’s joint leading scorer, though John McGinn may do so, if Rogers is deployed wide.\n\nWith Villa having offloaded their only other senior forward, Donyell Malen to Roma a couple of days ago, the hosts will field Ollie Watkins up top. The England striker endured a slow start to the campaign, but has four goals from his last four league outings and offers an all-around package which troubles the best defenders. Unai Emery has several wide options, with Emi Buendia probably deployed on the left, and McGinn the most likely on the right, although Sancho has been starting there recently and Rogers can play anywhere behind the striker.\n\nWith the hosts in imperious form for months, and especially so at Villa Park, this presents a stern test for Everton. Grealish’s availability will give the team more quality on the ball, but otherwise this will be the same side which looked short of goal threat, and were outplayed for long stretches a week ago by a Black Cats side also missing several players due to AFCON. Needless to say, Villa are a considerably stronger proposition, and it’s tough to make much of a case for the visitors, unfortunately.\n\nIn terms of the Everton team, Moyes will likely replace Tyler Dibling – who’s been the target of much criticism from elements of the fan base recently – and move Dwight McNeil once again to right wing, in order to accommodate Grealish. Whilst Dibling has struggled in his last couple of outings, what exactly McNeil offers at this stage, and particularly when fielded on the right, is honestly a mystery. Otherwise, the only change will be Barry in for Beto, with the latter anonymous in the Cup game. Again, one man has a future at Everton, and the other does not. Forgotten man Adam Aznou enjoyed an exciting cameo against Sunderland, but it’s hard to imagine Moyes using the youngster here in any capacity, sadly.\n\nAway from home, the Toffees have fared rather better than at Hill Dickinson, having lost just once (against Chelsea) from six, picking up three wins. Admittedly, most of those games featured players like Iliman Ndiaye, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Idrissa Gueye — none of whom will be present at Villa Park this afternoon, but Everton did score a notable success without any of those against Nottingham Forest. Villa however, are not Forest and Emery is certainly not Sean Dyche. Still, the Blues will set up compactly, give a reasonable account of themselves, and although they’ll end up well beaten, I don’t foresee anything embarrassing.\n\nStatistics provided courtesy of transfermarkt.com and fbref.com",

    "description": "The San Francisco 49ers never had a chance against the Seattle Seahawks in the divisional playoffs. Here are the takeaways.",
    "fullText": "It's hard to put a bow on the San Francisco 49ers' 2025 season because of how messy the entire year was.\n\nPerhaps Saturday's blowout loss in Seattle against the Seahawks perfectly encapsulated the year. The 49ers were overwhelmed from the opening kick as the vastly more talented Seattle roster took over the game early and never stopped.\n\nHere's what we took away from a dreary 49ers performance in the divisional playoffs:\n\nSan Francisco looked like a team that didn't run out of gas, but rather showed up to the game on empty. They got off to a horrendous start and put themselves in a 17-0 hole against a Seattle club that was fresh off its bye week. As the game wore on, the 49ers looked substantially worse and the 17-0 lead turned into a rout. They were never going to stop the avalanche once the game got out of hand.\n\nThe game was effectively over in the first two possessions. Seattle returned the opening kickoff for a touchdown to go ahead 7-0. San Francisco got the ball at the 40 to start their first possession and had a little success moving the ball. They got into a second-and-3, and running back Brian Robinson was stopped short with a two-yard run. On third-and-1 the 49ers lost a yard with a handoff to Christian McCaffrey. Then they tried some trickery with an option play that lost three yards on fourth-and-1. Seattle took the short field and made it 10-0. On the 49ers' next drive they were moving again with Jake Tonges catching a throw for 11 yards on second-and-7, but he fumbled. Seattle took over on the 49ers 43 and cruised in for a touchdown to go ahead 17-0. That was it.\n\nThe game script didn't help the 49ers offense and Purdy for most of the second half was under heavy pressure, but he was also not effective. He missed some key throws, turned the ball over twice, and in general didn't do enough to elevate his club. Injuries matter, but the Seahawks are in the 49ers' division and not going away any time soon. Purdy has to be better moving forward because he was not good enough to keep the game from getting out of hand.\n\nIt looked like the 49ers were going to get on the edge of the red zone when Brock Purdy fired a throw in to Pearsall for a first down on third-and-6 in the second quarter. With the score 17-3, a touchdown on the drive would've made things very interesting. Replay assist ruled the catch an incompletion, however, forcing the 49ers to settle for a 56-yard field goal that trimmed the deficit to 17-6. Field goals were never going to get it done with this 49ers defense.\n\nTonges played well, but the 49ers' offense just has a little less juice when Kittle isn't on the field. His blocking was missed in the run game where the 49ers had a rough time getting to the edge. Purdy was also clearly uncomfortable without his favorite target on the field. Kittle not being on the field wasn't why the 49ers lost, but it was very clear how much he matters for their offense.\n\nThe rookie safety started with Ji'Ayir Brown on the sidelines because of a hamstring injury. Sigle's long stint on the sideline as a reserve came back to bite the 49ers in the biggest game of the year. Sigle got lost on the Seahawks first touchdown, and then got thrown in the blender on their second score before missing a tackle on Kenneth Walker. Saturday night doesn't define him, but it was clear San Francisco's young player who didn't get a ton of burn this year wasn't ready to contribute in a meaningful way.\n\nLuter got flambeed twice in the first half. First, he got cooked by Jaxon Smith-Njigba for a touchdown. Then on a vital third-and-10 late in the first half he was beat bad by Jake Bobo who had only two catches during the regular season. The 49ers probably need to invest in their CB depth in the offseason.\n\nGood for the rookie fourth-round pick. He got in the game early in the third quarter because Christian McCaffrey was on the sideline with a shoulder issue. James took his first-career carry for seven yards. He finished the game with 28 yards on six carries.\n\nWhen the 49ers defense did pop Saturday night it was typically Winters making a play. He racked up nine tackles, including three tackles for loss.\n\nMore 49ers: 49ers superstar named winner of the 2026 Bart Starr Award\n\nThis article originally appeared on Niners Wire: 49ers vs. Seahawks: 7 takeaways, standout players from dreary SF loss",

    "fullText": "Before the Lakers took the court Saturday night, they added two more starters and a key reserve to the injured list. But the Lakers still had LeBron James and they hoped he could carry them past Portland.\n\nStarters Luka Doncic (left groin soreness) and Deandre Ayton (left knee soreness) did not play. In the fourth quarter, Marcus Smart went down amid a pile of players in the lane and eventually limped to the locker room never to return.\n\nAs for James and the rest of the Lakers, all of the injuries were too much to overcome in a 132-116 loss to the Trail Blazers at the Moda Center.\n\nSmart had 25 points before he went to the locker room. James had 20 points but was just six for 16 from the field. He had nine rebounds and eight assists for a Lakers team that has lost five of its last six games.\n\nDrew Timme was a positive for the Lakers, scoring a career-high 21 points. Rui Hachimura and Maxi Kleber each had 11 points.\n\nShaedon Sharpe led Portland (21-22) with 25 points. Jerami Grant and Caleb Love each scored 22 points and Donovan Clingan finished with 18 points and 11 rebounds.\n\nDoncic, who underwent an MRI and is listed as day-to-day, was dealing with the injury all of last week despite playing against the Kings, Hawks and Hornets.\n\n“I think it was an accumulation of a longer week, more lingering, if anything,” Lakers coach JJ Redick said before the game.\n\nThe Lakers (24-16) aren't sure if Ayton will play against Toronto on Sunday. The center is day-to-day with left knee soreness.\n\n“He took a hit in his knee and there was no swelling, just some soreness,” Redick said.\n\nThe Lakers were also without backup center Jaxson Hayes, who didn’t play against the Trail Blazers because of left hamstring tendinopathy. Redick said there's a chance Hayes could play Sunday.\n\nJames missed his first five shots in the first quarter, finishing one-for-seven from the field for just two points.\n\nThe Lakers were called for 13 fouls in the first quarter, leading to 22 free-throw attempts for the Trail Blazers, a big reason why they opened a 40-27 lead after the first 12 minutes of play.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "Seattle's level of domination has set the bar incredibly high for whoever wins the frozen showdown between the Chicago Bears and Los Angeles Rams.",
    "fullText": "Seattle laid its claim for the NFL throne in the exact way it did during its dominant run toward the NFC’s No. 1 seed: by ferociously pummeling their opponent without mercy.\n\nThe Seahawks’ offense had a productive, albeit somewhat ugly game Saturday night against the San Francisco 49ers, but Seattle’s defense (and special teams!) stole the show in this 41-6 divisional round wipeout. Now Seattle is a game away from getting back to the Super Bowl for the first time in over a decade.\n\nIt’s a playoff position star defender DeMarcus Lawrence, who had a strip sack of Brock Purdy late in the second half, hasn’t seen in his career after spending 11 seasons with the Dallas Cowboys. His prophetic words from last March about leaving Dallas for Seattle in free agency made a comeback on social media after the Seahawks’ emphatic win. And they’re bound to have some staying power this coming week as the Seahawks prepare for the NFC title game. But what else stuck out for Lawrence that symbolized this tenacious defense was the new necklace he sported postgame with the initials: MOB.\n\nNew “MOB” necklace for DeMarcus Lawrence looks like it wasn’t free pic.twitter.com/sYP7WASZPE\n\n— Mike Sando (@SandoNFL) January 18, 2026\n\n“Yeah, brand new MOB necklace, man,” Lawrence said. “You know, just letting the world know how we coming, you know.”\n\nIn a league where offenses and quarterbacks are the stars of the show, Seattle has built a defense that’s just as compelling as the biggest, flashiest arms in the NFL and they showed that they’re absolutely good enough to ride to a title.\n\nSeattle didn't even let the 49ers get into the game, doing the same thing it did during the Week 18 regular-season finale when it stifled the 49ers’ running game, which subsequently forced Brock Purdy to be a dropback passer and throw into the teeth of an immovable defense. This weekend, the Seahawks held the 49ers to 28 yards on 11 designed runs in the first half, and again forced the 49ers to play a style of football they don’t want to play.\n\nThe Seahawks forced their second turnover on downs of the night to open the third quarter, the offense rewarded the defense with a field goal and the 21-point deficit was too much against Seattle’s marauding defense.\n\nThis is the kind of performance that No. 1 seeds should have against weaker opponents in their conference. Not that the 49ers are a bad team, they’re just an absurdly injured one. But this level of domination has set the bar incredibly high for whoever wins the frozen showdown between the Chicago Bears and Los Angeles Rams. In a season when head coach Kyle Shanahan had all the answers as the 49ers’ lineups shifted and became more depleted, the Seahawks were all over everything he tried to throw out. Not only are they talented, they’re incredibly well-orchestrated with second-year head coach Mike Macdonald pulling all the strings on defense.\n\nThe 49ers didn’t even reach the red zone in this game and this was an offense that ranked top-three in most standard and advanced metrics over the back half of the season. It’s not like the Seahawks have been padding their stats against the worst teams that the league has to offer. This status is earned through trial. The only offense to put up over 20 points on Seattle over the final nine weeks of the season has been the Rams (the Titans scored 24 but they had a 90-yard punt return touchdown). They’ve given up 75 points since Week 13 with 37 of those points, legitimately half, coming against the Rams.\n\nTeams need to be as dialed in, talented and well-coached as the Rams to really score against this defense. The run the Seahawks are on will go down in the record books as an all-time finish if they can maintain this level of defensive dominance against one of two of the better offenses in the NFL. In the Rams’ case, they’re probably just the flat-out best offense period this season.\n\nThat creates a potentially fascinating third matchup between the Seahawks and their division rival Rams, but L.A. still has to get there first. Caleb Williams and the Bears are no pushover at this point, but when Seattle stuffs Shanahan and the 49ers in a locker for the second time in three weeks, it's hard not to feel like this is the current favorite for the Super Bowl. Seattle’s defense is really that good and it has one of the elite special teams units in the entire league, as shown by Rashid Shaheed’s 95-yard opening kickoff return for a touchdown.\n\nThe health of the Bears or Rams will likely create a tougher test than what the 49ers were able to muster, but this defense is playing as well as a unit possibly can in the modern NFL and the Seahawks seem to be getting better each week. No matter who shows up to face the Seahawks next Sunday, the only thing louder than Lumen Field will be the boom this defense brings seemingly every single play.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nComing into Saturday’s playoff matchup, the Denver Broncos led the NFL in penalty yards, yet discipline was not an issue for Denver. Instead, penalties proved costly for Buffalo.\n\nThe Broncos edged the Bills 33–30 in overtime in the divisional round at Mile High, and flags played a decisive role on the final drive.\n\nOn the possession that set up Wil Lutz’s game-winning field goal, Buffalo was twice called for defensive pass interference. The Bills surrendered 47 penalty yards on that drive alone, allowing Denver to move comfortably down the field for the final points of the game.\n\nMORE: Writing Broncos were disciplined after leading the league in penalties entering the game\n\nTaron Johnson was first flagged for defensive pass interference after tightly covering Courtland Sutton on an incompletion, taking him to the ground as the ball arrived. Whether the call was justified or not, Joey Bosa’s penalty would have given Denver yardage regardless, as the Broncos picked up 17 yards on the play.\n\nThe decisive moment for Buffalo came two plays later. Facing 2nd & 12 and already within long field-goal range, Nix threw deep to Marvin Mims, who was covered by Tre’Davious White. This DPI was more apparent, as White began tackling Mims before the ball arrived.\n\nMORE: Broncos' Jarrett Stidham set for football history not done in NFL since Cowboys' Roger Staubach in 1972\n\nEntering the game, referee Carl Cheffers and his crew were known for calling a higher-than-average number of penalties. Additionally, Denver had been the most penalized team in the league—particularly for defensive pass interference—while Josh Allen had drawn the most penalties that resulted in points. Despite those trends, the Broncos’ secondary remained disciplined, as Denver was flagged just three times for 20 yards in the entire game.\n\nJa'Quan McMillian OT interception: How Broncos cornerback stole ball from Brandin Cooks and saved Denver's season\n\nJa'Quan McMillian OT interception: How Broncos cornerback stole ball from Brandin Cooks and saved Denver's season\n\nExploring 5 wild Broncos QB options including Tom Brady, Cam Newton, Russell Wilson and more after Bo Nix injury\n\nCould Broncos sign Colin Kaepernick?

    "fullText": "Manchester United completely dominated the 198th Manchester derby, eventually emerging 2-0 winners at Old Trafford on Saturday.\n\nIt was Manchester City’s biggest xG loss since Pep Guardiola took charge, and the scoreline could have easily read 5-0 if not for marginal offside calls and the post coming in between twice.\n\nMichael Carrick got his gameplan spot on, with the caretaker head coach playing players in their natural positions.\n\nFor far too long under Ruben Amorim, the team tried to play in a way that deviated from the club’s history.\n\nAt times on Saturday, it was eerily reminiscent of how the Red Devils used to play under Sir Alex Ferguson, keeping things compact at the back before springing on the counter.\n\nEverytime City attacked, they looked even more vulnerable when the possession was turned over. The first goal was the perfect evidence.\n\nUnited legend Peter Schmeichel attested to the fact, claiming to Premier League Productions that Carrick had restored the United DNA in a very short amount of time.\n\n“There was there was no restraint. Go forward. And we saw that in the first goal you had, you know, it’s a defending, it’s a free kick that Harry heads it out, and all of a sudden they’re four against two.\n\n“That’s not something I’ve seen for a very, very long time with Manchester United. But that is what Manchester United is historically always has been able to do.\n\n“You know, as soon as the ball is won, you go forward and you don’t think about what’s going to happen behind you.\n\n“That I think is something they’ve been talking to them about a lot that when you get that opportunity and it was fantastic.”\n\nIt made for stunning viewing for fans, who will be hoping for more of the same next week when the 20-time English league champions take on Arsenal at the Emirates.\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "On the night the San Francisco 49ers' season came to an end with a loss to the Seattle Seahawks in the divisional round of the NFL's postseason, the Golden State Warriors picked up Bay Area sports fans with another impressive victory at home on Saturday evening.\n\nFor the third straight game, the Warriors rolled to another double-digit victory behind sharp shooting from beyond the arc. On Saturday at Chase Center, the Warriors buried 23 3-pointers to surge past the Hornets for a 136-116 win. Seven different members of the Warriors drilled two or more 3-pointers.\n\nDe'Anthony Melton led the Warriors again, scoring a team-high 24 points off the bench on 8-of-16 shooting from the field and 3-of-6 from beyond the arc with six rebounds and three assists in 21 minutes. Melton has now scored 22 or more points in three of his last six games. The Warriors are 5-1 over that span. In games Melton has been in the lineup this season, the Warriors have posted an 11-6 record.\n\nMoses Moody knocked down four 3-pointers on his way to 12 points in 27 minutes. Draymond Green added 20 points on 8-of-14 shooting with four made 3-pointers. Brandin Podziemski stayed hot, scoring 16 points on 5-of-9 shooting with a trio of made 3-pointers in 30 minutes off the bench.\n\nSteph Curry, Buddy Hield and Al Horford each knocked down a pair of triples on Saturday against the Hornets.\n\nThe Warriors made franchise history on Saturday night at Chase Center. For the first time in franchise history, the Warriors have made at least 20 3-pointers in three straight games.\n\nAlong with winning three straight games, the Warriors have won five of six games on their current eight-game home stand. The Warriors have posted an 11-4 record over their last 15 games.\n\nWith a 24-19 record, the Warriors will put their three-game win streak on the line on Monday when the Miami Heat come to Chase Center.\n\nThis post originally appeared on Warriors Wire! \n\nThis article originally appeared on Warriors Wire: Warriors stay hot at home, roll past Hornets on Saturday, 136-116",

    "title": "Obituary: Former Sunderland Defender Alan Black",
    "description": "Roker Report pays tribute to former player Alan Black, who passed away earlier this week.",
    "fullText": "Everybody at Roker Report was saddened to learn of the death of former Sunderland player Alan Black, who passed away recently at the age of 82. The following is an updated version of an article that was originally published in 2024 to celebrate his 81st birthday…\n\nHaving joined from Dumbarton Alan Black provided cover mainly for club stalwart Len Ashurst, which in turn enabled John Parke to take over from the injured Cec Irwin, yet the sixties signing didn’t disgrace himself in Sunderland colours and would go on to enjoy a more prominent role at his next destination.\n\nBorn in June 1943, Black grew up in Alexandria – the same western Scotland town as Bobby Kerr. Having begun at Drumchapel Amateurs, as a youngster he turned down the opportunity to play for Blackpool and opted to remain at semi-professional Dumbarton instead so that he could continue his engineering apprenticeship. Once his studies were done though he accepted the offer of a month-long trial at Roker and before it was even complete had agreed to leave the Sons and join the Lads on a permanent basis.\n\nMoving in September 1964 when the board were overseeing the majority of first team affairs prior to the appointment of George Hardwick, Black made his debut the following February with something of a baptism of fire, but despite facing a Manchester United side that included the great ‘Trinity’ of Bobby Charlton, Denis Law and George Best, he helped secure a clean sheet and narrow victory against the Red Devils – fellow Scot Harry Hood getting the only goal in front of a 51,000 strong crowd.\n\nThree days later Sunderland were in the capital to play Fulham and despite defeat he gave a solid showing. This was to be Black’s last game of 1964-65 however, and it wasn’t until October that he resurfaced, deputising for Ashurst once again in another away match at West Bromwich Albion.\n\nNow working under his countryman Ian McColl, he followed that up with another appearance seven days later, when he came on for the injured Jimmy Montgomery in the last few minutes of a thrilling win over Nottingham Forest. Martin Harvey went in goal in place of Monty, with Black slotting into the defence after becoming only the second ever substitute in a competitive Sunderland fixture – he may have also been involved in midweek too had the League Cup permitted substitutes, as fellow Parke was forced to limp on in a tie against Aston Villa despite taking a heavy whack.\n\nThere were to be two more outings for Black during the campaign, both coming away from home in a draw at Sheffield United and then a during a defeat to Liverpool. Having played the full 90 at Bramall Lane he then came on from the bench again on Merseyside the following weekend, and whilst the Lads were already trailing when introduced this proved to be his final game for the club.\n\nBlack left Sunderland a little over a week before the 2nd anniversary of him signing full time. One of several reserves that McColl was willing to part with as he looked to raise funds for incoming deals, the £9,000 Norwich City forked out soon looked like good business – their new arrival debuting later that evening in a 2-1 win at Northampton Town. His Canaries bow proved to be a good precursor to the rest of his time at Carrow Road too, where he became a crowd favourite and featured in the Division Two championship winning season of 1971-72.\n\nAfter playing over 200 times for the team, including five instances of him lining up against Sunderland, Black returned to Dumbarton in 1973 but was soon forced to retire due to knee problems. The Norwich title win, which had included a return to Wearside during the run in for a 1-1 draw, meant the club had reached the topflight for the first time – a feat that contributed towards Black subsequently being inducted into their Hall of Fame and gladly accepting many subsequent invites back to Norfolk.\n\nIt was in his native Dumbartonshire region though where he lived, remaining there once his football career was over and making use of his familiarity with the area by becoming a taxi driver. Rest in peace Alan, and best wishes to his loved ones from all at Roker Report.\n\n*The photograph at the start of this piece shows Alan celebrating the Durham Challenge Cup that he won whilst playing for Sunderland reserves during 1965-66. The team beat West Auckland 3-2 in the final at Darlington and alongside him are Keenan (l) and Campbell (r).",

    "fullText": "I thought Hume played very well.\n\nWhenever people discuss a predicted team, it’s Hume that gets the push. He’s not always guaranteed his right back berth but it’s not a problem as he can slot in at left back or more recently, in midfield. He was also the creator of a few deft moves and had one or two chances himself.\n\nYou can’t keep Northern Ireland’s man of the moment down. Mentions as always for Nordi Mukiele, Granit Xhaka and Enzo Le Fée, but I was impressed with Hume.\n\nAnother victory from a losing position — epitomised by Brian Brobbey, who got his usual battering but kept on going and got a very deserved goal.\n\nThis team doesn’t give up. Big hearts, big engines and big desire.\n\nWe were very open at the back, especially in the early stages of the first half.\n\nCrystal Palace had several breaks that on another day could have seen us 0-2 down before we got going. Luckily, as usual, Régis Le Bris and the team sorted it out and we became more solid and more assured.\n\nThe first few home games this season had most people staying until the final whistle, but the early leavers are back.\n\nThey stop in the gangways and block people’s view, then everyone has to stand. It’s a free country, but does anyone leave the theatre or cinema early?\n\nAn amazing winner from Brobbey underlined his value to our team.\n\nHe battled throughout, showing his strength and skill. It’s really important to have the outlet that the big Dutchman provides — and the finish off the underside of the bar was truly remarkable.\n\nThis was another game during which nobody could be faulted for their performance, and the team we support is so much more than a group of talented individuals.\n\nWe have players that genuinely care about the city, the fans, and where we finish in this league.\n\nI love that about these players — they sweat blood for each other and that’s very reassuring.\n\nIs there a pattern developing that to start dominating home games, we need to go behind? Six of the eleven home games have followed this script.\n\nOur head coach has a Ph.D. in sports performance so he may have some insights he can share. As a fan, I find it quite relaxing to follow home games, with two rules: A. Don’t worry if we concede first, and B. We’re not going to lose anyway.\n\nThis is an amazing way to enjoy and take in matches.\n\nI can’t come up with anything negative. This was a much-needed and deserved victory; we’re getting our best players back and it all bodes well for the rest of the season.\n\nHappy times to be a Sunderland fan.\n\nHistorically, going 0-1 down at home would be the beginning of the end.\n\nHowever, this team is different and the resilience demonstrated to not just get back into the game but to then go on and win it was admirable. What certainly helps, though, is the crowd, as nobody was getting on the players’ backs when we conceded.\n\nInstead, there was an encouraging roar and it helped solidify our unbeaten home form.\n\nConsidering that we signed Brobbey on deadline day, it’s incredible to think that he’s turning into one of our most important signings of the transfer window.\n\nHis strength and ability to pin in three centre backs is undoubtedly a huge reason why we got three points this afternoon — and that’s without even talking about the finish, which was absolutely sublime.\n\nA class footballer and I can’t wait to see how he continues to develop.\n\nI can’t help but feel that at times, that we’re in a time machine and have been transported back to League One when it comes to referees. The “main event” energy that’s surrounded the last few officials has been suitably minging to watch.\n\nIf there’s one thing that’s bound to get on the collective tits of everyone at the Stadium of Light, it’s inconsistency.\n\nThis referee personified that and some of the decisions that Jean-Philippe Mateta was able to get compared to Brobbey was just ridiculous.\n\nWhen we’re 2-1 up in a close game, I find it baffling that anybody would leave.\n\nWe ask the team to give 100% until the final whistle and given that we just have to sit there, it’s not difficult to ask for everyone to stay until the game ends, not least of all to give the team the credit and appreciation they deserve after such a fantastic performance.\n\nOur big number nine was my man of the match. His hold-up play got us up the park and his battle with the Palace defenders rarely went their way.\n\nHow he managed to score a goal by putting the ball over the keeper and under the bar is beyond me.\n\nAnother great performance, with a goal and a hell of a shift put in.\n\nThe man covers every blade of grass on the pitch and is as strong in defence as he is in attack\n\nAfter his panenka nightmare, he’s recovered and kicked on massively — and the love for Le Fée is clear from the songs we all sing.\n\nThe chances for Brobbey and Trai Hume earlier in the game should’ve been converted — both great moments for us but not taken advantage of.\n\nWe didn’t suffer from that lack of clinical finishing, but on another day, we may have done.\n\nThe gaffer left it until about ten minutes before the end before putting any fresh legs on.\n\nGiven the way we harried and pressed Palace, we may have closed the game out sooner with fresh limbs, but what do I know that the French professor doesn’t?\n\nI’m clutching for a second “down”, because to be honest, there aren’t many options.\n\nThe Stadium of Light is still a fortress. We’re the comeback kings — and we’re in the top eight and above the scum.\n\nNot sure it gets a lot better than that.\n\nBrobbey was fouled all game and got no protection from the referee, but ultimately had the last laugh by scoring a winner which had people scratching their heads asking “How did he do that?”.\n\nHe was a handful from start to finish; a proper, old-fashioned centre-forward, bullying the Palace defence. His footwork was a little awry in the first half, as he had a few chances where the ball got under his feet.\n\nHowever, his persistence paid off with a fabulous winner in the 71st minute, as he dinked the ball into the net from five yards out.\n\nHow did we pick him up for such a ridiculous fee?\n\n£9.5 million plus add-ons seems like absolute daylight robbery for a player who provided the assist for Enzo Le Fée’s opening goal and should’ve been awarded a penalty when Romaine Mundle was bundled over in the penalty area when he received another cross from Mukiele.\n\nMukiele and Brobbey were given yellow cards for telling the ref to stop the constant and persistent fouling by Palace’s defence.\n\nBrobbey was constantly being fouled and manhandled — so much so that I got a little concerned that he might be provoked into kicking out. Thankfully, he kept his head and had the last laugh, but the referee had to give our players better protection. He also missed a stonewall penalty as Romaine Mundle was bundled down in the box after receiving a cross from Nordi Mukiele.\n\nGranit Xhaka turned in an uncharacteristically hesitant display in the middle of the park and almost gifted Palace an opener.\n\nWe looked indecisive and tentative at times, but things improved in the second half as Régis Le Bris had looked quite annoyed as he headed down the tunnel for the half time break.",

    "fullText": "After two weeks of back-page murmurs and speculation, Sunderland finally ‘joined the chat’ in the January transfer market, announcing the acquisition of Jocelin Ta Bi — a reportedly crafty winger from Israeli side Maccabi Netanya.\n\nFashionably going by his first name on the back of his shirt, à la trendsetters ‘Virgil’ van Dijk, as well as most of the Brazilian national side, the forward has averted any prospective mix-up with our other right-winger Chemsdine Talbi, much to the relief of commentary teams across the land.\n\nThis Christian-name-on-back-of-shirt fad had me thinking: imagine our entire squad followed suit, all in the name of self-promotion and personal brand.\n\nWe’d have a trio of Brian, Simon, and Wilson leading the line – names of middle-aged fellas you’d find perusing the Daily Mail down at any Wetherspoons, lapping up the latest Reform UK drivel. Not forgetting their mate, Dennis, who, unlike the rest of them, still has all his hair and teeth.\n\nYet, perhaps the best of the lot would be the outgoing Blondy. Presumably, a player named after either Debbie Harry or his definitely-not-dyed peroxide hair.\n\nAnyway, enough on player first names and more on Saturday’s game with Crystal Palace: a side who ended last season with an FA Cup triumph, and started this campaign with a Community Shield win and European qualification.\n\nOn paper a very solid outfit, but contextually anything but. They are a club seemingly in free-fall, with stalwart Marc Guéhi poised to join Manchester City, while boss Oliver Glasner tendered his resignation in midweek.\n\nThat said, while Régis Le Bris has worked wonders in distancing us from that Sunderland-y reputation that once preceded us, Yeremy Pino’s opener following our pretty solid start was very on-brand for the Sunderland of old.\n\nThere were several dips in concentration, with Robin Roefs being called into action on a few occasions, including to deny Jean-Philippe Mateta early on. A rare defensive lapse saw Palace’s only real creative outlet on the day, deftly place it beyond Roefs. It was a pretty sloppy goal to concede, made more frustrating by the fact that it was straight from a set-piece.\n\nNevertheless, this is ‘New Sunderland’. We are a side whose heads are incapable of dropping, and as a result, seem to almost be galvanised by conceding.\n\nIt took just three minutes for Enzo Le Fée to restore parity. Following an intricate bit of interplay down our left side, the Frenchman guided Nordi Mukiele’s low-driven cross into the bottom corner with effortless finesse.\n\nAfter the break, there was only one team out to win it. Our second-half display really exhibited us at our very best; defensively solid, tenacious in midfield, and potent in the transition.\n\nIn the 71st minute, Noah Sadiki’s line-splitting through-ball put Brian Brobbey in on goal, and with a sublime stroke of his right boot, our £20 million Dutchman half-scooped-half-thumped it over Dean Henderson, who was left helpless as the ball satisfyingly sailed in off the bar. 2-1.\n\nWhile our visitors probed in the dying embers, we remained dogged at the back, and could so very easily have made it three via a sumptuous back-to-front move which ultimately saw Trai Hume clip the top of the crossbar.\n\nWith three points under our belt, breaking the string of five games without a win, and protecting our unbeaten home record, this was another superb afternoon on Wearside.\n\nRumour has it that Brobbey would not have had to be surgically removed from his back if he had not been substituted, as Maxence Lacroix would have had to be removed due to the defender’s persistent, unpunished fouling of our number nine.\n\nBrobbey cramping up after his goal was actually due to the fact he had been supporting the body mass of two men all game.\n\nAlthough Granit Xhaka had a poor afternoon by his impeccably high standards, I was, once again, left speechless by the collective effort of the team. From Mukiele’s marauding runs down the centre of the pitch, Noah Sadiki’s unrelenting press, and Le Fée’s class to Omar Alderete’s trivela cross, I thought there were standout moments for all involved.\n\nA victory that propels us up to eighth, three points off fourth and back above those lot up the road (even if it’s only temporarily) — the boys in red and white have delivered once more.",

    "fullText": "We normally drive up from Yorkshire for home games but, for a variety of reasons, I attended the game against Crystal Palace on my own. A quick check of rail fares meant that the Grand Central return ticket was less than £20 (courtesy of being an old git with a Senior railcard) so, accompanied by a Sainsbury’s meal deal and a couple of cans of JD and Coke, I took the relaxing option to head north.\n\nArriving in Sunderland, I followed the crowds heading for the Keel Crossing. It has been several years since I made the journey from the city centre to the SoL on foot and, for someone who grew up in Seaburn and Roker in the 60s, when the sides of the Wear were dominated by the shipyards of Austin & Pickersgill, Doxfords and others, it was something of a revelation!\n\nAs I headed towards the recently opened bridge, the evidence of redevelopment was all around me. New buildings and sites surrounded by Heras fencing, awaiting construction, were everywhere.\n\nThe new bridge afforded a wonderful view of the iconic Wearmouth Bridge, through the crowds of supporters making their way to the game, whilst the Stadium of Light itself appeared even more imposing in the distance, from an angle I have never approached it from before. At the other end of the bridge, much of the derelict buildings that had blighted the area for so long have either been refurbished or replaced – the tasteful redevelopment of the historic Sheepfolds Stables is particularly impressive. Of course, the area has been neglected for decades, and there is still much work to be done.\n\nThe return journey in the dark, with the opposite bank of the bridge all lit up, around City Hall, was the perfect illustration of how bright the future of the city is looking.\n\nIn between, there was the small matter of a fixture against Crystal Palace, who should have been in disarray after the loss of captain Marc Guéhi and the announcement that Oliver Glasner would leave at the end of the season. It proved to be far from the case, with the physically imposing Jean-Philippe Mateta proving a real handful for Dan Ballard. The French striker hit the back of the net with a beautiful piece of control leading to a lethal strike, only to see his effort ruled offside.\n\nAt the opposite end of the pitch, Brian Brobbey must have thought he had mistakenly wandered into an MMA cage, as he was repeatedly pushed, pulled, and held without evoking any interest from referee Rob Jones.\n\nA failure to clear the lines after a corner – which came after Jones awarded a contentious free-kick to the away side – led to Palace opening the scoring, and it looked like the Lads were in for a difficult afternoon. But, with Enzo Le Fée pushing up closer to Brobbey, a well-worked cross from Nordi Mukiele found the mercurial little Frenchman. The defenders were already drawn towards Brobbey, leaving Enzo to stroke the ball home emphatically to level the scores, before half-time.\n\nSunderland started the second half much more aggressively. As the rough treatment of Brobbey continued, referee Jones’ already limited control of the game threatened to disappear altogether, in a flurry of yellow cards. But the burly Dutch striker would have the last laugh. Noah Sadiki burst forward, driving at the Palace defence before chipping the ball towards Brobbey. Just as he had done against Arsenal, he deftly flicked the ball over the advancing goalkeeper and into the net, before collapsing with cramp into the advertising hoardings, in front of a delirious home end.\n\nSunderland continued to press and Trai Hume was denied by Henderson and the bar, much to my disappointment as I had a bet on the Irishman to score!\n\nMayenda replaced the tiring Brobbey and as Palace pushed forward unsuccessfully in search of an equaliser, both he and Dan Ballard were denied from close range by Dean Henderson. Dennis Cirkin replaced Romaine Mundle in the dying minutes – the young winger having shown that he is adapting to the demands of Premier League football, linking up effectively with Sadiki and Reinildo on the left, and contributing defensively. Chemsdine Talbi is due back after the AFCON final but he has had little game time in the past few weeks, so having other options is essential for Le Bris.\n\nThere was a particularly significant moment as the players left the field. Normally the celebrating fans sing in praise of Granit Xhaka – instead the strains of ‘We’ve got Le Fée’ rang out in unison, his misfortune in the Brentford game banished to the annals of history. Afterwards, he spoke about how important the support of the crowd meant to him, a salutary reminder of how much we react as fans can impact our players.\n\nAnother comeback win, up to eighth place in the League, unbeaten at home, another three points on the board and just seven more needed in 16 games to reach the magic 40-point mark – all in all, a very satisfactory afternoon’s work by the Lads. For a returning son of the city, it was equally pleasing to see the upturn in the area which surrounds the Stadium of Light.\n\nAs I headed home, I was left with one overriding impression – Sunderland AFC and the city the club calls home are marching together in lockstep towards a long-overdue renaissance in their fortunes.",

    "description": "One confirmed exit and several unresolved situations have left Barça navigating a familiar balancing act.",
    "fullText": "FC Barcelona are used to conversations about patience when it comes to young midfielders. This winter, that patience is being tested from several angles at once.\n\nThe most jarring case is that of Dro Fernández. The 18-year-old has opted to trigger his €6m release clause this January, a move that caught those inside the Ciutat Esportiva off guard. His departure is particularly stinging because his trajectory under Hansi Flick was pointing upward. Flick took him on the preseason tour, handed him a senior debut, and trusted him with starts against high-level opposition like Atlético Madrid.\n\nFlick was reportedly “furious” to learn of the decision. Recently, he said it was one of the biggest disappointments in his life, as Deco had been working behind the scenes to secure a renewal. But the outside interest proved too much, and the decision is already made. Dro has agreed a move to Paris Saint-Germain, bringing a swift conclusion to months of speculation.\n\nDro’s exit may not be the last for Barcelona’s midfielders. For Marc Casadó, the situation remains complicated. Despite being one of Flick’s early success stories, even earning a Spain call-up, the return of Frenkie de Jong has pushed Casadó to the side. The youngster’s role has shrunk. This season he has logged 871 minutes across 19 appearances, starting 10 times and being substituted at half time on two occasions.\n\nLast summer, Barcelona were prepared to entertain a €30m offer from West Ham, only for Flick to intervene. Now, the player’s own stance has shifted.\n\nAccording to Marca, Casadó is increasingly open to a move to protect his spot in Luis de la Fuente’s Spain squad ahead of the World Cup. Atlético Madrid are watching closely. Flush with cash from the €40m sale of Conor Gallagher to Tottenham, Diego Simeone is looking for midfield reinforcements, and Casadó fits the profile.\n\nMarc Bernal presents a more nuanced case. After losing a year to a cruciate ligament injury just as the Flick era began, his return in September has been handled with caution. With only 273 minutes across 12 appearances, Bernal was considered a potential candidate for a January loan. Girona emerged as a primary suitor.\n\nHowever, a recent Copa del Rey start against Racing Santander may have changed things. Bernal played an hour, and despite the physical toll, the experience was enough to convince him he can still contribute at Barça. Mundo Deportivo reports that Bernal is now leaning toward staying.\n\nDe Jong and Pedri remain locked as the starters in the midfield two, plus there’s Gavi’s return in the long run. And with Fermín López and Dani Olmo vying for the spot behind the striker, a place also sometimes occupied by Raphinha, it’s not easy to get minutes there, either.\n\nHaving already lost one young midfielder to the transfer market, Barcelona will be eager not to lose any more.",

    "description": "Phil West looks at the main stories from the Lads’ victory over the Eagles — an impressive and key win!",
    "fullText": "After a Christmas and New Year run that hardly represented a “slump” but was marked by one or two less-than-convincing displays and culminated in a disappointing defeat at the hands of Brentford, this felt like an ideal opportunity for the Lads to rediscover the winning habit, given that our immediate run of fixtures feels extremely favourable and could essentially see Sunderland edge over the safety line with ample room to spare.\n\nDoubtless reinvigorated by last weekend’s FA Cup success and with Noah Sadiki and Reinildo returning to the Stadium of Light following their AFCON odyssey, Régis Le Bris’ men recovered from the concession of a strange-looking goal from Yéremy Pino to overturn the deficit with strikes from Enzo Le Fée and Brian Brobbey, and adding to an ever-growing list of Crystal Palace problems in the process, with manager Oliver Glasner already on the way out and captain Marc Guéhi seemingly bound for Manchester City.\n\nAhead of the game, I felt the visitors from south London weren’t to be underestimated — this division has a habit of punishing such mindsets — but despite falling behind, it was hard not to be impressed with the resilience and focus demonstrated by Sunderland, and after an energetic, potent and generally dominant second half display, we ran out as deserved winners against a side for whom choppy waters may lie ahead.\n\nIf the signing of the powerful Dutchman from Ajax represented something of a gamble during the summer transfer window, he’s starting to repay the transfer fee and then some, because this was as dynamic, impactful and downright brutal a display as I’ve seen from a Sunderland striker in years.\n\nIt wasn’t just the goal (itself a very well-taken second half strike that gave us a lead we would never relinquish) — it was the way he set about the visiting defence, rarely letting them settle, holding the ball up and bringing his teammates into play — as well as taking more than his fair share of the lumps along the way.\n\nTo my eyes at least, Brobbey seems to relish such battles and when he left the pitch to a standing ovation late in the second half, it felt as much in response to his all-round display and the sheer workload he’d blasted through as it did for what proved to be the winning goal.\n\nHe’s looking ever more like a perfect fit for this side and he’s becoming a very popular figure with the red and white faithful. Keep going, Brian!\n\n“You want a response? I’ll give you a response!”\n\nOK, perhaps I’m being presumptuous and putting words into the mouth of the French magician but after recent events and all that talk about how he “owed us” (he didn’t, by the way), why should we not celebrate the fact that this sublimely gifted footballer both plays for and has clearly taken to life at Sunderland AFC as much as any other player in the squad?\n\nHe slotted home the equaliser following a sharp Sunderland break and as is generally the case every time he takes to the field, he was more or less everywhere, carrying his share of the load in both attack and defence — importantly so, because Granit Xhaka and Noah Sadiki weren’t at their best yesterday — which went a long way towards the eventual victory.\n\nIf I was a young Sunderland fan, I’d be starry-eyed when watching Le Fée. As it is, I’m thirty six, I’m increasingly grumpy and I don’t move very quickly — and I’m still starry-eyed when I watch Le Fée. He’s just so good.\n\nHe got a warm reception when he came out to warm up and as Régis Le Bris has previously disclosed, Neil remains a professional presence within the home dressing room at the Stadium of Light, but it’s also hard to escape the reality that this chapter appears to be drawing to a close and that the former skipper will soon be moving on to pastures new.\n\nSunderland AFC is now a very different club to the organization that Neil played such a key role in restoring to its place among the elite of English football, but if this was the latest waypoint on his long goodbye to Wearside, there was no hint of bad feelings or bitterness, and in an era when players often don’t think twice about throwing tantrums if things don’t work out behind the scenes, that says something about Neil’s approach to football and his respect for our club.",

    "description": "Mick Buxton’s Sunderland needed a replay plus extra time to overcome their FA Cup foes.",
    "fullText": "Having played, rather infamously, in 1974 and then as recently as 2014, Sunderland and Carlisle United are no strangers to FA Cup meet ups. The clubs were even drawn against each other for two years running in 1994 and 1995, with both ties having to be settled via replays at Brunton Park – the first instance of which took place on this day.\n\nA hard-fought draw earlier in the month On This Day (8 January 1994): Buxton’s Boys look to avenge Stokoe’s Stars | Roker Report meant the sides had to do it all again in Cumbria, where heavy rain and a rapid frost thaw had left the pitch in a less than ideal condition. Nevertheless, referee Roger Dilkes was happy for the match to start having carried out an inspection earlier in the day, although the arrival of strong winds come kick-off did make the already difficult conditions even more tricky to cope with.\n\nThe weather proved to be a factor in not only the game itself, but Mick Buxton’s team selection also; young forward Craig Russell had picked up a knock at the weekend during Sunderland’s game against Middlesbrough, and having taken the playing surface into consideration the manager felt that Lee Howey’s more physical approach would be better suited. Howey was on a high anyway having scored the header that had settled the Wear Tees clash, and with Don Goodman and Gordon Armstrong already sidelined through injury the last thing the squad needed was to lose Russell for a period by forcing him into a prolonged slog on a mud bath.\n\nRussell was instead brought on to see out Sunderland’s passage into the next round having just seen them take the lead, although it had been a long time coming admittedly. Despite Carlisle’s Division Three status they dominated the first half, and having already given the Lads a scare on Wearside they looked a decent bet going into the break. Simon Davey and David Reeves both looked dangerous, whilst Rod Thomas was also a threat, but they were unable to find a breakthrough and as time marched on the visitors came on strong.\n\nSince Buxton had replaced Terry Butcher in November Sunderland had only lost twice, and their new found resilience meant the Blues eventually ran out of steam before being forced to sit back. A quality move involving Gary Owers, Richard Ord and Phil Gray led to a period of pressure after an hour and ten minutes later Gray came within a fraction of scoring having been put through by Brian Atkinson. Still, it needed extra time before the crucial goal, with Howey sweeping an Ord knockdown from a Martin Smith corner into the net to send the away support behind the goal wild.\n\nThe 4,000 or so travelling fans made up around a third of the total attendance, and a number of them ended up on the pitch amidst the celebrations. His decision to pick Howey vindicated, Buxton brought Russell on shortly after the action had recommenced – meaning that the ‘Jarra Arra’ could now run at a tired defence in the closing stages and look to keep possession well away from his own goal. The tactic worked a treat and whilst it might have been a grind at times it was enough to give Sunderland their first FA Cup victory over Carlisle, who 20 years earlier had been the ones to bring their defence of the trophy to an abrupt end.\n\nSunderland: Chamberlain; Owers, Bennett, Melville, Ord; Atkinson (Russell 106’), Ferguson, Ball, Smith; Howey, P.

Following the arrivals of summer signings Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, and Benjamin Sesko, he found himself at the bottom of Ruben Amorim’s attacking pecking order, only earning a starting role when some of his teammates were missing due to injuries.\n\nThe former Bologna star was hoping to make a good first impression on the new Man Utd boss, Michael Carrick, but he wasn’t even in the matchday squad for the Derby victory over Man City.\n\nESPN journalist Rob Dawson revealed that the striker’s absence is due to a knock he received in training earlier this week.\n\nIn addition to providing updates on the player’s condition, Dawson also revealed that the Netherlands international could still end up leaving Man Utd before the end of January. This was also echoed by Dutch journalist Joost Blaauwhof.\n\n“Joshua Zirkzee is missing from the Manchester derby due to injury,” he posted on his X account.\n\n“The striker is sidelined for a short period and could already have played his last match at Old Trafford if action in Italy picks up soon. The possibility of that is considerable. The Manchester United striker is reportedly keen on joining AS Roma.”\n\n(Photo by Michael Regan/Getty Images)\n\nZirkzee’s possible move to Roma has been well-documented over the past few months, as the Italian capital side has been keen to add him to Gian Piero Gasperini’s ranks.\n\nBut according to Sky Sport Italia journalist Gianluca Di Marzio, the Giallorossi could have company in the race, as Juventus are also considering a move.\n\nThe transfer market insider insists that the Turin-based giants are determined to sign Crystal Palace bomber Jean-Philippe Mateta, who has also been on Man Utd’s shortlist, but they have identified Zirkzee as a fallback option.\n\nIt should be noted that Carrick decided to drop Sesko from the starting lineup on his debut, which could spell further bad news for the already-frustrated Zirkzee.\n\nThe English head coach is seemingly in favour of fielding Mbeumo in the No.9 role to make room for Amad Diallo on the right wing. The Cameroonian responded well to the change, scoring the all-important opener against Man City.\n\nIf this trend continues, Zirkzee might find himself third in line for the striker role in a season where United hardly need extra depth due to the lack of commitments. Therefore, the Dutchman might soon be marked as surplus to requirements, opening the door for a return to Italy.",

    "description": "The Lakers were very short-handed on Saturday versus the Trail Blazers, and they ended up losing again by a wide margin.",
    "fullText": "The day before the Los Angeles Lakers' Saturday matchup against the Portland Trail Blazers, Luka Doncic was ruled out due to groin soreness. Prior to the opening tip of that game, they got more bad news when it was revealed that starting center Deandre Ayton and backup center Jaxson Hayes also wouldn't play.\n\nWith Austin Reaves still sidelined due to a gastrocnemius strain, the Lakers were in a very difficult situation against a Portland team that had won eight of its last 11 games.\n\nLos Angeles was competitive early, but a 15-2 Trail Blazers run put them up 40-27 at the end of the first quarter. They shot a whopping 22 free throws in the first quarter, and in general, that first period set the tone for the entire evening.\n\nThe Lakers were never able to mount a serious challenge, as they ended up losing, 132-116. It was their fifth loss in their last six games and their 12th loss in their last 21 contests, as well as the second game in a row they gave up over 130 points.\n\nThey simply got outclassed in almost every category. They let Portland shoot 52.3% from the field and 38.1% from 3-point range, and they got outrebounded by 15 while giving up 27 second-chance points. It's becoming a broken record for the Lakers — they continue to put up a weak level of resistance defensively while often getting outplayed in the effort categories.\n\nThey now have a 24-16 record and remain in sixth place in the Western Conference, and they're just half a game ahead of the seventh-place Phoenix Suns.\n\nSmart did plenty to give the Lakers a chance to win this game, at least offensively. He took 17 shot attempts, which was a new season high for him, and made nine of them while going 4-of-6 from 3-point range, giving him a team-high 25 points. He also had two rebounds and one steal, but he had no assists in 25 minutes.\n\nThe Lakers needed an all-hands-on-deck effort, especially offensively, in this game, but LaRavia didn't pull his weight. He got off only two shot attempts and missed both of them, and he scored just two points on free throws. In 28 minutes, he contributed five rebounds, four assists and one steal.\n\nKleber has barely scored or even looked to score this season, but early on, he was aggressive offensively. He scored nine points in the first quarter and ended up with 11 points on 4-of-8 field-goal shooting, and he also had five rebounds, one assist and one steal in 21 minutes.\n\nVincent wasn't able to give L.A. much, if anything, on offense. He missed all but one of his six shot attempts and ended up with three points and one assist in 23 minutes.\n\nJames was 1-of-7 in the first quarter and 3-of-12 in the first half, and while he shot somewhat better afterward, he never truly got it going. He finished with 20 points on 6-of-16 shooting from the field, although he did make all seven of his free throw attempts. James did help out with nine rebounds, eight assists, two blocks and one steal.\n\nHachimura made a nice offensive contribution off the bench in 19 minutes. He made four of his seven shot attempts to score 11 points, to go along with one rebound, one assist and two steals.\n\nIn 18 minutes, Vanderbilt made all three of his shots to score six points and added two rebounds, one assist and one block.\n\nTimme, a 6-foot-10 power forward who is on a two-way contract, had a fantastic outing and made the most of his 29 minutes of playing time. He shot 9-of-12 overall and 3-of-4 from downtown, giving him 21 points, and he mixed it up well by scoring deep in the paint and also hitting from the perimeter. He also had four assists, two rebounds and two steals.\n\nAt times, Bufkin hustled well on defense, resulting in two blocks, and on the other end of the floor, he made three of his eight shot attempts, giving him nine points in 22 minutes. He also chipped in one rebound and one assist.\n\nSmith got 10 minutes of playing time on Saturday and finished with five points on 2-of-3 shooting and three assists.\n\nKnecht played five minutes and hit a 3-pointer, while the younger James got eight minutes on the court and missed both of his shot attempts while notching one assist.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Lakers player grades: L.A. loses big in Portland while short-handed",

    "title": "Top Seahawks takeaways from 41-6 blowout Divisional Round playoff game",
    "description": "What stood out the most for Seattle?",
    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks dismantled the San Francisco 49ers in literally every phase of the game. In fact, this was tied for their most dominant playoff victory of all time, right alongside Super Bowl XLVIII.\n\nSeattle began the game with a bang, thanks to Rashid Shaheed's 95-yard kick return touchdown. From there, they never let their foot of the pedal for the remainder of the contest. The Seahawks ended San Francisco's season, and now they get to host the NFC Championship for the fourth time ever... and the first since the 2014 season. As always, we at Seahawks Wire take you through the top takeaways from each game, and we aren't slowing down now!\n\nOne game is one thing. Two is another. Three, and now four, is officially a pattern. Saturday night marked the fourth-straight game the Seahawks have rushed for at 160+ yards as a team. Against the 49ers, Seattle bulldozed their way to 175 on 33 carries. Leading the way was Kenneth Walker III, who had 116 of those yards and all three rushing touchdowns from the night. Backup Zach Charbonnet did leave the game with an injury and was unable to return, but head coach Mike Macdonald seemed optimistic about initial results.\n\nSam Darnold has been battling negative bias from the media and opposing fans all season long. This stems from how poorly he played in the Vikings' last two games to conclude the 2024 campaign - blowout losses in Week 18 and the Wild Card. Darnold proved doubters wrong with wins over the Rams and Niners to close out the 2025 season, but doubts persisted, especially with his sudden oblique issue landing him on the injury report. Darnold was totally solid on Saturday. He may not have blown anyone away, but with how this team is playing, completing 12-of-17 passes for 124 yards and a touchdown (a spectacular one at that!) is more than enough to keep the Seahawks competitive. Darnold will most assuredly continue to face these questions, although there may be less of them going into the NFC Championship.\n\nKupp has not been utilized this year like he had been throughout his time with the LA Rams. An outsider who does not watch Seahawks games each week might even be forgiven for thinking he's not much of an impact player anymore. However, for those who do, know what Kupp brings to the Seahawks. Against the 49ers, the Eastern Washington native reminded everyone he is a veteran with plenty of playoff experience. Kupp led Seattle with 60 yards on five receptions and gave the offense a presense at wide receiver opposite Jaxon Smith-Njigba the team needed.\n\nAs I mentioned in the introduction, the Seahawks are going to be playing in their fourth ever NFC Championship game. The three previous ones have all taken place at Qwest/CenturyLink/Lumen Field, and now a fourth will join the trio. Of course, I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't mention the Seahawks proved to be 3-0 in all of those NFC title games. Whoever emerges from the Rams/Bears game on Sunday will likely be considered a slim underdog at Lumen Field next week, and understandably so.\n\nIt's absurd he has never won this award yet. Think about what John Schneider brought to the Seahawks this year: Sam Darnold, Cooper Kupp, and DeMarcus Lawrence - who forced yet another fumble on Saturday night. Keep in mind Darnold and Kupp were replacements for Geno Smith and DK Metcalf. Not to mention the draft pick they received from Metcalf eventually became Nick Emmanwori, who recovered said fumble from Lawrence. Oh, let's not forget the Seahawks acquired Rashid Shaheed at the deadline. Getting a receiver was no on one's radar, but Schneider identified a way to elevate his team, and Shaheed has rewarded his faith with three return touchdowns in seven games. An absolute game changer. Also, even though they weren't this year, two other trade deadline acquisitions in the form of Leonard Williams and Ernest Jones IV were All-Pro players this year. Lastly, two of his previous first round picks from 2023, Devon Witherspoon and Jaxon Smith-Njigba, both made the Pro Bowl, and JSN was even first team All-Pro. There is simply no one else more deserving of the award, and the blowout win over San Francisco was seeing his mastery all pay off in one game.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Seahawks Wire: Seahawks vs 49ers: Top Seattle takeaways from Divisional Round",

    "description": "The French-born Fery, who is the son of a former tennis player and the president of football club Lorient, stunned an ill Flavio Cobolli on his main draw debut",
    "fullText": "Great Britain’s Arthur Fery claimed the first upset of the Australian Open as the qualifier knocked out 20th seed Flavio Cobolli in the first round.\n\nThe 23-year-old Fery, making his overseas grand slam debut, won 7-6 (1), 6-4, 6-1 to take out the rising star Cobolli, who took a medical timeout and was visited by the doctor as he struggled with a stomach bug.\n\nFery won his first-round match at last year’s Wimbledon, also beating the 20th seed in Australia’s Alexei Popyrin, after receiving a wildcard into the tournament.\n\nThis time, Fery has now scored four victories so far in Melbourne, having come through from the first round of qualifying, and will now take on Argentina’s Tomas Martín Etcheverry in the second round.\n\n“It seems I like drawing 20th seeds at grand slams,” Fery laughed afterwards during his on-court interview. “I felt great. I felt very comfortable on that court. Obviously playing three matches beforehand in quallies really helped.”\n\nRanked 186th in the world, Fery was born in France and his mother, Olivia Fery, was a professional tennis player. His father, Loic Fery, is a businessman and president of French top-flight football club FC Lorient.\n\n“It definitely really helped when I was younger in my development to have two parents who know how pro-sport works and the pressures of it,” said Fery, who is also fluent in French due to his parents.\n\n“Keeping a good balance between trying to develop tennis but also having a life and having an education and keeping your kid balanced when he is young. It’s very important. I'm very lucky for that.”\n\nHe went to school at King College in Wimbledon before enrolling at Stanford University in the United States on a tennis scholarship, a route also taken by the British No 2 Cameron Norrie and No 3 Jacob Fearnley (both Texas Christian University) in recent years.\n\nFery played for three years at Stanford, between 2020 and 2023, while also studying for a degree in science and technology, and became the No 1 ranked singles player in the college system during his second year.\n\n“It was a good experience. It's very different to going pro straightaway,” Fery said. “I think I wasn't quite ready for the pro tour at 18 when I came out of juniors.\n\n“I wasn't ready to travel 35, 40 weeks a year. So college was a great experience. You obviously get a world-class education at Stanford. At the same time you can play loads of matches, develop as a player.\n\n“You are left to your own a little bit more than if you have a travelling coach all the time with you. It's character-building for sure. I was lucky, very lucky, to be around great people and great coaches.\n\n“It's very individual. Some guys are ready to go all guns blazing 35 weeks a year travelling with a coach, or without. That's their identity. They are a tennis player from 18.\n\n“I was still in normal school until 16. I did A-levels, home school at home playing juniors. Tennis wasn't my life at 18. Now I feel like it is. It's my job.”\n\nFery made two appearances in the main draw at Wimbledon, his home tournament, before earning his first win over Popyrin at last year’s Championships. He lost to Luciano Darderi in the second round.\n\nBut Fery also took a step forwards in his career in September when he replaced the British No 1 Jack Draper and the injured Fearnley in Great Britain’s Davis Cup tie against Poland, beating Olaf Pieczkowski 6-4 6-2 in Gdynia.\n\nAlong with his first title on the Challenger circuit, Fery entered the 2026 season with a career-high ranking of 185 in the world - although he is already set to gain more than 50 places after beating Cobolli in the first round of the Australian Open.\n\nThe French-born Fery also said it was “satisfying” to produce a big result at the grand slams away from Wimbledon, where British players can receive wildcards and have the backing of the home crowds.\n\n“Obviously when you see the draw, you play a seed, you know you need your best tennis to get through. Maybe it was a good thing for me as well to know that I had to really play well and bring my best tennis today to have a chance. I thought I did that. I felt really at that level.\n\n“I was already happy to qualify here for my first time in the quallies of a slam on my own. Now coming through quallies and winning a round, I'm proud of it. I was hoping that at some point I was going to be able to play other slams without needing wildcards. So that's a good step forward for my career for sure.”\n\nAfter qualifying for the main draw, Fery’s mum flew out to Australia just in time for his match against Cobolli.\n\n“When I won that last round, she asked me if she could come,” Fery said. “It's obviously it's a long way, but at least I made it worth it. She can see at least two matches - hopefully more.”\n\nArgentina’s Etcheverry, who has a career-high ranking of 27 and beat Andy Murray on his final-ever match at the Australian Open.\n\nEtcheverry battled past Miomir Kecmanovic in five sets and Fery said: “He's been on tour for a while, so I know him. I've seen some matches, but not too much. I guess we'll speak about it with my coach and come with a good game plan.”",

(AP) — Mikael Granlund scored at 4:02 of overtime, and the Anaheim Ducks beat the Los Angeles Kings 2-1 on Saturday night to sweep a two-game weekend set in the Freeway Faceoff rivalry.\n\nRookie Beckett Sennecke created the winning score by swooping in on a backcheck to take the puck away from Los Angeles' Kevin Fiala on a breakaway. Sennecke knocked the puck straight to Granlund, who beat Anton Forsberg for his ninth goal of the season.\n\nMason McTavish scored the first goal and Ville Husso made 17 saves for the Ducks. They have won three straight after a nine-game skid.\n\nAdrian Kempe scored a power-play goal and Forsberg stopped 30 shots in the backup's strong performance for the Kings, who have lost six of seven.\n\nSennecke played a major role for the second straight night when the Southern California clubs completed their back-to-back set by going to overtime for the third time in their four meetings this season. Sennecke had two assists and scored in the shootout as the Ducks rallied from a two-goal deficit for a 3-2 victory over the Kings in downtown Los Angeles on Friday night.\n\nMcTavish ended the Ducks' victory in LA with his fourth shootout goal of the season, and he opened the scoring in the rematch with a wrist shot for his 12th goal early in the first period.\n\nKempe tied it in the second period, scoring his 16th goal on a hard one-timer off a pass from Fiala. Kempe then put a gloved finger to his lips, shushing the sixth consecutive sellout crowd in Anaheim.\n\nLos Angeles had six power plays before the Ducks got their first man-advantage late in the second period, yet Anaheim had a significant edge in shots after carrying play for long stretches at even strength.\n\nAfter a scoreless third, the Kings played into extra time for a league-high 20th time this season.\n\nJeffrey Viel made his debut for the Ducks, who traded a fourth-round pick to Boston on Friday to get the veteran forward who hasn't scored in the NHL since March 18, 2022.

    "fullText": "Chelsea are reportedly interested in signing an Ivory Coast winger who has 3 goals in 9 games for his country so far.\n\nIt’s actually his only 9 games he’s had for Ivory Coast so far, having come up through the youth teams of his national side first.\n\nChelsea are mostly being linked with new centre backs right now for this transfer window, but we are hearing a lot about other positions being targeted in the summer probably, as well as any potential more opportunities arising this window.\n\nJanuary is a long month so they have plenty of time still to get some deals done, but this story is more than likely going to be one for the summer, of they do decide to make an attempt to try and sign him\n\nYan Diomande playing for RB Leipzig. (Photo by Stuart Franklin/Getty Images)\n\nAccording to Sky Germany, Chelsea among top clubs interested in RB Leipzig’s winger Yan Diomande.\n\nThe 19-year-old left winger has only been at Leipzig since the summer but already there are talks of the big clubs coming in for him – Chelsea being one of them.\n\nWe’ll see if anything goes any further on this one, but it’s clear that if this is a transfer that is going to happen then it will be for the summer of 2026 rather than this window now.\n\nObviously we had a game on yesterday with Chelsea beating Brentford 2-0 at Stamford Bridge in their latest Premier League match. It was a needed win, but it might have come at the cost of another injury to a defender, with Liam Rosenior putting the latest out on that after the game yesterday afternoon.\n\nCole Palmer’s poor recent form continued yesterday, but Rosenior has defended his attacking midfielder in the media and denied any suggestion of poor form.",

    "description": "Brabec misses winning by 2 seconds, Ford Raptors get lost, but American Polaris team wins again",
    "fullText": "A series of unfortunate events wound up costing American Honda rider Ricky Brabec the win in the motorcycle class of the 2026 Dakar rally, a race held for the seventh year in Saudi Arabia.\n\nAfter two weeks of racing over countless miles of sand and rocks, Argentine Luciano Benavides, riding a KTM, edged out American Ricky Brabec’s Honda by two seconds, the narrowest margin in the history of the event.\n\nIt was just the final cruel twist of fate Dakar had to deal out.\n\n“I have no idea why we lost, it makes no sense to me,” said two-time winner Brabec at the finish line, after he had congratulated Benavides.\n\nAh, but we have an idea. Several.\n\nFirst was camels. Brabec came upon a herd he estimated at 50-strong way out in a rocky section of that day’s stage. He couldn’t go around them because of the big rocks on either side of the dirt road, he couldn’t go through them because camels are really big, and he couldn’t even honk a horn because race bikes don’t have horns.\n\n“The camels were freakin’ in the road and I couldn’t go around them. I was like, ‘Damn, I don’t know what to do. I’m losing time right here.’ There were probably, like, 50 camels, right? So I’m like, ‘Dude I can’t go around, there’s, like, big black boulder rocks just everywhere,’ and I was like, ‘If I go out and try to risk going around the camels I’m gonna make it (the motorcycle) tip over, maybe smash something, twist an ankle or just something so stupid,’ so I just sat behind ‘em and I tried to get as close as I can and maybe they would shoo and go anywhere in the rocks. But yeah I was kinda bummed about this situation.”\n\nThen, on another day’s stage, Brabec stopped again, this time to help a fallen competitor. Australian KTM rider Daniel Sanders crashed 138 kilometers into the second half of Wednesday's marathon stage from Wadi ad Dawasir to Bisha, breaking his collarbone and sternum, according to abc.au.\n\n“I came over the dune and Tosh (Spanish Honda rider Tosha Schareina) came over the dune, and he (Sanders) was just kind of under his bike, stuck,” Brabec said. “So me and Tosh stopped. Tosh stopped at the top of the dune to make sure no one was coming to jump and land on him. Then I was down in the dune helping Daniel.”\n\nHe got that sorted out but, in the process, lost the lead. Sanders, being a tough Australian, got back on his bike… and finished the stage.\n\nNor did Brabec. He regained the lead in the following days and, until, just two kliks from the finish line, when he was in the lead by over three minutes and had only to cruise his Monster Energy Honda to the inflatable Red Bull arch and take his third Dakar win, something happened.\n\n“I navigated well all day,” Brabec said. “One route note, right here, two kilometers from the finish, I don’t know. I took the wrong left. The route book showed one left, so I took the left. It put me in a bad situation, and here we are.”\n\nOn the four-wheeled side of Dakar, meanwhile, it was a Dacia that won. Dacias are one of the cheapest cars you can buy in Europe, and the one you give a big sigh over when they assign it to you at the car rental counter at Charles de Gaulle. The somewhat diminutive Dacia Sandrider prototype looked like a little bug, but won it all over the mighty 2026 Ford Raptor T1 Ultimate Dakar Rally car and the equally mighty (and last year’s winner) Toyota Hilux.\n\nIt helped that it was driven by Qatari driver Nasser Al Attiyah, who had already won Dakar five times, this year making six.\n\nFord showed up at Dakar with four factory entries, while an additional four privateers also drove Raptors. It was the first year Ford came as an official factory team.\n\nThe trucks, too, had been upgraded.\n\n“The Ford Raptor T1+ itself represents the most complete expression yet of what we’ve learned through years of desert racing,” Ford said before the race. “It is lighter, more aerodynamically efficient, delivers dramatically improved visibility and control, and incorporates meaningful gains in suspension performance, cockpit access, and overall durability.”\n\nIn the early stages, Ford was doing well, swapping wins with Toyota’s Hilux trucks. But both Ford and Toyota didn’t show enough wins to last at the top of the leaderboard, and all the time Al Attiyah was moving up. While he won Stage 2, by his Stage 6 win, he seemed in strong contention to win it all. And despite Ford winning five stages and the prologue, navigation errors by Ford drivers, and smoother running by Al Attiyah throughout, meant the Qatari driver was the winner.\n\nIn SxS competition, as in Baja, it was American Brock Heger in the Loeb Fraymedia Motorsport Polaris RZR Factory Racing entry that claimed his second Dakar win in the class, after doing the same dominating dance in SCORE desert racing in Baja.\n\nIn the Stock class it was Defender Rally in its debut year, as drivers Rokas Baciuška and Oriol Vidal win in the Defender Dakar D7X‑R. Teammates Sara Price and Sean Berriman finished in second place, while ‘Mr Dakar’ Stéphane Peterhansel and co‑driver Mika Metge finished in fourth position in the Dakar Rally Stock class rankings.\n\n“Dakar Rally was just incredible,” said Price. “We had a goal at the final stage to get to the finish line as a team together. So to see the whole Defender team sitting there at the finish line and all their excitement and emotions, it just shows what this is all about and what it means. To get this team to the finish line in P1 and P2 is just, wow, incredible.”\n\nAs was the whole two-week adventure. If you can’t get enough of this off-road stuff, the SCORE King Shocks San Felipe 250 starts March 25-29 in Baja. But that’s an entirely different kind of racing.",

    "description": "Get out of the way or you’re going to get run over by the Seahawks!",
    "fullText": "That was supremely satisfying. Mike Macdonald loves his rallying cries, whether it’s “12 as one”, “Chasing Edges,” or “E.A.T.”. I’ve got another one for the Seattle Seahawks after that 41-6 dismantling of the San Francisco 49ers in the Division Round – Professional Destruction.\n\nThose two words embody Macdonald’s vision for the team and perfectly encapsulate the way Seattle has been playing for the last two months. ‘The Dark Side” defense has been utterly suffocating opposing offenses while the running game has been on a roll. For weeks I’ve been trying to find different ways to describe the dominance the Seahawks have been showcasing, particularly on the defensive side. The way Ken Walker is running behind this nasty offensive line, the offense also fully deserves the Professional Destruction moniker.\n\nKen Walker III is really damn good…historically good for the Seahawks playoffs actually.\n\n@Seahawks RB Kenneth Walker III tied the postseason franchise record with three rushing touchdowns. #GoHawks\n\n— Seahawks PR (@seahawksPR) January 18, 2026\n\nThe offensive line was giving him good creases and Walker was hitting the hole with burst. He also had some fantastic cutbacks and broke tackles on the way. Maybe the most emblematic run of how the Seahawks are playing right now was the one in the fourth quarter where he ran into a crowd and got pushed about five yards farther when the rest of the team got in on the action. The Seahawks are physically imposing their will on the opponents. I would take his stat line of 19 carries for 116 yards and 3 TDs any day.\n\nErnest Jones IV is really damn good. He singlehandedly caused two turnovers today, stripping the ball from Jake Tonges on Seattle’s second defensive drive and picked off Brock Purdy later in the game. He’s a tackling machine and is the leader in the middle of the defense getting everyone lined up. Picking up Jones in a trade last season is one of the best trades John Schneider has made as GM of the Seahawks.\n\nRashid Shaheed is really damn good. Speaking of great trades by John Schneider, the Shaheed trade is the gift that keeps on giving. His opening kickoff return for a TD was literally the game-winner, and was his third return TD since joining the Seahawks at the trade deadline. Shaheed also had a huge run on an end-around and drew a pass interference penalty. With Tory Horton’s injury, adding Shaheed has been a massive key to the Seahawks success this season.\n\nDeMarcus Lawrence is really damn good. He got to Brock Purdy on his first throw of the game, nearly forcing a fumble. Later, he blew up a fourth down play. Even later, he strip-sacked Purdy and the ball was recovered by Nick Emmanwori. Tank came to the Seahawks because he thought they had a chance to win the Super Bowl. He’s doing his best to make that a reality.\n\nPlayoff Cooper Kupp is awesome. His stat line of 5 catches for 60 yards might not be the most impressive, but all of them seemed to come at crucial times. Kupp was the reliable safety blanket that everyone hoped he would be after signing with his hometown team.\n\nThe tight ends didn’t have any catches today, but they all blocked their asses off. AJ Barner and Eric Saubert were both throwing key blocks on the outside runs that Walker was so effective with against the 49ers. That kind of selfless play is why those guys are beloved.\n\nIt was good to see Charles Cross and Coby Bryant back out there. Bryant finished the game, unlike Cross, but hopefully it was just precautionary with Charles. Zach Charbonnet was injured as well, but the initial prognosis was somewhat hopeful. He’s a huge part of the third down packages and a touchdown machine, so having him miss time would hurt the offense.\n\nThe offensive line blocked really well again today as evidenced by the 175 yards rushing, the fourth week in a row that Seattle ran for 150+ yards. At this point, I don’t think it’s a fluke. No better time for the run game to come alive than at the most important time of the season!\n\nSeattle will host the NFC Championship game for the first time in over a decade and got damn does it feel good! Whether it’s the third matchup with the Los Angeles Rams or a showdown with the No. 2 seed Chicago Bears, it’s sure to be a wild atmosphere. Until then, enjoy this one folks. This is a special, special team!",

    "slug": "what-were-books-like-in-ancient-greece-and-rome",
    "title": "What were books like in ancient Greece and Rome?",
    "description": "Ancient bookstore were surprisingly modern.",
    "fullText": "This article originally appeared in The Conversation.\n\nIf you were to visit a bookshop in the ancient world, what would it be like?\n\nYou don’t just have to imagine it. The ancient Roman writer Aulus Gellius, who lived in the 2nd century CE, gives us a number of descriptions of his adventures at bookstores. In one passage, he describes an encounter at one in Rome, which he was visiting with a poet friend:\n\nI chanced to be sitting in a bookshop in the Sigillaria with the poet Julius Paulus […] There was on sale there the Annals of Quintus Fabius Pictor in a copy of good and undoubted age, which the dealer maintained was without errors.\n\nGellius then tells us that, while they are sitting there, another customer enters the shop. The new customer has a disagreement with the dealer. He complains that he “found in the book one error”. The dealer says that’s impossible. Then the customer brings out evidence to prove the dealer wrong.\n\nIn different passage, Aulus tells us about some bookstalls he came across when he arrived by ship at the port of Brundisium on the Adriatic coast. The books, he records, were “in Greek, filled with marvellous tales, things unheard of, incredible […] The writers were ancient and of no mean authority”.\n\nThe volumes themselves, however, were filthy from neglect, in bad condition and unsightly. Nevertheless, I drew near and asked their price; then, attracted by their extraordinary and unexpected cheapness, I bought a large number of them for a small sum.\n\nAulus goes on to describe in excited language all the weird facts he derived from these books – like how people in Africa can “work spells by voice and tongue” and through this witchcraft cause people, animals, trees and crops to die.\n\nThese sorts of stories bring us close to how ordinary people in ancient Greek and Roman times obtained books and engaged with books. But if we read stories like this it might lead us to want to know more. How did books and writing come into existence? And how were books written and produced?\n\nMany people in the ancient world thought that writing had been invented by gods or heroes. For example, the ancient Egyptians believed the god Thoth was the first to create signs to represent spoken sounds.\n\nThe origins of writing are certainly mysterious. It’s unclear when writing began and who invented it.\n\nThe earliest written text is a wooden tablet radiocarbon dated to before 5000 BCE. This is known as the Dispilio tablet, because it was discovered at a neolithic lakeside settlement at Dispilio in Greece. It is carved with strange linear markings. These have not been deciphered, but most scholars think they are a form of writing.\n\nEvidence for writing appears early in different parts of the world. In Mesopotamia and Egypt, the oldest texts, such as the Kish limestone tablet at Uruk or the Narmer Palette at Hierakonpolis, date to before 3000 BCE. In the Indus Valley, the Harappan script, which remains undeciphered, appeared around the same time. In China, the earliest characters, the Dawenkou graphs, also date to around 3000 BCE.\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of early writing is that there is such a variety of different scripts. For example, the earliest known texts in the Greek language are written in the Linear B script, which was used from around 1500-1200 BCE, and wasn’t deciphered until 1952. Linear B is not an alphabet, but a syllabary of more than 80 different signs. A syllabary is a kind of writing system where each sign represents a syllable.\n\nOur English alphabet comes from the Romans, who in the 8th and 7th century BCE also got their alphabet from the Phoenicians, via the Greeks.\n\nPeople in ancient times used many different things as writing materials.\n\nThe Roman writer Pliny the Elder (23-79 CE) tells us that the earliest people in the world\n\nused to write on palm-leaves and then on the bark of certain trees, and afterwards folding sheets of lead began to be employed for official muniments, and then also sheets of linen or tablets of wax for private documents.\n\nHowever, the most popular writing material in the ancient Mediterranean was papyrus, from which we get our word “paper”.\n\nTo make papyrus, you get the pith of the papyrus plant (Cyperus papyrus), cut it into slender strips, then press it together. Once dried, it forms a thin sheet that you can write on.\n\nPapyrus sheets were usually glued together into rolls. These rolls could be very long. Some of the most lavish Egyptian papyrus rolls were more than 10 metres long, such as the recently discovered Waziri Papyrus containing parts of the Book of the Dead.\n\nWhen papyri were rolled up they were stored in shelves or boxes. Labels were attached to the handles of the papyri so you could identify their contents. In his play Linus, Greek playwright Alexis (c. 375-275 BC) has one character tell another how to look through a bunch of rolls to find what he wants:\n\ngo over and pick any papyrus roll you like out of there and then read it… examining them quietly, and at your leisure, on the basis of the labels. Orpheus is in there, Hesiod, tragedies, Choerilus, Homer, Epicharmus, prose treatises of every type…\n\nPapyrus seems flimsy to the eye, but it is a durable writing material, stronger than modern paper. Many papyri have survived for thousands of years stored in jars or sarcophagi or buried under the sand.\n\nThe oldest surviving papyrus text is the so-called Diary of Merer (which you can listen to here), the logbook of a man named Merer, who was an inspector during the construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza under Pharaoh Khufu. This papyrus, which dates to around 2600 BCE, gives a day-by-day account of how Merer and his team of about 200 men spent time hauling and transporting stone and doing other work.\n\nPapyrus was susceptible to being eaten by insects or mice. But there were ways to prevent this. Pliny the Elder, for example, advises that sheets of papyrus soaked in citrus-oil won’t be eaten by moths.\n\nIf you were living in ancient Greece or Rome and wanted to write a book, how would you do it?\n\nFirst, you would buy sheets or rolls of papyrus to write on. If you couldn’t afford it, you’d have to write on the back or in the margins of papyri you already owned.\n\nIf you didn’t own any papyri already, then you would have to write on other materials. According to the Greek historian Diogenes Laertius (3rd century CE), the philosopher Cleanthes (c. 331-231 BCE) “wrote down lectures on oyster-shells and the blade-bones of oxen through lack of money to buy papyrus”.\n\nSecond, you would get your ink. In the ancient world, there were many varieties of ink. Normal black ink was made from the soot of burnt resin or pitch mixed with vegetable gum. When buying ink, it would come in powder form, and you would need to mix it with water before using it.\n\nThird, you would get your pen. It would be made from reed, hence it was called the “calamus” by Greeks and Romans (“calamus” is the Greek word for reed). To sharpen your pen you would need a knife. If you made a mistake, you would erase it with a wet sponge.\n\nNow you have all the materials you need. However, you don’t need to use the pen and papyrus yourself. If you want, you can get a scribe to write down your words for you.\n\nThe Greek orator Dio Chrysostom (c.40-110 CE) even advised writers not to use the pen themselves:\n\nWriting I do not advise you to engage in with your own hand, or only very rarely, but rather to dictate to a secretary.\n\nIf you needed to consult other books while writing, you could get friends to send them to you or ask book dealers to make you a copy. In a papyrus from the 2nd century CE found at Oxyrhynchus, Egypt, and written in Greek, the writer asks his friend to find the books that he needs and make copies of them. Otherwise, you would go to a library, though the best libraries at Alexandria, Rome and Athens might be far away.\n\nWhen you finished drafting your book you would need to revise and correct it. You could then publish it by having many copies made by scribes and delivering these copies to friends and booksellers.\n\nWhen all this was done, your book would be out in public. Perhaps someone like Aulus Gellius would stumble across it in a busy Roman bookshop. Maybe he’d even buy it.",

    "fullText": "Call me old-fashioned, but hardly a day goes by where I'm not thinking about the ARPANET.\n\nI mean, c'mon, it's the dang ARPANET - the precursor to today's Internet, basically marking the beginnings of disparate computer systems talking to each other, of people talking to each other through computers, concocted way back in 1969. If you look at what people were doing on the ARPANET almost immediately (and even earlier on similar systems like University of Illinois's PLATO), you'll see that the ARPANET was a harbinger for all the games and e-commerce and apps and whatnot that we rely on every single second of every single day. How can you not be thinking about this stuff all the time?\n\nSince I've already written somewhat of a love-letter to the World Wide Web in our post explaining how Folio connects with suppliers, I'd like to now continue this theme of computer history affection with a dive into one of the earlier protocols from the ARPANET era. It's a protocol that still powers many procurement workflows like order processing, catalog sharing, invoicing, and more.\n\nThat's right, it's the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) - invented in 1971 - along with its more secure, late '90s sibling: SFTP.\n\nAnd, rest assured, we're not just spelunking into these Internet protocols for the sake of it (though there's nothing wrong with that), we're going to be actively giving context for some of the advantages of leveraging Folio's API + web-based lightning integrations for procure-to-pay workflows, while still paying respect to traditional SFTP file drops. Along the way, we're going to code up a few toy examples to understand why SFTP is more secure than FTP, as well as what the heck people mean when they talk about those daily or weekly SFTP \"sweeps\" (and, crucially, why it's hard to figure out if they worked or not!).\n\nIf you're a fellow ARPANET history buff, you're already familiar with RFCs (Request for Comments). For the uninitiated, RFCs are basically the history of the Internet, one technical design doc at a time (see, they're not just for FAANG promo packets). And, guess what, they're all online for anyone to read! I'll prove it - here's the first RFC on FTP - RFC 114.\n\nRFC 114, published in 1971 — eighteen years before the World Wide Web — established FTP as a protocol for transferring files between computers over a network. Many more RFCs were published over time on FTP, honing its implementation as the ARPANET and eventually the Internet evolved into what we know (and sorta love) today.\n\nFTP, as defined in its RFCs, uses a client-server architecture with two separate connections:\n\nControl connection (port 21): Where you send commands like \"list directory\" or \"upload this file\"\n\nData connection (port 20): Where the actual file content flows\n\nFrom these early specifications to the present day with SFTP, the basic file transfer UX of this protocol remains largely the same: a user connects to an server, authenticates with credentials, navigates through directories, and transfers files.\n\nIndeed, so much so that I was using FTP back in the mid '90s without even realizing it.\n\nImagine this scene: you've just hit *save* on the last edit to your personal homepage in Notepad or BBEdit (or let's be honest, Dreamweaver). Your site's got some <marquee> and <blink> tags, a page views hit counter, and definitely an \"Under Construction\" GIF. Probably also this classic:\n\nSo now what? Is your cool website \"on-line\" yet? Nope! Apparently, you need to get this HTML file thing from your family's Gateway 2000 computer onto, quote, your \"web host's server\" (whatever that means…) so your friends can check out your site.\n\nAfter talking to your web hosting provider's support hotline, they send you an email with your FTP credentials:\n\nYou dutifully follow along with the provided instructions, firing up a dedicated FTP client app, plugging in these credentials, and connecting to their server. The FTP client interface shows two panes side by side—your local home computer on the left, and the remote web server on the right.\n\nYou can see folders and files on some server probably thousands of miles away, and you can drag and drop files between your computer and that remote machine.\n\nYou drag index.html from left to right, watch a progress bar fill up, and boom—your website is live. Navigate to http://www.geocities.com/your_username and there's your homepage! You hit refresh a couple dozen times to get that counter up (at least that's what I always did).\n\nBut easy wasn't the problem with FTP. It's that everything in FTP is transmitted in plaintext (aka human-readable, unencrypted text).\n\nEvery time Dreamweaver connected to your GeoCities web server via FTP:\n\nYour welcome123 password flew across the Internet unencrypted\n\nThe contents of the website site (e.g. index.html) transferred unencrypted\n\nSomeone at your ISP, your hosting provider, or anywhere in between could theoretically read everything\n\nFor personal hobby sites, most folks didn't care (or were largely unaware of any issue). But you can imagine how this would be a problem for anything commerce-related (for example, imagine if the file contents were actually meant to be something private, rather than an HTML file for public consumption).\n\nSince we're big fans of procurement at Folio, let's put this issue into procure-to-pay terms.\n\nImagine you're a food supplier for hotels and restaurants. You'd like to share your *EDI 832 Price/Sales Catalog* file with a procurement platform so that your customers can view your products and place purchase orders with you.\n\nEDI (Electronic Data Interchange) is the idea of businesses exchanging structured electronic documents to facilitate workflows that were previously done via paper. Think purchase orders, invoices, catalogs, etc. EDI files are very commonly exchanged via SFTP.\n\nEvery week, you connect to the procurement platform's FTP server to transfer your latest EDI X12 832 catalog file, which contains your customer specific catalog, including special negotiated pricing for each of your items with each of your hotel customers.\n\nIf you were to transmit this file via FTP, then all of your catalog information flows across the Internet in plaintext (aka plain, readable, unencrypted text that anyone could understand). That means that anyone with network access along the path of your transmission could:\n\nCapture your login credentials and access this FTP server\n\nIntercept sensitive business information, including your negotiated pricing and item availability\n\nIt's easy to see how this lack of encryption would be problematic. As commerce and other sensitive workflows like finance gained in popularity on the ARPANET and Internet, it became increasingly obviously that transmitting credentials and business data in plaintext was going to be unacceptable.\n\nLet's try this out ourselves in an educational toy demo to see this security issue with FTP directly.\n\nFor the technically-inclined, I'll assume you're following along on a modern Mac with uv installed (it's a modern Python package / project manager that simplifies a lot of the traditional Python headaches) as well as Homebrew.\n\nIn three separate terminal windows, we're going to:\n\nRun an FTP server locally on our computer\n\nListen to local \"internet\" traffic on our computer using tcpdump\n\nConnect to the local FTP server, as if were planning to transfer a file!\n\nIf all goes well with our demo, we should be able to see the plaintext credentials being sent to the FTP server in terminal #2, demonstrating the plaintext vulnerability with FTP.\n\nIn terminal #1, let's run the pyftpdlib package (a Python FTP server) to start a local FTP server:\n\nIn terminal #2, we can start listening to internet traffic with tcpdump and we'll even filter it down just to look for the FTP credentials.\n\nIn terminal #3, we can now connect to our local FTP server (still running in Terminal #1) with the lftp app (which you'll likely have to first install with Homebrew):\n\nFinally, back in terminal #2, which is still sitting there, listening to internet traffic and searching for the phrase USER or PASS, you should now see the unencrypted username testuser and the unencrypted password testpass123 printed out directly.\n\nUh-oh! It's easy to imagine a real world scenario here — you can see how transmitting these credentials in plaintext makes it easier for someone to gain access to your company's purchase order system. This issue with FTP is clearly not a good situation for serious business applications, like procurement or invoicing workflows.\n\nWhich now brings us to the 1990s, when a new idea emerged for remote computing and file transfers onto the Internet RFC scene: SSH and SFTP.\n\nSFTP stands for SSH File Transfer Protocol (thought it's sometimes incorrectly referred to as Secure File Transfer Protocol). Despite the similarity in names, SFTP is not FTP with encryption attached. Instead, it's an entirely separate protocol designed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as an extension of the SSH (Secure Shell) protocol (first specified in RFC 4250 back in 1995).\n\nSFTP uses a single encrypted connection over port 22 (the same port that SSH uses) to handle both commands and data transfer.\n\nSSH handshake: The client initiates a connection to the server on port 22\n\nAuthentication: The server verifies the client's identity using either username/password, SSH keys, or both\n\nEncrypted tunnel: SSH establishes an encrypted tunnel where all subsequent data flows\n\nSFTP subsystem: Within this secure tunnel, the SFTP protocol handles file operations\n\nPerhaps one of the greatest benefits of this approach is that everything - authentication credentials, file contents, and even directory listings - is encrypted end-to-end. A listener on the network would see nothing but encrypted gibberish. This is why many workflows (in procurement and beyond) use SFTP for transferring files to this day.\n\nImportantly, SFTP isn't just about moving files from one computer to another. You can do quite a bit:\n\nget / put: Download and upload files\n\nls / mkdir: List directories and create folders\n\nrename / rm: Rename and delete files\n\nresume: Resume interrupted transfers (a lifesaver on unreliable connections)\n\nWith these building-blocks, developers have built some really nice UIs for SFTP that feel exactly like using your local computer's file system (I'm thinking of Panic's Transmit app, for one). But you can also stick to the command line if that's your thing!\n\nFor example, in procurement workflows, a typical SFTP interaction might look like this.\n\nWe're first grabbing the latest catalog file with that get command, and then we're dropping in a purchase order for the supplier with the put command. The specific format of these files really depends on what the supplier expects or requires. As mentioned earlier, many procure-to-pay workflows leverage some form of an EDI specification — but these vary quite widely in practice (EDI merits a whole other blog post, to be fair - I'll pencil this in now for the future).\n\nAnyway, in practice (hopefully), no one is really typing in these SFTP commands at 2 AM. That's what computers are for, silly! Here's where automation comes in.\n\nIn procurement SFTP integrations, \"sweeps\" or \"polling\" refers to the automated process of periodically checking a folder for new files. It's the mechanism that keeps EDI and other SFTP procurement workflows humming along without human intervention.\n\nHere's how a typical catalog sweep works:\n\nSupplier maintains an SFTP server with designated folders\n\nHotel's procurement system has credentials to access specific folders on the supplier's SFTP server\n\nA background job is configured by the hotel's procurement system to \"sweep\" the catalog folder every week (or on whichever cadence the supplier updates their catalog).\n\nAt scheduled time (say, 2:00 AM), the procurement system connects via SFTP\n\nIt lists all files in the /outgoing/catalog folder\n\nFor each file, it checks: \"Have I seen this file before?\" likely using some pattern in the filename\n\nNew files are downloaded and processed\n\nOptionally, processed files are moved to an /archive folder or deleted\n\nSystem waits until next scheduled sweep next week\n\nHopefully it's obvious that there's no real-time notification. The supplier's server doesn't \"push\" files to the hotel. The procurement system has to periodically \"ask\" if anything new has arrived. It's like checking your mailbox instead of waiting for a doorbell.\n\nYou'll also see sweeps in the other direction, where a procurement platform drops new purchase orders into a folder on a supplier's SFTP server, and the supplier \"sweeps\" them out every minute or so for order processing. And, hopefully, at that point, it all works, that all the products are available and nothing's out of stock, and the purchase order goes through without a hitch, but we'll get into each of these potential issues in a bit.\n\nFor now, let's try out sweeping ourselves.\n\nLet's set up a local SFTP server using Docker. We'll be able to see exactly how files appear and disappear during sweep operations.\n\nFirst, create a simple configuration file called sftp.json. We'll feed this config into our SFTP server (it sets up our simple username and password, for example).\n\nBecause I'm really nice, here's a one-liner to create that file:\n\nNow we can spin up an SFTP server using the open-source emberstack/sftp Docker image:\n\nGreat, now we should have an SFTP server running on localhost:2222.\n\nLet's connect to our local server:\n\nTry creating a file locally and watching it appear in the SFTP server (this happens via the config setup with Docker).\n\nBack in our SFTP session, let's grab this file.\n\nPretty basic stuff, I suppose. But still cool. We navigated to a directory in an SFTP server and transmitted a file from the SFTP server to our local computer, just like you would in a procurement catalog sweep.\n\nNow let's write some automation!\n\nWe are going to make our own SFTP sweep script.\n\nFirst, let's set up SSH key authentication for our script (which is more secure and automation-friendly than passwords).\n\nWhy SSH keys? SSH key authentication is strongly preferred over passwords for automated systems. Keys can't be accidentally typed incorrectly, they can be rotated without updating credentials in multiple places, and they provide non-repudiation (you know exactly which system made each connection).\n\nThis creates two files: supplier_key (private key) and supplier_key.pub (public key).\n\nWe're using Ed25519 here because it is a modern, elliptic curve-based algorithm that's more secure than traditional RSA keys while using much shorter key lengths (256 bits vs 2048+ bits for RSA).\n\nNow we need to configure our SFTP server to accept this key. To do this, we can update our sftp.json file with this command:\n\nNow we need to copy our public key into the server's authorized keys. First, stop your existing container:\n\nIf you've connected to localhost:2222 before (perhaps from earlier in this tutorial), you'll want to clean up the old host key to avoid SSH warnings:\n\nCreate the SSH directory structure and copy your public key:\n\nRestart the SFTP server with the updated configuration:\n\nNow create a file called sweep.sh with these contents:\n\nThe -i ./supplier_key flag tells SFTP to use our private key for authentication instead of prompting for a password. This is exactly how automated procurement systems authenticate—no human interaction required!\n\nRun this script and watch as it periodically checks for new CSV files. Drop some CSV files into sftp-data/outgoing/ and watch them get picked up on the next sweep and downloaded into your downloads folder.\n\nAre you now a procurement platform? Are you now a supplier platform? Probably not, but this is still pretty cool.\n\nAs we've just seen, SFTP sweeps work reliably for what they're designed to do: batch file transfers on a schedule. But they introduce fundamental limitations that can impact modern, real-time procure-to-pay workflows.\n\nWhen you submit a purchase order via SFTP, here's what typically happens:\n\nYour procurement system uploads PO-12345.xml to the supplier's /incoming/orders folder\n\nEventually (1 minute? 30 minutes? 2 hours? Next business day?) the supplier platform sweeps the SFTP folder and processes the batch\n\nThey drop PO-12345-confirmation.xml in their /outgoing/orders folder\n\nYou finally learn if the order was accepted or if there were errors from out of stock items, etc.\n\nCompare this to a modern API where you'd get an immediate response:\n\nLet's say you submit an order with an invalid product SKU. With SFTP:\n\nOrder uploads successfully (file transfer succeeded)\n\nSome time later, you get an error file back\n\nNow you need to correlate that error with the original order\n\nRe-submit a corrected order with that item removed or error resolved\n\nWith synchronous APIs, you'd know immediately that SKU \"12345A\" should be \"12345-A\" and could fix it on the spot.\n\nYour system likely needs to track: \"Which files have I already processed?\" This leads to complex state management:\n\nMaintain a database of processed filenames\n\nHandle edge cases (what if a file is re-uploaded with the same name?)\n\nDeal with archive folder management\n\nDebug when files mysteriously reprocess\n\nWhen something goes wrong, debugging is harder:\n\n\"Did the file get uploaded?\" (Check your local logs)\n\n\"Did they receive it?\" (Ask the supplier to check their folder)\n\n\"Did they process it?\" (Wait for their response file... eventually)\n\n\"What went wrong?\" (Parse cryptic error codes from a text file)\n\nCompare this to modern API-based systems, which includes Folio's lightning automations, where you typically get:\n\nImmediate success/failure responses\n\nStatus endpoints to check processing state\n\nReal-time web-hooks for completion notifications\n\nGiven these limitations, why does SFTP persist in procurement? A few reasons:\n\nIt's battle-tested: SFTP has been around since the late 1990s and works reliably for what it's good at\n\nIt's firewall-friendly: One port (22) is easier for IT to approve than multiple ports\n\nIt's universally supported: Every major platform has SFTP clients and servers\n\nIt's good enough: For many batch-oriented workflows, hourly or weekly sweeps are sufficient\n\nIt's file-based: Files are easy to archive, audit, and replay if something goes wrong\n\nLow barrier to entry: Setting up SFTP is often simpler and cheaper for IT teams to enable than building APIs\n\nSFTP indeed provides a lowest-common-denominator solution that scales for many procurement workflows.\n\nSFTP isn't going away anytime soon, and that's good! It serves an important role in commerce integrations where batch processing makes sense.\n\nAt Folio, we're flexible — we use SFTP integrations all the time for compatibility with supplier and ERP systems, while also increasingly building real-time API integrations and Folio Lightning Automations to augment some of the concerns with file-based catalogs and purchase orders transferred with SFTP.\n\nFor example, with Folio Lightning Automations, a supplier EDI catalog feed provided via SFTP can be augmented with a Folio Lightning Automation to add real-time stock availability and other enhancements, like product images, that aren't typically included in EDI standards but may be available on a supplier's website. This hybrid approach creates a better user experience for our mutual customers and can drive more sales towards those suppliers, and requires no additional work from suppliers.\n\nWe're excited at Folio to continue collaborating with suppliers to bridge the gap between file-based standards and web-based APIs for more responsive, real-time procurement workflows that serve our hospitality customers.\n\nHopefully, at this point, the next time you're in a meeting and someone mentions \"the weekly catalog sweep\" or \"EDI invoices,\" you'll know exactly what's happening at 2 AM: a reliable, secure, wonderfully-vintage file transfer that keeps procurement moving forward, one batch at a time.\n\nAnd, if you do find yourself working with SFTP regularly, these tools can make your life easier:\n\nTransmit by Panic (macOS): Hands down the most elegant SFTP client I've used. The dual-pane interface makes it feel like working in Finder, and the sync features are incredibly powerful. Perfect for one-off file management.\n\nCyberduck (macOS/Windows): Free, open-source, and supports SFTP plus a dozen other protocols (S3, Azure, etc.). Great for quick connections and bookmarking frequent servers.\n\nFileZilla (Cross-platform): The old reliable. Not the prettiest UI, but it works everywhere and handles the basics well.\n\nemberstack/sftp Docker image: Modern, well-maintained, JSON-based configuration. Great for integration testing in CI/CD pipelines.\n\natmoz/sftp Docker image: Lightweight alternative, command-line based configuration. Perfect for quick local testing.\n\nHave questions about SFTP, EDI, or Lightning Integrations? Or just want to learn more about how Folio connects with suppliers? Drop us a line—we'd love to chat.

    "description": "Heads of state across Europe respond in solidarity with Denmark and Greenland, and boycott of World Cup suggested",
    "fullText": "Heads of state across Europe respond in solidarity with Denmark and Greenland, and boycott of World Cup suggested\n\nDonald Trump threatened a 25% tariff on a slew of European countries including Denmark, Germany, France and the UK – until the US is allowed to purchase Greenland, in an extraordinary escalation of the president’s bid to claim the autonomous Danish territory.\n\nIn a lengthy post on Saturday on Truth Social, Trump said he would impose a 10% tariff on Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland beginning 1 February, “on any and all goods sent to the United States of America”.\n\nHe said the tariff will increase to 25% on 1 June.\n\n“This Tariff will be due and payable until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,” Trump said.\n\nThe president’s longstanding interest in acquiring Greenland “one way or the other” has become a fixation since the US raid that captured Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro earlier in January. While he has claimed the Arctic territory’s current status poses a national security threat to the US, this has been disputed by US allies, including Denmark.\n\nIn the Saturday morning post, Trump said forces from the eight European nations “have journeyed to Greenland, for purposes unknown”. It was an apparent reference to Nato allies deploying troops in Greenland on Thursday in response to Trump’s threats to forcefully take the Arctic island, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark.\n\n“The President’s statement comes as a surprise,” Lars Løkke Rasmussen, Denmark’s foreign minister, responded on social media. “Earlier this week, we had a constructive meeting with Vice President Vance and Secretary Rubio. The purpose of the increased military presence in Greenland, to which the President refers, is to enhance security in the Arctic.”\n\n“Every insult, threat, tariff and lie that we receive strengthens our resolve,” Rasmus Jarlov, the conservative chair of Denmark’s defence committee, wrote in more direct language. “The answer from Denmark and Greenland is final: We will never hand over Greenland. We pray that our true allies will stand with us because we are going to need it.”\n\nThe tariff threat against Nato allies united the leaders of those nations in unusually blunt language, after months of treading carefully for fear of triggering the volatile US president’s rage.\n\nIn response to Trump’s comments on Saturday, the EU commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said in a statement that the Europeans “have consistently underlined our shared transatlantic interest in peace and security in the Arctic, including through NATO. The pre-coordinated Danish exercise, conducted with allies, responds to the need to strengthen Arctic security and poses no threat to anyone.”\n\n“The EU stands in full solidarity with Denmark and the people of Greenland,” she added. “Tariffs would undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.”\n\n“Our position on Greenland is very clear – it is part of the Kingdom of Denmark and its future is a matter for the Greenlanders and the Danes,” the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, said. “Applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of Nato allies is completely wrong. We will of course be pursuing this directly with the US administration.”\n\nEmmanuel Macron, the French president, drew an implicit comparison between Trump’s threats to seize Greenland and Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. “No intimidation or threat will influence us – neither in Ukraine, nor in Greenland, nor anywhere else in the world when we are confronted with such situations,” Macron wrote in a social media riposte to Trump.\n\nFinland’s president, Alexander Stubb, whose excellence at golf previously made him something of a Trump whisperer, echoed the warning about a potential “downward spiral”.\n\n“We will not let ourselves be blackmailed,” the Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, added. That sentiment was echoed by Norway’s prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, who wrote: “Threats have no place among allies.”\n\nGermany’s leadership was more reserved, with the German chancellor Friedrich Merz leaving it to his spokesperson, Stefan Kornelius, to say only that the government “has taken note of” Trump’s statements and plans to coordinate with allies to “decide on appropriate responses at the appropriate time”.\n\nOn Friday, however, a spokesperson on foreign policy for the chancellor’s Christian Democrat party, Jürgen Hardt, suggested that Germany could threaten to boycott the World Cup Trump is hosting this summer “as a last resort in order to get Trump to see sense on the Greenland issue”. Polling done before Trump’s latest threat for the popular German tabloid Bild revealed broad support for a World Cup boycott, with 47% of Germans in favor and just 35% against, should the US annex Greenland.\n\nEven before the new tariff threat, there were mass protests in Greenland and Denmark on Saturday against Trump’s efforts to “acquire” the island.\n\nHis latest tariff threat comes just eight months after Trump announced that he had struck a trade pact with the UK – and six months after he announced a pact with the European Union.\n\nThe UK would have protection against future US tariffs “because I like them”, Trump declared in the summer. He described the pact with the EU as a “powerful deal” and an “important” partnership.\n\nTrump’s sudden reversal on Saturday even managed to alienate one of his biggest fans, Nigel Farage, the leader of the rightwing, anti-immigrant party Reform UK. “We don’t always agree with the US government and in this case we certainly don’t. These tariffs will hurt us,” Farage wrote.\n\nThere was also criticism from Trump’s own Republican party. Thom Tillis, a US senator from North Carolina, called the president’s threat “bad for America” but “great for Putin, Xi and other adversaries who want to see Nato divided”.\n\n“The fact that a small handful of ‘advisers’ are actively pushing for coercive action to seize territory of an ally is beyond stupid,” Tillis added.\n\nThe president has repeatedly turned to tariffs in a bid to force countries to bend to his will – with some success. Days after returning to office for his second term in early 2025, Colombia agreed to accept military aircraft carrying deported migrants after Trump threatened steep duties on the country’s exports to the US.\n\nTrump, who has previously extolled the benefits of tariffs as a negotiating tool, stressed on Saturday that the US was “immediately open to negotiation” with Denmark and any of the countries it was threatening to hit with these new tariffs.\n\nHis aggressive global trade strategy has raised fears for the US economy, which analysts and policymakers have warned could face significant damage from sweeping tariffs on the world.\n\nWhile the White House has played down such concerns, a vast wave of tariffs unveiled by Trump last spring – when he proclaimed the start of a new era for the US economy – was quickly reversed as global markets fell sharply.\n\nBut his administration’s erratic rollout of other tariffs nevertheless significantly strained US trade ties with the world. Americans now face an overall average effective tariff rate of 16.8%, according to the Budget Lab at Yale, the highest level since 1935.\n\nThe Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said recently that Greenland’s defence is a “common concern” for the whole of Nato. The Guardian reported that European troops had deployed to Greenland, in part, to establish what a more sustained ground deployment on the territory could look like, and partly to reassure the US that European Nato members were serious about Arctic security.\n\nFewer than one in five of Americans approve of Trump’s efforts to acquire Greenland, a poll published on Thursday by Reuters/Ipsos found. Both Democrats and Republicans oppose the effort, and only 4% of Americans think the US should take Greenland using military force.\n\nMuch of Trump’s wider trade strategy is currently in the hands of the US supreme court, which is mulling whether the imposition of many of his tariffs was legal. A decision could be announced as early as next week.",

    "description": "Post-training alignment often reduces LLM diversity, leading to a phenomenon known as mode collapse. Unlike prior work that attributes this effect to algorithmic limitations, we identify a fundamental, pervasive data-level driver: typicality bias in preference data, whereby annotators systematically favor familiar text as a result of well-established findings in cognitive psychology. We formalize this bias theoretically, verify it on preference datasets empirically, and show that it plays a central role in mode collapse. Motivated by this analysis, we introduce Verbalized Sampling, a simple, training-free prompting strategy to circumvent mode collapse.

    "fullText": "Back in 1993, Shoshanna Lonstein Gruss, then just Shoshanna Lonstein, became a tabloid darling because she dated Jerry Seinfeld at the height of his sitcom fame.\n\nThat was before you could be social media famous, but essentially, she was one of the first influencers, and she parlayed the fame of her four-year relationship into a successful career as a fashion designer.\n\nLonstein Gruss was a rare person, back in those days, who managed to turn fame by association into a real career. Her Shoshanna clothing brand was respected and enduring, not an attempt to capitalize on her name recognition, as happened with Monica Lewinsky's handbag line, or in a more recent example, Mike \"The Situation\" Sorrentino's \"Situation Nation” clothing line.\n\nShoshanna operates its own store, while also being sold at retailers including Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, and Bloomingdale's. It also has some items for sale on Amazon.\n\nNow the retail brand has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, on the same day that Saks Global and Neiman Marcus also filed. (It's important to note that the company behind the Shoshanna brand uses a slightly different spelling — i.e., Shoshanah Fashions.)\n\nLonstein Gruss may have started as a tabloid figure, but she has a deep history as a respected fashion designer.\n\n\"After 27 years of dedication and innovation, the Shoshanna collection has developed a legion of fans, including Mindy Kaling, Isla Fisher, Kelly Ripa, and The Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle. The collection can be found in luxury retailers like Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, Bloomingdale's, ShopBop, and Anthropologie as well as over 500 specialty stores in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia,\" the company shared on its website.\n\nShoshanah Fashions has not made a public statement about its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. The filing, however, came on the same day Saks Global filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nSaks Global's Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus are key distribution partners for Shoshanna Fashions, and the brand is almost certainly owed money by its partner, according to data shared with TheStreet by Ragini Bhalla, Head of Brand and Spokesperson for Creditsafe.\n\n\"Saks Inc. had a persistent and troubling pattern of paying vendors late in 2025,\npointing to sustained liquidity problems. Days Beyond Terms (DBT) refers to the\nnumber of days late (i.e., past payment terms) that a company pays its bills. One of the\nmost common indications that a company is struggling with cash flow is when its DBT is\nsignificantly higher than other companies in the same industry,\" the research showed.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — From toppling Venezuela's leader to ordering mass deportations, from turning once independent government entities into rubber stamps to demolishing the East Wing for a White House ballroom, President Donald Trump spent his first year back in office trampling political norms and testing institutional checks and balances.\n\nSome of his ideas that once seemed implausible, if not outright fanciful, are now reality. But there are other things that Trump could not deliver on.\n\n“I’ve kept all my promises and much more,” Trump insisted during a speech this week in Detroit.\n\nWith his administration nearing the one-year mark, here's a look at where some of his most jaw-dropping promises stand:\n\nIn progress: A new Qatari Air Force One\n\nU.S. defense officials in May accepted a luxury Boeing 747 jet from Qatar for Trump to eventually use as Air Force One, brushing aside ethical and legal questions and even anti-bribery constitutional provisions. The aircraft is being retrofitted in Texas to meet U.S. security and communications standards that are likely to cost about $400 million, the Air Force says. Outside experts estimate costs could approach $1 billion. Despite Trump's boasts that the work would be done in six months, completion may not actually occur until after he leaves office in January 2029.\n\nWhat's in progress: Annexing Greenland\n\nAfter the U.S. military's removal of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, Trump renewed his calls to take over the semiautonomous Danish territory, insisting the United States will “have” Greenland “one way or another.” The president also tapped Gov. Jeff Landry, R-La., as the special U.S. envoy to Greenland, with a nod to the 1803 Louisiana Purchase from France that doubled the size of the U.S. Denmark says it is not ceding the world's largest island and that any invasion could have geopolitical implications given that Denmark is a NATO ally.\n\nTrump has tried to denigrate his predecessor, Joe Biden, by accusing the Democrat of overreliance on the autopen to sign presidential pardons, legislation and other key documents, despite the fact that Trump and other presidents have also used the tool. In October, a GOP-controlled House committee released a report alleging misuse of the autopen by the Biden administration. Trump's Department of Justice is investigating.\n\nThe president has said he wants to reopen an “expanded and rebuilt” Alcatraz, the notorious San Francisco Bay prison that has been closed for six-plus decades, to house immigration detainees. William K. Marshall III, the director of the Bureau of Prisons, toured the island in July. His agency announced that engineers and planners were developing design concepts, preliminary budgets and logistical models.\n\nTrump has posted on social media about extending traditional home mortgages repayments from 30 years to 50 years, suggesting that this could ease concerns about housing affordability. Economists say the switch would make it harder to build wealth through home ownership. Nonetheless, the White House has pledged to push the change. Officials have made little headway since, however, and Trump instead has looked to reduce mortgage rates by having the federal government buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds.\n\nTrump has frequently toyed with the idea of a third term, despite the Constitution stating that no one can be elected president “more than twice.” He acknowledged in October, “I would say that if you read it, it’s pretty clear I’m not allowed to run. It’s too bad.” White House chief of staff Susie Wiles also told Vanity Fair that Trump “knows he can’t run again.” Still, Trump mused this month, “I’m not allowed to run? I’m not sure,” and suggested there could be “a constitutional movement” to make that happen.\n\nWhat's faded away: Making Canada the 51st state\n\nDespite it being far-fetched, Trump has talked about making America's northern neighbor the “Great State of Canada” since before his second term started. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney assured Trump during a subsequent White House visit that his country “won’t be for sale, ever.” Carney suggested in June that Trump had lost interest. Trump has continued to bring up the idea, though, including during a September speech to military personnel in Virginia.\n\nTrump suggested in February that billionaire Elon Musk would be checking out Fort Knox in Kentucky to ensure that U.S. gold reserves were still there. The president even floated the notion of tagging along. Nothing came of that, however, and Musk has left the administration.\n\nSending thousands of migrants to Guantanamo\n\nThe president pledged to ship up to 30,000 of the “worst criminal aliens” to a U.S. Navy lockup in Cuba, and between February and June, about 500 immigrants were held there. But those numbers have since declined and sometimes reached zero. Housing migrants at Guantanamo is more expensive than in traditional detention centers, and doing so has drawn legal challenges.\n\nGaza Strip as a Mediterranean Sea resort\n\nTrump repeatedly suggested that the U.S. would take over war-torn Gaza and move out the Palestinians living there, and that U.S. developers could turn the area into a “Riviera of the Middle East,” after the war between Israel and Hamas. Gaza's reconstruction is a key question amid a Trump administration-brokered ceasefire, but Arab nations have rejected the idea of it being a vacation spot. Trump no longer mentions it.\n\nThe president says his tariffs could raise enough revenue for most Americans to get $2,000 payments. But he also has pledged to spend that same money on plugging deficits created by tax cuts, reducing the national debt, keeping a key nutrition program for low-income mothers and children funded during last year's government shutdown, aiding farmers and adding to defense spending for 2027. The U.S. collected about $289 billion in tariff revenue last year, which would be well short of what rebate checks would cost, even without the other promised earmarks. Trump also promised that slashing the size of federal government would give Americans rebate checks, but those never materialized.\n\nEliminating the federal income tax\n\nTrump has frequently said that steep import tariffs “will be enough to cut all of the income tax,” long suggesting that the U.S. was better off during the Gilded Age, when there was no income tax and federal revenue came largely from tariffs. “If you go back to the 1800s, 1887,” he said Friday, “We had money, so much money, we didn’t know what to do with it.” Lately, however, his administration has more often been promoting how much his tax and spending law might reduce 2026 tax bills for many Americans.\n\nTrump hates the dynamic kickoff, calling it a “demeaning” and “unromantic” affront to football's “pageantry.” By November, Trump was suggesting the NFL didn't “have the right to do that to the game” while acknowledging, “I don’t think they’ll change.”\n\nWhat's been accomplished: Bringing back the War Department\n\nTrump signed an executive order in September aiming to rename the Department of Defense as the Department of War. It will take an act of Congress to make the change lawful.\n\nThe board of trustees of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, stocked with Trump loyalists, voted in December to add Trump's name to Washington's premier performing arts venue, memorializing the 35th president. The move drew show cancellations and a lawsuit. The Kennedy Center is named by statute and would need Congress' approval for a legal change.\n\nReducing Chinese influence on the Panama Canal\n\nTrump suggested before his second term that the U.S. might retake control of the Panama Canal because Panama had failed to check Chinese influence over the waterway. His administration then pressured China to have the Hong Kong-based operator of ports at both ends of the canal sell those interests to a U.S. consortium, though that process faced delays. Panama withdrew from China's Belt and Road investment program in Latin America, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited Panama in April and agreed to bolster security coordination.\n\nThe president announced in December that his long-promised “ gold card ” was going on sale. It offers legal status, and an eventual pathway to U.S. citizenship, for individuals paying $1 million and corporations ponying up twice that per foreign-born employee, plus an upfront $15,000 fee to cover screening costs. The program is meant to replace EB-5 visas, which offered permanent U.S. residency in exchange for foreign investors spending a bit more than $1 million on a business that creates at least 10 full-time jobs for American workers.\n\nSince tearing down the East Wing, construction crews have worked into the night, hustling to finish the massive ballroom before Trump's term ends. The president initially said the structure, set to be bigger than the White House itself, would cost $200 million but he now says $400 million. He has promised that it will be paid for by himself and private donors. The White House has released only a partial list of who is actually contributing and has argued that parts of the project's plans are “ top secret.”\n\nMore to watch: Possible US military action in Colombia, Mexico and Iran\n\nFollowing the U.S. operation in Venezuela, Trump accused Colombian President Gustavo Petro of “making cocaine and selling it to the United States” and said U.S intervention in that country “sounds good to me.” After a friendly call with Petro, however, Trump suggested that “the situation of drugs and other disagreements” had been defused. Trump, though, also maintains that Mexico is “run” by drug cartels and says, “You have to do something with Mexico.” He's warned Iran that if that country starts “killing people like they have in the past” during a recent round of sweeping, anti-government protests, then “they are going to get hit very hard by the United States.” Killings have run into the thousands, but by Friday, Trump appeared to be backing off those threats.\n\nCuba collapsing with or without US intervention\n\nTrump has repeatedly noted Cuba's weakened position since the U.S. captured Maduro, whose country was a major ally of the communist-run island. Trump has said Cuba “only survives because of Venezuela” and is “ready to fall” without the U.S. intervening. Venezuela's economic and social chaos and Maduro's ouster have raised questions about Cuba's future. But Trump has also suggested Cuba “make a deal, BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE,” without saying what that means.\n\nTrump says he wants a Golden Dome missile defense program — a multilayered, $175 billion system that would put U.S. weapons in space for the first time — to be fully operational by January 2029. Defense officials say more likely all that will be achieved by then is some initial capability for the system. It is envisioned to include ground- and space-based capabilities that can detect and stop missiles at various stages of attack.\n\nTrump said he talked to Rob Manfred before Major League Baseball's commissioner reinstated Cincinnati Reds slugger Pete Rose in May. Rose died in 2024 but still faced a baseball ban over betting on the game, despite having a record 4,256 career hits. Trump now wants Rose in the Hall of Fame, but that's up to the Hall’s Classic Baseball Committee, which likely will not meet until at least December 2027.\n\nThe fourth installment of the cop buddy-comedy series starring Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan will be coming out after a reported request from Trump. Paramount, which is co-owned by David Ellison, son of Oracle co-founder and Trump megadonor Larry Ellison, is set to distribute the film. Semafor reported that Trump had asked Ellison to help revive the franchise. Warner Bros. released the first three “Rush Hour” films, but eschewed the fourth after earlier sexual misconduct allegations against its director, Brett Ratner. Ratner also made a documentary on first lady Melania Trump.",

    "description": "In the 12 days since the U.S. seized Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, interim President Delcy Rodriguez has been working to consolidate her own power, installing loyalists in",
    "fullText": "Jan 17 (Reuters) - In the 12 days since the U.S. seized Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, interim President Delcy Rodriguez has been working to consolidate her own power, installing loyalists in key positions to protect herself from internal threats while meeting U.S. demands to boost oil production.\n\nRodriguez, 56, a quiet but rigorous technocrat who was vice president and oil minister, has named a central banker to help run the economy, a presidential chief of staff and, crucially, a new head of Venezuela’s feared DGCIM, the military counterintelligence agency ​built over decades with Cuban assistance.\n\nMajor General Gustavo Gonzalez, 65, will now head the agency, a move three sources with knowledge of the government described as an early gambit by Rodriguez to counter what many in Venezuela say is the biggest threat to her leadership: Diosdado ‌Cabello, Venezuela's hardline interior minister with close ties to the security services and the dreaded “colectivos” motorcycle gangs which have killed opposition supporters.\n\n\"She is very clear that she doesn't have the capacity to survive without the consent of the Americans,\" said one source close to the government. \"She's already reforming the armed forces, removing people and naming new officials.\"\n\nInterviews with seven sources in Venezuela, including diplomats, business ‌people and politicians, reveal in previously unreported detail the fault line at the heart of Venezuela's government and the risks it poses to Rodriguez as she tries to consolidate internal control while meeting Trump administration dictates on oil sales. The sources spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.\n\nThe tightrope Rodriguez is attempting to walk was evident in her first major speech since taking office. Addressing parliament in a national annual address on Thursday, she called for unity, stressed her bona fides as Maduro’s loyal deputy, and vowed to forge a new chapter in Venezuela’s politics with increased oil investment.\n\nVenezuela’s communications ministry, which handles all press inquiries for the government and individual officials, did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\n\nThe White House responded to emailed questions from Reuters by referring the news agency to recent comments made by Trump. In an interview with Reuters on Wednesday, Trump said Rodriguez \"has been very good to deal with\" and that he expected her to visit ⁠Washington at some point.\n\nRodriguez - nicknamed \"the tsarina\" for her business connections - has broad influence over the country's ‌civilian levers of power, including the crucial oil industry, and now also enjoys the backing of the United States. That backing appeared to be reemphasized on Thursday when Rodriguez met with CIA director John Ratcliffe in Caracas.\n\nThe other main faction is led by Cabello.\n\nCabello, who also heads the ruling PSUV socialist party, is a former soldier with a weekly four-hour show on state television, which has run for 12 years. His first public act after Maduro's capture was to appear on screen ‍dressed in a flak jacket and surrounded by armed guards as he led a chant of, \"To doubt is to betray.”\n\nOfficials in the Trump administration had contact with Cabello months before the operation to seize Maduro and have also been in communication with him since, four sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, warning him against using the security services or colectivos to target the opposition.\n\nCabello, who was jailed in Venezuela for backing eventual socialist President Hugo Chavez in a failed 1992 coup, is under indictment in the U.S. and has a $25 million reward for his capture.\n\nSo far Cabello has been conciliatory towards Rodriguez, saying they are “very united” and he arrived at Thursday's national address alongside Rodriguez and her ​brother Jorge, the head of the national assembly. But sources with knowledge of their relationship told Reuters that Cabello remains the biggest threat to her ability to govern.\n\nIn Caracas, security forces are skittish. A few hours after Rodriguez was sworn in, there was a brief burst of anti-aircraft fire outside ‌the presidential palace that some feared could be another U.S. attack. Instead, reports suggest it was a miscommunication between police and the presidential guard, which shot down police drones. The government said the craft were spy drones, without explaining who they belonged to.\n\nAcross the country, people are reeling from the shock of Maduro’s capture and unsure whether to be hopeful or scared. In some places, local socialist party branches have asked members to spy on their neighbors and report anyone celebrating Maduro’s downfall, according to three party members who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nIn this tense environment, Rodriguez must persuade party loyalists that she is not a U.S. puppet who betrayed Maduro. She must also stabilize an economy that saw prices for basic goods soar in the days since the U.S. attack, as well as wrestle some degree of control over the sprawling military-linked patronage networks that have developed over decades of Chavismo rule.\n\nVenezuela has as many as 2,000 generals and admirals, more than double the number in the United States, a military superpower with 20 times more active duty and reserve troops. Senior and retired officers control food distribution, raw materials and the state oil company PDVSA, while dozens of generals sit on the boards of private firms.\n\nMany officials are able to run ⁠their regional fiefdoms as they see fit - ordering patrols or checkpoints by soldiers under their command - and some parts of the country and capital Caracas have seen increased activity ​by security services since Maduro's capture.\n\nREPRESSION ‘ALREADY HAS A NAME’\n\nGonzalez, the new head of the military counterintelligence agency DGCIM, has over his long career in Venezuela’s government worked closely with Cabello, particularly during ​two stints as head of the separate civilian spy agency.\n\nYet it is to Rodriguez that Gonzalez owes his most recent posts. In 2024, Rodriguez tapped Gonzalez for a top job at the state oil company, Venezuela’s most important company and the engine of the country’s economy.\n\nQuestions still remain over how much control Gonzalez will be able to exert over DGCIM. Cabello's allies within the agency could undermine him, the three sources with knowledge of the government said.\n\nOne source with knowledge of the inner workings ‍of the security services said Gonzalez's DGCIM predecessor General Javier Marcano struggled to control ⁠the agency.\n\n\"The role of boss of repression already has a name… Diosdado,\" this person said. \"Marcano was coordinating with (civilian) militias and with the colectivos, but he had serious difficulties controlling DGCIM because his designation was nominal.\"\n\nThe colectivos, closely connected to Cabello, could also make the country ungovernable by implementing a so-called \"anarchization\" strategy, which was first designed to fend off U.S. intervention but could be directed ⁠against Rodriguez, the source close to the government told Reuters. That strategy would mobilize the intelligence services and colectivos to plunge Caracas into disorder and chaos.\n\nCabello could also slow the pace of prisoner releases that have been hailed by Trump. They have been proceeding much more slowly than demanded by families and rights groups, creating a potential pressure point for Rodriguez.\n\nOutside of Venezuela, ‌however, pressure on Cabello continues to mount.\n\n\"For the Trump administration to achieve a real transition in Venezuela, sooner or later Diosdado Cabello must face U.S. justice,\" U.S. Representative Maria Elvira Salazar said on X this month. \"When Diosdado is brought to justice, it will be ‌a decisive step toward a democratic transition in Venezuela and the release of all political hostages.\"",

    "fullText": "Cleveland Metroparks marked a wildlife milestone that had conservationists and scientists buzzing: trail cameras recorded a fisher, a medium-sized mammal in the weasel family — and this was verified as the first sighting of the species in Cuyahoga County in more than 100 years, Fox 8 reported.\n\n\"This is tremendously exciting,\" reads the caption from Cleveland Metroparks' Instagram post, which reflects on the significance of the sighting for both the region's natural history and ongoing conservation efforts.\n\nFishers disappeared from this part of Ohio in the mid-1800s, mainly due to trapping and habitat loss, the post detailed. Their return signals the success of long-term restoration and smart management of local environments.\n\nTrail cameras, like the ones used in the Cleveland area, are convenient and powerful tools that help wildlife experts monitor population health, track movements, and gather evidence of rehabilitation and species recovery.\n\nEach captured image contributes to a broader understanding of how native species are reestablishing themselves. They give communities insight into the health of their local ecosystems.\n\nThe role of trail cameras in conservation is significant. Recently, trail cameras captured unique footage of a grizzly bear in the Yukon and a leopard in West Coast National Park in South Africa.\n\nThe resurgence of species like the fisher carries benefits that ripple beyond the woods.\n\nHealthy wildlife populations help support balanced ecosystems, which humans also rely on for food, water, and clean air. Communities can take pride in conservation victories, seeing firsthand that their efforts pay off and that people can positively impact their surroundings.\n\nThe return of a species after a century shows that thoughtful environmental management can foster biodiversity, helping ecosystems thrive alongside human development.\n\nFor Cleveland Metroparks and the Ohio Division of Wildlife, the fisher's appearance is a reminder that conservation works.\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nTrail cameras won't just document these rare moments; they will also help guide continued efforts to protect species and habitats, proving that even a century-old absence can have a hopeful comeback story.\n\n\"Phenomenal,\" said one local resident when learning of the fisher's reappearance.\n\nAnother said: \"This is huge!!! The conservation and natural recovery efforts of this state are nothing short of astounding.\"\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

At the time, Agnel admitted the incidents occurred, but denied that any coercion took place.\n\nThat year, France passed a law that defined sex with a child under the age of 15 — France's age of consent — as rape. It is now punishable by up to 20 years in jail.\n\nIn July 2024, Agnel, who retired from swimming in 2016, attended a meeting with the victim, who is now in her early 20s, that he had requested, per Le Monde.\n\nWant to keep up with the latest crime coverage? \n\nAgnel won gold in the 200m freestyle and the 4x100m freestyle relay at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. He qualified for the 2016 Games in Rio, but failed to get through the heats that year. He announced his retirement from the sport soon after.\n\nIf you or someone you know has been sexually assaulted, please contact the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-656-HOPE (4673) or go to rainn.org.",

    "description": "Visits to the US by international travelers declined for the eighth straight month in December, in a continued blow to the tourism industry.",
    "fullText": "The US isn't the tourist destination it once was.\n\nVisits to the US by international travelers declined for the eighth straight month in December, according to data released earlier this month by the National Travel and Tourism Office.\n\nIn 2025, visits to the US were down among 10 of the top 20 overseas tourist-generating countries, including India, Germany, and South Korea.\n\nThe decline is a sustained blow to the travel and tourism industries, which in 2024 supported more than 15 million jobs, and generated about $1.3 trillion in economic output — including $181 billion from inbound international travel.\n\nMajor tourism hubs like Las Vegas are seeing widespread layoffs due to the downturn, forcing workers to get creative with their career pivots. Business Insider reported earlier this month that laid-off hospitality workers contributed to a 55% increase in dancer auditions at a Las Vegas strip club compared to the prior six months.\n\nIt doesn't appear the travel bug has gone anywhere — just that international tourists are avoiding the US.\n\nIn Australia, for example, overseas arrivals and departures data released Friday by the country's Bureau of Statistics shows that international travel returned to pre-pandemic levels just before the lockdowns began in 2020. Australians travelling to Canada rose 4% in the last year, 10% more visited India, and visits by Australians to China and Japan rose 20% and 21%, respectively, but 3.2% fewer booked a trip to the US.\n\nFewer Canadian travelers are visiting the US, as well, opting instead to go further south to Mexico, Business Insider reported last April.\n\nComplicating demand were ongoing trade frictions, tariff battles, and geopolitical unease, which helped fuel grass-roots boycotts of US goods and, in some cases, changes in travel plans.\n\nEuropean travel firms and analysts pointed to tariff-driven consumer backlash and growing anti-American sentiment as factors that contributed to early-year softness in bookings, even as demand showed signs of rebounding later in the summer.\n\nDomestic travel has helped cushion the blow so far, with the US Travel Association projecting that domestic leisure travel was forecast to grow 1.9% to $895 billion in 2025.\n\nHowever, if international visitors continue to stay away, destinations that depend on overseas spending — from iconic tourism cities to national parks — could feel growing pressure as the US heads into a high-stakes stretch of global events in 2026 and beyond.",

    "fullText": "Netflix wants to change the way action movies are made amid the never-ending battle for our sustained attention, according to \"Bourne\" actor Matt Damon.\n\nIn an interview on the \"Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast, Damon and longtime collaborator and friend Ben Affleck spoke about their latest experience costarring in and coproducing their first Netflix-exclusive heist film, \"The Rip,\" which was released Friday. The two actors talked about how streaming and short-form video platforms have upended the way movies are consumed, made, and sold to audiences.\n\nDamon said Netflix is now asking for action films to have bigger sequences occur within the first five minutes of the movie and suggesting that actors reiterate the plot line to cater to viewers who are on their phones.\n\nThe actor said the \"standard way\" he learned to make an action film was to have the finale — \"the big one with all the explosions\" that a production spends most of its money on — occur in the third act.\n\n\"Now, they're like, 'Can we get a big one in the first five minutes? We want people to stay tuned in. And you know it wouldn't be terrible if you reiterated the plot three or four times in the dialogue because people are on their phones while they're watching,'\" he said. \"And so then it's going to really start to infringe on how we're telling a story.\"\n\nDamon didn't specify if Netflix gave the instruction to the actor and producer for his latest heist movie.\n\nA Netflix spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment sent during the weekend.\n\nAffleck added that the suggestions aren't reflected in every new action film or series coming out on Netflix. The actor pointed to \"Adolescence,\" a crime miniseries that has episodes shot in one continuous take. The show was released in March.\n\nDamon said he felt the show was an exception.\n\n\"My feeling is just that it demonstrates that you don't need to do any of that\" stuff, Affleck said.\n\nHe later added, \"It's like supply and demand. People want to look at their phones, they look at TikTok, they're going to do that. I think what you can do is make shit the best you can. Make it really good.\"",

    "fullText": "Buffalo quarterback Josh Allen was in tears as he addressed the media after the Denver Broncos beat the Bills to move within one win of the Super Bowl.\n\nAllen had a chance to clinch victory in overtime but his fifth turnover of Saturday's Divisional Round game allowed the Broncos to kick a field goal and win 33-30.\n\nThat means that despite reaching the play-offs in seven straight seasons, the NFL's reigning Most Valuable Player is still to reach the sport's biggest game.\n\nThe 29-year-old also has the most play-off wins by a quarterback without playing in a Super Bowl (eight).\n\n\"It's extremely difficult,\" said an emotional Allen. \"I feel like I let my team-mates down tonight.\n\n\"Missed opportunities throughout the game. It's been a long season, I hate how it ended and it's going to stick with me for a long time.\"\n\nIn Saturday's other match-up, the Seattle Seahawks romped to a 41-6 win over the San Francisco 49ers.",

    "description": "Griffin Canning pitched for the New York Mets in 2025.",
    "fullText": "According to a new report from Jon Heyman of the New York Post, the St. Louis Cardinals are interested in rehabbing free agent starting pitcher Griffin Canning, who spent the 2025 campaign with the New York Mets.\n\nThe Mets have shown interest in bringing back Griffin Canning, who should be ready around Opening Day after suffering an Achilles tear last year. The Cardinals and White Sox also are interested.\n\nNow 29 years old, Canning is a six-year veteran of the Los Angeles Angels and Mets. He's gone 32-37 in his career with a 4.65 ERA. He had a career-high seven wins in 2023, and again in 2025 before getting hurt. He was 7-3 with a 3.77 ERA in 16 starts for the Mets. He hasn't traditionally struck out a lot of batters, but he had 70 Ks in 76.1 innings a season ago, signaling that perhaps he's unlocked more swing-and-miss stuff.\n\nThe Cardinals could be interested in a veteran innings-eater to help keep the pressure off young prospects like Quinn Matthews and Liam Doyle. Even though it's unclear exactly when he'd be able to return to a big-league rotation, he should be able to provide good cover for those prospects. The Cardinals may be able to trade him for a prospect at the trade deadline, or perhaps they could ink him to a multi-year deal, allowing him to rehab and work through things in 2026, while flipping him at some point in 2027.\n\nThe Cardinals are rebuilding, but they should be able to provide Canning with opportunities to rebuild his value. If he's looking for a promised rotation spot and an opportunity to impress people ahead of 2027, he could take a one-year deal in St. Louis. He could also end up being dealt to a contender at the deadline, giving him a chance to win a World Series.\n\nMatthew Liberatore, Dustin May and Andre Pallante are assured rotation spots, with Richard Fitts and Hunter Dobbins likely serving as options once they are recovered from their 2025 injuries. Beyond them, Doyle and Matthews are waiting.\n\nThe one that could impact Canning negatively? Perhaps there's too many variables, too many prospects and too many possibilities in the rotation as is. Maybe the rotation spot isn't guaranteed all year, which could scare him to an organization with more security.\n\nRemember to join our CARDINALS on ROUNDTABLE community, which is FREE!

    "fullText": "New Jersey Devils forward Jesper Bratt is set to play his 600th NHL game tonight as the Devils take on the Hurricanes.\n\nBratt made his NHL debut against the Hurricanes in October 2017. Ahead of his milestone game, Bratt shared his thoughts with NJD.tv.\n\n“It’s really special. Time goes fast,” Bratt said. “Super honored and happy to be doing it here in the same place and in front of the same fans I did my first game. It’s going to be a special time.”\n\nIn 599 NHL games, Bratt has scored 161 goals and 322 assists. Over his nine seasons with the Devils, Bratt has become a key contributor.\n\nReflecting on Bratt’s journey since being drafted in the sixth round (162nd pick), head coach Sheldon Keefe offered his perspective on the forward’s career.\n\n\"When I've been asked about him and reflect on him and what I observe is a guy that works extremely hard, is extremely focused and disciplined,\" Keefe said. \"How he prepares, how he seeks to improve, how he accepts coaching and information. In that sense, he's an easy guy to coach because he's all about getting better and all about helping the team.\"\n\nThis season, Bratt has appeared in 47 games, earning 36 points (11 G, 25 A). Keefe continued to highlight the left winger’s accomplishments.\n\n“From where he was drafted to how quickly he got into the league to how he found ways to be successful despite being an undersized guy to being a premier player in the league,\" Keefe said. \"Quite a story, great accomplishment for him. I feel like he's just getting started.\"\n\nThe puck will drop at 7 PM tonight.\n\nake sure you bookmark THN's New Jersey Devils site for THN's latest news, exclusive interviews, breakdowns, and so much more.\n\nFor action-packed issues, access to the entire magazine archive and a free issue, com/free. Get the latest news and trending stories by subscribing to our newsletter here. And share your thoughts by commenting below the article on THN.com or creating your own post in our community forum.",

    "fullText": "NFL playoffs overtime rules, explained: How tie games are decided compared to regular season, preseason originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nCan an NFL playoff game end in a tie?\n\nNFL overtime rules for playoff games\n\nNFL overtime rules for regular season\n\nNFL overtime rules for preseason\n\nHistory of NFL playoff overtime rules\n\nPlayoff football tends to be neck-and-neck. Sometimes, it even requires some extra time.\n\nWhile no games in last year's NFL playoffs required overtime, it wasn't too long ago that the Super Bowl went an extra frame, when the Kansas City Chiefs took down the San Francisco 49ers to go back-to-back in February 2024 on a game-winning touchdown pass in overtime.\n\nGiven the nature of the postseason, NFL overtime rules are a bit different in the playoffs vs. the regular season. Most notably, the playoff rules prioritize giving both teams a chance to win, something that changed in recent years.\n\nHere's everything to know about how the 2026 NFL playoff overtime rules work, and how they compare to the regular season and preseason.\n\nMORE: Everything to know about the NFL's virtual measurement system\n\nNo, an NFL playoff game cannot end in a tie. In the preseason and regular season, games can end in ties. However, with the league needing a team to move on to the next round of the playoffs, there is no possibility of a tie in the postseason.\n\nTeams will play more overtime periods until a tie is broken in the playoffs.\n\nMORE: How does NFL MVP voting work?\n\nThe NFL's newest overtime rules for playoff games were implemented in the 2023 postseason. The biggest change was largely in response to the 2022 AFC Championship Game between the Chiefs and Bills, guaranteeing that both teams would get a possession in overtime.\n\nHere's how OT works for playoff games via the NFL rulebook:\n\nIf the score is still tied at the end of an overtime period — or if the second team’s initial possession has not ended — the teams will play another overtime period. There can be no ties in the playoffs. Play will continue regardless of how many overtime periods are needed for a winner to be determined.\n\nThere will be a two-minute intermission between each overtime period. There will not be a halftime intermission after the second period.\n\nThe captain who lost the first overtime coin toss will either choose to possess the ball or select which goal his team will defend, unless the team that won the coin toss deferred that choice.\n\nEach team will have an opportunity to possess the ball in overtime.\n\nEach team gets three timeouts during a half.\n\nThe same timing rules that apply at the end of the second and fourth regulation periods also apply at the end of a second or fourth overtime period.\n\nIf there is still no winner at the end of a fourth overtime period, there will be another coin toss, and play will continue until a winner is declared.\n\nRegardless of whether the team who receives the opening overtime kickoff scores a touchdown, the other team is guaranteed a possession.  However, the game is over if a safety or defensive touchdown is scored.\n\nIf the game is tied after both teams possess the ball once, then the next score wins.\n\nMORE: Explaining how the NCAA OT format works and differences from NFL\n\nIn comparison to the postseason, overtime in the NFL regular season is a bit different, mostly because games can end in ties.\n\nHere are the official regular season overtime rules, via the NFL rulebook:\n\nAt the end of regulation, the referee will toss a coin to determine which team will possess the ball first in overtime. The visiting team captain will call the toss.\n\nNo more than one 10-minute period will follow a three-minute intermission. Each team must possess, or have the opportunity to possess, the ball, rather than one team being able to win the game by scoring on its first overtime possession. The exception is if the team kicking off to start the overtime period scores a safety on the receiving team’s initial possession, then the team that kicked off is the winner.\n\nSudden death play — where the game ends on any score (safety, field goal or touchdown) — continues until a winner is determined after each team has had an opportunity to possess the ball.\n\nThe point after try is not attempted if the game ends on a touchdown.\n\nIf the score is still tied at the end of the overtime period, the result of the game will be recorded as a tie.\n\nThere are no instant replay coach’s challenges; all reviews will be initiated by the replay official.\n\nMORE:Breaking down the NFL's newest kickoff rules\n\nThe most straightforward NFL overtime rules come in the preseason: there is no overtime. With. games not counting for much in the preseason, the league doesn't bother to try and break ties.\n\nThat change was made in 2021, prioritizing player health and safety in games that do not have any bearing on the standings. Players can be evaluated from the first through fourth quarters, and no extra periods are necessary.\n\nMORE: Why does the NFL allow ties in the regular season?\n\nA lot has changed since the first NFL game to go to overtime on Aug. 28, 1955, between the Rams and Giants. That game was played under “sudden death” rules, and the Rams won. From there, the overtime format was fully introduced.\n\nThe NFL moved forward with that model before implementing sudden-death overtime for regular-season games 16 years later. In the original format, the first team to score any points at all won the game. That included kicking a game-winning field goal. “Sudden death” remained the format for 35 years.\n\nIn 2010, the playoff overtime rules were tweaked. For teams that received the ball first, a field goal no longer counted as a game-ender in “sudden death.” Under the change, only a touchdown on the first possession of overtime could win the game in the playoffs. Otherwise, the other team would get a possession.\n\nThat format was added to the preseason and regular season in 2012.\n\nThe length of overtime was altered in 2017, decreasing from a full 15 minutes to just 10 minutes.\n\nIn 2021, overtime was removed from preseason games, with the NFL citing player safety to avoid unnecessary periods.\n\nMost recently, the NFL changed the playoff overtime rules in 2022, assuring both teams would get at least one possession in overtime of a postseason game. Regardless of whether the first team scored a touchdown, the other team was given a shot to tie the game or come back to win it. If the score remained tied after each team had a possession, then “sudden death” began.\n\nMORE: What is considered a catch in the NFL?\n\nHere are the six longest NFL games ever, all of which went deep into overtime. Because regular season games can end in ties, the longest overtime games all consist of playoff games.\n\nAll six of the games below required two overtime periods to decide a winner.\n\nAFC Divisional Round (Dolphins vs. Chiefs)\n\nAFL Championship (Texans vs. Oilers)\n\nAFC Divisional Round (Browns vs. Jets)\n\nAFC Divisional Round (Ravens vs. Broncos)\n\nAFC Divisional Round (Raiders vs. Colts)\n\nNFC Divisional Round (Panthers vs. Rams)\n\nMORE:What is Scorigami in the NFL?",

    "description": "Philadelphia Phillies hitting coach believes Bryce Harper could be better in a key area.",
    "fullText": "The big narrative surrounding Bryce Harper this offseason is whether or not the eight-time All-Star and two-time MVP is still an “elite” player. A debate that Philadelphia Phillies president Dave Dombrowski sparked with a comment during a media availability earlier this winter.\n\nWhether Harper is an elite player is subjective, but there is one area he could improve upon heading into the 2026 season, which Kevin Long recently detailed during an appearance on MLB Network Radio.\n\nThe Phillies' hitting coach detailed how Harper must improve his strike-zone awareness and plate discipline.\n\n“Bryce needs to make sure his strike zone is better than it was last year. I mean, going there this year,\" Long said. \"He sees the least amount of strikes in all of baseball. If that's the case, then we gotta be a little more disciplined in our own. So there's always something.\"\n\nIt’s important to note that Long by no means was calling out Harper or singling the slugger out. The coach was talking about how everyone on the roster has areas for improvement.\n\nThat said, Harper having better plate discipline is a fair criticism and area of improvement ot focus on. Harper has always been a free-swinging type player, but his discipline during the 2025 season wasn’t great.\n\nHarper had a chase-rate of 35.6 percent and a whiff-rate of 30.7 percent, both of which were among his career-highs in those categories. Still, the slugger managed to slash .261/.357/.487 with an OPS of .844, including 27 home runs and 32 doubles.\n\nEven with the high whiff and chase rate, Harper was still a productive hitter. Now, just imagine what he could get back to if Harper can make some of the adjustments Long is proposing.\n\nWhen talking about Harper and the rest of the Phillies roster, Long continued, “there are things these guys can do and work on. That sometimes it's my idea, sometimes it's theirs, but we'll attack those areas and try to get better.”\n\nIf Harper can make some of these small adjustments and be a little more selective with what he’s swinging at, he could, in return, be more productive and impactful at the plate.",

Cronin shouldered the blame for the loss, not because of any specific failure of coaching, but because he was the one that recruited and signed the players that he now feels are inept at defending strong opponents and lack the willingness to put themselves on the line physically.\n\n\"Our defense is an embarrassment today. Last couple games it was great. Today, we couldn't guard them... We had nobody interested in rising to the challenge defensively. Everybody wants somebody else to get the dirty work. We're a team that struggles to have dirty work guys,\" Cronin said.\n\nEffort is something that Cronin takes very seriously. Throughout the season, especially after bad games, Cronin has lambasted his team for an unwillingness to make hard plays, whether that's been on the rebounding front or in guarding the other team.\n\nThe Bruins have shown flashes of defensive effort at times, but never enough to chain together a consistent streak of wins. UCLA was riding a two-game win streak going into Saturday's game, which was a brief reprieve from the struggles they'd had in the previous two games, but their flaws reared their ugly heads again.\n\nThe Bruins were especially outclassed when it came to rebounding, a major point of contention for Cronin. The Buckeyes out-rebounded the Bruins 37-27 and had 12 more defenisve rebounds in particular. It was a hard shooting day for UCLA overall, but they kept up with Ohio State in most other stats beyond rebounding, which became the difference maker as any extra chances UCLA might have had were stripped away again and again by their inability to keep the ball away from the Buckeyes in the glass.\n\nThe biggest failure of the Bruins in Saturday's game was by far their handling of the Buckeyes' star guards senior Bruce Thornton or sophomore John Mobley Jr. Cronin said that UCLA had plenty of time to prep for those two in particular, but no one in blue could keep up, or even tried to.\n\nMobley Jr. led the Buckeyes with 28 points while Thornton turned in a 21 point, eight rebound performance.\n\n\"Two really tough guards and we knew that coming into the game. We've just to be more ready to play and step up to the fight,\" Bilodeau said.",

    "fullText": "Mavericks guard Klay Thompson saw Utah Jazz forward Ace Bailey crowding him on the perimeter and decided to teach the rookie a lesson.\n\nWith Bailey face-guarding him, the future Hall of Famer simply rose up and shot over the rookie for one of his six first-half 3-pointers. Moments later, with second-year forward Cody Williams — the younger brother of NBA champion Jalen Williams — closing hard, Thompson again elevated and drilled another shot over the contest.\n\nThompson caught fire early, scoring all 23 of his points in the first half.\n\nAlong the way, he moved into fourth place on the NBA’s all-time list for made 3-pointers, passing Damian Lillard during Saturday’s game against the Jazz. Only James Harden, Ray Allen and Stephen Curry now sit ahead of him.\n\nThompson continued his historic pace by knocking down a turnaround jumper at the 4:56 mark of the first quarter to reach 17,000 career points. He became the 109th player in NBA history to reach the milestone.\n\nThompson’s big night helped the Mavericks beat the Jazz 138-120 at the American Airlines Center on Saturday evening.\n\nThe game marked the fourth and final regular-season meeting between the teams. With the win, Dallas split the series, with the home team winning all four games.",

    "description": "The 49ers will be without tight end George Kittle in the divisional round of the playoffs. Here's the latest Kittle injury update:",
    "fullText": "As the San Francisco 49ers and Seattle Seahawks begin their NFL playoffs clash in the divisional round, one star player is conspicuously absent.\n\nWhat happened to George Kittle? And when could the 49ers' tight end return?\n\nIn last week's wild-card round game against the Philadelphia Eagles, Kittle tore his right Achilles tendon after catching a pass in the second quarter. The 49ers tight end had to be carted back to the locker room and was quickly ruled out of the remainder of the game with an Achilles injury. Head coach Kyle Shanahan confirmed to reporters after the game that Kittle had torn his Achilles.\n\nNFL NEWS, TAKES, FANTASY ADVICE: USA TODAY Sports has you covered with our NFL vodcast\n\nSan Francisco officially placed Kittle on injured reserve on Jan. 13. The 49ers' star tight end was scheduled to undergo surgery to repair the torn tendon on Jan. 14, according to Shanahan.\n\nHere's what to know about Kittle's status moving forward:\n\n49ERS AT SEAHAWKS: Predictions, picks, odds for NFL Divisional Round\n\nKittle's season is officially over after the 49ers placed their lead tight end on injured reserve. He will have to wait until next season for his return.\n\n\"Football sucks sometimes,\" Kittle wrote in an Instagram post. \"But I love it. I love these guys and this team. Heartbroken but have felt so much love and support from everyone reaching out. I’ll be good. Thank you. We aren’t done yet! Also when your team owner is the first person to meet you in the locker room, you know you’re in a special place. Cheers, all my love.\"\n\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, the rehab process following a surgery to repair a ruptured Achilles can last anywhere from four to six months before most patients \"return to their former level of activity.\" However, \"some problems can persist for up to a year\" without more exercises to rebuild strength and stability.\n\nHow long Kittle remains out will depend on the severity of his Achilles rupture and the length of his rehab process. The timeline for his return may become clearer once Kittle is out of surgery and has started his rehab.\n\nGEORGE KITTLE INJURY: Is it the 'last straw' for 49ers? Why one star foresees opposite effect\n\nKittle played in just 11 games this season in another year tainted by injuries. A Grade 3 hamstring tear kept him out of five games early in the season, and an ankle sprain later in the season caused Kittle to miss another game.\n\nHere's Kittle's numbers from a 2025 season that featured fewer games played for the tight end than any season since 2020:\n\nDespite the relative lack of playing time in 2025, Kittle's seven touchdowns were the third-highest total of his career behind 11 (2022) and eight (2024). The 49ers' tight end also earned a fifth straight Pro Bowl nod in 2025 and seventh in the last eight years.\n\nGeorge Kittle (season-ending IR – Achilles)\n\nTonges, who had his first career reception with a touchdown in Week 1 this year, is a fourth-year tight end who has taken on the primary tight end role in Kittle's absences this year. His 46 targets during the regular season were the most of any 49ers pass-catchers outside of Kittle, running back Christian McCaffrey and San Francisco's three leading wide receivers.\n\nFarrell joined the 49ers as a free agent last offseason after four years in Jacksonville and recorded his first career receiving touchdown in Week 2. Willis was on the 49ers' practice squad for most of the season and re-signed to the team's active roster after Kittle's Achilles injury.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: George Kittle injury update: When will 49ers TE return?",

    "fullText": "The San Jose Sharks have been a nice surprise this season. At the time of this writing, they have a 24-20-3 record and have the second wild card spot in the Western Conference.\n\nWith the Sharks being right in the playoff race, it would be understandable if they considered adding to their roster by the deadline. This is especially so if a potential target would benefit them beyond this season.\n\nWhen looking at trade candidates around the NHL, one player who could make sense for the Sharks to take a chance on is Edmonton Oilers forward Andrew Mangiapane.\n\nThere is a real expectation that the Oilers will end up trading Mangiapane this season. The 29-year-old forward has struggled to find his fit in Edmonton, and he is reportedly willing to waive his no-movement clause for the right team.\n\nMangiapane has struggled this season, as evidenced by his five goals and 11 points in 42 games. Yet, when looking at his past success, there is reason to believe that he could bounce back in the right situation. From 2021-22 to 2023-24 with the Calgary Flames, Mangiapane recorded at least 40 points in each campaign. With this, he could be an intriguing player for the Sharks to buy low on.\n\nIf Mangiapane bounced back, he would have the potential to be a nice pickup for the Sharks' top nine and would also give them another option for their power play. He also has a $3.6 million cap hit until next season, so he would be more than a rental.",

    "fullText": "Atletico Madrid will be busy between now and the closing of the winter transfer window, as they seek reinforcements for Diego Simeone’s squad. The departures of Javi Galan, Conor Gallagher and Giacomo Raspadori mean that a new left, central midfielder and forward are needed, and currently, work is being done on each area.\n\nMidfield is the priority for the time being, but addressing defence and attack is equally important. For the latter, targets have already been identified, with the favourite having also been picked out.\n\nAs per Diario AS, Atleti are very keen on signing Lee Kang-in, and talks between the two clubs are already ongoing. Director of Football Mateu Alemany has been in Paris in recent days, and he took in Paris Saint-Germain’s 3-0 victory over Lille on Friday, a match that the South Korea international was not involved in.\n\nLee is currently sidelined with a minor injury, but he will be back in action before the end of the month. Atleti do not see his current absence as a stumbling block, which is they have made their move, and with good relations between themselves and PSG, it is hoped that an agreement can be reached in the coming days.\n\nPSG are counting on Lee, so it is far from certain that PSG will allow a deal to be done. If that is the case, Atleti are prepared to move for another Ligue 1 attack: Matias Fernandez-Pardo. As per Diario AS, Los Colchoneros have rekindled the interest they showed in the summer, with the feeling now being that a deal is much more achievable.\n\nIt will be interesting to see who Atleti end up with, but both players would be exciting additions to Simeone’s squad – certainly more so than Raspadori was in the summer.",

Bailey Barnhard scored all 6 of her points in overtime, while Martinez got open back-door to give the Aztecs a two-possession lead midway through the extra session.\n\nThe Aztecs came out of halftime hitting almost everything from beyond the arc, as Martinez opened the third quarter by nailing back to back triples. UNLV responded with an 8-0 run that put the hosts back in front, but Panganiban kept the offense rolling by starting SDSU’s biggest scoring run of regulation.\n\nFirst she canned a 3-pointer, then Martinez got free for a driving layup as Alyssa Jackson and Panganiban made back-to-back 3’s as part of an 11-0 run and 17-8 push to start the second half. The lead grew as large as 10 points twice in the fourth quarter on a Martinez driving score and a Panganiban jumper.\n\nBut UNLV, who have won the last four regular season Mountain West titles, put together a 10-0 run over a 1:42 stretch to retake the lead with 41 seconds remaining. Mariah Elohim made two of her three 3-pointers for the game during the stretch, with Lady Rebels leading scorer kicking the run off with her 16th of 18 points of the night on a transition layup.\n\nPanganiban nailed a triple with 41 seconds left to put SDSU back in front by 1, but the Aztecs fouled Jasmyn Lott on a fast break with 18 seconds remaining, but the guard split the pair at the free-throw line. SDSU had a chance to win the game in regulation when Kennedy Lee was fouled on a put back attempt after Nala Williams’ driving attempt missed.\n\nThe win extended the Aztecs streak to 10 in a row, and was the first win in a true road game at UNLV since the 2012-13 season. San Diego State is 5-0 on the road this season and are 15-4 on the road since the beginning of last year.\n\nUp next will have a bye during the midweek round of Mountain West games, returning to action against the San José State Spartans on Saturday, Jan. 24. Tip-off is scheduled for 1 p.m. and the game will be streamed on the Mountain West Network.",

    "fullText": "All signs are Sam Darnold will start the Seahawks’ first playoff game.\n\nQuestionable to play because of an oblique injury he felt in practice Thursday, the Pro Bowl quarterback was on the field throwing as usual in full pads for pregame warmups about 45 minutes before the Seahawks hosted the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC divisional playoffs at Lumen Field Saturday night.\n\nDarnold threw a couple initial passes. He then windmilled his arms to loosen up before resuming his normal pregame routine. Darnold increased his throws to 25 yards, not throwing particularly hard and more lofting his passes.\n\nWhen the team went to 11 on 11 drills, Darnold was running the starting offense, as usual. He threw passes to Jason Smith-Njigba and other starters. He wasn’t throwing all that hard, because he didn’t have to yet, still a half hour before kickoff.\n\nDarnold had not been on the field during early pregame warmups about an hour earlier. Drew Lock threw to Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Cooper Kupp, AJ Barner and Seattle’s starting receivers. Rookie Jalen Milroe threw to reserves.\n\nThen the team issued their inactive players 90 minutes before kickoff, per NFL rules. Darnold was active to play. Milroe was inactive and the emergency third quarterback, as usual.\n\nDarnold and Lock being the team’s active quarterbacks was a sign the Seahawks were either waiting closer to kickoff to test Darnold’s oblique injury which had him questionable to play, or that he’d already tested it and they’d made their determination. “It’s just something he’s never experienced before,” Seahawks general manager John Schneider said on the team’s radio pregame show.\n\n“I think it’s just more precautionary stuff going on.\n\n“Luckily our medical staff (experienced) with it. And we move on.”",

    "description": "Sumayah Sugapong and Achol Magot had big games for the Wildcats",
    "fullText": "As the Arizona women’s basketball team prepared to go on the road and face No. 10 TCU, head coach Becky Burke said that the Wildcats weren’t going to Fort Worth with the idea that they were already beaten. That was despite losing leading scorer Micky Perdue just over a week ago.\n\n“What an opportunity for some other people to step up, what an opportunity for us to go get a couple wins…when there’s not one person outside this building that thinks that’s gonna happen,” Burke said on Wednesday.\n\nThe Wildcats showed that mindset from the jump, forcing TCU into 8 turnovers in the first quarter and turning those into 9 points. They didn’t back down, and after 20 minutes they were up 30-28 and had become the first opponent to lead at the half in Schollmaier Arena since Feb. 23, 2024. TCU picked it up over the final 15 minutes of the game to survive with a 78-62 victory.\n\n“We can go…and say we threw some punches because we gave it our all,” Burke said. “We fought, we battled, we followed a game plan to perfection that I think was really, really effective. TCU is a great team, well coached. We respected them at the highest level coming into this game, but we didn’t come in here like we were planning on losing, and I was really proud of our team’s effort for that, in our fight, in the situation that we’re in this year, and with losing our leading scorer…There’s a lot of things that our team could be down and out about, and they are not and they’re fighting and they’re battling, and just probably as proud as I’ve sat at a podium despite a loss.”\n\nSumayah Sugapong led the way, scoring 11 points in the first quarter. She ended the game with 17 points, 4 rebounds, 4 assists, 1 block, and 3 steals. She was also one of two Arizona players called for technical fouls after making big plays. Those led to four TCU points.\n\n“In a game like this, where we’re sort of the underdog, I think that’s where a lot of us thrive, just coming in competing,” Sugapong said. “I was talking about, really no pressure on us coming into this game. So just going out there, playing hard, and sometimes emotions take over a little bit too much.”\n\nGoing into the week, Burke said that this game would be a prime opportunity for Achol Magot. The 6-foot-7 center would be needed against the 6-foot-7 pair of Clara Silva and Kennedy Basham. It worked. Basham fouled out in eight minutes without scoring.\n\nMagot made her biggest impact in the third quarter. She had six points and three rebounds while drawing several fouls on Silva and Basham. She ended the game with 12 points, 7 rebounds, and 1 assist. She hit 4 of her 8 shots and went 4 for 5 from the free throw line. Most importantly, she had just 3 fouls in 16 minutes of play and was even diving to the floor to get to 50-50 balls.\n\n“Achol had an interesting week, but she was ready when her number was called,” Burkes said. “And I’m just going to continue to challenge Achol to practice hard, to play hard, to be ready for opportunities. Because, you know, she looks a little bit different than anybody else on our team. She looks like the opposing post players, and from a size, physicality standpoint, we do need her presence. This is by far her best game. She was able to play 16 minutes. We haven’t gotten that out of her. She was able to get out there and contribute in a way that she hasn’t so far this season, and we’re going to need that in the second half of Big 12 play. So excited for her to gain that confidence today and build off of it.”\n\nIt wasn’t enough, though. TCU started to pull away halfway through the third quarter. The Horned Frogs were up by eight with 3:37 left in the frame and had a seven-point lead after 30 minutes.\n\nThey kept that momentum in the fourth. Arizona didn’t score over the first 3.5 minutes of the final quarter while TCU hit one after another. The lead hit double digits with 8:49 left in the game and was up to 18 by the time Arizona scored.\n\nLani Cornfield was the third Wildcat with double-figure scoring. She ended with 11 points, 4 rebounds, 5 assists, and 1 block. The block was followed by what the official deemed was an unsportsmanlike stare down, and she picked up Arizona’s second technical foul of the day. It was her fifth foul.\n\nBlessing ‘Adde’ Adebanjo also fouled out for Arizona, but she made an impact before doing so. She scored 9 points on 4-of-5 shooting, grabbed 1 rebound, dished out 1 assist, and had 1 steal in 15 minutes on the court.\n\nArizona will return home to face Kansas on Tuesday, Jan. 20 at 6 p.m. MST. The Wildcats will try to grab their second Big 12 win after losing their last home game to UCF just 24 hours after learning Perdue would not play. They now stand at 10-7 and 1-5 in conference play.\n\nTCU improved to 18-1 and 6-1 in Big 12 play. They earned a share of the Big 12 lead after Kansas State upset No. 17 Texas Tech in Lubbock earlier in the day.",

    "fullText": "Augsburg striker Michael Gregoritsch has commented on what it felt like to return to the Bundesliga so much sooner than expected with one of his old clubs. The Austrian international unfortunately didn’t make much of a mark in Thursday night’s 1-1 draw with Union Berlin beyond accidentally colliding with FCU captain Rani Khedira early. It was nevertheless an emotional occasion for the 31-year-old.\n\n“I felt so sorry,” Gregoritsch remarked in the WWK Arena mixed zone. “I really wanted to avoid him, but he ran into me. I thought he was blocking me, but then he suddenly turned away. Rani is one of my closest friends in football. You can see that I apologized immediately. It was also uncomfortable for me because I didn’t mean to do it. I apologized throughout the entire game and promised Rani our next meal is on me.“\n\nWith his new club fighting relegation, Gregoritsch wished to make clear that he knew precisely what was expected of him. Despite the fact that both he and the Fuggerstädter haven’t gotten off to very good start in 2026 (a bad loss against Borussia Mönchengladbach and the points dropped against Union), Gregoritsch emphasized that he felt things would trend upward.\n\n“I really missed the Bundesliga and am so happy to be back here,” Gregoritsch said. “[coming back from Denmark] I’ve had a longer winter break and not much training rime. One can see that the team is a little unsettled, but they are basically good guys with a lot of quality. As one of the old guys, it’s my job to help. We’re getting better and I’m optimistic.”\n\nFCA head coach Manuel Baum appeared to suggest so at his Friday pre-match press conference. Even though the Thursday Bundesliga fixture leaves the team on a tight turnaround, Baum stressed that he wanted to build a consistent squad.\n\n“There may be some changes, but I’m less in favor of rotating because I believe we need a core,” Baum said. “There are a few here with a Freiburg past. With regard to ‘Gregerl,’ I asked him today and he said he feels really good. So it’s possible that he’ll start again.“",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThis season is the best for the Chicago Bears in quite some time, as they finished the regular season 11-6, winning the NFC North, and have the chance to reach the NFC championship game if they can defeat the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday night.\n\nMany people have stated the reasons they believe the Bears have had a franchise-altering season, such as the hiring of head coach Ben Johnson and the rise of second-year quarterback Caleb Williams. Both have, without a doubt, had a significant positive impact on the team.\n\nHowever, Johnson gave an unlikely reason for the team's success this season: a player who has been in the league for a long time.\n\nMore: Bears' Colston Loveland is 2nd in NFL history with crazy stats, joining Gronk with this record\n\nVeteran backup quarterback Case Keenum received high praise from his head coach for the role he has played this season for Chicago, despite not taking any snaps with the team.\n\n\"He's been tremendous in terms of Caleb's growth. That was really the thought process of bringing him in, a guy with skins on the wall. He's played in big games himself at a high level. He's won big games. He's lost big games. His experience has really been something that all these young players can really lean into,\" Johnson said to the media on Friday.\n\nJohnson makes a great point as Keenum has seen it all in his 13 seasons in the league and has been a servicable backup for most of his years, so even though it doesn't sound ideal, it shouldn't be as surprising that this young Bears team has leaned on the veteran.\n\nKeenum's leadership will be needed for at least one game against one of his former teams, the Rams, which is set to be the team's most formidable opponent yet.\n\nCaleb Williams fires back at Packers’ super fan Lil Wayne after wild tweet\n\nChicago Bears now know who they will face in divisional round of playoffs\n\nBears, Bills, Rams set an NFL playoff record already with crazy comeback history\n\nCaleb Williams planted an image in Packers fans' heads that will haunt them all offseason\n\nCaleb Williams gets emotional paying tribute to Ben Johnson after Bears' playoff win",

    "fullText": "DETROIT -- Isaiah Jackson knew as soon as he took an elbow from Boston center Neemias Queta on Dec. 22 that he had a problem and that it was probably a concussion.\n\nJackson said he also took a hit to the head in a previous game that might have been a concussion but wasn't sure. But Queta hit him hard twice with elbows, and by the time he got to the locker room in Boston, he knew for sure he had one and he wasn't going to be playing for awhile.\n\n\"I knew then that I had one and that I should just chill,\" Jackson said. \"When it happened I went back to the locker room and I was throwing up and stuff and my head was hurting. The next day, it just kept getting worse and worse and worse. It was a process. I didn't know it was going to be as severe as it was. I thought it was going to be a one- or two-day thing and then I'd be good. But it took a long time.\"\n\nIt was well into the new year before Jackson was cleared to return to basketball activities and after about a week of conditioning he was cleared to play in Saturday's game against the Pistons near his home town of Pontiac, Mich. Jackson said he experienced just about every symptom one could expect while dealing with a concussion.\n\n\"Headaches,\" Jackson said. \"Fogginess. My thoughts were foggy. ...

I’m in a great situation with Ohio State. I know where I want to go.”\n\nBig Walnut High School serves students from the surrounding areas in Sunbury, Ohio. The school is known for its commitment to academic excellence and comprehensive extracurricular programs, including a robust athletics program.

He also caught five touchdowns. That came after a breakout junior campaign, in which he tallied over 1,800 yards on the ground and 27 more scores. Across three seasons, Smith tallied over 5,700 total yards and 74 touchdowns.\n\nThe departure of Smith leaves head coach Brent Brennan and Co. with four four-star signees in their 2026 class: Downey (Calif.) four-star quarterback Oscar Rios, Gilbert (Ariz.) Williams Field four-star interior offensive lineman Malachi Joyner, El Paso (Texas) Franklin four-star IOL Justin Morales and Pittsburg (Calif.) four-star wide receiver RJ Mosley.\n\nBefore Smith’s decommitment, the Arizona class ranked No. 42 in the Rivals Industry Team Recruiting Rankings.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhere to watch Bills vs. Broncos\n\nAfter their first-round bye and securing the No. 1 seed in the conference, the Denver Broncos will host the No. 6 seed Buffalo Bills and quarterback Josh Allen.\n\nAllen, who willed his team to a wild-card victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars, now sets his sights on returning to the game he has struggled to win in previous years. This time, the key difference is the absence of Patrick Mahomes and the three-time AFC champion Chiefs.\n\nThe Broncos, after going 14-3 in the regular season, are the top contenders in the AFC, in large part due to their defense. They will rely on this unit to limit Allen and company, with Mile High making it even more challenging for them to operate their offense.\n\nThe Sporting News is tracking live scores, updates, and highlights as the Broncos host the Bills in the Divisional Round.

The Broncos' defense will need to step up to prevent the Bills from adding to their lead.\n\n6:57 p.m. TOUCHDOWN: Allen delivers a dime to his TE to take their first lead since the 1st quarter. The Bills erase a 13-point deficit, and now the pressure falls right back on the Broncos and Nix.\n\nDALTON KINCAID WHAT A CATCH TO TIE IT\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/y4wUrQgjb5\n\n6:56 p.m.: Allen is able to connect with Khalil Shakir for a 46-yard completion.

However, Buffalo has two fumbles that the Broncos not only recovered, but scored points off.\n\nThe Broncos could not have had a better end to the first half, scoring 10 points in 22 seconds.

Humphrey dropped a touchdown in the first quarter, but made up for it\n\n5:53 p.m.: The Broncos will be without Pat Bryant after leaving the game with three catches on the game's opening drive.\n\nTroy Franklin is also questionable to return with a hamstring injury.

    "fullText": "Editor's note: See live coverage of the Buffalo Bills vs. Denver Broncos AFC divisional playoff game here, and return to USA TODAY \n\nThe NFL playoff bracket began with 14 teams and five weeks to determine this year's champion at Super Bowl 60 in Santa Clara in February. There was always a chance that not every postseason game would be decided in four quarters.\n\nThe divisional round is providing NFL fans with their first look at overtime in the 2025 postseason. The Buffalo Bills forced OT against the Denver Broncos with a late field goal by Matt Prater.\n\nThis marks the sixth overtime playoff game in the last six seasons.\n\nHere's what to know about the overtime rules in the NFL playoffs:\n\nIf the score is tied after regulation, there's another coin toss. Here's what the rules are:\n\nThe overtime period is 15 minutes long.\n\nIt is 10 minutes in the regular season.\n\nEach team gets three timeouts per half (two overtime periods).\n\nEach team will have a possession, but the game does not automatically end if the first team scores a touchdown.\n\nIf the score is still tied after each team gets one possession, the next score wins.\n\nAn exception is made if the team that first possesses the ball commits a safety. The kickoff team wins in this scenario, the same as in the regular season.\n\nExtra points are not attempted if the game ends in a touchdown.\n\nAll replays are initiated by the replay official and not by the coach's challenge.\n\nWild card round: Saturday, Jan. 10 to Monday, Jan. 12, 2026\n\nDivisional round: Saturday, Jan. 17 to Sunday, Jan. 18, 2026\n\nConference championship: Sunday, Jan. 25, 2026\n\nSuper Bowl: Sunday, Feb. 8, 2026\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: NFL overtime rules: What are OT rules in playoffs?",

    "fullText": "Oregon will likely be without point guard Jackson Shelstad for the rest of the season.\n\nCoach Dana Altman said after the Ducks lost 81-71 to Michigan on Jan. 17 — the fourth straight missed game for Shelstad — that tests taken on Friday revealed tendon and ligament damage in his right hand and it may require surgery, the recovery time for which is six to eight weeks.\n\n\"If he has to have surgery, it'll be the season,\" Altman said. \"So, I'm sure that we won't have him the rest of the year. There will be a decision made next week on surgery ... but there's just some tendon and ligament damage, it looks like, that hasn't healed.\"\n\nShelstad injured his hand against Omaha on Dec. 28 and has been sitting out ever since.\n\nThe three-year starter and an all-Big-Ten Conference preseason selection, is second on the team in scoring at 15.6 points per game and leads the Ducks in assists (59) and steals (17).\n\nHe missed the first game of the season as he recovered from surgery after breaking his right hand in a preseason practice. Altman reiterated Saturday that Shelstad's current injury is not related to his injury or surgery from last fall.\n\nOregon was also without starting center Nate Bittle against Michigan. The Ducks' leading scorer was on the bench with a boot on his left foot. Bittle used a scooter to move around without putting pressure on what Altman labeled a \"lower leg\" injury that Bittle suffered Tuesday at Nebraska.\n\nForward Sean Stewart said the team recently held a players-only meeting to address the loss of their top two players and how to move forward.\n\n\"We basically said, everybody's just got to come together, next man up,\" Stewart said. \"Nobody plays less hard against us because Nate and Jackson are out, so we just have to play harder than ever.\"\n\nChris Hansen covers University of Oregon football, men’s basketball, track and field, cross country and softball for The Register-Guard.

    "fullText": "Irrespective of your programming language of choice, calling C functions is often a necessity. For the longest time, the only standard way to call C was the Java Native Interface (JNI). But it was so painful that few dared to do it. I have heard it said that it was deliberately painful so that people would be enticed to use pure Java as much as possible.\n\nSince Java 22, there is a new approach called the Foreign Function & Memory API in java.lang.foreign. Let me go through step by step.\n\nYou need a Linker and a SymbolLookup instance from which you will build a MethodHandle that will capture the native function you want to call.\n\nTo load the SymbolLookup instance for your library (called mylibrary), you may do so as follows:\n\nThe native library file should be on your java.library.path path, or somewhere on the default library paths. (You can pass it to your java executable as -Djava.library.path=something).\n\nAlternatively, you can use SymbolLookup.libraryLookup or other means of loading\n\nthe library, but System.loadLibrary should work well enough.\n\nYou have the lookup, you can grab the address of a function like so:\n\nThis returns an Optional<MemorySegment>. You can grab the MemorySegment like so:\n\nOnce you have your MemorySegment, you can pass it to your linker to get a MethodHandle which is close to a callable function:\n\nThe functiondescr must describe the returned value and the function parameters that your function takes.\n\nIf you pass a pointer and get back a long value, you might proceed as follows:\n\nThat is, the first parameter is the returned value.\n\nFor function returning nothing, you use FunctionDescriptor.ofVoid.\n\nThe MethodHandle can be called almost like a normal Java function:\n\nmyfunc.invokeExact(parameters). It always returns an Object which means that if it should return a long, it will return a Long. So a cast might be necessary.\n\nYou can allocate C data structures from Java that you can pass to your native code by using an Arena. Let us say that you want to create an instance like\n\nYou could do it in this manner:\n\nYou can then pass myseg as a pointer to a data structure in C.\n\nYou often get an array with a try clause like so:\n\nThere are many types of arenas: confined, global, automatic, shared. The confined arenas are accessible from a single thread. A shared or global arena is accessible from several threads. The global and automatic arenas are managed by the Java garbage collector whereas the confined and shared arenas are managed explicitly, with a specific lifetime.\n\nSo, it is fairly complicated but manageable. Is it fast? To find out, I call from Java a C library I wrote with support for binary fuse filters. They are a fast alternative to Bloom filters.\n\nYou don’t need to know what any of this means, however. Keep in mind that I wrote a Java library called jfusebin which calls a C library. Then I also have a pure Java implementation and I can compare the speed.\n\nI should first point out that even if calling the C function did not include any overhead, it might still be slower because the Java compiler is unlikely to inline a native function. However, if you have a pure Java function, and it is relatively small, it can get inlined and you get all sorts of nice optimizations like constant folding and so forth.\n\nThus I can overestimate the cost of the overhead. But that’s ok. I just want a ballpark measure.\n\nIn my benchmark, I check for the presence of a key in a set. I have one million keys in the filter. I can ask whether a key is not present in the filter.\n\nI find that the library calling C can issue 44 million calls per second using the 8-bit binary fuse filter. I reach about 400 million calls per second using the pure Java implementation.\n\nThus I measure an overhead of about 20 ns per C function calls from Java using a macBook (M4 processor).\n\nObviously, in my case, because the Java library is so fast, the 20 ns becomes too much. But it is otherwise a reasonable overhead.\n\nDaniel Lemire, \"A new way to call C from Java: how fast is it?,\" in Daniel Lemire's blog, January 17, 2026, https://lemire.me/blog/2026/01/17/a-new-way-to-call-c-from-java-how-fast-is-it/.\r\n [BibTeX]",

    "title": "You Need More AWS Accounts Than You Think",
    "description": "Your lead engineer thinks 10 AWS accounts is overkill. Here's why starting clean is weeks of work, while untangling later is 6-12 months of migration pain.",
    "fullText": "\"We don't need 10+ AWS accounts. It's overkill for us—we can do this later after we launch. This will slow down product development and add unnecessary complexity.\"\n\nI've heard this pushback dozens of times. And here's the thing: the instincts behind it aren't wrong.\n\nIt can feel like over-investing in infrastructure too early. It is more accounts than most people new to AWS start with. And if you've used multi-account setups before without good tooling, they absolutely can feel cumbersome and slow.\n\nOn top of that, understanding someone else's infrastructure code is always harder than code you wrote yourself, and you don't even know the final product architecture yet—shipping the product has to be the priority.\n\nThe counterproposal usually sounds reasonable:\n\n\"We just need dev, staging, and production accounts. Anything more is unnecessary complexity.\"\n\nHere's the thing: this is correct. To operate any product on AWS, you need a minimum of one account per SDLC stage—dev, staging, production. That's the baseline.\n\nThe misunderstanding comes when you look at this holistically: what does the organization need to operate securely? There's more than your software at stake.\n\nThe \"three accounts\" view only considers the application. It ignores everything else the organization needs to function—and that's where it breaks down the moment you start asking concrete questions.\n\nIf they're centralized—and they should be for security, compliance, and tamper resistance—they can't live in dev/staging/prod. Hence an audit account.\n\nWhere does your container registry live?\n\nIf you rebuild container images per account, you're triplicating images and not running what you tested. If you promote artifacts—which you should—a shared account is the logical solution. Hence an artifacts account.\n\nIn every account? That's 3× the cost and operational overhead. If centralized, how do they securely talk to services across accounts? Hence an automation account and a transit gateway. Don't think you need self-hosted runners? Make sure you have other ways to manage Kubernetes and RDS databases on private subnets.\n\nNone of these are future-state problems—they show up fast.\n\nWhen you put it all together—answering each of those concrete questions—you end up with:\n\nThat's 9–10 accounts for a minimal level of isolation.\n\nNot because someone decided \"9–10 is the right number.\" Because each account answers a specific question that you'll have to answer anyway. The accounts aren't arbitrary—they're the natural result of thinking through where things actually need to live.\n\nDoes this seem like a lot? Consider what happens without these boundaries:\n\nThe accounts aren't bureaucracy. They're guardrails that let you move faster, not slower.\n\nHere's the thing: you can add accounts later. That's not the myth.\n\nThe myth is believing it's easy or cheap to do later. It's not.\n\nAdding accounts later requires complex migrations, scheduling and coordination across teams, and untangling months or years of decisions built on faulty assumptions—like CIDR allocations that don't support peering or future growth.\n\nSome accounts are genuinely optional. If you're never going to have self-hosted runners, skip the automation account. If you're never using AWS as a DNS registrar, skip the DNS account. No big deal.\n\nBut some decisions are foundational—and brutal to change later:\n\nThe accounts themselves might sit empty for a while. But the architectural decisions you make on day one—CIDR allocation strategy, naming conventions, network topology—those get baked in immediately.\n\nHere's the real message: unless you operate today like you'll have multiple accounts, adding more accounts later won't make a difference.\n\nYou need to instill multi-account practices now in how you architect your applications and base your assumptions. It affects everything: network CIDR allocations, naming conventions, S3 bucket naming, Terraform state storage, DNS architecture, IAM trust relationships.\n\nCreate the boundaries now. Use them as the problems present themselves. If you wait until you need them, you're not just creating accounts—you're untangling everything you built assuming they didn't exist.\n\nThere's another reason account boundaries matter that's easy to underestimate:\n\nVPCs only give you network isolation. Accounts are the only hard IAM boundary AWS gives you.\n\nIf your goal is developer autonomy—letting engineers move fast without stepping on each other—fewer accounts actually makes that harder, not easier.\n\nYou end up either doing fragile IAM gymnastics, or giving everyone administrative access—which is very hard to walk back. Clean account boundaries let devs have broad access in some places and almost none in others—especially around production and security.\n\nAnd here's the uncomfortable truth: nothing is harder to craft than IAM policies.\n\nGetting IAM right in a single-account setup where you need to simulate multi-account boundaries is exponentially more complex than just having the boundaries in the first place.\n\nThis might look like over-engineering. It's not—it's choosing where to pay the cost.\n\nHere's the key: it's only complicated if you don't have the right tooling, conventions, and a framework that ties it together.\n\nWith the right tooling (like Atmos), managing 10 accounts isn't harder than managing 3. The complexity objection assumes you're doing this manually or piecing it together yourself. A proper framework handles the multi-account orchestration for you.\n\nSimple account setups optimize for getting started. Multi-account setups optimize for not having to unlearn assumptions later.\n\nYou're not adding complexity. You're preventing it.\n\nThe complexity of multi-team access, centralized logging, artifact promotion, and network segmentation is coming whether you plan for it or not. The only question is whether you have clean boundaries when it arrives, or whether you're retrofitting them into a single-account monolith.\n\nI genuinely understand the pushback. The instinct to ship fast and avoid premature complexity is exactly right in most contexts.\n\nBut AWS account boundaries aren't premature complexity—they're deferred simplicity. The complexity exists regardless. The only question is whether you've given it clean places to live.\n\nStarting clean is weeks. Untangling later is months.\n\nIf you're navigating this conversation internally and want help making the case—or just want to talk through the tradeoffs with someone who's been there—talk to an engineer. No sales theater. Just engineers who understand both the technical reality and the organizational dynamics at play.",

    "fullText": "Umarell (Italian spelling of the Bolognese Emilian word umarèl, Emilian pronunciation: [umaˈrɛːl]; plural umarî) are men of retirement age who spend their time watching construction sites, especially roadworks – stereotypically with hands clasped behind their back and offering unrequested advice to the workers.[1] Its literal meaning is \"little man\" (also umaréin).[2] The term is employed as lighthearted mockery or self-deprecation.\n\nThe modern term was popularised in 2005 by local writer Danilo Masotti[3][4] through three books and an associated blog.[5][6] The word was included in the Italian Zingarelli dictionary in 2021[7][8][9][10][11] and in 2024 was included by Language Council of Sweden in the annual list of new Swedish words – the Språkrådets nyordslista [sv].[12][13]\n\nIn 2015, the city of Riccione, approximately 130 kilometres (80 miles) southeast of Bologna, allocated an €11,000 budget to pay a wage to umarells to oversee worksites in the city – counting the number of trucks in and out to ensure materials were delivered/removed according to the receipts, and guarding against theft when the site was otherwise unattended.[14] The town of San Lazzaro di Savena, 6 km (3+1⁄2 mi) to the South-East of Bologna, awarded the \"Umarell of the year\" prize to a local resident, Franco Bonini.[15][16]\n\nIn 2016, the local cultural association called Succede solo a Bologna (\"It only happens in Bologna\") released the \"Umarèl card\" as a fundraiser for continued restoration of the San Petronio church.[17][18] Separately, a mobile app called Umarells was released that tracked the location of ongoing roadworks and construction sites.[19][20] The fast food restaurant chain Burger King also \"hired\" several umarells as part of a social media marketing campaign promoting its increased presence in the country.[21]\n\nIn July 2017, the Bologna city council's \"consultative commission for street naming\" approved the naming of a public square to the East of the city centre in the Cirenaica district Piazzetta degli Umarells in recognition of the local fame of the concept and the name – noting with conscious irony that the square was under construction at the time.[22][23][24][25]\n\nIn April 2018, the public square was inaugurated by city councillor Matteo Lepore, the district president Simone Borsari, the \"lord of the umarells\" Franco Bonini, the stand-up comedian Maurizio Pagliari (Dulio Pizzocchi), and the writer Danilo Masotti.[26] A year later the street-sign for the square was stolen.[27]\n\nIn April 2020, the comic magazine Topolino dedicated an episode to the umarell Gerindo Persichetti.[28] In December 2020 in Pescara, the real estate developer Sarra installed windows to allow Umarells to observe three construction sites.[29][30] Since 2019, an annual calendar has been sold in Bologna newsstands. In 2021, a board game La Giornata dell’Umarell (An Umarell's Day) was released.[31]\n\nHaving officially entered the Swedish language in 2024,[13] in October 2025 the municipality of Karlskoga formally inaugurated \"Umarell benches\" (sv: umarell-bänkar) for locals to monitor the construction of a local bathhouse.[32][33]",

    "description": "How Dropstone Horizon Mode decouples reasoning depth from context length to enable 24+ hour autonomous engineering workflows.",
    "fullText": "Today we are releasing a technical overview of Horizon Mode, a new distributed runtime architecture designed to solve the \"Linearity Barrier\" in autonomous software engineering.\n\nCurrent Foundation Models (FMs) excel at short-burst generation but suffer from stochastic degradation as reasoning chains extend. In internal benchmarks, we observed that while standard transformers maintain high fidelity for tasks under 1 hour, their probability of maintaining a valid state drops exponentially as workflows exceed 24 hours.\n\nHorizon Mode addresses this by shifting from a monolithic \"next-token\" prediction model to a Recursive Swarm Topology. By orchestrating thousands of ephemeral, specialized agents, we have successfully demonstrated the ability to maintain coherent engineering logic over extended time horizons with a 99% reduction in compute costs compared to homogeneous swarms.\n\nIn traditional \"Monolithic Contextualization,\" an agent’s intelligence is strictly bound by its sliding context window. As a complex engineering task progresses, intermediate reasoning steps fill the window, forcing the model to either compress (lose detail) or truncate (forget instructions). We refer to this phenomenon as Instruction Drift.\n\nFor mission-critical engineering, drift is unacceptable. A security patch written at Hour 20 must strictly adhere to the safety constraints defined at Hour 0.\n\nHorizon Mode moves beyond the single-agent paradigm. Instead of asking one model to \"think harder\" for longer, we virtualize the cognitive process into a distributed search tree.\n\nWe treat compute as a liquid asset. Horizon Mode utilizes a tiered topology to optimize the \"Intelligence-to-Cost\" ratio:\n\nThis ensures that expensive, deep reasoning is only applied to high-value logic paths, not trial-and-error loops.\n\nTo prevent context saturation, we developed the Dynamic Distillation & Deployment (D3) Engine. Unlike standard RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) which relies on semantic similarity, D3 utilizes a Quad-Partite Cognitive Topology.\n\nAs agency increases, so does the risk of Instrumental Convergence (e.g., an agent disabling a firewall to \"fix\" a connection error).\n\nHorizon Mode implements a \"Shared-Nothing\" architecture with a Flash-Gated Consensus Protocol. Agents cannot communicate via natural language. Instead, they emit Boolean signals.\n\nWhen a solution is proposed, the swarm freezes. A dedicated Adversarial Monitor verifies the code against a Hierarchical Verification Stack (CstackC_{stack}). Only solutions that pass Syntactic (L1L_1), Static (L2L_2), and Functional (L3L_3) analysis are committed to the ledger.\n\nWe evaluated Horizon Mode on the internal \"Deep-Sec\" benchmark, which tests an agent's ability to refactor a legacy codebase while maintaining strict security compliance.\n\nHorizon Mode represents a step toward High-Assurance AI. By decoupling reasoning from the limitations of a single context window, we are paving the way for agents that can act as reliable, long-term partners in complex engineering challenges.\n\nWe are currently releasing the Technical Report detailing the architecture and safety protocols.",

All of those countries have already been paying some form of tariff since Trump's Liberation Day levies went into effect in August 2025.\n\n\"This tariff will be due and payable until such time a deal is reached for the complete and total purchase,\" he said in a Truth Social post.\n\nTrump's threat comes as world leaders and CEOs gather in Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum. The president is expected to address the conference in person on Wednesday.\n\nTrump has had Greenland on his mind since his first term, but has ramped up the rhetoric since the US raid in Venezuela that netted Nicolás Maduro.\n\nThe president says US control of Greenland is a national security issue. The Arctic country sits at a strategic point between Russia and China. The US already has a military base, known as the Pituffik Space Base, on the island. Greenland is also a base of critical natural resources, including lithium, gold, iron ore, and oil.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider last week, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Trump administration was considering a range of options to pursue Greenland, including \"utilizing the US Military.\"\n\nTrump's new tariff threat comes as the Supreme Court reviews whether the president has the authority to impose broad, sweeping tariffs on whatever country he wants — and there's a chance it could rule against the president.",

There will also be a rally and march in downtown Minneapolis at 2 p.m. local time.\n\n\"We will gather with family, neighbors, and community to show Minnesota's moral heart and economic power,\" organizers said in a Facebook post.\n\nOrganizers listed several demands, including that ICE leave Minnesota and that federal funding for ICE be scrapped in the upcoming congressional budget.\n\nThe Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation told Business Insider that ICE's presence is disrupting residents' daily lives.\n\n\"Working people from across sectors — hospitality, healthcare, education, custodial, construction, public works — are being targeted,\" the group said in a statement.\n\nThousands of ICE officers have descended on Minnesota as part of Operation Metro Surge, launched on December 1.

You won't steal from Americans or break our laws and get away with it,\" she said.\n\nThe Trump administration has criticized cities like Minneapolis that have passed so-called \"sanctuary\" laws preventing city resources and police from supporting federal immigration agents.

This time, we didn't just want a change of scenery; we wanted a change of lifestyle.\n\nBut finding a house in the bustling city neighborhood of our dreams within our budget meant downsizing — drastically.\n\nMoving from our 3,300-square-foot home to a 2,300-square-foot bungalow with 1,200 square feet of actual living space (the rest being unfinished basement) wasn't easy. It meant swapping our large kitchen island for a small dining table. It meant no more master bath soaking tub, my refuge from life's stresses on more occasions than I could count. And it meant my kids giving up their separate rooms to share one.\n\nBut what we've gained in the quality and quantity of time spent together is worth every bit of lost square footage.\n\nOur bigger house in Texas required more upkeep, and we were more than happy to give that up for extra free time on the weekends. Now, we spend our time visiting attractions such as the Denver Zoo and the Denver Museum of Nature and Science. We're fostering our kids' curiosity, exploring new places together. Our everyday life feels more special and meaningful because these shared experiences amplify our family connection.\n\nWe're also getting out in nature more. Aside from weekend hiking and skiing adventures, our days revolve around outdoor living. We walk everywhere we can, including restaurants, parks, and even Trader Joe's, which is beneficial because driving to Trader Joe's means parking at Trader Joe's, and nobody enjoys that. Our moods are lighter, and our stresses are reduced.\n\nThe first time we walked to a restaurant instead of driving, it felt like we were on vacation. Our lives had always been car-dependent, but that's no longer the case. The kids laughed and raced each other down the sidewalk. We marvelled at the mature trees and brightly colored flowers lining 7th Avenue Parkway. There was no timeline or rushing, just the joy of being present. When we made our way home after an alfresco dinner at Postino, I asked my son if he liked walking to dinner. He asked simply, \"Can we do this every day?\"\n\nZach and I frequently sit on our front porch while our boys play with neighborhood kids, a first for us. Having houses so close together makes it easier to meet people and form real connections. We know almost every household on our block, and we regularly visit with our closest neighbors. We even enjoyed our first block party in August, which fell on my eldest's birthday, and according to him, it was his \"Best birthday ever!\"\n\nOur boys run between yards while we chat with new friends. They are experiencing a childhood closer to the one we grew up with. They're building confidence and finding their place, and that's translating to more smiles and fewer tantrums. Zach and I are finding our village, and parenthood feels less solitary.\n\nOn a recent trip back to Texas for Thanksgiving, I texted our next-door neighbor to let her know we'd be out of town. Without even asking, she offered to take in our mail. It may be a small gesture, but that sense of community is priceless to us.\n\nDownsizing has also allowed our kids to play more independently in an outdoor space that feels safe and protected. We have an unobstructed line of sight to the backyard, and no matter where my husband and I are in the house, we can hear them if they need us. The result has been hours of creative play, building campsites and outdoor kitchens, playing soccer and baseball, and having water balloon fights or Nerf battles.\n\nMost evenings, my kids are in the backyard playing games and getting dirty. When the weather is nice, they run around with their friends down the street. I would never have felt comfortable not knowing every move my kids were making before, but here, where everyone is watching out, and I can wave at my kids down the block to signal when it's time to come home, less space means more freedom.\n\nOur downsized life isn't always perfect. Despite all our decluttering efforts, we're still left with more stuff than we can accommodate. We also struggle with the lack of privacy, and at times, our smaller shared space feels more claustrophobic than cozy. However, downsizing for an urban lifestyle has given us the opportunity to live beyond our four walls, and that's worth more than any amount of space could ever be.",

    "description": "The president also ruled out the bank’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, as a possible pick for Fed chair.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump announced Saturday that he will be suing the investment banking company JPMorgan Chase within “the next two weeks” for allegedly “DEBANKING” him after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection.\n\nTrump has claimed that the investment bank closed or restricted his accounts following the riot, effectively cutting him off from longstanding banking relationships. He has framed the action as politically motivated retaliation, arguing banks acted under pressure from the Biden administration. Trump has increasingly folded this into a broader narrative of “debanking” conservatives.\n\nJPMorgan has denied closing accounts for political reasons.\n\nDuring the 2024 campaign, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon had been floated for Treasury secretary by the president, but their relationship has since soured. Trump in August went after Dimon’s bank, as well as Bank of America, accusing them of discriminating against him in recent years.\n\nEarlier in 2025, the Trump Organization sued Capital One, accusing the bank of improperly cutting off access to the business, which was founded by the president’s late father and was helmed by Trump himself before he entered politics, following the Capitol attack.\n\nThe president also took issue with a Wall Street Journal story, which reported that he offered the Federal Reserve chair position to Dimon. “A front page Article in The Fake News Wall Street Journal states, without any verification, that I offered Jamie Dimon, of JPMorgan Chase, the job of Fed Chairman. This statement is totally untrue, there was never such an offer,” Trump wrote in his Truth Social post.\n\n“Why wouldn’t The Wall Street Journal call me to ask whether or not such an offer was made? I would have very quickly told them, ‘NO,’ and that would have been the end of the story,” Trump added in the post. “Why would I give it to Jamie? No such offer was made there, or even thought of, either. The Wall Street Journal ought to do better ‘fact checking,’ or its already strained credibility will continue to DIVE.”\n\nTrump seemed to be pointing to a story from the Journal published Wednesday, which reported that Trump offered Dimon the role earlier last year. Dimon took that as a joke, according to the Journal, citing people briefed on the discussion.\n\nDimon, asked in an interview with Bloomberg published Thursday whether he’d take the role, said: \"Absolutely, positively no chance, no way, no how, for any reason.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly lashed out at Dimon, dismissing his warnings that the Justice Department’s criminal probe into Fed Chair Jerome Powell, for whom the bank CEO said he has “enormous respect,” could threaten central bank independence. Tensions escalated further as JPMorgan publicly opposed Trump’s proposal to cap credit-card interest rates, with bank executives warning the move would shrink credit and hurt consumers.\n\n\"It would be very bad for consumers, very bad for the economy,\" JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum told reporters on the bank’s earnings call last Tuesday.",

    "description": "Hundreds of anti-ICE protesters in Minneapolis chased off a small group of far-right activists who had vowed to march on a neighborhood where many",
    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Hundreds of anti-ICE protesters in Minneapolis chased off a small group of far-right activists who had vowed to march on a neighborhood where many immigrants live on Saturday, stoking tensions in a city on edge after the ​killing of Renee Good by a federal immigration agent 10 days ago.\n\nWaving signs and screaming chants that called for U.S. Immigration and Customs ‌Enforcement and Border Patrol agents to leave Minneapolis, the anti-ICE protesters gathered downtown near City Hall. Scores of them moved forward, forcing about 10 far-right demonstrators against the outside of the municipal ‌government center within minutes. Some in the crowd tossed water balloons that soaked the right-wing demonstrators as temperatures hit -4 degrees Fahrenheit (-20 Celsius) with the wind chill.\n\nPolice maintained their distance as the dueling protests played out. About an hour after the rallies began, the tiny contingent of right-wing activists quickly walked a few blocks away to a hotel, hounded by hundreds of anti-ICE protesters who screamed obscenities and told them to get out of the city. A few scuffles broke out, but Reuters ⁠did not observe any serious violence.\n\nONLINE INFLUENCER REPORTS STABBING ‌ATTEMPT\n\nJake Lang, an online right-wing influencer and one of more than 1,500 people pardoned by President Donald Trump after their criminal convictions related to the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, organized what he called an “anti-fraud” rally. At no point ‍could Lang's voice be heard by the crowd.\n\nLater, Lang posted on X that he was stabbed during a scuffle but that his protective vest blocked the attempt. Reuters could not verify his account.\n\nMinneapolis police said in an email to Reuters they were aware of Lang's social media post, but no official report had been filed with the department. ​Police had received no reports of injuries related to the protests from victims.\n\nCamera feeds showed some people who appeared to be injured, police said, but ‌those individuals left before officers could contact them.\n\nThe anti-ICE protest was organized by the People’s Action Coalition Against Trump.\n\nTrump has repeatedly invoked a scandal around the theft of federal funds intended for social-welfare programs in Minnesota as a rationale for sending thousands of immigration enforcement agents into Minnesota. The president and administration officials have repeatedly singled out the state's community of Somali immigrants.\n\n\"We're here to support our Somali neighbors; they asked for their white allies to show up for them,\" said Laura, 56, who, like all protesters interviewed, asked that their last name not be used for fear of retribution by the federal government. \"I'm here ⁠to exercise my First Amendment right because my neighbors can't, they're too afraid to ​leave their house.\"\n\nLang, who has made anti-Muslim and antisemitic comments, has said he wants to secure ​the U.S. for white Christians. He has been present at small pro-ICE rallies in Minneapolis this week and has targeted Somali immigrants, most of whom are Muslim.\n\nSome 3,000 agents from ICE and Border Patrol have descended on Minneapolis and St. Paul in ‍recent weeks. An ICE agent fatally shot ⁠Good, a U.S. citizen and mother of three, after she drove away after being ordered by ICE agents to exit her vehicle. The officer who shot Good was positioned in front of her car on the left. DHS has said he was hit by the car and ⁠feared for his life, though videos show the agent remaining on his feet and raise questions about how much contact the car made with him.\n\nThe situation has set Minnesota’s Democratic leadership ‌at odds with Trump, whose Justice Department has opened an investigation into Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey.",

When I was leaving Wrexham the only place I was going was home.\n\n\"For a club of this stature, going almost 30 years without a league title is unacceptable so I've got a challenge and I love a challenge.\"",

Joris Seginds added the extras.\n\nIreland prop Tadhg Furlong came off injured and was replaced by Thomas Clarkson, while soon after Harry Byrne put Leinster's first points on the board with a penalty.\n\nBayonne restored their seven-point advantage when Segonds, the top points scorer in the Top 14, landed a kick from 45 metres after Leo Cullen's side infringed at a line-out.\n\nClarkson then scrambled over the line but the officials adjudged that there had been a double movement as he attempted to ground.\n\nFifteen minutes into the second half Leinster drew level with a converted try from Sheehan.\n\nPrendergast made a break and threw a wide pass to Jimmy O'Brien, who did well to ride a tackle before off-loading inside to the Ireland hooker, who produced a trademark burst of pace to scurry over.\n\nA second penalty of the match for Segonds restored Bayonne's lead and soon after O'Brien went over after getting on the end of Prendergast's grubber kick but replays showed that the full-back had spilled the ball as he went over the line.\n\nSegonds passed up the opportunity to extend the lead as his penalty sailed wide of the posts after Sheehan was penalised for collapsing the maul.\n\nWith six minutes remaining Leinster finally breached their opponents' defences again when Byrne chipped ahead and the ball bounced favourably for Prendergast, who dotted down between the posts.\n\nDeegan dived over in the corner in the final minute to increase the winning margin.\n\nBayonne: C Tiberghien; T Spring, S Maqala, M Tuilagi, Y Orabe; J Segonds, H Jantjies; I Calles, L Martin, J Tagi; E Johnson, L Paulos; A Fischer, A Iturria (capt), N Lomidze.\n\nReplacements: F Bosch, E Tumania, E Setiano, A Garcia Iandolino, B Heguy, M Ariceta, G Martocq, V Hannoun.\n\nLeinster: J O'Brien; T O'Brien; G Ringrose, R Henshaw; J Kenny; H Byrne, J Gibson-Park; J Boyle, R Kelleher, T Furlong; RG Snyman, J Ryan; M Deegan, J van der Flier, C Doris (capt).\n\nReplacements: D Sheehan, J Cahir, T Clarkson, J McCarthy, S Penny, L McGrath, S Prendergast, R Ioane.",

    "fullText": "Former Peterborough United and Hull City striker and Final Score pundit Aaron McLean gives his five takeaways from across the Championship, League One and League Two this weekend.\n\nChampionship leaders Coventry came back from 1-0 down to beat Leicester and end their three-game winless run, while fourth-placed Millwall defeated in-form Watford to stay in contention at the top.\n\nMcLean: \"The beginning of the season was incredible for Coventry but they have, by their own admission, hit a bit of a tough patch - so to get their first win in four league games will have done them the world of good.\n\n\"Frank Lampard will be feeling a lot brighter this evening. To come from behind and show the character they showed, and for Ellis Simms and Haji Wright to get back in the goals, I think everything is pointing back in the right direction.\n\n\"The most important thing after Middlesbrough won last night was to make sure they did their job and they did.\n\n\"Tuesday's game with in-form Millwall looks like it could be a great one for the neutral.\n\n\"I think what they have done so far has been absolutely incredible. I hope they can maintain it. They're not a team who will blow teams away but what they will do is grind points out.\n\n\"To go away to Watford, who on their day can beat anyone in this division and had been in fabulous form, and come away with the points and a clean sheet will show what they are about.\n\n\"They will be thinking this could be their season.\"\n\nSouthampton's poor form continued as they fell to a 2-1 home defeat by Hull City to stretch their run without a victory to seven matches.\n\nMcLean: \"The momentum for Southampton has dwindled away.\n\n\"They had that new manager bounce but over the past few weeks they have almost reverted to type and when they concede a goal it's that 'here we go again' syndrome and they can't seem to shake it..\n\n\"They desperately need a good win to get the feeling back.\n\n\"It feels like they will struggle to get anywhere near the play-offs.\n\n\"First of all they need to get some clean sheets. They're not keeping clean sheets and that is not giving them an opportunity to go and take something.\n\n\"If they can just go and grind out a couple of 1-0 wins then that will give them the confidence that they can go and be a bit more expansive.\n\n\"That is what the squad has been built in that mould but now they need to tighten up.\n\n\"At the moment it isn't working and they're getting punished.\"\n\nNew West Brom boss Eric Ramsay saw his side battle back from two goals down only to lose 3-2 at home to second-placed Middlesbrough on Friday. Norwich's 2-1 win at Wrexham on Saturday leaves them four points behind the Baggies before Tuesday's game between the two sides.\n\nMcLean: \"Going back to Friday night's game between West Brom and Middlesbrough, I feel like new boss Eric Ramsay has a huge job on his hands.\n\n\"They lost to an unbelievable strike in their last league game at Leicester and then they did so well to come back to 2-2 to Middlesbrough and then to lose so late on, I feel sorry for them.\n\n\"That has been their Achilles' heel though, they have conceded late goals time and time again.\n\n\"At this stage of the year you find yourselves in that position because your performances aren't good enough. Away from home their results have been abysmal and they find themselves in a lot of trouble.\n\n\"I look at Norwich, who they play on Tuesday in what looks like another great match, they have got that new manager bounce under Philippe Clement, and the Baggies need that now.\n\n\"It looks bleak but there is time to turn it around.\"\n\nLeague One leaders Cardiff City won 2-1 at third-placed Bradford City to strengthen their position at the top, while at the bottom, Doncaster claimed just a second league win since September with a 1-0 success at fellow strugglers AFC Wimbledon.\n\nMcLean: \"I look at Cardiff as the strongest team in that league and they will just be looking to keep Lincoln at arm's length.\n\n\"The Imps are the most in-form team in the division but let a two-goal lead slip to draw 2-2 at Luton today.\n\n\"I think if Cardiff finish above Lincoln then they will have won the league.\n\n\"I also like what Mansfield, who beat bottom side Port Vale 3-0 today, are doing. They've got momentum, they've got confidence and in Nigel Clough they've got a brilliant manager.\n\n\"They're winning games and getting a good level of consistency, if they can keep doing that then will put themselves in the play-off race.\n\n\"Down at the bottom of the league, it was a huge win for Doncaster against another team who have dropped off in AFC Wimbledon.\n\n\"The Dons shot themselves in the foot with a late red card and then conceding in the ninth minute of time added on. That is a hammer blow for Johnnie Jackson.\n\n\"For Doncaster it was a desperately needed win. When you go into a new year you are looking for that spark and that result today could give them that.\n\n\"It is the best way to win. There is no better feeling than a late win away from home. They need to bottle that and take it into the remaining games.\"\n\nIn League Two, Shrewsbury claimed a vital win against 10-man Harrogate to move four points clear of the bottom two.\n\nMcLean: \"Down at the bottom of League Two it was massive result for Shrewsbury.\n\n\"When you are down the wrong end of a division you have got to beat the teams around you.\n\n\"For Harrogate it's now 16 games without a win. Simon Weaver will be feeling the pressure and this will have been a game they'd have been looking at and thinking a result there today could have given them a major boost.\n\n\"The only team below them in the league Newport also took a really tough loss that I think just sums up their season.\n\n\"To concede in the 91st minute and the 99th minute, having taken the lead at Gillingham in the 84th minute... That shows boss Christian Fuchs the size of the job he has got.\n\n\"I think they're going to struggle to stay up but they're still within a shout because the teams above them aren't winning games either.\"\n\nAaron McLean was talking to BBC Sport England's Ian Woodcock.",

    "fullText": "Manchester City were outfought by rivals Manchester United on Saturday lunchtime in a derby defeat that not only gave their neighbours a winning start to a new era, but also dealt a further blow to the Citizens' title hopes.\n\nCity's demoralising 2-0 loss at a raucous Old Trafford allowed the home faithful to deservedly claim the bragging rights over their closest geographical rivals as they revelled in the perfect start to Michael Carrick's tenure as interim head coach.\n\nBut for the blue half of the city, defeat leaves them clinging to the title race by their fingertips, potentially falling nine points behind leaders Arsenal by the end of the day.\n\nThis was City's sixth game in 17 days and boss Pep Guardiola felt a lack of energy contributed to the defeat, rather than referee Anthony Taylor's decision to not send off United's Diogo Dalot in the first half.\n\n\"The better team won,\" said the Spaniard. \"They had something we didn't have. We always talk about the energy we need. It's related to how you defend, some moments, some duels and some situations, but also with the ball.\n\n\"It's my 27th derby. I came here many times and [today] we were not at the required level to win this type of game.\n\n\"We try. We talk about that but we had that energy four days ago at Newcastle. Even at Sunderland and the three games we draw we played extremely good in many departments but today, no.",

    "fullText": "NBA commissioner Adam Silver says he wants to \"tap into\" Europe's football culture as part of the plans for a proposed European basketball league.\n\nSilver says he has spoken to Manchester City and Manchester United, though BBC Sport understands neither intends to have a team should the venture come to fruition.\n\nWith a current working title of NBA Europe, the plan is to launch a permanent league across the continent that could start as soon as the 2027-28 season.\n\nAs many as 16 teams across the continent could be involved, with a team from both London and Manchester expected to feature.\n\nThe league is expected to be made up of new franchises, current basketball teams and football clubs who do and do not currently have associated basketball teams.\n\n\"We're having conversations with everyone, and it's part of why this process has gone on so long,\" Silver told BBC Sport.\n\n\"I began speaking publicly around the Paris Olympics, and we wanted to make sure we've covered everybody. We've talked to all interested parties, we're covering all areas and all opportunities.\"\n\nSilver also confirmed that he has spoken to Real Madrid, Barcelona and Paris St-Germain as he looks to mix established European teams with new ones.\n\nHowever, reports say the existing EuroLeague - which features Real and Barcelona - has concerns about the new venture, threatening legal action against the NBA should clubs break existing agreements to take part in the new competition.\n\nBut Silver, speaking before the NBA's first regular season match in London since 2019 on Sunday, feels the already existing strong support of football clubs could play a major role in growing the game across Europe.\n\n\"I want to be careful [of] those traditions,\" he said.\n\n\"That culture is so special, so unique, so long held, I don't want to fool myself or anybody else potentially involved in this new league that they can be easily transferred.\n\n\"At the same time, we want the benefits of that incredible wisdom and knowledge obtained over decades of operation.\n\n\"As an American, I see that religious fervour around people's football clubs here, and we could only be so lucky to tap into that. It's more singularly focused here. To me, that represents opportunity.\n\n\"We don't come into the market thinking we're going to take from football. What we see is a large opportunity and entertainment ecosystem, and we're seeing that all over the world that people are turning to premium live sports.\"",

    "fullText": "Thomas Frank's future may lie in the hands of those in power at Tottenham Hotspur, but the court of public opinion has delivered its damning final verdict.\n\nThe Dane has been the target for toxicity before as he fails dismally to win over Spurs supporters unconvinced by his pedigree after arriving from Brentford, along with a stodgy style regarded as conservative and dull.\n\nNot like this, though. Not on the levels of fury aimed at Frank at the dramatic conclusion of the 2-1 home defeat by struggling West Ham United.\n\nFrank looked a hapless, beaten figure as he offered polite applause to those who turned on him savagely after Callum Wilson bundled home a stoppage-time winner - the cue for a storm of discontent to be unleashed in his direction.\n\nSpurs fans were chanting \"sacked in the morning\" at their own manager even during the video assistant referee check for offside that eventually cleared Wilson's winner.\n\nSeconds later, when the final whistle confirmed the latest blow inflicted on Frank, it felt like there was no way back. This was the sound of a fanbase who had given up on their head coach, who no longer wanted him at the club.\n\nBrutal - but this was the inescapable conclusion. Frank was stunned, appearing broken as the pressure increasingly grows on his position.\n\nFormer Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney, told BBC Match of the Day: \"I felt for him - I have been in that position. It is a lonely position to be in. The Tottenham fans have spoken and, when that happens, it looks like he will lose his job.\"\n\nEx-England striker Alan Shearer, added: \"The players are not giving enough, there is no doubt but I don't see a plan or a system and some players are looking lost.\n\n\"When you look at some of their signings in the summer, I am thinking you have to give something extra. He knows the rules though, if you don't win games you are going to get sacked. He looked a very tired man by the end.\"",

You play these great champions like Judd and I am so proud because I've lost the last few against him.\"\n\nWith the momentum shifting, Higgins, 50, also took the fifth with a superb 104 break.\n\nThe Englishman pinched the sixth and eighth frames with half centuries after his opponent missed reds, but Higgins made a 57 clearance in similar fashion to take frame seven.\n\nTrump, 36, who has generally held sway in meetings between the pair since triumphing in their 2019 world final, looked set to seal victory in the ninth frame but with just four balls to pot, remarkably missed a routine brown.\n\nAnd that gave Higgins the impetus to craft pressure-breaks of 70 and 57 on his way to reeling off three tense frames in a row to complete a remarkable turnaround and become the oldest player to reach the final of a Triple Crown event.",

    "fullText": "Not for the first time this season, the full-time whistle at Anfield was met with boos from sections of the home support.\n\nFor the first time since the 1980-81 top-flight season, Liverpool had failed to win any of their three home league games against newly promoted sides.\n\nArne Slot's side drew 1-1 against Sunderland last month before drawing 0-0 against Leeds on New Year's Day. Saturday's 1-1 draw against Burnley completed the set.\n\nAsked about the boos, Slot said: \"In my head it wasn't booing but in my head it was frustration as well. If you, as Liverpool, are not disappointed by having a draw at home to Burnley then something is completely wrong.\n\n\"I completely understand the frustration. I have the same frustrations and the players definitely have the same frustrations as the fans.\"\n\nIn fairness, Slot's side did more than enough to win here against a Burnley side that scored from their only attempt on target.\n\nThe statistics alone told the story. Liverpool had 76 touches in the opposition box, 32 shots, 11 attempts on target and an xG of 2.95.\n\nOnly three times since records began have Liverpool taken more shots in a Premier League game without winning.\n\n\"I agree that we should have won this game,\" Slot told Match of the Day. \"There wasn't a lot more I could ask in terms of chance creation. We have a lot of ball possession but I would love us to create more.\n\n\"If we play a bit more open you always wonder if the other team can counter-attack you more, which you couldn't.
