But the Swedes still have a chance to grab bronze.",
    "fullText": "SYDNEY, N.S. — American forward Emily Pohl and blueliner Margaret Averill notched two goals and added two assists apiece to help lead the United States handily take the Swedes out of gold medal contention with a 9-1 win Saturday evening at the 2026 IIHF Under-18 Women's World Championship at Centre 200.\n\nForward Jane Daley was one of five other players to put one on the scoreboard for the U.S., making her record-setting 12th goal of this year's tournament, according to the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). She leads all players with 17 points total.\n\nAverill and Pohl opened it up in the first to make it 2-0 going into the first intermission, forwards Jillian McLaughlin and Daley added a couple \n\nThree of those first seven goals were scored on American powerplays, including one on a five-on-three in the second, which included a two-minute interference from defender Ebba Westerlind and a five-minute spearing penalty, that came with a game misconduct, from forward Moa Stridh, served by fourth-liner Greta Johansson, which certainly didn't help the Swedish squad with the game off the ice — and perhaps their mentality on the ice.\n\nThat being said, there were plenty of Swedish fans in the stands in the Cape Breton arena, wearing team jerseys, holding up brightly coloured signs, and cheering them on throughout, but the whoops and hollers were perhaps no louder than when Tilde Grillfors snuck one past American goalkeeper Bianca Birrittieri on a powerplay just over three minutes into the final frame, narrowing the gap to 7-1 for the U.S.\n\nDespite the Swedish support in the crowd, and the goalie change from starter Meja Engelin to Thea Holmberg going into the third period, there just wasn't enough time for the yellow and blue squad to catch up to the visibly stronger American team.\n\nCentre Talla Hansen scored on an Averill assist and winger Lindsay Stephnowski capped it off with help from Pohl to seal the 9-1 deal and earn a berth to Sunday's gold medal game for the United States.\n\nBirrittieri didn't earn the shutout but made a solid 17 stops for the U.S., while Engelin made a respectable 25 saves on 32 shots against. Holmberg saved seven of nine shots in her third-period appearance in the crease.\n\n\"This sucks,\" Swedish captain Ebba Westerlind told reporters matter-of-factly after the tough semifinal loss.\"We compete every time,\" she said, adding, \"the U.S.A. is really good, so we try to do our best.\"\n\n\"I think we did some good things... (but) I felt like they were first on the pucks, especially in the first period,\" she said, but pointed out \"we did better throughout the game.\"\n\nNow that Sweden is moving on from semis, it's time for \"eat, sleep, rest,\" Westerlind said of focusing on what's coming next for her country at U18 women's worlds — a chance to go home with bronze medals around their necks. \"We know we have to do the best we can... and focus on the win.\"\n\nSweden will play for bronze bragging rights earlier Sunday at Centre 200. The Swedes last won a silver medal at the 2023 IIHF Under-18 Women's World Championship, which they hosted in their home country in the northern community Ostersund.\n\nAs for the Americans, four-point contributor Pohl said, \"we don't take any of our opponents lightly.\n\n\"We knew it was going to be a good game, but I think all of us are us are prepared,\" the Woodbury, Minn., native said.\n\n\"Our coaches and teammates do a great job preparing all of us. So, (we) just (to) have fun and smile out there, and play our game that we know how to play.\"\n\nUnited States head coach Courtney Kennedy said her team was \"enjoying the moment\" of the semifinal celebration before turning thoughts to tomorrow's battle for the world championship title.\n\n\"It was a lot of work to get here,\" she said. \"I'm very proud of the players, and I'm proud of the way they played through all three periods of every single game, and it's uphill from here.\n\n\"Whoever wins this next game, we're going to have to prepare and get back to the drawing board about what we need to be successful, and both teams that we could end up playing, they're both fantastic, they're well-coached, and (Sunday) will be a hard, hard game.\"\n\n\"Tomorrow's another day,\" Kennedy said.\n\nEarlier Saturday, Finland beat Slovakia 7-1 in a relegation game, marking the first time the normally top-ranked women's hockey country, which means they'll be moving down a division in the IIHF under-18 international pool.\n\nThe large scoring gaps at this U18 worlds isn't what many fans, or serious women's hoockey watchers, want to see, as international development should be helping close these gaps to ensure competition continues to improve and the game continues to grow worldwide.\n\nSweden faces off in the bronze medal game at 3:30 p.m. AT, while the United States goes for gold at 7:30 p.m. AT.",

    "description": "Trade rumors are one thing, but being booed by your own fans is another. For Giannis Antetokounmpo, the frustration in Milwaukee has hit a new level.",
    "fullText": "Trade rumors are one thing, but being booed by your own fans is another. For Giannis Antetokounmpo, the frustration in Milwaukee has hit a new level. For the third time this season, they have lost three or more games in a row. While this may lead to some discontent, a Bucks assistant coach spills the beans on the issues in the locker room.\n\n“I think we just haven’t bought into everybody being stars in their role consistent enough,” said Rajon Rondo on the KG Certified show. “I think that’s the frustration part. Obviously, you know the big fella missed a lot of games, and you know it’s a big thing about now how we’re trying to be good without Giannis on the court. We may go in spots or lows, whereas two or three possessions where we don’t take care of the ball. That’s where the gap continues to grow.\n\nIt’s magnified now, obviously, because of trade deadlines, rumors here and there; it’s like it’s all magnified. Even though it’s a small market, it’s still the Milwaukee Bucks, and it’s Giannis’ team. So we’re going through it, but as I said, it’s the NBA grind; you can’t win a championship. But again, I just think we do have some great pieces; it’s just about everybody being consistent. That’s one of the things that we’re trying to do.\n\nAs a member of the Bucks’ 2024 coaching staff, Rondo offers a behind-the-scenes perspective on the team’s struggles. From mid-November to mid-December, the Bucks lost 13 of 16 games and remain in a Play-In berth, far below expectations.\n\nDespite a promising 4-1 start, the season has unraveled to a disappointing 17-24 record, putting a harsh spotlight on the team’s costly offseason moves. They went all in by waiving and stretching Damian Lillard’s deal, which will additionally take up $22.5 million of the Bucks’ cap space. Milwaukee also agreed to a four-year, $107 million contract with Myles Turner. With three consecutive first-round exits and numerous roster changes, Giannis Antetokounmpo remains frustrated.\n\nRondo pointed out that, given how this slump coincided with Giannis missing games, his name being constantly circled in trade rumors, and then the Bucks fans booing their own players. While the 23-year-old star is performing at his career best, the same can’t be said for the rest of the roster. Veterans such as Myles Turner, Kyle Kuzma, and Gary Trent Jr. have all seen their scoring averages dip from last season.\n\nIt doesn’t help the morale when Antetokounmpo made a social media move, leaving everyone wondering about his motives. Just a few weeks ago, the Bucks superstar deleted every single tweet dating back to July 2021. Then, insiders continued to drop trade updates, as ESPN’s Brian Windhorst confirmed that the Greek Freak had conversations with the front office during the offseason about possibly making a move to New York.\n\nDuring a humiliating 33-point loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves, Bucks fans at Fiserv Forum voiced their frustration loudly and repeatedly. The Bucks were without Myles Turner, but still fell apart against a Timberwolves team missing Anthony Edwards and Rudy Gobert. Giannis finished with 25 points on 9-of-13 shooting, eight rebounds, and five assists, but his performance was not the talking point.\n\nAt the start of the third quarter, the Bucks were already down by 31. Antetokounmpo went in for a powerful layup, finishing through contact and drawing a foul on Julius Randle. After finishing through contact for an and-one, the Greek forward turned to the home crowd and booed right back, along with two ‘thumbs-down’ gestures. But there was something more brewing underneath.\n\n“Maybe my voice is just a broken record, and guys are just tired,” Antetokounmpo said. “Being a leader is the same thing as being a dad. You’ve got to keep being available, being consistent with your words and your actions, over and over again. And one day, you hope the message is going to go through.” Giannis addressed that the Bucks understand what winning looks like, but they’re simply failing to execute the basics before schemes even matter. It signifies a disconnect between effort, accountability, and urgency, leading to frustrations.\n\nThe post Bucks Source Confirms Giannis Antetokounmpo’s Frustrations in Milwaukee Amid Trade Rumors appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIt's an unfortunate call to action for Stidham, but it also is the biggest game of his life. The upcoming AFC Championship game is the biggest game he's ever played as he's stepping in as the Denver Broncos' starting quarterback after Bo Nix suffered a season-ending ankle injury, marking his first-ever playoff start and a huge opportunity in a high-stakes game.\n\nThe 29-year old quarterback hails from a small town roughly 100 miles west of Dallas, Stephenville, TX. He was a standout in his high school days playing for Stephenville High. He emerged as one of the nation's most sought-after quarterback prospects, earning national attention, transferring south of Stephenville to Baylor in Waco, before later transferring to Auburn.\n\nWith Bo Nix out for the season, Denver’s starting QB for next Sunday’s AFC Championship Game will be Jarrett Stidham. His backup now will be Sam Ehlinger. pic.twitter.com/arNI7Xbv8C\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) January 18, 2026\n\nWhile at Auburn, he led the Tigers to memorable moments, including big wins over SEC rivals Alabama and Georgia in 2017. He led the Tigers to an SEC Championship appearance and earned Second-Team All-SEC honors, becoming the SEC Newcomer of the Year. It was his deep-ball accuracy and skillset that earned him an NFL Draft selection in 2019 by the New England Patriots.\n\nAfter three seasons with the Patriots, he was traded to the Raiders in 2022. He later signed a two-year deal with the Broncos in 2023 and then resigned in 2025. Stidham has spent much of his career as a dependable backup, occasionally stepping in when needed but never fully seizing a starting role. That all changes Sunday, as the Denver Broncos await their possible opponent tomorrow, with both the Houston Texans and New England Patriots making their case for the AFC Championship.

    "fullText": "CROOKSTON, M.N. (AUGUSTANA) – The Augustana men’s basketball team finished a perfect road weekend on Saturday afternoon, defeating Minnesota Crookston 85-77 at the Lysaker Gymnasium.\n\nThe Vikings (10-7, 8-4 NSIC) shot 51.9 percent (28 of 54) from the field and made 24 of 30 free throws while the Golden Eagles (3-15, 1-10) shot 49.2 percent (29 of 59) from the field and shot just 16 free throws, making 13 of them.\n\nTameron Ferguson scored 21 points to lead five Vikings in double figures while adding seven assists and six rebounds. Sam Rensch and Brady Helgren each scored 14 points while Rensch grabbed six rebounds and Helgren added five. Caden Hinker poured in 12 points and Amari Westmoreland-Vendiola had 11 while going 9 of 10 from the free throw line.\n\nHinker opened the game with a 3-pointer for the second consecutive game and Rensch added a jumper to give AU the first five points. The Golden Eagles scored the next six but a Ferguson layup at the 18:47 mark gave AU a 7-6 lead.\n\nThe Viking lead stretched to 14-10 when a Hinker 3-pointer and Ferguson layup broke up even play with 13:00 to go in the half. UMC scored six of the next eight points before four Rensch points contributed to a 7-0 AU run, making it 23-16 Vikings with 7:39 to go in the half.\n\nIn the final 7:39, UMC scored 12 points and AU scored 10 to bring the Vikings to a 33-28 lead at the half. Rensch and Hinker each had nine points to lead the offense.\n\nUMC opened the second half with a 13-9 run to pull within a point but Westmoreland-Vendiola knocked down a free throw and Helgren added a putback to give the Vikings a 45-41 lead with 15:08 to go in the game.\n\nAfter two more UMC free throws Helgren and Westmoreland-Vendiola each got baskets to start an 8-2 run, stretching the Viking lead to 53-45. The offense kept pushing, eventually growing the lead to 58-48 at the 10:42 mark.\n\nAfter UMC chipped back within four, Rensch, Te Slaa, Hinker and Ferguson each chipped in to bring the lead back to 10 at 68-58 with 7:03 remaining. The Viking offense kept trading baskets the rest of the way, offsetting the Golden Eagles the rest of the way until a UMC layup as time expired brought the game to its final score.\n\nThe Vikings continue their road stretch next weekend, starting with Minot State on Friday at 7:30 p.m.",

    "description": "The Toffees must hunker down and battle for everything as they await the return of their star players",
    "fullText": "Everton’s FA Cup penalty shootout defeat to Sunderland last weekend ensured that the club’s quest to end its current silverware drought would extend into a 32nd year. Whilst the manner of the exit left a sour taste, that the Blues lost was not, in itself, a surprise. Shorn of options due to injury, AFCON and suspension, David Moyes was limited in the team he could put out — signalled by the presence on the bench of only one player who’s had senior minutes this season, in Thierno Barry.\n\nThings aren’t going to get better in the short term either, with little action on the transfer front being signalled, and returning players not yet back — though Jack Grealish will be available, having completed a one-match ban. Hopefully, that situation will change by the end of the month, but for this afternoon’s road game against Aston Villa, the Toffees arrive in suboptimal condition.\n\nThe Birmingham outfit were faced with a tight position – with regard to the Premier League’s financial regulations – heading towards this season, and attempted to rectify this by moving out some significant earners, such as Philippe Coutinho and Leon Bailey, along with selling academy product Jacob Ramsey to Newcastle United for a sizeable fee (€45.2m). Several players arrived, though major funds were committed only to the purchase of Nice forward Evan Guessand (€30m), with other reinforcements arriving as loans (Jadon Sancho, Harvey Elliot), or free transfers (Viktor Lindelöf).\n\nThat the veteran former Manchester United centre half has been the one to accrue the most game time so far is indicative of a failed transfer window for Villa. Sancho has been in and out of the side, though has started two of the last four league games, but Elliot is in limbo, having played a combined 174 minutes so far across all competitions. His loan move from Liverpool will be made permanent for an agreed fee of €41m should he make ten league appearances, and Villa have apparently decided that they no longer want the man named player of the tournament during the summer’s Euro 2025 Under-21 tournament.\n\nWhen today’s hosts arrived at Hill Dickinson Stadium early in the season, they’d yet to win a game – or even score a goal – but frustrated Everton in a goalless stalemate, with a negative game plan. A couple more draws followed, but from the end of September the Midlanders embarked on a complete turnaround in form, and have won 19 from 23 in all competitions, including a run of eleven straight, which was ended only by league leaders Arsenal. They await the visitors having dispatched Tottenham Hotspur last weekend, in the FA Cup, and on an eleven game winning streak at Villa Park.\n\nVilla will almost certainly line up in a 4-2-3-1 formation.\n\nEmi Martinez faces a late fitness test, so it’s likely that experienced backup Marco Bizot will deputize. The Dutchman is an able replacement, but is nowhere near on the same level as the World Cup winner. Matty Cash will line up at right back, but on the left former Blue Lucas Digne has been alternating with Ian Maatsen. Since the younger man started against Spurs, it’s likely that the 32-year-old Digne will get the nod today. Ezri Konsa is a lock at centre half, and although Lindelöf has started the last six league games in place of the injured Pau Torres, the Spaniard was back for the cup game last weekend, so may retain his spot.\n\nVilla’s midfield will be without both ex-Toffee Amadou Onana and the excellent Boubacar Kamara, due to injury, but Youri Tielemans will look to orchestrate things from a deep position. Lamare Bogarde was handed a rare start against Everton in September, and will do so again. He’s a solid defensive midfielder, but a significant dropoff compared to Kamara, or Onana. Playing higher up will probably be Morgan Rogers, the team’s joint leading scorer, though John McGinn may do so, if Rogers is deployed wide.\n\nWith Villa having offloaded their only other senior forward, Donyell Malen to Roma a couple of days ago, the hosts will field Ollie Watkins up top. The England striker endured a slow start to the campaign, but has four goals from his last four league outings and offers an all-around package which troubles the best defenders. Unai Emery has several wide options, with Emi Buendia probably deployed on the left, and McGinn the most likely on the right, although Sancho has been starting there recently and Rogers can play anywhere behind the striker.\n\nWith the hosts in imperious form for months, and especially so at Villa Park, this presents a stern test for Everton. Grealish’s availability will give the team more quality on the ball, but otherwise this will be the same side which looked short of goal threat, and were outplayed for long stretches a week ago by a Black Cats side also missing several players due to AFCON. Needless to say, Villa are a considerably stronger proposition, and it’s tough to make much of a case for the visitors, unfortunately.\n\nIn terms of the Everton team, Moyes will likely replace Tyler Dibling – who’s been the target of much criticism from elements of the fan base recently – and move Dwight McNeil once again to right wing, in order to accommodate Grealish. Whilst Dibling has struggled in his last couple of outings, what exactly McNeil offers at this stage, and particularly when fielded on the right, is honestly a mystery. Otherwise, the only change will be Barry in for Beto, with the latter anonymous in the Cup game. Again, one man has a future at Everton, and the other does not. Forgotten man Adam Aznou enjoyed an exciting cameo against Sunderland, but it’s hard to imagine Moyes using the youngster here in any capacity, sadly.\n\nAway from home, the Toffees have fared rather better than at Hill Dickinson, having lost just once (against Chelsea) from six, picking up three wins. Admittedly, most of those games featured players like Iliman Ndiaye, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Idrissa Gueye — none of whom will be present at Villa Park this afternoon, but Everton did score a notable success without any of those against Nottingham Forest. Villa however, are not Forest and Emery is certainly not Sean Dyche. Still, the Blues will set up compactly, give a reasonable account of themselves, and although they’ll end up well beaten, I don’t foresee anything embarrassing.\n\nStatistics provided courtesy of transfermarkt.com and fbref.com",

    "description": "The San Francisco 49ers never had a chance against the Seattle Seahawks in the divisional playoffs. Here are the takeaways.",
    "fullText": "It's hard to put a bow on the San Francisco 49ers' 2025 season because of how messy the entire year was.\n\nPerhaps Saturday's blowout loss in Seattle against the Seahawks perfectly encapsulated the year. The 49ers were overwhelmed from the opening kick as the vastly more talented Seattle roster took over the game early and never stopped.\n\nHere's what we took away from a dreary 49ers performance in the divisional playoffs:\n\nSan Francisco looked like a team that didn't run out of gas, but rather showed up to the game on empty. They got off to a horrendous start and put themselves in a 17-0 hole against a Seattle club that was fresh off its bye week. As the game wore on, the 49ers looked substantially worse and the 17-0 lead turned into a rout. They were never going to stop the avalanche once the game got out of hand.\n\nThe game was effectively over in the first two possessions. Seattle returned the opening kickoff for a touchdown to go ahead 7-0. San Francisco got the ball at the 40 to start their first possession and had a little success moving the ball. They got into a second-and-3, and running back Brian Robinson was stopped short with a two-yard run. On third-and-1 the 49ers lost a yard with a handoff to Christian McCaffrey. Then they tried some trickery with an option play that lost three yards on fourth-and-1. Seattle took the short field and made it 10-0. On the 49ers' next drive they were moving again with Jake Tonges catching a throw for 11 yards on second-and-7, but he fumbled. Seattle took over on the 49ers 43 and cruised in for a touchdown to go ahead 17-0. That was it.\n\nThe game script didn't help the 49ers offense and Purdy for most of the second half was under heavy pressure, but he was also not effective. He missed some key throws, turned the ball over twice, and in general didn't do enough to elevate his club. Injuries matter, but the Seahawks are in the 49ers' division and not going away any time soon. Purdy has to be better moving forward because he was not good enough to keep the game from getting out of hand.\n\nIt looked like the 49ers were going to get on the edge of the red zone when Brock Purdy fired a throw in to Pearsall for a first down on third-and-6 in the second quarter. With the score 17-3, a touchdown on the drive would've made things very interesting. Replay assist ruled the catch an incompletion, however, forcing the 49ers to settle for a 56-yard field goal that trimmed the deficit to 17-6. Field goals were never going to get it done with this 49ers defense.\n\nTonges played well, but the 49ers' offense just has a little less juice when Kittle isn't on the field. His blocking was missed in the run game where the 49ers had a rough time getting to the edge. Purdy was also clearly uncomfortable without his favorite target on the field. Kittle not being on the field wasn't why the 49ers lost, but it was very clear how much he matters for their offense.\n\nThe rookie safety started with Ji'Ayir Brown on the sidelines because of a hamstring injury. Sigle's long stint on the sideline as a reserve came back to bite the 49ers in the biggest game of the year. Sigle got lost on the Seahawks first touchdown, and then got thrown in the blender on their second score before missing a tackle on Kenneth Walker. Saturday night doesn't define him, but it was clear San Francisco's young player who didn't get a ton of burn this year wasn't ready to contribute in a meaningful way.\n\nLuter got flambeed twice in the first half. First, he got cooked by Jaxon Smith-Njigba for a touchdown. Then on a vital third-and-10 late in the first half he was beat bad by Jake Bobo who had only two catches during the regular season. The 49ers probably need to invest in their CB depth in the offseason.\n\nGood for the rookie fourth-round pick. He got in the game early in the third quarter because Christian McCaffrey was on the sideline with a shoulder issue. James took his first-career carry for seven yards. He finished the game with 28 yards on six carries.\n\nWhen the 49ers defense did pop Saturday night it was typically Winters making a play. He racked up nine tackles, including three tackles for loss.\n\nMore 49ers: 49ers superstar named winner of the 2026 Bart Starr Award\n\nThis article originally appeared on Niners Wire: 49ers vs. Seahawks: 7 takeaways, standout players from dreary SF loss",

But the Lakers still had LeBron James and they hoped he could carry them past Portland.\n\nStarters Luka Doncic (left groin soreness) and Deandre Ayton (left knee soreness) did not play. In the fourth quarter, Marcus Smart went down amid a pile of players in the lane and eventually limped to the locker room never to return.\n\nAs for James and the rest of the Lakers, all of the injuries were too much to overcome in a 132-116 loss to the Trail Blazers at the Moda Center.\n\nSmart had 25 points before he went to the locker room. James had 20 points but was just six for 16 from the field. He had nine rebounds and eight assists for a Lakers team that has lost five of its last six games.\n\nDrew Timme was a positive for the Lakers, scoring a career-high 21 points. Rui Hachimura and Maxi Kleber each had 11 points.\n\nShaedon Sharpe led Portland (21-22) with 25 points. Jerami Grant and Caleb Love each scored 22 points and Donovan Clingan finished with 18 points and 11 rebounds.\n\nDoncic, who underwent an MRI and is listed as day-to-day, was dealing with the injury all of last week despite playing against the Kings, Hawks and Hornets.\n\n“I think it was an accumulation of a longer week, more lingering, if anything,” Lakers coach JJ Redick said before the game.\n\nThe Lakers (24-16) aren't sure if Ayton will play against Toronto on Sunday. The center is day-to-day with left knee soreness.\n\n“He took a hit in his knee and there was no swelling, just some soreness,” Redick said.\n\nThe Lakers were also without backup center Jaxson Hayes, who didn’t play against the Trail Blazers because of left hamstring tendinopathy. Redick said there's a chance Hayes could play Sunday.\n\nJames missed his first five shots in the first quarter, finishing one-for-seven from the field for just two points.\n\nThe Lakers were called for 13 fouls in the first quarter, leading to 22 free-throw attempts for the Trail Blazers, a big reason why they opened a 40-27 lead after the first 12 minutes of play.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "Seattle's level of domination has set the bar incredibly high for whoever wins the frozen showdown between the Chicago Bears and Los Angeles Rams.",
    "fullText": "Seattle laid its claim for the NFL throne in the exact way it did during its dominant run toward the NFC’s No. 1 seed: by ferociously pummeling their opponent without mercy.\n\nThe Seahawks’ offense had a productive, albeit somewhat ugly game Saturday night against the San Francisco 49ers, but Seattle’s defense (and special teams!) stole the show in this 41-6 divisional round wipeout. Now Seattle is a game away from getting back to the Super Bowl for the first time in over a decade.\n\nIt’s a playoff position star defender DeMarcus Lawrence, who had a strip sack of Brock Purdy late in the second half, hasn’t seen in his career after spending 11 seasons with the Dallas Cowboys. His prophetic words from last March about leaving Dallas for Seattle in free agency made a comeback on social media after the Seahawks’ emphatic win. And they’re bound to have some staying power this coming week as the Seahawks prepare for the NFC title game. But what else stuck out for Lawrence that symbolized this tenacious defense was the new necklace he sported postgame with the initials: MOB.\n\nNew “MOB” necklace for DeMarcus Lawrence looks like it wasn’t free pic.twitter.com/sYP7WASZPE\n\n— Mike Sando (@SandoNFL) January 18, 2026\n\n“Yeah, brand new MOB necklace, man,” Lawrence said. “You know, just letting the world know how we coming, you know.”\n\nIn a league where offenses and quarterbacks are the stars of the show, Seattle has built a defense that’s just as compelling as the biggest, flashiest arms in the NFL and they showed that they’re absolutely good enough to ride to a title.\n\nSeattle didn't even let the 49ers get into the game, doing the same thing it did during the Week 18 regular-season finale when it stifled the 49ers’ running game, which subsequently forced Brock Purdy to be a dropback passer and throw into the teeth of an immovable defense. This weekend, the Seahawks held the 49ers to 28 yards on 11 designed runs in the first half, and again forced the 49ers to play a style of football they don’t want to play.\n\nThe Seahawks forced their second turnover on downs of the night to open the third quarter, the offense rewarded the defense with a field goal and the 21-point deficit was too much against Seattle’s marauding defense.\n\nThis is the kind of performance that No. 1 seeds should have against weaker opponents in their conference. Not that the 49ers are a bad team, they’re just an absurdly injured one. But this level of domination has set the bar incredibly high for whoever wins the frozen showdown between the Chicago Bears and Los Angeles Rams. In a season when head coach Kyle Shanahan had all the answers as the 49ers’ lineups shifted and became more depleted, the Seahawks were all over everything he tried to throw out. Not only are they talented, they’re incredibly well-orchestrated with second-year head coach Mike Macdonald pulling all the strings on defense.\n\nThe 49ers didn’t even reach the red zone in this game and this was an offense that ranked top-three in most standard and advanced metrics over the back half of the season. It’s not like the Seahawks have been padding their stats against the worst teams that the league has to offer. This status is earned through trial. The only offense to put up over 20 points on Seattle over the final nine weeks of the season has been the Rams (the Titans scored 24 but they had a 90-yard punt return touchdown). They’ve given up 75 points since Week 13 with 37 of those points, legitimately half, coming against the Rams.\n\nTeams need to be as dialed in, talented and well-coached as the Rams to really score against this defense. The run the Seahawks are on will go down in the record books as an all-time finish if they can maintain this level of defensive dominance against one of two of the better offenses in the NFL. In the Rams’ case, they’re probably just the flat-out best offense period this season.\n\nThat creates a potentially fascinating third matchup between the Seahawks and their division rival Rams, but L.A. still has to get there first. Caleb Williams and the Bears are no pushover at this point, but when Seattle stuffs Shanahan and the 49ers in a locker for the second time in three weeks, it's hard not to feel like this is the current favorite for the Super Bowl. Seattle’s defense is really that good and it has one of the elite special teams units in the entire league, as shown by Rashid Shaheed’s 95-yard opening kickoff return for a touchdown.\n\nThe health of the Bears or Rams will likely create a tougher test than what the 49ers were able to muster, but this defense is playing as well as a unit possibly can in the modern NFL and the Seahawks seem to be getting better each week. No matter who shows up to face the Seahawks next Sunday, the only thing louder than Lumen Field will be the boom this defense brings seemingly every single play.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nComing into Saturday’s playoff matchup, the Denver Broncos led the NFL in penalty yards, yet discipline was not an issue for Denver. Instead, penalties proved costly for Buffalo.\n\nThe Broncos edged the Bills 33–30 in overtime in the divisional round at Mile High, and flags played a decisive role on the final drive.\n\nOn the possession that set up Wil Lutz’s game-winning field goal, Buffalo was twice called for defensive pass interference. The Bills surrendered 47 penalty yards on that drive alone, allowing Denver to move comfortably down the field for the final points of the game.\n\nMORE: Writing Broncos were disciplined after leading the league in penalties entering the game\n\nTaron Johnson was first flagged for defensive pass interference after tightly covering Courtland Sutton on an incompletion, taking him to the ground as the ball arrived. Whether the call was justified or not, Joey Bosa’s penalty would have given Denver yardage regardless, as the Broncos picked up 17 yards on the play.\n\nThe decisive moment for Buffalo came two plays later. Facing 2nd & 12 and already within long field-goal range, Nix threw deep to Marvin Mims, who was covered by Tre’Davious White. This DPI was more apparent, as White began tackling Mims before the ball arrived.\n\nMORE: Broncos' Jarrett Stidham set for football history not done in NFL since Cowboys' Roger Staubach in 1972\n\nEntering the game, referee Carl Cheffers and his crew were known for calling a higher-than-average number of penalties. Additionally, Denver had been the most penalized team in the league—particularly for defensive pass interference—while Josh Allen had drawn the most penalties that resulted in points. Despite those trends, the Broncos’ secondary remained disciplined, as Denver was flagged just three times for 20 yards in the entire game.\n\nJa'Quan McMillian OT interception: How Broncos cornerback stole ball from Brandin Cooks and saved Denver's season\n\nJa'Quan McMillian OT interception: How Broncos cornerback stole ball from Brandin Cooks and saved Denver's season\n\nExploring 5 wild Broncos QB options including Tom Brady, Cam Newton, Russell Wilson and more after Bo Nix injury\n\nCould Broncos sign Colin Kaepernick?

    "fullText": "Manchester United completely dominated the 198th Manchester derby, eventually emerging 2-0 winners at Old Trafford on Saturday.\n\nIt was Manchester City’s biggest xG loss since Pep Guardiola took charge, and the scoreline could have easily read 5-0 if not for marginal offside calls and the post coming in between twice.\n\nMichael Carrick got his gameplan spot on, with the caretaker head coach playing players in their natural positions.\n\nFor far too long under Ruben Amorim, the team tried to play in a way that deviated from the club’s history.\n\nAt times on Saturday, it was eerily reminiscent of how the Red Devils used to play under Sir Alex Ferguson, keeping things compact at the back before springing on the counter.\n\nEverytime City attacked, they looked even more vulnerable when the possession was turned over. The first goal was the perfect evidence.\n\nUnited legend Peter Schmeichel attested to the fact, claiming to Premier League Productions that Carrick had restored the United DNA in a very short amount of time.\n\n“There was there was no restraint. Go forward. And we saw that in the first goal you had, you know, it’s a defending, it’s a free kick that Harry heads it out, and all of a sudden they’re four against two.\n\n“That’s not something I’ve seen for a very, very long time with Manchester United. But that is what Manchester United is historically always has been able to do.\n\n“You know, as soon as the ball is won, you go forward and you don’t think about what’s going to happen behind you.\n\n“That I think is something they’ve been talking to them about a lot that when you get that opportunity and it was fantastic.”\n\nIt made for stunning viewing for fans, who will be hoping for more of the same next week when the 20-time English league champions take on Arsenal at the Emirates.\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "title": "Obituary: Former Sunderland Defender Alan Black",
    "description": "Roker Report pays tribute to former player Alan Black, who passed away earlier this week.",
    "fullText": "Everybody at Roker Report was saddened to learn of the death of former Sunderland player Alan Black, who passed away recently at the age of 82. The following is an updated version of an article that was originally published in 2024 to celebrate his 81st birthday…\n\nHaving joined from Dumbarton Alan Black provided cover mainly for club stalwart Len Ashurst, which in turn enabled John Parke to take over from the injured Cec Irwin, yet the sixties signing didn’t disgrace himself in Sunderland colours and would go on to enjoy a more prominent role at his next destination.\n\nBorn in June 1943, Black grew up in Alexandria – the same western Scotland town as Bobby Kerr. Having begun at Drumchapel Amateurs, as a youngster he turned down the opportunity to play for Blackpool and opted to remain at semi-professional Dumbarton instead so that he could continue his engineering apprenticeship. Once his studies were done though he accepted the offer of a month-long trial at Roker and before it was even complete had agreed to leave the Sons and join the Lads on a permanent basis.\n\nMoving in September 1964 when the board were overseeing the majority of first team affairs prior to the appointment of George Hardwick, Black made his debut the following February with something of a baptism of fire, but despite facing a Manchester United side that included the great ‘Trinity’ of Bobby Charlton, Denis Law and George Best, he helped secure a clean sheet and narrow victory against the Red Devils – fellow Scot Harry Hood getting the only goal in front of a 51,000 strong crowd.\n\nThree days later Sunderland were in the capital to play Fulham and despite defeat he gave a solid showing. This was to be Black’s last game of 1964-65 however, and it wasn’t until October that he resurfaced, deputising for Ashurst once again in another away match at West Bromwich Albion.\n\nNow working under his countryman Ian McColl, he followed that up with another appearance seven days later, when he came on for the injured Jimmy Montgomery in the last few minutes of a thrilling win over Nottingham Forest. Martin Harvey went in goal in place of Monty, with Black slotting into the defence after becoming only the second ever substitute in a competitive Sunderland fixture – he may have also been involved in midweek too had the League Cup permitted substitutes, as fellow Parke was forced to limp on in a tie against Aston Villa despite taking a heavy whack.\n\nThere were to be two more outings for Black during the campaign, both coming away from home in a draw at Sheffield United and then a during a defeat to Liverpool. Having played the full 90 at Bramall Lane he then came on from the bench again on Merseyside the following weekend, and whilst the Lads were already trailing when introduced this proved to be his final game for the club.\n\nBlack left Sunderland a little over a week before the 2nd anniversary of him signing full time. One of several reserves that McColl was willing to part with as he looked to raise funds for incoming deals, the £9,000 Norwich City forked out soon looked like good business – their new arrival debuting later that evening in a 2-1 win at Northampton Town. His Canaries bow proved to be a good precursor to the rest of his time at Carrow Road too, where he became a crowd favourite and featured in the Division Two championship winning season of 1971-72.\n\nAfter playing over 200 times for the team, including five instances of him lining up against Sunderland, Black returned to Dumbarton in 1973 but was soon forced to retire due to knee problems. The Norwich title win, which had included a return to Wearside during the run in for a 1-1 draw, meant the club had reached the topflight for the first time – a feat that contributed towards Black subsequently being inducted into their Hall of Fame and gladly accepting many subsequent invites back to Norfolk.\n\nIt was in his native Dumbartonshire region though where he lived, remaining there once his football career was over and making use of his familiarity with the area by becoming a taxi driver. Rest in peace Alan, and best wishes to his loved ones from all at Roker Report.\n\n*The photograph at the start of this piece shows Alan celebrating the Durham Challenge Cup that he won whilst playing for Sunderland reserves during 1965-66. The team beat West Auckland 3-2 in the final at Darlington and alongside him are Keenan (l) and Campbell (r).",

    "fullText": "I thought Hume played very well.\n\nWhenever people discuss a predicted team, it’s Hume that gets the push. He’s not always guaranteed his right back berth but it’s not a problem as he can slot in at left back or more recently, in midfield. He was also the creator of a few deft moves and had one or two chances himself.\n\nYou can’t keep Northern Ireland’s man of the moment down. Mentions as always for Nordi Mukiele, Granit Xhaka and Enzo Le Fée, but I was impressed with Hume.\n\nAnother victory from a losing position — epitomised by Brian Brobbey, who got his usual battering but kept on going and got a very deserved goal.\n\nThis team doesn’t give up. Big hearts, big engines and big desire.\n\nWe were very open at the back, especially in the early stages of the first half.\n\nCrystal Palace had several breaks that on another day could have seen us 0-2 down before we got going. Luckily, as usual, Régis Le Bris and the team sorted it out and we became more solid and more assured.\n\nThe first few home games this season had most people staying until the final whistle, but the early leavers are back.\n\nThey stop in the gangways and block people’s view, then everyone has to stand. It’s a free country, but does anyone leave the theatre or cinema early?\n\nAn amazing winner from Brobbey underlined his value to our team.\n\nHe battled throughout, showing his strength and skill. It’s really important to have the outlet that the big Dutchman provides — and the finish off the underside of the bar was truly remarkable.\n\nThis was another game during which nobody could be faulted for their performance, and the team we support is so much more than a group of talented individuals.\n\nWe have players that genuinely care about the city, the fans, and where we finish in this league.\n\nI love that about these players — they sweat blood for each other and that’s very reassuring.\n\nIs there a pattern developing that to start dominating home games, we need to go behind? Six of the eleven home games have followed this script.\n\nOur head coach has a Ph.D. in sports performance so he may have some insights he can share. As a fan, I find it quite relaxing to follow home games, with two rules: A. Don’t worry if we concede first, and B. We’re not going to lose anyway.\n\nThis is an amazing way to enjoy and take in matches.\n\nI can’t come up with anything negative. This was a much-needed and deserved victory; we’re getting our best players back and it all bodes well for the rest of the season.\n\nHappy times to be a Sunderland fan.\n\nHistorically, going 0-1 down at home would be the beginning of the end.\n\nHowever, this team is different and the resilience demonstrated to not just get back into the game but to then go on and win it was admirable. What certainly helps, though, is the crowd, as nobody was getting on the players’ backs when we conceded.\n\nInstead, there was an encouraging roar and it helped solidify our unbeaten home form.\n\nConsidering that we signed Brobbey on deadline day, it’s incredible to think that he’s turning into one of our most important signings of the transfer window.\n\nHis strength and ability to pin in three centre backs is undoubtedly a huge reason why we got three points this afternoon — and that’s without even talking about the finish, which was absolutely sublime.\n\nA class footballer and I can’t wait to see how he continues to develop.\n\nI can’t help but feel that at times, that we’re in a time machine and have been transported back to League One when it comes to referees. The “main event” energy that’s surrounded the last few officials has been suitably minging to watch.\n\nIf there’s one thing that’s bound to get on the collective tits of everyone at the Stadium of Light, it’s inconsistency.\n\nThis referee personified that and some of the decisions that Jean-Philippe Mateta was able to get compared to Brobbey was just ridiculous.\n\nWhen we’re 2-1 up in a close game, I find it baffling that anybody would leave.\n\nWe ask the team to give 100% until the final whistle and given that we just have to sit there, it’s not difficult to ask for everyone to stay until the game ends, not least of all to give the team the credit and appreciation they deserve after such a fantastic performance.\n\nOur big number nine was my man of the match. His hold-up play got us up the park and his battle with the Palace defenders rarely went their way.\n\nHow he managed to score a goal by putting the ball over the keeper and under the bar is beyond me.\n\nAnother great performance, with a goal and a hell of a shift put in.\n\nThe man covers every blade of grass on the pitch and is as strong in defence as he is in attack\n\nAfter his panenka nightmare, he’s recovered and kicked on massively — and the love for Le Fée is clear from the songs we all sing.\n\nThe chances for Brobbey and Trai Hume earlier in the game should’ve been converted — both great moments for us but not taken advantage of.\n\nWe didn’t suffer from that lack of clinical finishing, but on another day, we may have done.\n\nThe gaffer left it until about ten minutes before the end before putting any fresh legs on.\n\nGiven the way we harried and pressed Palace, we may have closed the game out sooner with fresh limbs, but what do I know that the French professor doesn’t?\n\nI’m clutching for a second “down”, because to be honest, there aren’t many options.\n\nThe Stadium of Light is still a fortress. We’re the comeback kings — and we’re in the top eight and above the scum.\n\nNot sure it gets a lot better than that.\n\nBrobbey was fouled all game and got no protection from the referee, but ultimately had the last laugh by scoring a winner which had people scratching their heads asking “How did he do that?”.\n\nHe was a handful from start to finish; a proper, old-fashioned centre-forward, bullying the Palace defence. His footwork was a little awry in the first half, as he had a few chances where the ball got under his feet.\n\nHowever, his persistence paid off with a fabulous winner in the 71st minute, as he dinked the ball into the net from five yards out.\n\nHow did we pick him up for such a ridiculous fee?\n\n£9.5 million plus add-ons seems like absolute daylight robbery for a player who provided the assist for Enzo Le Fée’s opening goal and should’ve been awarded a penalty when Romaine Mundle was bundled over in the penalty area when he received another cross from Mukiele.\n\nMukiele and Brobbey were given yellow cards for telling the ref to stop the constant and persistent fouling by Palace’s defence.\n\nBrobbey was constantly being fouled and manhandled — so much so that I got a little concerned that he might be provoked into kicking out. Thankfully, he kept his head and had the last laugh, but the referee had to give our players better protection. He also missed a stonewall penalty as Romaine Mundle was bundled down in the box after receiving a cross from Nordi Mukiele.\n\nGranit Xhaka turned in an uncharacteristically hesitant display in the middle of the park and almost gifted Palace an opener.\n\nWe looked indecisive and tentative at times, but things improved in the second half as Régis Le Bris had looked quite annoyed as he headed down the tunnel for the half time break.",

    "description": "This is ‘New Sunderland’. We are a side whose heads are incapable of dropping, and as a result, seem to almost be galvanised by conceding.",
    "fullText": "After two weeks of back-page murmurs and speculation, Sunderland finally ‘joined the chat’ in the January transfer market, announcing the acquisition of Jocelin Ta Bi — a reportedly crafty winger from Israeli side Maccabi Netanya.\n\nFashionably going by his first name on the back of his shirt, à la trendsetters ‘Virgil’ van Dijk, as well as most of the Brazilian national side, the forward has averted any prospective mix-up with our other right-winger Chemsdine Talbi, much to the relief of commentary teams across the land.\n\nThis Christian-name-on-back-of-shirt fad had me thinking: imagine our entire squad followed suit, all in the name of self-promotion and personal brand.\n\nWe’d have a trio of Brian, Simon, and Wilson leading the line – names of middle-aged fellas you’d find perusing the Daily Mail down at any Wetherspoons, lapping up the latest Reform UK drivel. Not forgetting their mate, Dennis, who, unlike the rest of them, still has all his hair and teeth.\n\nYet, perhaps the best of the lot would be the outgoing Blondy. Presumably, a player named after either Debbie Harry or his definitely-not-dyed peroxide hair.\n\nAnyway, enough on player first names and more on Saturday’s game with Crystal Palace: a side who ended last season with an FA Cup triumph, and started this campaign with a Community Shield win and European qualification.\n\nOn paper a very solid outfit, but contextually anything but. They are a club seemingly in free-fall, with stalwart Marc Guéhi poised to join Manchester City, while boss Oliver Glasner tendered his resignation in midweek.\n\nThat said, while Régis Le Bris has worked wonders in distancing us from that Sunderland-y reputation that once preceded us, Yeremy Pino’s opener following our pretty solid start was very on-brand for the Sunderland of old.\n\nThere were several dips in concentration, with Robin Roefs being called into action on a few occasions, including to deny Jean-Philippe Mateta early on. A rare defensive lapse saw Palace’s only real creative outlet on the day, deftly place it beyond Roefs. It was a pretty sloppy goal to concede, made more frustrating by the fact that it was straight from a set-piece.\n\nNevertheless, this is ‘New Sunderland’. We are a side whose heads are incapable of dropping, and as a result, seem to almost be galvanised by conceding.\n\nIt took just three minutes for Enzo Le Fée to restore parity. Following an intricate bit of interplay down our left side, the Frenchman guided Nordi Mukiele’s low-driven cross into the bottom corner with effortless finesse.\n\nAfter the break, there was only one team out to win it. Our second-half display really exhibited us at our very best; defensively solid, tenacious in midfield, and potent in the transition.\n\nIn the 71st minute, Noah Sadiki’s line-splitting through-ball put Brian Brobbey in on goal, and with a sublime stroke of his right boot, our £20 million Dutchman half-scooped-half-thumped it over Dean Henderson, who was left helpless as the ball satisfyingly sailed in off the bar. 2-1.\n\nWhile our visitors probed in the dying embers, we remained dogged at the back, and could so very easily have made it three via a sumptuous back-to-front move which ultimately saw Trai Hume clip the top of the crossbar.\n\nWith three points under our belt, breaking the string of five games without a win, and protecting our unbeaten home record, this was another superb afternoon on Wearside.\n\nRumour has it that Brobbey would not have had to be surgically removed from his back if he had not been substituted, as Maxence Lacroix would have had to be removed due to the defender’s persistent, unpunished fouling of our number nine.\n\nBrobbey cramping up after his goal was actually due to the fact he had been supporting the body mass of two men all game.\n\nAlthough Granit Xhaka had a poor afternoon by his impeccably high standards, I was, once again, left speechless by the collective effort of the team. From Mukiele’s marauding runs down the centre of the pitch, Noah Sadiki’s unrelenting press, and Le Fée’s class to Omar Alderete’s trivela cross, I thought there were standout moments for all involved.\n\nA victory that propels us up to eighth, three points off fourth and back above those lot up the road (even if it’s only temporarily) — the boys in red and white have delivered once more.",

    "description": "As I headed home, I was left with one overriding impression – Sunderland AFC and the city the club calls home are marching together in lockstep towards a long-overdue renaissance in their fortunes.",
    "fullText": "We normally drive up from Yorkshire for home games but, for a variety of reasons, I attended the game against Crystal Palace on my own. A quick check of rail fares meant that the Grand Central return ticket was less than £20 (courtesy of being an old git with a Senior railcard) so, accompanied by a Sainsbury’s meal deal and a couple of cans of JD and Coke, I took the relaxing option to head north.\n\nArriving in Sunderland, I followed the crowds heading for the Keel Crossing. It has been several years since I made the journey from the city centre to the SoL on foot and, for someone who grew up in Seaburn and Roker in the 60s, when the sides of the Wear were dominated by the shipyards of Austin & Pickersgill, Doxfords and others, it was something of a revelation!\n\nAs I headed towards the recently opened bridge, the evidence of redevelopment was all around me. New buildings and sites surrounded by Heras fencing, awaiting construction, were everywhere.\n\nThe new bridge afforded a wonderful view of the iconic Wearmouth Bridge, through the crowds of supporters making their way to the game, whilst the Stadium of Light itself appeared even more imposing in the distance, from an angle I have never approached it from before. At the other end of the bridge, much of the derelict buildings that had blighted the area for so long have either been refurbished or replaced – the tasteful redevelopment of the historic Sheepfolds Stables is particularly impressive. Of course, the area has been neglected for decades, and there is still much work to be done.\n\nThe return journey in the dark, with the opposite bank of the bridge all lit up, around City Hall, was the perfect illustration of how bright the future of the city is looking.\n\nIn between, there was the small matter of a fixture against Crystal Palace, who should have been in disarray after the loss of captain Marc Guéhi and the announcement that Oliver Glasner would leave at the end of the season. It proved to be far from the case, with the physically imposing Jean-Philippe Mateta proving a real handful for Dan Ballard. The French striker hit the back of the net with a beautiful piece of control leading to a lethal strike, only to see his effort ruled offside.\n\nAt the opposite end of the pitch, Brian Brobbey must have thought he had mistakenly wandered into an MMA cage, as he was repeatedly pushed, pulled, and held without evoking any interest from referee Rob Jones.\n\nA failure to clear the lines after a corner – which came after Jones awarded a contentious free-kick to the away side – led to Palace opening the scoring, and it looked like the Lads were in for a difficult afternoon. But, with Enzo Le Fée pushing up closer to Brobbey, a well-worked cross from Nordi Mukiele found the mercurial little Frenchman. The defenders were already drawn towards Brobbey, leaving Enzo to stroke the ball home emphatically to level the scores, before half-time.\n\nSunderland started the second half much more aggressively. As the rough treatment of Brobbey continued, referee Jones’ already limited control of the game threatened to disappear altogether, in a flurry of yellow cards. But the burly Dutch striker would have the last laugh. Noah Sadiki burst forward, driving at the Palace defence before chipping the ball towards Brobbey. Just as he had done against Arsenal, he deftly flicked the ball over the advancing goalkeeper and into the net, before collapsing with cramp into the advertising hoardings, in front of a delirious home end.\n\nSunderland continued to press and Trai Hume was denied by Henderson and the bar, much to my disappointment as I had a bet on the Irishman to score!\n\nMayenda replaced the tiring Brobbey and as Palace pushed forward unsuccessfully in search of an equaliser, both he and Dan Ballard were denied from close range by Dean Henderson. Dennis Cirkin replaced Romaine Mundle in the dying minutes – the young winger having shown that he is adapting to the demands of Premier League football, linking up effectively with Sadiki and Reinildo on the left, and contributing defensively. Chemsdine Talbi is due back after the AFCON final but he has had little game time in the past few weeks, so having other options is essential for Le Bris.\n\nThere was a particularly significant moment as the players left the field. Normally the celebrating fans sing in praise of Granit Xhaka – instead the strains of ‘We’ve got Le Fée’ rang out in unison, his misfortune in the Brentford game banished to the annals of history. Afterwards, he spoke about how important the support of the crowd meant to him, a salutary reminder of how much we react as fans can impact our players.\n\nAnother comeback win, up to eighth place in the League, unbeaten at home, another three points on the board and just seven more needed in 16 games to reach the magic 40-point mark – all in all, a very satisfactory afternoon’s work by the Lads. For a returning son of the city, it was equally pleasing to see the upturn in the area which surrounds the Stadium of Light.\n\nAs I headed home, I was left with one overriding impression – Sunderland AFC and the city the club calls home are marching together in lockstep towards a long-overdue renaissance in their fortunes.",

    "description": "One confirmed exit and several unresolved situations have left Barça navigating a familiar balancing act.",
    "fullText": "FC Barcelona are used to conversations about patience when it comes to young midfielders. This winter, that patience is being tested from several angles at once.\n\nThe most jarring case is that of Dro Fernández. The 18-year-old has opted to trigger his €6m release clause this January, a move that caught those inside the Ciutat Esportiva off guard. His departure is particularly stinging because his trajectory under Hansi Flick was pointing upward. Flick took him on the preseason tour, handed him a senior debut, and trusted him with starts against high-level opposition like Atlético Madrid.\n\nFlick was reportedly “furious” to learn of the decision. Recently, he said it was one of the biggest disappointments in his life, as Deco had been working behind the scenes to secure a renewal. But the outside interest proved too much, and the decision is already made. Dro has agreed a move to Paris Saint-Germain, bringing a swift conclusion to months of speculation.\n\nDro’s exit may not be the last for Barcelona’s midfielders. For Marc Casadó, the situation remains complicated. Despite being one of Flick’s early success stories, even earning a Spain call-up, the return of Frenkie de Jong has pushed Casadó to the side. The youngster’s role has shrunk. This season he has logged 871 minutes across 19 appearances, starting 10 times and being substituted at half time on two occasions.\n\nLast summer, Barcelona were prepared to entertain a €30m offer from West Ham, only for Flick to intervene. Now, the player’s own stance has shifted.\n\nAccording to Marca, Casadó is increasingly open to a move to protect his spot in Luis de la Fuente’s Spain squad ahead of the World Cup. Atlético Madrid are watching closely. Flush with cash from the €40m sale of Conor Gallagher to Tottenham, Diego Simeone is looking for midfield reinforcements, and Casadó fits the profile.\n\nMarc Bernal presents a more nuanced case. After losing a year to a cruciate ligament injury just as the Flick era began, his return in September has been handled with caution. With only 273 minutes across 12 appearances, Bernal was considered a potential candidate for a January loan. Girona emerged as a primary suitor.\n\nHowever, a recent Copa del Rey start against Racing Santander may have changed things. Bernal played an hour, and despite the physical toll, the experience was enough to convince him he can still contribute at Barça. Mundo Deportivo reports that Bernal is now leaning toward staying.\n\nDe Jong and Pedri remain locked as the starters in the midfield two, plus there’s Gavi’s return in the long run. And with Fermín López and Dani Olmo vying for the spot behind the striker, a place also sometimes occupied by Raphinha, it’s not easy to get minutes there, either.\n\nHaving already lost one young midfielder to the transfer market, Barcelona will be eager not to lose any more.",

    "description": "Phil West looks at the main stories from the Lads’ victory over the Eagles — an impressive and key win!",
    "fullText": "After a Christmas and New Year run that hardly represented a “slump” but was marked by one or two less-than-convincing displays and culminated in a disappointing defeat at the hands of Brentford, this felt like an ideal opportunity for the Lads to rediscover the winning habit, given that our immediate run of fixtures feels extremely favourable and could essentially see Sunderland edge over the safety line with ample room to spare.\n\nDoubtless reinvigorated by last weekend’s FA Cup success and with Noah Sadiki and Reinildo returning to the Stadium of Light following their AFCON odyssey, Régis Le Bris’ men recovered from the concession of a strange-looking goal from Yéremy Pino to overturn the deficit with strikes from Enzo Le Fée and Brian Brobbey, and adding to an ever-growing list of Crystal Palace problems in the process, with manager Oliver Glasner already on the way out and captain Marc Guéhi seemingly bound for Manchester City.\n\nAhead of the game, I felt the visitors from south London weren’t to be underestimated — this division has a habit of punishing such mindsets — but despite falling behind, it was hard not to be impressed with the resilience and focus demonstrated by Sunderland, and after an energetic, potent and generally dominant second half display, we ran out as deserved winners against a side for whom choppy waters may lie ahead.\n\nIf the signing of the powerful Dutchman from Ajax represented something of a gamble during the summer transfer window, he’s starting to repay the transfer fee and then some, because this was as dynamic, impactful and downright brutal a display as I’ve seen from a Sunderland striker in years.\n\nIt wasn’t just the goal (itself a very well-taken second half strike that gave us a lead we would never relinquish) — it was the way he set about the visiting defence, rarely letting them settle, holding the ball up and bringing his teammates into play — as well as taking more than his fair share of the lumps along the way.\n\nTo my eyes at least, Brobbey seems to relish such battles and when he left the pitch to a standing ovation late in the second half, it felt as much in response to his all-round display and the sheer workload he’d blasted through as it did for what proved to be the winning goal.\n\nHe’s looking ever more like a perfect fit for this side and he’s becoming a very popular figure with the red and white faithful. Keep going, Brian!\n\n“You want a response? I’ll give you a response!”\n\nOK, perhaps I’m being presumptuous and putting words into the mouth of the French magician but after recent events and all that talk about how he “owed us” (he didn’t, by the way), why should we not celebrate the fact that this sublimely gifted footballer both plays for and has clearly taken to life at Sunderland AFC as much as any other player in the squad?\n\nHe slotted home the equaliser following a sharp Sunderland break and as is generally the case every time he takes to the field, he was more or less everywhere, carrying his share of the load in both attack and defence — importantly so, because Granit Xhaka and Noah Sadiki weren’t at their best yesterday — which went a long way towards the eventual victory.\n\nIf I was a young Sunderland fan, I’d be starry-eyed when watching Le Fée. As it is, I’m thirty six, I’m increasingly grumpy and I don’t move very quickly — and I’m still starry-eyed when I watch Le Fée. He’s just so good.\n\nHe got a warm reception when he came out to warm up and as Régis Le Bris has previously disclosed, Neil remains a professional presence within the home dressing room at the Stadium of Light, but it’s also hard to escape the reality that this chapter appears to be drawing to a close and that the former skipper will soon be moving on to pastures new.\n\nSunderland AFC is now a very different club to the organization that Neil played such a key role in restoring to its place among the elite of English football, but if this was the latest waypoint on his long goodbye to Wearside, there was no hint of bad feelings or bitterness, and in an era when players often don’t think twice about throwing tantrums if things don’t work out behind the scenes, that says something about Neil’s approach to football and his respect for our club.",

    "description": "Mick Buxton’s Sunderland needed a replay plus extra time to overcome their FA Cup foes.",
    "fullText": "Having played, rather infamously, in 1974 and then as recently as 2014, Sunderland and Carlisle United are no strangers to FA Cup meet ups. The clubs were even drawn against each other for two years running in 1994 and 1995, with both ties having to be settled via replays at Brunton Park – the first instance of which took place on this day.\n\nA hard-fought draw earlier in the month On This Day (8 January 1994): Buxton’s Boys look to avenge Stokoe’s Stars | Roker Report meant the sides had to do it all again in Cumbria, where heavy rain and a rapid frost thaw had left the pitch in a less than ideal condition. Nevertheless, referee Roger Dilkes was happy for the match to start having carried out an inspection earlier in the day, although the arrival of strong winds come kick-off did make the already difficult conditions even more tricky to cope with.\n\nThe weather proved to be a factor in not only the game itself, but Mick Buxton’s team selection also; young forward Craig Russell had picked up a knock at the weekend during Sunderland’s game against Middlesbrough, and having taken the playing surface into consideration the manager felt that Lee Howey’s more physical approach would be better suited. Howey was on a high anyway having scored the header that had settled the Wear Tees clash, and with Don Goodman and Gordon Armstrong already sidelined through injury the last thing the squad needed was to lose Russell for a period by forcing him into a prolonged slog on a mud bath.\n\nRussell was instead brought on to see out Sunderland’s passage into the next round having just seen them take the lead, although it had been a long time coming admittedly. Despite Carlisle’s Division Three status they dominated the first half, and having already given the Lads a scare on Wearside they looked a decent bet going into the break. Simon Davey and David Reeves both looked dangerous, whilst Rod Thomas was also a threat, but they were unable to find a breakthrough and as time marched on the visitors came on strong.\n\nSince Buxton had replaced Terry Butcher in November Sunderland had only lost twice, and their new found resilience meant the Blues eventually ran out of steam before being forced to sit back. A quality move involving Gary Owers, Richard Ord and Phil Gray led to a period of pressure after an hour and ten minutes later Gray came within a fraction of scoring having been put through by Brian Atkinson. Still, it needed extra time before the crucial goal, with Howey sweeping an Ord knockdown from a Martin Smith corner into the net to send the away support behind the goal wild.\n\nThe 4,000 or so travelling fans made up around a third of the total attendance, and a number of them ended up on the pitch amidst the celebrations. His decision to pick Howey vindicated, Buxton brought Russell on shortly after the action had recommenced – meaning that the ‘Jarra Arra’ could now run at a tired defence in the closing stages and look to keep possession well away from his own goal. The tactic worked a treat and whilst it might have been a grind at times it was enough to give Sunderland their first FA Cup victory over Carlisle, who 20 years earlier had been the ones to bring their defence of the trophy to an abrupt end.\n\nSunderland: Chamberlain; Owers, Bennett, Melville, Ord; Atkinson (Russell 106’), Ferguson, Ball, Smith; Howey, P. Gray Unused: Norman, Ma. Gray\n\nBrunton Park, attendance 12 771",

    "fullText": "Juventus have reportedly joined their rivals Roma in the race for Manchester United striker Joshua Zirkzee, who could genuinely leave the club this month.\n\nThe Dutchman has been struggling for minutes since the start of the season. Following the arrivals of summer signings Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, and Benjamin Sesko, he found himself at the bottom of Ruben Amorim’s attacking pecking order, only earning a starting role when some of his teammates were missing due to injuries.\n\nThe former Bologna star was hoping to make a good first impression on the new Man Utd boss, Michael Carrick, but he wasn’t even in the matchday squad for the Derby victory over Man City.\n\nESPN journalist Rob Dawson revealed that the striker’s absence is due to a knock he received in training earlier this week.\n\nIn addition to providing updates on the player’s condition, Dawson also revealed that the Netherlands international could still end up leaving Man Utd before the end of January. This was also echoed by Dutch journalist Joost Blaauwhof.\n\n“Joshua Zirkzee is missing from the Manchester derby due to injury,” he posted on his X account.\n\n“The striker is sidelined for a short period and could already have played his last match at Old Trafford if action in Italy picks up soon. The possibility of that is considerable. The Manchester United striker is reportedly keen on joining AS Roma.”\n\n(Photo by Michael Regan/Getty Images)\n\nZirkzee’s possible move to Roma has been well-documented over the past few months, as the Italian capital side has been keen to add him to Gian Piero Gasperini’s ranks.\n\nBut according to Sky Sport Italia journalist Gianluca Di Marzio, the Giallorossi could have company in the race, as Juventus are also considering a move.\n\nThe transfer market insider insists that the Turin-based giants are determined to sign Crystal Palace bomber Jean-Philippe Mateta, who has also been on Man Utd’s shortlist, but they have identified Zirkzee as a fallback option.\n\nIt should be noted that Carrick decided to drop Sesko from the starting lineup on his debut, which could spell further bad news for the already-frustrated Zirkzee.\n\nThe English head coach is seemingly in favour of fielding Mbeumo in the No.9 role to make room for Amad Diallo on the right wing. The Cameroonian responded well to the change, scoring the all-important opener against Man City.\n\nIf this trend continues, Zirkzee might find himself third in line for the striker role in a season where United hardly need extra depth due to the lack of commitments. Therefore, the Dutchman might soon be marked as surplus to requirements, opening the door for a return to Italy.",

    "description": "The Lakers were very short-handed on Saturday versus the Trail Blazers, and they ended up losing again by a wide margin.",
    "fullText": "The day before the Los Angeles Lakers' Saturday matchup against the Portland Trail Blazers, Luka Doncic was ruled out due to groin soreness. Prior to the opening tip of that game, they got more bad news when it was revealed that starting center Deandre Ayton and backup center Jaxson Hayes also wouldn't play.\n\nWith Austin Reaves still sidelined due to a gastrocnemius strain, the Lakers were in a very difficult situation against a Portland team that had won eight of its last 11 games.\n\nLos Angeles was competitive early, but a 15-2 Trail Blazers run put them up 40-27 at the end of the first quarter. They shot a whopping 22 free throws in the first quarter, and in general, that first period set the tone for the entire evening.\n\nThe Lakers were never able to mount a serious challenge, as they ended up losing, 132-116. It was their fifth loss in their last six games and their 12th loss in their last 21 contests, as well as the second game in a row they gave up over 130 points.\n\nThey simply got outclassed in almost every category. They let Portland shoot 52.3% from the field and 38.1% from 3-point range, and they got outrebounded by 15 while giving up 27 second-chance points. It's becoming a broken record for the Lakers — they continue to put up a weak level of resistance defensively while often getting outplayed in the effort categories.\n\nThey now have a 24-16 record and remain in sixth place in the Western Conference, and they're just half a game ahead of the seventh-place Phoenix Suns.\n\nSmart did plenty to give the Lakers a chance to win this game, at least offensively. He took 17 shot attempts, which was a new season high for him, and made nine of them while going 4-of-6 from 3-point range, giving him a team-high 25 points. He also had two rebounds and one steal, but he had no assists in 25 minutes.\n\nThe Lakers needed an all-hands-on-deck effort, especially offensively, in this game, but LaRavia didn't pull his weight. He got off only two shot attempts and missed both of them, and he scored just two points on free throws. In 28 minutes, he contributed five rebounds, four assists and one steal.\n\nKleber has barely scored or even looked to score this season, but early on, he was aggressive offensively. He scored nine points in the first quarter and ended up with 11 points on 4-of-8 field-goal shooting, and he also had five rebounds, one assist and one steal in 21 minutes.\n\nVincent wasn't able to give L.A. much, if anything, on offense. He missed all but one of his six shot attempts and ended up with three points and one assist in 23 minutes.\n\nJames was 1-of-7 in the first quarter and 3-of-12 in the first half, and while he shot somewhat better afterward, he never truly got it going. He finished with 20 points on 6-of-16 shooting from the field, although he did make all seven of his free throw attempts. James did help out with nine rebounds, eight assists, two blocks and one steal.\n\nHachimura made a nice offensive contribution off the bench in 19 minutes. He made four of his seven shot attempts to score 11 points, to go along with one rebound, one assist and two steals.\n\nIn 18 minutes, Vanderbilt made all three of his shots to score six points and added two rebounds, one assist and one block.\n\nTimme, a 6-foot-10 power forward who is on a two-way contract, had a fantastic outing and made the most of his 29 minutes of playing time. He shot 9-of-12 overall and 3-of-4 from downtown, giving him 21 points, and he mixed it up well by scoring deep in the paint and also hitting from the perimeter. He also had four assists, two rebounds and two steals.\n\nAt times, Bufkin hustled well on defense, resulting in two blocks, and on the other end of the floor, he made three of his eight shot attempts, giving him nine points in 22 minutes. He also chipped in one rebound and one assist.\n\nSmith got 10 minutes of playing time on Saturday and finished with five points on 2-of-3 shooting and three assists.\n\nKnecht played five minutes and hit a 3-pointer, while the younger James got eight minutes on the court and missed both of his shot attempts while notching one assist.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Lakers player grades: L.A. loses big in Portland while short-handed",

    "description": "What stood out the most for Seattle?",
    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks dismantled the San Francisco 49ers in literally every phase of the game. In fact, this was tied for their most dominant playoff victory of all time, right alongside Super Bowl XLVIII.\n\nSeattle began the game with a bang, thanks to Rashid Shaheed's 95-yard kick return touchdown. From there, they never let their foot of the pedal for the remainder of the contest. The Seahawks ended San Francisco's season, and now they get to host the NFC Championship for the fourth time ever... and the first since the 2014 season. As always, we at Seahawks Wire take you through the top takeaways from each game, and we aren't slowing down now!\n\nOne game is one thing. Two is another. Three, and now four, is officially a pattern. Saturday night marked the fourth-straight game the Seahawks have rushed for at 160+ yards as a team. Against the 49ers, Seattle bulldozed their way to 175 on 33 carries. Leading the way was Kenneth Walker III, who had 116 of those yards and all three rushing touchdowns from the night. Backup Zach Charbonnet did leave the game with an injury and was unable to return, but head coach Mike Macdonald seemed optimistic about initial results.\n\nSam Darnold has been battling negative bias from the media and opposing fans all season long. This stems from how poorly he played in the Vikings' last two games to conclude the 2024 campaign - blowout losses in Week 18 and the Wild Card. Darnold proved doubters wrong with wins over the Rams and Niners to close out the 2025 season, but doubts persisted, especially with his sudden oblique issue landing him on the injury report. Darnold was totally solid on Saturday. He may not have blown anyone away, but with how this team is playing, completing 12-of-17 passes for 124 yards and a touchdown (a spectacular one at that!) is more than enough to keep the Seahawks competitive. Darnold will most assuredly continue to face these questions, although there may be less of them going into the NFC Championship.\n\nKupp has not been utilized this year like he had been throughout his time with the LA Rams. An outsider who does not watch Seahawks games each week might even be forgiven for thinking he's not much of an impact player anymore. However, for those who do, know what Kupp brings to the Seahawks. Against the 49ers, the Eastern Washington native reminded everyone he is a veteran with plenty of playoff experience. Kupp led Seattle with 60 yards on five receptions and gave the offense a presense at wide receiver opposite Jaxon Smith-Njigba the team needed.\n\nAs I mentioned in the introduction, the Seahawks are going to be playing in their fourth ever NFC Championship game. The three previous ones have all taken place at Qwest/CenturyLink/Lumen Field, and now a fourth will join the trio. Of course, I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't mention the Seahawks proved to be 3-0 in all of those NFC title games. Whoever emerges from the Rams/Bears game on Sunday will likely be considered a slim underdog at Lumen Field next week, and understandably so.\n\nIt's absurd he has never won this award yet. Think about what John Schneider brought to the Seahawks this year: Sam Darnold, Cooper Kupp, and DeMarcus Lawrence - who forced yet another fumble on Saturday night. Keep in mind Darnold and Kupp were replacements for Geno Smith and DK Metcalf. Not to mention the draft pick they received from Metcalf eventually became Nick Emmanwori, who recovered said fumble from Lawrence. Oh, let's not forget the Seahawks acquired Rashid Shaheed at the deadline. Getting a receiver was no on one's radar, but Schneider identified a way to elevate his team, and Shaheed has rewarded his faith with three return touchdowns in seven games. An absolute game changer. Also, even though they weren't this year, two other trade deadline acquisitions in the form of Leonard Williams and Ernest Jones IV were All-Pro players this year. Lastly, two of his previous first round picks from 2023, Devon Witherspoon and Jaxon Smith-Njigba, both made the Pro Bowl, and JSN was even first team All-Pro. There is simply no one else more deserving of the award, and the blowout win over San Francisco was seeing his mastery all pay off in one game.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Seahawks Wire: Seahawks vs 49ers: Top Seattle takeaways from Divisional Round",

    "description": "The French-born Fery, who is the son of a former tennis player and the president of football club Lorient, stunned an ill Flavio Cobolli on his main draw debut",
    "fullText": "Great Britain’s Arthur Fery claimed the first upset of the Australian Open as the qualifier knocked out 20th seed Flavio Cobolli in the first round.\n\nThe 23-year-old Fery, making his overseas grand slam debut, won 7-6 (1), 6-4, 6-1 to take out the rising star Cobolli, who took a medical timeout and was visited by the doctor as he struggled with a stomach bug.\n\nFery won his first-round match at last year’s Wimbledon, also beating the 20th seed in Australia’s Alexei Popyrin, after receiving a wildcard into the tournament.\n\nThis time, Fery has now scored four victories so far in Melbourne, having come through from the first round of qualifying, and will now take on Argentina’s Tomas Martín Etcheverry in the second round.\n\n“It seems I like drawing 20th seeds at grand slams,” Fery laughed afterwards during his on-court interview. “I felt great. I felt very comfortable on that court. Obviously playing three matches beforehand in quallies really helped.”\n\nRanked 186th in the world, Fery was born in France and his mother, Olivia Fery, was a professional tennis player. His father, Loic Fery, is a businessman and president of French top-flight football club FC Lorient.\n\n“It definitely really helped when I was younger in my development to have two parents who know how pro-sport works and the pressures of it,” said Fery, who is also fluent in French due to his parents.\n\n“Keeping a good balance between trying to develop tennis but also having a life and having an education and keeping your kid balanced when he is young. It’s very important. I'm very lucky for that.”\n\nHe went to school at King College in Wimbledon before enrolling at Stanford University in the United States on a tennis scholarship, a route also taken by the British No 2 Cameron Norrie and No 3 Jacob Fearnley (both Texas Christian University) in recent years.\n\nFery played for three years at Stanford, between 2020 and 2023, while also studying for a degree in science and technology, and became the No 1 ranked singles player in the college system during his second year.\n\n“It was a good experience. It's very different to going pro straightaway,” Fery said. “I think I wasn't quite ready for the pro tour at 18 when I came out of juniors.\n\n“I wasn't ready to travel 35, 40 weeks a year. So college was a great experience. You obviously get a world-class education at Stanford. At the same time you can play loads of matches, develop as a player.\n\n“You are left to your own a little bit more than if you have a travelling coach all the time with you. It's character-building for sure. I was lucky, very lucky, to be around great people and great coaches.\n\n“It's very individual. Some guys are ready to go all guns blazing 35 weeks a year travelling with a coach, or without. That's their identity. They are a tennis player from 18.\n\n“I was still in normal school until 16. I did A-levels, home school at home playing juniors. Tennis wasn't my life at 18. Now I feel like it is. It's my job.”\n\nFery made two appearances in the main draw at Wimbledon, his home tournament, before earning his first win over Popyrin at last year’s Championships. He lost to Luciano Darderi in the second round.\n\nBut Fery also took a step forwards in his career in September when he replaced the British No 1 Jack Draper and the injured Fearnley in Great Britain’s Davis Cup tie against Poland, beating Olaf Pieczkowski 6-4 6-2 in Gdynia.\n\nAlong with his first title on the Challenger circuit, Fery entered the 2026 season with a career-high ranking of 185 in the world - although he is already set to gain more than 50 places after beating Cobolli in the first round of the Australian Open.\n\nThe French-born Fery also said it was “satisfying” to produce a big result at the grand slams away from Wimbledon, where British players can receive wildcards and have the backing of the home crowds.\n\n“Obviously when you see the draw, you play a seed, you know you need your best tennis to get through. Maybe it was a good thing for me as well to know that I had to really play well and bring my best tennis today to have a chance. I thought I did that. I felt really at that level.\n\n“I was already happy to qualify here for my first time in the quallies of a slam on my own. Now coming through quallies and winning a round, I'm proud of it. I was hoping that at some point I was going to be able to play other slams without needing wildcards. So that's a good step forward for my career for sure.”\n\nAfter qualifying for the main draw, Fery’s mum flew out to Australia just in time for his match against Cobolli.\n\n“When I won that last round, she asked me if she could come,” Fery said. “It's obviously it's a long way, but at least I made it worth it. She can see at least two matches - hopefully more.”\n\nArgentina’s Etcheverry, who has a career-high ranking of 27 and beat Andy Murray on his final-ever match at the Australian Open.\n\nEtcheverry battled past Miomir Kecmanovic in five sets and Fery said: “He's been on tour for a while, so I know him. I've seen some matches, but not too much. I guess we'll speak about it with my coach and come with a good game plan.”",

(AP) — Mikael Granlund scored at 4:02 of overtime, and the Anaheim Ducks beat the Los Angeles Kings 2-1 on Saturday night to sweep a two-game weekend set in the Freeway Faceoff rivalry.\n\nRookie Beckett Sennecke created the winning score by swooping in on a backcheck to take the puck away from Los Angeles' Kevin Fiala on a breakaway. Sennecke knocked the puck straight to Granlund, who beat Anton Forsberg for his ninth goal of the season.\n\nMason McTavish scored the first goal and Ville Husso made 17 saves for the Ducks. They have won three straight after a nine-game skid.\n\nAdrian Kempe scored a power-play goal and Forsberg stopped 30 shots in the backup's strong performance for the Kings, who have lost six of seven.\n\nSennecke played a major role for the second straight night when the Southern California clubs completed their back-to-back set by going to overtime for the third time in their four meetings this season. Sennecke had two assists and scored in the shootout as the Ducks rallied from a two-goal deficit for a 3-2 victory over the Kings in downtown Los Angeles on Friday night.\n\nMcTavish ended the Ducks' victory in LA with his fourth shootout goal of the season, and he opened the scoring in the rematch with a wrist shot for his 12th goal early in the first period.\n\nKempe tied it in the second period, scoring his 16th goal on a hard one-timer off a pass from Fiala. Kempe then put a gloved finger to his lips, shushing the sixth consecutive sellout crowd in Anaheim.\n\nLos Angeles had six power plays before the Ducks got their first man-advantage late in the second period, yet Anaheim had a significant edge in shots after carrying play for long stretches at even strength.\n\nAfter a scoreless third, the Kings played into extra time for a league-high 20th time this season.\n\nJeffrey Viel made his debut for the Ducks, who traded a fourth-round pick to Boston on Friday to get the veteran forward who hasn't scored in the NHL since March 18, 2022. The 6-foot-1 Viel fought 6-foot-6 Kings forward Samuel Helenius in the first period.\n\nKings: Host the New York Rangers on Tuesday night.\n\nDucks: Host the Rangers on Monday night.",

Hobbling to the locker room, his injury clouded the Oklahoma City Thunder for the rest of the way in their 122-120 loss to the Miami Heat.\n\nWilliams sustained the injury in the second quarter. Ajay Mitchell started the second half in his place. Eventually, the Thunder ruled him out for the remainder of the game due to right thigh soreness.\n\nThunder head coach Mark Daigneault said afterward they'll know \n\nOver the last handful of games, Williams has played his best basketball of the season. He's continued to work back from his surgically-repaired wrist. Now, you hope he doesn't miss too much time with his injury.\n\nIf so, that obviously is a bummer for the Thunder.

    "fullText": "Chelsea are reportedly interested in signing an Ivory Coast winger who has 3 goals in 9 games for his country so far.\n\nIt’s actually his only 9 games he’s had for Ivory Coast so far, having come up through the youth teams of his national side first.\n\nChelsea are mostly being linked with new centre backs right now for this transfer window, but we are hearing a lot about other positions being targeted in the summer probably, as well as any potential more opportunities arising this window.\n\nJanuary is a long month so they have plenty of time still to get some deals done, but this story is more than likely going to be one for the summer, of they do decide to make an attempt to try and sign him\n\nYan Diomande playing for RB Leipzig. (Photo by Stuart Franklin/Getty Images)\n\nAccording to Sky Germany, Chelsea among top clubs interested in RB Leipzig’s winger Yan Diomande.\n\nThe 19-year-old left winger has only been at Leipzig since the summer but already there are talks of the big clubs coming in for him – Chelsea being one of them.\n\nWe’ll see if anything goes any further on this one, but it’s clear that if this is a transfer that is going to happen then it will be for the summer of 2026 rather than this window now.\n\nObviously we had a game on yesterday with Chelsea beating Brentford 2-0 at Stamford Bridge in their latest Premier League match. It was a needed win, but it might have come at the cost of another injury to a defender, with Liam Rosenior putting the latest out on that after the game yesterday afternoon.\n\nCole Palmer’s poor recent form continued yesterday, but Rosenior has defended his attacking midfielder in the media and denied any suggestion of poor form.",

    "description": "Brabec misses winning by 2 seconds, Ford Raptors get lost, but American Polaris team wins again",
    "fullText": "A series of unfortunate events wound up costing American Honda rider Ricky Brabec the win in the motorcycle class of the 2026 Dakar rally, a race held for the seventh year in Saudi Arabia.\n\nAfter two weeks of racing over countless miles of sand and rocks, Argentine Luciano Benavides, riding a KTM, edged out American Ricky Brabec’s Honda by two seconds, the narrowest margin in the history of the event.\n\nIt was just the final cruel twist of fate Dakar had to deal out.\n\n“I have no idea why we lost, it makes no sense to me,” said two-time winner Brabec at the finish line, after he had congratulated Benavides.\n\nAh, but we have an idea. Several.\n\nFirst was camels. Brabec came upon a herd he estimated at 50-strong way out in a rocky section of that day’s stage. He couldn’t go around them because of the big rocks on either side of the dirt road, he couldn’t go through them because camels are really big, and he couldn’t even honk a horn because race bikes don’t have horns.\n\n“The camels were freakin’ in the road and I couldn’t go around them. I was like, ‘Damn, I don’t know what to do. I’m losing time right here.’ There were probably, like, 50 camels, right? So I’m like, ‘Dude I can’t go around, there’s, like, big black boulder rocks just everywhere,’ and I was like, ‘If I go out and try to risk going around the camels I’m gonna make it (the motorcycle) tip over, maybe smash something, twist an ankle or just something so stupid,’ so I just sat behind ‘em and I tried to get as close as I can and maybe they would shoo and go anywhere in the rocks. But yeah I was kinda bummed about this situation.”\n\nThen, on another day’s stage, Brabec stopped again, this time to help a fallen competitor. Australian KTM rider Daniel Sanders crashed 138 kilometers into the second half of Wednesday's marathon stage from Wadi ad Dawasir to Bisha, breaking his collarbone and sternum, according to abc.au.\n\n“I came over the dune and Tosh (Spanish Honda rider Tosha Schareina) came over the dune, and he (Sanders) was just kind of under his bike, stuck,” Brabec said. “So me and Tosh stopped. Tosh stopped at the top of the dune to make sure no one was coming to jump and land on him. Then I was down in the dune helping Daniel.”\n\nHe got that sorted out but, in the process, lost the lead. Sanders, being a tough Australian, got back on his bike… and finished the stage.\n\nNor did Brabec. He regained the lead in the following days and, until, just two kliks from the finish line, when he was in the lead by over three minutes and had only to cruise his Monster Energy Honda to the inflatable Red Bull arch and take his third Dakar win, something happened.\n\n“I navigated well all day,” Brabec said. “One route note, right here, two kilometers from the finish, I don’t know. I took the wrong left. The route book showed one left, so I took the left. It put me in a bad situation, and here we are.”\n\nOn the four-wheeled side of Dakar, meanwhile, it was a Dacia that won. Dacias are one of the cheapest cars you can buy in Europe, and the one you give a big sigh over when they assign it to you at the car rental counter at Charles de Gaulle. The somewhat diminutive Dacia Sandrider prototype looked like a little bug, but won it all over the mighty 2026 Ford Raptor T1 Ultimate Dakar Rally car and the equally mighty (and last year’s winner) Toyota Hilux.\n\nIt helped that it was driven by Qatari driver Nasser Al Attiyah, who had already won Dakar five times, this year making six.\n\nFord showed up at Dakar with four factory entries, while an additional four privateers also drove Raptors. It was the first year Ford came as an official factory team.\n\nThe trucks, too, had been upgraded.\n\n“The Ford Raptor T1+ itself represents the most complete expression yet of what we’ve learned through years of desert racing,” Ford said before the race. “It is lighter, more aerodynamically efficient, delivers dramatically improved visibility and control, and incorporates meaningful gains in suspension performance, cockpit access, and overall durability.”\n\nIn the early stages, Ford was doing well, swapping wins with Toyota’s Hilux trucks. But both Ford and Toyota didn’t show enough wins to last at the top of the leaderboard, and all the time Al Attiyah was moving up. While he won Stage 2, by his Stage 6 win, he seemed in strong contention to win it all. And despite Ford winning five stages and the prologue, navigation errors by Ford drivers, and smoother running by Al Attiyah throughout, meant the Qatari driver was the winner.\n\nIn SxS competition, as in Baja, it was American Brock Heger in the Loeb Fraymedia Motorsport Polaris RZR Factory Racing entry that claimed his second Dakar win in the class, after doing the same dominating dance in SCORE desert racing in Baja.\n\nIn the Stock class it was Defender Rally in its debut year, as drivers Rokas Baciuška and Oriol Vidal win in the Defender Dakar D7X‑R. Teammates Sara Price and Sean Berriman finished in second place, while ‘Mr Dakar’ Stéphane Peterhansel and co‑driver Mika Metge finished in fourth position in the Dakar Rally Stock class rankings.\n\n“Dakar Rally was just incredible,” said Price. “We had a goal at the final stage to get to the finish line as a team together. So to see the whole Defender team sitting there at the finish line and all their excitement and emotions, it just shows what this is all about and what it means. To get this team to the finish line in P1 and P2 is just, wow, incredible.”\n\nAs was the whole two-week adventure. If you can’t get enough of this off-road stuff, the SCORE King Shocks San Felipe 250 starts March 25-29 in Baja. But that’s an entirely different kind of racing.",

    "description": "Get out of the way or you’re going to get run over by the Seahawks!",
    "fullText": "That was supremely satisfying. Mike Macdonald loves his rallying cries, whether it’s “12 as one”, “Chasing Edges,” or “E.A.T.”. I’ve got another one for the Seattle Seahawks after that 41-6 dismantling of the San Francisco 49ers in the Division Round – Professional Destruction.\n\nThose two words embody Macdonald’s vision for the team and perfectly encapsulate the way Seattle has been playing for the last two months. ‘The Dark Side” defense has been utterly suffocating opposing offenses while the running game has been on a roll. For weeks I’ve been trying to find different ways to describe the dominance the Seahawks have been showcasing, particularly on the defensive side. The way Ken Walker is running behind this nasty offensive line, the offense also fully deserves the Professional Destruction moniker.\n\nKen Walker III is really damn good…historically good for the Seahawks playoffs actually.\n\n@Seahawks RB Kenneth Walker III tied the postseason franchise record with three rushing touchdowns. #GoHawks\n\n— Seahawks PR (@seahawksPR) January 18, 2026\n\nThe offensive line was giving him good creases and Walker was hitting the hole with burst. He also had some fantastic cutbacks and broke tackles on the way. Maybe the most emblematic run of how the Seahawks are playing right now was the one in the fourth quarter where he ran into a crowd and got pushed about five yards farther when the rest of the team got in on the action. The Seahawks are physically imposing their will on the opponents. I would take his stat line of 19 carries for 116 yards and 3 TDs any day.\n\nErnest Jones IV is really damn good. He singlehandedly caused two turnovers today, stripping the ball from Jake Tonges on Seattle’s second defensive drive and picked off Brock Purdy later in the game. He’s a tackling machine and is the leader in the middle of the defense getting everyone lined up. Picking up Jones in a trade last season is one of the best trades John Schneider has made as GM of the Seahawks.\n\nRashid Shaheed is really damn good. Speaking of great trades by John Schneider, the Shaheed trade is the gift that keeps on giving. His opening kickoff return for a TD was literally the game-winner, and was his third return TD since joining the Seahawks at the trade deadline. Shaheed also had a huge run on an end-around and drew a pass interference penalty. With Tory Horton’s injury, adding Shaheed has been a massive key to the Seahawks success this season.\n\nDeMarcus Lawrence is really damn good. He got to Brock Purdy on his first throw of the game, nearly forcing a fumble. Later, he blew up a fourth down play. Even later, he strip-sacked Purdy and the ball was recovered by Nick Emmanwori. Tank came to the Seahawks because he thought they had a chance to win the Super Bowl. He’s doing his best to make that a reality.\n\nPlayoff Cooper Kupp is awesome. His stat line of 5 catches for 60 yards might not be the most impressive, but all of them seemed to come at crucial times. Kupp was the reliable safety blanket that everyone hoped he would be after signing with his hometown team.\n\nThe tight ends didn’t have any catches today, but they all blocked their asses off. AJ Barner and Eric Saubert were both throwing key blocks on the outside runs that Walker was so effective with against the 49ers. That kind of selfless play is why those guys are beloved.\n\nIt was good to see Charles Cross and Coby Bryant back out there. Bryant finished the game, unlike Cross, but hopefully it was just precautionary with Charles. Zach Charbonnet was injured as well, but the initial prognosis was somewhat hopeful. He’s a huge part of the third down packages and a touchdown machine, so having him miss time would hurt the offense.\n\nThe offensive line blocked really well again today as evidenced by the 175 yards rushing, the fourth week in a row that Seattle ran for 150+ yards. At this point, I don’t think it’s a fluke. No better time for the run game to come alive than at the most important time of the season!\n\nSeattle will host the NFC Championship game for the first time in over a decade and got damn does it feel good! Whether it’s the third matchup with the Los Angeles Rams or a showdown with the No. 2 seed Chicago Bears, it’s sure to be a wild atmosphere. Until then, enjoy this one folks. This is a special, special team!",

    "title": "What were books like in ancient Greece and Rome?",
    "description": "Ancient bookstore were surprisingly modern.",
    "fullText": "This article originally appeared in The Conversation.\n\nIf you were to visit a bookshop in the ancient world, what would it be like?\n\nYou don’t just have to imagine it. The ancient Roman writer Aulus Gellius, who lived in the 2nd century CE, gives us a number of descriptions of his adventures at bookstores. In one passage, he describes an encounter at one in Rome, which he was visiting with a poet friend:\n\nI chanced to be sitting in a bookshop in the Sigillaria with the poet Julius Paulus […] There was on sale there the Annals of Quintus Fabius Pictor in a copy of good and undoubted age, which the dealer maintained was without errors.\n\nGellius then tells us that, while they are sitting there, another customer enters the shop. The new customer has a disagreement with the dealer. He complains that he “found in the book one error”. The dealer says that’s impossible. Then the customer brings out evidence to prove the dealer wrong.\n\nIn different passage, Aulus tells us about some bookstalls he came across when he arrived by ship at the port of Brundisium on the Adriatic coast. The books, he records, were “in Greek, filled with marvellous tales, things unheard of, incredible […] The writers were ancient and of no mean authority”.\n\nThe volumes themselves, however, were filthy from neglect, in bad condition and unsightly. Nevertheless, I drew near and asked their price; then, attracted by their extraordinary and unexpected cheapness, I bought a large number of them for a small sum.\n\nAulus goes on to describe in excited language all the weird facts he derived from these books – like how people in Africa can “work spells by voice and tongue” and through this witchcraft cause people, animals, trees and crops to die.\n\nThese sorts of stories bring us close to how ordinary people in ancient Greek and Roman times obtained books and engaged with books. But if we read stories like this it might lead us to want to know more. How did books and writing come into existence? And how were books written and produced?\n\nMany people in the ancient world thought that writing had been invented by gods or heroes. For example, the ancient Egyptians believed the god Thoth was the first to create signs to represent spoken sounds.\n\nThe origins of writing are certainly mysterious. It’s unclear when writing began and who invented it.\n\nThe earliest written text is a wooden tablet radiocarbon dated to before 5000 BCE. This is known as the Dispilio tablet, because it was discovered at a neolithic lakeside settlement at Dispilio in Greece. It is carved with strange linear markings. These have not been deciphered, but most scholars think they are a form of writing.\n\nEvidence for writing appears early in different parts of the world. In Mesopotamia and Egypt, the oldest texts, such as the Kish limestone tablet at Uruk or the Narmer Palette at Hierakonpolis, date to before 3000 BCE. In the Indus Valley, the Harappan script, which remains undeciphered, appeared around the same time. In China, the earliest characters, the Dawenkou graphs, also date to around 3000 BCE.\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of early writing is that there is such a variety of different scripts. For example, the earliest known texts in the Greek language are written in the Linear B script, which was used from around 1500-1200 BCE, and wasn’t deciphered until 1952. Linear B is not an alphabet, but a syllabary of more than 80 different signs. A syllabary is a kind of writing system where each sign represents a syllable.\n\nOur English alphabet comes from the Romans, who in the 8th and 7th century BCE also got their alphabet from the Phoenicians, via the Greeks.\n\nPeople in ancient times used many different things as writing materials.\n\nThe Roman writer Pliny the Elder (23-79 CE) tells us that the earliest people in the world\n\nused to write on palm-leaves and then on the bark of certain trees, and afterwards folding sheets of lead began to be employed for official muniments, and then also sheets of linen or tablets of wax for private documents.\n\nHowever, the most popular writing material in the ancient Mediterranean was papyrus, from which we get our word “paper”.\n\nTo make papyrus, you get the pith of the papyrus plant (Cyperus papyrus), cut it into slender strips, then press it together. Once dried, it forms a thin sheet that you can write on.\n\nPapyrus sheets were usually glued together into rolls. These rolls could be very long. Some of the most lavish Egyptian papyrus rolls were more than 10 metres long, such as the recently discovered Waziri Papyrus containing parts of the Book of the Dead.\n\nWhen papyri were rolled up they were stored in shelves or boxes. Labels were attached to the handles of the papyri so you could identify their contents. In his play Linus, Greek playwright Alexis (c. 375-275 BC) has one character tell another how to look through a bunch of rolls to find what he wants:\n\ngo over and pick any papyrus roll you like out of there and then read it… examining them quietly, and at your leisure, on the basis of the labels. Orpheus is in there, Hesiod, tragedies, Choerilus, Homer, Epicharmus, prose treatises of every type…\n\nPapyrus seems flimsy to the eye, but it is a durable writing material, stronger than modern paper. Many papyri have survived for thousands of years stored in jars or sarcophagi or buried under the sand.\n\nThe oldest surviving papyrus text is the so-called Diary of Merer (which you can listen to here), the logbook of a man named Merer, who was an inspector during the construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza under Pharaoh Khufu. This papyrus, which dates to around 2600 BCE, gives a day-by-day account of how Merer and his team of about 200 men spent time hauling and transporting stone and doing other work.\n\nPapyrus was susceptible to being eaten by insects or mice. But there were ways to prevent this. Pliny the Elder, for example, advises that sheets of papyrus soaked in citrus-oil won’t be eaten by moths.\n\nIf you were living in ancient Greece or Rome and wanted to write a book, how would you do it?\n\nFirst, you would buy sheets or rolls of papyrus to write on. If you couldn’t afford it, you’d have to write on the back or in the margins of papyri you already owned.\n\nIf you didn’t own any papyri already, then you would have to write on other materials. According to the Greek historian Diogenes Laertius (3rd century CE), the philosopher Cleanthes (c. 331-231 BCE) “wrote down lectures on oyster-shells and the blade-bones of oxen through lack of money to buy papyrus”.\n\nSecond, you would get your ink. In the ancient world, there were many varieties of ink. Normal black ink was made from the soot of burnt resin or pitch mixed with vegetable gum. When buying ink, it would come in powder form, and you would need to mix it with water before using it.\n\nThird, you would get your pen. It would be made from reed, hence it was called the “calamus” by Greeks and Romans (“calamus” is the Greek word for reed). To sharpen your pen you would need a knife. If you made a mistake, you would erase it with a wet sponge.\n\nNow you have all the materials you need. However, you don’t need to use the pen and papyrus yourself. If you want, you can get a scribe to write down your words for you.\n\nThe Greek orator Dio Chrysostom (c.40-110 CE) even advised writers not to use the pen themselves:\n\nWriting I do not advise you to engage in with your own hand, or only very rarely, but rather to dictate to a secretary.\n\nIf you needed to consult other books while writing, you could get friends to send them to you or ask book dealers to make you a copy. In a papyrus from the 2nd century CE found at Oxyrhynchus, Egypt, and written in Greek, the writer asks his friend to find the books that he needs and make copies of them. Otherwise, you would go to a library, though the best libraries at Alexandria, Rome and Athens might be far away.\n\nWhen you finished drafting your book you would need to revise and correct it. You could then publish it by having many copies made by scribes and delivering these copies to friends and booksellers.\n\nWhen all this was done, your book would be out in public. Perhaps someone like Aulus Gellius would stumble across it in a busy Roman bookshop. Maybe he’d even buy it.",

    "fullText": "Call me old-fashioned, but hardly a day goes by where I'm not thinking about the ARPANET.\n\nI mean, c'mon, it's the dang ARPANET - the precursor to today's Internet, basically marking the beginnings of disparate computer systems talking to each other, of people talking to each other through computers, concocted way back in 1969. If you look at what people were doing on the ARPANET almost immediately (and even earlier on similar systems like University of Illinois's PLATO), you'll see that the ARPANET was a harbinger for all the games and e-commerce and apps and whatnot that we rely on every single second of every single day. How can you not be thinking about this stuff all the time?\n\nSince I've already written somewhat of a love-letter to the World Wide Web in our post explaining how Folio connects with suppliers, I'd like to now continue this theme of computer history affection with a dive into one of the earlier protocols from the ARPANET era. It's a protocol that still powers many procurement workflows like order processing, catalog sharing, invoicing, and more.\n\nThat's right, it's the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) - invented in 1971 - along with its more secure, late '90s sibling: SFTP.\n\nAnd, rest assured, we're not just spelunking into these Internet protocols for the sake of it (though there's nothing wrong with that), we're going to be actively giving context for some of the advantages of leveraging Folio's API + web-based lightning integrations for procure-to-pay workflows, while still paying respect to traditional SFTP file drops. Along the way, we're going to code up a few toy examples to understand why SFTP is more secure than FTP, as well as what the heck people mean when they talk about those daily or weekly SFTP \"sweeps\" (and, crucially, why it's hard to figure out if they worked or not!).\n\nIf you're a fellow ARPANET history buff, you're already familiar with RFCs (Request for Comments). For the uninitiated, RFCs are basically the history of the Internet, one technical design doc at a time (see, they're not just for FAANG promo packets). And, guess what, they're all online for anyone to read! I'll prove it - here's the first RFC on FTP - RFC 114.\n\nRFC 114, published in 1971 — eighteen years before the World Wide Web — established FTP as a protocol for transferring files between computers over a network. Many more RFCs were published over time on FTP, honing its implementation as the ARPANET and eventually the Internet evolved into what we know (and sorta love) today.\n\nFTP, as defined in its RFCs, uses a client-server architecture with two separate connections:\n\nControl connection (port 21): Where you send commands like \"list directory\" or \"upload this file\"\n\nData connection (port 20): Where the actual file content flows\n\nFrom these early specifications to the present day with SFTP, the basic file transfer UX of this protocol remains largely the same: a user connects to an server, authenticates with credentials, navigates through directories, and transfers files.\n\nIndeed, so much so that I was using FTP back in the mid '90s without even realizing it.\n\nImagine this scene: you've just hit *save* on the last edit to your personal homepage in Notepad or BBEdit (or let's be honest, Dreamweaver). Your site's got some <marquee> and <blink> tags, a page views hit counter, and definitely an \"Under Construction\" GIF. Probably also this classic:\n\nSo now what? Is your cool website \"on-line\" yet? Nope! Apparently, you need to get this HTML file thing from your family's Gateway 2000 computer onto, quote, your \"web host's server\" (whatever that means…) so your friends can check out your site.\n\nAfter talking to your web hosting provider's support hotline, they send you an email with your FTP credentials:\n\nYou dutifully follow along with the provided instructions, firing up a dedicated FTP client app, plugging in these credentials, and connecting to their server. The FTP client interface shows two panes side by side—your local home computer on the left, and the remote web server on the right.\n\nYou can see folders and files on some server probably thousands of miles away, and you can drag and drop files between your computer and that remote machine.\n\nYou drag index.html from left to right, watch a progress bar fill up, and boom—your website is live. Navigate to http://www.geocities.com/your_username and there's your homepage! You hit refresh a couple dozen times to get that counter up (at least that's what I always did).\n\nBut easy wasn't the problem with FTP. It's that everything in FTP is transmitted in plaintext (aka human-readable, unencrypted text).\n\nEvery time Dreamweaver connected to your GeoCities web server via FTP:\n\nYour welcome123 password flew across the Internet unencrypted\n\nThe contents of the website site (e.g. index.html) transferred unencrypted\n\nSomeone at your ISP, your hosting provider, or anywhere in between could theoretically read everything\n\nFor personal hobby sites, most folks didn't care (or were largely unaware of any issue). But you can imagine how this would be a problem for anything commerce-related (for example, imagine if the file contents were actually meant to be something private, rather than an HTML file for public consumption).\n\nSince we're big fans of procurement at Folio, let's put this issue into procure-to-pay terms.\n\nImagine you're a food supplier for hotels and restaurants. You'd like to share your *EDI 832 Price/Sales Catalog* file with a procurement platform so that your customers can view your products and place purchase orders with you.\n\nEDI (Electronic Data Interchange) is the idea of businesses exchanging structured electronic documents to facilitate workflows that were previously done via paper. Think purchase orders, invoices, catalogs, etc. EDI files are very commonly exchanged via SFTP.\n\nEvery week, you connect to the procurement platform's FTP server to transfer your latest EDI X12 832 catalog file, which contains your customer specific catalog, including special negotiated pricing for each of your items with each of your hotel customers.\n\nIf you were to transmit this file via FTP, then all of your catalog information flows across the Internet in plaintext (aka plain, readable, unencrypted text that anyone could understand). That means that anyone with network access along the path of your transmission could:\n\nCapture your login credentials and access this FTP server\n\nIntercept sensitive business information, including your negotiated pricing and item availability\n\nIt's easy to see how this lack of encryption would be problematic. As commerce and other sensitive workflows like finance gained in popularity on the ARPANET and Internet, it became increasingly obviously that transmitting credentials and business data in plaintext was going to be unacceptable.\n\nLet's try this out ourselves in an educational toy demo to see this security issue with FTP directly.\n\nFor the technically-inclined, I'll assume you're following along on a modern Mac with uv installed (it's a modern Python package / project manager that simplifies a lot of the traditional Python headaches) as well as Homebrew.\n\nIn three separate terminal windows, we're going to:\n\nRun an FTP server locally on our computer\n\nListen to local \"internet\" traffic on our computer using tcpdump\n\nConnect to the local FTP server, as if were planning to transfer a file!\n\nIf all goes well with our demo, we should be able to see the plaintext credentials being sent to the FTP server in terminal #2, demonstrating the plaintext vulnerability with FTP.\n\nIn terminal #1, let's run the pyftpdlib package (a Python FTP server) to start a local FTP server:\n\nIn terminal #2, we can start listening to internet traffic with tcpdump and we'll even filter it down just to look for the FTP credentials.\n\nIn terminal #3, we can now connect to our local FTP server (still running in Terminal #1) with the lftp app (which you'll likely have to first install with Homebrew):\n\nFinally, back in terminal #2, which is still sitting there, listening to internet traffic and searching for the phrase USER or PASS, you should now see the unencrypted username testuser and the unencrypted password testpass123 printed out directly.\n\nUh-oh! It's easy to imagine a real world scenario here — you can see how transmitting these credentials in plaintext makes it easier for someone to gain access to your company's purchase order system. This issue with FTP is clearly not a good situation for serious business applications, like procurement or invoicing workflows.\n\nWhich now brings us to the 1990s, when a new idea emerged for remote computing and file transfers onto the Internet RFC scene: SSH and SFTP.\n\nSFTP stands for SSH File Transfer Protocol (thought it's sometimes incorrectly referred to as Secure File Transfer Protocol). Despite the similarity in names, SFTP is not FTP with encryption attached. Instead, it's an entirely separate protocol designed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as an extension of the SSH (Secure Shell) protocol (first specified in RFC 4250 back in 1995).\n\nSFTP uses a single encrypted connection over port 22 (the same port that SSH uses) to handle both commands and data transfer.\n\nSSH handshake: The client initiates a connection to the server on port 22\n\nAuthentication: The server verifies the client's identity using either username/password, SSH keys, or both\n\nEncrypted tunnel: SSH establishes an encrypted tunnel where all subsequent data flows\n\nSFTP subsystem: Within this secure tunnel, the SFTP protocol handles file operations\n\nPerhaps one of the greatest benefits of this approach is that everything - authentication credentials, file contents, and even directory listings - is encrypted end-to-end. A listener on the network would see nothing but encrypted gibberish. This is why many workflows (in procurement and beyond) use SFTP for transferring files to this day.\n\nImportantly, SFTP isn't just about moving files from one computer to another. You can do quite a bit:\n\nget / put: Download and upload files\n\nls / mkdir: List directories and create folders\n\nrename / rm: Rename and delete files\n\nresume: Resume interrupted transfers (a lifesaver on unreliable connections)\n\nWith these building-blocks, developers have built some really nice UIs for SFTP that feel exactly like using your local computer's file system (I'm thinking of Panic's Transmit app, for one). But you can also stick to the command line if that's your thing!\n\nFor example, in procurement workflows, a typical SFTP interaction might look like this.\n\nWe're first grabbing the latest catalog file with that get command, and then we're dropping in a purchase order for the supplier with the put command. The specific format of these files really depends on what the supplier expects or requires. As mentioned earlier, many procure-to-pay workflows leverage some form of an EDI specification — but these vary quite widely in practice (EDI merits a whole other blog post, to be fair - I'll pencil this in now for the future).\n\nAnyway, in practice (hopefully), no one is really typing in these SFTP commands at 2 AM. That's what computers are for, silly! Here's where automation comes in.\n\nIn procurement SFTP integrations, \"sweeps\" or \"polling\" refers to the automated process of periodically checking a folder for new files. It's the mechanism that keeps EDI and other SFTP procurement workflows humming along without human intervention.\n\nHere's how a typical catalog sweep works:\n\nSupplier maintains an SFTP server with designated folders\n\nHotel's procurement system has credentials to access specific folders on the supplier's SFTP server\n\nA background job is configured by the hotel's procurement system to \"sweep\" the catalog folder every week (or on whichever cadence the supplier updates their catalog).\n\nAt scheduled time (say, 2:00 AM), the procurement system connects via SFTP\n\nIt lists all files in the /outgoing/catalog folder\n\nFor each file, it checks: \"Have I seen this file before?\" likely using some pattern in the filename\n\nNew files are downloaded and processed\n\nOptionally, processed files are moved to an /archive folder or deleted\n\nSystem waits until next scheduled sweep next week\n\nHopefully it's obvious that there's no real-time notification. The supplier's server doesn't \"push\" files to the hotel. The procurement system has to periodically \"ask\" if anything new has arrived. It's like checking your mailbox instead of waiting for a doorbell.\n\nYou'll also see sweeps in the other direction, where a procurement platform drops new purchase orders into a folder on a supplier's SFTP server, and the supplier \"sweeps\" them out every minute or so for order processing. And, hopefully, at that point, it all works, that all the products are available and nothing's out of stock, and the purchase order goes through without a hitch, but we'll get into each of these potential issues in a bit.\n\nFor now, let's try out sweeping ourselves.\n\nLet's set up a local SFTP server using Docker. We'll be able to see exactly how files appear and disappear during sweep operations.\n\nFirst, create a simple configuration file called sftp.json. We'll feed this config into our SFTP server (it sets up our simple username and password, for example).\n\nBecause I'm really nice, here's a one-liner to create that file:\n\nNow we can spin up an SFTP server using the open-source emberstack/sftp Docker image:\n\nGreat, now we should have an SFTP server running on localhost:2222.\n\nLet's connect to our local server:\n\nTry creating a file locally and watching it appear in the SFTP server (this happens via the config setup with Docker).\n\nBack in our SFTP session, let's grab this file.\n\nPretty basic stuff, I suppose. But still cool. We navigated to a directory in an SFTP server and transmitted a file from the SFTP server to our local computer, just like you would in a procurement catalog sweep.\n\nNow let's write some automation!\n\nWe are going to make our own SFTP sweep script.\n\nFirst, let's set up SSH key authentication for our script (which is more secure and automation-friendly than passwords).\n\nWhy SSH keys? SSH key authentication is strongly preferred over passwords for automated systems. Keys can't be accidentally typed incorrectly, they can be rotated without updating credentials in multiple places, and they provide non-repudiation (you know exactly which system made each connection).\n\nThis creates two files: supplier_key (private key) and supplier_key.pub (public key).\n\nWe're using Ed25519 here because it is a modern, elliptic curve-based algorithm that's more secure than traditional RSA keys while using much shorter key lengths (256 bits vs 2048+ bits for RSA).\n\nNow we need to configure our SFTP server to accept this key. To do this, we can update our sftp.json file with this command:\n\nNow we need to copy our public key into the server's authorized keys. First, stop your existing container:\n\nIf you've connected to localhost:2222 before (perhaps from earlier in this tutorial), you'll want to clean up the old host key to avoid SSH warnings:\n\nCreate the SSH directory structure and copy your public key:\n\nRestart the SFTP server with the updated configuration:\n\nNow create a file called sweep.sh with these contents:\n\nThe -i ./supplier_key flag tells SFTP to use our private key for authentication instead of prompting for a password. This is exactly how automated procurement systems authenticate—no human interaction required!\n\nRun this script and watch as it periodically checks for new CSV files. Drop some CSV files into sftp-data/outgoing/ and watch them get picked up on the next sweep and downloaded into your downloads folder.\n\nAre you now a procurement platform? Are you now a supplier platform? Probably not, but this is still pretty cool.\n\nAs we've just seen, SFTP sweeps work reliably for what they're designed to do: batch file transfers on a schedule. But they introduce fundamental limitations that can impact modern, real-time procure-to-pay workflows.\n\nWhen you submit a purchase order via SFTP, here's what typically happens:\n\nYour procurement system uploads PO-12345.xml to the supplier's /incoming/orders folder\n\nEventually (1 minute? 30 minutes? 2 hours? Next business day?) the supplier platform sweeps the SFTP folder and processes the batch\n\nThey drop PO-12345-confirmation.xml in their /outgoing/orders folder\n\nYou finally learn if the order was accepted or if there were errors from out of stock items, etc.\n\nCompare this to a modern API where you'd get an immediate response:\n\nLet's say you submit an order with an invalid product SKU. With SFTP:\n\nOrder uploads successfully (file transfer succeeded)\n\nSome time later, you get an error file back\n\nNow you need to correlate that error with the original order\n\nRe-submit a corrected order with that item removed or error resolved\n\nWith synchronous APIs, you'd know immediately that SKU \"12345A\" should be \"12345-A\" and could fix it on the spot.\n\nYour system likely needs to track: \"Which files have I already processed?\" This leads to complex state management:\n\nMaintain a database of processed filenames\n\nHandle edge cases (what if a file is re-uploaded with the same name?)\n\nDeal with archive folder management\n\nDebug when files mysteriously reprocess\n\nWhen something goes wrong, debugging is harder:\n\n\"Did the file get uploaded?\" (Check your local logs)\n\n\"Did they receive it?\" (Ask the supplier to check their folder)\n\n\"Did they process it?\" (Wait for their response file... eventually)\n\n\"What went wrong?\" (Parse cryptic error codes from a text file)\n\nCompare this to modern API-based systems, which includes Folio's lightning automations, where you typically get:\n\nImmediate success/failure responses\n\nStatus endpoints to check processing state\n\nReal-time web-hooks for completion notifications\n\nGiven these limitations, why does SFTP persist in procurement? A few reasons:\n\nIt's battle-tested: SFTP has been around since the late 1990s and works reliably for what it's good at\n\nIt's firewall-friendly: One port (22) is easier for IT to approve than multiple ports\n\nIt's universally supported: Every major platform has SFTP clients and servers\n\nIt's good enough: For many batch-oriented workflows, hourly or weekly sweeps are sufficient\n\nIt's file-based: Files are easy to archive, audit, and replay if something goes wrong\n\nLow barrier to entry: Setting up SFTP is often simpler and cheaper for IT teams to enable than building APIs\n\nSFTP indeed provides a lowest-common-denominator solution that scales for many procurement workflows.\n\nSFTP isn't going away anytime soon, and that's good! It serves an important role in commerce integrations where batch processing makes sense.\n\nAt Folio, we're flexible — we use SFTP integrations all the time for compatibility with supplier and ERP systems, while also increasingly building real-time API integrations and Folio Lightning Automations to augment some of the concerns with file-based catalogs and purchase orders transferred with SFTP.\n\nFor example, with Folio Lightning Automations, a supplier EDI catalog feed provided via SFTP can be augmented with a Folio Lightning Automation to add real-time stock availability and other enhancements, like product images, that aren't typically included in EDI standards but may be available on a supplier's website. This hybrid approach creates a better user experience for our mutual customers and can drive more sales towards those suppliers, and requires no additional work from suppliers.\n\nWe're excited at Folio to continue collaborating with suppliers to bridge the gap between file-based standards and web-based APIs for more responsive, real-time procurement workflows that serve our hospitality customers.\n\nHopefully, at this point, the next time you're in a meeting and someone mentions \"the weekly catalog sweep\" or \"EDI invoices,\" you'll know exactly what's happening at 2 AM: a reliable, secure, wonderfully-vintage file transfer that keeps procurement moving forward, one batch at a time.\n\nAnd, if you do find yourself working with SFTP regularly, these tools can make your life easier:\n\nTransmit by Panic (macOS): Hands down the most elegant SFTP client I've used. The dual-pane interface makes it feel like working in Finder, and the sync features are incredibly powerful. Perfect for one-off file management.\n\nCyberduck (macOS/Windows): Free, open-source, and supports SFTP plus a dozen other protocols (S3, Azure, etc.). Great for quick connections and bookmarking frequent servers.\n\nFileZilla (Cross-platform): The old reliable. Not the prettiest UI, but it works everywhere and handles the basics well.\n\nemberstack/sftp Docker image: Modern, well-maintained, JSON-based configuration. Great for integration testing in CI/CD pipelines.\n\natmoz/sftp Docker image: Lightweight alternative, command-line based configuration. Perfect for quick local testing.\n\nHave questions about SFTP, EDI, or Lightning Integrations? Or just want to learn more about how Folio connects with suppliers? Drop us a line—we'd love to chat. We're also hiring for engineers!",

    "title": "Trump 25% tariff on European allies until Denmark sells Greenland to US",
    "description": "Heads of state across Europe respond in solidarity with Denmark and Greenland, and boycott of World Cup suggested",
    "fullText": "Heads of state across Europe respond in solidarity with Denmark and Greenland, and boycott of World Cup suggested\n\nDonald Trump threatened a 25% tariff on a slew of European countries including Denmark, Germany, France and the UK – until the US is allowed to purchase Greenland, in an extraordinary escalation of the president’s bid to claim the autonomous Danish territory.\n\nIn a lengthy post on Saturday on Truth Social, Trump said he would impose a 10% tariff on Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland beginning 1 February, “on any and all goods sent to the United States of America”.\n\nHe said the tariff will increase to 25% on 1 June.\n\n“This Tariff will be due and payable until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,” Trump said.\n\nThe president’s longstanding interest in acquiring Greenland “one way or the other” has become a fixation since the US raid that captured Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro earlier in January. While he has claimed the Arctic territory’s current status poses a national security threat to the US, this has been disputed by US allies, including Denmark.\n\nIn the Saturday morning post, Trump said forces from the eight European nations “have journeyed to Greenland, for purposes unknown”. It was an apparent reference to Nato allies deploying troops in Greenland on Thursday in response to Trump’s threats to forcefully take the Arctic island, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark.\n\n“The President’s statement comes as a surprise,” Lars Løkke Rasmussen, Denmark’s foreign minister, responded on social media. “Earlier this week, we had a constructive meeting with Vice President Vance and Secretary Rubio. The purpose of the increased military presence in Greenland, to which the President refers, is to enhance security in the Arctic.”\n\n“Every insult, threat, tariff and lie that we receive strengthens our resolve,” Rasmus Jarlov, the conservative chair of Denmark’s defence committee, wrote in more direct language. “The answer from Denmark and Greenland is final: We will never hand over Greenland. We pray that our true allies will stand with us because we are going to need it.”\n\nThe tariff threat against Nato allies united the leaders of those nations in unusually blunt language, after months of treading carefully for fear of triggering the volatile US president’s rage.\n\nIn response to Trump’s comments on Saturday, the EU commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said in a statement that the Europeans “have consistently underlined our shared transatlantic interest in peace and security in the Arctic, including through NATO. The pre-coordinated Danish exercise, conducted with allies, responds to the need to strengthen Arctic security and poses no threat to anyone.”\n\n“The EU stands in full solidarity with Denmark and the people of Greenland,” she added. “Tariffs would undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.”\n\n“Our position on Greenland is very clear – it is part of the Kingdom of Denmark and its future is a matter for the Greenlanders and the Danes,” the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, said. “Applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of Nato allies is completely wrong. We will of course be pursuing this directly with the US administration.”\n\nEmmanuel Macron, the French president, drew an implicit comparison between Trump’s threats to seize Greenland and Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. “No intimidation or threat will influence us – neither in Ukraine, nor in Greenland, nor anywhere else in the world when we are confronted with such situations,” Macron wrote in a social media riposte to Trump.\n\nFinland’s president, Alexander Stubb, whose excellence at golf previously made him something of a Trump whisperer, echoed the warning about a potential “downward spiral”.\n\n“We will not let ourselves be blackmailed,” the Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, added. That sentiment was echoed by Norway’s prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, who wrote: “Threats have no place among allies.”\n\nGermany’s leadership was more reserved, with the German chancellor Friedrich Merz leaving it to his spokesperson, Stefan Kornelius, to say only that the government “has taken note of” Trump’s statements and plans to coordinate with allies to “decide on appropriate responses at the appropriate time”.\n\nOn Friday, however, a spokesperson on foreign policy for the chancellor’s Christian Democrat party, Jürgen Hardt, suggested that Germany could threaten to boycott the World Cup Trump is hosting this summer “as a last resort in order to get Trump to see sense on the Greenland issue”. Polling done before Trump’s latest threat for the popular German tabloid Bild revealed broad support for a World Cup boycott, with 47% of Germans in favor and just 35% against, should the US annex Greenland.\n\nEven before the new tariff threat, there were mass protests in Greenland and Denmark on Saturday against Trump’s efforts to “acquire” the island.\n\nHis latest tariff threat comes just eight months after Trump announced that he had struck a trade pact with the UK – and six months after he announced a pact with the European Union.\n\nThe UK would have protection against future US tariffs “because I like them”, Trump declared in the summer. He described the pact with the EU as a “powerful deal” and an “important” partnership.\n\nTrump’s sudden reversal on Saturday even managed to alienate one of his biggest fans, Nigel Farage, the leader of the rightwing, anti-immigrant party Reform UK. “We don’t always agree with the US government and in this case we certainly don’t. These tariffs will hurt us,” Farage wrote.\n\nThere was also criticism from Trump’s own Republican party. Thom Tillis, a US senator from North Carolina, called the president’s threat “bad for America” but “great for Putin, Xi and other adversaries who want to see Nato divided”.\n\n“The fact that a small handful of ‘advisers’ are actively pushing for coercive action to seize territory of an ally is beyond stupid,” Tillis added.\n\nThe president has repeatedly turned to tariffs in a bid to force countries to bend to his will – with some success. Days after returning to office for his second term in early 2025, Colombia agreed to accept military aircraft carrying deported migrants after Trump threatened steep duties on the country’s exports to the US.\n\nTrump, who has previously extolled the benefits of tariffs as a negotiating tool, stressed on Saturday that the US was “immediately open to negotiation” with Denmark and any of the countries it was threatening to hit with these new tariffs.\n\nHis aggressive global trade strategy has raised fears for the US economy, which analysts and policymakers have warned could face significant damage from sweeping tariffs on the world.\n\nWhile the White House has played down such concerns, a vast wave of tariffs unveiled by Trump last spring – when he proclaimed the start of a new era for the US economy – was quickly reversed as global markets fell sharply.\n\nBut his administration’s erratic rollout of other tariffs nevertheless significantly strained US trade ties with the world. Americans now face an overall average effective tariff rate of 16.8%, according to the Budget Lab at Yale, the highest level since 1935.\n\nThe Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said recently that Greenland’s defence is a “common concern” for the whole of Nato. The Guardian reported that European troops had deployed to Greenland, in part, to establish what a more sustained ground deployment on the territory could look like, and partly to reassure the US that European Nato members were serious about Arctic security.\n\nFewer than one in five of Americans approve of Trump’s efforts to acquire Greenland, a poll published on Thursday by Reuters/Ipsos found. Both Democrats and Republicans oppose the effort, and only 4% of Americans think the US should take Greenland using military force.\n\nMuch of Trump’s wider trade strategy is currently in the hands of the US supreme court, which is mulling whether the imposition of many of his tariffs was legal. A decision could be announced as early as next week.",

    "description": "Post-training alignment often reduces LLM diversity, leading to a phenomenon known as mode collapse. Unlike prior work that attributes this effect to algorithmic limitations, we identify a fundamental, pervasive data-level driver: typicality bias in preference data, whereby annotators systematically favor familiar text as a result of well-established findings in cognitive psychology. We formalize this bias theoretically, verify it on preference datasets empirically, and show that it plays a central role in mode collapse. Motivated by this analysis, we introduce Verbalized Sampling, a simple, training-free prompting strategy to circumvent mode collapse. VS prompts the model to verbalize a probability distribution over a set of responses (e.",

    "fullText": "Back in 1993, Shoshanna Lonstein Gruss, then just Shoshanna Lonstein, became a tabloid darling because she dated Jerry Seinfeld at the height of his sitcom fame.\n\nThat was before you could be social media famous, but essentially, she was one of the first influencers, and she parlayed the fame of her four-year relationship into a successful career as a fashion designer.\n\nLonstein Gruss was a rare person, back in those days, who managed to turn fame by association into a real career. Her Shoshanna clothing brand was respected and enduring, not an attempt to capitalize on her name recognition, as happened with Monica Lewinsky's handbag line, or in a more recent example, Mike \"The Situation\" Sorrentino's \"Situation Nation” clothing line.\n\nShoshanna operates its own store, while also being sold at retailers including Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, and Bloomingdale's. It also has some items for sale on Amazon.\n\nNow the retail brand has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, on the same day that Saks Global and Neiman Marcus also filed. (It's important to note that the company behind the Shoshanna brand uses a slightly different spelling — i.e., Shoshanah Fashions.)\n\nLonstein Gruss may have started as a tabloid figure, but she has a deep history as a respected fashion designer.\n\n\"After 27 years of dedication and innovation, the Shoshanna collection has developed a legion of fans, including Mindy Kaling, Isla Fisher, Kelly Ripa, and The Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle. The collection can be found in luxury retailers like Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, Bloomingdale's, ShopBop, and Anthropologie as well as over 500 specialty stores in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia,\" the company shared on its website.\n\nShoshanah Fashions has not made a public statement about its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. The filing, however, came on the same day Saks Global filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nSaks Global's Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus are key distribution partners for Shoshanna Fashions, and the brand is almost certainly owed money by its partner, according to data shared with TheStreet by Ragini Bhalla, Head of Brand and Spokesperson for Creditsafe.\n\n\"Saks Inc. had a persistent and troubling pattern of paying vendors late in 2025,\npointing to sustained liquidity problems. Days Beyond Terms (DBT) refers to the\nnumber of days late (i.e., past payment terms) that a company pays its bills. One of the\nmost common indications that a company is struggling with cash flow is when its DBT is\nsignificantly higher than other companies in the same industry,\" the research showed.",

Despite Trump's boasts that the work would be done in six months, completion may not actually occur until after he leaves office in January 2029.\n\nWhat's in progress: Annexing Greenland\n\nAfter the U.S. military's removal of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, Trump renewed his calls to take over the semiautonomous Danish territory, insisting the United States will “have” Greenland “one way or another.” The president also tapped Gov. Jeff Landry, R-La., as the special U.S. envoy to Greenland, with a nod to the 1803 Louisiana Purchase from France that doubled the size of the U.S. Denmark says it is not ceding the world's largest island and that any invasion could have geopolitical implications given that Denmark is a NATO ally.\n\nTrump has tried to denigrate his predecessor, Joe Biden, by accusing the Democrat of overreliance on the autopen to sign presidential pardons, legislation and other key documents, despite the fact that Trump and other presidents have also used the tool. In October, a GOP-controlled House committee released a report alleging misuse of the autopen by the Biden administration. Trump's Department of Justice is investigating.\n\nThe president has said he wants to reopen an “expanded and rebuilt” Alcatraz, the notorious San Francisco Bay prison that has been closed for six-plus decades, to house immigration detainees. William K. Marshall III, the director of the Bureau of Prisons, toured the island in July. His agency announced that engineers and planners were developing design concepts, preliminary budgets and logistical models.\n\nTrump has posted on social media about extending traditional home mortgages repayments from 30 years to 50 years, suggesting that this could ease concerns about housing affordability. Economists say the switch would make it harder to build wealth through home ownership. Nonetheless, the White House has pledged to push the change. Officials have made little headway since, however, and Trump instead has looked to reduce mortgage rates by having the federal government buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds.\n\nTrump has frequently toyed with the idea of a third term, despite the Constitution stating that no one can be elected president “more than twice.” He acknowledged in October, “I would say that if you read it, it’s pretty clear I’m not allowed to run. It’s too bad.” White House chief of staff Susie Wiles also told Vanity Fair that Trump “knows he can’t run again.” Still, Trump mused this month, “I’m not allowed to run? I’m not sure,” and suggested there could be “a constitutional movement” to make that happen.\n\nWhat's faded away: Making Canada the 51st state\n\nDespite it being far-fetched, Trump has talked about making America's northern neighbor the “Great State of Canada” since before his second term started. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney assured Trump during a subsequent White House visit that his country “won’t be for sale, ever.” Carney suggested in June that Trump had lost interest. Trump has continued to bring up the idea, though, including during a September speech to military personnel in Virginia.\n\nTrump suggested in February that billionaire Elon Musk would be checking out Fort Knox in Kentucky to ensure that U.S. gold reserves were still there. The president even floated the notion of tagging along. Nothing came of that, however, and Musk has left the administration.\n\nSending thousands of migrants to Guantanamo\n\nThe president pledged to ship up to 30,000 of the “worst criminal aliens” to a U.S. Navy lockup in Cuba, and between February and June, about 500 immigrants were held there. But those numbers have since declined and sometimes reached zero. Housing migrants at Guantanamo is more expensive than in traditional detention centers, and doing so has drawn legal challenges.\n\nGaza Strip as a Mediterranean Sea resort\n\nTrump repeatedly suggested that the U.S. would take over war-torn Gaza and move out the Palestinians living there, and that U.S. developers could turn the area into a “Riviera of the Middle East,” after the war between Israel and Hamas. Gaza's reconstruction is a key question amid a Trump administration-brokered ceasefire, but Arab nations have rejected the idea of it being a vacation spot. Trump no longer mentions it.\n\nThe president says his tariffs could raise enough revenue for most Americans to get $2,000 payments. But he also has pledged to spend that same money on plugging deficits created by tax cuts, reducing the national debt, keeping a key nutrition program for low-income mothers and children funded during last year's government shutdown, aiding farmers and adding to defense spending for 2027. The U.S. collected about $289 billion in tariff revenue last year, which would be well short of what rebate checks would cost, even without the other promised earmarks. Trump also promised that slashing the size of federal government would give Americans rebate checks, but those never materialized.\n\nEliminating the federal income tax\n\nTrump has frequently said that steep import tariffs “will be enough to cut all of the income tax,” long suggesting that the U.S. was better off during the Gilded Age, when there was no income tax and federal revenue came largely from tariffs. “If you go back to the 1800s, 1887,” he said Friday, “We had money, so much money, we didn’t know what to do with it.” Lately, however, his administration has more often been promoting how much his tax and spending law might reduce 2026 tax bills for many Americans.\n\nTrump hates the dynamic kickoff, calling it a “demeaning” and “unromantic” affront to football's “pageantry.” By November, Trump was suggesting the NFL didn't “have the right to do that to the game” while acknowledging, “I don’t think they’ll change.”\n\nWhat's been accomplished: Bringing back the War Department\n\nTrump signed an executive order in September aiming to rename the Department of Defense as the Department of War. It will take an act of Congress to make the change lawful.\n\nThe board of trustees of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, stocked with Trump loyalists, voted in December to add Trump's name to Washington's premier performing arts venue, memorializing the 35th president. The move drew show cancellations and a lawsuit. The Kennedy Center is named by statute and would need Congress' approval for a legal change.\n\nReducing Chinese influence on the Panama Canal\n\nTrump suggested before his second term that the U.S. might retake control of the Panama Canal because Panama had failed to check Chinese influence over the waterway. His administration then pressured China to have the Hong Kong-based operator of ports at both ends of the canal sell those interests to a U.S. consortium, though that process faced delays. Panama withdrew from China's Belt and Road investment program in Latin America, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited Panama in April and agreed to bolster security coordination.\n\nThe president announced in December that his long-promised “ gold card ” was going on sale. It offers legal status, and an eventual pathway to U.S. citizenship, for individuals paying $1 million and corporations ponying up twice that per foreign-born employee, plus an upfront $15,000 fee to cover screening costs. The program is meant to replace EB-5 visas, which offered permanent U.S. residency in exchange for foreign investors spending a bit more than $1 million on a business that creates at least 10 full-time jobs for American workers.\n\nSince tearing down the East Wing, construction crews have worked into the night, hustling to finish the massive ballroom before Trump's term ends. The president initially said the structure, set to be bigger than the White House itself, would cost $200 million but he now says $400 million. He has promised that it will be paid for by himself and private donors. The White House has released only a partial list of who is actually contributing and has argued that parts of the project's plans are “ top secret.”\n\nMore to watch: Possible US military action in Colombia, Mexico and Iran\n\nFollowing the U.S. operation in Venezuela, Trump accused Colombian President Gustavo Petro of “making cocaine and selling it to the United States” and said U.S intervention in that country “sounds good to me.” After a friendly call with Petro, however, Trump suggested that “the situation of drugs and other disagreements” had been defused. Trump, though, also maintains that Mexico is “run” by drug cartels and says, “You have to do something with Mexico.” He's warned Iran that if that country starts “killing people like they have in the past” during a recent round of sweeping, anti-government protests, then “they are going to get hit very hard by the United States.” Killings have run into the thousands, but by Friday, Trump appeared to be backing off those threats.\n\nCuba collapsing with or without US intervention\n\nTrump has repeatedly noted Cuba's weakened position since the U.S. captured Maduro, whose country was a major ally of the communist-run island. Trump has said Cuba “only survives because of Venezuela” and is “ready to fall” without the U.S. intervening. Venezuela's economic and social chaos and Maduro's ouster have raised questions about Cuba's future. But Trump has also suggested Cuba “make a deal, BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE,” without saying what that means.\n\nTrump says he wants a Golden Dome missile defense program — a multilayered, $175 billion system that would put U.S. weapons in space for the first time — to be fully operational by January 2029. Defense officials say more likely all that will be achieved by then is some initial capability for the system. It is envisioned to include ground- and space-based capabilities that can detect and stop missiles at various stages of attack.\n\nTrump said he talked to Rob Manfred before Major League Baseball's commissioner reinstated Cincinnati Reds slugger Pete Rose in May. Rose died in 2024 but still faced a baseball ban over betting on the game, despite having a record 4,256 career hits. Trump now wants Rose in the Hall of Fame, but that's up to the Hall’s Classic Baseball Committee, which likely will not meet until at least December 2027.\n\nThe fourth installment of the cop buddy-comedy series starring Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan will be coming out after a reported request from Trump. Paramount, which is co-owned by David Ellison, son of Oracle co-founder and Trump megadonor Larry Ellison, is set to distribute the film. Semafor reported that Trump had asked Ellison to help revive the franchise. Warner Bros. released the first three “Rush Hour” films, but eschewed the fourth after earlier sexual misconduct allegations against its director, Brett Ratner. Ratner also made a documentary on first lady Melania Trump.",

    "description": "In the 12 days since the U.S. seized Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, interim President Delcy Rodriguez has been working to consolidate her own power, installing loyalists in",
    "fullText": "Jan 17 (Reuters) - In the 12 days since the U.S. seized Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, interim President Delcy Rodriguez has been working to consolidate her own power, installing loyalists in key positions to protect herself from internal threats while meeting U.S. demands to boost oil production.\n\nRodriguez, 56, a quiet but rigorous technocrat who was vice president and oil minister, has named a central banker to help run the economy, a presidential chief of staff and, crucially, a new head of Venezuela’s feared DGCIM, the military counterintelligence agency ​built over decades with Cuban assistance.\n\nMajor General Gustavo Gonzalez, 65, will now head the agency, a move three sources with knowledge of the government described as an early gambit by Rodriguez to counter what many in Venezuela say is the biggest threat to her leadership: Diosdado ‌Cabello, Venezuela's hardline interior minister with close ties to the security services and the dreaded “colectivos” motorcycle gangs which have killed opposition supporters.\n\n\"She is very clear that she doesn't have the capacity to survive without the consent of the Americans,\" said one source close to the government. \"She's already reforming the armed forces, removing people and naming new officials.\"\n\nInterviews with seven sources in Venezuela, including diplomats, business ‌people and politicians, reveal in previously unreported detail the fault line at the heart of Venezuela's government and the risks it poses to Rodriguez as she tries to consolidate internal control while meeting Trump administration dictates on oil sales. The sources spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.\n\nThe tightrope Rodriguez is attempting to walk was evident in her first major speech since taking office. Addressing parliament in a national annual address on Thursday, she called for unity, stressed her bona fides as Maduro’s loyal deputy, and vowed to forge a new chapter in Venezuela’s politics with increased oil investment.\n\nVenezuela’s communications ministry, which handles all press inquiries for the government and individual officials, did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\n\nThe White House responded to emailed questions from Reuters by referring the news agency to recent comments made by Trump. In an interview with Reuters on Wednesday, Trump said Rodriguez \"has been very good to deal with\" and that he expected her to visit ⁠Washington at some point.\n\nRodriguez - nicknamed \"the tsarina\" for her business connections - has broad influence over the country's ‌civilian levers of power, including the crucial oil industry, and now also enjoys the backing of the United States. That backing appeared to be reemphasized on Thursday when Rodriguez met with CIA director John Ratcliffe in Caracas.\n\nThe other main faction is led by Cabello.\n\nCabello, who also heads the ruling PSUV socialist party, is a former soldier with a weekly four-hour show on state television, which has run for 12 years. His first public act after Maduro's capture was to appear on screen ‍dressed in a flak jacket and surrounded by armed guards as he led a chant of, \"To doubt is to betray.”\n\nOfficials in the Trump administration had contact with Cabello months before the operation to seize Maduro and have also been in communication with him since, four sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, warning him against using the security services or colectivos to target the opposition.\n\nCabello, who was jailed in Venezuela for backing eventual socialist President Hugo Chavez in a failed 1992 coup, is under indictment in the U.S. and has a $25 million reward for his capture.\n\nSo far Cabello has been conciliatory towards Rodriguez, saying they are “very united” and he arrived at Thursday's national address alongside Rodriguez and her ​brother Jorge, the head of the national assembly. But sources with knowledge of their relationship told Reuters that Cabello remains the biggest threat to her ability to govern.\n\nIn Caracas, security forces are skittish. A few hours after Rodriguez was sworn in, there was a brief burst of anti-aircraft fire outside ‌the presidential palace that some feared could be another U.S. attack. Instead, reports suggest it was a miscommunication between police and the presidential guard, which shot down police drones. The government said the craft were spy drones, without explaining who they belonged to.\n\nAcross the country, people are reeling from the shock of Maduro’s capture and unsure whether to be hopeful or scared. In some places, local socialist party branches have asked members to spy on their neighbors and report anyone celebrating Maduro’s downfall, according to three party members who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nIn this tense environment, Rodriguez must persuade party loyalists that she is not a U.S. puppet who betrayed Maduro. She must also stabilize an economy that saw prices for basic goods soar in the days since the U.S. attack, as well as wrestle some degree of control over the sprawling military-linked patronage networks that have developed over decades of Chavismo rule.\n\nVenezuela has as many as 2,000 generals and admirals, more than double the number in the United States, a military superpower with 20 times more active duty and reserve troops. Senior and retired officers control food distribution, raw materials and the state oil company PDVSA, while dozens of generals sit on the boards of private firms.\n\nMany officials are able to run ⁠their regional fiefdoms as they see fit - ordering patrols or checkpoints by soldiers under their command - and some parts of the country and capital Caracas have seen increased activity ​by security services since Maduro's capture.\n\nREPRESSION ‘ALREADY HAS A NAME’\n\nGonzalez, the new head of the military counterintelligence agency DGCIM, has over his long career in Venezuela’s government worked closely with Cabello, particularly during ​two stints as head of the separate civilian spy agency.\n\nYet it is to Rodriguez that Gonzalez owes his most recent posts. In 2024, Rodriguez tapped Gonzalez for a top job at the state oil company, Venezuela’s most important company and the engine of the country’s economy.\n\nQuestions still remain over how much control Gonzalez will be able to exert over DGCIM. Cabello's allies within the agency could undermine him, the three sources with knowledge of the government said.\n\nOne source with knowledge of the inner workings ‍of the security services said Gonzalez's DGCIM predecessor General Javier Marcano struggled to control ⁠the agency.\n\n\"The role of boss of repression already has a name… Diosdado,\" this person said. \"Marcano was coordinating with (civilian) militias and with the colectivos, but he had serious difficulties controlling DGCIM because his designation was nominal.\"\n\nThe colectivos, closely connected to Cabello, could also make the country ungovernable by implementing a so-called \"anarchization\" strategy, which was first designed to fend off U.S. intervention but could be directed ⁠against Rodriguez, the source close to the government told Reuters. That strategy would mobilize the intelligence services and colectivos to plunge Caracas into disorder and chaos.\n\nCabello could also slow the pace of prisoner releases that have been hailed by Trump. They have been proceeding much more slowly than demanded by families and rights groups, creating a potential pressure point for Rodriguez.\n\nOutside of Venezuela, ‌however, pressure on Cabello continues to mount.\n\n\"For the Trump administration to achieve a real transition in Venezuela, sooner or later Diosdado Cabello must face U.S. justice,\" U.S. Representative Maria Elvira Salazar said on X this month. \"When Diosdado is brought to justice, it will be ‌a decisive step toward a democratic transition in Venezuela and the release of all political hostages.\"",

    "fullText": "Cleveland Metroparks marked a wildlife milestone that had conservationists and scientists buzzing: trail cameras recorded a fisher, a medium-sized mammal in the weasel family — and this was verified as the first sighting of the species in Cuyahoga County in more than 100 years, Fox 8 reported.\n\n\"This is tremendously exciting,\" reads the caption from Cleveland Metroparks' Instagram post, which reflects on the significance of the sighting for both the region's natural history and ongoing conservation efforts.\n\nFishers disappeared from this part of Ohio in the mid-1800s, mainly due to trapping and habitat loss, the post detailed. Their return signals the success of long-term restoration and smart management of local environments.\n\nTrail cameras, like the ones used in the Cleveland area, are convenient and powerful tools that help wildlife experts monitor population health, track movements, and gather evidence of rehabilitation and species recovery.\n\nEach captured image contributes to a broader understanding of how native species are reestablishing themselves. They give communities insight into the health of their local ecosystems.\n\nThe role of trail cameras in conservation is significant. Recently, trail cameras captured unique footage of a grizzly bear in the Yukon and a leopard in West Coast National Park in South Africa.\n\nThe resurgence of species like the fisher carries benefits that ripple beyond the woods.\n\nHealthy wildlife populations help support balanced ecosystems, which humans also rely on for food, water, and clean air. Communities can take pride in conservation victories, seeing firsthand that their efforts pay off and that people can positively impact their surroundings.\n\nThe return of a species after a century shows that thoughtful environmental management can foster biodiversity, helping ecosystems thrive alongside human development.\n\nFor Cleveland Metroparks and the Ohio Division of Wildlife, the fisher's appearance is a reminder that conservation works.\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nTrail cameras won't just document these rare moments; they will also help guide continued efforts to protect species and habitats, proving that even a century-old absence can have a hopeful comeback story.\n\n\"Phenomenal,\" said one local resident when learning of the fisher's reappearance.\n\nAnother said: \"This is huge!!! The conservation and natural recovery efforts of this state are nothing short of astounding.\"\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

At the time, Agnel admitted the incidents occurred, but denied that any coercion took place.\n\nThat year, France passed a law that defined sex with a child under the age of 15 — France's age of consent — as rape. It is now punishable by up to 20 years in jail.\n\nIn July 2024, Agnel, who retired from swimming in 2016, attended a meeting with the victim, who is now in her early 20s, that he had requested, per Le Monde.\n\nWant to keep up with the latest crime coverage? \n\nAgnel won gold in the 200m freestyle and the 4x100m freestyle relay at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. He qualified for the 2016 Games in Rio, but failed to get through the heats that year. He announced his retirement from the sport soon after.\n\nIf you or someone you know has been sexually assaulted, please contact the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-656-HOPE (4673) or go to rainn.org.",

    "description": "Visits to the US by international travelers declined for the eighth straight month in December, in a continued blow to the tourism industry.",
    "fullText": "The US isn't the tourist destination it once was.\n\nVisits to the US by international travelers declined for the eighth straight month in December, according to data released earlier this month by the National Travel and Tourism Office.\n\nIn 2025, visits to the US were down among 10 of the top 20 overseas tourist-generating countries, including India, Germany, and South Korea.\n\nThe decline is a sustained blow to the travel and tourism industries, which in 2024 supported more than 15 million jobs, and generated about $1.3 trillion in economic output — including $181 billion from inbound international travel.\n\nMajor tourism hubs like Las Vegas are seeing widespread layoffs due to the downturn, forcing workers to get creative with their career pivots. Business Insider reported earlier this month that laid-off hospitality workers contributed to a 55% increase in dancer auditions at a Las Vegas strip club compared to the prior six months.\n\nIt doesn't appear the travel bug has gone anywhere — just that international tourists are avoiding the US.\n\nIn Australia, for example, overseas arrivals and departures data released Friday by the country's Bureau of Statistics shows that international travel returned to pre-pandemic levels just before the lockdowns began in 2020. Australians travelling to Canada rose 4% in the last year, 10% more visited India, and visits by Australians to China and Japan rose 20% and 21%, respectively, but 3.2% fewer booked a trip to the US.\n\nFewer Canadian travelers are visiting the US, as well, opting instead to go further south to Mexico, Business Insider reported last April.\n\nComplicating demand were ongoing trade frictions, tariff battles, and geopolitical unease, which helped fuel grass-roots boycotts of US goods and, in some cases, changes in travel plans.\n\nEuropean travel firms and analysts pointed to tariff-driven consumer backlash and growing anti-American sentiment as factors that contributed to early-year softness in bookings, even as demand showed signs of rebounding later in the summer.\n\nDomestic travel has helped cushion the blow so far, with the US Travel Association projecting that domestic leisure travel was forecast to grow 1.9% to $895 billion in 2025.\n\nHowever, if international visitors continue to stay away, destinations that depend on overseas spending — from iconic tourism cities to national parks — could feel growing pressure as the US heads into a high-stakes stretch of global events in 2026 and beyond.",

    "description": "Actor Matt Damon said Netflix wants action movies to reiterate plot lines multiple times because people are on their phones while watching a movie.",
    "fullText": "Netflix wants to change the way action movies are made amid the never-ending battle for our sustained attention, according to \"Bourne\" actor Matt Damon.\n\nIn an interview on the \"Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast, Damon and longtime collaborator and friend Ben Affleck spoke about their latest experience costarring in and coproducing their first Netflix-exclusive heist film, \"The Rip,\" which was released Friday. The two actors talked about how streaming and short-form video platforms have upended the way movies are consumed, made, and sold to audiences.\n\nDamon said Netflix is now asking for action films to have bigger sequences occur within the first five minutes of the movie and suggesting that actors reiterate the plot line to cater to viewers who are on their phones.\n\nThe actor said the \"standard way\" he learned to make an action film was to have the finale — \"the big one with all the explosions\" that a production spends most of its money on — occur in the third act.\n\n\"Now, they're like, 'Can we get a big one in the first five minutes? We want people to stay tuned in. And you know it wouldn't be terrible if you reiterated the plot three or four times in the dialogue because people are on their phones while they're watching,'\" he said. \"And so then it's going to really start to infringe on how we're telling a story.\"\n\nDamon didn't specify if Netflix gave the instruction to the actor and producer for his latest heist movie.\n\nA Netflix spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment sent during the weekend.\n\nAffleck added that the suggestions aren't reflected in every new action film or series coming out on Netflix. The actor pointed to \"Adolescence,\" a crime miniseries that has episodes shot in one continuous take. The show was released in March.\n\nDamon said he felt the show was an exception.\n\n\"My feeling is just that it demonstrates that you don't need to do any of that\" stuff, Affleck said.\n\nHe later added, \"It's like supply and demand. People want to look at their phones, they look at TikTok, they're going to do that. I think what you can do is make shit the best you can. Make it really good.\"",

    "description": "Griffin Canning pitched for the New York Mets in 2025.",
    "fullText": "According to a new report from Jon Heyman of the New York Post, the St. Louis Cardinals are interested in rehabbing free agent starting pitcher Griffin Canning, who spent the 2025 campaign with the New York Mets.\n\nThe Mets have shown interest in bringing back Griffin Canning, who should be ready around Opening Day after suffering an Achilles tear last year. The Cardinals and White Sox also are interested.\n\nNow 29 years old, Canning is a six-year veteran of the Los Angeles Angels and Mets. He's gone 32-37 in his career with a 4.65 ERA. He had a career-high seven wins in 2023, and again in 2025 before getting hurt. He was 7-3 with a 3.77 ERA in 16 starts for the Mets. He hasn't traditionally struck out a lot of batters, but he had 70 Ks in 76.1 innings a season ago, signaling that perhaps he's unlocked more swing-and-miss stuff.\n\nThe Cardinals could be interested in a veteran innings-eater to help keep the pressure off young prospects like Quinn Matthews and Liam Doyle. Even though it's unclear exactly when he'd be able to return to a big-league rotation, he should be able to provide good cover for those prospects. The Cardinals may be able to trade him for a prospect at the trade deadline, or perhaps they could ink him to a multi-year deal, allowing him to rehab and work through things in 2026, while flipping him at some point in 2027.\n\nThe Cardinals are rebuilding, but they should be able to provide Canning with opportunities to rebuild his value. If he's looking for a promised rotation spot and an opportunity to impress people ahead of 2027, he could take a one-year deal in St. Louis. He could also end up being dealt to a contender at the deadline, giving him a chance to win a World Series.\n\nMatthew Liberatore, Dustin May and Andre Pallante are assured rotation spots, with Richard Fitts and Hunter Dobbins likely serving as options once they are recovered from their 2025 injuries. Beyond them, Doyle and Matthews are waiting.\n\nThe one that could impact Canning negatively? Perhaps there's too many variables, too many prospects and too many possibilities in the rotation as is. Maybe the rotation spot isn't guaranteed all year, which could scare him to an organization with more security.\n\nRemember to join our CARDINALS on ROUNDTABLE community, which is FREE!

    "fullText": "New Jersey Devils forward Jesper Bratt is set to play his 600th NHL game tonight as the Devils take on the Hurricanes.\n\nBratt made his NHL debut against the Hurricanes in October 2017. Ahead of his milestone game, Bratt shared his thoughts with NJD.tv.\n\n“It’s really special. Time goes fast,” Bratt said. “Super honored and happy to be doing it here in the same place and in front of the same fans I did my first game. It’s going to be a special time.”\n\nIn 599 NHL games, Bratt has scored 161 goals and 322 assists. Over his nine seasons with the Devils, Bratt has become a key contributor.\n\nReflecting on Bratt’s journey since being drafted in the sixth round (162nd pick), head coach Sheldon Keefe offered his perspective on the forward’s career.\n\n\"When I've been asked about him and reflect on him and what I observe is a guy that works extremely hard, is extremely focused and disciplined,\" Keefe said. \"How he prepares, how he seeks to improve, how he accepts coaching and information. In that sense, he's an easy guy to coach because he's all about getting better and all about helping the team.\"\n\nThis season, Bratt has appeared in 47 games, earning 36 points (11 G, 25 A). Keefe continued to highlight the left winger’s accomplishments.\n\n“From where he was drafted to how quickly he got into the league to how he found ways to be successful despite being an undersized guy to being a premier player in the league,\" Keefe said. \"Quite a story, great accomplishment for him. I feel like he's just getting started.\"\n\nThe puck will drop at 7 PM tonight.\n\nake sure you bookmark THN's New Jersey Devils site for THN's latest news, exclusive interviews, breakdowns, and so much more.\n\nFor action-packed issues, access to the entire magazine archive and a free issue, com/free. Get the latest news and trending stories by subscribing to our newsletter here. And share your thoughts by commenting below the article on THN.com or creating your own post in our community forum.",

    "fullText": "NFL playoffs overtime rules, explained: How tie games are decided compared to regular season, preseason originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nCan an NFL playoff game end in a tie?\n\nNFL overtime rules for playoff games\n\nNFL overtime rules for regular season\n\nNFL overtime rules for preseason\n\nHistory of NFL playoff overtime rules\n\nPlayoff football tends to be neck-and-neck. Sometimes, it even requires some extra time.\n\nWhile no games in last year's NFL playoffs required overtime, it wasn't too long ago that the Super Bowl went an extra frame, when the Kansas City Chiefs took down the San Francisco 49ers to go back-to-back in February 2024 on a game-winning touchdown pass in overtime.\n\nGiven the nature of the postseason, NFL overtime rules are a bit different in the playoffs vs. the regular season. Most notably, the playoff rules prioritize giving both teams a chance to win, something that changed in recent years.\n\nHere's everything to know about how the 2026 NFL playoff overtime rules work, and how they compare to the regular season and preseason.\n\nMORE: Everything to know about the NFL's virtual measurement system\n\nNo, an NFL playoff game cannot end in a tie. In the preseason and regular season, games can end in ties. However, with the league needing a team to move on to the next round of the playoffs, there is no possibility of a tie in the postseason.\n\nTeams will play more overtime periods until a tie is broken in the playoffs.\n\nMORE: How does NFL MVP voting work?\n\nThe NFL's newest overtime rules for playoff games were implemented in the 2023 postseason. The biggest change was largely in response to the 2022 AFC Championship Game between the Chiefs and Bills, guaranteeing that both teams would get a possession in overtime.\n\nHere's how OT works for playoff games via the NFL rulebook:\n\nIf the score is still tied at the end of an overtime period — or if the second team’s initial possession has not ended — the teams will play another overtime period. There can be no ties in the playoffs. Play will continue regardless of how many overtime periods are needed for a winner to be determined.\n\nThere will be a two-minute intermission between each overtime period. There will not be a halftime intermission after the second period.\n\nThe captain who lost the first overtime coin toss will either choose to possess the ball or select which goal his team will defend, unless the team that won the coin toss deferred that choice.\n\nEach team will have an opportunity to possess the ball in overtime.\n\nEach team gets three timeouts during a half.\n\nThe same timing rules that apply at the end of the second and fourth regulation periods also apply at the end of a second or fourth overtime period.\n\nIf there is still no winner at the end of a fourth overtime period, there will be another coin toss, and play will continue until a winner is declared.\n\nRegardless of whether the team who receives the opening overtime kickoff scores a touchdown, the other team is guaranteed a possession.  However, the game is over if a safety or defensive touchdown is scored.\n\nIf the game is tied after both teams possess the ball once, then the next score wins.\n\nMORE: Explaining how the NCAA OT format works and differences from NFL\n\nIn comparison to the postseason, overtime in the NFL regular season is a bit different, mostly because games can end in ties.\n\nHere are the official regular season overtime rules, via the NFL rulebook:\n\nAt the end of regulation, the referee will toss a coin to determine which team will possess the ball first in overtime. The visiting team captain will call the toss.\n\nNo more than one 10-minute period will follow a three-minute intermission. Each team must possess, or have the opportunity to possess, the ball, rather than one team being able to win the game by scoring on its first overtime possession. The exception is if the team kicking off to start the overtime period scores a safety on the receiving team’s initial possession, then the team that kicked off is the winner.\n\nSudden death play — where the game ends on any score (safety, field goal or touchdown) — continues until a winner is determined after each team has had an opportunity to possess the ball.\n\nThe point after try is not attempted if the game ends on a touchdown.\n\nIf the score is still tied at the end of the overtime period, the result of the game will be recorded as a tie.\n\nThere are no instant replay coach’s challenges; all reviews will be initiated by the replay official.\n\nMORE:Breaking down the NFL's newest kickoff rules\n\nThe most straightforward NFL overtime rules come in the preseason: there is no overtime. With. games not counting for much in the preseason, the league doesn't bother to try and break ties.\n\nThat change was made in 2021, prioritizing player health and safety in games that do not have any bearing on the standings. Players can be evaluated from the first through fourth quarters, and no extra periods are necessary.\n\nMORE: Why does the NFL allow ties in the regular season?\n\nA lot has changed since the first NFL game to go to overtime on Aug. 28, 1955, between the Rams and Giants. That game was played under “sudden death” rules, and the Rams won. From there, the overtime format was fully introduced.\n\nThe NFL moved forward with that model before implementing sudden-death overtime for regular-season games 16 years later. In the original format, the first team to score any points at all won the game. That included kicking a game-winning field goal. “Sudden death” remained the format for 35 years.\n\nIn 2010, the playoff overtime rules were tweaked. For teams that received the ball first, a field goal no longer counted as a game-ender in “sudden death.” Under the change, only a touchdown on the first possession of overtime could win the game in the playoffs. Otherwise, the other team would get a possession.\n\nThat format was added to the preseason and regular season in 2012.\n\nThe length of overtime was altered in 2017, decreasing from a full 15 minutes to just 10 minutes.\n\nIn 2021, overtime was removed from preseason games, with the NFL citing player safety to avoid unnecessary periods.\n\nMost recently, the NFL changed the playoff overtime rules in 2022, assuring both teams would get at least one possession in overtime of a postseason game. Regardless of whether the first team scored a touchdown, the other team was given a shot to tie the game or come back to win it. If the score remained tied after each team had a possession, then “sudden death” began.\n\nMORE: What is considered a catch in the NFL?\n\nHere are the six longest NFL games ever, all of which went deep into overtime. Because regular season games can end in ties, the longest overtime games all consist of playoff games.\n\nAll six of the games below required two overtime periods to decide a winner.\n\nAFC Divisional Round (Dolphins vs. Chiefs)\n\nAFL Championship (Texans vs. Oilers)\n\nAFC Divisional Round (Browns vs. Jets)\n\nAFC Divisional Round (Ravens vs. Broncos)\n\nAFC Divisional Round (Raiders vs. Colts)\n\nNFC Divisional Round (Panthers vs. Rams)\n\nMORE:What is Scorigami in the NFL?",

    "description": "Philadelphia Phillies hitting coach believes Bryce Harper could be better in a key area.",
    "fullText": "The big narrative surrounding Bryce Harper this offseason is whether or not the eight-time All-Star and two-time MVP is still an “elite” player. A debate that Philadelphia Phillies president Dave Dombrowski sparked with a comment during a media availability earlier this winter.\n\nWhether Harper is an elite player is subjective, but there is one area he could improve upon heading into the 2026 season, which Kevin Long recently detailed during an appearance on MLB Network Radio.\n\nThe Phillies' hitting coach detailed how Harper must improve his strike-zone awareness and plate discipline.\n\n“Bryce needs to make sure his strike zone is better than it was last year. I mean, going there this year,\" Long said. \"He sees the least amount of strikes in all of baseball. If that's the case, then we gotta be a little more disciplined in our own. So there's always something.\"\n\nIt’s important to note that Long by no means was calling out Harper or singling the slugger out. The coach was talking about how everyone on the roster has areas for improvement.\n\nThat said, Harper having better plate discipline is a fair criticism and area of improvement ot focus on. Harper has always been a free-swinging type player, but his discipline during the 2025 season wasn’t great.\n\nHarper had a chase-rate of 35.6 percent and a whiff-rate of 30.7 percent, both of which were among his career-highs in those categories. Still, the slugger managed to slash .261/.357/.487 with an OPS of .844, including 27 home runs and 32 doubles.\n\nEven with the high whiff and chase rate, Harper was still a productive hitter. Now, just imagine what he could get back to if Harper can make some of the adjustments Long is proposing.\n\nWhen talking about Harper and the rest of the Phillies roster, Long continued, “there are things these guys can do and work on. That sometimes it's my idea, sometimes it's theirs, but we'll attack those areas and try to get better.”\n\nIf Harper can make some of these small adjustments and be a little more selective with what he’s swinging at, he could, in return, be more productive and impactful at the plate.",

    "description": "The Bruins were outclassed physically by the Buckeyes.",
    "fullText": "COLUMBUS, Ohio - UCLA head coach Mick Cronin was disgusted with his team's lack of defense on Saturday.\n\nThe Bruins (12-6, 4-3) fell to the Ohio State Buckeyes (12-5, 4-3) 86-74 and a premier offensive day from the Bruins, led by a 30 point performance Tyler Bilodeau, meant nothing in the face of the way they were outclassed on the defensive end and bullied physically throughout the game.\n\n\"We wasted a great shot-making day from him [Bilodeau] with awful defense,\" Cronin said (via UCLA Athletics).\n\nCronin didn't mince words after the game. At this point, Cronin doesn't even feel that he can put winning basketball with the team that he has. Cronin shouldered the blame for the loss, not because of any specific failure of coaching, but because he was the one that recruited and signed the players that he now feels are inept at defending strong opponents and lack the willingness to put themselves on the line physically.\n\n\"Our defense is an embarrassment today. Last couple games it was great. Today, we couldn't guard them... We had nobody interested in rising to the challenge defensively. Everybody wants somebody else to get the dirty work. We're a team that struggles to have dirty work guys,\" Cronin said.\n\nEffort is something that Cronin takes very seriously. Throughout the season, especially after bad games, Cronin has lambasted his team for an unwillingness to make hard plays, whether that's been on the rebounding front or in guarding the other team.\n\nThe Bruins have shown flashes of defensive effort at times, but never enough to chain together a consistent streak of wins. UCLA was riding a two-game win streak going into Saturday's game, which was a brief reprieve from the struggles they'd had in the previous two games, but their flaws reared their ugly heads again.\n\nThe Bruins were especially outclassed when it came to rebounding, a major point of contention for Cronin. The Buckeyes out-rebounded the Bruins 37-27 and had 12 more defenisve rebounds in particular. It was a hard shooting day for UCLA overall, but they kept up with Ohio State in most other stats beyond rebounding, which became the difference maker as any extra chances UCLA might have had were stripped away again and again by their inability to keep the ball away from the Buckeyes in the glass.\n\nThe biggest failure of the Bruins in Saturday's game was by far their handling of the Buckeyes' star guards senior Bruce Thornton or sophomore John Mobley Jr. Cronin said that UCLA had plenty of time to prep for those two in particular, but no one in blue could keep up, or even tried to.\n\nMobley Jr. led the Buckeyes with 28 points while Thornton turned in a 21 point, eight rebound performance.\n\n\"Two really tough guards and we knew that coming into the game. We've just to be more ready to play and step up to the fight,\" Bilodeau said.",

    "fullText": "Mavericks guard Klay Thompson saw Utah Jazz forward Ace Bailey crowding him on the perimeter and decided to teach the rookie a lesson.\n\nWith Bailey face-guarding him, the future Hall of Famer simply rose up and shot over the rookie for one of his six first-half 3-pointers. Moments later, with second-year forward Cody Williams — the younger brother of NBA champion Jalen Williams — closing hard, Thompson again elevated and drilled another shot over the contest.\n\nThompson caught fire early, scoring all 23 of his points in the first half.\n\nAlong the way, he moved into fourth place on the NBA’s all-time list for made 3-pointers, passing Damian Lillard during Saturday’s game against the Jazz. Only James Harden, Ray Allen and Stephen Curry now sit ahead of him.\n\nThompson continued his historic pace by knocking down a turnaround jumper at the 4:56 mark of the first quarter to reach 17,000 career points. He became the 109th player in NBA history to reach the milestone.\n\nThompson’s big night helped the Mavericks beat the Jazz 138-120 at the American Airlines Center on Saturday evening.\n\nThe game marked the fourth and final regular-season meeting between the teams.

    "description": "The 49ers will be without tight end George Kittle in the divisional round of the playoffs. Here's the latest Kittle injury update:",
    "fullText": "As the San Francisco 49ers and Seattle Seahawks begin their NFL playoffs clash in the divisional round, one star player is conspicuously absent.\n\nWhat happened to George Kittle? And when could the 49ers' tight end return?\n\nIn last week's wild-card round game against the Philadelphia Eagles, Kittle tore his right Achilles tendon after catching a pass in the second quarter. The 49ers tight end had to be carted back to the locker room and was quickly ruled out of the remainder of the game with an Achilles injury. Head coach Kyle Shanahan confirmed to reporters after the game that Kittle had torn his Achilles.\n\nNFL NEWS, TAKES, FANTASY ADVICE: USA TODAY Sports has you covered with our NFL vodcast\n\nSan Francisco officially placed Kittle on injured reserve on Jan. 13. The 49ers' star tight end was scheduled to undergo surgery to repair the torn tendon on Jan. 14, according to Shanahan.\n\nHere's what to know about Kittle's status moving forward:\n\n49ERS AT SEAHAWKS: Predictions, picks, odds for NFL Divisional Round\n\nKittle's season is officially over after the 49ers placed their lead tight end on injured reserve. He will have to wait until next season for his return.\n\n\"Football sucks sometimes,\" Kittle wrote in an Instagram post. \"But I love it. I love these guys and this team. Heartbroken but have felt so much love and support from everyone reaching out. I’ll be good. Thank you. We aren’t done yet! Also when your team owner is the first person to meet you in the locker room, you know you’re in a special place. Cheers, all my love.\"\n\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, the rehab process following a surgery to repair a ruptured Achilles can last anywhere from four to six months before most patients \"return to their former level of activity.\" However, \"some problems can persist for up to a year\" without more exercises to rebuild strength and stability.\n\nHow long Kittle remains out will depend on the severity of his Achilles rupture and the length of his rehab process. The timeline for his return may become clearer once Kittle is out of surgery and has started his rehab.\n\nGEORGE KITTLE INJURY: Is it the 'last straw' for 49ers? Why one star foresees opposite effect\n\nKittle played in just 11 games this season in another year tainted by injuries. A Grade 3 hamstring tear kept him out of five games early in the season, and an ankle sprain later in the season caused Kittle to miss another game.\n\nHere's Kittle's numbers from a 2025 season that featured fewer games played for the tight end than any season since 2020:\n\nDespite the relative lack of playing time in 2025, Kittle's seven touchdowns were the third-highest total of his career behind 11 (2022) and eight (2024). The 49ers' tight end also earned a fifth straight Pro Bowl nod in 2025 and seventh in the last eight years.\n\nGeorge Kittle (season-ending IR – Achilles)\n\nTonges, who had his first career reception with a touchdown in Week 1 this year, is a fourth-year tight end who has taken on the primary tight end role in Kittle's absences this year. His 46 targets during the regular season were the most of any 49ers pass-catchers outside of Kittle, running back Christian McCaffrey and San Francisco's three leading wide receivers.\n\nFarrell joined the 49ers as a free agent last offseason after four years in Jacksonville and recorded his first career receiving touchdown in Week 2. Willis was on the 49ers' practice squad for most of the season and re-signed to the team's active roster after Kittle's Achilles injury.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: George Kittle injury update: When will 49ers TE return?",

    "fullText": "The San Jose Sharks have been a nice surprise this season. At the time of this writing, they have a 24-20-3 record and have the second wild card spot in the Western Conference.\n\nWith the Sharks being right in the playoff race, it would be understandable if they considered adding to their roster by the deadline. This is especially so if a potential target would benefit them beyond this season.\n\nWhen looking at trade candidates around the NHL, one player who could make sense for the Sharks to take a chance on is Edmonton Oilers forward Andrew Mangiapane.\n\nThere is a real expectation that the Oilers will end up trading Mangiapane this season. The 29-year-old forward has struggled to find his fit in Edmonton, and he is reportedly willing to waive his no-movement clause for the right team.\n\nMangiapane has struggled this season, as evidenced by his five goals and 11 points in 42 games. Yet, when looking at his past success, there is reason to believe that he could bounce back in the right situation. From 2021-22 to 2023-24 with the Calgary Flames, Mangiapane recorded at least 40 points in each campaign. With this, he could be an intriguing player for the Sharks to buy low on.\n\nIf Mangiapane bounced back, he would have the potential to be a nice pickup for the Sharks' top nine and would also give them another option for their power play. He also has a $3.6 million cap hit until next season, so he would be more than a rental.",

    "fullText": "Atletico Madrid will be busy between now and the closing of the winter transfer window, as they seek reinforcements for Diego Simeone’s squad. The departures of Javi Galan, Conor Gallagher and Giacomo Raspadori mean that a new left, central midfielder and forward are needed, and currently, work is being done on each area.\n\nMidfield is the priority for the time being, but addressing defence and attack is equally important. For the latter, targets have already been identified, with the favourite having also been picked out.\n\nAs per Diario AS, Atleti are very keen on signing Lee Kang-in, and talks between the two clubs are already ongoing. Director of Football Mateu Alemany has been in Paris in recent days, and he took in Paris Saint-Germain’s 3-0 victory over Lille on Friday, a match that the South Korea international was not involved in.\n\nLee is currently sidelined with a minor injury, but he will be back in action before the end of the month. Atleti do not see his current absence as a stumbling block, which is they have made their move, and with good relations between themselves and PSG, it is hoped that an agreement can be reached in the coming days.\n\nPSG are counting on Lee, so it is far from certain that PSG will allow a deal to be done. If that is the case, Atleti are prepared to move for another Ligue 1 attack: Matias Fernandez-Pardo. As per Diario AS, Los Colchoneros have rekindled the interest they showed in the summer, with the feeling now being that a deal is much more achievable.\n\nIt will be interesting to see who Atleti end up with, but both players would be exciting additions to Simeone’s squad – certainly more so than Raspadori was in the summer.",

    "fullText": "It had been a couple quiet games offensively for Nat Martinez, so in the biggest matchup of the conference season thus far she and Naomi Panganiban roared to life in the San Diego State women’s basketball team’s 75-66 overtime win over the UNLV Lady Rebels on Saturday afternoon at Cox Pavilion.\n\nMartinez scored a season-high 19 points, with 17 coming after halftime, and Panganiban had a game-high 20 points on 7-for-11 shooting as the Aztecs (14-3, 8-0 Mountain West) took just the second-ever meeting of teams with 7-0 conference records in Mountain West history to take first place.\n\nSDSU allowed just one made basket by the Lady Rebels (12-6, 7-1) in overtime, forcing five turnovers and holding UNLV to just 1-for-5 shooting from the field, while punishing the hosts by feeding the ball inside. Bailey Barnhard scored all 6 of her points in overtime, while Martinez got open back-door to give the Aztecs a two-possession lead midway through the extra session.\n\nThe Aztecs came out of halftime hitting almost everything from beyond the arc, as Martinez opened the third quarter by nailing back to back triples. UNLV responded with an 8-0 run that put the hosts back in front, but Panganiban kept the offense rolling by starting SDSU’s biggest scoring run of regulation.\n\nFirst she canned a 3-pointer, then Martinez got free for a driving layup as Alyssa Jackson and Panganiban made back-to-back 3’s as part of an 11-0 run and 17-8 push to start the second half. The lead grew as large as 10 points twice in the fourth quarter on a Martinez driving score and a Panganiban jumper.\n\nBut UNLV, who have won the last four regular season Mountain West titles, put together a 10-0 run over a 1:42 stretch to retake the lead with 41 seconds remaining. Mariah Elohim made two of her three 3-pointers for the game during the stretch, with Lady Rebels leading scorer kicking the run off with her 16th of 18 points of the night on a transition layup.\n\nPanganiban nailed a triple with 41 seconds left to put SDSU back in front by 1, but the Aztecs fouled Jasmyn Lott on a fast break with 18 seconds remaining, but the guard split the pair at the free-throw line. SDSU had a chance to win the game in regulation when Kennedy Lee was fouled on a put back attempt after Nala Williams’ driving attempt missed.\n\nThe win extended the Aztecs streak to 10 in a row, and was the first win in a true road game at UNLV since the 2012-13 season. San Diego State is 5-0 on the road this season and are 15-4 on the road since the beginning of last year.\n\nUp next will have a bye during the midweek round of Mountain West games, returning to action against the San José State Spartans on Saturday, Jan. 24. Tip-off is scheduled for 1 p.m. and the game will be streamed on the Mountain West Network.",

    "fullText": "All signs are Sam Darnold will start the Seahawks’ first playoff game.\n\nQuestionable to play because of an oblique injury he felt in practice Thursday, the Pro Bowl quarterback was on the field throwing as usual in full pads for pregame warmups about 45 minutes before the Seahawks hosted the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC divisional playoffs at Lumen Field Saturday night.\n\nDarnold threw a couple initial passes. He then windmilled his arms to loosen up before resuming his normal pregame routine. Darnold increased his throws to 25 yards, not throwing particularly hard and more lofting his passes.\n\nWhen the team went to 11 on 11 drills, Darnold was running the starting offense, as usual. He threw passes to Jason Smith-Njigba and other starters. He wasn’t throwing all that hard, because he didn’t have to yet, still a half hour before kickoff.\n\nDarnold had not been on the field during early pregame warmups about an hour earlier. Drew Lock threw to Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Cooper Kupp, AJ Barner and Seattle’s starting receivers. Rookie Jalen Milroe threw to reserves.\n\nThen the team issued their inactive players 90 minutes before kickoff, per NFL rules. Darnold was active to play. Milroe was inactive and the emergency third quarterback, as usual.\n\nDarnold and Lock being the team’s active quarterbacks was a sign the Seahawks were either waiting closer to kickoff to test Darnold’s oblique injury which had him questionable to play, or that he’d already tested it and they’d made their determination. “It’s just something he’s never experienced before,” Seahawks general manager John Schneider said on the team’s radio pregame show.\n\n“I think it’s just more precautionary stuff going on.\n\n“Luckily our medical staff (experienced) with it. And we move on.”",

    "title": "Arizona women’s basketball pushes No. 10 TCU but falls short in 2nd half",
    "description": "Sumayah Sugapong and Achol Magot had big games for the Wildcats",
    "fullText": "As the Arizona women’s basketball team prepared to go on the road and face No. 10 TCU, head coach Becky Burke said that the Wildcats weren’t going to Fort Worth with the idea that they were already beaten. That was despite losing leading scorer Micky Perdue just over a week ago.\n\n“What an opportunity for some other people to step up, what an opportunity for us to go get a couple wins…when there’s not one person outside this building that thinks that’s gonna happen,” Burke said on Wednesday.\n\nThe Wildcats showed that mindset from the jump, forcing TCU into 8 turnovers in the first quarter and turning those into 9 points. They didn’t back down, and after 20 minutes they were up 30-28 and had become the first opponent to lead at the half in Schollmaier Arena since Feb. 23, 2024. TCU picked it up over the final 15 minutes of the game to survive with a 78-62 victory.\n\n“We can go…and say we threw some punches because we gave it our all,” Burke said. “We fought, we battled, we followed a game plan to perfection that I think was really, really effective. TCU is a great team, well coached. We respected them at the highest level coming into this game, but we didn’t come in here like we were planning on losing, and I was really proud of our team’s effort for that, in our fight, in the situation that we’re in this year, and with losing our leading scorer…There’s a lot of things that our team could be down and out about, and they are not and they’re fighting and they’re battling, and just probably as proud as I’ve sat at a podium despite a loss.”\n\nSumayah Sugapong led the way, scoring 11 points in the first quarter. She ended the game with 17 points, 4 rebounds, 4 assists, 1 block, and 3 steals. She was also one of two Arizona players called for technical fouls after making big plays. Those led to four TCU points.\n\n“In a game like this, where we’re sort of the underdog, I think that’s where a lot of us thrive, just coming in competing,” Sugapong said. “I was talking about, really no pressure on us coming into this game. So just going out there, playing hard, and sometimes emotions take over a little bit too much.”\n\nGoing into the week, Burke said that this game would be a prime opportunity for Achol Magot. The 6-foot-7 center would be needed against the 6-foot-7 pair of Clara Silva and Kennedy Basham. It worked. Basham fouled out in eight minutes without scoring.\n\nMagot made her biggest impact in the third quarter. She had six points and three rebounds while drawing several fouls on Silva and Basham. She ended the game with 12 points, 7 rebounds, and 1 assist. She hit 4 of her 8 shots and went 4 for 5 from the free throw line. Most importantly, she had just 3 fouls in 16 minutes of play and was even diving to the floor to get to 50-50 balls.\n\n“Achol had an interesting week, but she was ready when her number was called,” Burkes said. “And I’m just going to continue to challenge Achol to practice hard, to play hard, to be ready for opportunities. Because, you know, she looks a little bit different than anybody else on our team. She looks like the opposing post players, and from a size, physicality standpoint, we do need her presence. This is by far her best game. She was able to play 16 minutes. We haven’t gotten that out of her. She was able to get out there and contribute in a way that she hasn’t so far this season, and we’re going to need that in the second half of Big 12 play. So excited for her to gain that confidence today and build off of it.”\n\nIt wasn’t enough, though. TCU started to pull away halfway through the third quarter. The Horned Frogs were up by eight with 3:37 left in the frame and had a seven-point lead after 30 minutes.\n\nThey kept that momentum in the fourth. Arizona didn’t score over the first 3.5 minutes of the final quarter while TCU hit one after another. The lead hit double digits with 8:49 left in the game and was up to 18 by the time Arizona scored.\n\nLani Cornfield was the third Wildcat with double-figure scoring. She ended with 11 points, 4 rebounds, 5 assists, and 1 block. The block was followed by what the official deemed was an unsportsmanlike stare down, and she picked up Arizona’s second technical foul of the day. It was her fifth foul.\n\nBlessing ‘Adde’ Adebanjo also fouled out for Arizona, but she made an impact before doing so. She scored 9 points on 4-of-5 shooting, grabbed 1 rebound, dished out 1 assist, and had 1 steal in 15 minutes on the court.\n\nArizona will return home to face Kansas on Tuesday, Jan. 20 at 6 p.m. MST. The Wildcats will try to grab their second Big 12 win after losing their last home game to UCF just 24 hours after learning Perdue would not play. They now stand at 10-7 and 1-5 in conference play.\n\nTCU improved to 18-1 and 6-1 in Big 12 play. They earned a share of the Big 12 lead after Kansas State upset No. 17 Texas Tech in Lubbock earlier in the day.",

    "fullText": "Augsburg striker Michael Gregoritsch has commented on what it felt like to return to the Bundesliga so much sooner than expected with one of his old clubs. The Austrian international unfortunately didn’t make much of a mark in Thursday night’s 1-1 draw with Union Berlin beyond accidentally colliding with FCU captain Rani Khedira early. It was nevertheless an emotional occasion for the 31-year-old.\n\n“I felt so sorry,” Gregoritsch remarked in the WWK Arena mixed zone. “I really wanted to avoid him, but he ran into me. I thought he was blocking me, but then he suddenly turned away. Rani is one of my closest friends in football. You can see that I apologized immediately. It was also uncomfortable for me because I didn’t mean to do it. I apologized throughout the entire game and promised Rani our next meal is on me.“\n\nWith his new club fighting relegation, Gregoritsch wished to make clear that he knew precisely what was expected of him. Despite the fact that both he and the Fuggerstädter haven’t gotten off to very good start in 2026 (a bad loss against Borussia Mönchengladbach and the points dropped against Union), Gregoritsch emphasized that he felt things would trend upward.\n\n“I really missed the Bundesliga and am so happy to be back here,” Gregoritsch said. “[coming back from Denmark] I’ve had a longer winter break and not much training rime. One can see that the team is a little unsettled, but they are basically good guys with a lot of quality. As one of the old guys, it’s my job to help. We’re getting better and I’m optimistic.”\n\nFCA head coach Manuel Baum appeared to suggest so at his Friday pre-match press conference. Even though the Thursday Bundesliga fixture leaves the team on a tight turnaround, Baum stressed that he wanted to build a consistent squad.\n\n“There may be some changes, but I’m less in favor of rotating because I believe we need a core,” Baum said. “There are a few here with a Freiburg past. With regard to ‘Gregerl,’ I asked him today and he said he feels really good. So it’s possible that he’ll start again.“",

    "fullText": "Ben Johnson gives credit for the Bears' success to veteran backup QB originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThis season is the best for the Chicago Bears in quite some time, as they finished the regular season 11-6, winning the NFC North, and have the chance to reach the NFC championship game if they can defeat the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday night.\n\nMany people have stated the reasons they believe the Bears have had a franchise-altering season, such as the hiring of head coach Ben Johnson and the rise of second-year quarterback Caleb Williams. Both have, without a doubt, had a significant positive impact on the team.\n\nHowever, Johnson gave an unlikely reason for the team's success this season: a player who has been in the league for a long time.\n\nMore: Bears' Colston Loveland is 2nd in NFL history with crazy stats, joining Gronk with this record\n\nVeteran backup quarterback Case Keenum received high praise from his head coach for the role he has played this season for Chicago, despite not taking any snaps with the team.\n\n\"He's been tremendous in terms of Caleb's growth. That was really the thought process of bringing him in, a guy with skins on the wall. He's played in big games himself at a high level. He's won big games. He's lost big games. His experience has really been something that all these young players can really lean into,\" Johnson said to the media on Friday.\n\nJohnson makes a great point as Keenum has seen it all in his 13 seasons in the league and has been a servicable backup for most of his years, so even though it doesn't sound ideal, it shouldn't be as surprising that this young Bears team has leaned on the veteran.\n\nKeenum's leadership will be needed for at least one game against one of his former teams, the Rams, which is set to be the team's most formidable opponent yet.\n\nCaleb Williams fires back at Packers’ super fan Lil Wayne after wild tweet\n\nChicago Bears now know who they will face in divisional round of playoffs\n\nBears, Bills, Rams set an NFL playoff record already with crazy comeback history\n\nCaleb Williams planted an image in Packers fans' heads that will haunt them all offseason\n\nCaleb Williams gets emotional paying tribute to Ben Johnson after Bears' playoff win",

    "fullText": "DETROIT -- Isaiah Jackson knew as soon as he took an elbow from Boston center Neemias Queta on Dec. 22 that he had a problem and that it was probably a concussion.\n\nJackson said he also took a hit to the head in a previous game that might have been a concussion but wasn't sure. But Queta hit him hard twice with elbows, and by the time he got to the locker room in Boston, he knew for sure he had one and he wasn't going to be playing for awhile.\n\n\"I knew then that I had one and that I should just chill,\" Jackson said. \"When it happened I went back to the locker room and I was throwing up and stuff and my head was hurting. The next day, it just kept getting worse and worse and worse. It was a process. I didn't know it was going to be as severe as it was. I thought it was going to be a one- or two-day thing and then I'd be good. But it took a long time.\"\n\nIt was well into the new year before Jackson was cleared to return to basketball activities and after about a week of conditioning he was cleared to play in Saturday's game against the Pistons near his home town of Pontiac, Mich. Jackson said he experienced just about every symptom one could expect while dealing with a concussion.\n\n\"Headaches,\" Jackson said. \"Fogginess. My thoughts were foggy. ... My symptoms were severe. Light sensitivity. Sound sensitivity. I couldn't even be around. I was bad. I was literally just in my room the blinds were shut. I had sunglasses on. It was bad.\"\n\nJackson said he's had about a week and a half to work on conditioning. He said he's good to play but not 100%.\n\n\"I'm in a good spot,\" Jackson said. \"I'm not where I was, but I'm getting there.\"\n\nDustin Dopirak covers the Pacers all season.

Allen and Nix will continue this battle with their playoff lives on the line.\n\nThe winner goes to the AFC Championship.\n\n7:43 p.m. FIELD GOAL: Allen misses Knox for a potential game-winning touchdown, but Prater comes in clutch and drills the game-tying field goal.\n\nThis crazy game looks to be heading to overtime.\n\n7:39 p.m.: The Bills OC Joe Brady pulls out the hook and ladder with the game on the line, and they pick up 27 yards.\n\nBuffalo is in field goal range with 24 seconds left.\n\n7:37 p.m.: On a 3rd and one, Allen was able to get the Broncos to jump offside.\n\n37 seconds to go, and a field goal ties the game.\n\n7:35 p.m.: On the first play of the last drive, Allen pulls out some heroics as he pitches it forward to avoid a strip.\n\nThe Bills call a timeout with a 2nd and one.\n\n7:34 p.m. TOUCHDOWN: Nix with ice in his veins delivers a 26-yard touchdown pass to Marvin Mims.\n\nMARVIN MIMS JR. FOR THE LEAD\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/KxgLMR7wvr\n\nMims steps up with two wide receivers out for the Broncos.

They are now at the Buffalo 38-yard line, with a chance to win the game at the two-minute warning.\n\nSutton on 3rd-and-11 🔥\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/01s4CnZUFX\n\n7:20 p.m. FIELD GOAL: The Bills think they might've scored a touchdown but it gets ruled incomplete. However, Buffalo still manages to get some points and extend the lead off of Prater's foot.\n\n7:16 p.m.: Allen puts the city of Buffalo on his back and picks up a first down to keep the drive alive and continue milking the clock.\n\n7:04 p.m.: Bills' defense forces a stop and gives the ball right back to Allen. The Broncos' defense will need to step up to prevent the Bills from adding to their lead.\n\n6:57 p.m. TOUCHDOWN: Allen delivers a dime to his TE to take their first lead since the 1st quarter. The Bills erase a 13-point deficit, and now the pressure falls right back on the Broncos and Nix.\n\nDALTON KINCAID WHAT A CATCH TO TIE IT\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/y4wUrQgjb5\n\n6:56 p.m.: Allen is able to connect with Khalil Shakir for a 46-yard completion. This is now the longest play the Bills have had during this game.\n\n6:45 p.m.: The Buffalo defense is emptying the tank when it comes to pressures on Nix. The Broncos are unable to capitalize on their second Allen turnover of the half and punt the ball right back to the Bills.\n\nPayton elected to attempt to pin the Bills deep rather than extend their lead.\n\n6:40 p.m.: Allen once again gives the ball to the Broncos as he forces a ball into double coverage. P.J. Locke takes the ball right back for his squad and bails out his young quarterback.\n\nP.J.

Kincaid takes the pass for a 25-yard gain, which also marks the longest completion for the Bills to this point.\n\nAllen then goes right back to Kincaid to set up a third and short, followed by a tush push for a first down.\n\n6:23 p.m. FIELD GOAL: Buffalo's defense bails them out and holds the Broncos to a field goal after yet again working with a short field. Lutz has been busy and drills another short field goal.\n\nDenver now leads by 13, and Allen will need to show some of that playoff magic if the Bills are to come back against this defensive unit.\n\n6:20 p.m.: History is against the Bills, and the fumble on their opening drive of the second half is not going to help.\n\nThe Bills are 2-13 in the playoffs in franchise history when trailing at halftime.\n\nThey’re down 20-10 in Denver at half after the Broncos scored 10 in the final 30 seconds. pic.twitter.com/y21jeFHLwP\n\n— ESPN (@espn) January 17, 2026\n\n6:18 p.m.: Ball security issues continue for the Bills as Allen is sacked and stripped. Three turnovers in five drives for the Bills and two fumbles in three snaps.\n\nThe Broncos are in a prime position to extend the lead they built.\n\n6:06 p.m.: After the Bills scored the game's first touchdown and then got the ball right back, Denver fans may have been nervous. However, Buffalo has two fumbles that the Broncos not only recovered, but scored points off.\n\nThe Broncos could not have had a better end to the first half, scoring 10 points in 22 seconds. Buffalo will start with the ball, and Allen will look to make up for the costly fumble.\n\n6:00 p.m. FIELD GOAL: After a disastrous fumble by Allen with the half winding down, the Broncos took advantage of it and extended their lead.\n\nBroncos ball!\n\nWhat a break before the half 😳\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/317eodiE90\n\nDenver scored 10 points in the final 22 seconds of the first half.\n\n5:58 p.m. TOUCHDOWN: Nix looked sharp in the two-minute drill, throwing several strikes and picking up yards with his legs.\n\nRedemption for Lil'Jordan Humphrey!\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/2fGMhIkwyb\n\nNix then launched a beautiful 29-yard touchdown to Humphrey to take the lead once again against the Bills. Humphrey dropped a touchdown in the first quarter, but made up for it\n\n5:53 p.m.: The Broncos will be without Pat Bryant after leaving the game with three catches on the game's opening drive.\n\nTroy Franklin is also questionable to return with a hamstring injury. The Broncos will now have to heavily rely on Sutton and Mims, who are already banged up.\n\n5:46 p.m.: Broncos are able to cross midfield with under a minute to go in the half. Nix once again rushed for a first down.\n\nBo scrambling!\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/UcPe85ot1F\n\nDenver is driving and looking to score before halftime.\n\n5:36 p.m. FIELD GOAL: The Bills were unable to answer the Broncos' touchdown with one of their own, but they managed to tie the game with a 33-yard field goal made by Matt Prater.\n\n5:34 p.m.: The Bills put together a good drive on a 24-yard pass to Cook, then faced some adversity after a sack made it 2nd and long.\n\nBeautiful route by the veteran Brandin Cooks on third down\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/8ysFSIOAtr\n\nHowever, Allen connected with Bradin Cooks for a 15-yard pass to keep the drive alive.\n\n5:25 p.m. TOUCHDOWN: Denver makes the most of the Cook fumble and scores on some trickery. Frank Crum, the offensive tackle, caught a touchdown pass from Bo Nix.\n\nFRANK CRUM BIG MAN TD\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/8SEiIm527H\n\nThe Broncos take the lead off of some creativity from Sean Payton.\n\n5:17 p.m.: Cook was drilled by Alex Singleton and fumbled the ball. The Broncos recovered it, and now Denver has excellent field position.\n\nBroncos ball! Alex Singleton forces the fumble 😳\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/msSHg9AKXj\n\nThis marks Cook's fourth fumble of the season which is tied for the most among other RBs.\n\nThat fumble was James Cook's fourth of the year, including regular season, most among RBs, and one more than he had in his first three seasons combined, per @ESPNInsights.\n\n— Alaina Getzenberg (@agetzenberg) January 17, 2026\n\n5:15 p.m.: Allen scrambles for a 25-yard run, Buffalo dominating on the ground. They've already picked up 75 yards on only 10 carries.\n\n5:11 p.m.: The Broncos are unable to do anything on their second drive of the game. Courtland Sutton nearly made a diving catch on third down, but it was ruled incomplete.\n\nThe Bills will send Allen and company back onto the field, looking to extend their lead.\n\n5:07 p.m.: At the end of one, both offenses had promising opening drives, but only one was able to capitalize with six. Cook was spectacular on the Bills' first drive, as was Allen.\n\nThe Broncos fumbled on the final play of the opening quarter but recovered. It will be 2 and 10 after the break for Denver\n\n5:04 p.m. TOUCHDOWN: With Cook and Allen dominating Denver with the ground game, Allen only needed to complete four passes.\n\nMecole Hardman playoff TDs are back!\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/CWy8FUMSXh\n\nAllen was able to complete a 4-yard pass to Mecole Hardman to put the Bills on top just before the opening quarter is about to end.\n\n4:55 p.m.: Pat Surtain looked shaken up and is heading towards the blue medical tent. The Broncos certainly cannot afford to lose their all-pro corner.\n\n4:54 p.m.: After having a technical issue with his helmet, Allen was forced to call a timeout. Allen changed his helmet and is now set to go.\n\n4:53 p.m.: James Cook picks up a chunk play on the first play for the Buffalo Bills on offense. Cook picked up 24 yards on his first carry.\n\n24 yards from James Cook on the Bills' first offensive snap!\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/T1PX6LlBOZ\n\n4:50 p.m. FIELD GOAL: After a dropped touchdown by Lil'Jordan Humphrey, the Broncos have to settle for a field goal in the red zone. Will Lutz drilled the 28-yarder to open up the scoring.\n\n4:49 p.m.: The Broncos were fortunate that a fumble was overturned due to an offside by the Bills.\n\n4:46 p.m.: On 4th down, the Broncos once again run Nix, and he picks up the first down. The Broncos' offense had picked up four first downs on this drive.\n\n4:43 p.m.: After a completion for a first down on the first throw of the game, Jaleel McLaughlin showed incredible effort to gain five yards. Pat Bryant, who had three catches on the opening drive, was a bit shaken up.\n\nOn the first third down for the Broncos, Nix keeps it for a 5-yard run and first down. The Broncos are driving into Buffalo territory on the opening drive.\n\nBo had the defense fooled on the read option\n\nBUFvsDEN on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/ljd2CTiyI6\n\n4:35 p.m.: Bills' Dorian Williams on special teams was in a huge collision on the opening kickoff and is down, injury timeout in Denver.\n\nThe entire Bills team has come off the sideline to check on Dorian Williams. He is able to get up and come off the field supported by Bills staff.\n\n— Alaina Getzenberg (@agetzenberg) January 17, 2026\n\n4:33 p.m.: The Bills have deferred, which means Bo Nix and the Broncos offense will take the field first.\n\n4:20 p.m.: Josh Allen firing up his guys before they take the field at Denver. Allen is 8-1 in playoff games when he doesn't play Patrick Mahomes or Joe Burrow.\n\n“Find a way to get it done.” - @JoshAllenQB@DriveToyota | #BillsMafiapic.twitter.com/amaL8KgNCI\n\n— Buffalo Bills (@BuffaloBills) January 17, 2026\n\n4:18 p.m.: Almost that time from Mile High.\n\nPlayoff mode. 🔒#BUFvsDENpic.twitter.com/v2khU1REG7\n\n— Denver Broncos (@Broncos) January 17, 2026\n\n4:08 p.m.: Several members of the Denver Broncos Super Bowl 50 winning team are in attendance, cheering on their former organization.\n\nFeels like a Super Bowl 50 reunion at Broncos-Bills.

    "fullText": "Editor's note: See live coverage of the Buffalo Bills vs. Denver Broncos AFC divisional playoff game here, and return to USA TODAY \n\nThe NFL playoff bracket began with 14 teams and five weeks to determine this year's champion at Super Bowl 60 in Santa Clara in February. There was always a chance that not every postseason game would be decided in four quarters.\n\nThe divisional round is providing NFL fans with their first look at overtime in the 2025 postseason. The Buffalo Bills forced OT against the Denver Broncos with a late field goal by Matt Prater.\n\nThis marks the sixth overtime playoff game in the last six seasons.\n\nHere's what to know about the overtime rules in the NFL playoffs:\n\nIf the score is tied after regulation, there's another coin toss. Here's what the rules are:\n\nThe overtime period is 15 minutes long.\n\nIt is 10 minutes in the regular season.\n\nEach team gets three timeouts per half (two overtime periods).\n\nEach team will have a possession, but the game does not automatically end if the first team scores a touchdown.\n\nIf the score is still tied after each team gets one possession, the next score wins.\n\nAn exception is made if the team that first possesses the ball commits a safety. The kickoff team wins in this scenario, the same as in the regular season.\n\nExtra points are not attempted if the game ends in a touchdown.\n\nAll replays are initiated by the replay official and not by the coach's challenge.\n\nWild card round: Saturday, Jan. 10 to Monday, Jan. 12, 2026\n\nDivisional round: Saturday, Jan. 17 to Sunday, Jan. 18, 2026\n\nConference championship: Sunday, Jan. 25, 2026\n\nSuper Bowl: Sunday, Feb. 8, 2026\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: NFL overtime rules: What are OT rules in playoffs?",

    "description": "Oregon men's basketball point guard Jackson Shelstad will potentially have season-ending surgery on his hand, coach Dana Altman said.",
    "fullText": "Oregon will likely be without point guard Jackson Shelstad for the rest of the season.\n\nCoach Dana Altman said after the Ducks lost 81-71 to Michigan on Jan. 17 — the fourth straight missed game for Shelstad — that tests taken on Friday revealed tendon and ligament damage in his right hand and it may require surgery, the recovery time for which is six to eight weeks.\n\n\"If he has to have surgery, it'll be the season,\" Altman said. \"So, I'm sure that we won't have him the rest of the year. There will be a decision made next week on surgery ... but there's just some tendon and ligament damage, it looks like, that hasn't healed.\"\n\nShelstad injured his hand against Omaha on Dec. 28 and has been sitting out ever since.\n\nThe three-year starter and an all-Big-Ten Conference preseason selection, is second on the team in scoring at 15.6 points per game and leads the Ducks in assists (59) and steals (17).\n\nHe missed the first game of the season as he recovered from surgery after breaking his right hand in a preseason practice. Altman reiterated Saturday that Shelstad's current injury is not related to his injury or surgery from last fall.\n\nOregon was also without starting center Nate Bittle against Michigan. The Ducks' leading scorer was on the bench with a boot on his left foot. Bittle used a scooter to move around without putting pressure on what Altman labeled a \"lower leg\" injury that Bittle suffered Tuesday at Nebraska.\n\nForward Sean Stewart said the team recently held a players-only meeting to address the loss of their top two players and how to move forward.\n\n\"We basically said, everybody's just got to come together, next man up,\" Stewart said. \"Nobody plays less hard against us because Nate and Jackson are out, so we just have to play harder than ever.\"\n\nChris Hansen covers University of Oregon football, men’s basketball, track and field, cross country and softball for The Register-Guard.

    "description": "Join Mile High Report to discuss the action from this Divisional Round game between the Denver Broncos and Buffalo Bills.",
    "fullText": "The AFC’s top seeded Denver Broncos (14-3) will host the Buffalo Bills (13-5) in the Divisional Round of the NFL Playoffs. The action around the country is centered around Josh Allen and his quest for a championship, but very little attention has been paid to the rise of these Broncos from castaway to AFC powerhouse. Can they send Allen and the Bills packing and punch their ticket to the AFC Championship Game? We certainly hope so!\n\nKickoff is set for 2:30 p.m. Mile High time on Saturday, January 17, 2026 at Empower Field at Mile High in Denver, Colorado. You can watch the live stream of the game through FuboTV or on CBS. The game will be called by Jim Nantz (play-by-play), Tony Romo (analyst), and Tracy Wolfson (sideline). You can also check local Broncos radio network affiliate stations.\n\nEverything we have on this game\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nAccording to FanDuel, the Broncos opened as slight home underdogs, but are now slightly favored over the Bills at 1.5-points. I still feel like they will need to be the overdogs in this game and come out with a win. While the odds have them slightly favored, no one else nationally are picking them to win really. I hope for a good old fashioned beat down, but that hasn’t been their style all season long. Give me another hard-fought, climb higher type win.\n\nPrediction: Broncos 24, Bills 22.\n\nA look at how the Denver Broncos went from giving up 70 points in Miami in 2023 … to being the AFC’s No. 1 seed this season.\n\nProduced by @AjayAtayee and Ellis Williams. pic.twitter.com/6Cqg31nuMr\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) January 17, 2026\n\nBo making it look easy.\n\nBUFvsDEN– 4:30pm ET on CBS/Paramount+\nStream on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/SCIvhKbbcU\n\nFeels like a Super Bowl 50 reunion at Broncos-Bills.

    "fullText": "Irrespective of your programming language of choice, calling C functions is often a necessity. For the longest time, the only standard way to call C was the Java Native Interface (JNI). But it was so painful that few dared to do it. I have heard it said that it was deliberately painful so that people would be enticed to use pure Java as much as possible.\n\nSince Java 22, there is a new approach called the Foreign Function & Memory API in java.lang.foreign. Let me go through step by step.\n\nYou need a Linker and a SymbolLookup instance from which you will build a MethodHandle that will capture the native function you want to call.\n\nTo load the SymbolLookup instance for your library (called mylibrary), you may do so as follows:\n\nThe native library file should be on your java.library.path path, or somewhere on the default library paths. (You can pass it to your java executable as -Djava.library.path=something).\n\nAlternatively, you can use SymbolLookup.libraryLookup or other means of loading\n\nthe library, but System.loadLibrary should work well enough.\n\nYou have the lookup, you can grab the address of a function like so:\n\nThis returns an Optional<MemorySegment>. You can grab the MemorySegment like so:\n\nOnce you have your MemorySegment, you can pass it to your linker to get a MethodHandle which is close to a callable function:\n\nThe functiondescr must describe the returned value and the function parameters that your function takes.\n\nIf you pass a pointer and get back a long value, you might proceed as follows:\n\nThat is, the first parameter is the returned value.\n\nFor function returning nothing, you use FunctionDescriptor.ofVoid.\n\nThe MethodHandle can be called almost like a normal Java function:\n\nmyfunc.invokeExact(parameters). It always returns an Object which means that if it should return a long, it will return a Long. So a cast might be necessary.\n\nYou can allocate C data structures from Java that you can pass to your native code by using an Arena. Let us say that you want to create an instance like\n\nYou could do it in this manner:\n\nYou can then pass myseg as a pointer to a data structure in C.\n\nYou often get an array with a try clause like so:\n\nThere are many types of arenas: confined, global, automatic, shared. The confined arenas are accessible from a single thread. A shared or global arena is accessible from several threads. The global and automatic arenas are managed by the Java garbage collector whereas the confined and shared arenas are managed explicitly, with a specific lifetime.\n\nSo, it is fairly complicated but manageable. Is it fast? To find out, I call from Java a C library I wrote with support for binary fuse filters. They are a fast alternative to Bloom filters.\n\nYou don’t need to know what any of this means, however. Keep in mind that I wrote a Java library called jfusebin which calls a C library. Then I also have a pure Java implementation and I can compare the speed.\n\nI should first point out that even if calling the C function did not include any overhead, it might still be slower because the Java compiler is unlikely to inline a native function. However, if you have a pure Java function, and it is relatively small, it can get inlined and you get all sorts of nice optimizations like constant folding and so forth.\n\nThus I can overestimate the cost of the overhead. But that’s ok. I just want a ballpark measure.\n\nIn my benchmark, I check for the presence of a key in a set. I have one million keys in the filter. I can ask whether a key is not present in the filter.\n\nI find that the library calling C can issue 44 million calls per second using the 8-bit binary fuse filter. I reach about 400 million calls per second using the pure Java implementation.\n\nThus I measure an overhead of about 20 ns per C function calls from Java using a macBook (M4 processor).\n\nObviously, in my case, because the Java library is so fast, the 20 ns becomes too much. But it is otherwise a reasonable overhead.\n\nDaniel Lemire, \"A new way to call C from Java: how fast is it?,\" in Daniel Lemire's blog, January 17, 2026, https://lemire.me/blog/2026/01/17/a-new-way-to-call-c-from-java-how-fast-is-it/.\r\n [BibTeX]",

    "description": "Your lead engineer thinks 10 AWS accounts is overkill. Here's why starting clean is weeks of work, while untangling later is 6-12 months of migration pain.",
    "fullText": "\"We don't need 10+ AWS accounts. It's overkill for us—we can do this later after we launch. This will slow down product development and add unnecessary complexity.\"\n\nI've heard this pushback dozens of times. And here's the thing: the instincts behind it aren't wrong.\n\nIt can feel like over-investing in infrastructure too early. It is more accounts than most people new to AWS start with. And if you've used multi-account setups before without good tooling, they absolutely can feel cumbersome and slow.\n\nOn top of that, understanding someone else's infrastructure code is always harder than code you wrote yourself, and you don't even know the final product architecture yet—shipping the product has to be the priority.\n\nThe counterproposal usually sounds reasonable:\n\n\"We just need dev, staging, and production accounts. Anything more is unnecessary complexity.\"\n\nHere's the thing: this is correct. To operate any product on AWS, you need a minimum of one account per SDLC stage—dev, staging, production. That's the baseline.\n\nThe misunderstanding comes when you look at this holistically: what does the organization need to operate securely? There's more than your software at stake.\n\nThe \"three accounts\" view only considers the application. It ignores everything else the organization needs to function—and that's where it breaks down the moment you start asking concrete questions.\n\nIf they're centralized—and they should be for security, compliance, and tamper resistance—they can't live in dev/staging/prod. Hence an audit account.\n\nWhere does your container registry live?\n\nIf you rebuild container images per account, you're triplicating images and not running what you tested. If you promote artifacts—which you should—a shared account is the logical solution. Hence an artifacts account.\n\nIn every account? That's 3× the cost and operational overhead. If centralized, how do they securely talk to services across accounts? Hence an automation account and a transit gateway. Don't think you need self-hosted runners? Make sure you have other ways to manage Kubernetes and RDS databases on private subnets.\n\nNone of these are future-state problems—they show up fast.\n\nWhen you put it all together—answering each of those concrete questions—you end up with:\n\nThat's 9–10 accounts for a minimal level of isolation.\n\nNot because someone decided \"9–10 is the right number.\" Because each account answers a specific question that you'll have to answer anyway. The accounts aren't arbitrary—they're the natural result of thinking through where things actually need to live.\n\nDoes this seem like a lot? Consider what happens without these boundaries:\n\nThe accounts aren't bureaucracy. They're guardrails that let you move faster, not slower.\n\nHere's the thing: you can add accounts later. That's not the myth.\n\nThe myth is believing it's easy or cheap to do later. It's not.\n\nAdding accounts later requires complex migrations, scheduling and coordination across teams, and untangling months or years of decisions built on faulty assumptions—like CIDR allocations that don't support peering or future growth.\n\nSome accounts are genuinely optional. If you're never going to have self-hosted runners, skip the automation account. If you're never using AWS as a DNS registrar, skip the DNS account. No big deal.\n\nBut some decisions are foundational—and brutal to change later:\n\nThe accounts themselves might sit empty for a while. But the architectural decisions you make on day one—CIDR allocation strategy, naming conventions, network topology—those get baked in immediately.\n\nHere's the real message: unless you operate today like you'll have multiple accounts, adding more accounts later won't make a difference.\n\nYou need to instill multi-account practices now in how you architect your applications and base your assumptions. It affects everything: network CIDR allocations, naming conventions, S3 bucket naming, Terraform state storage, DNS architecture, IAM trust relationships.\n\nCreate the boundaries now. Use them as the problems present themselves. If you wait until you need them, you're not just creating accounts—you're untangling everything you built assuming they didn't exist.\n\nThere's another reason account boundaries matter that's easy to underestimate:\n\nVPCs only give you network isolation. Accounts are the only hard IAM boundary AWS gives you.\n\nIf your goal is developer autonomy—letting engineers move fast without stepping on each other—fewer accounts actually makes that harder, not easier.\n\nYou end up either doing fragile IAM gymnastics, or giving everyone administrative access—which is very hard to walk back. Clean account boundaries let devs have broad access in some places and almost none in others—especially around production and security.\n\nAnd here's the uncomfortable truth: nothing is harder to craft than IAM policies.\n\nGetting IAM right in a single-account setup where you need to simulate multi-account boundaries is exponentially more complex than just having the boundaries in the first place.\n\nThis might look like over-engineering. It's not—it's choosing where to pay the cost.\n\nHere's the key: it's only complicated if you don't have the right tooling, conventions, and a framework that ties it together.\n\nWith the right tooling (like Atmos), managing 10 accounts isn't harder than managing 3. The complexity objection assumes you're doing this manually or piecing it together yourself. A proper framework handles the multi-account orchestration for you.\n\nSimple account setups optimize for getting started. Multi-account setups optimize for not having to unlearn assumptions later.\n\nYou're not adding complexity. You're preventing it.\n\nThe complexity of multi-team access, centralized logging, artifact promotion, and network segmentation is coming whether you plan for it or not. The only question is whether you have clean boundaries when it arrives, or whether you're retrofitting them into a single-account monolith.\n\nI genuinely understand the pushback. The instinct to ship fast and avoid premature complexity is exactly right in most contexts.\n\nBut AWS account boundaries aren't premature complexity—they're deferred simplicity. The complexity exists regardless. The only question is whether you've given it clean places to live.\n\nStarting clean is weeks. Untangling later is months.\n\nIf you're navigating this conversation internally and want help making the case—or just want to talk through the tradeoffs with someone who's been there—talk to an engineer. No sales theater. Just engineers who understand both the technical reality and the organizational dynamics at play.",

    "fullText": "Umarell (Italian spelling of the Bolognese Emilian word umarèl, Emilian pronunciation: [umaˈrɛːl]; plural umarî) are men of retirement age who spend their time watching construction sites, especially roadworks – stereotypically with hands clasped behind their back and offering unrequested advice to the workers.[1] Its literal meaning is \"little man\" (also umaréin).[2] The term is employed as lighthearted mockery or self-deprecation.\n\nThe modern term was popularised in 2005 by local writer Danilo Masotti[3][4] through three books and an associated blog.[5][6] The word was included in the Italian Zingarelli dictionary in 2021[7][8][9][10][11] and in 2024 was included by Language Council of Sweden in the annual list of new Swedish words – the Språkrådets nyordslista [sv].[12][13]\n\nIn 2015, the city of Riccione, approximately 130 kilometres (80 miles) southeast of Bologna, allocated an €11,000 budget to pay a wage to umarells to oversee worksites in the city – counting the number of trucks in and out to ensure materials were delivered/removed according to the receipts, and guarding against theft when the site was otherwise unattended.[14] The town of San Lazzaro di Savena, 6 km (3+1⁄2 mi) to the South-East of Bologna, awarded the \"Umarell of the year\" prize to a local resident, Franco Bonini.[15][16]\n\nIn 2016, the local cultural association called Succede solo a Bologna (\"It only happens in Bologna\") released the \"Umarèl card\" as a fundraiser for continued restoration of the San Petronio church.[17][18] Separately, a mobile app called Umarells was released that tracked the location of ongoing roadworks and construction sites.[19][20] The fast food restaurant chain Burger King also \"hired\" several umarells as part of a social media marketing campaign promoting its increased presence in the country.[21]\n\nIn July 2017, the Bologna city council's \"consultative commission for street naming\" approved the naming of a public square to the East of the city centre in the Cirenaica district Piazzetta degli Umarells in recognition of the local fame of the concept and the name – noting with conscious irony that the square was under construction at the time.[22][23][24][25]\n\nIn April 2018, the public square was inaugurated by city councillor Matteo Lepore, the district president Simone Borsari, the \"lord of the umarells\" Franco Bonini, the stand-up comedian Maurizio Pagliari (Dulio Pizzocchi), and the writer Danilo Masotti.[26] A year later the street-sign for the square was stolen.[27]\n\nIn April 2020, the comic magazine Topolino dedicated an episode to the umarell Gerindo Persichetti.[28] In December 2020 in Pescara, the real estate developer Sarra installed windows to allow Umarells to observe three construction sites.[29][30] Since 2019, an annual calendar has been sold in Bologna newsstands. In 2021, a board game La Giornata dell’Umarell (An Umarell's Day) was released.[31]\n\nHaving officially entered the Swedish language in 2024,[13] in October 2025 the municipality of Karlskoga formally inaugurated \"Umarell benches\" (sv: umarell-bänkar) for locals to monitor the construction of a local bathhouse.[32][33]",

    "description": "How Dropstone Horizon Mode decouples reasoning depth from context length to enable 24+ hour autonomous engineering workflows.",
    "fullText": "Today we are releasing a technical overview of Horizon Mode, a new distributed runtime architecture designed to solve the \"Linearity Barrier\" in autonomous software engineering.\n\nCurrent Foundation Models (FMs) excel at short-burst generation but suffer from stochastic degradation as reasoning chains extend. In internal benchmarks, we observed that while standard transformers maintain high fidelity for tasks under 1 hour, their probability of maintaining a valid state drops exponentially as workflows exceed 24 hours.\n\nHorizon Mode addresses this by shifting from a monolithic \"next-token\" prediction model to a Recursive Swarm Topology. By orchestrating thousands of ephemeral, specialized agents, we have successfully demonstrated the ability to maintain coherent engineering logic over extended time horizons with a 99% reduction in compute costs compared to homogeneous swarms.\n\nIn traditional \"Monolithic Contextualization,\" an agent’s intelligence is strictly bound by its sliding context window. As a complex engineering task progresses, intermediate reasoning steps fill the window, forcing the model to either compress (lose detail) or truncate (forget instructions). We refer to this phenomenon as Instruction Drift.\n\nFor mission-critical engineering, drift is unacceptable. A security patch written at Hour 20 must strictly adhere to the safety constraints defined at Hour 0.\n\nHorizon Mode moves beyond the single-agent paradigm. Instead of asking one model to \"think harder\" for longer, we virtualize the cognitive process into a distributed search tree.\n\nWe treat compute as a liquid asset. Horizon Mode utilizes a tiered topology to optimize the \"Intelligence-to-Cost\" ratio:\n\nThis ensures that expensive, deep reasoning is only applied to high-value logic paths, not trial-and-error loops.\n\nTo prevent context saturation, we developed the Dynamic Distillation & Deployment (D3) Engine. Unlike standard RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) which relies on semantic similarity, D3 utilizes a Quad-Partite Cognitive Topology.\n\nAs agency increases, so does the risk of Instrumental Convergence (e.g., an agent disabling a firewall to \"fix\" a connection error).\n\nHorizon Mode implements a \"Shared-Nothing\" architecture with a Flash-Gated Consensus Protocol. Agents cannot communicate via natural language. Instead, they emit Boolean signals.\n\nWhen a solution is proposed, the swarm freezes. A dedicated Adversarial Monitor verifies the code against a Hierarchical Verification Stack (CstackC_{stack}). Only solutions that pass Syntactic (L1L_1), Static (L2L_2), and Functional (L3L_3) analysis are committed to the ledger.\n\nWe evaluated Horizon Mode on the internal \"Deep-Sec\" benchmark, which tests an agent's ability to refactor a legacy codebase while maintaining strict security compliance.\n\nHorizon Mode represents a step toward High-Assurance AI. By decoupling reasoning from the limitations of a single context window, we are paving the way for agents that can act as reliable, long-term partners in complex engineering challenges.\n\nWe are currently releasing the Technical Report detailing the architecture and safety protocols.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has turned to his favorite form of leverage in his effort to annex Greenland: Tariffs.\n\nTrump said on Saturday he would impose on February 1 an additional 10% tariff on Denmark, which controls Greenland, as well as Sweden, Norway, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Finland, unless they agree to a deal to hand over Greenland to the United States.\n\nThe president said he would raise those tariffs to 25% in June if they did not comply. All of those countries have already been paying some form of tariff since Trump's Liberation Day levies went into effect in August 2025.\n\n\"This tariff will be due and payable until such time a deal is reached for the complete and total purchase,\" he said in a Truth Social post.\n\nTrump's threat comes as world leaders and CEOs gather in Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum. The president is expected to address the conference in person on Wednesday.\n\nTrump has had Greenland on his mind since his first term, but has ramped up the rhetoric since the US raid in Venezuela that netted Nicolás Maduro.\n\nThe president says US control of Greenland is a national security issue. The Arctic country sits at a strategic point between Russia and China. The US already has a military base, known as the Pituffik Space Base, on the island. Greenland is also a base of critical natural resources, including lithium, gold, iron ore, and oil.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider last week, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Trump administration was considering a range of options to pursue Greenland, including \"utilizing the US Military.\"\n\nTrump's new tariff threat comes as the Supreme Court reviews whether the president has the authority to impose broad, sweeping tariffs on whatever country he wants — and there's a chance it could rule against the president.",

    "fullText": "The AFL-CIO, the country's largest network of labor unions representing some 15 million workers, says ICE is a threat to workers.\n\n\"The Trump administration's militarized immigration enforcement is putting innocent working people in danger,\" the AFL-CIO said in a post on X on Saturday. \"America's unions have your backs.\"\n\nA group of local unions in Minnesota, meanwhile, has endorsed a planned statewide economic blackout in response to ICE actions in the state.\n\nThe Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation, which is affiliated with the AFL-CIO, first announced its endorsement alongside other regional bodies on Friday.\n\n\"The Minnesota labor movement is united against the violent ICE occupation of our beloved cities that has directly impacted union members, our workplaces and our families,\" the group said in a press release.\n\nDozens of community, faith, and union groups are organizing the Day of Truth and Freedom, a call to action asking Minnesotans to avoid work, school, and shopping on January 23 to pause the economy. There will also be a rally and march in downtown Minneapolis at 2 p.m. local time.\n\n\"We will gather with family, neighbors, and community to show Minnesota's moral heart and economic power,\" organizers said in a Facebook post.\n\nOrganizers listed several demands, including that ICE leave Minnesota and that federal funding for ICE be scrapped in the upcoming congressional budget.\n\nThe Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation told Business Insider that ICE's presence is disrupting residents' daily lives.\n\n\"Working people from across sectors — hospitality, healthcare, education, custodial, construction, public works — are being targeted,\" the group said in a statement.\n\nThousands of ICE officers have descended on Minnesota as part of Operation Metro Surge, launched on December 1. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a press release earlier this month that the operation was targeting criminal activity among immigrants in the state.\n\n\"Under President Trump, we will expose and deliver accountability for the rampant fraud and criminality happening in Minnesota. You won't steal from Americans or break our laws and get away with it,\" she said.\n\nThe Trump administration has criticized cities like Minneapolis that have passed so-called \"sanctuary\" laws preventing city resources and police from supporting federal immigration agents. In a statement shared on Friday, the White House said sanctuary cities create \"a climate of hostility that endangers federal officers and incites violence.\" Earlier in the week, the administration said it would cut federal funding to sanctuary cities.\n\nBusiness Insider reached out to ICE, the Department of Homeland Security, and the White House for comment.\n\nMany residents, meanwhile, have criticized the tactics that federal agents are using to locate and detain individuals. Tensions in the state skyrocketed after ICE officer Jonathan Ross fatally shot Renee Good, a 37-year-old American citizen from Minneapolis, on January 7, leading to a wave of protests and outcry.\n\nDays after the shooting, Minnesota's attorney general filed a lawsuit on behalf of Minneapolis, St. Paul, and the state against Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, seeking to end the operation.\n\n\"As a result of this surge, municipalities have been forced to divert local law enforcement resources away from their normal public safety duties, emergency responder resources have been strained, schools have been forced into lockdowns and closures, businesses have been forced to close, and the rights of Minnesotans have been violated time and time again,\" a press release from the Minnesota Attorney General's Office said.\n\nHomeland Security said officers have arrested over 2,500 individuals during Operation Metro Surge so far.\n\nCorrection: January 17, 2026 — Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this story misstated that the AFL-CIO had endorsed the January 23 economic blackout in Minnesota. It has not publicly expressed a position.",

    "description": "We moved from Texas to Denver and downsized our home, gaining more time together, walkability, community, and freedom for our kids.",
    "fullText": "In July 2025, my husband, Zach, and I moved our family of four from the suburbs of Ft Worth, Texas, to Denver.\n\nAfter nearly 10 years of marriage, two kids, and three work-related moves, it was finally time to settle in a place of our choosing. This time, we didn't just want a change of scenery; we wanted a change of lifestyle.\n\nBut finding a house in the bustling city neighborhood of our dreams within our budget meant downsizing — drastically.\n\nMoving from our 3,300-square-foot home to a 2,300-square-foot bungalow with 1,200 square feet of actual living space (the rest being unfinished basement) wasn't easy. It meant swapping our large kitchen island for a small dining table. It meant no more master bath soaking tub, my refuge from life's stresses on more occasions than I could count. And it meant my kids giving up their separate rooms to share one.\n\nBut what we've gained in the quality and quantity of time spent together is worth every bit of lost square footage.\n\nOur bigger house in Texas required more upkeep, and we were more than happy to give that up for extra free time on the weekends. Now, we spend our time visiting attractions such as the Denver Zoo and the Denver Museum of Nature and Science. We're fostering our kids' curiosity, exploring new places together. Our everyday life feels more special and meaningful because these shared experiences amplify our family connection.\n\nWe're also getting out in nature more. Aside from weekend hiking and skiing adventures, our days revolve around outdoor living. We walk everywhere we can, including restaurants, parks, and even Trader Joe's, which is beneficial because driving to Trader Joe's means parking at Trader Joe's, and nobody enjoys that. Our moods are lighter, and our stresses are reduced.\n\nThe first time we walked to a restaurant instead of driving, it felt like we were on vacation. Our lives had always been car-dependent, but that's no longer the case. The kids laughed and raced each other down the sidewalk. We marvelled at the mature trees and brightly colored flowers lining 7th Avenue Parkway. There was no timeline or rushing, just the joy of being present. When we made our way home after an alfresco dinner at Postino, I asked my son if he liked walking to dinner. He asked simply, \"Can we do this every day?\"\n\nZach and I frequently sit on our front porch while our boys play with neighborhood kids, a first for us. Having houses so close together makes it easier to meet people and form real connections. We know almost every household on our block, and we regularly visit with our closest neighbors. We even enjoyed our first block party in August, which fell on my eldest's birthday, and according to him, it was his \"Best birthday ever!\"\n\nOur boys run between yards while we chat with new friends. They are experiencing a childhood closer to the one we grew up with. They're building confidence and finding their place, and that's translating to more smiles and fewer tantrums. Zach and I are finding our village, and parenthood feels less solitary.\n\nOn a recent trip back to Texas for Thanksgiving, I texted our next-door neighbor to let her know we'd be out of town. Without even asking, she offered to take in our mail. It may be a small gesture, but that sense of community is priceless to us.\n\nDownsizing has also allowed our kids to play more independently in an outdoor space that feels safe and protected. We have an unobstructed line of sight to the backyard, and no matter where my husband and I are in the house, we can hear them if they need us. The result has been hours of creative play, building campsites and outdoor kitchens, playing soccer and baseball, and having water balloon fights or Nerf battles.\n\nMost evenings, my kids are in the backyard playing games and getting dirty. When the weather is nice, they run around with their friends down the street. I would never have felt comfortable not knowing every move my kids were making before, but here, where everyone is watching out, and I can wave at my kids down the block to signal when it's time to come home, less space means more freedom.\n\nOur downsized life isn't always perfect. Despite all our decluttering efforts, we're still left with more stuff than we can accommodate. We also struggle with the lack of privacy, and at times, our smaller shared space feels more claustrophobic than cozy. However, downsizing for an urban lifestyle has given us the opportunity to live beyond our four walls, and that's worth more than any amount of space could ever be.",

    "title": "Trump announces he will sue JPMorgan ‘over the next two weeks’ for allegedly ‘DEBANKING’ him",
    "description": "The president also ruled out the bank’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, as a possible pick for Fed chair.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump announced Saturday that he will be suing the investment banking company JPMorgan Chase within “the next two weeks” for allegedly “DEBANKING” him after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection.\n\nTrump has claimed that the investment bank closed or restricted his accounts following the riot, effectively cutting him off from longstanding banking relationships. He has framed the action as politically motivated retaliation, arguing banks acted under pressure from the Biden administration. Trump has increasingly folded this into a broader narrative of “debanking” conservatives.\n\nJPMorgan has denied closing accounts for political reasons.\n\nDuring the 2024 campaign, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon had been floated for Treasury secretary by the president, but their relationship has since soured. Trump in August went after Dimon’s bank, as well as Bank of America, accusing them of discriminating against him in recent years.\n\nEarlier in 2025, the Trump Organization sued Capital One, accusing the bank of improperly cutting off access to the business, which was founded by the president’s late father and was helmed by Trump himself before he entered politics, following the Capitol attack.\n\nThe president also took issue with a Wall Street Journal story, which reported that he offered the Federal Reserve chair position to Dimon. “A front page Article in The Fake News Wall Street Journal states, without any verification, that I offered Jamie Dimon, of JPMorgan Chase, the job of Fed Chairman. This statement is totally untrue, there was never such an offer,” Trump wrote in his Truth Social post.\n\n“Why wouldn’t The Wall Street Journal call me to ask whether or not such an offer was made? I would have very quickly told them, ‘NO,’ and that would have been the end of the story,” Trump added in the post. “Why would I give it to Jamie? No such offer was made there, or even thought of, either. The Wall Street Journal ought to do better ‘fact checking,’ or its already strained credibility will continue to DIVE.”\n\nTrump seemed to be pointing to a story from the Journal published Wednesday, which reported that Trump offered Dimon the role earlier last year. Dimon took that as a joke, according to the Journal, citing people briefed on the discussion.\n\nDimon, asked in an interview with Bloomberg published Thursday whether he’d take the role, said: \"Absolutely, positively no chance, no way, no how, for any reason.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly lashed out at Dimon, dismissing his warnings that the Justice Department’s criminal probe into Fed Chair Jerome Powell, for whom the bank CEO said he has “enormous respect,” could threaten central bank independence. Tensions escalated further as JPMorgan publicly opposed Trump’s proposal to cap credit-card interest rates, with bank executives warning the move would shrink credit and hurt consumers.\n\n\"It would be very bad for consumers, very bad for the economy,\" JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum told reporters on the bank’s earnings call last Tuesday.",

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Hundreds of anti-ICE protesters in Minneapolis chased off a small group of far-right activists who had vowed to march on a neighborhood where many immigrants live on Saturday, stoking tensions in a city on edge after the ​killing of Renee Good by a federal immigration agent 10 days ago.\n\nWaving signs and screaming chants that called for U.S. Immigration and Customs ‌Enforcement and Border Patrol agents to leave Minneapolis, the anti-ICE protesters gathered downtown near City Hall. Scores of them moved forward, forcing about 10 far-right demonstrators against the outside of the municipal ‌government center within minutes. Some in the crowd tossed water balloons that soaked the right-wing demonstrators as temperatures hit -4 degrees Fahrenheit (-20 Celsius) with the wind chill.\n\nPolice maintained their distance as the dueling protests played out. About an hour after the rallies began, the tiny contingent of right-wing activists quickly walked a few blocks away to a hotel, hounded by hundreds of anti-ICE protesters who screamed obscenities and told them to get out of the city. A few scuffles broke out, but Reuters ⁠did not observe any serious violence.\n\nONLINE INFLUENCER REPORTS STABBING ‌ATTEMPT\n\nJake Lang, an online right-wing influencer and one of more than 1,500 people pardoned by President Donald Trump after their criminal convictions related to the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, organized what he called an “anti-fraud” rally. At no point ‍could Lang's voice be heard by the crowd.\n\nLater, Lang posted on X that he was stabbed during a scuffle but that his protective vest blocked the attempt. Reuters could not verify his account.\n\nMinneapolis police said in an email to Reuters they were aware of Lang's social media post, but no official report had been filed with the department. ​Police had received no reports of injuries related to the protests from victims.\n\nCamera feeds showed some people who appeared to be injured, police said, but ‌those individuals left before officers could contact them.\n\nThe anti-ICE protest was organized by the People’s Action Coalition Against Trump.\n\nTrump has repeatedly invoked a scandal around the theft of federal funds intended for social-welfare programs in Minnesota as a rationale for sending thousands of immigration enforcement agents into Minnesota. The president and administration officials have repeatedly singled out the state's community of Somali immigrants.\n\n\"We're here to support our Somali neighbors; they asked for their white allies to show up for them,\" said Laura, 56, who, like all protesters interviewed, asked that their last name not be used for fear of retribution by the federal government. \"I'm here ⁠to exercise my First Amendment right because my neighbors can't, they're too afraid to ​leave their house.\"\n\nLang, who has made anti-Muslim and antisemitic comments, has said he wants to secure ​the U.S. for white Christians. He has been present at small pro-ICE rallies in Minneapolis this week and has targeted Somali immigrants, most of whom are Muslim.\n\nSome 3,000 agents from ICE and Border Patrol have descended on Minneapolis and St. Paul in ‍recent weeks. An ICE agent fatally shot ⁠Good, a U.S. citizen and mother of three, after she drove away after being ordered by ICE agents to exit her vehicle. The officer who shot Good was positioned in front of her car on the left. DHS has said he was hit by the car and ⁠feared for his life, though videos show the agent remaining on his feet and raise questions about how much contact the car made with him.\n\nThe situation has set Minnesota’s Democratic leadership ‌at odds with Trump, whose Justice Department has opened an investigation into Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey.",

Joris Seginds added the extras.\n\nIreland prop Tadhg Furlong came off injured and was replaced by Thomas Clarkson, while soon after Harry Byrne put Leinster's first points on the board with a penalty.\n\nBayonne restored their seven-point advantage when Segonds, the top points scorer in the Top 14, landed a kick from 45 metres after Leo Cullen's side infringed at a line-out.\n\nClarkson then scrambled over the line but the officials adjudged that there had been a double movement as he attempted to ground.\n\nFifteen minutes into the second half Leinster drew level with a converted try from Sheehan.\n\nPrendergast made a break and threw a wide pass to Jimmy O'Brien, who did well to ride a tackle before off-loading inside to the Ireland hooker, who produced a trademark burst of pace to scurry over.\n\nA second penalty of the match for Segonds restored Bayonne's lead and soon after O'Brien went over after getting on the end of Prendergast's grubber kick but replays showed that the full-back had spilled the ball as he went over the line.\n\nSegonds passed up the opportunity to extend the lead as his penalty sailed wide of the posts after Sheehan was penalised for collapsing the maul.\n\nWith six minutes remaining Leinster finally breached their opponents' defences again when Byrne chipped ahead and the ball bounced favourably for Prendergast, who dotted down between the posts.\n\nDeegan dived over in the corner in the final minute to increase the winning margin.\n\nBayonne: C Tiberghien; T Spring, S Maqala, M Tuilagi, Y Orabe; J Segonds, H Jantjies; I Calles, L Martin, J Tagi; E Johnson, L Paulos; A Fischer, A Iturria (capt), N Lomidze.\n\nReplacements: F Bosch, E Tumania, E Setiano, A Garcia Iandolino, B Heguy, M Ariceta, G Martocq, V Hannoun.\n\nLeinster: J O'Brien; T O'Brien; G Ringrose, R Henshaw; J Kenny; H Byrne, J Gibson-Park; J Boyle, R Kelleher, T Furlong; RG Snyman, J Ryan; M Deegan, J van der Flier, C Doris (capt).\n\nReplacements: D Sheehan, J Cahir, T Clarkson, J McCarthy, S Penny, L McGrath, S Prendergast, R Ioane.",

    "fullText": "Former Peterborough United and Hull City striker and Final Score pundit Aaron McLean gives his five takeaways from across the Championship, League One and League Two this weekend.\n\nChampionship leaders Coventry came back from 1-0 down to beat Leicester and end their three-game winless run, while fourth-placed Millwall defeated in-form Watford to stay in contention at the top.\n\nMcLean: \"The beginning of the season was incredible for Coventry but they have, by their own admission, hit a bit of a tough patch - so to get their first win in four league games will have done them the world of good.\n\n\"Frank Lampard will be feeling a lot brighter this evening. To come from behind and show the character they showed, and for Ellis Simms and Haji Wright to get back in the goals, I think everything is pointing back in the right direction.\n\n\"The most important thing after Middlesbrough won last night was to make sure they did their job and they did.\n\n\"Tuesday's game with in-form Millwall looks like it could be a great one for the neutral.\n\n\"I think what they have done so far has been absolutely incredible. I hope they can maintain it. They're not a team who will blow teams away but what they will do is grind points out.\n\n\"To go away to Watford, who on their day can beat anyone in this division and had been in fabulous form, and come away with the points and a clean sheet will show what they are about.\n\n\"They will be thinking this could be their season.\"\n\nSouthampton's poor form continued as they fell to a 2-1 home defeat by Hull City to stretch their run without a victory to seven matches.\n\nMcLean: \"The momentum for Southampton has dwindled away.\n\n\"They had that new manager bounce but over the past few weeks they have almost reverted to type and when they concede a goal it's that 'here we go again' syndrome and they can't seem to shake it..\n\n\"They desperately need a good win to get the feeling back.\n\n\"It feels like they will struggle to get anywhere near the play-offs.\n\n\"First of all they need to get some clean sheets. They're not keeping clean sheets and that is not giving them an opportunity to go and take something.\n\n\"If they can just go and grind out a couple of 1-0 wins then that will give them the confidence that they can go and be a bit more expansive.\n\n\"That is what the squad has been built in that mould but now they need to tighten up.\n\n\"At the moment it isn't working and they're getting punished.\"\n\nNew West Brom boss Eric Ramsay saw his side battle back from two goals down only to lose 3-2 at home to second-placed Middlesbrough on Friday. Norwich's 2-1 win at Wrexham on Saturday leaves them four points behind the Baggies before Tuesday's game between the two sides.\n\nMcLean: \"Going back to Friday night's game between West Brom and Middlesbrough, I feel like new boss Eric Ramsay has a huge job on his hands.\n\n\"They lost to an unbelievable strike in their last league game at Leicester and then they did so well to come back to 2-2 to Middlesbrough and then to lose so late on, I feel sorry for them.\n\n\"That has been their Achilles' heel though, they have conceded late goals time and time again.\n\n\"At this stage of the year you find yourselves in that position because your performances aren't good enough. Away from home their results have been abysmal and they find themselves in a lot of trouble.\n\n\"I look at Norwich, who they play on Tuesday in what looks like another great match, they have got that new manager bounce under Philippe Clement, and the Baggies need that now.\n\n\"It looks bleak but there is time to turn it around.\"\n\nLeague One leaders Cardiff City won 2-1 at third-placed Bradford City to strengthen their position at the top, while at the bottom, Doncaster claimed just a second league win since September with a 1-0 success at fellow strugglers AFC Wimbledon.\n\nMcLean: \"I look at Cardiff as the strongest team in that league and they will just be looking to keep Lincoln at arm's length.\n\n\"The Imps are the most in-form team in the division but let a two-goal lead slip to draw 2-2 at Luton today.\n\n\"I think if Cardiff finish above Lincoln then they will have won the league.\n\n\"I also like what Mansfield, who beat bottom side Port Vale 3-0 today, are doing. They've got momentum, they've got confidence and in Nigel Clough they've got a brilliant manager.\n\n\"They're winning games and getting a good level of consistency, if they can keep doing that then will put themselves in the play-off race.\n\n\"Down at the bottom of the league, it was a huge win for Doncaster against another team who have dropped off in AFC Wimbledon.\n\n\"The Dons shot themselves in the foot with a late red card and then conceding in the ninth minute of time added on. That is a hammer blow for Johnnie Jackson.\n\n\"For Doncaster it was a desperately needed win. When you go into a new year you are looking for that spark and that result today could give them that.\n\n\"It is the best way to win. There is no better feeling than a late win away from home. They need to bottle that and take it into the remaining games.\"\n\nIn League Two, Shrewsbury claimed a vital win against 10-man Harrogate to move four points clear of the bottom two.\n\nMcLean: \"Down at the bottom of League Two it was massive result for Shrewsbury.\n\n\"When you are down the wrong end of a division you have got to beat the teams around you.\n\n\"For Harrogate it's now 16 games without a win. Simon Weaver will be feeling the pressure and this will have been a game they'd have been looking at and thinking a result there today could have given them a major boost.\n\n\"The only team below them in the league Newport also took a really tough loss that I think just sums up their season.\n\n\"To concede in the 91st minute and the 99th minute, having taken the lead at Gillingham in the 84th minute... That shows boss Christian Fuchs the size of the job he has got.\n\n\"I think they're going to struggle to stay up but they're still within a shout because the teams above them aren't winning games either.\"\n\nAaron McLean was talking to BBC Sport England's Ian Woodcock.",

    "fullText": "Manchester City were outfought by rivals Manchester United on Saturday lunchtime in a derby defeat that not only gave their neighbours a winning start to a new era, but also dealt a further blow to the Citizens' title hopes.\n\nCity's demoralising 2-0 loss at a raucous Old Trafford allowed the home faithful to deservedly claim the bragging rights over their closest geographical rivals as they revelled in the perfect start to Michael Carrick's tenure as interim head coach.\n\nBut for the blue half of the city, defeat leaves them clinging to the title race by their fingertips, potentially falling nine points behind leaders Arsenal by the end of the day.\n\nThis was City's sixth game in 17 days and boss Pep Guardiola felt a lack of energy contributed to the defeat, rather than referee Anthony Taylor's decision to not send off United's Diogo Dalot in the first half.\n\n\"The better team won,\" said the Spaniard. \"They had something we didn't have. We always talk about the energy we need. It's related to how you defend, some moments, some duels and some situations, but also with the ball.\n\n\"It's my 27th derby. I came here many times and [today] we were not at the required level to win this type of game.\n\n\"We try. We talk about that but we had that energy four days ago at Newcastle.

    "fullText": "NBA commissioner Adam Silver says he wants to \"tap into\" Europe's football culture as part of the plans for a proposed European basketball league.\n\nSilver says he has spoken to Manchester City and Manchester United, though BBC Sport understands neither intends to have a team should the venture come to fruition.\n\nWith a current working title of NBA Europe, the plan is to launch a permanent league across the continent that could start as soon as the 2027-28 season.\n\nAs many as 16 teams across the continent could be involved, with a team from both London and Manchester expected to feature.\n\nThe league is expected to be made up of new franchises, current basketball teams and football clubs who do and do not currently have associated basketball teams.\n\n\"We're having conversations with everyone, and it's part of why this process has gone on so long,\" Silver told BBC Sport.\n\n\"I began speaking publicly around the Paris Olympics, and we wanted to make sure we've covered everybody. We've talked to all interested parties, we're covering all areas and all opportunities.\"\n\nSilver also confirmed that he has spoken to Real Madrid, Barcelona and Paris St-Germain as he looks to mix established European teams with new ones.\n\nHowever, reports say the existing EuroLeague - which features Real and Barcelona - has concerns about the new venture, threatening legal action against the NBA should clubs break existing agreements to take part in the new competition.\n\nBut Silver, speaking before the NBA's first regular season match in London since 2019 on Sunday, feels the already existing strong support of football clubs could play a major role in growing the game across Europe.\n\n\"I want to be careful [of] those traditions,\" he said.\n\n\"That culture is so special, so unique, so long held, I don't want to fool myself or anybody else potentially involved in this new league that they can be easily transferred.\n\n\"At the same time, we want the benefits of that incredible wisdom and knowledge obtained over decades of operation.\n\n\"As an American, I see that religious fervour around people's football clubs here, and we could only be so lucky to tap into that. It's more singularly focused here. To me, that represents opportunity.\n\n\"We don't come into the market thinking we're going to take from football. What we see is a large opportunity and entertainment ecosystem, and we're seeing that all over the world that people are turning to premium live sports.\"",

    "fullText": "Thomas Frank's future may lie in the hands of those in power at Tottenham Hotspur, but the court of public opinion has delivered its damning final verdict.\n\nThe Dane has been the target for toxicity before as he fails dismally to win over Spurs supporters unconvinced by his pedigree after arriving from Brentford, along with a stodgy style regarded as conservative and dull.\n\nNot like this, though. Not on the levels of fury aimed at Frank at the dramatic conclusion of the 2-1 home defeat by struggling West Ham United.\n\nFrank looked a hapless, beaten figure as he offered polite applause to those who turned on him savagely after Callum Wilson bundled home a stoppage-time winner - the cue for a storm of discontent to be unleashed in his direction.\n\nSpurs fans were chanting \"sacked in the morning\" at their own manager even during the video assistant referee check for offside that eventually cleared Wilson's winner.\n\nSeconds later, when the final whistle confirmed the latest blow inflicted on Frank, it felt like there was no way back. This was the sound of a fanbase who had given up on their head coach, who no longer wanted him at the club.\n\nBrutal - but this was the inescapable conclusion. Frank was stunned, appearing broken as the pressure increasingly grows on his position.\n\nFormer Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney, told BBC Match of the Day: \"I felt for him - I have been in that position. It is a lonely position to be in. The Tottenham fans have spoken and, when that happens, it looks like he will lose his job.\"\n\nEx-England striker Alan Shearer, added: \"The players are not giving enough, there is no doubt but I don't see a plan or a system and some players are looking lost.\n\n\"When you look at some of their signings in the summer, I am thinking you have to give something extra. He knows the rules though, if you don't win games you are going to get sacked. He looked a very tired man by the end.\"",

    "fullText": "John Higgins stunned world number one Judd Trump as he fought back from 3-0 and 5-3 down to win 6-5 and reach his first Masters final since 2021.\n\nThe Scot will now face Kyren Wilson in Sunday's best-of-19 showpiece match beginning at 13:00 GMT, after he defeated Chinese debutant Wu Yize 6-5 in another thrilling last-four encounter.\n\nHiggins had lost his previous seven matches against Trump and appeared to be toiling as he made a series of errors in the opening three frames.\n\nHowever, Trump, whose highest break until that point was just 60, failed to convert two good opportunities to take the fourth frame which provided Higgins with a route back into the contest.\n\n\"He should maybe have been 4-0 in front and I maybe made it too easy for him,\" Higgins, who won the second of his two Masters titles 20 years ago, told BBC Sport.\n\n\"The fourth frame was massive because if he goes 4-0 it's done, but at 3-1 I felt good.\"\n\n\"People will laugh but I think I'm a better player now than I've ever been. You play these great champions like Judd and I am so proud because I've lost the last few against him.\"\n\nWith the momentum shifting, Higgins, 50, also took the fifth with a superb 104 break.\n\nThe Englishman pinched the sixth and eighth frames with half centuries after his opponent missed reds, but Higgins made a 57 clearance in similar fashion to take frame seven.\n\nTrump, 36, who has generally held sway in meetings between the pair since triumphing in their 2019 world final, looked set to seal victory in the ninth frame but with just four balls to pot, remarkably missed a routine brown.\n\nAnd that gave Higgins the impetus to craft pressure-breaks of 70 and 57 on his way to reeling off three tense frames in a row to complete a remarkable turnaround and become the oldest player to reach the final of a Triple Crown event.",

    "description": "Arne Slot responds after Liverpool are booed by sections of their home support in the 1-1 draw with Burnley at Anfield on Saturday.",
    "fullText": "Not for the first time this season, the full-time whistle at Anfield was met with boos from sections of the home support.\n\nFor the first time since the 1980-81 top-flight season, Liverpool had failed to win any of their three home league games against newly promoted sides.\n\nArne Slot's side drew 1-1 against Sunderland last month before drawing 0-0 against Leeds on New Year's Day. Saturday's 1-1 draw against Burnley completed the set.\n\nAsked about the boos, Slot said: \"In my head it wasn't booing but in my head it was frustration as well. If you, as Liverpool, are not disappointed by having a draw at home to Burnley then something is completely wrong.\n\n\"I completely understand the frustration. I have the same frustrations and the players definitely have the same frustrations as the fans.\"\n\nIn fairness, Slot's side did more than enough to win here against a Burnley side that scored from their only attempt on target.\n\nThe statistics alone told the story. Liverpool had 76 touches in the opposition box, 32 shots, 11 attempts on target and an xG of 2.95.\n\nOnly three times since records began have Liverpool taken more shots in a Premier League game without winning.\n\n\"I agree that we should have won this game,\" Slot told Match of the Day. \"There wasn't a lot more I could ask in terms of chance creation. We have a lot of ball possession but I would love us to create more.\n\n\"If we play a bit more open you always wonder if the other team can counter-attack you more, which you couldn't. I don't know how many moments we had but we could only score one.\"",
