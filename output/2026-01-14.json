The decision to make changes to the rotation may help the team find something that works better or even light a fire under some players to improve their play.\n\n“I’m not into worry about guys feelings right now. As coaches our feelings are hurt as well. You know I think we have enough team guys on our team to understand that what we’re doing right now, the lineups we have are not working. You know hopefully someone responds to you know sitting on the bench, but not playing as much. That’s what competitors do and we just hope that they respond to it and prove us wrong because they’re going to play harder or be more disciplined in terms of what we’re trying to get done as a team.”\n\nUSI will face Tennessee Tech on the road Thursday, January 15th, at 7:30 p.m. The game is set to stream on ESPN Plus.",

    "fullText": "There are moments in tennis when the crowd senses the tide turning long before the players do. And then there are moments – like the one that unfolded on a hot Wednesday afternoon in Melbourne, when even the player in control has absolutely no idea what’s coming next. Austria’s Sebastian Ofner thought he had sealed the second qualifier at the 2026 AO against Nishesh Basavareddy. But the 20-year-old American had other plans…\n\nUp 7-1 in the deciding super tie-break, the Austrian raised his arms, pumped his fist, and tapped the side of his head as if reminding the world of his mental edge. He strutted forward, basking in what he believed was a done deal. But the Australian Open‘s qualifying format has one brutal quirk: the third-set tie-break goes to 10, not 7. Ofner didn’t know it. And that moment of premature celebration was all Nishesh Basavareddy needed to swing open a door that had something firmly shut. Just over 10 minutes later, Ofner had lost 13-11 to the American and eventually got eliminated from qualification.\n\nThe match ended at 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (13-11) in favor of Nishesh Basavareddy. Now, coming to his celebration… well, instead of a muted reaction, Basavareddy turned toward the crowd, placed both hands around his throat, and delivered a deliberate “choke” gesture – pointed reference to Ofner’s early celebration and the unraveling that followed.\n\nIt was icy, unapologetic, and brutally symbolic! Even so, Sebastian Ofner met Basavareddy at the net for a handshake before trudging off the court. The mood was surreal: equal parts disbelief and secondhand embarrassment. Moments later, reactions started to pour in on social media.\n\nAmerican tennis journalist Ben Rothenberg tweeted, “Holy crap, he lost. After Ofner’s premature celebration, Basavareddy won eight of the next nine points, then hung on to take the tiebreak 13-11. Wildest ride of the Australian Open so far; should make for some viral videos…” Barstool Tennis didn’t hold back either, calling the whole episode “insanity.”\n\nPainfully for Ofner, this wasn’t new territory. In 2023 at Kitzbuhel, he led Alex Molcan 6-4, 5-0… only to lose seven straight games, drop the second set, and eventually lose the match in a tiebreak. Wednesday’s meltdown felt like deja vu, another match that slipped through his fingers just when it seemed secure.\n\nFor Nishesh Basavareddy, though, this was another showcase of the grit he’s been building on the big stage. Now, he moves on to face Britain’s George Loffhager in a bid to enter the main draw. Remember what happened last year?\n\nThere aren’t many young players who get a nod of approval from Novak Djokovic before stepping on court with him. And there are even fewer who manage to rattle the 10x AO champion once the match begins. But in 2025, Nishesh Basavareddy did both. Last year, he arrived in Melbourne as a wildcard, a teenager still trying to find his place in the crowded world of rising tennis talents. And guess what? He got the chance to face the 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic in his very first match.\n\nBut before the match, Djokovic was seen rating this youngster pretty highly. “I saw that he’s very quick. He’s a very talented player. He’s got great hands. He’s very dynamic. He can serve well, hit spots. Just a very complete game overall. Yeah, I mean, it’s going to be his, I guess, first time in the main draw of the Grand Slam, wild card, playing on the center court. Not much to lose. I’m sure that he is going to be really pumped to make a statement.”\n\nJust like what he said, Nishesh Basavareddy’s fearless start in this epic battle earned him the first set against the Serbian superstar. When the American took the opening set 6-4, the arena erupted. But then, Djokovic eventually steadied the ship and won the next three sets to wrap up the match at 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-2.\n\nAfter the match, Novak Djokovic even shared a heartfelt message for the youngster. “Well played, Nishesh Basavareddy, impressive slam debut.” Even tennis legend Mats Wilander spoke highly of the American.\n\nDuring his conversation on Eurosport, Wilander said, “First impression was brilliant. The technique was similar to Novak’s. The forehand was very similar. A better forehand than Novak had when Novak was at his age, because Novak struggled with his forehand early on. He moves well enough. He needs to get a little bit stronger. His serve, technically, I thought was good enough. So he has a bright future and another American youngster.”\n\nIf Novak Djokovic’s early praise was a prediction, Nishesh Basavreddy is already proving him right. How far do you think this young American can reach at the 2026 AO?\n\nThe post Nishesh Basavareddy Turns Heads With ‘Choke’ Celebration After Rival’s Error at Australian Open appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

But a steal and slam by Yessoufou halted the surge and deflated any hope of a comeback for the crowd at Gallagher-Iba Arena.\n\nFrom there, Baylor matched every Cowboys push with timely buckets. Agbim, who played all 40 minutes, hit a key 3-pointer to maintain momentum as the Bears coasted through the final stretch.\n\nYessoufou sealed the victory in the closing minutes, surpassing 20 points before Baylor closed out its first conference win of 2026.

    "fullText": "Mike Tomlin rumored to be a \"top\" candidate for AFC head coaching job originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nMike Tomlin shocked the NFL world by stepping down from his role as the head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nTomlin had been the head man in Pittsburgh since 2007, won a Super Bowl, and never had a losing record with the team. However, the team failed to advance in the postseason again this season, and it seems like it's time for a change.\n\nThere has been some speculation that Tomlin could take a year off, similar to what Mike Vrabel did after splitting with the Titans. However, what if the perfect job is available that Tomlin can't say no to?\n\nNFL insider Josina Anderson is reporting that Tomlin is a \"top\" candidate for the Miami Dolphins job. The Dolphins fired Mike McDaniel and could be looking for a more experienced option with their next hire.\n\n“‘John Harbaugh & Mike Tomlin are at the top of the (Miami Dolphins) wish list (at head coach),’ a league source said again just now. We’ll see…if the Dolphins can pull either off,” said Anderson. “It takes two to tango.\"\n\nAnderson was also reportedly told by a source that Tomlin \"would prefer to coach in a warm-weather environment, if it fits.\"\n\nAs Anderson mentioned, the Dolphins could be going hard after both Tomlin and John Harbaugh. Both coaches are experienced winners from the AFC North who are somewhat surprisingly available.\n\nThe Dolphins certainly need a fresh start. The team has not won a playoff game since the year 2000. The Dolphins made the playoffs in 2022 and 2023, but failed to get back to the postseason in 2024 or 2025.\n\nTomlin would immediately bring credibility to the Dolphins and would likely make some veterans want to play there.\n\nOf course, there's no guarantee Tomlin would want to start over in Miami. Sure, the weather is nice, but the Dolphins are in a terrible cap situation and are seemingly stuck with Tua Tagovailoa at quarterback.\n\nWould Tomlin prefer to just sit this season out and see what options are available next season? Regardless, it seems like the Dolphins are exploring all options and could be a major player in the market.\n\nMike McDaniel could be headed to the AFC North\n\nRobert Griffin III roasts Browns after disastrous season\n\nDid the Dolphins fire McDaniel because of Harbaugh?\n\nFalcons listed as top landing spot for elite head coach\n\nAre the Cardinals the worst HC job in the NFL?\n\nPete Carroll could be replaced by elite college coach",

    "fullText": "LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) — Kansas finally showed what it could do with a healthy Darryn Peterson and a regular rotation Tuesday night.\n\nThe timing couldn't have been worse for second-ranked Iowa State.\n\nAfter falling from the AP Top 25 following a second loss in their first three Big 12 games, the Jayhawks roared away from the stunned Cyclones the moment the ball was thrown up. Tre White hit four early 3-pointers and went on to score 19 points, Peterson contributed 16 before more cramping issues, and Kansas coasted to an 84-63 victory over previously unbeaten Iowa State.\n\n“This is more what I envisioned,” Jayhawks coach Bill Self said. “We've got an elite player — we got an elite scorer — and even tonight, when (Peterson) went to get his own, he can do some things other guys can't do. But the thing is the other guys are good players. We don't need to defer to him. I don't know that we've found that balance yet. But tonight was the closest thing to it.”\n\nMelvin Council Jr. added 15 points and Flory Bidunga had 10 for the Jayhawks (12-5, 2-2 Big 12), who led by 26 in the first half, had that advantage trimmed to 11 midway through the second, then answered with a 10-0 run to put the game away.\n\nIt was the kind of performance that college basketball fans have become accustomed to seeing from the Jayhawks over the years.\n\nMuch more familiar than recent losses to unranked UCF and West Virginia.\n\n“They were extremely well-prepared, well-coached, like we knew they would be,” Iowa State coach T.J. Otzelberger said. “Extremely urgent (for Kansas) to come out and play with a tremendous spirit, which they did, so credit to them.\n\n“That was an absolute beat-down,” Otzelberger added, “in their favor, unfortunately.”\n\nThere are a multitude of reasons for a stumbling start to the season, which had the Jayhawks in danger of their first 1-3 start to league play since the 1987-88 season. But the biggest may have been the cramping problems that had kept Peterson off the court for long stretches and kept the Jayhawks from getting into a rhythm even when he was available.\n\nHe was still massaging his calf on the bench Tuesday night, and at one point, Peterson grabbed it after going high for a dunk. But Self said the issue wasn't as serious as earlier in the year: “It was more of, ‘I’m not quite whole right now.'”\n\n“Feeling better. It's coming back slowly to me,” Peterson said. “I was out for a while but every game is getting better. This was a great win, especially coming off the loss to West Virginia. We knew we had to come out and get a win.”\n\nThe Jayhawks clearly felt a sense of urgency. They even had a players-only meeting — Self insisted he knew nothing about it — during which they talked about their goals for the season and what it would take to get back on track.\n\n“Just kind of reiterating the key things that we want to identify ourselves as this year,” White said, “and just internal conversations that made us more focused on what we want to do. It definitely made us more connected.”\n\nIt was evident from the opening minutes, when Kansas opened with an 11-3 run to get the crowd into the game.\n\nKansas pushed the lead to 26 points before Iowa State mounted its only real comeback, stringing together some stops and getting some buckets to go on each side of halftime. But eventually, the Jayhawks found their stride again, and they quickly pushed the lead back over 20 points before emptying the bench in the final minutes.\n\nWhat made the performance particularly impressive was the opposition: Iowa State was off to a 16-0 start, including a 23-point road win over then-No. 1 Purdue, and the Cyclones were one of two teams receiving No. 1 votes in the AP Top 25 this week.\n\n“We looked a little spooked and panicked, and the moment got to us,” Otzelberger said. “We know how well prepared they were going to be. We know how competitive they're going to be. We know how much confidence they have, especially in this building. You can tell they've been on the practice court working, and getting ready, and they did a tremendous job.”\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 all season.

    "fullText": "The Red Storm defied odds last season, winning the Big East regular-season championship and their first Big East Tournament title since 2000. But this year has been a different story. Rick Pitino’s side are 12–5 to start the season, they’ve fallen out of the rankings, and that comes with consequences.\n\nSt. John’s parted ways with general manager Matt Abdelmassih. He was long considered one of the most important figures behind St. John’s roster construction and transfer portal strategy. Abdelmassih had been on administrative leave since mid-December. According to journalist Roger Rubin of Newsday Sports, financial deals made by the General Manager had been under investigation in recent weeks, prompting his exit from the program.\n\nWhen Rick Pitino was asked about the situation, he had a rather cold response. “It’s out of my hands. I found out tonight. All I was told four days ago is look for another general manager. They said to me, ‘ don’t ask any questions.’ I said, ‘Okay, I’ll look for one.’ So, it’s really not a big deal,” Pitino said after the win against Marquette.\n\nHe continued, “What’s a big deal is making sure that we don’t lose anything. But that’s a university decision. I’ll abide by. They didn’t ask me my opinion, and I didn’t give it because they didn’t, and in their defense, they didn’t want to bother me. They didn’t want to distract me right now, and I appreciate that.”\n\nThe post Rick Pitino Offers Cold Reality Check After St. John’s Parts Ways With GM Abdelmassih appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "description": "Is Golden Boy Promotions headed for the same fate as Top Rank? From the looks of things, the possibility can’t be ruled out entirely. Vergil Ortiz Jr.",
    "fullText": "Is Golden Boy Promotions headed for the same fate as Top Rank? From the looks of things, the possibility can’t be ruled out entirely. Vergil Ortiz Jr., promoted by Golden Boy, and Jaron Ennis, who fights under Matchroom Boxing, have been in negotiations for a potential showdown since late 2025. However, the two sides have yet to finalize an agreement. And the cause appears to be Oscar De La Hoya.\n\nBoth fighters are reportedly eager to make the bout happen, and initial talks saw their respective promotions agree to a 50–50 purse split, with an additional 5% going to the winner. But negotiations hit another roadblock when Golden Boy head Oscar De La Hoya later demanded a revised 60–40 split in Ortiz’s favor. That move stalled the fight once again and has now drawn DAZN into the ongoing negotiations.\n\nAccording to veteran boxing journalist Dan Rafael, Golden Boy Promotions’ TV deal with DAZN has expired. And they are pressuring the promotion to make the Ortiz vs. Ennis fight to extend the contract. “I understand it this way: Golden Boy’s contract with DAZN is expiring and has not officially been renewed. To reach a new agreement, DAZN was putting pressure on De La Hoya with the demand to make the Ennis–Ortiz fight,” Rafael said on the Big Fight Weekend podcast.\n\nOscar De La Hoya, through his Golden Boy Promotions, first partnered with DAZN in October 2018. Since then, the retired world champion has come under scrutiny time and time again for his feuds with his own fighters. His infamous clash with former Golden Boy star Canelo Alvarez saw the two enter court, and Alvarez later even left the promotion. De La Hoya has also found himself at odds with Ryan Garcia on several occasions.\n\nIt’s yet to be seen whether De La Hoya caves to DAZN’s demands to let the fight between Ortiz and Ennis proceed with a 50-50 purse split. De La Hoya previously claimed that the promotion is looking elsewhere for an opponent for Ortiz Jr. In the meantime, however, Vergil Ortiz Jr.’s manager is growing impatient with De La Hoya’s demand, which is causing the delay in making the fight against Jaron Ennis a reality.\n\nVergil Ortiz Jr.’s manager, Rick Mirigian, pushed back against GB Promotions chairman Oscar De La Hoya after he claimed the company was “moving on” from a potential fight with Jaron Ennis. Speaking to BoxingScene, Mirigian made it clear the decision was not Golden Boy’s to make.\n\n“I have the right to negotiate with anyone,” Mirigian said. “They don’t have the authorization to say [the deal must be] 60% to 40%—60-40 of what? You can’t ‘move on’ when no one has spoken to us.” Mirigian stressed that Ortiz wants the fight and accused Golden Boy of presenting only one opponent and an inadequate financial offer.\n\n“We were given one number, and we gave a counter that was denied,” he explained. Rejecting claims that negotiations are over, Mirigian added, “We are not ‘moving on.’ We will negotiate. Vergil wants to make this fight, and so do I.”\n\nIt appears Golden Boy Promotions has found itself in a difficult spot. Although they want the most money for their fighter, which will, of course, benefit them as well, Ortiz Jr. seems adamant about facing Ennis. Plus, DAZN is breathing down their neck to make the fight happen. Do you think it will?\n\nThe post Boots vs. Ortiz Drama Puts Oscar De La Hoya’s DAZN Future at Risk appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "fullText": "Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship and Bare Knuckle Fight League are making their official entry into India, marking a significant expansion into one of the world’s largest combat sports markets.\n\nThe move is being spearheaded by World League of Fighters, BKFC’s license holder, which is co-founded by Rajesh Banga, Sunil Mathew and Siraj Gill. The organization has brought in prominent film producer Parag Sanghvi and Bollywood star and martial artist Tiger Shroff to join the board alongside BKFC founder and president David Feldman and former two-division UFC champion Conor McGregor, who became a part-owner of BFKC in 2024.\n\nMiss Universe Harnaaz Sandhu Joins Tiger Shroff, Sanjay Dutt in 'Baaghi 4' - Global Bulletin\n\nNetflix, Amazon Prime, ZEE5, SonyLIV Vie for India's IFFI Streaming Honor - Global Bulletin\n\nFox Orders Lifeguard Drama Series 'Rescue: Hi-Surf' from Producer John Wells (TV News Roundup)\n\nWLF previously delivered a sold-out BKFC event in Dubai last year, which the organization describes as the biggest bare-knuckle fighting event held in the Middle East.\n\nThe India expansion will introduce a team-based bare-knuckle league format – marking the first time such a structure has been implemented in the history of the sport. The format will feature six inaugural teams: Crushers, Punishers, Warriors, Phantoms, Gladiators and Infernos, transforming individual fights into a franchise-based competition.\n\nRahul Saxena has been appointed CEO to lead the platform. He brings experience in scaling global brands to the role.\n\n“India is not just a market – it is the future of global combat sports,” Banga, Mathew and Gill said in a joint statement. “Together with BKFC, BKFL and WLF, we are building an ecosystem that will develop Indian fighters, create global stars and deliver world-class fight entertainment to millions of fans.”\n\nSanghvi positioned the venture as an opportunity to build a sports intellectual property from India with global reach. “This is where world-class storytelling meets raw, uncompromising sport,” he said. “With WLF, BKFC and Conor McGregor, we are not just launching a league – we are architecting a global sports IP from India that will command attention, talent and fandom worldwide.”\n\nFeldman emphasized India’s longstanding position in the organization’s expansion strategy. “India has been on our roadmap for a long time,” he said. “The scale, the energy, the culture — there is no place like it. With the leadership team we have assembled and our partnership with WLF, we are bringing the purest form of combat sports to a nation ready for it.”\n\nMcGregor, who serves as a global partner for BKFC, framed the expansion as transformative. “India has warriors in its DNA,” he said. “What we’re building with BKFC and BKFL in India will be something the world has never seen before. This is not just expansion – this is a revolution.”\n\nShroff, joining McGregor as a board member, highlighted the cultural significance of the venture. “Honored to stand alongside Conor McGregor as we create something truly historic for Indian sport,” he said. “This is more than a fight – it’s a global movement, and history is being written. Just like cinema, sport is a celebration of talent and skill, and Parag [Sanghvi] and I are committed to turning this into a landmark moment for India.”\n\nThe first official BKFC and BKFL team-based events are scheduled for 2026, with venue and fight card details to be announced.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\nOscar Predictions: Original Screenplay — With Few Signals, 'Sinners' Takes an Early Lead\n\nOscar Predictions: ‘Sinners’ Could Shatter the All-Time Nomination Record as International Films Hope for Recognition\n\nNew Movies Out Now in Theaters: What to See This Week",

    "fullText": "Following Ruben Amorim’s sacking, quite a few plans have changed at Manchester United.\n\nA new caretaker in Michael Carrick has stepped in, new coaches have come in to assist him, and plenty of first-team stars will hope their fortunes will also change as a result.\n\nQuite a few players would have liked to have played more under the Portuguese, but their chances remained few and far between.\n\nKobbie Mainoo is one of them, so is Joshua Zirkzee. The Dutchman started a mere four games under the ex-Sporting CP boss.\n\nWith the World Cup coming up, he was desperate to play more in a bid to make the Netherlands team for the quadrennial showpiece.\n\nDespite interest from England, all signs pointed towards a return to Italy where AS Roma were pushing the hardest.\n\nIn fact, at one stage, the Giallorossi had even agreed on the outlines of a deal and agreed personal terms with the forward.\n\nHowever, INEOS blocked the deal, waiting for the caretaker to take the final call. And the final decision was that the 24-year-old would not be allowed to join the Serie A side.\n\nAnd as per SportsBoom, that has left the former Bologna ace devastated as he wanted a fresh start and had even told his inner circle he expected to be playing in the Serie A from January onwards.\n\n“Manchester United striker Joshua Zirkzee has been left disgruntled after his move to Roma collapsed, SportsBoom can exclusively reveal.\n\n“Sources close to the player have said the Dutch international expected to be a Roma player by the end of the window.\n\n“The move has been mooted for months with Zirkzee struggling to make his mark at the Red Devils since his £36.5million move to Old Trafford last season. And Zirkzee is said to be disappointed his future has been left in limbo.”\n\nJoshua Zirkzee has two goals and one assist this season and did not start a single game under interim boss Darren Fletcher.\n\nWith Benjamin Sesko back amongst the goals, and with Bryan Mbeumo and Amad also back, it will be interesting to see how many minutes he gets under Michael Carrick.\n\nFeature image Molly Darlington via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

The hosts (15-3, 7-0) led by as many as 12 points in the third quarter then had to hang on as the Panthers (17-1, 7-1) rallied to close within two in the final seconds.\n\nLast year, Morton went to No. 1 Washington and ended the Panthers season-opening 21-game win streak with a 46-45 win at Torry Gym. The Panthers returned the favor by beating the Potters in the regular season finale and in the sectional championship on the way to finishing third at state.\n\nPenelope Drake scored nine points for the Potters but may have delivered the game’s biggest play when she blocked a three-point shot by Washington’s Avery Tibbs with 0:15 left as Washington was aiming to tie the game. Tibbs finished with a game-high 14 points.\n\nThe two teams will meet again on Feb. 10 in the final game of the regular season in Washington.\n\nOther girls basketball winners included Notre Dame, Richwoods, Normal Community, Normal West, Metamora, Canton. Pekin, and Illini Bluffs. Boys basketball winners Tuesday included Normal Community, Normal West, Richwoods, Manual, Washington, Leroy, Fieldcrest, El Paso-Gridley, Elmwood and Peoria Heights.",

    "fullText": "Editor's note: Coaches are reminded to send in game results each weeknight, from 6-10 p.m., by emailing them to pjsports@providencejournal.com\n\nMarielle Nassiff provided some offensive pop in the third quarter that gave the Quakers the separation they needed to close out the Purple in their 51-37 win.\n\nThe first quarter was tough defensive basketball, as Moses Brown led 9-4, then took a 24-15 lead into halftime thanks to nine points from Nassiff and six from Lauren Bousquet in the second quarter.\n\nWith Classical still hanging around, the Quakers revved up the defensive measures. They limited the Purple to just five points in the third quarter and Nassiff got herself some buckets, scoring eight points in the stretch to build a 42-20 lead heading to the fourth quarter.\n\nNassiff finished as Moses Brown’s top scorer with 23 points. Bousquet was right behind her with 21 points and Adelaide Crosby and Madison Wilson accounted for the remaining seven points.\n\nJaydell Harris was the top scorer for Classical, putting up 12 points. Daniella Jimenez had seven in the loss.\n\nCranston West’s offense was feeling good on Tuesday night.\n\nThe Falcons made seven 3-pointers … in the first quarter against the Rebels. The early shooting led to a 28-point frame as Cranston West toppled South Kingston, 74-36, on the road in a Division I matchup.\n\nCranston West finished with 13 treys in the game with Talya Walker (19 points) making five from distance. Kyla Buco (18 points) was right behind her with four makes from beyond the arc. Walker and Buco each made three triples in the opening frame.\n\nSaniyya Chase scored a dozen points and Madeleine Marques added 11 in the victory. It was the Falcons’ best offensive game of the season by a wide margin as the Falcons hadn’t broken 60 points yet this season. Might Tuesday’s win spark a run for Cranston West?\n\nAn important matchup with Westerly awaits on Saturday at home.\n\nIt was close all night, but Chariho pulled out a nailbiter vs. St. Raphael in Division I play.\n\nThe Chargers carried just a 6-point lead into the break and that was enough to hold off the Saints behind Tessa Aiello’s 16 points. With scoring contributions from six different players, the Chargers used their balanced attack to secure their fourth win of the year.\n\nMenuhki Harris managed a dozen points and had 10 fouls shots in the game as the junior was tough to defend. The Chargers added six points from the line in their decisive 14-point fourth quarter that helped keep them ahead.\n\nAdrianna Noka supplied eight points in the win. Tuesday was a key win at home for the Chargers as they travel to Westerly on Thursday night for a rivalry match. Chariho could play upset against the Bulldogs, who are looking like one of the best teams in the state to start the year.\n\nSRA was paced by 16 points from Carolyn Abreu. The Saints host West Warwick on Thursday.\n\nGenesis Castro scored a team-high 18 points, including 4 buckets from beyond the arc, and teammates Ella Martin and Faith Van Ness added 13 and 11 points, respectively, in the Eagles victory, as Barrington is now 10-1 and ranked second to only Westerly in Division I.\n\nFor the Patriots in the loss, Annie Hurd scored 16 points with 2 threes, Violet Silvia acced 11 points and 3 treys, and Gyselle Mairs finished with 10 points and 2 threes. Portsmouth slips to 5-2 on the season.\n\nThe Skippers wasted little time in dispatching the Rams in his Division I clash, racing out to a 24-3 advantage and playing a solid defensive game to cruise to victory. Brooke Faunce led the way with a game-high 16 points and Mya Macchioni added 8 more as North Kingstown pushed its record to 6-3 with its second win over La Salle (2-8) this season.\n\nFor the Rams, Maya Fernandes led the team with 6 points as La Salle gears up to face Portsmouth later this week.\n\nWesterly continues to prove it’s one of the state’s best programs.\n\nThe Bulldogs handled Pawtucket comfortably in a 65-23 victory on Tuesday night at home. Westerly assisted on 24 of its 27 field goals with Macy Antoch’s 14 points pacing the group. The freshman also supplied four rebounds and four steals in a standout night in the Division I matchup.\n\nDanica Jarrett was right behind her teammate with 13 points, five rebounds and a trio of steals. Cece Saint rounded out Westerly’s scorers in double figures with 10 points. But the standout performers don’t end there. Santanaa Hamelin supplied seven assists and seven steals as the freshman was all over the court.\n\nThe young, and talented, Bulldogs are now 9-1 overall on the year and host Chariho on Thursday.\n\nEast Providence girls basketball rebounded in a big way Tuesday night.\n\nThe Division II Townies managed a season-high 57 points in their 57-43 victory against Division I’s West Warwick. The win comes on the heels of EP losing to Rogers last Friday.\n\nZarae Hall got East Providence started hot with 14 points in the first half and finished off the Wizards with 24 in the game. The junior made 10 shots from the field, including a trio of 3-pointers to push EP to its fifth win of the season.\n\nTrinity Provencher added a dozen points, including eight in the fourth quarter to close out the hosts. Audrey Bernard supplied another dozen points as EP’s offense was firing on all cylinders. East Providence travels to Tiverton on Friday.\n\nWest Warwick was led by Brea Lima’s 18 points and Alexa Foley’s 14.The Wizards meet St. Raphael on Thursday in Pawtucket.\n\nThe Vikings believe in the old adage that you only get one chance to make a first impression. So opening the game with a 17-point first quarter, and then adding 18 in the second was pretty indicative of how this Division II contest would play out.\n\nRogers started hot and stayed that way. They were paced by the dynamic duo of Zaida Aponte – 21 points, including four 3's – and Tameka Robertson – 14 first half points. The result was a 35-17 lead by the break and an easier second half.\n\nFor the Mariners, Taylor Sullivan and Delaney Bonneau each scored 11 points, with Sullivan making a pair of 3-pointers and Bonneau going 6-fo-6 at the foul line.\n\nRogers moves to 4-2 and will have a stiff test coming later this week when it faces first-place Coventry (8-1).\n\nFreshman Eveisha Santana had a night to remember as she poured in 26 points, 6 from beyond the arc, pulled down 8 rebounds and had 5 steals and 4 assists to lead the Knights to a win over the Villa Novans. Also factoring in the win was Keeana Palmer who had 8 points, 5 boards, 3 steals and 4 assists. Central improved to 7-1 on the season.\n\nSkyla Caro topped Woonsocket in scoring with 11 points and teammate Akira Moise added 8 points in the loss.\n\nLincoln School 53, Mt. Hope, 29\n\nThe Cavaliers made it two in a row on back to back nights, matching last season's win total (three) in the young season. Juanita Sanchez was up 39-21 at the break and was never threatened in the second half\n\nThe Cavs were led by Geston Richardson with 25 points and Corey McClain, who added 17. Amaree Gomes and Allen Ortiz also scored in double figures in the win. The Patriots were led by James Nute (11 points) and Josh Morales (10).\n\nSmithfield 47, North Kingstown 40\n\n200 medley relay: Westerly - Enzo Gynther, Brady Casady, Sam Lorello, Colby Champlin, 1:57.38; 200 free: Westerly - Cooper Palumbo, 2:09.88; 200 IM: NP/S/NS - Mason Smith, 2:28.65; 50 free: Westerly - Champlin, 2:14.91; 100 fly: NP/S/NS - Sean Mania, 57:07; 100 free: Westerly - Lorello, 1:00.50; 500 free: NP/S/NS - Mason Smith, 5:52.82; 200 free relay: Westerly - Juan Aquino, Josue Aquino, Casady, Champlin, 1:56.85; 100 back: Westerly - Gynther, 1:07.82; 100 breast: NP/S/NS - Mania, 1:12:28; 400 free relay: NP/S/NS - Mania, Connor Farrell, Joshua Mesick, Smith, 4:00.43\n\n200 medley relay: NP/S/NS - Patty Oussi, Alexa Cortes, Emily Pace, Lauren Riley, 2:11.33; 200 free: Westerly - Avery Lamb, 2:20:38; 200 IM: NP/S/NS, Alexa Cortes, 2:26.37; 50 free: Westerly, Sonja Beasley, 26:20; 100 fly: NP/S/NS, Oussi, 1:09.45; 100 free: Westerly, Beasley, 58:08; 500 free: Westerly, Olivia ONeil, 6:07:11; 200 free relay:  Alexia McCabe, Peyton Pietraszka, O’Neil and Beasley, 1:52:50; 100 back: NP/S/NS, Oussi, 1:10.93; 100 breast: NP/S/NS, Cortes, 1:15.65; 400 free relay: Westerly - O’Neil, Lamb, McCabe and Beasley, 4:12:03.\n\nHannah Hochman had two wins in two individual events (100 Free, 100 breaststroke) and she also participated in the winning 200 Medley Relay, and teammate Samantha Lin also had two individual victories (200 IM, 100 butterfly) and she also swam a leg on the winning 200 Medley Relay helping the Titans edge the Patriots.\n\nFor Pilgrim, Juliana Kavanaugh also captured two individual events (200 free, 100 backstroke) she swam a leg for the winning 400 freestyle relay.\n\nClassical vs. Hendricken at Al Morro Athletic Complex, 6 p.m.\n\nChariho at Narragansett, 6 p.m.\n\nAchievement First (PVD) vs. Hope at 85 Garfield Ave. Cranston, RI, 6:30 p.m.\n\nJohnston at Burrillville, 6:30 p.m.\n\nMt.

American Fork didn’t need many outside shots to build its early 19-11 lead.\n\nThe lead only grew from there after Lone Peak attempted a full-court press and double-team heavy defense. Possession after possession, American Fork broke down the defense with smart passes, mostly through the high post.\n\nCenter Jax Clark made his presence known early by pulling in rebounds and getting easy buckets at the rim.\n\nThe Cavemen were playing fast and free, and nearly everyone on the court was getting action. American Fork sophomore Dieter Tuitavuki especially played well off the bench with 14 bench points, which includes three 3-pointers.\n\nSam Rutter, a smaller guard on the court, got an offensive rebound, putback, and then took a charge on the following defensive possession.\n\nThe fast and free offense even gave American Fork ample opportunities from beyond the arc, and the offense hit four in the second quarter alone.\n\nIt was plays like that which gave American Fork a dominant 39-18 lead at halftime.\n\n“We came out really hungry early, and we were aggressive, and we shot shots,” said American Fork head coach Ryan Cuff. “One thing about what you do when you press is that you get teams to continue to shoot shots and try to shoot out of it. I thought there were some shots that were rusty, but a lot of our shots were still layups. We controlled the tempo a little bit that way.”\n\nLone Peak continued its press-heavy defense into the second half with more success, but more importantly, it was finally hitting shots. Knights’ guard Saxon Young struggled with his shot at points of the game, but hit two threes in the third quarter.\n\nThe Knights’ offense scored 24 in the third quarter, but American Fork kept chugging along with 20 of its own. Utah State commit Bryce Mella played especially well by getting to the rim, scoring efficiently, and ended the night with 21 points.\n\nThe field goals were much harder to come by in the fourth quarter thanks to the Lone Peak defense, and for the first time since the first half, Lone Peak cut it to single digits.\n\nThat problem was made worse with errors at the free-throw line. However, American Fork made sure to seal the win by continuing to fight through the press and getting to the free-throw line.\n\n“They fought hard and give (Lone Peak) credit,” Cuff said. “We get up, and the thing that’s scary about getting up, you don’t want to celebrate. Not that we did, but sometimes you get that lead, and now you’re trying to protect it. I was proud of us. We kept attacking. We got layups when they were there.”\n\nThe win already gives American Fork sole control of the top spot in Region 3, but there’s still a lot of season to go. It beat Lehi in its region opener last week and will play Corner Canyon on Friday.",

    "fullText": "Ja Morant might be on the trade block and if so, will arguably be the hottest commodity on the market, with a host of teams reportedly willing to bring him on board. Of course, there is no certainty about where he will land, but Bam Adebayo may have just spoiled it for those who enjoy sudden bombshells dropped on social media.\n\nAdebayo hit a clutch three-pointer from the left wing that ultimately helped the Miami Heat beat the Phoenix Suns 127-121 on Tuesday night, and he celebrated by seemingly calling Morantover to South Beach. He copied Morant’s “grenade” celebration.\n\nWhen Morant first introduced the controversial celebration, he mimicked pulling the pin from a grenade and tossing it toward the crowd, then followed it up by covering his ears. The pin gesture eventually stopped, but the ear-covering did not. And Adebayo did just that.\n\nIt did not take long for the NBA community to realize that it was a nod to Ja, or at least that is what the majority believed. Morant’s celebrations are unique and not something others resort to on a daily basis. So, Adebayo doing it at a time when it is common knowledge that Morant could be on his way out of Memphis makes the idea that he is trying to lure Morant to Miami seem extremely plausible.\n\nThere have also been strong rumors linking Morant to the Heat, with NBA journalist Rachel Nichols even revealing that the franchise is interested in him. It would be an intriguing addition and would certainly inject some life into a Heat team that needs inspiration heading into the postseason.\n\nOn the other hand, Zach Lowe has explicitly stated that the Heat don’t want to sign the controversial superstar.\n\nMorant himself has not commented on the Heat at all. It remains to be seen whether these are merely murmurs or something more concrete, because a grenade celebration alone cannot determine a trade.\n\nAfter all, Jaren Jackson Jr. of the Grizzlies did the same celebration in Memphis’ last game. That does not mean Morant will now want to remain in Tennessee.\n\nThe post Bam Adebayo Hit With “Recruitment” Allegations After Hitting Ja Morant’s Celebration Amid Trade Rumors appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "description": "Giannis Antetokounmpo couldn’t remember hearing boos from his home crowd during his brilliant 13-year career in Milwaukee.

    "fullText": "MILWAUKEE (AP) — Giannis Antetokounmpo couldn’t remember hearing boos from his home crowd during his brilliant 13-year career in Milwaukee.\n\nIt happened Tuesday midway through the Bucks’ 139-106 loss to a Minnesota Timberwolves team that was playing without Anthony Edwards and Rudy Gobert.\n\n“I’ve never been a part of something like that before,” Antetokounmpo said after the game. “Something new for me.”\n\nThe two-time MVP responded the same way he has whenever he’s been booed on the road. After making a driving layup and drawing a foul in the opening minute of the third quarter, Antetokounmpo offered a thumbs-down gesture and booed back.\n\n“When I get booed, I boo back,” Antetokounmpo said. “I’ve been doing it all season.”\n\nThose boos poured down after Milwaukee trailed 76-45 at the break. Never before in franchise history had the Timberwolves built such a big halftime lead in a road game.\n\nAntetokounmpo acknowledged the Bucks’ effort was low Tuesday. He also expanded on why the boos bothered him.\n\n“I don’t think it’s fair,” Antetokounmpo said. “But everybody has their opinion to do what they want to do. I’m not going to tell them what to do and how they should act when we don’t play hard or win, or we lose games or we’re not where we’re supposed to be. And I don’t think anybody has the right to tell me how I should act on the basketball court after I’ve been here 13 years and I’m basically the all-time leader in everything.”\n\nThe Bucks’ latest loss came as they approach the midway point of a season that hasn’t met their expectations.\n\nMilwaukee (17-23) is 11th in the Eastern Conference standings, meaning the Bucks would have to rally in the second half just to reach the play-in round of the postseason. That’s a precipitous fall for a team that has made nine straight playoff appearances and won the NBA title in 2021.\n\nThe Bucks’ precarious position means they can’t afford to have performances like the one they delivered against a short-handed Minnesota team Tuesday. Milwaukee coach Doc Rivers blamed it on “dead legs” after the game, noting the Bucks had just returned from a four-game trip and are about to go back on the road for their next two contests.\n\n“Dead legs cannot be an excuse,” Antetokounmpo said. “We have to be better.”\n\nAntetokounmpo noted that the improvement must start with him, though he delivered 25 points, eight rebounds and five assists on Tuesday. He was asked how the Bucks could step up in the second half to put themselves back in playoff position.\n\n“Playing hard,” Antetokounmpo said. “Playing the right way. Playing selfless basketball, which we don’t. I don’t know. I really don’t know. Those three things are important. I know that they’re important for you to win. Right now there’s so many things that we can do better. Let’s just start by, ’Can we just play harder? Can we just play the right way? Can we create advantages for the next player? Can we just play for our teammate, play for the team, play for ourselves?' Let’s start with that, and I think everything will follow.”\n\nAntetokounmpo has offered similar messages after other losses this season, but the Bucks still haven’t put it all together. They haven’t won more than two straight games at any point this season.\n\n“Maybe we are not connected as much as we should,” Antetokounmpo said. “Maybe my voice is just a broken record and guys are just tired and guys might tend to do what they want to do. I don’t know. But as a leader, it doesn’t matter. Being a leader is the same thing as being a dad. You have to keep on being available, being consistent with your words and your actions over and over and over again. One day you hope the message is going to go through.”\n\nIn the meantime, Antetokounmpo says he will keep responding to boos the same way, no matter who’s doing the jeering.\n\n“I thrive through adversity,” Antetokounmpo said. “I thrive when people don’t believe in me. Doesn’t matter if I’m on the road, if I’m at home, if I’m at my family dinner, if I’m at a practice facility against my teammate.”\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

    "title": "Zach Hyman's Bizarre Scoring Streak: Three Goals, Eight Inches From The Net",
    "description": "Zach Hyman has been doing nothing but score lately. The catch? It's been in the strangest ways possible.",
    "fullText": "Zach Hyman has been doing nothing but score lately. The catch? It's been in the strangest ways possible.\n\nAgainst Chicago, he kicked the puck off his thigh and into the net. It was waived off, but still. Against Nashville tonight, he added two power play goals, both from right on top of the crease. His last three goals have come from a combined total of eight inches away from the net. He's not sniping from the circles or roofing backhands from the slot. He's camping in the blue paint, getting whacked, cross-checked, and somehow finding ways to jam pucks past goalies.\n\nFourteen goals in his last 17 games. That's a lot of production from a guy who wasn't scoring much at all early in the season after returning from injury.\n\nBut the Edmonton Oilers weren't worried. Not even a little bit.\n\nThe organization has analysts doing every job imaginable, tracking every stat any fan could ever want to know. One of those stats is expected goals—basically, a measure of the quality of scoring chances a player is generating based on shot location, type, and situation. And when Hyman wasn't scoring early on, his expected goals said he should have been. He was getting chances. High-quality chances. The puck just wasn't going in.\n\nKris Knoblauch had a simple take on it: Hyman was overdue, and when it started happening, watch out.\n\nFrom Rink Rats To NHLers: The Dad Trip Brings It Full Circle The <a href=\"https://thehockeynews.com/nhl/edmonton-oilers#google_vignette\">Edmonton Oilers</a>' dad trip started in Chicago yesterday and wraps up tonight in Nashville. It's one of those NHL traditions that doesn't get enough attention from the outside, but for the players and their fathers, it's special in a way that's hard to put into words.\n\nTurns out Knoblauch makes the big bucks for a reason. He was right. Once Hyman broke through, the floodgates opened. Now he can't stop scoring, even if those goals come from the most unglamorous spots on the ice.\n\nThat's Hyman's game. He doesn't score highlight-reel goals from the hashmarks. He scores garbage goals. Net-front scrambles. Deflections. Rebounds. Pucks that trickle through the goalie's pads while he's being cross-checked in the spine. It's not glamorous, but it works. Fourteen goals in 17 games proves that.\n\nUnfortunately, last night it wasn't enough. The Oilers played sloppy against Nashville. Turnovers they'd love to have back. Defensive breakdowns that cost them. Hyman did his part—two power play goals, both from right on top of the net—but the team couldn't overcome their own mistakes.\n\nOilers at Nashville: Pre-game Stats 23-16-7 | 53 PTS\n\nStill, Hyman's recent stretch is a reminder of what he brings to this team beyond just goals. He fights. He finishes checks. He screens goalies until they can't see anything. He gets to the net. He parks himself there and refuses to move. Honestly, if Connor McDavid asked him to throw on the goalie gear, he'd probably do it without hesitation.\n\nThat's the value of Zach Hyman. He does whatever it takes. When he wasn't scoring early in the season, he was still doing all the other stuff—forechecking, creating space for McDavid, battling in corners, killing penalties. The goals weren't coming, but the effort never wavered. And the Oilers knew, based on the underlying numbers, that eventually the puck luck would turn.\n\nBetter Than Advertised: Ingram's Play Forces Tough Questions in Edmonton Connor Ingram's performance Monday night against the Blackhawks was something else. When the <a href=\"https://thehockeynews.com/nhl/edmonton-oilers#google_vignette\">Edmonton Oilers</a> traded for him, I'll be the first to admit it: I didn't think he was the answer. I still don't think he's some saviour who's going to single-handedly carry this team to a Cup. But he's proven to be better than what we all gave him credit for. He can come in and win games for Edmonton. He's reliable. He's steady. He's the kind of goaltender that doesn't make Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl worry about what's happening behind them.\n\nExpected goals are a useful tool because they cut through short-term variance. Sometimes players go through stretches where they can't buy a goal despite doing everything right. Other times, players go on heaters that aren't sustainable based on the quality of their chances. Hyman's early-season drought was the former. His current run is the payoff. He was generating quality chances all along; now they're actually going in.\n\nAnd they're going in from ridiculous distances. Three goals from a combined eight inches away. That's absurd. He's made a living this season out of being in the exact spot goalies hate most: right on top of them, stick on the ice, ready to bang home anything that comes near the crease.\n\nThe Oilers need that. McDavid and Draisaitl can create offence from anywhere on the ice, but having a guy who's willing to pay the price in front of the net is invaluable. Hyman absorbs punishment, battles through cross-checks, and still finds ways to get his stick on pucks. It's a skillset that doesn't always show up in highlight packages, but it wins games.\n\nLike Father, Like Son: Leon Draisaitl's Hockey DNA Runs Deep Leon Draisaitl is one of the best players in the NHL. He's a perennial Hart Trophy candidate, a scoring machine, and Connor McDavid's partner in crime on one of the most dangerous duos in hockey. But before all that, he was just a kid hanging around the rink, watching his dad play.\n\nThe other night in Nashville, it almost did. Two power play goals from Hyman, both from his office right on the goal line. But sloppy play elsewhere cost the Oilers. Sometimes that happens. The good news? Hyman's rolling. Fourteen goals in 17 games, with no signs of slowing down.\n\nKnoblauch called it. Hyman was overdue. Now he's cashing in. And as long as he keeps parking himself inches from the net, the goals will keep coming—no matter how weird they look.\n\nBookmark The Hockey News Edmonton Oilers team site to never miss the latest news, game-day coverage, and more.   Add us to your Google News favourites, and never miss a story.",

    "fullText": "UConn coach Dan Hurley has won two of the last three NCAA Tournaments and believes he has yet another team capable of cutting down the nets in April in Indianapolis.\n\nYet there’s one team he wouldn’t want to see in the first round of the Big Dance: his alma mater.\n\n“I wouldn’t want to see Seton Hall’s name drawn next to mine in the NCAA Tournament, I’ll tell you that,” Hurley said after his No. 3 Huskies snapped a four-game losing streak in Newark with a 69-64 win over the No. 25 Pirates.\n\n“That’s an excellent team,” added Hurley, whose own team (17-1, 7-0 Big East) has won 13 straight dating to a Nov. 19 loss to current No. 1 Arizona. “That’s a team that’s going to be right there for the Big East regular season, Big East Tournament. And that’s going to be a tough team to beat in the NCAA Tournament.”\n\nFinal: No. 3 UConn 69, No. 25 Seton Hall 64\n\nThe Huskies snap a 4-game losing in Newark and Alex Karaban gets his 1st win here\n\nThe Hall proved they can hang with one of the best teams in the country after getting down double-digits\n\n— Adam Zagoria (@AdamZagoria) January 14, 2026\n\nAfter falling behind yet again in a Big East game and trailing by as many as 18 in the second half, the Pirates closed to within 65-64 on a corner 3-pointer by Mike Williams.\n\nWilliams (16 points) had another look to tie the game at 67, but was blocked by Braylon Mullins.\n\nThe Hall had no answer for 6-11 big man Tarris Reed Jr., who went for 21 points and 11 boards against the smaller Pirates front line. Karaban added 13 points in his first win at Prudential Center, and Mullins 11.\n\n“I’m just proud we got a Big East win and it’s definitely nice to win here,” Karaban said.\n\nThe good news for the Pirates (14-3, 4-2 Big East) is they roared back yet again after getting down early.\n\nThe bad news is they missed 10 foul shots (15-of-25) and were a woeful 1-of-16 from deep.\n\n“I don’t know, man,” Pirates coach Shaheen Holloway lamented. “I mean, here’s the craziest thing. In our new gym, our great, beautiful practice facility, we don’t miss free throws. We don’t miss 3-pointers. We can’t seem to make them [in games], so I don’t know.”\n\nThe Hall’s emotional leader, Budd Clark, fouled out with 12 points and 4 rebounds but wasn’t feeling any moral victories after giving the No. 3 team in the nation a serious run for its money.\n\n“We’re not here for moral victories,” Clark said. “We feel like we could beat anybody.”\n\nStill, Holloway knew this was a golden opportunity for a “massive” NCAA Tournament resume and league win that slipped away.\n\n“It’s disappointing because opportunities like this don’t come around too often at home,” he said.\n\nThe Hall needs to get some wins during the season against UConn, St. John’s and Villanova, the league’s other three top teams. So far they are 0-2 against Villanova and UConn with a date against St. John’s coming up Tuesday at Madison Square Garden after a home tilt Saturday with Butler.\n\n“Everybody doubts them and they continue to stay together and be the toughest,” UConn’s Karaban said of The Hall. “… They block out the outside noise every single year and it’s always a tough team to play against.”\n\nHolloway appreciated Hurley’s high praise for his team, but said he’s not getting too far ahead of himself.\n\n“I’m just worried about Butler,” he said, “I’m not worried about the NCAA Tournament.”",

    "fullText": "The Oklahoma City Thunder finally picked up their first win against the San Antonio Spurs, and it took them four games to do it. The defending champions breathed a huge sigh of relief after avoiding a regular-season sweep, but Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, true to his confident self, declared that the game was not as important as the external noise made it seem.\n\nBefore the Thunder’s first loss to the Spurs, they looked seemingly unbeatable, barring flukes. But Victor Wembanyama and company exposed glaring flawsand showed the league that beating them was possible. Gilgeous-Alexander, after finally avoiding defeat against the Frenchman, admitted that the Thunder did not see this coming.\n\nThe Spurs made them uncomfortable, but the reigning MVP feels that it was how they grew as a team. That’s what ultimately led them to their 119-98 win earlier today.\n\n*“They got the better of us the last three times we played them [and] that doesn’t happen to this group,”* Gilgeous-Alexander said.* “I can’t remember the last time its happened. But yeah, uncomfortable feelings and adversity is where you find growth that defines who you are.”*\n\n“And we showed that tonight,” the Canadian star added, before taking a dig at the magnitude of the occasion for the Spurs.\n\n*“Tonight wasn’t our super bowl. It wasn’t anything but another game in an 82 game season. We gotta [keep] finding ways to be better.” *\n\nWas this Gilgeous-Alexander trying to be nonchalant? Perhaps. Losing to a team four times in a regular season would have clearly shown the rest of the NBA that the Spurs were a true kryptonite for the Thunder. And although it does not matter in the long run, no team would want that next to its record.\n\nThe discussion will be over for now. The Thunder showed that they can beat the Spurs. Next, they may meet in the post-season where winning actually means more. If the Thunder fail there, Gilgeous-Alexander’s “this wasn’t our superbowl” comment would surely be revisited.\n\nThunder vs Spurs may very well be the NBA’s next big rivalry.\n\nThe post “Tonight Wasn’t Our Super Bowl”: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Trolls Spurs After 21-Point Blowout Win appeared first on The SportsRush.",

Levis does not have any professional ties to the Anaheim area - he grew up in Massachusetts and played college football at Penn State and Kentucky.\n\nIn 2024, Levis appeared at Bridgestone Arena before a Predators playoff game, kissing a catfish on the Ford Band Stage.\n\nLevis, 26, last played for the Titans in 2024. That season he finished with a 2-10 record, throwing for 2,091 yards, 13 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. In the offseason, Levis had surgery to repair his shoulder, which resulted in him missing the 2025 season.\n\nLevis was drafted in the second round of the 2023 NFL Draft and started nine games his rookie season.

He arrives in El Paso after spending the past five years as president of Monterey Bay FC, another club competing in the USL Championship.\n\nGonzalez brings 25 years of coaching experience, with stops across Major League Soccer, the USL Championship and MLS NEXT Pro. Most recently, he served as head coach of LAFC II.\n\nGonzalez becomes the fifth head coach in El Paso Locomotive FC history.\n\nBoth DiGiulio and Gonzalez expressed excitement about leading the next chapter of the club as the Locomotive continue building their roster ahead of the 2026 season.\n\n“I’m extremely excited,” Gonzalez said. “I’ve been in quite a long journey, and I’ve been in many different environments for this opportunity, and I don’t take it lightly to be part of the community of El Paso. And our goal is to have success and win trophies, but also to develop young and veteran players to become a team and be good in the community.”\n\n“I have a real love for the sport,” DiGiulio said. “I have a real love for the league. I think the USL is a tremendous opportunity in the future. I believe what we have coming in the next several years is going to be special. My goal and our goal is to be one of those clubs that are the elite thought of clubs in USL.”\n\nEl Paso will open the season on March 7, hosting Colorado Springs Switchbacks FC at Southwest University Park.",

    "description": "Dillon Brooks picked up his league-leading 14th technical foul on Tuesday, Jan. 13, which still leaves him work to do to set the single-season record.",
    "fullText": "Phoenix Suns guard Dillon Brooks picked up his league-leading 14th technical foul of the season on Tuesday, Jan. 13, and two more will lead to an automatic one-game suspension.\n\nThat seems inevitable, but making history will take work.\n\nBrooks leads Draymond Green and Luka Doncic, each who have nine technical fouls apiece this season. Yet Brooks must accelerate his pace to set the single-season technical fouls record.\n\nThat mark belongs to Rasheed Wallace, the retired center who amassed 41 technical fouls during the 2000-01 season when he was playing for the Portland Trail Blazers. Consider this: That means on average Wallace got whistled for a tech every other game during the 82-game regular season.\n\nBrooks’ latest tech came during the Suns’ 127-121 loss to the Miami Heat. That gives him 14 technicals through 40 games for an average of about one technical foul every three games. To catch Wallace, he’ll need 27 techs over the final 42 games of the regular season, an average of .64 technical fouls per game.\n\nEven if the record eludes him, Brooks has established himself as a player adept at drawing technical fouls. He had a career high of 18 technical fouls during the 2022-23 season when he was playing for the Memphis Grizzlies, and he has at least 11 technical fouls over each of the past six seasons.\n\nNot that all of them are deserved. That is, according to Brooks.\n\n\"They give me a (technical) for who I am,'' Brooks said after picking up his 13th technical foul against the Washington Wizards on Jan. 11, according to Sports Illustrated. \"That's weird and that's unappreciative.''\n\nBrooks will be facing a disadvantage Wallace didn’t during his record-breaking season.\n\nBefore the 2005-2006 season, the NBA implemented the rule that a 16th technical foul triggered an automatic one-game suspension. But during the 2000-01 season, Wallace drew whistle after whistle without worrying about an automatic suspension.\n\nThough Brooks has earned attention for his penchant for technical fouls, he’s helped lead the Suns (24-16) as the team’s second-leading scorer with 21.1 points per game and stellar defense.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Can Dillon Brooks break NBA record for technical fouls?",

    "description": "Booing from Bucks fans as the team walked off the court at halftime down 31 to Minnesota didn't sit well with GIannis Antetokounmpo",
    "fullText": "The fans booed the Milwaukee Bucks on Tuesday night Jan. 13 for their dispirited, dismal first half at Fiserv Forum against Minnesota.\n\nAnd Giannis Anteokounmpo booed right back.\n\nThe Bucks walked off the court at halftime trailing 76-45 to the Minnesota Timberwolves, who were playing without Anthony Edwards and Rudy Gobert, and a loud portion of the crowd started booing, which grew in tone.\n\nThen in the third quarter Antetokounmpo hit a shot and gave the thumbs down back to the fans, something he's done before (at Indiana, for example, after seeing teammate Myles Turner getting booed).\n\nBut this wasn't a gesture to the opposing fans.\n\nFULL MOMENT: Giannis boos back at Bucks crowd during blowout pic.twitter.com/MyShKbaYcE\n\n— NBAbzy (@nbabzyy) January 14, 2026\n\nAntetokounmpo said he can’t ever remember being booed at home.\n\n“Never… Just kind of a new for me.\n\n“I thrive through adversity, I thrive when people don’t believe in me. It doesn't matter if I'm on the road, if I'm at home, if I'm on my family dinner, if I'm practicing with my teammate, it doesn't really matter.”\n\n“So, yeah, I've never been a part of something like that before, so it's something new for me. I like, though. I love it.”\n\nWhen asked about it a bit more, to clarify, Antetokounmpo was clearly offended by the fans who chose to boo him and his team and coaching staff.\n\n“I was definitely booing back. When I get booed, I boo back. I've been doing it all season. You guys haven’t been with me on the road,\" said Antetokounmpo, referring to local reporters who cover the Bucks at home but not road games. \"Whenever I get booed, I boo back.”\n\nBut this is home, this is different...\n\n“I does not matter,\" responded Antetokounmpo.\n\n“No, no, it does not matter. It doesn't matter, I play basketball for my teammates,\" said Antetokounmpo. \"I play basketball for myself and my family. When people don't believe in me, I don't tend to be with them. I tend to be against them. I tend to do what I'm here to do, what I'm good at, right?\n\n\"I think I'm like a maverick. I've always been that way, so won't change now, it doesn’t matter if I am home, away.\n\n“But, yeah, I've never been a part of something like that before, and I don't think it's fair. I don't.\n\n“But everybody has the opinion to do what they want to do; I'm not gonna tell them what to do or how to act when we don't play hard, we lose games, or maybe not where we're supposed to be.\n\n“And I don't think anybody has the right to tell me how I should act on the basketball court after I have been here 13 years. And I’m basically the all-time leader in everything.”\n\nThis was the sad ending of a game that the Bucks could not compete in on any level. Defensively, Milwaukee couldn't contest shots. Offensively, players could not match Minnesota's ability to score. I was one of the worst losses of the season, and that's saying something.\n\nThroughout Antetokounpo's return to play after an injured calf had sidelined him, he's been trying to take the most positive and authoritative tone in his post-game press conferences. He hasn't criticized his team, his coaches, the GM's roster or any decisions.\n\nBut this loss, a 139-106 thrashing, was so bad that coach Doc Rivers pulled his starters with 9 minutes to go, waiving the white flag. Milwaukee had just returned from a four game road trip and Rivers offered that as the reason for a completely lackluster performance for everyone.\n\nRivers' press conference was before Antetkounmpo spoke to reporters, and Rivers, simply said the reason was dead legs.\n\nBut Antetokounmpo wasn’t taking that free pass.\n\n“Effort was low for sure. It’s going to be nights like that in the NBA. I’ve been a part of not many, but I understand there’s going to be times that we might come out flat,\" said Antetokounmpo. \"And there's gonna be a team that going to come out with a lot of energy, should the crap out of the ball. And don't give you no life.”\n\nAgain, Antetokounmpo tried his best to be diplomatic by answering questions without shredding his teammates confidence.\n\n“I think we didn't play hard. I think we didn’t do the right things. We didn’t play as a team. There's not much you can take it from this game, either,\" said Antetokounmpo. \"You gotta, like, kind of... forget about it. Take the things you didn’t do well, try to improve on it. And go to the next one. But again, at the end of the day, effort was low, you cannot have that.\n\n“There's so many things that we can do better. But let's just start by... Can we just play harder? Can you just play the right way?”\n\nAgain, Antetokounmpo was pressed a bit on this issue. A team can lose because it is so fatigued there is nothing left in the body to compete with.\n\nOr, a team can lose because of it's own self sabotage, or, lack of effort.\n\n“I don't think it's dead legs. I don't think its dead legs. I don't think it's dead legs,” he said three times.\n\nAnd then he said it again. “Come on man.”\n\n“Were we tired? Yeah, yeah, a little bit. By the day, obviously. We wasn't on the gym. I don't see the reason. First of all, when I talk, I talk about myself too, right?\n\n“I always myself first. So I don't see the reason that I wasn't more aggressive, I wasn't defensively more aware. I wasn’t more, going down hill, making plays more. I don’t see the reason.\n\n“So, it's not dead legs. I'm never gonna say I didn't have legs. I’m always going to say that I could do things better. My effort wasn't there, maybe I wasn't as focused as I should. And then after that, when I look at myself, I look at over all the team, well, we can do better, but I don't think it's dead legs.\n\n“Dead legs can not be an excuse. We have to be better.”\n\nThis article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Giannis takes booing from Bucks fans personally, returns the gesture",

    "fullText": "Chelsea head coach Liam Rosenior has seemingly made a call about whether Cole Palmer will be playing tonight against Arsenal.\n\nAs we know, Palmer has been struggling with a groin issue for some time now, and recently, it kept him out for a good chunk of time.\n\nSince returning to the pitch, Palmer hasn’t quite looked the same confident top player that we have all grown used to seeing in a Chelsea shirt. And this had many wondering whether he is fully recovered yet or whether the injury might still be causing him some issues.\n\nAnd it looks like there might be something to the latter, because if Rosenior’s latest hints are anything to go by, Palmer will not be playing at all tonight, let alone starting, as Chelsea prepare to welcome Arsenal in the first leg of the League Cup semi finals.\n\nCole Palmer in action for Chelsea. (Photo by Shaun Botterill/Getty Images)\n\nSpeaking to the Chelsea website late last night, Rosenior said on Cole Palmer:\n\n“My job is to get to know him, to connect with him and to understand what gets the best out of him.\n\n“That takes time. I’m just super excited to work with him. The scary thing with Cole is that he’s already got world-class ability, but he’s just 23 years old.\n\n“He’s got so much more and there were moments of genius against Fulham; when he stepped over the ball to put Liam [Delap] in on goal, there was also a pass to Pedro (Neto) which was ridiculous. I can’t wait to work with him on a regular basis.\n\n“I had a really good in-depth conversation with Cole [on Monday], I’ve had a good in-depth conversation with the medical team, and we’re at a stage of the season where we’ve got another eight games in four weeks, so it’d be crazy for me to risk any player in this phase of the season.\n\n“I have real faith in this group and they showed that against Charlton. We made eight changes and we had a good performance. I’ll make more changes for Wednesday and I’ll make more changes on Saturday.\n\n“To risk a player’s health in January is a crazy thing to do if you have the ambition that you want to be strong at the end of the season.”\n\nWest Ham are reportedly interested in signing Chelsea goalkeeper Filip Jorgensen in the January transfer window.\n\nRio Ferdinand has demanded that Liam Rosenior changes this one thing in his attack moving forward, in his latest comments picked up by us.",

    "title": "On This Day (14 Jan 1978): A Penalty, A Debut, And A Barking Dog!",
    "description": "An away trip to the East End of London was not always the most welcoming of prospects, but this game offered a little bit of everything that makes football such an experience in the broadest sense!",
    "fullText": "The 1977/78 season had not quite gone to plan for Jimmy Adamson. The unbelievable run-in to the previous season as we attempted to preserve our hard-won top-tier status – though in the end unsuccessful – had left many of us feeling we were only a couple of players away from having a squad good enough to return to the First Division at the first time of asking.\n\nFor the best part of the season our inability to put together successive victories as well as win away from Roker Park was a perplexing fact of this campaign. On a personal level being a regular at away games as well as Roker Park was a resilience- and stamina-building experience that has served me well into my older years as victories turned into draws and draws turned into defeats on the road!\n\nOrient were the opposition and Brisbane Road the venue as we ventured into 1978. I loved an away trip to London and Inter-City from Central Station was one of the more pleasurable modes of transport to a game (certainly knocking bells out of sitting on a crate in the back of a white van). Getting across London to whichever ground we were going to was the risky element of such trips but it all seemed worth it at the time and we were not to be disappointed on this occasion.\n\nGames against Orient I had generally found entertaining affairs. An added ingredient in this current Orient team was the marvellously talented winger John Chiedozie. Young, pacey, elusive and with a really good temperament the Nigerian international was a player to covet.\n\nHe also was one of the few wingers I saw regularly trouble one of my favourite ever full-backs Joe Bolton. I had been looking forward to seeing Joe pit his defensive wit and ferocious ability to put a flyer into the paddock if required before realising the day before the game that my cult hero was suspended and another handy youngster Tim Gilbert would take his place.\n\nOrient were no one-man team though and their manager Jimmy Bloomfield usually had them playing attractive attacking football. The leading goal-scorer in the second tier at that point was Peter Kitchen on fourteen goals. A Sunderland legend Stan Anderson had warned us in the local press in the run-up to this game to ignore him at our peril. He had sold him to Orient as Doncaster manager and rated him as a real threat. Glen Roeder would also play in the centre of defence; he was a stylish defender whose pace, positional sense and ability to use the ball well out of defence had always caught my eye when we played against him. Eire international Tony Grealish was a handful in midfield and Derek Clarke would also be in the O’s line-up. He was one of the five footballing Clarke brothers who always intrigued me. His brother Allan had played for Leeds against us in the 1973 FA Cup final and was probably the most successful of the quintet.\n\nBobby Fisher also played for Orient and apart from my youthful mistake in thinking he was also a Grand Chess Master this lad was often the victim of some brutal racist abuse; he was mixed-race and Jewish and to their detriment this seemed to especially aggravate some of the less tolerant who watched football at that time. Apart from being a handy enough full-back Fisher did not let the bigots hold him back; after his career in football he went on to become a TV actor (as well as an anti-racist campaigner) appearing in shows like The Manageress, Space Precinct and Star Hunter. Good on him!\n\nSunderland had their difficulties coming into this game. Ever-present Jackie Ashurst had gone down with flu so a late call-up was sixteen-year-old Rob Hindmarch. Coming from Morpeth I was especially chuffed at this debut; Ashurst would be a miss but Rob was from Stannington just outside of Morpeth and we were claiming him as one of our own “Morpeth Gadgies”.\n\nAnother player missing would be Mick Docherty (who had played his way into my affections since his transfer from Man City the previous season); a persistent knee injury was troubling the versatile leader on the park. Thankfully Bobby Kerr was back in the fold and would have a really good game to mark his return. Young forward and recent signing Roly Gregoire was added to the squad for this game and would be an unused substitute.\n\nMy journey from King’s Cross to Brisbane Road was typically not without its moments as traversing the underground, avoiding roaming bands of West Ham and Chelsea hoodlums and not for the first time falling into the trap of thinking once you are at King’s Cross you are almost at your destination all melded into an experience that would have prepared me as a contestant in Race Across the World had I the inclination today!\n\nOur away support in London games was always bolstered by exiles and there was close to two thousand of us making a bit of a racket as the game approached kick-off.\n\nMuch to our amusement a dog had gotten onto the pitch and was doing a marvellous job evading stewards, police and club officials to such an extent I contemplated writing to Jimmy Adamson to suggest the mongrel would make a handy addition to our forward line options.\n\nThe game had no sooner kicked off than it was stopped by the referee. To my initial excitement it looked like referee Tom Reynolds had sent the O’s keeper John Jackson off! At this point in the campaign I was ready to pounce on any advantage for my team and whilst cheering the “sending off” I freely admit I had no idea why this was the case. However notwithstanding my errant sense of fair-play it eventually became clear it was Jackson’s blue jersey which was the problem for the referee; it was clashing with our blue away jersey. Jackson returned to the field resplendent in a more traditional keeper’s jersey and to the satisfaction of the referee. In almost six decades of watching my team I had never seen this happen before or since.\n\nWith the game finally underway we made a really good start. With Bobby Kerr, Shaun Elliott, Wilf Rostron and Gary Rowell controlling midfield and Rob Hindmarch policing the dangerman Kitchen to good effect we had the majority of possession and moved the ball about the park smartly.\n\nAround thirteen minutes in Grealish misfired a pass straight to Bobby Kerr who looked up and played Gary Rowell into space as he raced into the box. Whether it was Grealish or Fisher who up-ended Rowell was hard to see from my position but the referee had no doubts about what the tackle deserved and awarded a penalty.\n\nThe season had started with Jackie Ashurst the nominated penalty taker; he had a thunderous shot and had scored a penna’ against Orient in the game at Roker Park earlier in the season. Gary Rowell had taken over the role and I had watched him score a penalty in three successive games in December. He looked nerveless taking these awards and combined unerring accuracy with a bit of power and as he picked himself up from the turf I was already anticipating taking a deserved lead in this game.\n\nThere was nothing in his run-up prior to this penalty that was any different to his previous successful attempts or anything different to any subsequent penalties (and I saw a number of them) that would account for him squeaking the ball the wrong side of the post. It was disappointing but unbeknown to us at the time it would be his sole penalty miss of twenty-six taken in his Sunderland career as he wrote himself into our record books with the most successful conversion rate of 96% in front of Tony Towers and Billy Clunas.\n\nThe game progressed with Sunderland still dominating the ball and looking the most likely team to score. The only real danger was coming from Chiedozie who was giving Mick Henderson and Tim Gilbert a bit of trouble as he alternated down either flank.\n\nWe arrived at half-time with no score courtesy of a couple of canny saves from Barry Siddall and an excellent interception from Hindmarch who had not given Kitchen a sniff in the first forty-five minutes. Despite our penalty miss I felt we were still well into this game; we just needed to get a little bit more from our front two of Lee and Holden!\n\nFor those that watched our two lanky strikers play together it is fair to say that Mel Holden was an out-and-out centre-forward. Bob Lee on the other hand offered a bit of variety as he would often drift into the midfield areas sometimes dragging his marker with him creating space for the likes of Gary Rowell and Wilf Rostron to “ghost” into. Lee was very tidy on the ball and whilst I sometimes felt he lacked a bit of aggression for a “big fella” he had some really nice touches and was utilised in midfield during his time with Sunderland.\n\nWithin minutes of the restart Wilf Rostron had seen two attempts go mighty close. A lob just cleared the crossbar and had Jackson scrambling and an angled shot pulled a cracking save out of the over-worked keeper.\n\nOn sixty minutes O’s manager Jimmy Bloomfield tried to change the pattern of the game by bringing off Derek Clarke and sending on experienced utility player David Payne to try and shore up the midfield. It did produce a change; on sixty-two minutes we scored! A Bobby Kerr corner kick was pinged into the box and produced a mighty melee with all our big men (Lee, Holden, Hindmarch and Jeff Clarke) in the eighteen-yard box. The ball eventually arrived at Jeff Clarke’s right foot about seven yards out from the back post. Like a seasoned forward he smashed the ball into the goal for his first ever Sunderland goal. We deserved this lead and boy did we celebrate it!\n\nThe game continued with Sunderland looking more likely to add to their lead when on seventy-three minutes there ensued one of the most bonkers five minutes of football I might have ever seen!\n\nIt started with Peter Kitchen who for just about the only time in the game eluded Rob Hindmarch, slalomed round Jeff Clarke and ran the ball into our net past a stranded Siddall for the equaliser.\n\nA minute later Gary Rowell danced along the eighteen-yard line before placing a sharp well-directed shot (a typical Gary Rowell shot from outwith the box) that nestled into the corner of Jackson’s goal to retake the lead and give him his twelfth goal of the season as well as make up for his penalty miss.\n\nWe were still celebrating Rowell’s cracker when an Orient corner kick seemed to evade a host of bodies as it somehow got to our back post. Moving smartly in the O’s best player on the day Chiedozie tapped the ball into our net for the equaliser.\n\nIt was an incredible passage of play and it wasn’t finished yet as almost straight from the kick-off the ball worked its way through Elliott, Kerr and Rowell to Bob Lee approximately eight yards out. He absolutely hammered a shot that looked a certainty and had my arms aloft in the away end only for Jackson to pull off another cracking save.\n\nFor the last fifteen minutes we did everything but score as Kerr put a good shot just over the bar and Mel Holden executed a perfect scissors kick that just grazed the bar. Holden looked like the most graceful giraffe you ever saw doing ballet as he pivoted and leapt; it was astounding to behold!\n\nThen another fantastic passage of interplay saw Bobby Kerr zip a low cross into the box for Gary Rowell to meet it almost horizontally (a typical Gary Rowell diving header) that Jackson just got a fingertip to. It was a breathtaking finale as the game finished with Orient perhaps a tad lucky to get a share of the points.\n\nThe Lads had played really well but actually dropped a position to eleventh in an eventful game that saw Jeff Clarke score the first of his six goals for us in a highly regarded Sunderland career and Gary Rowell miss the only penalty of the twenty-six he took for Sunderland.\n\nAs for the young debutant and Morpeth Gadgie Rob Hindmarch went on to become Sunderland’s youngest ever captain at nineteen years old. He was a hard centre-half who had all the attributes of a top-class defender: good aerial strength, strong tackler, fairly quick across the grass and a good ability to clear his lines. He allied all these skills with a cracking attitude to the game and a real leader on the pitch. In 1978 he would earn five England Youth caps and go on to make one hundred and twenty-eight appearances for the Lads ninety-one of these in the top tier as he became an intrinsic part of the team and defence for five seasons.\n\nIn 1984 new Sunderland manager Lenny Ashurst decided he could do without the services of Hindmarch. It seemed a daft decision at the time and looks no better with the benefit of hindsight as he allowed him to go for free. Hindmarch signed for Derby and became something of a cult hero as he captained them to two successive promotions into the top tier. He then signed for Wolves in 1990 and was appointed club captain but only spent one season at Molineux.\n\nIt is a poignant fact that the Sunderland team that took the field at Orient in 1978 contained three young men that would see their lives cut short. Both Rob Hindmarch and Mel Holden were diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease. Mel Holden died in January 1981 aged twenty-six years and Rob Hindmarch in November 2002 aged forty-one. Both left a wife and young children. Tim Gilbert too would pass far too young in May 1995 aged thirty-six of a heart attack. Three fine players to have graced our colours on this day at Brisbane Road.\n\nDivision Two Date – 14.01.1978 Venue – Brisbane Road Attendance – 6,737\n\nGoalscorers – Clarke 62 mins; Kitchen 73 mins; Rowell 74 mins; Chiedozie 75 mins\n\nOrient – Jackson; Fisher; Roffey; Bennett; Hoadley; Roeder; Chiedozie; Gray; D Clarke (Payne 60 mins); Kitchen; Grealish.

    "fullText": "No. 2 Iowa State took its first loss of the season against Kansas on Tuesday, by enough points that it could very well count for two.\n\nThe unranked Jayhawks bulldozed the Cyclones 84-63 at The Phog, in the kind of way that an uninformed observer would just assume they were the second-best team in the country. Tre White led all scorers with 19 points on 6-of-13 shooting with 10 rebounds (6 offensive) and 3 assists, while star freshman Darryn Peterson had 16 points.\n\nMelvin Council Jr. also had 15 points and 7 rebounds, along with the early wake-up call.\n\nBOOM pic.twitter.com/ylRHBk65fe\n\n— Kansas Men’s Basketball (@KUHoops) January 14, 2026\n\nKansas was up double digits midway through the fourth quarter and up by 21 at halftime. Iowa State made a push early in the second half, but the deficit never slipped below double-digits.\n\n\"I thought the intensity was great. I hoped we showed some toughness,\" Kansas coach Bill Self said. \"Other than that seven minutes to start the second half, we played great the whole time. We shared it, were aggressive, and our defense was above what it has been.\"\n\nThe Cyclones were cold across the floor on offense as well as mistake-prone, with leading scorer and All-America candidate Joshua Jefferson posting only 12 points on 4-of-14 shooting with 8 rebounds and 5 turnovers. Meanwhile, Kansas shot 50.8% from the field and 50% from 3-point range, with only 9 turnovers.\n\nIowa State going down narrows the list of undefeated men's Division I teams down to four: No. 1 Arizona, No. 8 Nebraska, No. 10 Vanderbilt and Miami (OH). The previously dominant Michigan received its first loss only two days earlier at home against Wisconsin.\n\nIt had been a rough go lately for Kansas, falling out of the AP Top 25 this week after losses to unranked UCF and West Virginia in its past three games. Had they lost Tuesday, it would have been their first 1-3 start in conference play since the 1987-88 season.\n\nInstead, Tuesday was a reminder they still have the talent to be dangerous.",

    "fullText": "With all of the talented 5A girls basketball teams in Utah, the Olympus Titans have quietly been making a move to be included among them.\n\nThe Titans took another big step Tuesday evening. Led by Kya Newton and Cammie Bontempo, Olympus stayed undefeated in Region 6 play with a 55-45 win over Alta on the Hawks’ home court in Sandy.\n\nNewton led with 23 points, and Bontempo had 11 points and a career-high 21 rebounds as the Titans used a 11-0 scoring burst in the second quarter to build a nice lead they never relinquished.\n\n“Cammie was a beast,” said Olympus coach Whitney Jenkins. “She and Kya were all over the court and they took over our offense when we needed it. We had some turnovers, but I was OK with it because we trying to set up our players for layups.”\n\nWith its ninth straight win, Olympus improved to 11-2 overall and 4-0 in region, and it sets up a potentially exciting home battle at 5:15 p.m. Friday against third-ranked Bountiful (also unbeaten in region).\n\nWith the Titans’ boys program being the defending state champ and slated to play host to the Redhawks immediately afterward, the Holladay school might be a busy place that day.\n\n“(Tuesday’s win) sets up a big game,” Jenkins said. “This is such a tough region, and we know the road (to the title) has to go through Bountiful. We knew it had to go through Alta, too. They are so tough and have so many seniors; we just made the plays when we had to.”\n\nBoth Olympus and Alta started slowly but the game initially moved in the Titans’ favor thanks to the hustle of Bontempo, a 5-foot-7 senior who had more rebounds (17) than the entire Alta team by halftime. The game was tied 12-12 early in the second quarter when Olympus earned its big lead, and Bontempo helped with several offensive boards that led to baskets during a four-minute span when the Hawks went scoreless.\n\nNewton, meanwhile, anchored the team’s offense. The 5-foot-4 senior is the Titans’ leading scorer at 20.8 points per game. She moved from the Mountain Ridge area last summer and played a big enough role on Olympus’ soccer team last fall to earn a scholarship to Utah State.\n\nOn this night, Newton made 7 of 16 shots (with a pair of 3-pointers) and added 7 of 10 free throws. She also asked to control the ball in the final minutes to help Olympus withstand Alta’s last rally.\n\nAlta didn’t go quietly. The Hawks, who came into the game in a three-way tie with Bountiful and Olympus, came back behind Alia Baldassano, who had 17 points, and Olivia Stephens, who added 12.\n\nAlta got to within eight points in the fourth quarter until running out of time. The Hawks (12-2, 3-1) will have a chance to stay close in the region race when they travel to Bountiful Jan. 20.",

However, as there was no buy option or obligation included by either side in the terms, the Cameroonian will return to Old Trafford once his temporary deal expires and negotiate his next steps.\n\nFrom his point of view, he hopes that he can continue in M16.\n\nOnana is tied to United until 2028, potentially even 2029, given the one-year option in his contract.\n\n(Photo by Stu Forster/Getty Images)\n\nAccording to the iPaper, sources close to the 29-year-old believe that ‘if a head coach comes in who favours goalkeepers playing the ball out with their feet – like Xavi – they may turn to the Trabzonspor loanee once more’.\n\nUltimately, you’d imagine Onana is only setting himself up for disappointment.\n\nUnited are beyond pleased with how Senne Lammens has adapted to the English top flight and established himself as a reliable shot-stopper, leaving no room for the likes of Onana, who’s accumulated a catalogue of costly errors, to swoop in and steal the spot.\n\nSources close to senior Man Utd loanee believe he wants to controversially revive his career under next Old Trafford boss in 26/27\n\n‘Closing in on deal’: Ornstein drops unexpected transfer update over Man Utd target with medical now scheduled\n\nMichael Carrick has already told former teammate which Man Utd player he wants to ‘build around’, fans will be delighted",

    "description": null,
    "fullText": "In vision science, a saccade ( sə-KAHD; French: [sakad]; French for 'jerk') is a quick, simultaneous movement of both eyes between two or more phases of focal points in the same direction.[1] In contrast, in smooth-pursuit movements, the eyes move smoothly instead of in jumps.[2] Controlled cortically by the frontal eye fields (FEF), or subcortically by the superior colliculus, saccades serve as a mechanism for focal points, rapid eye movement, and the fast phase of optokinetic nystagmus.[1] The word appears to have been coined in the 1880s by the French ophthalmologist Émile Javal, who used a mirror on one side of a page to observe eye movement in silent reading and found that it involves a succession of discontinuous individual movements.[3] These movements quickly scan objects of attention and aid the brain in grasping a scene visually.[4]\n\nHumans and many organisms do not look at a scene in steadiness; instead, the eyes move around, locating interesting parts of the scene and building up a three-dimensional 'map' corresponding to the scene (as opposed to the graphical map of avians, which often relies upon detection of angular movement on the retina).[citation needed]\n\nWhen scanning immediate surroundings or reading, human eyes make saccadic movements and stop several times, moving very quickly between each stop. The speed of movement during each saccade cannot be controlled; the eyes move as fast as they are able.[5] One reason for the saccadic movement of the human eye is that the central part of the retina—known as the fovea—which provides the high-resolution portion of vision is very small in humans, only about 1–2 degrees of vision, but it plays a critical role in resolving objects.[6] Saccades allow the eyes to sense small parts of a scene with greater resolution and thereby allow the brain to assemble these parts into a coherent, continuous mental representation.[7]\n\nSaccades are one of the fastest movements produced by the human eye (blinks may reach even higher peak velocities). The peak angular speed of the eye during a saccade reaches up to 700°/s in humans for great saccades (25° of visual angle); in some monkeys, peak speed can reach 1000°/s.[8] Saccades to an unexpected stimulus normally take about 200 milliseconds (ms) to initiate, and then last from about 20–200 ms, depending on their amplitude (20–30 ms is typical in language reading). Under certain laboratory circumstances, the latency of, or reaction time to, saccade production can be cut nearly in half (express saccades). These saccades are generated by a neuronal mechanism that bypasses time-consuming circuits and activates the eye muscles more directly.[9][10] Specific pre-target oscillatory (alpha rhythms) and transient activities occurring in posterior-lateral parietal cortex and occipital cortex also characterize express saccades.[11]\n\nTo achieve such high speeds, there are specialized oculomotor burst neurons in the brainstem that wire into the ocular motor neuron. The burst neurons implement bang-bang control: they are either completely inhibited, or firing at its full rate of ~1000 Hz.[12] Since the motion of the eye is essentially a linear system, bang-bang control minimizes travel time.[13] After a saccade, a constant force is required to hold the position against elastic force, thus resulting in a pulse-step control.[14]\n\nThe amplitude of a saccade is the angular distance the eye travels during the movement. For amplitudes up to 15 or 20°, the velocity of a saccade linearly depends on the amplitude (the so-called saccadic main sequence,[15] a term borrowed from astrophysics; see Figure). For amplitudes larger than 20°, the peak velocity starts to plateau[15] (nonlinearly) toward the maximum velocity attainable by the eye at around 60°. For instance, a 10° amplitude is associated with a velocity of 300°/s, and 30° is associated with 500°/s.[16] Therefore, for larger amplitude ranges, the main sequence can best be modeled by an inverse power law function.[17]\n\nThe high peak velocities and the main sequence relationship can also be used to distinguish micro-/saccades from other eye movements (like ocular tremor, ocular drift, and smooth pursuit). Velocity-based algorithms are a common approach for saccade detection in eye tracking.[18][19][20] Although, depending on the demands on timing accuracy, acceleration-based methods are more precise.[21]\n\nSaccades may rotate the eyes in any direction to relocate gaze direction (the direction of sight that corresponds to the fovea), but normally saccades do not rotate the eyes torsionally. (Torsion is clockwise or counterclockwise rotation around the line of sight when the eye is at its central primary position; defined this way, Listing's law says that, when the head is motionless, torsion is kept at zero.)\n\nHead-fixed saccades can have amplitudes of up to 90° (from one edge of the oculomotor range to the other), but in normal conditions saccades are far smaller, and any shift of gaze larger than about 20° is accompanied by a head movement. During such gaze saccades, first, the eye produces a saccade to get gaze on target, whereas the head follows more slowly and the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) causes the eyes to roll back in the head to keep gaze on the target. Since the VOR can actually rotate the eyes around the line of sight, combined eye and head movements do not always obey Listing's law.[22]\n\nThe rotational inertia of the eye is negligible compared to the elastic and viscous force.\n\nSaccades can be categorized by intended goal in four ways:[23]\n\nAs referenced to above, it is also useful to categorize saccades by latency (time between go-signal and movement onset). In this case the categorization is binary: Either a given saccade is an express saccade or it is not. The latency cut-off is approximately ~200 ms; any longer than this is outside the express saccade range.[9][10]\n\nMicrosaccades are a related type of fixational eye movement that are small, jerk-like, involuntary eye movements, similar to miniature versions of voluntary saccades. They typically occur during visual fixation, not only in humans, but also in other animals with foveal vision, such as haplorhine primates in general and hawks.[24] Microsaccade amplitudes vary from 2 to 120 arcminutes.\n\nWhen exploring the visual environment with the gaze, humans make two to three fixations a second. Each fixation involves binocularly coordinated movements of the eyes to acquire the new target in three dimensions: horizontal and vertical, but also in-depth. In literature it has been shown how an upward or a vertical saccade is generally accompanied by a divergence of the eyes, while a downward saccade is accompanied by a convergence.[25] The amount of this intra-saccadic vergence has a strong functional significance for the effectiveness of binocular vision.[26] When making an upward saccade, the eyes diverged to be aligned with the most probable uncrossed disparity in that part of the visual field. On the other way around, when making a downward saccade, the eyes converged to enable alignment with crossed disparity in that part of the field. The phenomenon can be interpreted as an adaptation of rapid binocular eye movements to the statistics of the 3D environment, in order to minimize the need for corrective vergence movements at the end of saccades.\n\nSaccadic oscillations not fitting the normal function are a deviation from a healthy or normal condition. Nystagmus is characterized by the combination of 'slow phases', which usually take the eye off the point of regard, interspersed with saccade-like \"quick phases\" that serve to bring the eye back on target. Pathological slow phases may be due to either an imbalance in the vestibular system or damage to the brainstem \"neural integrator\" that normally holds the eyes in place.[citation needed] On the other hand, opsoclonus or ocular flutter are composed purely of fast-phase saccadic eye movements. Without the use of objective recording techniques, it may be very difficult to distinguish between these conditions.[medical citation needed]\n\nEye movement measurements are also used to investigate psychiatric disorders. For example, ADHD is characterized by an increase of antisaccade errors and an increase in delays for visually guided saccade.[23] Various pathological conditions also alter microsaccades and other fixational eye movements.[27][28]\n\nParoxysmal eye–head movements, termed aberrant gaze saccades, are an early symptom of GLUT1 deficiency syndrome in infancy.[29][non-primary source needed]\n\nWhen the brain is led to believe that the saccades it is generating are too large or too small (by an experimental manipulation in which a saccade-target steps backward or forward contingent on the eye movement made to acquire it), saccade amplitude gradually decreases (or increases), an adaptation (also termed gain adaptation) widely seen as a simple form of motor learning, possibly driven by an effort to correct visual error. This effect was first observed in humans with ocular muscle palsy.[30] In these cases, it was noticed that the patients would make hypometric (small) saccades with the affected eye, and that they were able to correct these errors over time. This led to the realization that visual or retinal error (the difference between the post-saccadic point of regard and the target position) played a role in the homeostatic regulation of saccade amplitude. Since then, much scientific research has been devoted to various experiments employing saccade adaptation.[31]\n\nSaccadic eye movement allows the mind to read quickly, but it comes with its disadvantages. It can cause the mind to skip over words because it does not see them as important to the sentence, and the mind completely leaves it from the sentence or it replaces it with the wrong word. This can be seen in \"Paris in the the Spring\". This is a common psychological test, where the mind will often skip the second \"the\", especially when there is a line break in between the two.\n\nWhen speaking, the mind plans what will be said before it is said. Sometimes the mind is not able to plan in advance and the speech is rushed out. This is why there are errors like mispronunciation, stuttering, and unplanned pauses. The same thing happens when reading. The mind does not always know what will come next. This is another reason that the second \"the\" can be missed.[32]\n\nIt is a common but false belief that during the saccade, no information is passed through the optic nerve to the brain. Whereas low spatial frequencies (the 'fuzzier' parts) are attenuated, higher spatial frequencies (an image's fine details) that would otherwise be blurred by the eye movement remain unaffected. This phenomenon, known as saccadic masking or saccadic suppression, is known to begin prior to saccadic eye movements in every primate species studied, implying neurological reasons for the effect rather than simply the image's motion blur.[33] This phenomenon leads to the so-called stopped-clock illusion, or chronostasis.\n\nA person may observe the saccadic masking effect by standing in front of a mirror and looking from one eye to the next (and vice versa). The subject will not experience any movement of the eyes or any evidence that the optic nerve has momentarily ceased transmitting. Through saccadic masking, the eye/brain system not only hides the eye movements from the individual but also hides the evidence that anything has been hidden. Of course, a second observer watching the experiment will see the subject's eyes moving back and forth. The function's main purpose is to prevent an otherwise significant smearing of the image.[16] (One can experience one’s eye saccade movements by using a cellphone's front-facing camera as a delayed mirror; if the screen is held a couple of inches away as the viewer looks from one eye to the other, the signal-processing delay allows them to see the end of their own saccade movement.)\n\nWhen a visual stimulus is seen before a saccade, subjects are still able to make another saccade back to that image, even if it is no longer visible. This shows that the brain is somehow able to take into account the intervening eye movement. It is thought that the brain does this by temporarily recording a copy of the command for the eye movement, and comparing this to the remembered image of the target. This is called spatial updating. Neurophysiologists, having recorded from cortical areas for saccades during spatial updating, have found that memory-related signals get remapped during each saccade.[34]\n\nIt is also thought that perceptual memory is updated during saccades so that information gathered across fixations can be compared and synthesized. However, the entire visual image is not updated during each saccade. Some scientists believe that this is the same as visual working memory, but as in spatial updating the eye movement has to be accounted for. The process of retaining information across a saccade is called trans-saccadic memory, and the process of integrating information from more than one fixation is called trans-saccadic integration.\n\nSaccades are a widespread phenomenon across animals with image-forming visual systems. They have been observed in animals across three phyla, including animals that do not have a fovea (most vertebrates do) and animals that cannot move their eyes independently of their head (such as insects).[35] Therefore, while saccades serve in humans and other primates to increase the effective visual resolution of a scene, there must be additional reasons for the behavior. The most frequently suggested of these reasons is to avoid blurring of the image, which would occur if the response time of a photoreceptor cell is longer than the time a given portion of the image is stimulating that photoreceptor as the image drifts across the eye.\n\nIn birds, saccadic eye movements serve a further function. The avian retina is highly developed. It is thicker than the mammalian retina, has a higher metabolic activity, and has less vasculature obstruction, for greater visual acuity.[36] Because of this, the retinal cells must obtain nutrients via diffusion through the choroid and from the vitreous humor.[37] The pecten is a specialised structure in the avian retina. It is a highly vascular structure that projects into the vitreous humor. Experiments show that, during saccadic eye oscillations (which occupy up to 12% of avian viewing time), the pecten oculi acts as an agitator, propelling perfusate (natural lubricants) toward the retina. Thus, in birds, saccadic eye movements appear to be important in retinal nutrition and cellular respiration.[38]",

    "description": "The company wants to plow more money into its wearable tech.",
    "fullText": "Meta is laying off more than 1,000 workers, signaling a partial retreat from the company’s much-derided metaverse ambitions.\n\nThe layoff, the Bay Area tech industry’s first big job cut of 2026, was announced Tuesday morning in an internal post from Meta’s chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth, according to a Bloomberg report that Meta spokesperson Tracy Clayton confirmed to SFGATE. The cuts won’t touch Facebook, Instagram or WhatsApp; they’re within Meta’s Reality Labs arm, an operation that’s poured investment into the “metaverse” idea and also sells the company’s virtual reality headsets and Ray-Ban glasses.\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\n“We said last month that we were shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward Wearables,” Clayton wrote in an emailed statement. “This is part of that effort, and we plan to reinvest the savings to support the growth of wearables this year.”\n\nAs of Tuesday at 9:15 a.m., the Menlo Park company had not filed a WARN document with California officials announcing the local scope of the layoffs.\n\nMeta’s pullback from its metaverse goals has been a long time coming. When Mark Zuckerberg changed his company’s name from Facebook in October 2021, he expounded on the idea of a virtual world where people could work, learn, play and shop together, calling it an “embodied internet where you’re in the experience, not just looking at it.”\n\nHe wrote, “Feeling truly present with another person is the ultimate dream of social technology.” His ambitions were, like the rhetoric, grand: “Our hope is that within the next decade, the metaverse will reach a billion people, host hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce, and support jobs for millions of creators and developers.”\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nBut hype around the idea of a metaverse — at one point, people were buying virtual land on other companies’ versions of the metaverse — quickly faded into derision. Meta was mocked for its legless virtual avatars, and failed to turn its Horizon Worlds metaverse product into a hit.\n\nRather than renewing the company, the ambition instead has served as a drag on Meta’s finances. In 2024, the company reported spending 21% of its costs on the Reality Labs segment, even as it lost more than $17.7 billion in the division. Quarter after quarter, the long-term bet has eaten into Meta’s vast social media ad profits. Bloomberg reported Tuesday that the division has turned a $71 billion loss since the start of 2021.\n\nZuckerberg’s choice to move that investment toward Meta’s wearables, rather than the metaverse, is a bet on products that Meta has been actually able to find large audiences for. The company’s Quest headsets are well-reviewed and far, far cheaper than Apple’s Vision Pro offering. Bloomberg reported that Meta is considering doubling its output of its new artificial intelligence-embedded glasses, thanks to high demand.\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nAs SFGATE reported, Zuckerberg is imagining a future where anyone not wearing high-tech frames will be at a “cognitive disadvantage.” Moving money from the metaverse toward wearables means he’s swapping one lofty ambition for another.\n\nWork at a Bay Area tech company and want to talk?

However, the O(n^3) computational cost of kernel matrix operations poses a major obstacle to applying GPs at scale. HiGP is a high-performance Python package designed to overcome these scalability limitations through advanced numerical linear algebra and hierarchical kernel representations. It integrates H^2 matrices to achieve near-linear complexity in both storage and computation for spatial datasets, supports on-the-fly kernel evaluation to avoid explicit storage in large-scale problems, and incorporates a robust Adaptive Factorized Nyström (AFN) preconditioner that accelerates convergence of iterative solvers across a broad range of kernel spectra. These computational kernels are implemented in C++ for maximum performance and exposed through Python interfaces, enabling seamless integration with modern machine learning workflows.",

    "description": "Scheme intended to verify someone’s right to work in the UK will be optional, government admitted in 13th U-turn since taking power",
    "fullText": "Sir Keir Starmer has abandoned plans for mandatory digital IDs for workers in the 13th significant U-turn of his ­premiership.\n\nThe prime minister had previously announced that they would be ­compulsory to verify the right to work, as part of a crackdown on migration.\n\nGovernment sources said on Tuesday night that this would instead be optional when the IDs were introduced in 2029. Workers would be given the choice of using other ­documents to ­verify their identity.\n\nThere had been concern that making the IDs mandatory would undermine public trust in the scheme and lead to a cabinet revolt. Starmer wants to ­refocus the case for IDs on making it easier for people to use services such as registering births, deaths and marriages, bank accounts, voting and booking GP appointments­.\n\nShortly before Labour’s conference in September, Starmer had put migration at the heart of the rationale for IDs, saying: “We need to know who is in our country.” He said then the scheme would stop illegal migrants from being able to “slip into the shadow economy”.\n\nHe pledged to make ID cards “mandatory for the right to work before the end of this Parliament”. “We need to know who is in our country,” he said, adding that digital IDs would prevent migrants from being able to come to the UK illegally and being able to “slip into the shadow economy”.\n\nBefore he announced his plans for digital IDs, nearly six in ten voters backed them, with one in four opposed, according to YouGov. Afterwards that dropped to just under four in ten in ­favour, with nearly half opposed.\n\nThere are mounting concerns about the cost and complexity of the scheme. The Office for Budget Responsibility has said it could cost as much as £1.8 billion over the next three years. The government has disputed that but refused to provide a figure of its own.\n\nA government source said: “Stepping back from mandatory use cases will ­deflate one of the main points of ­contention. We do not want to risk there being cases of some 65-year-old in a rural area being barred from ­working because he hasn’t downloaded this app.”\n\nAnother government source said that it had never been wise to try to sell the plan on right-to-work checks. “That does not impact normal people,” they said. “It always should have been about the convenience.”\n\nUnder the plans, anyone starting a job would have been required to “show” the digital ID, which would be checked against a central database of those ­entitled to work in the UK. While right-to-work checks will still be mandatory, they can now take place using other forms of documentation such as an electronic visa or passport. A consultation will explore what other checks could be used.\n\nA government spokesman said: “We ­remain committed to mandatory digital right-to-work checks. Currently [such] checks ­include a hodgepodge of paper-based systems with no record of checks ever taking place. This is open to fraud and abuse. We have always been clear that details on the digital ID scheme will be set out following a full public consultation which will launch shortly. Digital ID will make everyday life easier for people, ensuring public services are more personal, joined-up and effective, while also remaining inclusive.”\n\nGovernment sources also said that the changes would combat conspiracy theorists who say digital IDs are about state control of people’s lives.\n\nDarren Jones, the chief secretary to the prime minister who is responsible for the digital ID introduction, said: “I’m confident that this time next year, polling will be in a much better place on Digital ID than it is today.”\n\nLast week Starmer made Josh Simons, the MP and ex-head of the ­Labour Together think tank, the science and technology minister in charge of the scheme, ­reporting to Jones.\n\nStarmer has suffered cabinet criticism of the scheme amid fears that it would drive left-wing Labour voters to the Liberal Democrats and Greens. Ministers told The Times in October that the scheme was a “fantasy” that would do nothing to address the problem of illegal immigration. Another said it was “too expensive and complicated” and would end up recreating “what already exists, which is e-visas for migrants”.\n\nThe reversal follows 12 others from Labour. The party has backtracked on higher business rates for pubs; relaxed the inheritance tax raid on farmers; dropped plans for day-one protection from unfair dismissal; scrapped the two-child benefit cap; shelved plans to raise the main rate of income tax; dropped welfare reforms; agreed to a national inquiry­ on grooming gangs; increased national insurance; reinstated winter fuel payments for millions; dropped the claim that trans women are women; ­watered down plans to limit academy freedoms; and dropped a pledge to act on women who have lost pension cash.\n\nMike Wood, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, said: “While we welcome the scrapping of any mandatory identification, this is yet another humiliating U-turn from the government. Keir Starmer’s spinelessness is becoming a pattern, not an exception. What was sold as a tough measure to tackle illegal working is now set to become yet another costly, ill-thought-out experiment abandoned at the first sign of pressure from Labour’s back benches.”\n\nThe Liberal Democrats said: “No 10 must be bulk-ordering motion sickness tablets … to cope with all their U-turns.”",

    "description": "When Dylan Rothenberg moved to China, it felt like the Wild West: \"Everything felt negotiable — anything was possible if you were ambitious enough.\"",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Dylan Rothenberg, 32, the founder of Wu Mountain Tea. His words have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI realized in high school that my academic strength was learning foreign languages.\n\nMy dad did business in China, and his best friend was Chinese, so I've always had a connection to the country.\n\nWhen I was 15, I went to China to stay with a host family for six months as part of a US government-sponsored full-immersion program. It was in 2009, the golden era of US-China relations.\n\nAt 19, I decided to major in Chinese and economics at the University of Colorado, Boulder.\n\nI spent my junior year abroad in Beijing at Peking University. After six months, I started working as a translator.\n\nI sat in on negotiations with company founders, one of whom ran a tea company. He tasked me with buying tea and shipping it out to Geneva.\n\nI decided to take a temporary leave from school and moved to Guangzhou, home to the world's largest tea market.\n\nChina felt like the Wild West. At the time, nothing was black and white. Everything felt negotiable — anything was possible if you were ambitious enough.\n\nIn the market, I was haggling for goods and negotiating. It was pure adrenaline. I'd see the address of a manufacturer on the back of a packet of tea in the convenience store, then head to that address and start talking to the factory owner.\n\nWhen I was in a factory waiting for tea bags to be produced, a guy invited me to meet his professor, who specialized in tea at the South China Agricultural University. The professor told me to come back to Guangzhou after I graduated, and he'd teach me everything he knew about tea. He told me I'd be his first American tea graduate.\n\nI felt he was offering me a chance to be exceptional at one thing. After talking to my parents, I decided I wanted to focus on tea as a career after completing my bachelor's.\n\nI founded my company, Wu Mountain Tea, in 2015. Two years later, I started my master's degree in tea science and went on to earn a Ph.D. — both completed in China.\n\nHere, I've been able to form deeper personal connections. My best friends are Chinese, and I have close ties with lab colleagues and my gym bros.\n\nOne of my friends grew up in Wushan, the area of Guangzhou where I live, which means \"five mountains.\" I call him my \"sixth mountain.\"\n\nI see my professors two or three times a week. The relationship with teachers here is much closer than in the US. We drink together, have dinner at their homes, and discuss research in real time.\n\nI'll miss China's high-speed rail. It connects cities the size of New York or Chicago with metro-like efficiency. I travel often.\n\nGuangzhou to Shanghai — a distance of 1,500 kilometers, or 930 miles — takes seven hours, and I can arrive 20 minutes before departure and just scan my passport. Then I'm whipping along at 250 kilometers an hour. In the US, traveling equivalent distances is a logistical issue.\n\nThe shrimp dumpling, xiajiao, is my favorite morsel on earth. I can get a serving of roast duck in my campus dining hall for just 6 yuan, around 85 cents, and it's better than any duck dish in New York City's Chinatown.\n\nThe biggest struggle here is that strangers stare at me and point at me. I'm like an alien walking around. Even if they're not saying anything malicious about me, it's upsetting.\n\nIn New York State, where I'm from, you can't really make eye contact like that. It provokes confrontation. And here, I can't just lose my cool when someone is staring or laughing at me. For the last three years, I haven't left the house without a low-brimmed hat.\n\nAt the same time, I know I'm doing something unique. My YouTube channel, dedicated to tea, has more than 50,000 subscribers. If my business continues to grow, I could see myself staying in China — but for now, my plan is to return to the US.\n\nI grew up in Syracuse, the snowiest city in the US. I skied 120 days a year and was an alpine ski racer at a competitive level. I'm more comfortable on skis than on my own two feet.\n\nIn Guangzhou, there's no snow at all. I've been far away from what I love the most for the last 10 years. I plan to move back to Salt Lake City in a couple of years, so I can be closer to the mountains and my family.\n\nDo you have a story about living in Asia that you want to share?

    "description": "The Fed Chair sent a letter to the Senate Banking Committee in July that extensively responded to their inquiries on the Fed building renovation.",
    "fullText": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell sent a letter dated July 14, 2025, to key senators on the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, following his testimony before Congress about renovations to the central bank buildings.\n\nIn it, the Fed chair gave lawmakers a detailed and expansive response to inquiries about the renovations.\n\nPowell's letter to the Senate Banking Committee, obtained by Business Insider, was sent 10 days before giving President Donald Trump and other White House officials a tour of the renovation site on July 24, 2025.\n\nPowell announced via video message on January 11 that the Department of Justice served grand jury subpoenas to the Federal Reserve. He said the probe is into his June testimony about renovations at historic Fed office buildings, but warned that it was a pressure tactic over interest rates.\n\n\"This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions — or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.\"\n\nRep. Anna Paulina Luna accused Powell of misleading Congress and sent a criminal referral to the Justice Department, though it's unclear whether that prompted the DOJ investigation.\n\nThe letter to Sen. Tim Scott, chairman of the committee, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the ranking member, outlines the history of the Fed's Washington, DC, buildings, offers details about the repairs and working conditions, and provides information about the cost of the project's budget.\n\nThe letter was first reported by the Financial Times.\n\nPowell wrote that the Federal Reserve Board \"believes it is of the utmost importance to provide transparency for our decisions and to be accountable to the public through the Congress for our work.\"\n\nDuring Powell's testimony in June, Scott said the Fed's more than $2 billion renovation of its headquarters was excessive and likened it to the \"Palace of Versailles.\" Powell responded that many features Scott mentioned no longer exist, such as beehives, a VIP elevator, and water features, but added that the Marriner S. Eccles Building urgently needed safety upgrades and hadn't been meaningfully renovated before work began in 2022.\n\nThe White House and the Federal Reserve Board did not immediately respond to a request for comments.",

    "description": "The Andreessen Horowitz cofounder explained how the venture capital firm maintains a lean operation despite being a large firm.",
    "fullText": "Ben Horowitz is a big fan of tiny teams.\n\nOn an episode of the A16z podcast, the Andreessen Horowitz cofounder shared how his venture capital firm maintains a lean operation despite being one of the world's largest.\n\n\"An investing team shouldn't be too much bigger than a basketball team,\" he said, referring to advice he got from famed American investor David Swensen in 2009.\n\nHe added, \"A basketball team is five people who start, and the reason for that is the conversation around the investments really needs to be a conversation.\"\n\nHorowitz cofounded the Silicon Valley VC firm with Marc Andreessen in 2009. Before A16Z, he ran enterprise software company Opsware, which Hewlett-Packard acquired.\n\nA16z has backed marquee companies including Meta, Airbnb, GitHub, and Coinbase.\n\nThe VC said he always kept the basketball team size in mind but also knew that the firm had to expand to keep up with how \"software was eating the world,\" his signature phrase. The solution was to split the firm into different investment verticals.\n\nTo maintain good communication, staff attend other teams' meetings when investment themes overlap.\n\nThe firm also organizes a two to three-day offsite twice a year, \"with not much agenda.\"\n\nHorowitz said that people who join them from other firms say that A16Z has \"less politics\" than firms with 10 or 11 people because his firm has a culture where politicking is \"disincentivized.\"\n\nA16z might have been early to the tiny team trend, but it's catching on fast with VCs and startups across the world.\n\nStartups are actively seeking to stay small, with many having fewer than 10 people. Founders told Business Insider that AI and vibe coding tools have boosted their productivity, allowing them to get things done with far fewer people. Less politics and bureaucracy are also big pluses, they say.\n\n\"We're going to see 10-person companies with billion-dollar valuations pretty soon,\" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in February 2024. \"In my little group chat with my tech CEO friends, there's this betting pool for the first year there is a one-person billion-dollar company, which would've been unimaginable without AI. And now will happen.\"",

    "title": "A new American missile-mounted buggy has already scored over 20 kills against Russian Shaheds in Ukraine, crew says",
    "description": "Ukraine's air command for the central region published video of the Tempest firing what appear to be Hellfire Longbow missiles into the night sky.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's air defense forces said they've destroyed at least 21 Russian Shaheds with a new American light vehicle that fires guided missiles from its back.\n\nThe vehicle, called the Tempest, featured in a video posted on Tuesday by Ukraine's Air Command for the country's central region.\n\nThe footage showed at least three video clips of the system firing into the night sky, its missile arcing upward to track its target.\n\n\"As of now, our crew has destroyed 21 Shahed drones,\" said a Ukrainian soldier, identified by Air Command Central as an operator with the call-sign \"Shorty,\" in the video.\n\nThe four-wheeled, off-road buggy is equipped with a dual launcher that appears to be fitted with missiles that look like the AGM-114 Hellfire.\n\nThese American-made missiles typically require the assistance of a laser to track their targets and are often fired from aircraft such as the MQ-9 Reaper and the AH-64 Apache.\n\nThe Tempest, however, likely uses the Longbow variant, which instead uses radar to home in on targets in a fire-and-forget fashion. The Hellfire Longbow carries a 9-kilogram, or 20-pound, warhead.\n\nThe Ukrainian video did not specifically identify the type of missile used. The company that built the Tempest, V2X, is a Virginia-headquartered firm that's also pitching the vehicle to the US Army.\n\n\"This machine keeps the sky locked down,\" Shorty said in the air command video.\n\nHe added that his crew was previously deployed to Ukraine's eastern regions, saying that they destroyed \"all targets\" they attacked there.\n\nOther clips of the Tempest in action showed the buggy maneuvering in open fields, muddy terrain, and on a road.\n\nMobility is a key need for Ukraine's fight against Russian Shahed drones. Because these loitering munitions fly at speeds exceeding 100 mph, air defense crews only have a short time after detecting a target to arrive at an ideal firing location and launch.\n\nUkrainian troops once relied on trucks mounted with machine guns, but had to scramble for other options as Russia significantly increased the number of drones launched and started adapting to fly Shaheds at higher altitudes.\n\nThe sheer quantity of Shaheds that Ukraine often faces means that it needs lower-cost munitions to take them down.\n\nA congressional report from 2021 said that from 1998 to that year, the US spent roughly $10.9 billion, adjusted for inflation, on buying about 87,500 Hellfire missiles. That's about $123,000 per missile, though that figure would also include costs such as training, launchers, software, and support equipment.\n\nPrices can also vary for different variants of the missile, and the Longbow's radar guidance likely results in it being on the more expensive side.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian officials estimate that Russia can produce older Shaheds at roughly $35,000 each, though Moscow was believed to likely be making them at $70,000 apiece in 2025.\n\nIt's unclear what the cost ratio is between a Tempest launch and a Shahed or Gerbera, which are decoy drones that Russia deploys to give Ukrainians more targets to attack.\n\nWhen debuting the Tempest to the US Army in October 2025, V2X said the vehicle is made with commercial off-the-shelf components and can be offered as a stationary, trailer-mounted launcher.\n\nIt's also unclear how many Tempests are deployed in Ukraine. Only one vehicle appears onscreen at a time, and Ukraine is known to openly invite foreign weapons companies to test their products on the battlefield.\n\nNotably, the same clips of the Tempest firing, cropped to conceal the vehicle, appeared in an earlier New Year's montage published by Air Command Central, indicating that the vehicle has been in Ukraine since December.\n\nUkraine has increasingly relied on small first-person-view drones that are tweaked to fly extremely quickly and serve as interceptors. While these can cost as little as $2,000 each, they typically also require a human pilot and crew to successfully track, chase, and destroy a Shahed drone.",

    "fullText": "PHOENIX (AP) — Mark Brnovich, Arizona's top law enforcement officer when the state became the epicenter of efforts by President Donald Trump and his allies to find proof that the 2020 election was marred by fraud, has died. He was 59.\n\nBrnovich died after having a heart attack Monday, Katie Conner, a representative of the family, said Tuesday.\n\nColleagues and friends of Brnovich praised him for his work in public service that included stints as a judge, a prosecutor, lawyer and the director of the Arizona Department of Gaming. Former Republican Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey said Brnovich's passion for the law, justice and victims were hallmarks of his career.\n\n“For those of us blessed to call him a friend, his humor, positivity, and happy warrior spirit were infectious. May he rest in peace,” Ducey said on the social platform X.\n\nBrnovich, a Republican, was in his second term as attorney general in Arizona when his office investigated the 2020 election. Arizona was among the states Joe Biden won that year to deny Trump reelection to the presidency.\n\nBrnovich released an interim report in April 2022 that outlined his concerns with some election procedures but did not provide any proof of major issues despite six months of investigation.\n\nAt the time, Brnovich was seeking the Republican nomination for a U.S. Senate seat and facing fierce criticism from Trump, who claimed he wasn’t doing enough to prosecute election fraud. Brnovich wanted an endorsement from Trump but didn't get it.\n\nWhen current Attorney General Kris Mayes took office, she revealed that Brnovich suppressed findings from his investigators. Mayes said the records showed the 2020 election “was conducted fairly and accurately by election officials.”\n\nThe documents she released also showed Brnovich withheld a separate memo that systematically refuted election conspiracies that took root on the right, including allegations of dead or duplicate voters, pre-marked ballots flown in from Asia, election servers connected to the internet and even manipulation by satellites controlled by the Italian military.\n\nMayes posted on X that she was saddened to hear of Brnovich's sudden passing and said he dedicated many years to public service. She offered condolences to his wife Susan and their family.\n\nBrnovich lost the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate in 2021. In a video launching his campaign, Brnovich described himself as the son of immigrants who fled communism in Yugoslavia. He said he used his post as attorney general to take on “crony capitalists” and government overreach, while promoting religious liberty, border security and election integrity.\n\nIn April, Trump nominated Brnovich to be ambassador to Serbia but withdrew his nomination in October.",

    "title": "'Death by a thousand cuts': James Webb Space Telescope figures out how black hole murdered Pablo's Galaxy",
    "description": "\"It points to a slow starvation rather than a single dramatic death blow.\"",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nAstronomers have discovered that a young galaxy was gradually starved by its central supermassive black hole, in what was effectively a cosmic \"death by a thousand cuts.\"\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) studied this unfortunate galaxy, known as GS-10578 or by the slightly snappier nickname \"Pablo's Galaxy\" in honor of the first astronomer to study it in detail. The light from Pablo's Galaxy has taken around 11 billion years to reach us, meaning the JWST and ALMA allow astronomers to see it as it was just 3 billion years after the Big Bang. For such an early galaxy, it is exceptionally massive, containing as much mass as around 200 billion suns.\n\nThe majority of the stars in Pablo's Galaxy seem to have formed between 12.5 billion and 11.5 billion years ago. However, this galaxy seems to have stopped forming stars and has exhausted its supply of star-forming cold gas despite its relatively young age. As astronomers define the cessation of star formation and the transition into quiescence as the \"death\" of a galaxy, that means Pablo's Galaxy \"lived fast and died young.\"\n\nThe team behind this study first released results concerning Pablo's Galaxy back in Sept. 2024, using the JWST alone, finding that the supermassive black hole at its heart is pushing away huge amounts of gas at speeds as great as 2.2 million miles per hour (3.5 million km/h). That's fast enough to allow this star-forming matter to escape the gravitational influence of Pablo's Galaxy entirely.\n\nAdding ALMA, an array of 66 radio telescopes located in the Atacama Desert region of northern Chile, the researchers observed Pablo's Galaxy for a further seven hours searching for carbon monoxide, which they could use as a way to trace cold hydrogen gas, the stuff that forms stars. However, this search turned up empty-handed.\n\nBut this in itself was telling.\n\n\"What surprised us was how much you can learn by not seeing something,\" team member Jan Scholtz from Cambridge University in the UK said in a statement. \"Even with one of ALMA's deepest observations of this kind of galaxy, there was essentially no cold gas left. It points to a slow starvation rather than a single dramatic death blow.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a further 6.5 hours of observations with the JWST revealed that Pablo's Galaxy is losing about 60 suns' worth of mass in gas each year. At that rate, the galaxy's fuel for star formation could have been exhausted in a timescale of between 16 million and 220 million years. If that seems like an incredibly long period of time, consider that scientists normally estimate that it takes as long as a billion years to exhaust their fuel for star-formation in a galaxy such as this.\n\n\"The galaxy looks like a calm, rotating disc,\" team co-leader Francesco D'Eugenio of the Kavli Institute for Cosmology said. \"That tells us it didn't suffer a major, disruptive merger with another galaxy. Yet it stopped forming stars 400 million years ago, while the black hole is yet again active.\n\nThe team reconstructed the star formation history of Pablo's Galaxy, finding that fresh gas has been prevented by the black hole pushing gas outward from falling back into the galaxy. This prevents allowing the \"fuel tanks\" for star birth from being refilled. They also discovered that the supermassive black hole in this young galaxy didn't push away all of its gas at once, but has been experiencing repeated cycles of gas expulsion.\n\n\"So the current black hole activity and the outburst of gas we observed didn't cause the shutdown; instead, repeated episodes likely kept the fuel from coming back,\" D'Eugenio added.\n\nThe team's findings could help to explain why the JWST has been discovering lots of old-looking galaxies in the early universe.\n\n\"You don't need a single cataclysm to stop a galaxy forming stars, just keep the fresh fuel from coming in. Before Webb, these were unheard of,\" Scholtz said. \"Now we know they're more common than we thought — and this starvation effect may be why they live fast and die young.\"\n\nWith the effectiveness of the ALMA/JWST telescope tag-team established, astronomers hope that further observations of Pablo's Galaxy can reveal more about the mechanism used by the supermassive black hole to prematurely starve this galaxy to death.\n\nThe team's research was published on Tuesday (Nov. 25) in the journal Nature Astronomy.",

    "fullText": "Myrtle Beach drivers could soon see a change in the busy tourist district as City Council moves to end downtown flushing.\n\nAmid a flurry of legislative initiatives on Tuesday’s agenda for Myrtle Beach City Council’s first meeting of the year, a new motion would direct city manager Jonathan “Fox” Simons Jr. to end the Summer Emergency Vehicle Access Plan, or SEVAP, more commonly called flushing.\n\nThe plan – which city police said was intended to improve response times, increase visibility and allow officers to address concerns – seasonally reroutes part of the northbound lane Ocean Boulevard on weekend nights.\n\nIncoming Mayor Mark Kruea said the traffic diversion “visually sends the wrong message,” contributes to declining tourism and hurts local businesses.\n\n“The merchants reported a 40% decline in their revenues last year. If you’re trying to kill tourism, that’s the way to do it. We need to not take that action,” said Kruea.\n\nAlthough the motion would end scheduled flushing, it would still allow staff to utilize traffic control practices.\n\n“Police still have the ability to divert traffic as needed, but the automatic shut the boulevard down at 4:00 on Friday and Saturday serves no good purpose,” Kruea said.\n\nDespite support from businesses and the mayor, the motion isn’t without controversy. Councilman Mike Lowder shared support for SEVAP on behalf of consituents.\n\n“It is amazing how many residents, non-business owners, that I heard from,” said Lowder, “their displeasure, when they go down to the boulevard, they have to be turned off of the boulevard every Friday and Saturday night.”\n\nThe motion directs the manager to end SEVAP “effective immediately,” but a consultant is still finalizing an assessment of the plan. According to the motion language, a draft of the report will be ready in February.",

You probably wouldn’t have a job right now,” Trump told Dokoupil during the interview, conducted on the floor of a Ford plant in Detroit.\n\nWatch the full interview below.\n\nThen the president appeared to refer to David Ellison, who became CEO of Paramount last year after his Skydance bought the CBS parent company. Ellison’s father, Larry, is a longtime supporter of the president’s.\n\n“Your boss is an amazing guy,” Trump said. “Might be bust. Okay. Might be bust. I doubt it in his case, but you never know. Let me just tell you, you wouldn’t have this job. You wouldn’t have this job, certainly, whatever the hell they are paying you.”\n\nDokoupil later said that “I do think I’d have this job even if the other guy won.”\n\n“Yeah, but at a lesser salary,” Trump responded.\n\nThe Evening News ran the entirety of the interview, Dokoupil said, and it lasted about 15 minutes.\n\nDuring the conversation Trump talked about taking “very strong action” against Iran if the regime hangs protesters amid the unrest that has spread throughout the country. The president, though, was not specific about what that meant. At other points, Dokoupil let some of Trump’s claims go unchallenged, including that he “ended eight wars.” That has been challenged as hyperbole from the AP and other fact-checking sites.\n\nTrump also claimed that “there’s no inflation,” and later said that he had them “down to a level that they haven’t seen in about nine years.” In fact, consumer prices rose about 2.7% in December, according to the Department of Labor, and inflation was below 2% during points of Trump’s first term. The CBS Evening News anchor noted that “when I travel the country and I go all over the place and I talk to everyday Americans, they tell me they don’t feel it.”\n\n“I’ve only been here for 11 months, okay,” Trump responded, before saying that he “inherited a mess” and that “we have now the hottest country in the world.”\n\nThe most revelatory part of the interview may have been when Dokoupil questioned Trump about the shooting death of Renee Good by an ICE agent last week.\n\nDokoupil noted that he spoke to Good’s father, who is “a big supporter of yours.”\n\n“He’s heartbroken because his daughter is dead. He’s also heartbroken because your administration so quickly has come out and said she’s a domestic terrorist. What do you want to say to her father right now?”\n\nTrump answered, “Well, I want to say to the father that I love all of our people. They can be on the other side, as you say. He might be on my side.”\n\nDokoupil said, “He’s on your side.”\n\nTrump replied, “And I think that’s great … and I would bet you that she under normal circumstances was a very solid, wonderful person, but pretty tough.” He then went on to defend ICE and blast Joe Biden, before going back to the video of Good’s killing, and acknowledging that the videos are open to interpretation. Soon after the killing, the Department of Homeland Security quickly said that Good was trying to strike the ICE officer with her vehicle.\n\n“When you look at that tape, it can be viewed two ways, I guess,” Trump said. “But when you look at the way that was, that car was pulled away. There are a couple of versions of that tape that are very, very bad.”\n\n2026 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Streaming & Cable\n\nThe Movies That Have Made More Than $1 Billion At The Global Box Office\n\nThe 25 Highest-Grossing Animated Films Of All Time At The Global Box Office",

    "fullText": "“Bodybagz” is getting the biggest opportunity of his career in “Rain City.”\n\nUltimate Fighting Championship (UFC) CEO Dana White announced today that former Middleweight champion Israel Adesanya will headline UFC Seattle against surging contender Joe Pyfer on Sat., March 28, 2026, inside Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle, Washington.\n\nFor Adesanya (24-5), the bout represents a pivotal moment in his legendary career. The former champion is currently riding the longest losing streak of his time in the Octagon. In his most recent appearance, “The Last Stylebender” was knocked out by Nassourdine Imavov in the main event of UFC Saudi Arabia (watch highlights). Before that, he lost his title to Sean Strickland at UFC 293 and was later submitted by Dricus du Plessis at UFC 305 (watch highlights).\n\nDespite the recent skid, Adesanya remains one of the UFC’s most reliable headliners. UFC Seattle will mark his 12th consecutive main event appearance, and he currently sits at No. 6 in the Middleweight rankings.\n\nAcross the cage will be Pyfer (15-3), who finally gets his long-awaited step into elite company. After suffering his first UFC loss against Jack Hermansson in his first UFC main event, the Philadelphia knockout artist has rebounded in emphatic fashion.\n\nPyfer rattled off three straight victories, starting with a brutal knockout of Marc-Andre Barriault at UFC 303 (watch highlights), followed by a decision win over Kelvin Gastelum at UFC 316. Most recently, he showcased his evolving skill set by submitting Abus Magomedov at UFC 320 (watch highlights).\n\nA win over Adesanya would instantly vault Pyfer into the Middleweight Top 10.\n\nHere is what UFC Seattle currently looks like:\n\nCasey O’Neill vs. Gabriella Fernandes\n\nMarcin Tybura vs. Valter Walker\n\nNicolle Caliari vs. Carol Fiori\n\nMansur Abdul-Malik vs. Yousri Belgaroui",

    "description": "While the end of an era will hit hard for Ravens and Steelers fans who grew up with stability, the new-look Seahawks should be a beacon of hope.",
    "fullText": "John Harbaugh spent 18 years as head coach of the Baltimore Ravens. Mike Tomlin spent 19 years as head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Pete Carroll spent 19 total years as an NFL head coach, including 14 with the Seattle Seahawks. All three delivered a Super Bowl to their teams and cities during their long-tenured runs. But time ran out for all three as 2026 kicked off.\n\nHarbaugh, Tomlin and Carroll parted ways with their organizations within the first two weeks of the new year. Harbaugh and the Ravens \"mutually parted ways,\" Tomlin \"stepped down\" with the Steelers, while Carroll was outright fired by the Raiders. Carroll is likely headed to retirement, Tomlin is leaving football for at least a year, and while Harbaugh might get another job for next season, these three represent the old-style of football: culture over scheme, players over plays, and \"Jimmy's and Joe's over X's and O's.\"\n\nHarbaugh won his ring with the remnants of the early 2000 Ravens team, including Ray Lewis in his final year, with a big play-offense and an old-school defense. Carroll won the next year with an all-time great roster, but didn’t change the game with any innovative schemes. Five years earlier, it was Tomlin, winning with what was largely Bill Cowher's early 2000's Steelers team the distance with his own big-play offense and old-school defense. These coaches all stuck around for a decade or more after the fact. But perhaps that prevented their teams from evolving.\n\nOnce the Seahawks moved on from Carroll, they got to try a future with Mike Macdonald. Now they’re in as great shape as can be again. The Steelers and Ravens still have outdated strategies, and only keep competing for the playoffs because they’re in a division with the Cleveland Browns and Cincinnati Bengals who struggle as much as anyone to get, let alone, keep their act together.\n\nWhile the end of an era might hit hard for Ravens and Steelers fans who grew up with their identities of stability, they can look to the Seahawks as a beacon of hope. Seattle is showing them right now why moving into the next era of the NFL is better than staying in the past.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Seahawks Wire: NFL outgrew Seahawks' Carroll, Steelers' Tomlin, Ravens' Harbaugh eras",

The 52-year-old coach leaves Pittsburgh with a 193-114-2 regular-season record, two AFC championships, and one Super Bowl title, and he never had a losing season.\n\nReturning to Houston after their playoff matchup, Texans head coach DeMeco Ryans said he was \"shocked: to learn that Tomlin would be leaving the Steelers.\n\nDeMeco Ryans said he was 'shocked' by Mike Tomlin stepping down https://t.co/pi1zFWvi1w\n\n— Aaron Wilson (@AaronWilson_NFL) January 13, 2026\n\n\"Part of me is happy he was able to step away on his own terms.

    "fullText": "The NFL world was stunned on Tuesday morning when the news came out that Mike Tomlin was voluntarily stepping away as the head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers. This came less than 24 hours after the Steelers were blown out by the Houston Texans in the playoffs, marking the team's seventh-straight playoff loss.\n\nNow that we know the big news, let's talk about what might happen next.\n\nThere was a thought that Rodgers might run it back with the Steelers in 2026 but without Tomlin there, it's highly unlikely unless the Steelers bring in a coach with ties to Rodgers from Green Bay. So in other words, 2026 will be yet another new starting quarterback to kick off the season.\n\nWould anyone be shocked if the Steelers simply promoted offensive coordinator Arthur Smith to the head coach's position, let Teryl Austin leave and let Smith hire new coordinators? We hope this doesn't happen but it feels like a Steelers type of move.\n\nWe doubt Tomlin even considers coaching this season and fully expect him to find himself to a television studio for next season. This is great for the drama of seeing Tomlin coaching another team and the obvious comparisons that it would draw.\n\nWhen it was assumed that Tomlin was coming back, we fully believed there would be little to no changes to the roster. Now, with a new head coach coming in, all bets are off, especially at quarterback.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Steelers Wire: 4 things the Mike Tomlin news could mean for the Steelers",

In fact, they weren't done talking with the Miami Marlins for a trade either.\n\nAccording to Craig Mish of SportsGrid, the Yankees are sending four prospects to the Marlins for one starting pitcher. But that Marlins starter is not Sandy Alcantara, it's lefty Ryan Weathers.\n\n\"Miami Marlins are trading SP Ryan Weathers to the New York Yankees,\" Mish reports. \"Miami gets a big haul in return. 4 players in total.

In 2024, Weathers posted a 3.63 ERA in 16 starts with a 5-6 record and 80 strikeouts in 86.2 innings pitched.\n\nAdding Weathers to the rotation options is a nice pickup, as the 26-year-old is not just an option for 2026, but will be around through the 2028 season as well.\n\nMore: Yankees get $160 million contract update on Cody Bellinger amid stare-down\n\nBut the cost to land Weathers was far from cheap. According to MLB Pipeline, Jones is ranked 15th, Lewis is ranked 16th, Jasso is ranked 23rd, and Matheus is unranked.\n\nSending three top-30 prospects for any players is a noteworthy haul, and for this Yankees-Marlins deal, the return, including Jones and Lewis, is significant.\n\nLewis is 22 years old and was one of the prospects in trade talks between the Marlins and Yankees over Cabrera recently. Now, he's part of the package for Weathers.\n\nOverall, the Yankees are sending four prospects, including three inside the Yankees' top 25, all for Weathers, a 26-year-old lefty starter who's never started more than 16 games in a season before.\n\nMets know what contract they need to give to sign Cody Bellinger\n\nPhillies get bad news on Bo Bichette amid unexpected challenge from Alex Bregman Cubs deal\n\nMLB Hot Stove tracker: Live updates on news, rumors, signings and trades for 2025 free agency\n\nRed Sox linked to frustrating Alex Bregman replacements after Cubs deal\n\nDodgers predicted to poach $189M Silver Slugger, All-Star from Phillies to solve aging dilemma\n\nMets get Kyle Tucker news in free agency\n\nTeam USA World Baseball Classic roster: Bryce Harper, Tarik Skubal among stars on team for 2026 tournament",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Washington Commanders were hoping for big things in the 2025 NFL season.\n\nNothing went right, though, and they couldn't keep their momentum rolling from the campaign before.\n\nThey'll be looking to get a jolt for themselves in the offseason, and it may come from a trade.\n\nBleacher Report's Alex Ballentine has predicted in a new article that the Commanders could trade for Raiders pass rusher Maxx Crosby.\n\nHis projection has three picks going back from Washington to Vegas: 2026 first-round pick (No. 7 overall), 2026 fifth-round pick (No. 145 overall), 2027 first-round pick.\n\n\"History has a way of repeating itself. Back in 2018, the Raiders got a stockpile of draft picks from the Chicago Bears for a prime Khalil Mack,\" Ballentine writes. \"The Raiders might be in position to get another draft haul for a star edge-rusher.\"\n\nMIKE TOMLIN NEWS: What it means for Rodgers | TV future | Tomlin trade potential | Cignetti?\n\nIt'd be a steep price for the Commanders, but it could be worth it.\n\n\"The Commanders fit the bill,\" Ballentine writes. \"They have around $89.8 million in cap space and the potential to have a huge bounce-back season with a healthy Jayden Daniels next season. Washington's struggles this season gives them the advantage of a top-10 pick to offer to Vegas. Dan Quinn would get the marquee pass-rusher he needs to improve the Commanders defense and the Raiders would be able to potentially add a quarterback at No. 1 and a foundational defensive prospect at No. 7.\"\n\nThat big cap space is a key here.\n\nCrosby signed a three-year, $106 million contract extension before the 2025 NFL season. He'll be owed more than $40 million per year for the duration of his time conceptually in Washington.\n\nBut he'd be worth it. Crosby remains one of the best in the NFL. The Commanders could use him.\n\nPatriots, Drake Maye silence doubters with callback to Brady, Belichick\n\nA.J.

That propelled the contest to an all-time streaming record, with 31.61 million viewers.\n\nThe number represents a 43-percent bump over last year's Prime Video playoff game between the Steelers and the Ravens, which averaged 22.07 million viewers. It also broke the streaming record set by the Netflix Lions-Vikings game on Christmas Day, with 27.52 million.\n\nThe streaming high-water mark comes at a perfect time for the NFL. Amazon, as we understand it, will have to re-bid on the game next year. And the massive number for the latest game makes the property even more valuable going forward.\n\nWhich would explain the NFL's decision to handpick the best game of the wild-card slate for a streaming-only broadcast.\n\nAnd, yes, people still huff and puff about streaming only games. As long as the numbers blow the house down, the pivot to streaming will become more and more permanent.",

    "fullText": "Milos Raonic officially announced that he would be retiring from professional tennis.\n\nRaonic is a former Wimbledon finalist, but he had not competed since 2024 after struggling with injuries.\n\nAfter confirming that he would no longer be competing, Raonic received a message from Boris Becker on social media.\n\nRaonic was also messaged by his compatriot Felix Auger-Aliassime, and now John Isner has made a big claim about the Canadian’s career.\n\nIsner was one of many people to congratulate Raonic on his career after the announcement was made, and he continued to speak about the former world number four on the Nothing Major Podcast.\n\nWhen reflecting on his 16-year career, Isner called Raonic the greatest Canadian tennis player of all time, ahead of both Felix Auger-Aliassime and Denis Shapovalov.\n\n“Me personally, I thought Milos had a fantastic career, I mean everyone would obviously agree,” said Isner. “He had a fantastic career, got to three in the world and reached a Slam final.\n\n“Plagued by a lot of injuries, but in my mind he’s right now, maybe Felix or Denis can surpass him, he’s the best Canadian player of all time. To reach three in the world and get to a Slam final, I think we would all like to say congrats to Milos on a really fantastic career.”\n\nRaonic is the highest ranked Canadian singles player in history, and is the only man from his nation to reach a Grand Slam final as of yet.\n\nHowever, he is not the only Canadian singles player to reach a Grand Slam final, with both Bianca Andreescu and Leylah Fernandez also achieving this feat.\n\nFernandez lost to Emma Raducanu in the 2021 US Open final, while Andreescu went all the way to the title in New York in 2019.\n\nAlthough Raonic is not the only Canadian to reach a major final, he has won the same number of titles as both Andreescu and Fernandez combined.\n\nThis is likely to change though, as Fernandez is just 23 years old, while injury-plagued Andreescu is 25 years of age.",

    "description": "FC Bayern wants to keep up its high scoring ways.",
    "fullText": "If Bayern Munich can score eight goals against FC Köln like it did vs. VfL Wolfsburg, Vincent Kompamy will be a very happy man. Who wouldn’t?\n\nThe Belgian is not expecting that many goals, but would like to see his team continue onward with that style of play and mindset.\n\n“I hope this continues for a while. But what the boys showed on Sunday isn’t normal, we mustn’t forget that. The motivation is there, we want to see how far we can take this form. We know it’s not easy in Köln, we had a very tough first half in the cup there, it took 90 minutes to make the difference. But we feel we can always score goals,” said Kompany (as captured by @iMiaSanMia).\n\nAs always, the health of the squad was a big point of discussion at the head coach’s press conference. Interestingly. Kompany was finally asked about the status of Sacha Boey and gave a somewhat evasive response, but it does acknowledge a long-term sickness that was reportedly been going on since mid-December.\n\n“From a purely sporting perspective, he was unlucky; he was in a good phase – and then got sick at the wrong time. Now it’s just a matter of waiting until he’s healthy again,” Kompany said.\n\nBayern Munich sporting director Christoph Freund also jumped in to address Boey’s bizarre situation.\n\n“It was a bitter blow that he was ill for so long and still isn’t fit. We needed him during this phase; the most important thing is that he gets fit again. But there’s a lot of competition for that position,” Freund stated.\n\nWith Boey sick, the right-back position is a bit banged up because of the injury sustained by Josip Stanišić as well. In addition, Kompany acknowledged that Alphonso Davies is still sick as well.\n\n“Stani will no longer play in January. And even in February, he could be out for a few weeks. It depends on his recovery,” Kompany said. “(Davies is) ill, it’s winter so that can always happen. He didn’t really have a preparation, and now he’s sick, so it’s not ideal. I hope he can be back in training this week.”\n\nIllness seems to be an issue at the moment as Serge Gnabry was also felled last weekend.\n\n“Serge was ill on Sunday. It’s January, so a few players are not feeling well, it’s normal. Serge has shown a lot of quality for us this season. We shouldn’t forget that. He can play on the left, on the right, at the #10 position and always brings his quality. When he’s fit, Michael (Olise), Lucho (Díaz), Lenny (Karl) could always need a break,” Kompany said.\n\nFinally, Kompany talked over the potential returns for Joshua Kimmich and Jamal Musiala, who are both close, but not quite ready yet.\n\n“Everything is going well with Jamal, he’s taking part in almost everything and doing a lot of extra work. That’s a good sign – and he’ll be back soon. Maybe I’ll be able to share some news at the next press conference. Tomorrow’s game is still too early for Kimmich as well – he hasn’t trained with the team yet,” Kompany said.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nComment on articles, community posts",

    "description": "Arenado's modest on-field projection entering his age-35 season plus a no-trade clause meant that there were minimal expectations regarding the Cardinals' ability to reel in a return of significant value.",
    "fullText": "The St. Louis Cardinals continued their offseason of offloading on Tuesday, completing a deal with the Arizona Diamondbacks to send highly accomplished third baseman Nolan Arenado to the desert in exchange for right-hander Jack Martinez, Arizona’s eighth round pick last summer.\n\nAt first glance, seeing a possible future Hall of Famer swapped for a minor-league arm who has yet to even throw a professional pitch looks jarringly imbalanced, but this trade is the product of a multitude of factors hovering over the names involved. It is the end result of a saga dating back to last offseason in which the Cardinals sought to rid themselves of Arenado’s onerous contract while also affording the veteran the opportunity to play for a contending team elsewhere while St. Louis shifts its organizational focus to the future rather than going all out to chase a championship in the short term. And while Arenado’s name still carries significant weight league-wide as one of the most decorated position players of his generation, it’s impossible to ignore the degree to which his performance has declined in recent years, which heavily informs the nature of the deal.\n\nArenado was an all-around force early in his career with the Colorado Rockies, compiling gaudy numbers at the plate playing half his games at Coors Field while playing generational defense at third base, earning a Gold Glove in all eight years of his Denver tenure. Traded to St. Louis just two seasons into the eight-year, $260 million extension he signed with Colorado before the 2019 season, Arenado quickly proved his superstar stats weren’t merely the product of the hitter-friendly high-altitude in Colorado, delivering a spectacular 2022 season that saw him finish third in NL MVP voting. He continued to shine early on in his third season as a Cardinal in 2023, making his eighth career All-Star Game, but his production plummeted in the second half of that season, and has trended in the wrong direction ever since. His once otherworldly glove now merely rates as good, and his bat has sunk to slightly below league-average: Among 120 hitters with at least 1,000 plate appearances over the past two seasons, Arenado’s 95 wRC+ ranks 107th.\n\nMost crucially, Arenado held significant power within these negotiations, as the no-trade clause in his contract enabled him to green-light his destination once the Cardinals were able to find a willing trade partner. Arenado famously rejected an agreed-upon trade to the Astros during last offseason in hopes that a different suitor would emerge before the 2025 season, but that never happened, nor did a trade come to fruition at last year’s trade deadline while Arenado was in the midst of his worst season as a big leaguer. Nevertheless, Arenado and the Cardinals entered this offseason once again steadfast on finding a trade fit so both sides could move on, recognizing that moving the $41M owed to Arenado of the next two seasons would be difficult considering his recent performance.\n\n[Get more Diamondbacks news: Arizona team feed]\n\nAs such, Arenado’s modest on-field projection entering his age-35 season plus the fact that he still wielded a no-trade clause that enabled him to largely dictate his destination meant that there were minimal expectations regarding the Cardinals’ ability to reel in a return of significant value. That Martinez is the only player Arizona had to part with and that St. Louis is covering $31M of the $42M owed to Arenado over the next two seasons fully validates those low expectations.\n\nThe D-Backs are a team that has spent much of the winter involved \n\nFirst, it was the possibility that the Snakes would be willing to trade star second baseman Ketel Marte, a delicate gambit in theory intended to leverage their strong position player depth by dealing the ultra-valuable Marte in exchange for sorely-needed young pitching. Meanwhile, there was also consistent reporting that the D-backs were expressing interest in free agent third baseman Alex Bregman, perhaps as a creative avenue to replace Marte in the event they did trade him and his salary (and production) elsewhere. Ultimately, general manager Mike Hazen determined last week that Marte was no longer available in trade discussions. A few days later, Bregman agreed to a deal with the Chicago Cubs, rendering both intriguing scenarios irrelevant despite weeks of speculation.\n\nExactly how serious Arizona was in its pursuit of Bregman is unclear, but those rumors did suggest the club viewed third base as an area of need. That’s not an enormous surprise considering the Snakes had dealt away Eugenio Suarez at last year’s trade deadline, but it also seemed reasonable to look at Arizona’s depth chart and view this as a chance finally give the keys to 23-year-old Jordan Lawlar, the top infield prospect who has consistently raked in the minors but has yet prove himself in the majors, in part due to the series of injuries that has limited his availability. A sensible path for Arizona could have been to roll with Lawlar at third base and focus its offseason strategy and spending almost exclusively on adding much-needed pitching.\n\nEvidently, Arizona still viewed Arenado for what will only cost $11M over the next two seasons as a worthy upgrade. It’s more likely that says more the degree to which even this diminished version of Arenado could be a bargain at that price than Arizona’s confidence in Lawlar long-term, but it is an interesting roster-construction choice nonetheless. Just as we just saw with the Cubs signing Bregman despite the presence of a talented young infielder in Matt Shaw, contending teams are often willing to add veteran certainty even if it costs young, less-proven players playing time. That’s not to say Arenado should be expected to make remotely the same level of impact as Bregman in Chicago, but it’s also not hard to imagine Arizona liking the idea of adding a well-respected veteran like Arenado to a position player group that skews quite young. And if he can even provide some stability at third base more than any semblance of star power he still has left, that could play a meaningful role in boosting Arizona’s chances of staying afloat in what is expected to be another heated National League postseason race.\n\nSpeaking of the Snakes chasing a return to the postseason, If there is something still lacking on Arenado’s loaded résumé, it’s any semblance of memorable postseason success. Arenado has made just four trips to the postseason in his 13 years in the majors — two with Colorado and two with St. Louis — but has never advanced beyond the division series. He hasn’t exactly shined in those limited opportunities — he has just five hits in 33 career postseason at-bats — but in general, his lack of October experience obviously has far less to do with his own efforts and more about the teams he has been a part of.\n\nWith that in mind, as his career winds down, it’s understandable that Arenado would prioritize a club with ambitions of contending when surveying the landscape of possible trade destinations. Of course, it wasn’t entirely up to Arenado, as a team that what he was looking for still needed to step up and view Arenado as a worthwhile addition. Acknowledging that Arenado likely didn’t have a wealth of contending teams desperate for a player of his current caliber, Arizona is a pretty solid landing spot, all things considered.",

    "description": "During a \"Monday Night Football\" broadcast, Jason Kelce blasted his former Philadelphia Eagles teammates following their loss.",
    "fullText": "Jason Kelce is not pleased with the Philadelphia Eagles' exit from the 2025 NFL Playoffs, calling out his former NFL team for their \"mediocre\" and \"unacceptable\" performance.\n\nWhile Jason Kelce retired from the league in March 2024, the Super Bowl champion revealed he is still invested in the team's performance and is disappointed the current roster will not have a chance to compete for another title.\n\n\"[The Eagles] had their chances to win that game yesterday, and the players didn't make the plays!\"@JasonKelce acknowledges the coaching issues throughout the year, but holds the players accountable for losing against the 49ers 😳 pic.twitter.com/EiBdITdGXs\n\n— NFL on ESPN (@ESPNNFL) January 13, 2026\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles fans were hopeful their team would return to the Super Bowl in February 2026. However, they've been adjusting to their new reality after losing to Christian McCaffrey and the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday, January 11, in a 24-19 thriller.\n\nOn the Jan. 12 broadcast of ESPN's \"Monday Night Countdown,\" Jason addressed his former team's performance, admitting it wasn't \"the best\" before criticizing the athletes for failing to get the job done.\n\n\"They had the No. 1, highest-paid offense in the league and were mediocre across the board. That’s unacceptable,\" he said. \"They had their chances to win that game yesterday, and the players didn’t make the plays! Alright? That’s all I’m going to leave it at.\"\n\nSpeaking with reporters after the game, Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts addressed his team's shortcomings following their stellar 2024 record.\n\n\"I think winning is hard. Nothing about it is easy, especially when you’re trying to repeat,\" Hurts noted. \"Everything was clear for us and what we wanted to accomplish this year, and we came up short, and so you have no choice but to learn from it, especially if you have a great passion about it.\"\n\nHurts continued, taking ownership of the team's loss. \"It all starts with me and ends with me,\" he said.\n\nHurts was not alone in his thinking, as star running back Saquon Barkley weighed in on his team's loss and echoed the stance of Hurts and Jason.\n\nBarkley called the Eagles' downfall \"a common theme for us this year,\" adding that the squad of superstar athletes has done a poor job at \"playing complete football\" when it matters most.\n\n\"Sometimes, you get into this moment and [think] we’ll just figure this out. And it just caught up to us. It’s been the same thing all year,\" Barkley said.\n\nThe team's head coach, Nick Sirianni, also shared what he believes went wrong, calling the team's inability to come together as one their \"story.\"\n\n\"... good first half, didn’t do a good enough job coaching, didn’t do a good enough job executing in the second half, in that third quarter particularly,\" he said. \"Some penalties got us behind the sticks, and we had a hard time overcoming them.\"\n\nAccording to a report from The Blast, Jason also weighed in on his brother, Travis Kelce, and his possible retirement after the Kansas City Chiefs were eliminated from playoff contention on Sunday, Dec. 14.\n\nAfter entering the league in 2013 and securing three Super Bowl wins, Jason told his \"MNF\" co-hosts that he, too, had questions about his brother's future in the league.\n\n\"I'm curious too,\" Jason said. \"In my opinion, to nail that decision, you've got to step away from the game for a little bit.\"\n\nAnd while he waits, Jason gave Travis (who's also gearing up for his lavish wedding with pop star Taylor Swift) a bit of solid advice.\n\n\"Play these last three games, enjoy them with your teammates, enjoy that with your coaches,\" he said. \"The team's going to be different whether you come back or not next year. So, enjoy these last three games and then let it sink in. It'll come to you with time.\"\n\nThe retirement conversation likely hits close to home for Jason, who announced his departure from the league in March 2024.\n\nHis emotional, 40-minute speech sparked a range of reactions from fans and team leaders, including Eagles Chairman and CEO Jeffrey Lurie, who said it would be \"difficult\" to sum up Jason's importance to the organization.\n\n\"He gave everything he had to all of us for 13 years, and he did it in a way that was truly authentic. Jason was an incredible football player; a future Hall of Famer who would have been successful anywhere. But has there ever been a more perfect marriage between a player, a city, and a team?\"",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAssuming that Fernando Mendoza is the No. 1 overall NFL Draft pick by the Las Vegas Raiders, the New York Jets will have to cross their fingers.\n\nDante Moore isn't a lock to come out of Oregon and enter the draft. He'd be the only clear QB2 in a class that isn't as strong as once thought.\n\nIf Moore stays in school, the Jets may have to pursue a different route at the quarterback position.\n\nBleacher Report's Alex Ballentine suggests an outside the box option: Tua Tagovailoa.\n\nTagovailoa has multiple years remaining on what was originally a $212 million contract with the Miami Dolphins. It'd be a fascinating intra-division trade.\n\nBecause it'd be a salary dump, the Jets in this projected trade actually also receive a second-round pick and cash while only giving up a fifth-round pick.\n\n\"For all of Tua Tagovailoa's faults, he is 44-32 as a starter,\" Ballentine writes. \"Tagovailoa said he would be open to a fresh start after a season in which he ended on the bench. The only problem is that he's only one year into his four-year extension. The Jets are uniquely positioned to help the Dolphins out. They have $93.7 million in cap space, which is plenty to take on a significant portion of Tagovailoa's contract before cutting it in 2027 with little additional cost. That would help the Jets win now while adding to their draft pick stockpile and showing some creativity in navigating their rebuild under Glenn and general manager Darren Mougey.\"\n\nMIKE TOMLIN NEWS: What it means for Rodgers | TV future | Tomlin trade potential | Cignetti?\n\nIt would certainly be fascinating to see the Jets' leadership group put their futures in the hands of Tagovailoa.\n\nIt's hard to know if Tua could be good enough without a talented receiving corps, but maybe he needs the change of scenery more than anything else.\n\nThe narratives would be great if this happened, for sure.\n\nPatriots, Drake Maye silence doubters with callback to Brady, Belichick\n\nA.J.

Smith made quite the awkward on-air blunder while discussing the Houston Texans’ 30-6 playoff win Monday over the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nWhile recapping the matchup on ESPN’s “First Take” on Tuesday, the sports commentator misidentified the Texans’ star wide receiver, Christian Kirk, as the late right-wing political commentator Charlie Kirk.\n\nPolitics: Democrat Mary Peltola Launches Senate Bid In Alaska\n\n“We saw Charlie Kirk catch eight receptions for 144 yards,” Smith said before co-host Shae Peppler Cornette interjected to remind him: “Christian Kirk.”\n\nSmith quickly corrected himself. “I’m sorry, I apologize. Oh, my God, Christian Kirk.”\n\nThe verbal slip, which was shared on X by the sports media account Awful Announcing, has already racked up more than 11 million views.\n\nChristian Kirk and his team will play the New England Patriots on Sunday in an NFL divisional round playoff game. It appears that he has not publicly commented on the slip-up.\n\nCharlie Kirk, who co-founded the right-wing nonprofit Turning Point USA, built a massive social media following by holding debates on contentious cultural issues, where he often made incendiary, racist or sexist remarks. He was shot and killed while speaking with students at Utah Valley University on Sept. 10, 2025.\n\nAfter the killing, Smith condemned anyone celebrating Kirk’s death on his SiriusXM radio show.\n\nPolitics: Charlie Kirk Brought Hard-Right Politics To A New Generation\n\n“I don’t care what his political beliefs were. I don’t care what he felt. I care about the fact that a man was gunned down in front of two of his children, who are 5 years of age or less,” he said during the Sep. 11 episode.\n\nHe also praised the New York Yankees for honoring Kirk with a moment of silence ahead of a game against the Detroit Tigers.\n\n“Props to the New York Yankees organization last night for having a moment of silence,” Smith said. “We’re not supposed to condone stuff like this. We’re not supposed to say it’s OK.

A Jérémy Doku cross, nudged on at the near post by Bernardo Silva, gave the ex-Bournemouth star a simple finish in the 53rd minute of their Carabao Cup semi-final first leg against Newcastle United – and he came close to doubling his tally ten minutes later, though a lengthy VAR suggested that Erling Haaland had impeded Nick Pope’s vision in the buildup.\n\nRayan Cherki did eventually find that elusive second goal deep inside stoppage time at St James’ Park, although City were left ruing what could prove to be a costly disallowed goal if the Magpies get off to a good start in next month’s second leg at the Etihad.\n\n“The second goal should have counted by the way,” Semenyo told TV cameras as he trodded off the pitch on Tuesday night, and his sentiment was echoed by teammate Bernardo Silva, who suggested that the decision “looks ridiculous”.\n\nBut despite his grievances with the officials, Semenyo revealed that he is “enjoying every moment” of his time at Manchester City, hailing his teammates who “have helped me with my confidence and they’ve made me feel welcome.”\n\n“The whole environment here is perfect,” the forward explained.\n\nThings could yet get even better for Semenyo and his new teammates, as they turn their attention to Saturday’s trip across Manchester to face the Red Devils at Old Trafford. Pep Guardiola’s men will smell blood, relishing an opportunity to close the six-point gap to Arsenal by running riot against Manchester United in the first game of Michael Carrick’s interim spell as head coach.",

    "description": "The Yankees rotation for 2026 is looking strong, even with a few starters sidelined.",
    "fullText": "Yankees projected starting rotation for 2026 season after Ryan Weathers trade originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New York Yankees' rotation for the 2026 season isn't at its full strength at the start of the year. But, even with a few stars, like Gerrit Cole, Carlos Rodon, and Clarke Schmidt potentially sitting out for part of the 2026 season, the rotation is in a good place.\n\nThings got even better when they, according to Craig Mish of Sports Grid, traded four prospects to the Miami Marlins for starter Ryan Weathers.\n\nThe new lefty starter joins the rotation, making the Yankees' projected rotation for 2026 a strong one regardless of the injuries to Cole, Rodon, and Schmidt.\n\n1. Max Fried, LHP\n2. Cam Schlittler, RHP\n3. Will Warren, RHP\n4. Ryan Weathers, LHP\n5. Luis Gil, RHP\n\nThis projected rotation is likely what the Yankees begin the 2026 season with. There could be some change in the order, but this would allow the Yankees to break up their left-handers and right-handers, while putting Fried and Schlittler atop the rotation.\n\nIt's far from ideal, and isn't a World Series-caliber rotation. But, with the return of Cole and Rodon, along with Schmidt and the potential for other starters to emerge through Spring Training, the rotation is overall in a good spot.\n\nOnce Cole and Rodon return, the new-look rotation would be a whole lot better. Fried, Cole, and Schlittler would likely be the main trio, with Warren and Rodon rounding out the five-man rotation.\n\nThat would allow for Weathers, who's started at most 16 games in a season in his career, to take a back-seat as either a sixth man or potentially as a long reliever. The same could happen with Gil.\n\nMore: Yankees get $160 million contract update on Cody Bellinger amid stare-down\n\nOr, if the Yankees wanted to, thanks to the Weathers trade, once Rodon, Schmidt, and Cole are back, they could explore a trade or two with their depth starters this upcoming season.\n\nGil, Warren, or Schmidt might field decent trade interest, allowing the Yankees to upgrade at a position of need if one comes about during the regular season.\n\nWeathers will help keep the Yankees' rotation afloat to begin the year as one of the back-end arms, but once the three injured starters come back, and assuming there aren't any other injuries, then Weathers will be incredible insurance for the rotation.\n\nThe Yankees' projected rotation looks a lot better now that Weathers is on the team, as the five-man rotation to begin the season won't be in as bad a place if none of the three injured starters can go by Opening Day.\n\nMets know what contract they need to give to sign Cody Bellinger\n\nPhillies get bad news on Bo Bichette amid unexpected challenge from Alex Bregman Cubs deal\n\nMLB Hot Stove tracker: Live updates on news, rumors, signings and trades for 2025 free agency\n\nRed Sox linked to frustrating Alex Bregman replacements after Cubs deal\n\nDodgers predicted to poach $189M Silver Slugger, All-Star from Phillies to solve aging dilemma\n\nMets get Kyle Tucker news in free agency\n\nTeam USA World Baseball Classic roster: Bryce Harper, Tarik Skubal among stars on team for 2026 tournament",

    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks are back to their regular practice schedule in preparation for their third round against the San Francisco 49ers after a week off.\n\nTuesday’s injury report brought some rare good news for the Seahawks, with starting left tackle Charles Cross being a full participant. Cross’ return will be key as his replacement, tackle Josh Jones, was one of two players who did not practice with a knee injury he suffered in Week 18.\n\nAlongside Cross, rookie tight end Elijah Arroyo was a full participant and should be ready to make his return to the lineup against the 49ers. Safety Coby Bryant was also a full practice participant, which bodes well for his return to the field.\n\nThe report wasn’t all good news, though, as two key defensive pieces were limited on Tuesday. Defensive lineman Demarcus Lawrence was a limited participant with an Achilles injury, and an oblique injury limited what cornerback Tariq Woolen could do in practice. Both Lawrence and Woolen missed time this season and will be key in repeating the Seahawks’ Week 18 performance against the 49ers.\n\nThe Seahawks’ thin linebacker depth doesn’t seem to be improving either, as second-year linebacker Tyrice Knight did not practice. Here is the Seahawks’ injury report:\n\nSeahawks injury report for Tuesday: pic.twitter.com/cF0cDaDuWk\n\n— John Boyle (@johnpboyle) January 13, 2026\n\nThe 49ers only held a walkthrough on Tuesday, and as such, their practice report is only an estimation. Both wide receiver Ricky Pearsall and tackle Trent Williams were limited participants. Williams played in San Francisco’s Wild Card game, but was sorely missed by the 49ers in Week 18.\n\nHere is the 49ers’ full report:\n\n#49ers injury report.

    "fullText": "Antoine Semenyo has taken to life seamlessly at Manchester City and is already beginning to repay the £62.5m fee handed to Bournemouth to sign him.\n\nSemenyo scored and provided an assist in a memorable debut in the FA Cup third round on Saturday, though that 10-1 trouncing came against League One side Exeter City.\n\nHe then notched his second in as many games, scoring the opener inside the cauldron of St James' Park, helping City take control of their Carabao Cup semi-final against holders Newcastle.\n\nHe later put the ball in the net again, a goal eventually ruled out after a lengthy check from the video assistant referee, before City sealed the 2-0 win.\n\nThe 26-year-old adds a different dimension to City's attack, describing himself as \"powerful, quick and strong\", as well as \"clinical\" - that last attribute could prove to be a vital factor in this season's Premier League title race and City's hunt for silverware.\n\n\"I was in the right area to tap it in and we were victorious so I am happy,\" Semenyo said after the game. \"The whole environment here is perfect.\n\n\"Everyone is confident and wanting to achieve the best. I have come into that and they helped with my confidence and made me feel welcome.\n\n\"It has been a lot but I have enjoyed it so far. I am picking things up very quickly and enjoying it. I am playing with a smile on my face and enjoying every moment.\"\n\nSemenyo is set for another milestone on Saturday if he makes his Premier League debut at Old Trafford in the Manchester derby.\n\n'Game has gone' - bad night for VAR in semi-final\n\nCity's goalscoring burden has fallen mostly on the broad shoulders of star striker Erling Haaland this season, with the Norway international netting 39 goals in 34 games for club and country.\n\nBut the prolific frontman has hit a sticky patch of late, scoring just once in his past six games and last scoring from open play against West Ham on 20 December.\n\nPlaying as a wideman mostly from the right, Semenyo's proficiency in front of goal for Bournemouth has him on 10 Premier League goals so far this season, sitting third on the top-flight scoring charts behind new team-mate Haaland and Brentford's Igor Thiago.\n\nHaaland can not only expect a new avenue of goalscoring service – as showcased by Semenyo's assist against Exeter - but that weight of finding the net can now be shared with a player who scored a total of 32 goals for the Cherries.\n\nSemenyo adds a versatility to City by being able to play anywhere in the front three, enhancing the options available to manager Pep Guardiola.\n\nThe Ghanaian's speed, direct running and cool finishing has already been displayed in Manchester this season, with a brilliantly taken goal against United at Old Trafford in the chaotic 4-4 draw.\n\nGuardiola will be hoping his newest recruit can provide that sort of anarchy and unpredictability alongside the craft and vision of Phil Foden and the magic of Rayan Cherki in the final third.\n\nCity captain Bernardo Silva said: \"He looks not just a very good player but also a very good guy, which fits right in with the team.\n\n\"He is a fantastic guy who wants to help us. Hopefully he can keep going.\"\n\nThough losing another of their star players will no doubt sting, Bournemouth have brought in a sizeable transfer fee for another player they have sold since the end of last season.\n\nSemenyo's sale provides a huge profit on a player they signed for £10m from Championship side Bristol City only three years ago.\n\nThe south coast side have now brought in around £250m since the summer, but have been stripped of another prized asset having already lost Dean Huijsen, Illia Zabarnyi, Milos Kerkez and Dango Ouattara.\n\nBut it means boss Andoni Iraola will have cash to splash not only to replace Semenyo but also improve other areas of the squad.\n\nSemenyo had been heavily linked with a move to Manchester United, but it has proven to be a tumultuous couple of weeks for the Red Devils.\n\nNot only did they miss out on the forward to their bitter rivals, they also sacked head coach Ruben Amorim, with ex-midfielder Michael Carrick taking interim charge for the remainder of the season.\n\nCarrick's first game comes against City on Saturday and Semenyo could have graced the Old Trafford turf in a red shirt, but will instead head to the venue as an opposition player having already hurt the United backline this season.\n\nPremier League leaders Arsenal are aiming for a first title in over two decades and hold a six-point advantage at the summit but will be nervously looking over their shoulders knowing one of their nearest challengers have strengthened their side.\n\nCity are now overloaded with players on the right wing, meaning one of Oscar Bobb or Savinho may well leave the club this January or in the summer.\n\nNorwegian Bobb missed almost the entirety of last season with a leg fracture and is injured again – the 22-year-old has been heavily linked with a move to Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund.\n\nBrazilian Savinho is out of action too and has, at times, been unconvincing since his £31m move from Girona in 2024, struggling to nail down his place in the side, and Tottenham were in talks to sign him during the summer.\n\nGuardiola has said attacking players are judged by their output but the 21-year-old has managed to contribute only two goals and three assists in 23 appearances this season.\n\nLatest Manchester City news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man City - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Manchester City's 2-0 win over Newcastle in the first leg of the Carabao Cup semi-final was overshadowed by a contentious decision to disallow a goal from Antoine Semenyo in the second half.\n\nThe £65m January signing fired City ahead on 53 minutes and thought he had added a second 10 minutes later when he flicked Tijjani Reijnders' cross past Nick Pope.\n\nHowever, the forward was denied a third goal in two games for his new side after a five-and-a-half-minute VAR check adjudged Erling Haaland to have interfered with play from an offside position.\n\n\"The second goal should have stood,\" Semenyo said after the game.\n\nHaaland was jostling for position with Newcastle's Malick Thiaw when he was deemed to have obstructed the defender from stopping Semenyo's effort.\n\nReferee Chris Kavanagh watched the incident several times on the pitch-side monitor before announcing his decision to disallow the goal to the St James' Park crowd.\n\nSpeaking to Sky Sports after the game, Pep Guardiola said the disallowed goal will make his side \"stronger\".\n\nCaptain Bernardo Silva also voiced his frustration with the decision, particularly after the Premier League's Key Match Incidents Panel admitted Phil Foden was wrongfully denied a penalty in his side's Premier League defeat at the same venue earlier this season.\n\n\"It should have been 3-0 but we are quite used to this at the moment,\" said Silva.\n\n\"It is so frustrating because the last time we came here we also had a lot of decisions go against us.\"\n\nCity eventually scored a second deep into stoppage time when Rayan Cherki fired past Pope.\n\nSemenyo scores again - who are winners and losers of his arrival?\n\nMan City take control of semi-final with Newcastle\n\nVAR errors increase: Each of the 13 mistakes so far this season\n\nAfter a weekend where supporters enjoyed the FA Cup without VAR, this was the antithesis of the fans' football experience at St James' Park.\n\nIt took five minutes and 30 seconds from the moment Semenyo scored what he thought was Manchester City's second goal until referee Kavanagh made the VAR sign to disallow it.\n\nThe job of the VAR, Stuart Attwell, was made harder because the semi-automated offside technology failed, as it did when the two teams met in the Premier League in December. The players were too close together, so it meant Attwell had to revert to the old technology and draw lines.\n\nThe decision is technically correct in law, because Haaland was offside and in direct contact with a defender who could possibly have stopped the ball going into the goal.\n\nBut fans won't see it that way. They will see a perfectly legitimate goal with an offside offence which wouldn't have been noticed but for VAR.\n\nIf the decision had been quick, there would have been much more confidence. But the extended delay adds to the controversy and gives the impression the VAR was not certain. It would have been better if the VAR had left this alone.\n\nA decision being technically right is not necessarily what the game wants in this context.\n\nFormer Chelsea and Blackburn Rovers striker Chris Sutton agreed with Guardiola and Silva and said Kavanagh's verdict looked like a \"sheer guess\".\n\n\"I think the game has gone,\" added Sutton. \"Is Thiaw really going to stop that? The distance from Semenyo is a yard, a yard and a half. Thiaw is not going to react to that.\"\n\nEx-Liverpool and England midfielder Jamie Redknapp and Newcastle defender Dan Burn said it was the correct call to rule out Semenyo's effort, though both criticised the process.\n\n\"If they had given the goal there wouldn't be one person that looked at this and thought it shouldn't have been allowed,\" said Redknapp.\n\n\"But by the letter of the law, whether we like it or not, it is the right decision.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Burn, who missed the game through injury, added: \"I do think it is the right decision, I just don't like the subjective offside. It's either offside, or it's not.\n\n\"We don't want to see that, but by the letter of the law it should be disallowed.\"\n\nFormer Manchester City defender Micah Richards said: \"I understand the process but VAR wasn't brought in for this reason here.\n\n\"This is anti-goal which they said they weren't going to do, they said they weren't going to re-referee the game.\n\n\"This for me is re-refereeing the game. They are both going at it. It might be right, but I don't think we should be taking away goals for this. Why take five minutes?\"\n\nAman: Get rid of VAR! It's a joke, the officials are trying to find reasons to not award goals! There was no reason to rule out that second goal!\n\nMick: The worst VAR decision I have ever seen. There are re-refereeing the game.\n\nGeorge: As fans we didn't ask for VAR, it was pushed upon us and it's ruined the game. As soon as the ref goes to the screen we all know how it's going to pan out. It all just takes too long. Rubbish.\n\nFinn: So VAR has decided that Haaland made Pope jump forward and try to stop the shot. WOW. Laughable.\n\nIan: That was a terrible decision of offside, you couldn't tell if it was on or offside! If it's not obvious it should be a goal! Football is supposed to be about scoring goals!

    "fullText": "Michigan defensive back Elijah Dotson has committed to Missouri out of the NCAA transfer portal, per On3’s Hayes Fawcett. Dotson spent just one season with the Wolverines out of high school.\n\nDuring that season, Dotson played in 12 games at Michigan. He recorded 11 tackles, an interception and a pass defended, showing a knack for finding the ball and getting hands on it.\n\nPrior to enrolling at Michigan, Elijah Dotson was ranked as a top-100 prospect and a four-star recruit. He checked in at No. 94 nationally in the 2025 class, according to the Rivals Industry Rankings. He also checked in as the No. 12 cornerback in the class and the No. 2 overall player from the state of Michigan, hailing from Detroit (MI) Belleville High School.\n\nIn high school, Elijah Dotson was also a track star. He specialized in the 100- and 300-meter hurdles, ending as an All-State finisher five times in those events. He was also a four-time AAU Junior Olympian and a three-time New Balance All-American.\n\nHe posted personal bests in the 100-meter dash of 11.36 and in the 200-meter dash at 23.08. Quite strong times for a high school athlete.\n\nIn addition to Elijah Dotson, former UConn quarterback Nick Evers has committed to Missouri via the NCAA transfer portal, per On3’s Pete Nakos and Hayes Fawcett. He is the No. 116 QB in On3’s 2026 Transfer Portal Player Rankings.\n\nEvers made three appearances for UConn this past season. In his limited action, he completed 10-of-15 pass attempts for 105 yards and a touchdown, without throwing an interception.\n\nEvers transferred to UConn ahead of the 2024 campaign. He began that season as the team’s starter and made nine appearances. He finished the 2024 season with 918 passing yards and five touchdowns, while throwing five interceptions. He also recorded 245 yards and three scores in the ground game.\n\nPrior to joining UConn, Evers spent one season at Wisconsin. He didn’t see any action for the Badgers.\n\nEvers began his collegiate career at Oklahoma. In the 2022 season, Evers made one appearance and failed to complete his lone pass attempt.",

    "fullText": "It’s official: The Gainesville Red Elephants (Ga.) are being forced to vacate their GHSA Class 5A state semifinal victory over Rome from last month.\n\nAccording to a report by SCORE Atlanta Tuesday evening, the Red Elephants will be forced to vacate their 37-6 win over the Wolves in the 5A state semifinals last month due to use of an ineligible player.\n\nThe report states that photo evidence proved that Gainesville knowingly used an ineligible player during the victory over Rome en route to reaching the 5A state championship game. The Red Elephants ended up losing in the 5A state title game to Thomas County Central, 62-21.\n\nGainesville went through a tumultuous 2025 season, which was highlighted when the GHSA previously suspended 39 players after the conclusion of an investigation into a sideline-clearing brawl took place in the third quarter of a Class AAAAA second round playoff contest between the Gainesville and Brunswick.\n\nThe GHSA eventually allowed Gainesville to proceed through the Class 5A playoffs and permitted use of the 39 players, with the Red Elephants then going on to defeat Langston Hughes and Rome en route to the state championship game. That up and down season was the prelude to Gainesville’s news-filled off-season.\n\nThe Red Elephants have already seen former head coach Josh Niblett leave for a coaching position at Colorado University under Deion Sanders and Gainesville ended up hiring Santavious Bryant, the former lead man at Grayson.\n\nGainesville finished No. 7 in the final 2025 Georgia high school football rankings.\n\nGainesville High School, located in Gainesville, Georgia, is a respected public school known for its strong academics, competitive athletics, and vibrant extracurricular programs. Offering a range of AP and honors courses, the school prepares students for higher education and future careers. Gainesville’s athletic teams are highly successful, often achieving regional and state recognition. Emphasizing leadership, community involvement, and personal development, the school ensures students are well-rounded and ready for future challenges.\n\nFor Georgia high school football fans looking to keep up with scores around the nation, staying updated on the action is now easier than ever with the Rivals High School Scoreboard.

    "description": "The Yankees will send four position player prospects to Miami to add to their possible rotation.",
    "fullText": "It’s been 97 days since the Yankees were eliminated in Game 4 of the ALDS by the eventual pennant-winning Toronto Blue Jays. While the Yankees have done some minor housekeeping in the offseason, they have yet to add an external player who isn’t a waiver claim, on a minor-league deal, or dealing with Rule 5 shenanigans. That changed, however, on Tuesday night.\n\nPer the YES Network’s Jack Curry, the Yankees are acquiring left-handed pitcher Ryan Weathers from the Miami Marlins in exchange for four prospects. Marlins reporter Craig Mish was first on the four prospects being moved: outfielders Dillon Lewis and Brendan Jones, and infielders Dylan Jasso and Juan Matheus.\n\nIn exchange for Weathers, the Yankees parted with Dillon Lewis, Brendan Jones, Dylan Jasso and Juan Matheus. @CraigMish was on it with the minor leaguers involved in the deal.\n\n— JackCurryYES (@JackCurryYES) January 14, 2026\n\nWeathers is a former No. 7 overall pick by the Padres back in 2018 out of Loretto High School in Tennessee. After a solid full-season in A-ball in 2019 a rare playoff MLB debut during the COVID 2020 season, he made the Padres’ Opening Day roster in 2021. He had skipped the top three levels of the minor leagues and ended up throwing 94.2 innings across 30 appearances (18 starts), struggling to a 5.32 ERA. After realizing they rushed one of their top prospects, the Padres sent him back to Triple-A in 2022, where he spent nearly the entire season aside from one MLB spot start in May. Weathers struggled again in the majors in 2023 before being shipped to Miami for former Yankees first baseman Garrett Cooper at the 2023 Trade Deadline.\n\nEntering the 2024 season, Weathers’ luster had gone away with a 5.88 ERA in 156 innings in his career, but he found something in Miami. His fastball velocity steadily increased, going from 95.1 in 2023 to 96.8 in 2025, and his approach was refined to throw fewer four-seamers and more sinkers. It’s allowed him to throw 125 innings of sub-4 ERA ball with a 4.26 FIP, and an improved strikeout-to-walk ratio (15.2 K-BB%).\n\nThe hang-up since Weathers has been in Miami, however, is injuries. He missed three months with an index finger strain in 2024 and missed time with both a forearm and lat strain in 2025, limiting him to a total of 24 starts in two seasons.\n\nThere’s potential for Weathers to work out of the bullpen (like his right-handed father David, a 1996 World Series champion with the Yanks), but he currently figures to be part of a rotation that Brian Cashman has been scrambling to find upgrades to. With Max Fried, Cam Schlittler, Luis Gil, and Will Warren currently penciled into the Opening Day rotation with Gerrit Cole, Clarke Schmidt, and Carlos Rodón due to miss the start of the season, Weathers likely slides Ryan Yarbrough into the bullpen — assuming no other moves are made. What happens when the calvary returns will depend on how he fares, and who happens to be healthy at the time. The rotation insurance is key.\n\nWeathers will make $1.35 million in 2026 and has two further years of arbitration remaining, becoming a free agent after the 2028 campaign. He also has a minor-league option remaining, giving the Yankees valuable flexibility in case of a roster crunch.\n\nAs for the prospects heading to Miami, MLB Pipeline ranks Jones and Lewis as the Yankees’ No. 15 and No. 16 prospects, as well as Jasso at No. 23. Jones stole 51 bases across High-A and Double-A in 2025 while boasting a .359 OBP. Lewis went 20/20 at High-A Hudson Valley in 2025. Both were selected in the back-half of the team’s 2024 draft, and Baseball America was even a little higher on Lewis, ranking him eighth in the organization.\n\nJasso was an undrafted free agent out of New Mexico Junior College in 2023 and had been a consistent presence for Double-A Somerset for the past year and a half. He made BA’s Top 30, while Matheus was on the outside looking in; the latter hit .275 with 40 stolen bases in A-ball in 2025.\n\nWe’ll have more to come, but in the meantime, welcome a second Weathers to New York!",

The season doesn’t start for nearly eight months, and the excitement is already building.\n\nThe Wildcats continue to make additions in the transfer portal, and they have another quarterback in their room with Florida Atlantic transfer Carson Cruver.\n\nThe Austin (Texas) St. Michael’s Catholic Academy product spent three seasons at FAU playing for head coaches Tom Herman and Zach Kittley. Cruver appeared in two total games during his time in Boca Raton while attempting three career passes, so this is more of a depth addition than anything else.\n\nCruver will be a redshirt junior in 2026 with two years of eligibility remaining. He joins a quarterback room that includes Notre Dame’s Kenny Minchey and Marshall’s JacQai Long, as well as returnee Brennen Ward and incoming 4-star QB Matt Ponatoski.\n\nOn special teams, the Wildcats added Murray State punter Tom O’Hara.\n\nO’Hara is the third specialist addition for Stein and the Wildcats, joining South Florida kicker Adam Zouagui and Georgia State long-snapper Spencer Radnoti.\n\nO’Hara averaged 44.9 yards per punt in 2024, the third-best in the Missouri Valley. Last fall, he averaged 43.8 yards per punt.\n\nAdding O’Hara keeps the Australian pipeline going at punter for the Wildcats.

    "description": "Two-time UFC champ Adesanya has lost three straight bouts since his 2023 win over Alex Pereiera.",
    "fullText": "UFC is headed back to the Pacific Northwest with star power in tow.\n\nUFC CEO Dana White announced Tuesday that former two-time middleweight champion Israel Adesanya (24-5) will headline UFC Seattle in Climate Pledge Arena on March 28 against surging contender Joe Pyfer (15-3). The event also features a high-profile co-main event rematch, as former women's flyweight champion Alexa Grasso (16-5-1) meets Maycee Barber (15-2) for a second time.\n\nFor Adesanya, the booking represents another reset moment in a career defined by championship peaks. The longtime middleweight king reigned over the division for years with a precision-striking style that reshaped the weight class, compiling multiple title defenses and signature knockouts. However Adesanya has fallen on a downward slide of late, losing his past three bouts since he last held gold.\n\nPyfer has quickly emerged as one of the UFC’s most spotlighted middleweight prospects, pairing raw athleticism with finishing instincts and an increasingly confident cage presence. A main event against a global star like Adesanya fast-tracks him into the title conversation after three straight wins. If Pyfer can deliver the upset, it could instantly alter the middleweight championship picture.\n\nThe co-main event carries its own stakes and storyline. Grasso and Barber first met in 2021, with the matchup now resurfacing as both continue to push toward the championship at 125 pounds. Grasso’s technical polish and composure have made her one of the division’s most consistent performers, as seen in her win over Barber. Barber’s aggression and durability continue to fuel her rise, but she's refined her game since that loss and now rides a seven-fight win streak.\n\nThe current UFC Seattle fight lineup:\n\nMiddleweight: Israel Adesanya vs. Joe Pyfer\n\nWomen’s flyweight: Alexa Grasso vs. Maycee Barber\n\nHeavyweight: Valter Walker vs. Marcin Tybura\n\nWomen’s flyweight: Casey O’Neill vs. Gabriella Fernandes\n\nWomen’s strawweight: Nicolle Caliari vs. Caroline Foro\n\nMiddleweight: Mansur Abdul-Malik vs. Yousri Belgaroui\n\nFeatherweight: Zhu Kangjie vs. Márcio Barbosa",

    "fullText": "Pass rush was once again a hit-and-miss issue for the Cincinnati Bengals in 2025, ranking in the bottom third in sacks. Injuries to Trey Hendrickson and Shemar Stewart were the main cause, though the Bengals did get contributions from Myles Murphy and Joseph Ossai.\n\nExpect the Bengals to address the area again this offseason, in part because Hendrickson is set to become a free agent again and may end up walking.\n\nThat’s the direction the Bengals go in the latest mock draft from Pro Football Focus, going with David Bailey of Texas Tech with the 10th overall pick.\n\n\"The Bengals selected one of the best run-defending edge rushers in the first round of last year’s draft in Shemar Stewart and selected the best pass-rusher in this year’s class with Bailey here. He leads all FBS defenders in PFF grade (93.1), pass-rush grade (93.9), pressures (81) and sacks (15).\"\n\nBailey transferred to Texas Tech after a solid three years at Stanford. He burst into the national spotlight with 15 sacks, helping transform Texas Tech’s defense and vaulting them into a top-five team, a Big 12 championship and a spot in the College Football Playoffs.\n\nIf the Bengals go with Bailey, they could have the potential to sport one of the pass-rushing duos in the league with Bailey and Stewart, two young and developing talents on the edge.\n\nThe Bengals recorded just 35 sacks in 2025. A healthy Stewart and the upside of Bailey could strongly boost that number going forward.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Bengals Wire: Bengals land NFL draft's 'best pass-rusher' in new mock",

Now, a study of more than 34,000 people has edged us closer towards understanding the mixes of microbes that reliably signal we have low inflammation, good immunity and healthy cholesterol levels.\n\nYour gut microbiome can influence your immune system, rate of ageing and your risk of poor mental health.

But it is difficult to identify particular communities of interacting organisms that are implicated in a specific aspect of our health, because microbiomes vary so much from person to person.\n\n“There is a very intricate relationship between the food we eat, the composition of our gut microbiome and the effects the gut microbiome has on our health. The only way to try to map these connections is having large enough sample sizes,” says Nicola Segata at the University of Trento in Italy.\n\nTo create such a map, Segata and his colleagues have assessed a dataset from more than 34,500 people who took part in the PREDICT programme in the UK and US, run by microbiome testing firm Zoe, and validated the results against data from 25 other cohorts from Western countries.\n\nYour science-backed guide to the easy habits that will help you sleep well, stress less, eat smarter and age better.\n\nOf the thousands of species that reside in the human gut, the researchers focused on 661 bacterial species that were found in more than 20 per cent of the Zoe participants. They used this to determine the 50 bacteria most associated with markers of good health – assessed via markers such as body mass index and blood glucose levels – and the 50 most linked to poor health.\n\nThe 50 “good bug” species – 22 of which are new to science – seem to influence four key areas: cholesterol levels; inflammation and immune health; body fat distribution; and blood sugar control.\n\nThe participants who were deemed healthy, because they had no known medical conditions, had about 3.6 more of these species than people with a condition, while people at a healthy weight hosted about 5.2 more of them than those with obesity.\n\nThe researchers suggest that good or bad health outcomes may come about due to the vital role the gut microbiome plays in releasing chemicals involved in cholesterol transport, inflammation reduction, fat metabolism and insulin sensitivity.\n\nAs to the specific species that were present, most microbes in both the “good” and “bad” rankings belong to the Clostridia class. Within this class, species in the Lachnospiraceae family featured 40 times, with 13 seemingly having favourable effects and 27 unfavourable.\n\nWhy caring for your microbiome is crucial if you want to live to 100\n\nOur friendly – and not so friendly – gut bacteria lie at the core of healthy ageing. Research is now revealing what it takes to maintain a youthful microbiome\n\n“The study highlights bacterial groups that could be further investigated regarding their potential positive or negative impact [on] health conditions, such as high blood glucose levels or obesity,” says Ines Moura at the University of Leeds, UK.\n\nThe link between these microbes and diet was assessed via food questionnaires and data logged on the Zoe app, where users are advised to aim for at least 30 different plants a week and at least three portions a day of fermented foods, with an emphasis on fibre and not too many ultra-processed options.\n\nThe researchers found that most of the microbes either aligned with a generally healthy diet and better health, or with a worse diet and poorer health. But 65 of the 661 microbes didn’t fit in.\n\n“These 65 bacteria are a testament to the fact that the picture is still more complex than what we saw,” says Segata, who also works as a consultant for Zoe. “The effects may depend on the other microbes that are there, or the specific strain of the bacterium or the specific diet.”\n\nThis sorting of “good” versus “bad” bacteria has enabled the researchers to create a 0 to 1000 ranking scale for the overall health of someone’s gut microbiota, which is already used as part of Zoe’s gut health tests.\n\n“Think of a healthy gut microbiome as a community of chemical factories. We want large numbers of species, we want the good ones outnumbering the bad ones, and when you get that, then you’re producing really healthy chemicals, which have impacts across the body,” says team member Tim Spector at King’s College London, co-founder of Zoe.\n\nThe surprising relationship between your microbiome and sleeping well\n\nResearch is revealing the complex relationship between sleep and the gut microbiome, raising the prospect that eating better during the day might help you get a better night’s rest\n\nThis doesn’t mean the ideal healthy gut microbiome has been pinned down, though. “Defining a healthy microbiome is a difficult task, as the gut microbiome composition is impacted by diet, but it can also change with environmental factors, age and health conditions that require long-term medication,” says Moura.\n\n“We really need to think about our body and our microbiome as two complex systems that together make one even more complex system,” says Segata. “When you change one thing, everything is modified a bit as a consequence. Understanding what is cause and effect in many cases can be very intricate.”\n\nBigger studies are needed to tease out these links and cover more of the global population, says Segata. However, once we have established the baseline of your health and microbiome, it should become possible to recommend specific foods to tweak your gut bacteria, he says.\n\nNature DOI: 10.1038/s41586-025-09854-7\n\nReceive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox.

This comes after multiple Reddit users reported yesterday that Logi Options Plus — the app required to manage and configure the controls on Logitech accessories — had stopped working, preventing them from using customized scrolling features, button actions, and gestures.\n\nOne Reddit user said that the scroll directions and extra buttons on their Logitech mouse “were not working as I intended” and that the Logi Options Plus app became stuck in a boot loop upon opening it to identify the cause. Logitech has since acknowledged the situation and said that its G Hub app — a similar management software for gaming devices under the Logitech G brand — was also affected.\n\nAccording to Logitech’s support page, the problem was caused by “an expired certificate” required for the apps to run. Windows users were unaffected. The issues only impacted Mac users because macOS prevents certain applications from running if it doesn’t detect a valid Developer ID certificate, something that has affected other apps in the past.\n\nA patch has now been released to fix the issue, which needs to be manually installed “because the certificate also affected the in‑app updater.” Logitech says that the device settings, customizations, and profiles for impacted users will remain intact after installing the patch. This fix is available for devices running on macOS 26 Tahoe, macOS 15 Sequoia, macOS 14 Sonoma, and macOS 13 Ventura, with a fix for older versions of macOS coming “at a later time.”\n\n“We dropped the ball here. This is an inexcusable mistake,” Logitech spokesperson ATXsantucci said in response to user complaints on Reddit. “We’re extremely sorry for the inconvenience caused.”",

    "fullText": "Matthew Landry, a dietitian, studies how our diets can prevent heart attacks later in life.\n\nLandry recommends making simple food swaps to control cholesterol levels.\n\nOpt for olive oil over butter and chicken over red meat, he said.\n\nA nutrition researcher and dietitian who studies how simple habits can protect our hearts shared three simple food swaps.\n\nCardiovascular disease is the No. 1 cause of death in the US, but research has found that eating a Mediterranean-style diet and being physically active can help lower the risk. The American Heart Association's dietary guidelines recommend prioritizing fresh produce, whole grains, lean proteins such as fish, and limiting ultra-processed foods and refined sugar.\n\nThat may sound like a lot, but Matthew Landry told Business Insider that you don't necessarily need to overhaul your diet to improve your heart health.\n\nLandy, an assistant professor at the University of California, Irvine, suggested considering: \"how can we make simple swaps with our diet? How can we engage in more physical activity, and do very simple things that all add up to help prevent a heart attack later?\"\n\nHere are his three suggestions:\n\nLandry's first swap relates to the type of fat used for cooking. He suggests switching butter or lard for heart-healthy fats like olive oil or avocado oil.\n\n\"We're not necessarily changing the food, we're just changing how we're sometimes preparing it,\" he said.\n\nAnimal products and full-fat dairy products like beef tallow, butter, and cream contain saturated fat, which can drive up our LDL or \"bad cholesterol levels, Landry said. If a person has too much LDL cholesterol in their blood, it can form a sticky plaque in their arteries, putting them at greater risk of heart disease.\n\nWe need fat as part of a balanced diet, but unsaturated fats, found in foods such as avocados, fatty fish, nuts, and olive oil, don't raise our LDL cholesterol nearly as much as saturated fat, he said.\n\nThere's one finding that keeps cropping up in Landry's research: reducing red meat consumption lowers the risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nLandry worked on a 2023 study in which 22 pairs of identical twins were assigned either a vegan or an omnivorous diet for eight weeks. It was the focus of a Netflix documentary titled \"You Are What You Eat: A Twin Experiment.\"\n\nThis doesn't mean you have to cut out meat entirely, Landry said, but he recommended swapping red and processed meats, including beef, pork, and sausages, for leaner options like poultry, such as chicken and turkey, or fish, which are lower in saturated fat.\n\nIt's also a good idea to add plant-based protein sources to your diet. \"Eventually, I would love for folks to even move further than that and start consuming some plant-based proteins, some beans, lentils, tofu, tempeh. Those are great things for our heart as well,\" he said.\n\nFiber is great at keeping cholesterol levels \"nice and stable,\" Landry said, but most Americans don't eat enough. Ninety percent of women, and 97% of men, don't meet the recommended 30 grams of fiber a day, according to the 2020 to 2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The 2025 to 2030 guidelines recommend two to four servings of whole grains a day.\n\nWhole grains such as brown rice, quinoa, and whole-wheat bread are good sources of fiber and can easily replace their white counterparts, which tend to be low in fiber. One cup of brown rice, for example, contains 3.5 grams of fiber, while a cup of white rice contains 0.6 grams.\n\n\"We can still have bread, we can still have rice,\" Landry, said, \"but the whole grain version.\"",

    "fullText": "UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United States accused Russia on Monday of a “dangerous and inexplicable escalation” of its nearly four-year war in Ukraine at a time when the Trump administration is trying to advance negotiations toward peace.\n\nU.S. deputy ambassador to the United Nations Tammy Bruce singled out Russia’s launch of a nuclear-capable Oreshnik ballistic missile last week close to Ukraine’s border with Poland, a NATO ally.\n\nShe told an emergency meeting of the Security Council that the United States deplores “the staggering number of casualties” in the conflict and condemns Russia’s intensifying attacks on energy and other infrastructure.\n\nUkraine called for the meeting after last Thursday’s overnight Russian bombardment with hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles, including the powerful, new hypersonic Oreshnik missile, which Moscow used for only the second time in what was a clear warning to Kyiv’s NATO allies.\n\nThe large-scale attack came days after Ukraine and its allies reported major progress toward agreeing on how to defend the country from further Moscow aggression if a U.S.-led peace deal is struck.\n\nThe attack also coincided with a new chill in relations between Moscow and Washington after Russia condemned the U.S. seizure of an oil tanker in the North Atlantic. And it came as U.S. President Donald Trump signaled he is on board with a hard-hitting sanctions package meant to economically cripple Russia.\n\nMoscow has given no public signal it is willing to budge from its maximalist demands on Ukraine. And Russia's U.N. ambassador on Monday blamed the diplomatic impasse on Ukraine.\n\nEurope’s leaders condemned the attack using the Oreshnik as “escalatory and unacceptable,” and U.S. envoy Bruce was equally tough on Monday.\n\n“At a moment of tremendous potential, due only to President Trump’s unparalleled commitment to peace around the world, both sides should be seeking ways to de-escalate,” she said. “Yet Russia’s action risks expanding and intensifying the war.”\n\nBruce reminded Russia that nearly a year ago it voted in favor of a Security Council resolution calling for an end to the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n“It would be nice if Russia matched their words with deeds,” she said. “In the spirit of that resolution, Russia, Ukraine and Europe must pursue peace seriously and bring this nightmare to an end.”\n\nBut Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the Security Council that until Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy “comes to his senses and agrees to realistic conditions for negotiations, we will continue solving the problem by military means.”\n\n“He was warned long ago, with each passing day, each day which he squanders, the conditions for negotiations will only get worse for him,” Nebenzia said. “Similarly, each vile attack on Russian civilians will elicit a stiff response.”\n\nUkraine’s U.N. Ambassador Andriy Melnyk countered that Russia is more vulnerable now than at any time since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. Its economy is slowing and oil revenue is down.\n\n“Russia wants to sell to this council and the whole U.N. family the impression that it is invincible, but this is another illusion,” he told the council. “The carefully staged image of strength is nothing but smoke and mirrors, completely detached from reality.”",

    "fullText": "A Russian captain killed a crewman in an “entirely avoidable” collision with a US oil tanker in the North Sea, a court heard.\n\nCapt Vladimir Motin, 59, was on sole watch duty when his container ship collided into the Stena Immaculate, causing the death of Mark Angelo Pernia on March 10 last year.\n\nPernia had allegedly been working at the front of the Solong and died in the collision.\n\nOpening his Old Bailey trial on Tuesday, Tom Little KC, prosecuting, said the case involved the “entirely avoidable death” of the 38-year-old seaman Pernia.\n\nHe told jurors that the location of the Stena Immaculate would have been visible on the Solong’s radar display about 36 minutes before the vessels collided.\n\nMr Little said: “Despite an obvious collision course, the defendant did not deviate his vessel from its path and the impending catastrophe that lay ahead.\n\n“The defendant was responsible for navigating the ship, not only because he was the captain but because he was on sole watch duty at the time and ultimately, he did nothing, absolutely nothing, to avoid the collision.”\n\nMr Motin, from Primorsky, St Petersburg, is accused of manslaughter, Mr Little telling jurors that Pernia “would still be alive” if not for the Russian’s “grossly negligent” conduct.\n\nSolong, which was 130 metres long and weighed 7,852 gross tonnes, had departed Grangemouth in Scotland at 9.05pm on March 9 last year, bound for the port of Rotterdam.\n\nThe vessel, with a 14-strong crew, was carrying mainly alcoholic spirits and some hazardous substances, including empty but unclean sodium cyanide containers, the court was told.\n\nThe Stena Immaculate, with a crew of 23, was 183.2 metres long and was transporting more than 220,000 barrels of aviation fuel destined for the US military.\n\nIts engine was shut down on the evening of March 9. Restarting it would have taken about 30 to 45 minutes and about 35 minutes to manoeuvre away from an incoming ship, the court heard.\n\nThe two vessels crashed at about 9.47am on March 10, just over 12 hours after the Solong set off from Grangemouth.\n\nThe Solong had been travelling at just over 16 knots in the minutes before the collision and was going 15.2 knots on impact with no warning to the Stena Immaculate.\n\nPernia’s body has never been found.\n\nThe Solong was on a direct collision course for much longer than a matter of minutes, jurors were told.\n\nThe collision course was obvious when the tanker became visible to the naked eye and, before that, on computer equipment available to the defendant, Mr Little argued.\n\nMr Motin had a “constellation of information” telling him he needed to act but did the opposite and failed to avert the collision, the court heard.\n\nThere were a number of things the “highly trained” captain “could and should have done”, Mr Little said.\n\n“It is this gross breach of duty to the man he killed, and indeed to his own crew, that led inexorably to a death and to him being on trial before you at the Old Bailey,” the prosecutor said.\n\nMr Motin has denied manslaughter and the trial continues.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "CLEVELAND (WJW) – Flames, flashes of light, and loud explosions erupted in a Cleveland neighborhood Monday night, creating a light show that could be seen from miles away.\n\nEarly Tuesday morning, FOX 8’s Patty Harken reported the ramp from I-90 East to W. 44th Street remained closed in both directions as a result of the emergency scene that unfolded Monday evening.\n\nTraffic cameras Tuesday morning showed traffic backed up for miles.\n\nThe roads cleared around 9 a.m. Tuesday, and the exits are fully open to traffic now.\n\nThe closure and delays come after an explosion lit up the Cleveland skyline Monday evening at about 7 p.m.\n\nDietary supplement recalled over risk of ‘life-threatening events’\n\nSome residents said it sounded like the Fourth of July. Video captured by the Ohio Department of Transportation shows the flashes of light and explosions lasting about 40-seconds.\n\nFirefighters responded to the 4200 block of Fenwick Avenue for an occupied house fire. That’s when reports of a transformer explosion also came in, as well as multiple downed power lines across the road. Hundreds of Cleveland Public Power customers lost power.\n\nGun, ammo found at Strongsville High School\n\nCrews on scene Monday night said it became “critical emergency.”\n\nAs of 8:30 p.m., the house fire was under control, but Cleveland firefighters confirmed there was a gas fire at the house. Enbridge reportedly shut off the gas for the entire street.\n\nHow much daylight do we gain this month?\n\nFire companies at the scene had to go door-to-door to check electric meters for issues. Some of the electric meters were even blown off of houses, according to CDF.\n\nA FOX 8 viewer captured this video just before 7 p.m.\n\n“It sounded like fireworks down that direction, and in a matter of seconds, those fireworks got louder and louder and closer and closer,” one witness said. “Started to see the meters on some of the houses explode off. Wires started exploding, hitting my car.”\n\nAbout a thousand people lost electricity. No injuries were reported.",

    "description": "A \"nasty\" 15% sell-off could hit crowded trades this spring, says Tom Sosnoff.",
    "fullText": "The hottest AI trade on Wall Street has officially become \"boring.\"\n\n\"Nvidia would be a very boring idea ... because we all know the story,\" serial entrepreneur Tom Sosnoff told Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid.\n\nThe former founder of Thinkorswim and Tastytrade argued that despite Nvidia's technological dominance, the stock's story is too well-known and it may be priced for perfection.\n\nSosnoff isn't a tech skeptic. In fact, he's a fan of the product. He likened Nvidia's (NVDA) AI platforms to having a \"genius best friend\" with a 165 IQ available at all times.\n\nThe problem, he argued, is that Nvidia is now \"totally fully priced.\" When most analysts and retail traders are already on one side of the boat, that \"boring\" reality suggests there are very few surprise scenarios that can drive the price significantly higher from here.\n\n\"I look at Nvidia and I'm thinking to myself, how much more upside [is] in here and what kind of downside is there if this thing rolls over?\" Sosnoff said. \"It's not a function of ... Nvidia itself. It's just a function of price.\"\n\nThe warning comes at a time when market volatility is hovering at multi-year lows and stocks are sitting at record levels. In the past year, Nvidia's shares have risen roughly 40%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) recently closed at all-time highs this month.\n\nSosnoff isn't predicting a total market collapse, but he's bracing for a reality check. He anticipates a \"nasty sell-off\" in the range of 10% to 15% potentially hitting between March and May.\n\n\"The odds favor the downside in the market,\" said Sosnoff. He noted that while the equity market is partying, the bond market has remained eerily stagnant. If that volatility returns, the \"fully priced\" darlings like Nvidia are often the first to feel the gravity. Moreover, market fickleness could materialize when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's term ends in May.\n\nAnother provocative take is that Nvidia's reign as the world's most valuable company is under threat. When asked if the AI giant would still have its crown at the end of the year, Sosnoff was skeptical.\n\n\"I don't think it's going to be Nvidia,\" he said regarding the market cap race. Google (GOOG, GOOGL) has recently edged out Apple (AAPL) to become the second-most-valuable company in the world, and it's within striking distance of Nvidia as it surges past $4 trillion.",

    "description": "Winfrey appeared on 'Today' to promote her new book, 'Enough.'",
    "fullText": "Sheinelle Jones‘ second day as the fourth of Today‘s new cohost featured a very special guest.\n\nOprah Winfrey stopped by the NBC morning show to promote her new book, Enough: Your Health, Your Weight, and What It’s Like To Be Free, which she cowrote with endocrinologist and associate professor at the Yale School of Medicine Dr. Ania M. Jastreboff. While reflecting on her weight-loss journey, Winfrey shared some surprising side effects she’s experienced while taking a GLP-1 medication.\n\nJastreboff stated that the most common symptoms for people taking weight-loss medication include nausea, diarrhea, and constipation.\n\n“I never had nausea or diarrhea, but I did have the third one,” Winfrey stated. “I finally figured out, for me, what the right combination of magnesium and water is. I have to drink a lot of water. I have to have a gallon of water a day.”\n\nAccording to Winfrey, she has to finish drinking her gallon of water before 4 p.m., or else she will be up all night. While drinking lots of water makes Winfrey’s kidneys “very happy,” Jastreboff said there are other ways to “lessen nausea” while on weight-loss medication.\n\n“The most important way is working with your healthcare provider and going up very, very slowly. So, start slow, go slow. If you’re feeling nauseated, then don’t increase the dose,” she explained. “And there’s other things — not eating past the point of fullness, making sure you’re monitoring which foods could make you worse. All of these different things can lower the side effects.”\n\nWinfrey revealed that she gained 20 pounds last year after going off of her medication to test if she would retain her weight loss without the drug. “If you’re on blood pressure medication, you get your blood pressure to the level that your doctor says is healthy for you, you come off the medication, your blood pressure is gonna go up,” she stated. “The same thing is true for this. I know it ’cause I proved it.”\n\nEarlier in the episode, Winfrey said she has a newfound sense of freedom since starting a GLP-1 prescription. “The new freedom is understanding that all those years that I suffered and was on the tabloids every week and made fun of and was the butt of everybody’s jokes, and I thought it was because of my lack of willpower,” she told Jones and Jenna Bush Hager. “[I thought] ‘What is wrong with me that I can be successful in so many ways and I can’t conquer this thing?’ Now I know that it has nothing to do with willpower. It has everything to do with your biology.”\n\nWinfrey said she hopes her and Jastreboff’s new book will help change the conversation about obesity and weight loss. “Back in the day, when I first started The Oprah [Winfrey] Show, in ’86, ’87, we did our first show on alcoholism. And people in the audience were like, ‘Oh, just put the bottle down,'” she recalled. “People did not recognize — refused to recognize — that alcoholism is a disease. And so, now we’re saying the same thing about obesity.”\n\nWinfrey continued, “It’s a disease. It’s a chronic disease. You have to manage it. And even when you think you’ve gotten to your goal weight, it’s not the answer because what the medications do is manage the set point in your body.”\n\nToday With Jenna & Sheinelle, Weekdays, 10 a.m./9c, NBC\n\nRead the latest entertainment news on TV Insider.",

New Jersey City University’s campus in Jersey City would serve as a metropolitan campus for Kean University known as Kean Jersey City.\n\nThe governing boards at both institutions approved the merger last year and it would be among the largest-ever in New Jersey.\n\nKean University enrolls approximately 19,000 students, including students on its China satellite campus. New Jersey City University has about 5,500 students.\n\nThe planned merger is designed to help New Jersey City University stay open. The 99-year-old institution has grappled with financial problems for years.\n\nNew Jersey City University President Andrés Acebo said the merger would strengthen its role as “a vital pathway to public higher education in Hudson County and Jersey City, rooted in a deep commitment to access, opportunity, and community.”\n\nNew Jersey City University was assigned a monitor by the state in 2023 and directed to identify a potential university partner.

The FAA is still investigating, said public affairs specialist Steve Kulm.\n\nNo police report was filed, and it appears the incident was not a crash but more of a mechanical issue that forced an emergency landing, said Shelbie Boyd with the Tacoma Police Department. According to a public records request received Tuesday, the plane experienced a loss of oil pressure.\n\nAn eight-second video of the plane landing at the terminal was posted on Tacoma’s Reddit thread on Friday. The man who posted it, a retired longshoreman named Darin Moody, told The News Tribune over the phone Monday that the video was circulating in a group chat he was a part of. The video appears to be a recording of security footage the night of Jan. 7.\n\nBecause the situation involved a marine-cargo terminal, the Port of Tacoma referred The News Tribune was to the Northwest Seaport Alliance. Kate Nolan, with the Northwest Seaport Alliance, confirmed the Cessna plane made a successful emergency landing at TOTE after a mechanical issue. No cargo was impacted, she said.\n\nRepresentatives with the TOTE company could not be immediately reached for comment Monday, including to verify the security footage.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard Northwest District, which Tacoma police said might also be investigating the incident, did not have more information to share as of Monday evening.

He's saying if you already use toothpaste, toilet paper, canned soup, shampoo—things you're going to buy anyway—you might as well stock up when prices are lower. That's the ROI: buying stuff now to avoid paying more later. His version of \"investing\" isn't tied up in risk—it's about locked-in savings.\n\nLet's say you usually buy a four-pack of toilet paper for $6, but a bulk box of 30 rolls goes on sale for $20. That's about 67 cents a roll vs. $1.50 a roll. Over the year, you're not just wiping away inconvenience—you're saving real cash. Multiply that across your grocery staples and, like Cuban says, you're looking at a \"guaranteed\" ROI no stock or bond can promise.\n\nTrending: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\nAnd what about the rest of that $100,000? Don't expect a fancy ETF recommendation from Cuban.\n\n\"Whatever I have left I keep in the bank and let it earn nothing,\" he said in the interview.\n\nYes—\"let it earn nothing.\" Why? Because then it's ready. Cuban's not parking money in the bank out of laziness—he's waiting for the moment he can pounce. In his world, flexibility beats short-term yield.",

    "fullText": "Veteran trader and Thinkorswim founder Tom Sosnoff is a contrarian by nature.\n\nAnd where markets are currently trading has set off a few internal alarm bells.\n\n\"It's not that I think we're rolling over and crashing or anything like that, but I just think the odds favor the downside in the market,\" Sosnoff told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid.\n\nSosnoff added, \"I think there's a lot of stocks that are very fairly priced, and I know there's not a lot of other things to invest in and things like that. But I will just say that I think stocks are fully priced. And I think if you do get any kind of momentum to the downside, like we saw last April — and I expect to see something like that maybe in March or April or May this year — I think you're going to get a little nasty sell off, maybe 10% to 15%.\"\n\nTo Sosnoff's point, there isn't much margin for error being priced into markets.\n\nWall Street is expecting a big year for corporate earnings based on the view that mostly everything — from the economy to AI productivity to geopolitics — goes great. This optimism has powered the S&P 500 (^GSPC) beyond 7,000 for the first time, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) knocking on the door of 50,000.\n\nS&P 500 earnings are estimated to increase by double-digit percentages in each quarter of 2026, according to FactSet data. Earnings growth is expected to be the strongest in the fourth quarter at 18.1%. For the year, earnings are being modeled to grow 15%.\n\nMeanwhile, the bottom-up strategist's price target on the S&P 500 is a lofty 8,010 — up about 18% from current levels.\n\nIn turn, the forward price-to-earnings ratio (PE) for the S&P 500 is 22 times — well above the 10-year average of 18.7 times. Stocks are almost as richly valued as when they hit a peak in early January 2022. What followed was the start of a nine-month bear market — the benchmark index plunged about 19%.\n\nThe backdrop for stocks, however, is anything but perfect.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell revealed Sunday night that the Justice Department served the central bank with grand jury subpoenas, threatening a criminal indictment related to his testimony before the US Senate. At issue: reportedly, the central bank's renovation of its Washington, D.C., headquarters and whether Powell misled Congress about the project's depth.\n\nIn a video statement, Powell described the investigation as \"unprecedented\" and questioned the motivation for the move. The administration has been vocal in its desire for lower interest rates. Powell affirmed that he carried out his duties as Fed chair \"without political fear or favor.\"",

    "description": "Joe Rogan, in a blockbuster new podcast interview with Rand Paul, took a hard look at the tactics of ICE and added the shooting of Renee Good \"looked horrific.\"",
    "fullText": "Joe Rogan said he understands both sides of the debate on illegal immigration — including those who compare President Donald Trump’s ICE raids to Adolf Hitler’s Gestapo.\n\nRogan talked about the issue on his podcast with guest Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) on Tuesday. The podcast star said he gets why conservatives believe ICE raids are necessary to “take away some of the damage” done by illegal immigration.\n\nHe then said he also sees the “point of view” of anti-ICE protesters who argue “You don’t want militarized people in the streets just roaming around, snatching up people — many of which turn out to be U.S. citizens that just don’t have their papers on them. Are we really gonna be the Gestapo? ‘Where’s your papers?’ Is that what we’ve come to?”\n\nRogan made the remark while discussing the shooting of Renee Good in Minnesota last week. He said he read the agent who shot Good had been run over by a car last year — but that he still felt it was a “terrible tragedy” that shouldn’t have happened.\n\nI’m not that guy, I don’t know what he thought, and again this is a guy who had almost been run over. But this just looked horrific to me.\n\nWhen people say it’s justifiable because the car hit him, it seemed like she was kind of turning the car away.\n\nIt seemed like she was out of her f*cking mind to begin with. That lady seemed crazy.\n\nPaul told Rogan he did not want to get “too much into the specifics” of the incident because he did not want to “pass judgement like a jury would.” The senator said he believed ICE agents have a “very difficult job,” which Rogan agreed with, but mostly avoided talking about last week’s shooting.\n\nRogan said another “problem” with ICE raids is that they are making agents look like “villains” to many citizens.\n\n“People are now looking at them like murderous military people that are on the streets of our city,” Rogan said. “And they’re masked up, which is also a problem.”\n\nHe said if you get pulled over by a cop, you are allowed to ask for their name and badge number. But “If you get arrested by an ICE agent, you get no such right. They don’t have to tell you sh*t.”\n\nAt the same time, Rogan said he understands why ICE officers would want to be anonymous — because they fear anti-ICE protesters will wreck their lives.\n\nThe post ‘Are We Really Gonna Be the Gestapo?’ Joe Rogan Takes a Critical Look at ICE Raids — Says the Shooting Of Renee Good ‘Looked Horrific’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Barbies have offered broader representations of race, body type, and careers since the first doll debuted 66 years ago in 1959.\n\nGreta Gerwig's 2023 Oscar-winning \"Barbie\" movie also sparked a renaissance of the doll-inspired Barbiecore aesthetic, which included vibrant shades of pink, chunky heels, and kitschy accessories.\n\nBarbie dolls have exhibited strong staying power amid shifting toy trends, with net sales of $5.3 billion in 2024, according to Mattel.\n\nHere's a look at how Barbie dolls have evolved through the years.\n\nBarbie made her debut with a striped swimsuit, blonde ponytail, and red lipstick.

    "fullText": "Below, we look back at those we lost in 2026.\n\nAdams based the character in his beloved \"Dilbert\" comic strip on his coworkers at the telephone company he worked at in the 1980s. By the end of the decade, the character and his satirical office humor began appearing in comic strips.\n\nAt its peak, \"Dilbert\" was syndicated in over 2,000 newspapers. A cartoon series debuted in 1999 and ran for two seasons.\n\nAdams gained notoriety when he began writing blog posts praising Donald Trump during his 2016 presidential run. In 2023, \"Dilbert\" was pulled from newspapers across the US following racist comments made by Adams.\n\nAdams died on January 13 following a bout with metastatic prostate cancer.\n\nHungarian filmmaker Béla Tarr became a legend in the arthouse world for his unflinching work featuring several-minute-long takes.\n\nWith movies like \"Family Nest\" (1979) and \"The Turin Horse\" (2011), Tarr showcased his slow cinema style while focusing on marginalized characters living bleak lives. Tarr pushed the envelope with his style when he made \"Sátántangó\" in 1994, which had a run time of 450 minutes.\n\nHis work influenced several arthouse filmmakers, including Jim Jarmusch and Gus Van Sant's \"Death Trilogy\" (\"Gerry,\" \"Elephant,\" and \"Last Days\").\n\nTarr died on January 6 following a battle with a \"long and serious illness.\"\n\nWeir was one of the founding members of the Grateful Dead.\n\nThe singer-songwriter wrote and/or sang on songs like \"Sugar Magnolia,\" \"Playing in the Band,\" \"Truckin,'\" \"I Need a Miracle,\" and \"The Other One.\"\n\nAfter the Grateful Dead disbanded in 1995, Weir went on to form several other bands, including Kingfish, Bobby and the Midnites, RatDog, The Other Ones, and, alongside John Mayer, Dead & Company.\n\nIn the summer of 2025, Weir was diagnosed with cancer.",

In many cases, if you took that debt away, the business itself would actually be successful.\n\nThat's the argument FAT Brands CEO Andy Wiederhorn made on Jan. 12 at the ICR conference in Orlando.\n\n“We've been talking about restructuring this debt for 18 months to two years with our note holders,” Wiederhorn said, according to Nation's Restaurant News. “It has not been a very constructive negotiation…We’re looking at avenues to lower the debt and make it practical. I wish I could say that this would go quickly and get resolved, but it may take a couple of rounds.”\n\nThe company warned late last year that it might have to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after a key lender called its note. Wiederhorn's comments made it clear that the situation is more complicated than it appears on the surface.\n\nFAT Brands owns a number of big-name restaurant brands, including Johnny Rockets, Ponderosa Steakhouse, Great American Cookie, and the Twin Peaks restaurant concept, which is owned by a subsidiary.\n\nThe company shared the details of its latest financial problem in a 10-K filing with the SEC.\n\n“On November 25, 2025, FAT Brands Inc. received a notice of acceleration (the “Acceleration Notice”) from UMB Bank, National Association, as trustee under the Base Indenture, dated July 10, 2023 by and between the company’s subsidiary, FB Resid Holdings I, LLC FB Resid and UMB, relating to fixed rate secured notes issued by FB Resid. The Acceleration Notice stated that UMB, pursuant to Section 9.2 of the FB Resid Indenture, acting at the direction of the Controlling Class Representative under the FB Resid Indenture, accelerates and declares the outstanding principal amount of the FB Resid Notes to be immediately due and payable,” the company wrote.\n\nIn practical terms, the filing said that UMB delivered to Fat Brands a “Notice of Event of Default” with respect to the FB Resid Indenture, stating that an “Event of Default had occurred pursuant to Section 9.2 of the FB Resid Indenture. The aggregate principal amount outstanding under the FB Resid Notes is $158.9 million, or $110.0 million net of FB Resid Note,” it shared.\n\nSimilar notices were sent to four other subsidiaries of FAT Brands.\n\nFAT Brands has a complicated financial structure.\n\n\"While a trustee has declared FAT Brands’ $1.26 billion in debt immediately due, Wiederhorn stated on Tuesday that the debt is not guaranteed by the parent company as a whole. Instead, the total liability is spread across five securitization trusts, involves multiple layers of investors, and is tied to individual brands,\" NRN reported.",

    "description": "Dell has existed for 42 years, but the coming changes are the biggest transformation in company history, according to COO Jeff Clarke.",
    "fullText": "If you work at Dell, get ready for big changes in 2026.\n\nThe company is planning to roll out standardized processes across its operations and launch a single enterprise platform on May 3, Jeff Clarke, Dell's chief operating officer and vice chairman, said in a memo sent to the workforce on Tuesday, and seen by Business Insider.\n\nIn the memo, Clarke said the changes constitute the \"biggest transformation in company history.\"\n\nThe modernization push, which the company has called One Dell Way, will \"connect our data, break down silos, streamline our software applications and give us the foundation to work as one connected company,\" said Clarke.\n\nIt will replace Dell's existing sprawl of applications, servers, and databases, and deliver \"seamless data flow, fewer repetitive tasks, faster decision-making and more time for work that drives real impact,\" Clarke said.\n\nThe vice chairman, who has recently taken a more active role in Dell's day-to-day operations, said that the changes are a key enabler of Dell's modernization.\n\nFor years, the company has built multiple variations of tools used for fundamental processes, such as developing and selling, Clarke said in the memo.\n\n\"That won't cut it in an AI-driven world. We need one way —simplified, standardized, and automated — so we can be more competitive and serve our customers better,\" Clarke said.\n\nSimplifying the underlying infrastructure is a crucial part of unlocking AI's future potential: no matter how much companies spend on flashy AI tools, they won't deliver speed or scale if the data behind them remains fragmented.\n\nOne Dell Way is \"foundational to our success in an AI-driven world,\" Clarke said.\n\nA company spokesperson told Business Insider that \"One Dell Way is a transformation initiative designed to simplify processes, standardize systems, and use automation to create a more connected and efficient organization.\"\n\nRather than a gradual transition, the new operating system will kick in on a single crossover date, May 3, for Dell's PC business — known as the CSG division — as well as for finance, supply chain, marketing, sales, revenue operations, services, and HR operations, according to Clarke's memo.\n\nDell's ISG division, which handles its cloud offering, data servers, and other AI infrastructure, will follow in August, Clarke said.\n\nThe vice chairman told employees to \"be ready\" for the change.\n\n\"Training is critical,\" and should be a priority once training opens on February 3, Clarke said.\n\nBusiness Insider previously reported that Dell has been running a secretive, multi-year internal project, codenamed \"Maverick,\" for which staff had signed NDAs to work on. It was initially scheduled to launch for parts of the company in February 2026, but was pushed back to May.\n\nDell's current modernization drive comes 42 years after Michael Dell founded the company as a freshman at the University of Texas.\n\nDell has since expanded into AI and cloud infrastructure, gone private, and then returned to public markets, and pulled off the second-largest tech merger ever with its $67 billion purchase of EMC in 2016 — but, as Clarke said in the memo, the coming changes are Dell's biggest shake-up yet.\n\nRead Clarke's full memo to Dell employees here:\n\nOur industry is moving faster than ever, and we've spent the past two years modernizing how Dell works so we can move even faster—simplifying and standardizing processes, eliminating inefficiencies and improving our tools and applications. That's <One Dell Way>.\n\nNow we're taking the next major step in this journey: rolling out standardized processes and an enterprise platform that will connect our data, break down silos, streamline our software applications and give us the foundation to work as one connected company.\n\nWe'll begin operating in this new way on May 3, starting with CSG, Finance, Supply Chain, Marketing, Sales, RevOps, Services and HR operations. ISG follows in August.\n\nFor years, our strong functional orientation meant we built many variations of fundamental processes—multiple ways to develop, multiple ways to market, multiple ways to sell, multiple ways to service.\n\nThat won't cut it in an AI-driven world. We need one way—simplified, standardized and automated—so we can be more competitive and serve our customers better.\n\nThis requires a mindset shift, from thinking and operating function-first to company-first. In some cases, that may mean we may make a choice that isn't optimal for a particular function, but it speeds up decision-making or improves quality for the company as a whole. That's the trade-off, and it's the right one. We're optimizing for Dell, not for individual functions.\n\nStandardized processes and an enterprise platform mean no more workarounds, no holding onto old ways of working. Instead, we get seamless data flow, fewer repetitive tasks, faster decision-making and more time for work that drives real impact.\n\nThis is a comprehensive change, not a gradual transition. Once we start operating in the new way on May 3, we won't go back.\n\nThe degree of change will vary by team and role. Some of you will experience significant shifts in how you work day-to-day. For others, the changes will be minimal. But all of us need to understand what's happening and support each other through it.\n\nIf your work spans both CSG and ISG, you'll navigate the new processes and applications for CSG, and legacy systems for ISG until August. You'll learn \n\nLearning new systems and new ways of working isn't easy, especially when you're already moving fast. Here's my ask of you:\n\nTraining is critical. You can't operate in the new system without it, no exceptions. Training opens February 3, and you'll get an email that day with your personalized information. Please make it a priority.\n\nThis is the biggest transformation in company history. I know there will be challenges, and that's OK—we're here to support you and work through this together. Your leader will keep you updated as we move through training and launch.\n\nThis is foundational to our success in an AI-driven world, and One Dell Way is how we get there—working as one company, with one set of processes, focused on what matters most.\n\nLet's lean in, learn as we go and build a better company together.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Steven Bartlett, host of 'The Diary of a CEO' podcast, uses a 'Culture Test' that emphasizes character and values in hiring.",
    "fullText": "\"The Diary of a CEO\" host and entrepreneur Steven Bartlett swears by his scenario-based \"Culture Test\" in hiring, and says there's one question he loves, but that's rarely answered correctly.\n\nSpeaking on the \"Hot Smart Rich\" podcast, Bartlett said he uses a 35-question test rather than asking about academic grades to determine how people will act in a given situation and identify high-performing employees.\n\nThe question he loves goes like this: There's an event that's six weeks away, and an important supplier said they won't be able to get you the things you need in time. The options are: scale back the event, push back the date, or — the answer Bartlett is looking for — ask why it takes six weeks.\n\n\"It's so crazy, because about 7% of people click that button, but that is so clearly the right thing to do,\" he said.\n\nBartlett said the concept came up in his own company when an employee said he couldn't provide the animation for \"DOAC\" by Bartlett's deadline. When the employee was asked why, he cited his aging laptop.\n\n\"$2,000 fixed the problem that's now going to save me 60% of my time for years,\" Bartlett said.\n\nBartlett's point is that most people fall back on artificial constraints and traditions that keep them from pushing back. He cited innovators like fast-fashion company Zara and Bernard Sadow, a pioneer of the rolling suitcase, who challenged those conventions.\n\nBartlett said that, as a result, he prioritizes hiring and has developed a Culture Test, which he turned into a company by the same name.\n\nHe added on the podcast that he had spent \"50% of my month on hiring.\"\n\nBartlett's flagship show, which often ranks at the top of Apple's business podcasts chart, is part of his holding company, Steven.com, which he recently said raised an eight-figure investment. It encompasses businesses like Flight Story, a media and investment company that's expanded into a network of other shows.\n\nBartlett presented another Culture Test scenario on the podcast: Consider what you might do if your biggest client called on Christmas Eve, saying they were logged out of their account. Would you reply immediately, wait until the holidays are over, or send a rude response reminding them it's Christmas? He said that how people react represents the company culture.\n\nAdding some heft to Bartlett's view, research has shown that hiring people for culture fit can lead to higher performance and lower turnover.\n\nThere are potential pitfalls in prioritizing culture fit, however. Critics argue that it can lead employers to hire people who look like or share the same characteristics as existing staff, potentially at the expense of diversity. Research has shown that diverse teams outperform more homogeneous ones.",

    "fullText": "Since going Hollywood in the early 2000s after a sensational pro wrestling career at the WWE, Johnson has gradually built up his box office tally. But the ticket sales got as big as his biceps when he joined the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise with 2011's \"Fast Five.\"\n\nAlong with helping \"Fast\" entries like 2015's \"Furious 7\" and 2017's \"The Fate of the Furious\" each earn over $1 billion at the worldwide box office, he's also scored other big hits like the \"Moana\" and \"Jumanji\" franchises.\n\nAs Captain America, Evans is attached to some of the biggest box office earners of all time, including 2019's \"Avengers: Endgame,\" which is the second-highest-grossing movie of all time at the worldwide box office with over $2.7 billion.\n\nSince then, he's shown up in box office hits like \"Free Guy\" (just a quick cameo, but it still counts) and 2024's \"Deadpool & Wolverine.\"\n\nExpect him to rise up this list with him reprising his role as Captain America in \"Avengers: Doomsday\" coming out at the end of the year.\n\nAs the star in all 10 movies in the \"Fast\" franchise, Vin Diesel is a major part of its over $7 billion take.\n\nDiesel has also scored big as the voice of Groot in the \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" franchise.\n\nAs the face of the Thor franchise, Hemsworth has helped it earn close to $3 billion at the worldwide box office. As a member of \"The Avengers\" franchise, he's also been a part of the close to $8 billion those movies have grossed.\n\nMost recently, he starred in the hit \"Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga.\" He will also be \"Avengers: Doomsday.\"\n\nRegarded as one of the last true movie stars, Cruise was topping box office charts long before most on this list had their first screen credit.\n\nNow in his 60s, Cruise is proving he's still got it as the latest (and perhaps final) \"Mission: Impossible\" movie, \"The Final Reckoning,\" is going strong in theaters, earning half a billion dollars worldwide. That adds to its already impressive tally of close to $5 billion for the eight-movie franchise.\n\nThere's also talk of a third \"Top Gun\" movie after the franchise was revived in 2020 with \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" which brought in $1.4 billion.\n\nWho knew the jokester from \"Parks and Recreation\" would become such a huge box office draw?\n\nFrom playing Star-Lord in the \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" movies (and several other Marvel releases), a lovable Lego figure in the \"The Lego Movie\" franchise, the hero in the \"Jurassic World\" movies, and the voice of Mario in \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie,\" Pratt's hard work has paid off.\n\nBelieve it or not, there was a time when Hollywood wanted nothing to do with Robert Downey Jr.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Downey Jr.'s years of drug use and brushes with the law caught up with him. After spending a year at a court-ordered drug-treatment facility, he was broke and virtually unhireable.\n\nThen he got the offer that led to his comeback: the titular role in 2008's \"Iron Man.\"\n\nWith that, Downey Jr. became the face of the lucrative Marvel Cinematic Universe, which has grossed over $31 billion worldwide to date.\n\nAfter ending his run as Iron Man with 2019's \"Avengers: Endgame,\" the second-highest-grossing movie of all time, he's returning to the MCU as the villain Doctor Doom in \"Avengers: Doomsday.\"\n\nIf there has ever been a blueprint for success in the modern-day movie business, it would be Sam Jackson's filmography.\n\nFrom \"Star Wars\" to the MCU to Pixar's hit \"The Incredibles,\" the actor has been a staple of box-office sensations for decades — and let's not forget all the memorable roles he's played in movies from Spike Lee and Quentin Tarantino.\n\nThis is why he was No. 1 on this list for so many years.\n\nSince showing up as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow in 2010's \"Iron Man 2,\" Johansson has upped her box office game.\n\nAlong with being a fixture in the MCU as a member of The Avengers, she also found big box office dollars starring in movies like \"The Jungle Book\" and \"Sing.\"\n\nAs the face of the latest hit movie in the \"Jurassic Park\" franchise, \"Jurassic World Rebirth,\" which took in close to $870 million at the worldwide box office, Johansson was tops on this list.\n\nThis recent Oscar winner has been on a box office hot streak for years.\n\nBetween playing Uhura in the \"Star Trek\" franchise, Gamora in the \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" movies, and Neytiri in the epic \"Avatar\" films, Saldaña's role choices have been impeccable.\n\nReturning as Neytiri in James Cameron's 2025 hit \"Avatar: Fire & Ash,\" which has scored over $1 billion at the global box office, has placed her as the current highest-grossing actor.",

    "description": "Mark Zandi told Business Insider that the idea to cap credit card interest would hurt borrowers, while Trump's mortgage plan could raise home prices.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has floated some big ideas to make life more affordable for everyday Americans in the last week, but one veteran economist has his doubts that they'll make much of a difference.\n\nIn fact, he sees the plans to lower mortgage rates and cap credit card interest as potentially doing more harm than good.\n\nTrump revealed plans to bring down mortgage rates and make credit card debt cheaper. For mortgages, he said he had directed \"representatives\" to buy $200 billion of mortgage bonds, while his plan for credit cards entails capping interest at 10% for a year.\n\nThe president framed both plans as being in the interest of US consumers, but Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi thinks that both moves could end up having the opposite effect.\n\nZandi spent much of 2025 sounding the alarm over Trump's policies, which he said could push the US toward a recession, and he's remained pessimistic so far in 2026.\n\nZandi posted on X that the news of Trump's housing market plan has already pushed fixed mortgages down by 10 to 20 basis points. While that sounds like good news for borrowers and is likely exactly what Trump wants to see, the sudden dip in rates could ultimately drive home prices up.\n\n\"Unfortunately, this will do little to make homebuying more affordable, as while the lower rates will support housing demand, given the severe housing shortage, it will also result in higher house prices, all else equal,\" he said.\n\nZandi also warned that Trump's intention to use Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to pile up mortgage bonds could pose further complications. He said it would effectively weaken a safeguard imposed on the two mortgage giants following the 2008 housing market crash that was meant to keep them from posing a systemic risk to the economy.\n\nZandi also said he had issues with Trump's credit card idea.\n\nHe told Business Insider that while he sees little chance that Trump's plan for a cap on credit card interest rates would clear legal hurdles, the move would ultimately curtail the availability of credit for borrowers who rely on it.\n\n\"Only consumers with high credit scores would avoid having their credit lines reduced or eliminated altogether,\" he said. \"That's because banks and other credit card lenders simply won't be able to profitably extend credit cards at a 10% rate to many Americans.\"\n\nZandi predicted that higher-income households would benefit from lower rates middle and lower income people would be shut out.\n\nAnalysts at UBS echoed Zandi's perspective on credit card rate caps, arguing that caps on credit card interest could harm not just lower-income consumers but the broader economy, as it would mean less spending. Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman responded with a similar argument, stating that he thinks such a move would be a mistake.",

    "fullText": "Soaring oil prices. Hot inflation. Turmoil in markets.\n\nThat was a dire combination the US economy saw in the 1970s, but analysts say that the risks of another oil price shock — a situation where oil prices abruptly surge and set off a domino effect of negative consequences in markets and the economy —are on the rise as geopolitical conflict escalates.\n\nOil prices spiked in recent weeks as the US conducted its raid on Venezuela and threatened to take military action in Iran — two of the world's largest crude producers.\n\nMarch contracts for Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose 10% in the last week, and jumped by as much as 3% to trade above $65 a barrel on Tuesday. It's the highest price for Brent since November.\n\nShould Brent oil hit $80 a barrel, that would probably constitute an oil price shock, according to José Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers.\n\nIn that scenario, Torres said he believes bonds and stocks would sell off in tandem, as higher energy prices could stoke inflation, which could weigh on economic growth. Higher inflation could also mean the Fed has less room to cut interest rates down the line, a major catalyst that has pushed risk assets higher in the past year.\n\n\"Definitely there's risk for an oil price shock, especially with stocks coming up for three really robust years,\" Torres told Business Insider, referring to the back-to-back years of double-digit gains for the S&P 500.\n\nMatt Gertken, the chief geopolitical strategist at BCA Research, said that recent tensions in Iran have raised the odds of a \"massive global oil supply shock\" to around 40%. Should Iran's regime fall and conflict in the region increase, that could result in a \"significant loss\" in oil production around the region, he wrote in a note to clients this week.\n\n\"Global and US equities are exposed to a correction in the near term given overvalued and overbought conditions and escalating geopolitical risk at the moment,\" Gertken added.\n\nAnalysts at Deutsche Bank also flagged the risk of the market experiencing an oil shock this year.\n\n\"A positive supply shock to oil prices would materially impact inflation expectations and inflation risks,\" the bank wrote in a recent client note, calling the scenario a key risk to their economic outlook.\n\nJeff Currie, a longtime commodities strategist and the chief strategy officer of energy pathways at Carlyle, added that he believes there could be further upside risk to oil prices. He pointed to factors such as high demand for crude and \"quite high\" geopolitical risk, which could make oil more expensive.\n\n\"The situation in Venezuela, the impact on geopolitical risk is very large,\" Currie told CNBC last week. \"For oil importers, whether you're China, India, or Europe, the world got a lot more dangerous.\"",

    "fullText": "The showdown between Elon Musk and Sam Altman is headed to court — and it's set to be a long one.\n\nOakland federal judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers on Tuesday set a new trial date for Musk's legal dispute with OpenAI — one week after saying the Tesla CEO had enough evidence for the case to be decided by a jury.\n\nJury selection is now scheduled to start on Monday, April 27. The trial will start the next day and could last four weeks, through May 22, the court docket showed. The trial had previously been scheduled for March 30.\n\nIt's the latest development in a clash of the tech titans that kicked off last year when Musk sued Altman over the ChatGPT maker's partnership with Microsoft and shift toward a for-profit model. Musk, a founder and early supporter of OpenAI, claims he contributed $38 million to OpenAI over the years under the premise that it would maintain its original altruistic, nonprofit roots.\n\nOpenAI has countered that Musk knew about its pivot toward a for-profit as early as 2018 and says its nonprofit arm still plays a central role in its governance. The company has blasted the lawsuit as baseless and has characterized it as part of a larger harassment campaign by Musk.\n\nLast week, Judge Gonzalez Rogers rejected arguments by Altman's lawyers to block the case from proceeding to trial, saying Musk had sufficient evidence to justify a jury trial.\n\n\"I think there's plenty of evidence,\" the judge said at a hearing on January 7. \"It's circumstantial, but that's how these things work.\"\n\nHundreds of exhibits were unsealed in the case last week, including a 2023 text that revealed tension in the two tech titans' relationship before Musk filed his suit.\n\n\"I don't think openai would have happened without you — and it really fucking hurts when you publicly attack openai,\" Altman texted Musk in 2023.\n\nMusk responded: \"I hear you and it is certainly not my intention to be hurtful, for which I apologize, but the fate of civilization is at stake.\"",

    "description": "With US federal EV incentives gone, Tesla gets back to dominating the US market. It's all about volume and EV manufacturing scale.",
    "fullText": "Federal incentives for electric vehicles disappeared at the end of the third quarter, leaving the US market to survive on its own merits.\n\nSo, how did companies perform in this new, realistic environment?\n\nCox Automotive, an industry data provider, has just released EV sales estimates for the fourth quarter on Tuesday, and the numbers reveal which companies thrive and which struggle without government assistance.\n\nTesla once again dominates the EV market in the US. Its market share surged to 59% in Q4, up from 41% in the previous quarter, Cox data shows.\n\nOne major reason is that EV companies in the US now have to make the numbers work without government help. A significant part of the equation is volume.\n\nDespite a decline in sales recently, Tesla still sold 138,000 EVs in the US during the fourth quarter. That type of volume helps the company maintain relatively low prices while still making money.\n\nMost rivals don't have that volume, and their EV manufacturing operations just aren't as efficient as Tesla's because they still make other types of cars, which have way more parts than EVs. This can make them more expensive to manufacture and can lead to big losses.\n\n\"In the volume-driven business of automotive manufacturing, low volume is the enemy; EV profitability remains a distant dream for nearly every automaker,\" Cox warned last year as federal incentives ended.\n\nFord's EV market share was measly 6% in the fourth quarter, while Rivian's stood at just 4%.\n\nGeneral Motors is performing somewhat better, with a market share of over 10%. Even here, the math just doesn't add up. General Motors took $6 billion in fourth-quarter charges tied to scaling back EV plans in the US.\n\nIn December, Ford abandoned large EVs because it couldn't make a profit on them. The company took a $20 billion write-down on its failing EV business. Rivian still loses a lot of money, although its cheaper R2 EV might improve things later this year.\n\nIn July, Mercedes stopped taking EV orders in the US. Stellantis recently shelved some of its EV plans, along with Porsche and Honda. Even Ferrari, which has juicy profit margins, dialed down its EV plans.\n\nIf EV operations can't reach high-volume scale, they risk constantly losing money. At some point, they have to stop the bleeding. When incentives ended in the US, many players decided to give up.\n\nTesla remains the exception in the US. It's proving that, in this industry, volume equals survival.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Boris Cherny, head of Claude Code, said that Anthropic's AI coded \"pretty much all\" of Cowork, a new tool that's been well-received among techies.",
    "fullText": "Anthropic's new working agent was largely built by Claude itself — the latest example of AI coding tools speeding up product development.\n\nOn Monday, Anthropic announced the release of Cowork, a \"more approachable\" AI tool accompanying Claude Code that's geared toward fulfilling users' requests that are unrelated to programming. Users grant the agentic AI tool access to specific files on their computer and prompt it to complete tasks.\n\nBoris Cherny, head of Claude Code, said that Anthropic's AI coded \"pretty much all\" of Cowork.\n\n\"@claudeai wrote Cowork,\" Product Manager Felix Rieseberg wrote on X. \"Us humans meet in-person to discuss foundational architectural and product decisions, but all of us devs manage anywhere between 3 to 8 Claude instances implementing features, fixing bugs, or researching potential solutions.\"\n\nAs a result, Rieseberg said the first edition of Cowork came together quickly.\n\n\"This is the product that my team has built here, we sprinted at this for the last week and a half,\" he said during a livestream with Dan Shipper.\n\nOver the holidays, Rieseberg said that Anthropic saw its customers using Claude for an increasing number of non-coding-related tasks.\n\n\"This sort of like the research preview, very early Alpha, a lot of rough edges, as you've already seen, right?\" he said.\n\nCowork is initially available to Claude Max subscribers on the Mac app.\n\nThe launch has made a splash in the tech world, with many online users praising the product and its accessibility.\n\n\"I think that's a really smart product,\" Datasette co-creator Simon Willison wrote in a blog about his experience. \"Claude Code has an enormous amount of value that hasn't yet been unlocked for a general audience, and this seems like a pragmatic approach.\"\n\n\"This is big,\" Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian wrote on X.\n\nBecause granting an AI agent access and the ability to take action on specific computer files comes with risk, Anthropic cautions that Cowork users should be careful.\n\n\"By default, the main thing to know is that Claude can take potentially destructive actions (such as deleting local files) if it's instructed to,\" the company said. \"Since there's always some chance that Claude might misinterpret your instructions, you should give Claude very clear guidance around things like this. \"\n\nAI companies wasted no time in launching new offerings and partnerships to kick off the new year.\n\nOn Sunday, Anthropic announced Claude for Healthcare, a major addition to its healthcare and life sciences offerings. Its release came on the heels of rival OpenAI signaling its investment in the healthcare space with ChatGPT Health.\n\nAmid AI bubble chatter and scrutiny on the increasing AI investments made by tech companies, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has argued that Anthropic has built a more sustainable business model that allowed it to make more educated bets on its future build-out. While he did not name OpenAI or CEO Sam Altman directly, he made some thinly veiled criticisms of his former company throughout the event.\n\n\"I think because we focus on enterprise, I think we have a better business model,\" Amodei said at The New York Times' Dealbook Summit. \"I think we have better margins. I think we're being responsible about it.\"\n\nGoogle, which some experts saw as overtaking OpenAI at the end of 2025, announced a major deal with Apple to have Gemini power Siri's artificial intelligence capabilities.",

    "description": "Delta's big order for Boeing 787 Dreamliners underlines its strategy to compete with rivals American and United for premium long-haul travelers.",
    "fullText": "Delta Air Lines is entering its Dreamliner era.\n\nIts order of up to 60 Boeing 787-10 planes reinforces Delta's broader strategy of competing aggressively for premium long-haul travelers — a segment that has made the transatlantic market increasingly lucrative.\n\nThe new planes for long-haul routes will add pressure on US rivals American and United, which are also competing for the same international travelers, especially those in premium cabins that generate the most profit for airlines, including Delta.\n\nDelta is hoping for a bigger piece of that pie.\n\nIt said the new 787 cabins will feature its signature Delta One business class alongside premium economy and standard coach. United has been particularly aggressive with niche transatlantic routes, while American has rolled out a new business-class product on its Dreamliners.\n\nDelta's new jets won't arrive until the next decade. Until then, Delta will continue flying its aging 767s, which the Dreamliners will eventually replace.\n\nDelta President Glen Hauenstein said in the airline's earnings call on Tuesday that the 787 is a \"financially great airplane\" that offers enhanced cargo capacity, improved fuel efficiency, and ample space for those all-important premium cabins.\n\nMeanwhile, Hauenstein said the airline would grow capacity by 3% this year, with new seat growth concentrated in premium cabins.\n\nDelta didn't disclose how much it was paying for the new planes.\n\nIt's the airline's first direct order of the popular jet, which has garnered more than 2,000 global orders. It represents a shift in its long-haul fleet strategy. Delta bought 30 and has options for 30 more.\n\nDelta's purchase of Boeing 787s is significant for an airline that has long been dominated by Airbus on the widebody side.\n\nThe airline inherited a 787 order through its merger with Northwest Airlines back in 2008, but canceled it in 2016, citing delays, quality issues, and a preference for Airbus.\n\nIt opted for Airbus A330neo and A350-900 as its next-generation long-haul workhorses, and it expects to receive the larger A350-1000 later this year.\n\nThe addition of the 787‑10 diversifies and further modernizes the fleet. The variant ordered is the largest of the Dreamliner family, seating up to 336 passengers, but has the shortest range at roughly 7,300 miles.\n\nStill, it outpaces the aging Boeing 767s that Hauenstein said the Dreamliner is set to replace, meaning it can carry more passengers more efficiently on both existing and new long-haul routes.\n\nDelta's 767s primarily fly to Europe and South America, where the airline said the 787 would be an \"ideal addition.\"\n\nThe order is a notable boost in confidence for Boeing, which has faced labor strikes, a change in leadership, and significant quality control issues for years — including on the 787 — but is gradually rebuilding trust from customers, investors, and regulators.\n\nThe 787 deal comes alongside Delta's better-than-expected earnings report for the fourth quarter and full-year 2025.\n\nIts net income was about $5 billion, largely driven by continued strong premium and corporate demand, though main‑cabin ticket revenue fell about 7% year-over-year.\n\nThe airline previously said the government shutdown shaved roughly $200 million off its pre-tax profit after regulators forced airlines to reduce flying by 10% to alleviate congestion and ensure safety.\n\nDelta's stock slipped after its earnings report, but it has still gained about 6% over the past year.",

    "description": "\"Who's going to watch an NFL game on the internet?\" More than 31 million people, it turns out.",
    "fullText": "On Saturday, the Chicago Bears beat the Green Bay Packers in an NFL playoff game that had everything: a bitter rivalry, an old-school outdoors atmosphere, and a historic comeback (or choke-job, depending on your POV).\n\nIt also happened to be a (mostly) streaming-only game. Did you notice? Or care?\n\nI didn't. Except for about 30 seconds, when I was trying to find out what network was showing the game, and it took me a beat to realize it was on Amazon's Prime Video. Then I booted up my app and watched the game without any issue. Just like any other NFL game.\n\nIn 2026, \"Guy doesn't have a problem watching the Bears/Packers\" is a true dog-bites-man story. But that's why I'm writing about it here: Not very long ago, the idea of streaming a super-high-profile NFL game — and requiring NFL fans to \n\nNow it's a yawner: I was one of 31.6 million people who watched the game, the vast majority of whom streamed it (fans in local markets could use broadcast TV). That's a streaming record for an NFL game, and it's more than some other games got last weekend on conventional TV.\n\nAnd that tells you just how far sports and streaming have come.\n\nFlash back to 2013, for instance, and the idea of whether the \"internet\" — a catch-all term that included everything needed to get streaming video onto your screen, from web servers to fiber-optic lines to the router in your house — could support a big NFL game watched by many millions of people was an open question. \"Why Web TV Skeptic Mark Cuban Thinks Google Can Make the NFL Work on the Web,\" was an ungainly headline I tapped out at the time.\n\nBack then, the NFL and other sports giants were routinely streaming big events like the Super Bowl and World Cup — but only as a sort of secondary outlet for weirdos who didn't have traditional TV. And anyone who did stream sports had to expect to run into problems, like ESPN did when it streamed a World Cup game in 2014.\n\nA year later, the NFL put on a streaming-only game for the first time — but made sure it was a relatively niche one, and made sure that people knew it was an experiment.\n\nCut to today, and streaming is just a way we watch some football games now. Amazon pays a gazillion dollars a year to show one game a week during the regular season; Netflix has paid up to show a couple games on Christmas Day. A new deal the NFL struck with Disney last year will give the league the opportunity to sell even more games to digital players.\n\nAnd two years ago, the league passed another new threshold by moving one of its most valuable assets — a playoff game — to Comcast's Peacock streamer, where it was only available to paid subscribers. That one generated a ton of complaints from people who said they didn't want to pay another service to watch an NFL game — along with millions of sign-ups for Peacock, which showed they would.\n\nThe NFL is not ditching TV for streaming anytime soon. For many people, watching NFL games is the main reason to watch TV, and that gives the league a ton of leverage to extract ever-increasing fees from the likes of NBC and CBS. So they will almost certainly keep the majority of their games on old-time TV for the foreseeable future. But they're going to sell them to streaming platforms too — because they'll pay up to get them, and you'll pay, too.",

    "description": "Ford, seeking to fill 5,000 open positions at its dealerships, is teaming with Carhartt in an effort to boost the auto technician pipeline.",
    "fullText": "America is running low on mechanics, electricians, and plumbers.\n\nFord thinks it can help solve the problem by getting younger workers under the hood of its new pickup trucks, enticing them with free Carhartt gear and tools.\n\nThe automaker and 137-year-old workwear brand told Business Insider they're launching a multi-year partnership to address what both call a looming workforce crisis.\n\nThe partnership aims to train thousands of blue collar workers, a bet that the two Detroit-based brands can reinvigorate America's manual labor pipeline.\n\nThe partnership includes three main components: opening a ToolBank USA location in Detroit that will lend 25,000 tools annually to workers and volunteers, outfitting Ford's auto tech scholars with free Carhartt workwear, and launching a co-branded products for the public.\n\nFord is also donating an F-150 to ToolBank to extend the program's mobile reach. The two companies declined to disclose the financial terms.\n\nThe partnership comes as Ford CEO Jim Farley has warned that America will face a critical shortage of skilled tradespeople within five to ten years. The company calls these workers the backbone of the \"essential economy.\"\n\nFor Ford, the deficit is top of mind, as the company needs thousands of auto technicians to staff its dealership service bays. Right now, the company says it has 5,000 open positions at its dealerships, including six-figure technician jobs.\n\n\"The problems with the essential economy are problems for all of us,\" Farley said in September at Ford's inaugural workforce development summit, which convened industry leaders and policymakers to address the trades pipeline crisis. \"We stopped investing in the trades. If Henry Ford saw what has become of us, I think he'd be kind of mad.\"\n\nIn a phone interview with Business Insider, Mary Culler, the president of Ford Philanthropy, said part of Ford's mechanic pipeline issue is a perception problem.\n\nFord's current vehicle lineup includes advanced driver-assist systems like backup cameras, lane monitors, and autonomous features — making today's auto repair roles far more technical than traditional mechanic jobs.\n\n\"People we talk to tell us, 'I didn't realize it wasn't the greasy job I expected,'\" Culler said. \"People don't understand that it's a very high-tech job, it's a very computer-intensive job.\"\n\nFord Philanthropy has been offering $5,000 scholarships to trade- school-level technicians through TechForce Foundation, a third-party nonprofit that provides scholarships for skilled trades education. Now, participants will also receive head-to-toe Carhartt gear, including pants, shirts, and vests.\n\nStudent applicants must prove they're studying the auto technology industries to be eligible.\n\n\"Some of this work is put in the philanthropic realm,\" Culler added. \"But this is a business imperative for the future of the economy and our country. We really need to close this gap on these skill trades.\"\n\nSo far, the program hasn't yet kept pace with Ford's needs. The company has trained 1,400 technicians through TechForce since 2018 — filling less than a third of its current 5,000 open positions in seven years.\n\nBut recent jobs numbers show there is growing interest in the sector, according to LinkedIn data released last year. Half way through the year, many of the fastest-growing job titles for young workers were blue-collar, like construction workers, electricians, and mining workers.\n\nFor mechanics, cost can be another barrier, as mechanics typically need to buy or rent their own thousand-dollar toolkits.\n\nCuller said Ford provides wraparound support including tool kits and transportation to training facilities. The automaker is also working to expand participants' sense of career possibilities beyond traditional dealership roles.\n\n\"We've taken some of the scholars to F1 and Nascar races to show them that it might not be a dealership where they end up working,\" Culler said. \"You could work for a race team.\"\n\nFor Carhartt, the partnership serves dual purposes: recruiting workers for its Kentucky and Tennessee manufacturing facilities, and cultivating what it hopes could be lifetime customers. Someone who starts wearing Carhartt gear at age 20 as a Ford tech scholar could be a customer for the next 40 years.\n\nCarhartt doesn't require four-year degrees at its plants and has partnered with organizations like the National Center for Construction and Engineering Research to connect high schoolers with trades careers.\n\n\"To me, it's a bigger calling to amplify people who wear Carhartt,\" Linda Hubbard, CEO of Carhartt, told Business Insider. \"You might start out as a laborer in the trades, but you could end up owning your own business. I see a lot of these folks working their way up from the field into management into CEO positions.\"\n\nHubbard said she wants Carhartt outfitting those workers throughout their careers, from first day at the repair shop, to their last day running their own companies. Ford, meanwhile, hopes those same workers choose its trucks as their daily drivers for decades.\n\nThe commercial partnership will extend to consumer products too.\n\nCarhartt will launch Ford co-branded apparel, while Ford will unveil a Super Duty Carhartt edition truck. Both arrive in the back half of 2026 — the companies declined to share pricing or additional product details.\n\nBoth brands are betting their Detroit heritage and cultural cachet can make trades careers more appealing to younger workers.\n\n\"We're raising the perception and elevating the importance of these jobs,\" Culler said. \"But there's a real gap. We know there's a real crisis.\n\n\"Carhartt is super cool, we think Ford is super cool. Hopefully we can get the younger generation to recognize this is a real opportunity.\"",

    "description": "Jimmy Donaldson, the world’s most popular YouTuber and founder of $5 billion business Beast Industries, claims he doesn’t “technically” have enough money to buy McDonald’s in the morning.",
    "fullText": "Some successful entrepreneurs sitting atop billion-dollar businesses say they may look rich on paper, but take a peek into their bank accounts, and they’re actually cash poor. Social media mogul Jimmy Donaldson, known to his 460 million YouTube followers as MrBeast, claims he’s just as broke as everyone else despite running a $5 billion entertainment empire.\n\n“I’m borrowing money. That’s how little money I have,” Donaldson told the Wall Street Journal earlier this month. “Technically, everyone watching this video has more money than me in their bank account if you subtract the equity value of my company, which doesn’t buy me McDonald’s in the morning.”\n\nThe 27-year-old entrepreneur has said that he keeps less than $1 million for himself, despite being a billionaire and owning more than half of his $5 billion company Beast Industries. Aside from his nine-figure Amazon deal and popular YouTube channel with 107 billion lifetime views, Donaldson hit the ultra-rich club—at least on paper—from a slew of successful businesses. He’s launched ventures including multimillion-dollar chocolate brand Feastables; Lunchly, a Lunchables-esque packaged food product; MrBeast Burger, a virtual restaurant that only allows for pickup and drop-off; and production company MrBeast LLC, which helps manufacture his viral videos.\n\nThrough his assets, Donaldson is projected to be worth at least $2.6 billion—although he emphasized it’s not a fat wad of cash burning a hole in his pocket. Forbes has also estimated that his annual earnings reached $85 million between April 2024 and April 2025, a far cry from the typical American salary of $62,088 a year. However, that doesn’t mean he’s splurging on luxuries and only flying private. Donaldson claimed he’s actually in the red.\n\n“It’s funny talking about my personal finances, because no one ever believes anything I say,” Donaldson explained. “They’re like, ‘You’re a billionaire!’ I’m like, ‘That’s net worth.’ I have negative money right now.”\n\n“I wake up, I just work…I’m just so busy working I don’t really think about my personal bank account,” Donaldson continued. “I’m just laser-focused on making the greatest videos as possible, and building the business as big as possible.”\n\nDonaldson rakes in eight-figure earnings and runs a $5 billion business, yet still claims to be broke.

    "title": "The Seven Best Tool Box Accessories Everyone Should Have",
    "description": "Just like your tools, you could be getting more out of your trusty tool box.",
    "fullText": "Every self-respecting DIYer eventually buys a tool box—a sturdy place to store, organize, and protect your valuable tools. A quality metal tool box instantly ups your home maintenance and repair game—suddenly, you no longer have to spend twenty minutes rooting around for that pair of pliers or that box of random screws, because everything is in its place. And that place can often roll around and follow you to wherever you need to work.\n\nTool boxes are terrific, but that doesn’t mean they can’t be improved and augmented. Whether your tool box is a small, efficient unit or a behemoth with deep drawers and pull-out trays, you could be getting more out of it with a few simple additions. If you’re looking to squeeze a little more juice out of your tool box set-up, here are the tool box accessories you should be considering.\n\nI used to keep all the spray cans in my life—the lubricants, adhesives, and paints—on a little shelf in my work room, and they kept being knocked off onto the floor. And, inevitably, I would already be knee-deep in a project when I realized I needed one of them, and I would have to troop back to my tool closet to grab them. Instead of doing that, invest in a spray can caddy like these. They slap onto the side of your metal tool box and hold all your cans of paint or WD-40 so they’re always at hand and never lost.\n\nYou often need more than one drill, driver, or blower for a job, and having them scattered all over the work site is never ideal. This magnetic power tool holder slaps onto the side of your tool box and makes it easy to slot in up to three tools for easy access. This also keeps those bulky tools out of the tool box itself, freeing up space for more tools while ensuring that your power tools are always in the same spot when you need them.\n\nWe all know what happens to wrenches and pliers in your standard tool box: They get shoved into a drawer and jumbled up, and you spend more time picking through them trying to find the size you need than you do actually using them. A magnetic organizer like this one solves that problem, at least for your wrenches, keeping them easily accessible and organized. Interior organizers like this also make sense, and can accommodate pliers as well as wrenches, keeping things tidy in your tool box’s drawers and saving you a little time whenever you grab one—time that adds up over the course of a project.\n\nNothing is more useful on a tool box than accessories that let you temporarily store stuff. A folding shelf like this one designed for Milwaukee’s popular Packout Tool Box is incredibly useful when you need to have hand tools or fasteners in reach. If you can’t find a shelf designed for your specific tool box, there are magnetic kits like this that will work with any metal tool box, giving you some quick storage when you need it. One genius thing included in that kit is the towel holder—the simple convenience of being able to grab a paper towel as needed is worth every penny. You can also find magnetic towel holders on their own if that’s the only thing your tool box lacks.\n\nCordless power tools may have mostly freed us from the outlet—but not every tool can (or should) be cordless, and sometimes you need a handy power source. Adding a magnetic power strip to the exterior or interior of your tool box means you can plug in that legacy corded tool, charge up batteries, or plug in anything else you might need, from lights to your dying phone.\n\nYou probably have a magnetic tool holder in your workshop or tool closet already, so why not add one to your tool box? Aside from giving you more storage options, a magnetic strip lets you slap your tools into place as you need them, without losing them in the depths of a drawer or leaving them behind when you drop them on the floor and move away as you work.\n\nHonestly, cup holders should be built into everything. Having a beverage at hand while you work—whether it’s water to hydrate, coffee to wake and warm up, or a beer to settle your nerves after discovering yet another disaster brewing in your house, a simple magnetic cup holder for your tool box just makes every DIY project a little nicer.",

    "description": "It's perfect for silencing group chats, spammy apps, or irrelevant news.",
    "fullText": "We all know how annoying unwanted notifications are, especially when you're trying to focus. But turning notifications off entirely for a given app potentially means missing important messages. That's where the free Android app DoNotNotify comes in—with it you can set up custom filters for notifications.\n\nMaybe you're in a group chat that is, for the most part, useful, but includes one person who talks too much. With this application, you could filter that person out, meaning you'd only get notifications when anyone else sends a message. You could also use this to filter news notifications about particular subjects or public figures you'd rather not see pop-ups about. You get the idea.\n\nThe application itself is deceptively simple. Launch it and you'll need to give it permissions to access your notifications. Once you do, it will start collecting a log of notifications. You can tap any of these notifications in order to set up a rule.\n\nThe first thing you need to decide is whether you want to create a blacklist or a whitelist. You can add filters for the title of the notification (the bolded part at the top of the notification) or the text (which is the excerpt below the title).\n\nThe whitelist feature is great when you only want certain notifications from your apps. For example: Maybe your banking app sends out notifications about your credit score, which you want to see, but also promotions for other services, which you don't. You could whitelist the words \"credit score.\" The same goes for news applications—maybe you only want to see headlines from a particular app when the headline mentions a certain country or public figure.\n\nBlacklists, meanwhile, allow you to do the opposite. The group text example I gave earlier is an example of this. You could also use blacklists to prevent certain public figures or topics from showing up in notifications from news applications.\n\nIt's worth noting that the application needs access to your notifications in order to filter them, meaning it could potentially gather a lot of information about you—concerns were raised about this on Hacker News. On the other hand, the app's privacy policy is quite robust, claiming not to collect any information and not to work with any third parties.\n\nI don't think this is the kind of application every person is going to want—it's for the obsessive. If that's you, though, and you get annoyed by notifications often, you should give this a try.",

    "title": "How Your Child's Google Account Changes When They Turn 13",
    "description": "They can take on a lot more responsibility, if they choose to.",
    "fullText": "The internet is a wild place, and not particularly kid-friendly. Unfortunately, it's highly impractical to keep your kids entirely off the web. That's where family accounts come in handy: Parents can set their kids up with supervised accounts, giving them access to essential apps and services, without allowing unfettered access to the entire net. It's often imperfect, and kids find workarounds for the guardrails, but still; it's better than nothing.\n\nEvery company that offers a family account handles things differently. Meta, for example, continues to update their policies in the wake of criticism surrounding how addictive and harmful their apps can be for children. These days, teens have to deal with a number of limitations they didn't previously have: While users 16 and older can remove these limitations if they wish, those under 16 need a parent's consent to do so. That means things like screen time, going live on Instagram, and DMs are all blocked and controlled by the parent for users 15 and under.\n\nIf you're the administrator of a Google Family Account, you might assume you have a similar level of control over your kids' Google accounts. Perhaps you imagine it's like Meta: When they're old enough, maybe something like 16, they can decide for themselves what level of access they have on their account, but until then, you'd have the final say. As it turns out, that's not the case. In fact, you really only have that control until your kid turns 13.\n\nI first came across this issue from this LinkedIn post from user Melissa McKay. McKay, frustrated, shared how she received an email from Google, alerting her that her youngest child will soon have the option to remove supervision on their Google Account once they turn 13. According to the attached screenshots, the email says that once the child turns 13, they'll be able to access more Google apps and services, and customize their Google Account to make it their own. McKay summed up her discontent with the following: \"Call it what it is. Grooming for engagement. Grooming for data. Grooming minors for profit.\"\n\nThe post currently has over 6,400 reactions on LinkedIn, which is relatively viral for the platform. Since I don't have kids, this is the first I'm hearing about these rules. But a quick search pulls up Google's official support doc on the subject. Indeed, when a child turns 13 (or an applicable age due to the law of the country or region) they are given the choice to either continue on with parental supervision, or manage their own Google Account.\n\nHere's what that means for your child:\n\nThey'll no longer have access to YouTube Kids, but will have access to general YouTube. Google will also disable supervised YouTube experiences.\n\nThey'll be able to add payment cards to Google Wallet or Google Pay, and can remove cards from their phone or watch, as well.\n\nThey'll be able to use these cards for tap to pay, in-app payments, website payments via Google Pay, autofill, as well as various payments across Google services, like the Play Store and YouTube.\n\nAnd here's what that means for you, as their parent:\n\nYou can no longer set up supervision features like downtime, app blocking, or mandatory location sharing. (Your child can choose to share their location, if they want to.)\n\nYou can no longer see your child's transactions or get notifications when they make new purchases.\n\nYou can't add or remove payment cards for your kid.\n\nYou can't block their access to Wallet passes.\n\nOf course, these changes are contingent on your child's decision to remove the supervision. They can choose to keep it on, and, as such, you can continue to monitor and administer your kid's account. However, I can imagine many 13 year olds will choose to remove supervision, unless they're particularly agreeable. As such, you effectively lose control when your child does turn 13.\n\nInterestingly, Google says that once a child removes supervision without your permission, their device is locked \"temporarily.\" It's not clear whether this means that the parent device needs to unlock the device, or if this just a cool down period, and the device will unlock on its own. I've reached out to Google for clarity here.\n\nEven though Google allows kids to lift restrictions when they turn 13, they don't have total access to all of Google's services. According to this support doc, there are some key age-restricted content and services that require users to be 18 or older, including:\n\nThat's it, at least according to Google's safety doc. I've reached out to Google again for clarity on what other restrictions are in place on accounts between ages 13 and 18, and will update this article when I know more.\n\nThis is all changing, however. Kate Charlet, Google's head of global privacy, safety, and security, posted on LinkedIn as well, acknowledging the current policy and asserting that Google has changes in the works. Soon enough, Google will require both the child and the parent to agree to lift supervision. That should help parents who aren't ready to let their 13 year old access standard YouTube and other Google services without their permission.\n\nOf course, for parents that have already received an email about their kids reaching \"the age of digital consent,\" this might not offer much solace.",

    "title": "This Little-Known Peloton Feature Customizes Instructor-Led Classes for You",
    "description": "You can personalize how much instruction you get in Peloton classes.",
    "fullText": "I have taught spin classes for four years, but the majority of my friends have never taken one—they're just not \"class\" people. Everyone works out differently and classes are a very specific kind of experience. I take a class nearly every day, whether in-person or using my Peloton, so obviously I am firmly in the pro-class category, but I can understand why being blabbed at by an instructor wouldn't motivate some people. I learned recently, though, that Peloton offers a solution to those who don't enjoy all the yap: You can actually customize how much of their in-app instructors you hear, so whether you want to pay close attention to cues or hear practically nada from the teacher, you can make it happen, creating a truly custom \"class\" experience.\n\nIf you're using a Peloton machine, like the Bike or the Tread, locate the volume buttons on your touchscreen. When you press them, not only can you control the overall volume output of the class you're taking, but you get options like Boost instructor and Customize. When you tap Customize, you're presented with a slider that can reduce the volume of the instructor down to practically nothing or boost them so they're significantly louder than the music in the class's playlist.\n\nOn the mobile app, you have a similar option for classes that don't require the brand's proprietary cardio equipment, though it's not always as customizable. First, load up a class (like stretching or yoga). The video of the instructor walking you through it will start to play. Tap the video itself and you'll get a menu of icons that show what appears to be a phone turning on its side (to play the video full-screen), a volume slider, a Bluetooth caster to enable AirPlay across other devices in the area, and a speech bubble for subtitles. Tap that volume slider, the second icon from the left. It opens an Audio Mix box that allows you to choose whether you want Music Boosted or Instructor Boosted. You can't control the mix between the music and the instructor as precisely as you can when you're using the equipment, but you can at least prioritize the music or the teacher.\n\nSome of Peloton's instructors are notoriously chatty. Personally, I think it's endearing and I see nothing wrong with the parasocial relationships it creates if those motivate someone to hop on their Bike more often. The instructors are beamed into hundreds of thousands of homes every month and are akin to celebrities, so it's good for marketing and engagement if users feel connected to them, especially because at-home workouts are otherwise pretty isolating (although Peloton offers plenty of other ways to replicate the feeling of connectedness you get from in-person classes, like Teams competitions).\n\nStill, some people aren't trying to replicate that feeling; they just want to work out by themselves with no chatter. Usually, that means loading up your own music or taking one of Peloton's scenic rides, but the trade-off there is that you don't get a well-planned workout designed by a professional trainer, like you do when you take an instructor-led class. You trade the suggested resistance and speed for something self-paced, which can be detrimental to motivation or effort. By cutting down the volume of the instructor's mic and amplifying the playlist, you get to take a real class, follow along with the resistance and speed cues on the screen, and listen to a playlist you don't have to bother curating. If you don't care what a teacher had for breakfast but do care to follow along with a 45-minute progressive push because it aligns with your fitness goals, turning down the instructor volume could be for you.\n\nThat said, there is a reason these classes are instructor-led. Teachers are certified for a reason and the ones on high-profile platforms like Peloton are well-credentialed. They provide safety cues, insights into why playlists and rides are structured the way they are, and helpful information you can carry into your self-led workouts—plus motivation when you need it. I wouldn't recommend cutting out the instructor volume if you're a beginner. There is value in hearing what a pro has to say about form, speed, and self-pacing. You should only cut it out if you're a seasoned rider with good form and a solid understanding of your own abilities and limits. That said, if you're just getting started with Peloton and have concerns about your form or understanding of the workouts, it might even be worth it for you to use this feature the opposite way, prioritizing the instructor feed and deprioritizing the music. Riding to the beat will come in time, but doing it safely and effectively is most important.\n\nIf you're a newbie and you don't like instructor chatter, I recommend filtering your classes so you only take ones from the less-talkative teachers, like Ben Alldis, Sam Yo, Matt Wilpers, and Leanne Hainsby. It might take you some time to find the instructor whose methods align best with your interests and motivators, but it's worth it. You can also take specialty Metrics classes, which are designed to focus more heavily on performance metrics like cadence, resistance, and output. Those have less talking overall.",

    "title": "I Finally Got My Hands on Oura’s New Charging Case",
    "description": "At $99, it's more expensive than other brands' cases, but it's also slimmer.",
    "fullText": "Oura announced last week that its long-awaited charging case is finally shipping. I got one to try out, and can confirm that it works well and is arguably better designed than those of its competitors. That said, is it really worth $99?\n\nThe charging case works with the Oura Ring 4, not the older models like the gen 3. I’ve previously reviewed the Oura Ring 4, and it’s probably the best smart ring out there right now. You pay a premium for it, though—not only are Oura’s prices higher than many of its competitors ($349 to $499), Oura also requires a $5.99/month subscription to access nearly all of its features.\n\nThe standard charger that ships with any of the Oura rings is a simple flat square with a post that the ring fits onto. (The square base then plugs into a USB-C cord.) This works fine, but it’s inconvenient to travel with, and also susceptible to jostling. Maybe you never bump things around on your nightstand, or snag a charging cable, but it’s certainly happened to me.\n\nLike other Oura users, I’ve been wishing for a charging case. RingConn and Luna Ring both come with cases, so it would be nice if Oura would catch up. I usually keep my ring in my gym bag during weightlifting workouts (since it’s neither comfortable nor useful in those workouts). I plan to keep the charging case in my gym bag and use it during workouts.\n\nOura says the case holds enough power for five full charges of the ring, and it takes up to 80 minutes to charge the ring (less if the ring is partially charged, obviously). The case itself charges in 90 minutes.\n\nI haven’t been able to test the case in the long term, since I just got it, but the ring has a battery life of five days or more depending on the size of the ring and the settings you have enabled. That means you could go about a month without charging from a cable.\n\nThe case is sized to your ring, so you have to make sure to buy the correct size of charging case—for example, a size 8 case for a size 8 ring.\n\nThere’s a colored LED on the front of the charging case. When a ring is inside and charging, a white LED will pulse, just like the nightstand charger does. When the case is empty and open, it will indicate the case’s charge level. Green means the battery is full. The case pairs to your Oura app, so you can check the app to see the charge level of both your ring and the case.\n\nI happen to have a Luna Ring and a RingConn gen 2, which both ship with a charging case. Luna’s case holds about 30 days of charge, similar to Oura’s, while RingConn says its case can hold 150 days of charge.\n\nThe other noticeable difference is size. RingConn’s case is the largest of the three, which probably explains its longer battery life. Oura’s case is slightly wider than Luna’s, but slimmer. You can see the size differences in my photos here.\n\nRingConn’s case comes with the ring, and costs $299 for the package. Luna charges $329 for a ring plus charging case. (I recall Luna’s charging case being optional, and available for an extra $49, as I wrote here, but right now I can only find the package deal on their site.) Oura’s charging case is sold separately, for $99, so you’d spend $448 to $598 for the ring plus the case.",

    "description": "Even if you've checked it before, make sure RCS chat is enabled for your non-iMessage chats.",
    "fullText": "Hey, would you mind doing me a favor real quick? If you're on an iPhone, can you double check that you've got RCS chat enabled for me? Thanks, I appreciate it. See, as an Android user, I don't get to use all the fun iMessage features, but RCS lets us share some of them. The only problem is, iPhones seem to sometimes disable RCS for some chats after an update. Or for no reason at all.\n\nRCS has been around for a while, but since it needs to be supported on both the carrier and device level, it's taken some time to reach ubiquity. Understandably, you might have seen some chat conversations between iOS and Android users that still default to the older SMS-style texting, and just gone about your day. However, these days, if you're chatting with your Android friends and you don't see read receipts, or your pictures and videos are coming through in potato quality, there's probably an easy fix.\n\nTo check if RCS is enabled on your phone:\n\nOpen the Settings app on your iOS device, then go to Apps.\n\nEnable the RCS Messaging toggle.\n\nAnd that's it! If you text your contacts from multiple devices, it's also worth checking for RCS support on each of them. It might be a little annoying, but trust me, your Android friends will thank you.\n\nIf you're the one using an Android phone, it can also be worth double-checking that RCS support is enabled, although it's less likely to be a problem. While iOS devices support both iMessage and RCS as robust texting options, Android only has RCS. Both platforms can fall back to SMS, but your Android phone probably reaches for RCS as a default.\n\nStill, it can't hurt to check. The specific directions will differ based on manufacturer, but generally you can go to your default messaging app's settings and look for an \"RCS Chats\" section to make sure the protocol is enabled on your end as well.",

    "title": "Google Is Changing Its Account Policy About Minors Who Turn 13",
    "description": "They now need a parent's permission before removing supervision on their Google Account.",
    "fullText": "If you have a Family Account through Google, you might assume you can control what your child can see or do on their device. You can, but, as it happens, only up to a certain point. When your kid turns 13, Google will send them an email, letting them know they can choose to disable your supervision over their account. You get an email too, but they don't need your permission to lock you out of their device. Once they decide they're ready for a relatively complete Google Account experience, it's their choice to make.\n\nDespite being Google's official policy, this situation was not common knowledge. Following a relatively viral LinkedIn post about the subject, parents were peeved at the notion of Google deciding that their 13 year old was ready to be unsupervised on the internet. Google's Family Account does allow kids to stay on supervised plans after they turn 13, but they can choose to remove the supervision at any point, which largely defeats the purpose. Unless your child really respects your rules, they likely won't keep their account locked down when they don't have to.\n\nLuckily for parents, that's now changing. In a separate LinkedIn post, Google's Kate Charlet announced that under a planned policy update, minors will need to get their parents' permission before disabling supervision. (Charlet also referred to turning 13 as the \"age of digital consent,\" which seems to me to be an extremely strange way to say \"old enough to have an unsupervised Google Account.\")\n\nWhen I reached out to Google about the changes, the company told me that the policy should now be adjusted. As such, 13-year-olds shouldn't be able to remove supervision without permission. That said, Google's support documents have not yet been updated, so it might take some time to fully roll out.\n\nSpeaking of Google's former support documents, the company notes that when kids did choose to remove permissions, their device would lock up temporarily. When I asked Google about this, I was told that due to the change in policy, device lock is no longer a feature. However, it's still unclear to me how this feature worked when kids could remove permissions on their own: Did parents have to manually unlock the device for their kids? Would devices unlock after a set period of time? I've reached back out to Google about these questions, though they might not matter once teens need their parents' permission.\n\nAs I explain in my post here, removing supervision takes a lot of controls away from parents, and gives teens a lot more responsibility. Parents can't control screen time, manage payment cards and transactions, and can't block standard YouTube in favor of YouTube Kids. In addition, kids can choose to stop sharing their location with you if they want to.\n\nBut now that parents have the authority here, these controls can continue for your 13-year-old. If you want them to keep their location turned on, they won't have the option to turn it off; if you want to monitor their transactions, they can't stop you; if you don't want them having a credit card, they won't be able to add one—at least, until you manually disable supervision on your end.\n\nIt's a good thing that Google is giving families more options, and it joins other big tech companies, like Meta, doing the same.",

    "fullText": "New Chelsea manager Liam Rosenior has pledged to speak to Raheem Sterling and Axel Disasi, who have been left in limbo as part of the so-called 'bomb squad'.\n\nThe 41-year-old Englishman, who replaced Enzo Maresca last week, is working through an extensive list of tasks after joining mid-season from Strasbourg, which shares ownership with Chelsea.\n\nOne priority is to speak to Sterling and Disasi, who joined during the 2023-24 season for £47.5m and £38.5m respectively, but are currently training at different times, on a separate pitch and in a separate building from the main squad. Both remain on the transfer list and turned down potential loan moves over the summer.\n\nAsked about the pair, Rosenior said: \"I will have conversations with them. We're in January, as you know.\n\n\"Raheem's had an outstanding career. I've got huge respect for him. Axel is someone I've really, really liked as a player for a long time.\n\n\"Honestly, I have to have a conversation with them. I have to have a conversation with the club. I'm being genuinely honest. I literally have got to work through a list of priorities. I will do in the next few days.\"\n\nSterling is attracting interest from Napoli, while Roma and Lyon have explored a move for Disasi, but Chelsea currently have a maximum of six players out on overseas loans, per Fifa's rules, and would have to cancel one to allow the pair to move on a temporary deal.\n\nChelsea are usually active in every transfer window but have had a slow start to January following the managerial change. Insiders insist the club's strategy will remain similar, although Rosenior's voice will now be part of the discussion after Maresca's falling out with the hierarchy led to his unplanned mid-season exit.\n\nOn potential signings, Rosenior added: \"The first conversation I had with the guys [the club's hierarchy] was I want to assess the most important players, which are the ones who are here. Normally you get good surprises if you give people a chance.\n\n\"I had some really, really good surprises in the game against Charlton. Yes, we're in January, and yes, we want the club to be as successful as possible in the short term.\n\n\"But I also think sometimes the answers lie within the building and not outside. So I'll make a decision on that with the guys. Probably later in the week when I've seen everyone.\"\n\nChelsea are expected to make more significant signings in the summer, when their preferred targets are likely to be available.\n\nA high-quality attacker is high on the list of priorities as highlighted by Chelsea briefly checking the conditions to sign Antoine Semenyo before he joined Manchester City. Chelsea similarly considered a move for Dean Huijsen in the summer before his move to Real Madrid and will look at adding at centre-back.\n\nRennes defender Jeremy Jacquet is among those admired, while the Blues have been tracking Juventus forward Kenan Yildiz, although other unnamed options will also be considered. Chelsea have been linked with St Etienne striker Djylian N'Guessan, but he is a target for sister club Strasbourg in France.\n\nThey are also known admirers of Manchester United's Kobbie Mainoo, who has fewer than 18 months remaining on his contract at Old Trafford, with options in midfield to potentially be considered if Romeo Lavia continues to struggle with injury. Back-up goalkeeper Filip Jorgensen is currently assessing his options and would need replacing if he leaves.\n\nAcademy graduate Tyrique George has struggled to make recent matchday squads and is available for sale again after his £22m summer move to Fulham collapsed on deadline day. The option to leave on loan would also be considered.\n\nThe west London club remain under substantial restrictions from Uefa in January to maintain a \"positive transfer balance\" and must offset any incoming deals with outgoings.\n\nHowever, those restrictions will lift next season, coinciding with the Premier League introducing new Squad Cost Control ratio rules, which are less restrictive than the current Profit and Sustainability (PSR) regulations.\n\nChelsea have already lined up a host of players for next season, including £40m Sporting winger Geovany Quenda, Strasbourg striker Emanuel Emegha, Kairat forward Dastan Satapayev and Corinthians left-back Denner Evangelista. The Blues also recently completed a deal to sign defender Deinner Ordonez from Independiente del Valle to join in January 2028.\n\nOthers currently away on loan, like Aaron Anselmino at Borussia Dortmund and Strasbourg trio Mike Penders, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez, remain highly regarded, with the latter three having played for Rosenior in France.",

    "description": "Many Real Madrid fans are in shock at Alvaro Arbeloa's appointment as manager - is it a hasty move or a shrewd decision?",
    "fullText": "Real Madrid's decision to appoint Alvaro Arbeloa as head coach has been met largely with scepticism. Many supporters see the move as an unnecessary, premature risk rather than a bold, strategic appointment.\n\nOn the surface, the choice appears puzzling. Arbeloa lacks the glittering senior managerial CV you may expect a Real Madrid head coach to have.\n\nBut behind the initial reaction, the move reflects Real Madrid's prioritisation of identity and continuity, with those inside the club viewing it not as a gamble but as a calculated decision based on the loyalty of someone who has been part of Real for many years.\n\nIt is a philosophy that was made clear by Arbeloa himself at his unveiling.\n\n\"On Saturday I turn 43 and 20 of those years have been at this club. Every day I'm at the best club in the world,\" he said.\n\n\"This club is about winning, winning, and winning again. When I was a player, I learned those values from the people in that dressing room. They're still there, and that's what matters.\"\n\nHere we explore what Arbeloa might bring to the role, judging by his time behind the scenes coaching youth and reserve teams at Madrid and what he said at his first news conference. And we look at why there is still uncertainty over the club's long-term direction, despite the appointment.",

    "fullText": "Hop is a little frog with big dreams. He wants to explore life outside his forest, and his call to adventure is rewarded with the unexpected ability to leapfrog between worlds and even dimensions. Luckshot Games, the developer and publisher of Big Hops, appears to be similarly ambitious, if this game is any indication. Big Hops is a modest 3D platformer that takes on some of the biggest in the industry, on their own turf, with confidence and poise. Even when it very occasionally falls just short, you can't help but respect the pluck it took to aim so high. Big Hops is a game centered on joyous movement that should put Luckshot on players' radars going forward.\n\nFrom the very start, before Hop even leaves his homey little forest dwelling, you can sense Big Hops' inspirations. Hop's movement and (ahem) hops feel reminiscent of how Mario moves in Super Mario Odyssey, even including a belly slide that you can use to keep your forward momentum going. But on top of that, it layers in a few other elements. You can wall-run like in Prince of Persia or Titanfall. You can climb any wall a la Zelda: Breath of the Wild, complete with a stamina meter that determines how long you can cling to a surface. Your stretchy frog-tongue acts as a grapple to swing on hooks and grab handles, and it also makes it easy to grab things like bugs or fruits out of trees. It all feels so immediately natural, and part of the fun of Big Hops is learning how to connect your suite of movement options together.\n\nBefore long, Hop meets Diss, a strange extradimensional imp with a snarky attitude and questionable motivations. Diss spirits Hop away to The Void, a bridge between realms where gravity is strange and twisting upon itself. I couldn't help but be reminded of the flexible gravity system of Super Mario Galaxy, as Hop made a jump and suddenly landed upside-down with a changed perspective, but by this time the natural movement felt so smooth that the shift was easy to navigate.\n\nDiss tells Hop that he has to venture to various worlds to collect little globules of dark energy, which he calls Dark Drips, for reasons he refuses to explain. But in the very first world, Hop also finds a kindly mechanic who promises to build him an airship that will take him home if he gathers the correct parts. Diss tells him the Airship won't matter if he doesn't collect the Dark Drips, so Hop sets about doing both at once: collecting Dark Drips for Diss, while searching for Airship parts in the hopes he can circumvent being stuck in the imp's service. But Hop, who wanted more than anything to explore beyond his forest, finds that once he's out in the world, he just wants to get home to his family.\n\nEach of the three worlds you visit has its own individual peoples and its own story, usually revolving around culture clashes: a rabbit family business that isn't addressing a sinkhole that's alarming citizens, or an otter-run oil pumping operation suffers an acrimonious split between its founders. These are endearing fables that each end up feeling somewhat resolved, but not entirely. That seems like an intentional choice, to show how conflicts sometimes don't wrap up in a neat-and-tidy way. In what appears a less intentional choice, the overarching story with Diss and the Dark Drips speeds to a conclusion that loses the plot somewhat near the end, where I had trouble tracking exactly what was happening and why.\n\nAnd so you navigate each world, finding little droplets of void energy along main paths and hidden in secret nooks, while also completing major quests for Airship parts. Aside from a couple of boss fights, there aren't enemies to contend with, just platforming obstacles. Collecting a requisite number of Dark Drips lets you go to Diss and trade for trinkets that imbue you with extra abilities, such as reduced stamina requirements or friction on belly slides, compass indicators for various collectibles, shop discounts, and more. One even gives you total invincibility, permanently, at the cost of all of your trinket slots. It's an extremely flexible system that lets you approach the world as you'd like. I only wished there were loadouts to make it easier to swap between them quickly.\n\nAside from the Dark Drips, the worlds have lots of other little collectibles to grab. Coins scattered in pots and around hidden corners can be exchanged for cosmetic outfits and items such as stamina potions, which give you a one-time boost to your stamina. You can get the same boost by eating bugs you find around the world, which comes with a cute little science lesson identifying a bug the first time you catch it. There's even a shopkeeper who rewards you with unique items for finding lots of different species of bugs.\n\nBut the absolute best items are the various strange fruits and seeds you see growing on trees across the various worlds that can be utilized to aid your traversal. These power-ups start simply enough--an acorn picked from a tree and then tossed into the ground will quickly grow a towering vine that lets you climb up. But these only get more wild with subsequent fruits that you find, letting you summon bouncy bubbles, shift the gravity, explode certain walls, create a floating zero-G void zone, and more. And since you can grab these items and store them in your backpack for later, there aren't strict guardrails on how you can use them. The only limitation is that you need an object or surface to toss the fruit against to activate it, so you can't (for example) create an effect in mid-air. That slight limitation helps keep the mechanics in check, but for the most part you have total freedom. Often, Big Hops feels like you're breaking the game and finding your own way, only to realize that Luckshot gave you that degree of freedom on purpose, and often knew how you'd use it.\n\nThat makes it slightly more disappointing, though, when the game briefly gets overly restrictive. In the third world in particular, there's an extended segment with mine carts that feels slightly janky, and there is no obvious way to circumvent its more stringent requirements. It's a minor blemish, but it helps to illustrate that Big Hops is at its best when it's embracing freedom, and less successful when it feels, sometimes literally, on rails.\n\nFor a smaller game, though, Big Hops has impressive production values. Hop and Diss themselves are great character designs, and the worlds generally look very impressive and vibrant. Many of the characters are fully voiced, with great performances that lend life and personality to the characters. There are brief moments you can sense its limitations--most characters don't actually move and will instead just leave and then appear further down the path where you meet up with them, for example. But for the most part, its execution matches its ambitions.\n\nBig Hops is a testament to how much fun can be had with simple ideas done well. Hop has a modest suite of moves, finely tuned, that string together in ways to make movement feel free-flowing and exuberant. On top of that strong foundation, it layers on flexibility making the worlds you explore feel like playgrounds for your creative thinking and platforming finesse. Altogether, the result is a delightful platformer, and the first great game of 2026.",

    "description": "Kali...",
    "fullText": "His administration is hitting them with “discriminate harm.”\n\nElections have consequences—and they are, unfailingly, most profoundly visited upon Black women. Donald Trump’s reelection has had the consequence of Black women being pushed out of their workplaces at astonishing rates. Between February and July of last year, Black women lost 319,000 jobs in both the private and public sectors, driven largely by mass layoffs in education, healthcare, and housing. During that same period, white women gained 142,000 jobs, Hispanic women 176,000 jobs, and white men—wait for it!—picked up 365,000 jobs. In February, Black women’s unemployment rate stood at 5.4 percent, but that figure had soared to 6.7 percent by August. In September, the most recent snapshot available because of the shutdown, yet another 0.8 percent of Black women lost their jobs—while just 0.2 percent of white women suffered the same fate that month. All in all, according to the gender economist Katica Roy, roughly 600,000 Black women have been “economically sidelined” since February—which was, not coincidentally, this president’s first full month in office.\n\nThis has failed to set off alarm bells in a country that has never cared much about the well-being of Black women. Perhaps that’s why concerned policymakers and economists so often take such pains to emphasize that Black women’s economic distress is a bellwether for everyone else—to underline that their fates, and even their humanity, are connected to the nation’s in the hopes that the country might finally care. And it’s not just that racism and sexism make Black women the first to be let go when the economy stalls—it’s also that Black women power the economy in ways this country often refuses to acknowledge. Nearly 70 percent of Black mothers are the breadwinners in their homes, though they’re paid just 34, 44, or 52 cents of every dollar paid to Asian, white, or Black breadwinner dads, respectively. So when they lose jobs en masse, families are left financially vulnerable and local economies are weakened. Nationally, the cost has already surpassed $37 billion in lost GDP.\n\nBut it’s disingenuous to suggest that Black women are merely hit the hardest during economic slumps when, in fact, they’ve been targeted for harm by a right wing that is openly committed to undoing their progress. This country has—again—chosen to meet gender and racial advancement with aggressive rollbacks, including dismantling institutions that have provided Black women with financial security and career advancement. It’s not a coincidence that the first move of the Trump administration, in partnership with Elon Musk’s DOGE, was to vilify and hollow out the civil service—long an engine of Black middle-class stability—where Black women make up 12 percent of staffers, double their portion of the overall workforce. A National Women’s Law Center study found that women and people of color made up the majority of the workforce in the agencies that sustained the deepest cuts. The Department of Education, with a workforce of 28 percent Black women, lost 46 percent of its staff. The Department of Justice and the Department of Energy, both of which are about 70 percent white? Cut by just 1 percent and 13 percent, respectively, according to a ProPublica analysis.\n\nThe Trump administration has also made a show of pushing out high-profile Black women leaders, including Carla Hayden at the Library of Congress, Gwynne Wilcox at the National Labor Relations Board, and the ongoing effort to oust Lisa Cook at the Federal Reserve. Peggy Carr has described her abrupt dismissal after 35 years of climbing the ranks at the Department of Education as a “tragedy” both personal and professional. “It was like I was being taken out like the trash,” Carr told The New York Times of being escorted out of the building by a security guard, “the only difference is I was being taken out the front door rather than the back door.”\n\nThose public-sector layoffs have been accompanied by attacks on private-sector diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, or DEI. NPR reports that roles in DEI plummeted from 20,000 in 2023 to 17,500 in April 2025. Companies too numerous to name have hastily retreated from DEI efforts they had boasted about earlier, and not because they are mandated to, since Trump’s anti-DEI executive orders cannot overturn civil-rights laws or dictate the hiring practices of private businesses. A New York Times investigation found that the number of S&P 500 companies that include DEI language in their financial filings is down 60 percent since 2024. And for the first time since 2017, the majority of new directors hired at S&P 500 companies this year were white men.\n\nBlack women have long worked at rates higher than other American women, including as recently as 2024. But even in the best of times, intertwined sexism and anti-Black racism, or misogynoir, consign them to the most precarious jobs in the least recession-proof sectors. Across industries, they are paid less than white men with the same—and even, in some comparisons, lower—levels of education; are least likely of all women to be promoted; and leave college burdened with the most student-loan debt. Now Trump has launched what Representative Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) rightly calls a campaign of “discriminate harm” against them. History vividly illustrates what the consequences will be. After economic downturns in the early 1980s, the Great Recession of the aughts, and the Covid pandemic, Black women were the last to recover financially. But this time, the Trump administration has scrubbed race-based employment data from government websites—preemptively erasing evidence of the harms it’s inflicting.\n\nWhen Black women voted against this regime, they were fighting for their lives at the ballot box, knowing they’d be the first to bear the brunt of its damages—and fully aware they wouldn’t be the last. It was, of course, not enough to stop a country unwilling to heed their warnings. So once again we’re trapped, forced to inhale the noxious fumes no one else notices are poisoning us all.",

    "fullText": "Trump’s brazen violation of international law destabilizes global security.\n\nThe wisest condemnation of Donald Trump’s decision to send us troops to the sovereign nation of Venezuela to remove President Nicolás Maduro, as part of the administration’s plan to “run” Venezuela in collaboration with US oil companies, came 205 years before Trump announced his “Donroe” Doctrine.\n\nIn 1821, Secretary of State John Quincy Adams, who played an essential role in crafting the Monroe Doctrine—the foreign-policy position that he and others hoped would guard the Western Hemisphere against the threat of European colonial expansion—explicitly rejected military interventions for the purpose of regime change and economic conquest. “Wherever the standard of freedom and Independence has been or shall be unfurled, there will [America’s] heart, her benedictions and her prayers be,” Adams told Congress. “But she goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy.”\n\nEven where the United States might object to a foreign leader, Adams argued that the country must lead by example and with diplomacy, so that the fundamental maxims of US foreign policy would not change insensibly from liberty to force: “She well knows that by once enlisting under other banners than her own, were they even the banners of foreign independence, she would involve herself beyond the power of extrication, in all the wars of interest and intrigue, of individual avarice, envy, and ambition, which assume the colors and usurp the standard of freedom.”\n\nTrump, acting very much as a European king of old, attacked Venezuela as this edition of The Nation went to press. His move represents a brazen violation of international law that destabilizes global security and seizes Congress’s exclusive authority to declare war. Military force is justified only in response to a clear, credible, and imminent threat to  the security of the US or its treaty allies. Venezuela, whatever its internal dysfunctions or its connections to drug trafficking, poses no such threat.\n\nTrump’s scheming to forcibly determine the political leadership of another sovereign nation represents a grave departure from our best principles—as stated by Adams—and a return to the most discredited habits of American foreign policy. We are not naïve about American history. Throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, The Nation has decried presidential abuses of the Monroe Doctrine as a tool for the creation of corporate client states. But Trump’s self-styled Donroe Doctrine proposes a fresh bastardization of US foreign policy that is so extreme—and so dangerous—that it demands an urgent response from Democrats and those Republicans whose oath to the Constitution takes higher precedence than their loyalty to an authoritarian president and his fossil-fuel-industry donors.\n\nWhile Trump and his allies tried to justify naked aggression as part of a convoluted strategy to target “narco-terrorism,” Representative Pat Ryan (D-NY), a former Army intelligence officer who served two combat tours during the Iraq War, declared, “No matter what they say, it’s always oil.” Ryan was not alone in recognizing echoes of the WMD claims of former president George W. Bush, and how that blood-for-oil war went so horribly awry. In his first bid for the presidency, Trump positioned himself as something of an anti-war Republican. That was always a cynical gambit, and Trump is now exposed as an economic imperialist who learned nothing from Iraq and who is willing, as Representative Thomas Massie (R-KY) noted, to embark on a career of empire that risks the lives of US troops to make “oil companies (not Americans) more profitable.”\n\nNo one in their right mind believes that the madness—and danger—of Trump’s Donroe Doctrine will halt at the borders of Venezuela. His State Department declared on social media: “This is OUR Hemisphere, and President Trump will not allow our security to be threatened.” The American people see through the lies. A Reuters-Ipsos poll found that only 33 percent of Americans approve of the US military action to remove Maduro, while 72 percent worry about further US involvement in Venezuela.\n\nThis popular rejection of Trump’s territorial ambitions should inspire members of Congress to stand up to the administration—recognizing, as John Quincy Adams did, that if a president seeks to make America “the dictatress of the world,” this country will “be no longer the ruler of her own spirit.”",
