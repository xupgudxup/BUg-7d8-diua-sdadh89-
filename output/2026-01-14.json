    "description": "The latest news and notes around the Dallas Cowboys.",
    "fullText": "The Dallas Cowboys need DaRon Bland to be the best version of himself in 2026.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Cowboys CB DaRon Bland underwent successful surgery on his left foot in Indianapolis in a procedure done by Dr. David Porter.\n\nBland played 12 games for the Cowboys in 2025 before being placed on injured reserve for the final three games of the year. He also missed Weeks 2 and 3 of the season with a right foot injury that he suffered in practice.\n\nThe newest surgery marks the second straight year that Bland has had a procedure done on his left foot. In training camp leading into the 2024 season, Bland suffered a fracture in his left foot, which led to the first surgery. He would go on to return and play seven games that season for Dallas.\n\nEvidently, back-to-back seasons ending in surgery on the same foot is not what Cowboys owner/GM Jerry Jones or anyone wanted for Bland.\n\n“I’m not a doctor… but I don’t like that at all,” Jones said. “I don’t like the sound of that. You have to watch feet, relative to the future.”\n\nIn August, the Cowboys signed Bland to a four-year, $92 million extension, two years removed from an All-Pro season where Bland set the NFL record for most pick-sixes in a season with five in 2023.\n\nDespite two straight years of disappointing injury circumstances cutting Bland’s seasons short, Jones and the Cowboys do not regret signing Bland to his extension that keeps him in Dallas long term.\n\nFinding a replacement for Matt Eberflus won’t solve all the defensive problems from last season.\n\nWithin the first 10 minutes of the Dallas Cowboys’ season-ending news conference on Jan. 7, Jerry Jones addressed the two biggest reasons they had a second consecutive losing season for the first time in 23 years. As owner and general manager, no one is more responsible.\n\nThe first one, Jones brought up on his own: Trading Micah Parsons a week before the season started.\n\nThe second, Jones was asked about: Hiring Matt Eberflus as their defensive coordinator.\n\nThe two go hand-in-hand in what ended up being a group that allowed an NFL-high and franchise-record 511 points — almost exactly 30 points per game. They also gave up 377 yards per game, third-worst in the league.\n\nTo illustrate just how bad it was, look at what MVP candidate and New England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye did during the regular season: 4,394 passing yards, 31 touchdown passes, 8 interceptions, a 113.5 passer rating while completing 72 percent of his passes.\n\nOpposing quarterbacks against the Cowboys this season:\n\n“It wasn’t the year that we wanted,” defensive tackle Kenny Clark said. “That sucks. And we all got a hand in that. We all got to look at each other critically throughout the offseason and figure some stuff out.”\n\nIf the Cowboys nail their two first-round picks this year, the defense could be turned around in a heartbeat.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys’ season is over, and they have earned the 12th overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. The Green Bay Packers’ season is also over. They have earned the 20th overall pick in the draft, but that pick goes to the Cowboys thanks to the Micah Parsons trade. That gives Dallas the 12th and 20th picks in the draft. That’s a lot of first-round firepower.\n\nThe last time the Cowboys had two picks in the top 20 was in 2005. Some might remember that as the “defensive draft” as Bill Parcells and company loaded up on defenders. Six of the eight players they drafted that year played defense, with the two offensive guys being RB Marion Barber III (fourth round) and OT Rob Petitti (sixth round). The defensive players the Cowboys selected that year were:\n\nSome of those names should look familiar to you, as most of them hung around the league for a while. Five of those six players played at least nine seasons in the NFL. Three of them played at least eight seasons with the Cowboys. Two of them were All-Pro players with at least four Pro Bowls on their resume. And finally, one of them was a Hall of Fame edge rusher.\n\nThe Cowboys would love to come away with a similar haul. Oddly enough, the team’s draft picks line up similarly to where they were picking back in 2005. They have a top 12 pick, the 20th pick, no second rounder this year because of the Quinnen Williams trade, but then five picks on Day 3 outside the top 100.\n\nWhat is also similar about this is that the three top edge rushers in the draft are currently projected to go in the top 12 picks: Miami’s Rueben Bain, Texas Tech’s David Bailey, and Auburn’s Keldric Faulk. The Cowboys are in a great position to snag one of the best pass rushers coming out of the draft with their 12th overall pick. Expecting him to be a Hall of Famer is quite optimistic, but the chances of landing a top-talent edge rusher the year after losing Parsons are pretty decent. How nice would it be to have a top college edge opposite second-year edge Donovan Ezeiruaku while having guys like Williams, Kenny Clark, and Osa Odighizuwa filling the interior?\n\nThe ever-rotating door of head coaching vacancies could leave candidates out in the open, Dallas never thought would become available.\n\nOn Tuesday, Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin informed the team that he was stepping down as head coach. With the news, there will likely be a staff shake-up in Pittsburgh.\n\nThat opens up an option for the Cowboys, with a person familiar with the current staff.\n\nSteelers defensive backs coach Gerald Alexander is someone to keep in mind, as pointed out by Nick Harris of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.\n\n“With Mike Tomlin stepping down and the Steelers out of the playoffs, I’d be curious if Steelers [defensive backs] coach Gerald Alexander gets a look in Dallas for a potential spot on staff,” Harris wrote on X.\n\n“Played at Boise State when Klayton Adams was a [graduate assistant] and played with the Jets in 2011 under Brian Schottenheimer. Was Brian Flores’ [defensive backs] coach in Miami, too.”\n\nAlexander was a second-round pick of the Detroit Lions in the 2007 NFL Draft, also having stints with the Jacksonville Jaguars, Carolina Panthers, Miami Dolphins, and New York Jets before beginning his coaching career as a student assistant at Arkansas State. He continued coaching in the college ranks, before joining Flores’ Dolphins staff. He also served as a safeties coach for the Las Vegas Raiders, before returning to Pittsburgh for a second stint.\n\nIt is certainly a name to watch, especially with Flores being linked to the Cowboys’ defensive coordinator vacancy over the past few weeks. And, as we all know, the Cowboys need desperate help in the secondary, and Schottenheimer is a man who would love to bring in some familiarity.",

Moyes has a long-standing interest in the Moroccan, with former West Ham previously credited as admirers.\n\nFabrizio Romano is reporting that negotiations between the two clubs are underway. En-Nesyri has scored seven goals in 10 league starts for Fenerbahce this season after scoring 30 in all competitions last season.\n\nThe 28-year-old joined the Istanbul outfit from Sevilla, where he scored 73 times in 196 games, in a club-record €19.5m deal in July 2024. The transfer set a new Turkish transfer record at that time.\n\nAny deal will wait until the conclusion of the Africa Cup of Nations. En-Nesyri is currently with host nation Morocco at the tournament.

    "title": "Rudy Gobert, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Michael Porter Jr., Jaylen Brown among NBA surprises",
    "description": "Here are four players who have taken leaps in the first half of the 2025-26 season.",
    "fullText": "There have been plenty of nice developments through the first half of this NBA season. Jalen Johnson, Jalen Duren, Deni Avdija, Jamal Murray, and Chet Holmgren will probably make their first All-Star team. Plenty will be written about them in the future.\n\nDevelopment happens at all levels though. Sometimes those other improvements from players who are already great or those who fall just below the All-Star level fly more under-the-radar. Here are four examples of surprise players that haven't gotten quite as much attention as they might deserve, ranging from potential MVPs to my Most Improved Player of the first half.\n\nNBA POWER RANKINGS: Thunder's lead shrinks on the field\n\nFour years ago, when Alexander-Walker first played for Quin Snyder in Utah, he couldn't get consistent playing time. Even as a quality role player for the Wolves, he started only 30 of his 187 regular season games. In Atlanta, he's become one of Snyder's most reliable starters.\n\nAlexander-Walker carved out a role for himself earlier in his career as a defensive pest who could do a little bit of playmaking and shoot 3's. He averaged a modest 9.4 points per game last season and 8.6 for his career.\n\nNAW's offensive explosion up to 20.6 points per game this season is an 11.2 point increase from last year. That is significantly more than the 8.3 increase of his teammate and last year's Most Improved Player Dyson Daniels. It's somewhat mystifying then that NAW is rarely mentioned in the discussion for that award.\n\nNAW has become a dynamite driver to the left, using his weak hand to excel as one of the Hawks' primary playmakers. When he gets into the paint, his slithery-smooth finishes from everywhere on the floor are reminiscent of his cousin Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.\n\nBeautiful finish by NAW 😍 pic.twitter.com/wpNW4bII1b\n\n— Atlanta Hawks (@ATLHawks) January 10, 2026\n\nNobody could have expected this type of growth from Alexander-Walker. Well, almost nobody. Shai's father Vaughan Alexander trained both boys and always saw the potential in Nickeil, who was the better player growing up.\n\n\"Nickeil is going to be a star,\" Vaughan told me at the beginning of the year. \"Remember, I'm going to be the first to tell you that you're going to see that. You're going to say, 'Oh my God, he got so much better! Oh my God, he learned how to play!' No. That's been Nickeil from Day One.\"\n\nUncle Vaughan was right on that one.\n\nMORE: Hawks-Wizards Trae Young trade grades\n\nGobert has always had one of the ugliest offensive bags in the league. His lack of skill development on that side of the ball is one of the reasons why many considered him to be overrated during his prime.\n\nThose haters have to give Gobert credit. There are still some rough moments, but he has clearly put in work on that side of the ball. He's had some shocking highlight passes and buckets this season, showing real touch, skill, and shot creation that he didn't have in previous seasons.\n\nRUDY GOBERT ON HIS HEAD\n\n🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯 pic.twitter.com/dwf2Qk39KT\n\n— Minnesota Timberwolves (@Timberwolves) January 5, 2026\n\n\"He's been phenomenal,\" Anthony Edwards told Wolves reporter Dane Moore. \"His catching has gotten tremendous. It's crazy. He's catching everything now... Somebody like that I love to play with because he's willing to grow.\"\n\nGobert is an ultra-efficient offensive player. He had a streak earlier in the year of a franchise-record 18 consecutive makes, and he's leading the league with an absurd 71.7 percent field goal percentage. That's in addition to pulling down four offensive rebounds per game and setting great screens for teammates.\n\nGobert's value still comes primarily from defense, where he has quietly put together a season that should have him in contention for his fifth Defensive Player of the Year trophy. The offense has been a nice bonus, and it seems like everyone is sleeping on both his season and the Wolves as real title contenders.\n\nNobody expected Boston to be the No. 3 seed in the East halfway through the season. They've gotten there thanks to the No. 2 offense in the league. Jaylen Brown is the engine that is driving them to that surprising result.\n\nBrown is averaging career-highs in points per game (29.5), field goal percentage (49.5 percent), and assists per game (5.0). He's had some huge scoring outbursts, including a 50-point game against the Clippers. And his nine consecutive 30-point games in December tied Larry Bird's franchise record.\n\nBrown has been able to handle a much larger portion of the offense in large part because of how much more balanced his game has become. His left hand has been a weakness of his for many years. He's clearly worked on it, and coaches around the league are noticing.\n\n\"He used to be right-hand dominant. He's now using his left hand equally good as right,\" Raptors coach Darko Rajakovic told CLNS' Bobby Manning.\n\nThe other development that has made Brown harder to stop has been his increased reliance on his midrange shot. His 216 jumpers from between the free throw and 3-point line at the halfway point of the year are already more than the 144 that he took in all 63 of his games last season.\n\nThat's a tough shot to make a living on, but he's hitting a very solid 48 percent of them per Cleaning the Glass. That gives the Celtics an option late in the clock, and it also makes Brown a threat from anywhere on the floor.\n\nBrown has played his way into First Team All-NBA discussion. He should get a handful of MVP votes thrown his way at the end of the year.\n\nMichael Porter Jr. proved during his time in Denver that he was an elite shooter next to Nikola Jokic. How would that translate on a new team where he would have to create open looks for himself? He's answered that question resoundingly, averaging 26 points per game on great efficiency.\n\nPorter was a one-dimensional scorer in Denver who earned the nickname \"never swing the rock\" on social media platforms. He would oftentimes miss wide open teammates under the basket as he launched contested jumpers. That has changed too in Brooklyn, where he is shockingly fourth on the team in assists per game.\n\nPorter should be the most sought-after trade acquisition for any contender. He's proven he can play both on and off the ball for a championship-level team.",

    "fullText": "Brentford's visit to their local rivals on Saturday (3pm kick-off) is Rosenior's first game in the Stamford Bridge dugout, where he will undoubtedly be looking to get off to a winning start.\n\nChelsea are eighth in the Premier League going into Saturday’s west London derby. First of all, on the pitch, what have you made of what you’ve seen in the first half of the season?\n\nIt has been disappointing, in truth. There has not been any progress from last season, which is always disappointing to see.\n\nChelsea have been too inconsistent. They are able to get themselves up for the games against the likes of Arsenal, Liverpool and Barcelona, but have dropped too many points to sides they should be beating.\n\nOn New Year’s Day, Enzo Maresca left after 18 months in charge at Stamford Bridge. Relationships behind the scenes appeared fraught in the lead up to his departure, so did it come as a surprise, in any way?\n\nIn the end, it was not too much of a surprise, given how quickly Enzo Maresca’s relationship with the club deteriorated. But if you were to take it back a month before his departure, then it would come as a big shock.\n\nAs soon as Maresca came out with the “worst 48 hours” comment, it appeared to be the start of the end for the former head coach.\n\nLiam Rosenior has been appointed as the Italian’s successor on a deal running until the summer of 2032. What has the response been like to his arrival from Strasbourg?\n\nA lot of the Chelsea supporters were upset to see Maresca leave, and that has led to discontent over how the club is being run.\n\nThere does not seem to be a problem with Liam Rosenior, though, and supporters chanted his name after the win at Charlton Athletic in the FA Cup last weekend.\n\nHowever, he does face a big task - as any incoming Chelsea head coach does - of winning the supporters over.\n\n'Rosenior faces a big task - as any incoming Chelsea head coach does - of winning the supporters over'\n\nWhich player should Brentford be keeping an eye on on Saturday?\n\nLiam Delap has been in good form recently. It has been a slow start to life at Stamford Bridge for Chelsea’s new no.9 but, in recent matches, he has looked a lot sharper.\n\nHe has a history with Rosenior - having played under him during a loan spell at Hull in 2023/24 - which will help him.\n\nIf he starts on Saturday, then he could cause some problems for Brentford’s defenders. He is a real nuisance.\n\nWhat should Keith Andrews’ men expect from the Blues in terms of shape and style?\n\nNothing too dissimilar to how Maresca set up. Rosenior likes to play a 4-2-3-1 formation, but that shape quickly changes to almost a 3-2-2-3 when Chelsea have the ball.\n\nOne of the full-backs, usually the left-back, will advance up the pitch and slot into one of the no.10 roles.\n\nRosenior is trying to make the Blues more intense, but in terms of possession, he wants his side to be controlled and patient in their build-up.\n\nThere have been three draws and one Chelsea win in the last four meetings. What’s your score prediction this time around?\n\nBrentford are in really good form, so it will be tricky for Chelsea. This season, this type of game has proved difficult for the Blues.\n\nHowever, with it being Rosenior’s first league match, he will be desperate to get off to a good start. I expect Chelsea to win, but not comfortably.",

    "description": "With an injury sidelining a starter, Coach Ben Johnson trusts Theo Benedet to protect Caleb Williams' blindside.",
    "fullText": "The Chicago Bears have dealt with plenty of injuries this season to key players.\n\nBefore the regular season even started, the Bears were short at corner, as Kyler Gordon missed the first four games with a hamstring injury.\n\nGordon would return in Week 6, before going on the injured reserve with a calf injury ahead of Week 8. He tried to come back in Week 14 but suffered a groin injury in pregame warmups. He just came back from the IR for the Wild Card game with the Green Bay Packers.\n\nJaylon Johnson returned in Week 13 after dealing with a groin injury that had lingered since Week 2.\n\nThe offensive line has been fairly stable when it comes to injuries. The only issue was finding the right person to play left tackle.\n\nBraxton Jones started the year there, before being benched for Theo Benedet. Benedet was then unable to play in Week 12 against the Pittsburgh Steelers due to an injury, giving rookie Ozzy Trapilo his shot.\n\nAlso in that game, the Bears were down all three starting linebackers. D'Marco Jackson, Ruben Hyppolite and Amen Ogbongbemiga were the starters in the 31-28 win.\n\nTrapilo did well and had been the starting left tackle the rest of the season. The Bears are going to have to shift things around again after Trapilo suffered a season-ending patellar injury versus the Packers.\n\nBenedet played the rest of the game at left tackle, and head coach Ben Johnson was asked about how confident he was in him. Johnson knows that Benedet is capable of blocking Caleb Williams' blindside if needed.\n\nBenedet has plenty of experience as well, playing in 16 games with 577 offensive snaps.\n\n\"Yeah, I mean, you know, we've got tackles that have played a number of snaps over the course of the season, so your comfort level does go up,\" Johnson said. \"You know, there's a reason why Theo was out there, though. We felt really good about the ball that he was playing there in the second half of the season. So yeah, it's another one of those stories where it'll be next man up for us. We've had a number of those over the course of the year, and Theo, if it's his number that's called upon, he'll be ready to go.\"\n\nThe Bears have to feel good, even though losing Trapilo for the season is a heavy blow. However, having someone like Benedet, who has played a lot of snaps, has to be very comforting for Johnson.\n\nWilliams has been the third-fewest-sacked quarterback in the NFL this season, with 23 thus far. They will be tested, however, as the Rams have the seventh-most sacks (47) in the league.\n\nKickoff from Soldier Field will be at 5:30 p.m. CT on NBC.",

    "description": "The Montreal Canadiens played a great game in Washington for 40 minutes, and then the wheels fell off the wagon. While Samuel Montembeault put up a great fight, he just couldn't do it all on his own, and Montreal lost 3-2 in overtime.",
    "fullText": "After claiming a 6-3 win against the Vancouver Canucks on Monday night, the Montreal Canadiens were taking on the Washington Capitals on Tuesday night. Alexander Ovechkin and the Caps have had the Habs’ number of late, but without Tom Wilson, Jacob Chychrun, Justin Sourdif and Pierre-Luc Dubois, the locals came out flat, so to speak.\n\nOf course, the Caps still had Alexander Ovechkin, but the Great Eight is not as much of a threat without his proper supporting cast. Even on the power play, the sniper still just stands there waiting for the perfect feed, even though it’s clearly not coming. At times, the fans even booed their once-devastating man advantage. Still, thanks to a fantastic third frame, the Capitals came back from 0-2 to win 3-2 in overtime.\n\nEx-Canadiens First-Rounder Lands Extension With New Team\nCanadiens: Hutson Was “Grounded”\nCanadiens: It Wasn’t Perfect, But It Was Enough\n\nBrendan Gallagher has made the headlines recently, but not necessarily for the right reasons, as fans and media alike have started questioning whether he’ll remain in the lineup when the injured Habs are ready to return. In this game, however, he scored an important goal, not only because it gave the Canadiens a 2-0 lead, but because it was the 243rd of his career, which means he’s now tied with Mats Naslund for the 14th most goals scored while playing for the storied franchise.\n\nChose qu'on aime réentendre: «De Danault à Gallagher»\n\nSomething we'd like to hear again: \"From Danault to Gallagher\"#GoHabsGo pic.twitter.com/ZOjwjMUhOy\n\n— Canadiens Montréal (@CanadiensMTL) January 14, 2026\n\nOf course, Gallagher needed 881 matches to reach the milestone while Nastlund only needed 617 games, but still, for a fifth-round pick to have that kind of career with the same franchise is quite a feat. Gallagher has earned everything he has done in his career, nothing was ever given to him.\n\nIf there remained any doubts about whether Samuel Montembeault was fully back, they should have been eclipsed by his performance tonight. Flawless through 40 minutes after having made 17 saves, the Canadiens’ goaltender was put through a real test in the third as we faced 16 shots. While he did allow two goals, they were both nice deflected shots from Ethan Frank, and neither can be held against the Habs’ goaltender.\n\nMontyyyyy pic.twitter.com/nyumH0lUZB\n\n— Canadiens Montréal (@CanadiensMTL) January 14, 2026\n\nMontembeault's puck tracking and rebound control were on point, and he played a calm, collected game despite mounting pressure, especially late in the game. Without his heroics, the Caps wouldn’t have needed the overtime period to seal the deal. Washington added another 10 shots in the extra frame, and the goaltender stood tall as captain Nick Suzuki was stuck in the box, but with 39 seconds left, Connor McMichael called game.\n\nSince the game was the second part of a back-to-back, the Canadiens elected to give Kaiden Guhle a night off and to bring Jayden Struble back into the lineup. While the decision makes sense from a workload management standpoint for Guhle, it meant that Noah Dobson spent 28:37 on the ice and Mike Matheson 27:54. Meanwhile, Arber Xhekaj only saw 7:03 of action, the fact that he was in the penalty box for so long after getting 17 penalty minutes didn’t help his cause much, and Jayden Struble only played 9:43 after he looked a bit worse for wear following a hit.\n\nIn his first game in 13 days, Josh Anderson did well, scoring the Canadiens’ first goal as they were on the penalty kill.\n\nUn homme en moins, un cheval en plus 🐎\n\nGood to have you back, Andy!#GoHabsGo pic.twitter.com/DycYJydkiQ\n\n— Canadiens Montréal (@CanadiensMTL) January 14, 2026\n\nWhile the Canadiens leave Washington with a point, they could definitely have used two, and sooner rather than later, they may start regretting not having many regulation wins, since it's the first tiebreaker if points are tied.\n\nFollow Karine on X @KarineHains Bluesky @karinehains.bsky.social and Threads @karinehains.\n\nBookmark The Hockey News Canadiens' page for all the news and happenings around the Canadiens.\n\nJoin the discussion by signing up to the Canadiens' roundtable on The Hockey News.\n\ncom/free.

    "description": "Toronto had some pushback in the third period after Jarnkrok's goal, but couldn't find the back of the net again on the night.",
    "fullText": "The Toronto Maple Leafs were a tired bunch on Tuesday night in their 6-1 loss to the Utah Mammoth.\n\nIt was never going to be the easiest game for Toronto, given it was the second half of a back-to-back. What made it especially difficult, though, was the marathon they endured against the Colorado Avalanche the night before, which the Maple Leafs won in overtime.\n\nAuston Matthews played a team-high 25:29, four minutes more than William Nylander, who had the next most ice time among forwards. Four of Toronto's six defensemen played more than 20 minutes.\n\nOne storyline entering Tuesday's game was that Matias Maccelli was returning to Utah for the first time since being traded to Toronto in the offseason. Maccelli had the game-winner (and an assist) in his first game against his former club back in Toronto in early November.\n\n\"It's good to be back,\" Maccelli smiled before the game. \"Just try to focus on the game now, and then after the game, say hi to a couple of friends and go on.\"\n\nAnother (smaller) note was Calle Jarnkrok coming in for Nick Robertson, who's day-to-day with a lower-body injury after blocking a shot against the Avalanche.\n\nUtah erased any thought about those storylines quickly on Tuesday.\n\nThree minutes in, Michael Carcone beat Dennis Hildeby after a cross-ice pass by Mammoth defenseman Nate Schmidt. The play started after Nylander and Matthews had a miscommunication and gave up the puck in the neutral zone.\n\nfire drill goal against \n\nMatthews saved a goal beforehand, Hildeby was knocked over and lost his stick pic.twitter.com/7grrOUQ4gZ\n\n— Omar (@TicTacTOmar) January 14, 2026\n\nToronto pushed back quite a bit, but didn't get too many consistent chances. And even when they did earn opportunities, Karel Vejmelka came up big for the Mammoth.\n\nThe second period is when Utah really opened the game up.\n\nDylan Guenther scored back-to-back goals in under a minute and a half, which included a rocket of a shot that beat Dennis Hildeby over the shoulder. Given Hildeby's size (standing at 6-foot-7), he'd definitely like to have that one back.\n\nDylan Guenther doubles the lead\n\nwhat a shot pic.twitter.com/QspMvUpjJt\n\n— Omar (@TicTacTOmar) January 14, 2026\n\nLater in the period, whilst it was 3-0 for the Mammoth, JJ Peterka threw the puck on net from the half wall, which beat a screened Hildeby to put Utah up 4-0.\n\nCalle Jarnkrok, however, did get the Maple Leafs on the board in the third period. He put in a rebound off an Oliver Ekman-Larsson point shot for his sixth goal of the season. But that would be all Toronto could muster up as they lost their first game in regulation since Dec. 21 (11 games ago), a 5-1 loss to the Dallas Stars.\n\nCalle Jarnkrok gets the Leafs on the board 🚨 pic.twitter.com/igpajVIDSM\n\n— Omar (@TicTacTOmar) January 14, 2026\n\nUtah added two more goals late in the third period. Hildeby finished the game, allowing six goals on 40 shots. It's the second time Hildeby has allowed six goals in a game this season.\n\nYou can't take very much from this game on the Maple Leafs' side. Utah, like Toronto, is on the bubble of a playoff spot, and was desperate for a win. Tie that together with the Maple Leafs arriving in Utah early Tuesday morning following their game against the Avalanche — it's honestly a recipe for disaster.\n\nUnless Toronto's opponent is playing as tired as they are, this game was a scheduled loss for the Maple Leafs.\n\nDon't put too much stock into this game. The biggest positive I'd say was seeing Toronto push back in the third period following Jarnkrok's goal. It's pleasant to see the Maple Leafs continue to fight back in what was likely a difficult game — physically and mentally.\n\nNext stop: Vegas for a reunion with Mitch Marner and the Golden Knights.",

    "fullText": "#5 Purdue 15-1 (5-0) will host Iowa 12-4 (2-3) on Wednesday night.\n\nPurdue is off to a clean start in the Big Ten. Ben McCollum’s first year at Iowa has hit a recent speed bump after a hot start to the season. Iowa has lost its last two games, dropping a game at Minnesota and then at home against Illinois.\n\nNow Matt Painter and Ben McCollum will square off for the first time. McCollum took over the Iowa program this season from long time head coach Fran McCaffrey. Now McCollum will get his first look at Mackey Arena.\n\nIt’s all about the point guard matchup with All-American and best point guard in the country, Braden Smith, squaring off against the sweet shooting sensation and possible All-American, Bennet Stirtz.\n\nStirtz is a more shoot first point guard, but he does plenty to entertain the crowd. Stirtz is one of the nation’s most unapologetic launchers of the basketball. He will consume any space with his ability to get the ball up and in the rim. He’s averaging 17.6 points a game while shooting just under 40% from three on about six attempts per game. He can score off the dribble, standing still, getting to the hoop, stepping back, or from very far distances.\n\nBraden Smith is the returning point guard of the year and All-Time assists leader in the Big Ten. Smith is closing in on the All-Time NCAA assists record next. After a 14 assist performance against Penn State, Smith is on pace to break the record just a couple games into the post season for Purdue. Smith is also leading the nation in assists per game.\n\nIt’s unlikely the two will be directly against each other by choice on the court, but there is no doubt the two teams run through their very talented point guards.\n\nIt doesn’t get much more entertaining a viewing experience than watching Smith and Stirtz duel.\n\nThis will be an important game for Purdue in its race to reclaim the Big Ten. It’s gotten off to its best start in school history, including a 5-0 start in Big Ten play, but now Purdue will have to go on the road for four of the next five games including games at USC, UCLA, and Indiana.\n\nPurdue’s first five games in conference have lacked much drama. Purdue’s made chum out of the bottom and middle of the Big Ten to this point. Now it starts to get fellow heavy weights and rivals while straying away from the comforts of Mackey Arena.\n\nPurdue comes into the game as the 12th best three point shooting team in the country, making 39.3% of its attempts. Iowa is holding teams to 30.2% from three, a top fifty mark in the country. Iowa will and does focus on limiting attempts from the perimeter and tries to not leave shooters.\n\nBraden Smith is the nation’s best creator of open threes, for himself, and his team full of shooters. Iowa will have its hands full, but Purdue also doesn’t tend to force things through team’s strengths. \n\nIowa has struggled to defend inside, giving up a nearly 51% field goal percentage on two-pointers. That could mean that the big men inside, Oscar Cluff, Daniel Jacobsen, and most likely, Trey Kaufman-Renn will get chances early and often against Iowa’s defense.\n\nAround Stirtz, balance and length make Iowa tough\n\nThere is not a true second on Iowa’s team when it comes to offense. Instead, balanced scoring, with good shooting from multiple positions help the offense percolate around Stirtz’ incredible shot making.\n\nAlvaro Folgueiras and Cooper Koch’s are plus 40% stretch forwards that provide Stirtz spacing and pick and pop targets in the half court. Kael Combs is Iowa’s secondary playmaker, but Iowa’s offense runs through Stirtz. It will live and die as Stirtz plays and how he can elevate the squad around him. \n\nMcCollum was picked for Iowa in part because of his pedigree on defense and the defensive unit he built at Drake. He’ll now gets to test his defensive acumen against the offense that’s ran roughshod through the league the last decade.\n\nIt will be a very fun coaching matchup between McCollum and Matt Painter.",

    "fullText": "Golf course architect Brandon Johnson, a longtime design protégé of Arnold Palmer, has completed an extensive renovation to King’s North. The layout was originally designed by Palmer and opened in 1973 at Myrtle Beach National in South Carolina.\n\nKing's North is open for play now, and the club plans a March 2 grand reopening celebration for the layout that was ranked by Golfweek's Best as the No. 18 public-access course in the state before the renovation and is likely to climb.\n\nThe work to King’s North was completed in two phases, with the renovations to the front nine in 2024 and the back nine in 2025. Fairway corridors were restored, and vegetation was removed in areas to expose long views across a property that boasts no residential encroachment. Greens and surrounds were reimagined, with the putting surfaces expanded and reshaped.\n\nThe work to the bunkers and exposed sand, with a focus on a more rugged and natural aesthetic while remaining playable, is beautiful. Some hazards were relocated, and the strategic intent was boosted at what has been one of the most popular golf courses in Myrtle Beach for decades.\n\n“Golfers who have played King’s North before are going to be blown away by how different it plays,” Johnson, who worked as an associate for Palmer Design for 17 years and now leads Brandon Johnson Golf Course Design, said in a media release. “This wasn’t about small tweaks. We leaned into bold ideas – restoring width, creating new angles and building green complexes that reward creativity and thought. Every hole now asks a question.\n\n“The course has greater depth now. The more you play it, the more you will appreciate what’s there. ... If Mr. Palmer were standing on the first tee today, I think he’d recognize the soul of the course and be proud of how far it’s been pushed.”\n\nKing’s North is operated by Founders Group International, which owns 21 Myrtle Beach-area courses. King’s North is one of three courses at Myrtle Beach National, along with the West Course and SouthCreek.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Golfweek: Extensive renovation wrapped up at popular South Carolina golf course",

    "fullText": "During Tuesday's episode of \"Up & Adams,\" hosted by Kay Adams, former Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith discussed Kansas City's coaching changes. After Adams mentioned that the former top overall pick's name was a potential replacement for offensive coordinator Matt Nagy, he immediately took himself out of the running.\n\n\"No way,\" Smith said with a smile. \"No. It's so hard, my kids. I got 14, 12, 9. You take that job, it's like 'see you in five years.' You know, it's hard, I love Matt (Nagy), that's my guy, I love Matt, but no.\"\n\nAlex Smith shuts the door on taking the Chiefs OC job with reports that Matt Nagy is \"expected to leave\"...\n\nAnd looks for Andy Reid to bring in familiar face Mike Kafka 👀@heykayadams pic.twitter.com/6H1yq6Tbg9\n\n— Up & Adams (@UpAndAdamsShow) January 13, 2026\n\nSmith shared some insight into how head coach Andy Reid handles his coaching staff.\n\n\"Andy (Reid) just rarely brings somebody out of his circle, said Smith. \"I don't think it's a bad thing if he did, but i think in some ways (Mike) Kafka fits that so perfectly, he just spent four or five years with (Brian) Daboll in that system, but obviously he knows that Chiefs system so well, i think he can bring in some outside ideas.\"\n\nKafka spent the last few seasons as the offensive coordinator for the New York Giants, but finished 2025 as the interim head coach after Daboll was fired mid-season. Smith also reminded the public how play-calling duties are handled on Reid's coaching staff.\n\n\"Andy is doing the offense we all know that, and Andy knows it,\" said Smith, \"When you're the offensive coordinator, you only have so much input.\"\n\nThe Chiefs will likely be looking to part ways with Nagy, as he's been a hot name in interviews with multiple teams in recent days.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Former Chiefs QB Alex Smith addresses possible OC job candidacy",

    "description": "After a 1-3 roadtrip, the Devils head home to face the Kraken",
    "fullText": "The Matchup: Seattle Kraken (21-15-8) @ New Jersey Devils (23-21-2)\n\nThe Broadcast: MSGSN, Devils Hockey Radio\n\nOn Monday night, the Devils defeated the Minnesota Wild 5-2. After a disastrous start to their road trip, which saw the Devils lost the first 3 games in a row, the Devils were able to close out the trip with a victory. The win was their 1st in their last 5 games, and only their 3rd in their last 11 games.\n\nJacob Markstrom got the start and gave the Devils a chance to win (or as I like to call it, he did his job), only letting up 2 goals. It helped that on the same night, the offense decided to do their job for once too. I would assume that Keefe goes back to Jake Allen for the game tonight, as Markstrom has not started in back to back games since 12/3 and 12/5. However, at this point in the season, crazier things have happened, so we shall have to wait and see.\n\nDawson Mercer got the Devils on the board at 10:07 of the 1st period to give the good guys a 1-0 lead heading into the 2nd period. Ryan Hartman tied it up for the Wild at 13:41 of the 2nd, before Ondrej Palat scored with 8 seconds left in the period to give the Devils back the lead at 2-1. I assure you, I double checked it. It’s correct. Palat did in fact score a goal. His 3rd of the season. I can’t believe it either.\n\nJesper “Wait…I don’t HAVE to pass every time I have the puck?” Bratt scored not once, but twice…less than a minute apart in the 3rd period to put the Devils up 4-1. Dougie “I’m confused, do you guys want me or no?” Hamilton had assists on both Bratt goals. In a sure sign that hell is about to freeze over, Palat scored his second goal of the game at 9:39 of the 3rd. Yes folks, Palat matched his goal total, for the entire season so far, in one game. Marcus Foligno added a meaningless PP goal at 19:41 of the 3rd and the Devils won 5-2.\n\nOn Monday, the Kraken defeated our hated rivals, the New York Rangers by a score of 4-2. Mika Zibanejad and Sam Carrick gave the rich New Yorkers who pretend to be actual hockey fans, but real hockey fans can’t afford tickets at MSG, so the arena is filled with these people instead Rangers faithful false hope with a 2-1 lead after the 1st period. However, the Kraken would go on to score 2 goals in the 2nd period and 2 \n\nPhillip Grubauer started in net against the Rangers on Monday. Considering that he hasn’t started back to back games since 11/13 and 11/15, I would expect Joe Daccord to get the start in net tonight against the Devils. Their game tonight against the Devils is their 3rd game of a 5 game road trip.\n\nIn news which I still find hard to believe, the Devils actually have a healthy roster at the moment. I don’t want to jinx it, so I will not say it out loud, but I believe typing it out is safe. With the win, it is probably safe to assume that Hamilton will stay in the lineup tonight and that Nemec is back to being one of the players on the short list of those that are held accountable. However, it’s possible that the Devils are trying to shop Hamilton, so who knows if and when that happens (a trade) or if and when Nemec gets back into the lineup. As of this writing, I’d expect to see Hamilton play tonight, but we shall see what news comes out before the game tonight.\n\nGrimace was very pleased to see a win last night. For his mental sanity though, he’s still choosing to stay on his self induced break from predictions for now. His apologies.\n\nGrimace’s 2025-2026 Season Prediction record currently stands at 12-10-0.\n\nIt was great to see the Devils get a win in their last game against Minnesota. It was a much needed win, at a minimum, to break the losing streak and the seemingly endless cycle of negativity. I am still of the view though, that it was 1 game. When they start winning, more than they lose, then I will start to have some more confidence. I am confident in this though. With everything that has been going on lately with this team, if the Devils come out flat tonight and/or play a stinker on the level of the 9-0 Islanders game, the home crowd is going to get absolutely brutal.

    "title": "My NFL awards ballot, from MVP Drake Maye to All-Pro Jalen Pitre",
    "description": "The PWFA All-Pro teams and NFL awards will be announced after the Divisional Round. Here's who I voted for.",
    "fullText": "The 2025 NFL season isn't quite in the books. But with the regular season finished, we can begin our postmortem.\n\nThat starts with league awards. As a member of the Pro Football Writers of America (PWFA), I get to cast my vote for everything from NFL MVP to All-Pro teams to digging deep to find a rookie center who made a hefty contribution (spoiler: there really wasn't one this year). This isn't the Associated Press vote, which has already been tallied and All-Pro teams have been announced. It's the PFWA version, which will roll out across a five-day stretch beginning January 19.\n\nSo, as is tradition, let's talk about who I voted for.\n\nThis was the two-man race everyone made it out to be. Maye won more games, generated one of the biggest turnarounds in NFL history and was an absolute runaway winner when it came to advanced stats. Matthew Stafford played a tougher schedule, was an absolute juggernaut at times and led the league in traditional stats.\n\nUltimately, Maye elevated his teammates more. As Bill Barnwell points out, three different Patriot wideouts ranked in the top-six when it came to catch rate over expected this fall. Either that's because Stefon Diggs (sure), Mack Hollins and Kayshon Boutte (eh....) are singular presences and some of the best receivers in the league. Or, it's because the guy throwing them the ball is putting it in places where they can make a play that other quarterbacks can't. Factor in Maye's scrambling ability and the drop-off in supporting cast between he and Stafford and, yep, that's my QB1.\n\nThis was a fierce battle between Smith-Njigba and division rival Puka Nacua. Smith-Njigba had more receiving yards, more yards per target and a slightly higher degree of difficulty via average target depth (11.3 to 9.4). Nacua had more catches, more yards per route run (3.73 to 3.61… no other qualified wideout was higher than 2.7) and a better catch rate.\n\nUltimately, JSN got the call because of what he meant to Seattle’s passing game. There was no Davante Adams to buttress him. This is a man who faced brackets throughout 2025 because teams weren’t afraid of anyone else in the Seattle passing game. Even as Sam Darnold faded he knew the easiest solution to his problems was winging the ball to his all-world wideout. That added degree of difficulty tipped the scale in the Seahawk’s favor.\n\nSchwesinger was an easy choice. No rookie shares the overall impact he had on the game, even if it meant toiling for a Cleveland defense that had to do a ton of heavy lifting.\n\nMcMillan was trickier. Tyler Shough's ability to adjust as games wore on and lead a depleted Saints offense to respectability made him a viable candidate, but he only made nine starts. Jaxson Dart and Cam Ward managed bursts of excitement against below-average play thanks to a lack of above-average veterans around them. Emeka Egbuka and Tyler Warren both faded with their teams' postseason hopes down the stretch.\n\nMcMillan, however, was a rising tide for an inconsistent Bryce Young. His ability to beat bracketed coverage to find space OR haul in contested catches through traffic made him an asset and was the difference between Carolina winning the NFC South or spending another year as an also-ran. Leading all rookies in receiving yards and receiving touchdowns didn't hurt, either.\n\nFrom missing nine games due to injury and a spot on the trading block to 100 catches and a positive influence on two different young quarterbacks. Olave proved his value in 2025.\n\nWilliams' slow starts are a concern, but he showcased his ability to rise to the moment and make the Bears a legitimate Super Bowl contender. That was more impressive than breakthrough years for Smith-Njigba, Maye, George Pickens, Will Anderson Jr., Javonte Williams or a handful of other viable candidates.\n\nLike running back, there are so many deserving candidates and so few spots. With apologies to Mike Macdonald, Mike Vrabel, Ben Johnson, DeMeco Ryans, Kyle Shanahan and Sean Payton, Coen's in-season adjustments to make a flawed Jacksonville team an absolute wagon down the stretch — maximizing Trevor Lawrence's strengths and stapling together a top-three defense over the last half of the season — made him my huckleberry.\n\nFrom 4-13 to 14-3 thanks to Maye's improvements and massive contributions from new arrivals in both free agency and the draft. That'll do it.\n\nKubiak has Seattle's defense playing like a furious swarm of bees at all times.\n\nNow, on to my first-team All-Pro picks. I'll break out a few selections I debated internally.\n\nQuarterback: Drake Maye, New England Patriots\n\nRunning Back: Bijan Robinson, Atlanta Falcons and Jonathan Taylor, Indianapolis Colts\n\nTailback is a position with two available slots and at least five worthy candidates. It hurt to leave Christian McCaffrey off the list, but his below-average running — minus-166 rushing yards over expected (RYOE) were worst in the NFL — was enough to elevate Taylor to the first team. While the Colts' star faded down the stretch he was also hamstrung by declining quarterback play that shrank head coach Shane Steichen's playbook.\n\nWide Receiver: Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Seattle Seahawks and Puka Nacua, Los Angeles Rams\n\nTight End: Trey McBride, Arizona Cardinals\n\nCenter: Aaron Brewer, Miami Dolphins\n\nGuard: Quinn Meinerz, Denver Broncos and Joe Thuney, Chicago Bears\n\nOffensive Tackle: Garrett Bolles, Denver Broncos and Darnell Wright, Chicago Bears\n\nDefensive End: Myles Garrett, Cleveland Browns and Will Anderson Jr., Houston Texans\n\nLet's talk about Anderson over Detroit Lions star Aidan Hutchinson.\n\nHutchinson led the NFL in pressures (89) and ranked fourth in sacks (14.5). But Anderson had 85 pressures in nearly 140 fewer pass rushing snaps. His 19.5 percent pressure rate was higher than any other full-time pass rusher but Micah Parsons (who got a first-team nod at outside linebacker despite missing the tail end of the season with a torn ACL) and Nik Bonitto (who made it at the other OLB slot).\n\nOn the other hand, Anderson got to clean up some of the chaos sewn by Danielle Hunter. Hutchinson got 11 sacks from rotational rusher Al-Quadin Muhammad, but no other Detroit Lion had more than six quarterback hits. A tough call, for sure. Anderson’s ability to do a little more with less made him the response to a question without a wrong answer.\n\nDefensive Tackle: Jeffery Simmons, Tennessee Titans and Zach Allen, Denver Broncos\n\nWith apologies to Cam Heyward, who is 37 years old and still logged more snaps in 2025 than any other interior lineman, as well as Jordan Davis and Derrick Brown (who is a 3-4 end but still fits the bill).\n\nOutside Linebacker: Micah Parsons, Green Bay Packers and Nik Bonitto, Denver Broncos\n\nInside/Middle Linebacker: Ernest Jones, Seattle Seahawks\n\nWant to hear something I hate? The PFWA has two slots for outside linebackers — ostensibly your edge rushers from the second level — but only one slot for an inside linebacker. That’s one honor for a field that includes Jordyn Brooks, Devin Lloyd, Jack Campbell and Carson Schwesinger. No matter how you fill this out, you’ll be left with a *bunch* of snubs.\n\nJones got a little credit for being the center of gravity behind the league’s top defense — though that could be overstating his skill because he was surrounded by demons in Seattle’s not-yet-determined level of hell. He was a stalwart in coverage, logging five interceptions and recording a passer rating equal to Derek Stingley’s (see below). While he didn’t offer much as a pass rusher (only 25 blitzing snaps), his run-stuffing presence and low missed tackle rate made him a reliable, set-it-and-forget-it presence in the middle of the field.\n\nCornerback: Derek Stingley Jr., Houston Texans and Quinyon Mitchell, Philadelphia Eagles\n\nI wanted to go with an unheralded name here. Did you know Donte Jackson yielded the second-lowest passer rating among full-time cornerbacks this fall? That Joey Porter Jr. allowed only five yards per target? That Tre’Davious White turned back the clock with his best season since 2020?\n\nBut, nope, Stingley and Mitchell were too overwhelming when it came to the eye test and in their numbers. Stingley allowed a 54.0 passer rating. On 43 percent of the targets thrown his way were caught. Both numbers led all full-time cornerbacks. Mitchell was one of the most-targeted cornerbacks in the NFL despite holding opponents to a 44 percent completion rate for testing him.\n\nThere was plenty of good defensive back play in 2025. Stingley and Mitchell, however, were the elite gliding over the good.\n\nSafety: Jalen Pitre, Houston Texans and Derwin James, Los Angeles Chargers\n\nNeither one of these guys is a pure over the top centerfielder. Both find ways to inject havoc into almost every drive. Pitre had four interceptions without allowing a touchdown in 58 targets this season, averaging -0.6 expected points added (EPA) per coverage play. James played at least 100 snaps lined up deep, in the slot, at linebacker or on the line of scrimmage and still finished with a 53.4 passer rating allowed, two sacks and three interceptions. The league is so much better when he's healthy.\n\nPlacekicker: Will Reichard, Minnesota Vikings\n\nPunter: Daniel Whelan, Green Bay Packers\n\nKickoff Returner: Ray Davis, Buffalo Bills\n\nPunt Returner: Chimere Dike, Tennessee Titans\n\nSpecial Teamer: Brevyn Spann-Ford, Dallas Cowboys\n\nIf a tight end finishes his season with more than a tackle per game, he's doing something right on special teams. Spann-Ford is a name you hear at Cowboys games more often than his nine catches in 2025 suggests.\n\nThat's all for now. I'll have my all-rookie team picks tomorrow.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: My NFL awards ballot, from MVP Drake Maye to All-Pro Jalen Pitre",

    "fullText": "The ultimate goal for every football player who laces up their cleats is to reach the NFL. That dream narrows quickly after high school, and even for those talented enough to play at the collegiate level, the odds of landing on a professional roster remain slim. But unlike several other sports, football requires a massive number of bodies to function, and scouts flock to end‑of‑season showcases for one reason: finding a diamond in the rough.\n\nTexas A&M has several players projected to come off the board within the first two days of the 2026 NFL Draft. For those athletes, skipping an All‑Star event might be the smart play. For others, these games represent a final opportunity to get in front of evaluators who could ultimately pound the table for them in draft rooms this spring.\n\nTaurean York has been a constant in Aggieland, staying through the coaching transition and emerging as the heartbeat of the defense. His football IQ, leadership, and command of the unit will be difficult to replace, but he played a major role in preparing the next wave of linebackers to take the reins. While he doesn’t boast prototypical size or elite speed, he consistently puts himself in a position to make plays and elevate those around him.\n\nAfter a historic junior season, York has officially declared for the 2026 NFL Draft and accepted an invitation to the East‑West Shrine Bowl. It’s a chance to showcase his instincts, intelligence, and competitiveness in front of NFL scouts one more time as he looks to solidify his place at the next level.\n\nInvitation Accepted@AggieFootball LB Taurean York (@TaureanYork5x) is locked in for the East-West Shrine Bowl! 👍#GigEm | #ShrineBowlWHOSNEXT 😎 pic.twitter.com/bOPLsOGjYv\n\n— East-West Shrine Bowl (@ShrineBowl) January 12, 2026\n\nThe 2026 East-West Shrine Bowl kicks off January 27 at Ford Center at The Star in Frisco, Texas\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes, and opinions.

    "fullText": "Jiri Prochazka is such a man of honor that he doesn’t want an award if he doesn’t think he deserved it, and he definitely doesn’t think he deserves the UFC’s ‘Comeback of the Year’ award for 2025.\n\nThat’s because according to Prochazka, his fight with Khalil Rountree Jr. at UFC 320 went exactly according to plan. Which is a bit shocking to those of us that watched it live, because it seemed like Rountree was rinsing the Czech fighter for the first two rounds before “BJP” turned the tides and earned a big KO win late in the third.\n\nIt was a huge moment for Prochazka and an exciting one for fans. Jiri banked $100,000 off the moment, half from a Performance of the Night bonus, and half from a Fight of the Night bonus. We don’t believe there’s any bonus money given away to UFC’s ‘of the year’ winners, but either way Prochazka says he doesn’t want that win to be considered a comeback.\n\n🙏\nAppreciate it and one more thing.\nIt was not comeback. \nI watched that 2 days back, and here is my result. \nI controlled my opponent all the fight.\nEven if he was many time successful with his techniques, I controlled distance, rhythm and precision of hits.\nNow is time to make… https://t.co/TRBzgNpXj8\n\n— Jiri BJP Prochazka (@jiri_bjp) January 13, 2026\n\n“Appreciate it and one more thing, It was not comeback,” Prochazka declared on X (formerly Twitter). “I watched that 2 days back, and here is my result. I controlled my opponent all the fight. Even if he was many time successful with his techniques, I controlled distance, rhythm and precision of hits.”\n\nDid he, though? As the included highlight video from the UFC shows, Rountree was landing more than Prochazka, was frustrating him, and disrupting his attacks. All three judges at UFC 320 gave the American kickboxer the first two rounds. And then we know what happened in the third.\n\n#UFC320 Official Scorecard: Jiří Procházka (@Jiri_bjp) vs Khalil Rountree Jr.\n\nComplete Scorecards ➡️ https://t.co/WnF6GEQktj pic.twitter.com/1zxBEzYqED\n\n— UFC News (@UFCNews) October 5, 2025\n\nRather than question his performance in those first two rounds, Jiri wants to look forward to his next fight. That may be in April depending on if the UFC can convince him to potentially miss the birth of his first child to fight in a non-title fight at UFC 327 in Miami. Or perhaps the rumors are true about Alex Pereira moving up to heavyweight to challenge for an interim title, clearing the way for “The Czech Samurai” to get what he demanded for such a sacrifice: a shot at UFC gold.\n\nProchazka recently clarified that reports of him fighting in Miami against Carlos Ulberg were premature and that negotiations were ongoing. Days after that, though, he posted a training video with the caption “Preparation started.”\n\nHe finished his rebuttal of the UFC’s Comeback of the Year with another message that makes it sound like he’s fighting sooner than later.\n\n“Now is time to make a step up and show it,” he wrote. “LETSGOFORTHAT!”",

    "description": "While Notre Dame might not have the numbers with transfer commits, it’s still a great class. Here are a few thoughts on the Irish and the portal.",
    "fullText": "At this point, with Notre Dame having seven transfer portal commits, the picture for 2026 and beyond has become much clearer.\n\nThe portal is always going to be madness, but to navigate it the way that the Irish did was fantastic especially considering the new rules. The window will be open until Friday, as there was a 2-day dead period mixed into the two weeks of action.\n\nHead coach Marcus Freeman will speak later this afternoon, and we’ll find out some answers about Notre Dame going forward. In the meantime, here are three thoughts that I have on the Irish and the 2026 transfer portal.\n\nPer @247Sports Notre Dame now has the No. 1 overall recruiting/transfer portal class.\n\nShopping down a different aisle from the Brian Kelly era. pic.twitter.com/KBX2RUxhas\n\n— Brad Powers (@BradPowers7) January 13, 2026\n\nMarcus Freeman has somehow elevated recruiting at all levels again, something that is hard to do considering how well the high school classes have been. In the graphic above, Notre Dame will have the most talented group of players entering the program in 2026. IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY!\n\nTo understand Notre Dame's portal shift this cycle (and that the school backed football to do it), consider in the previous five off-seasons. \n\nNotre Dame took 29 transfers; 27 were one-year grad-transfers.\n\nThis year, seven transfers (so far). Six have multi-year eligibility.\n\n— Pete Sampson (@PeteSampson_) January 14, 2026\n\nFor the most player, Notre Dame would only take graduate transfers, but that changed during this cycle. Almost all of them will have the chance to be on campus for multiple seasons, setting up a much larger window of success. A lot of that depends on what CJ Carr ends up doing as well, but Freeman hasn’t had any quarterback issues starting with Sam Hartman in 2023, followed by Riley Leonard and now Carr.\n\nIt’s interesting to see that the Irish are giving transfers more leeway by not being graduate students, and this could end up being a huge change within the program. A really good one too.\n\nMarcus Freeman in the portal after having his entire legacy questioned because he missed “Nick Marsh” and “lan Strong” pic.twitter.com/mOzktLEXkJ\n\n— The Domerlorian ☘️ (@jaredsla) January 14, 2026\n\nSure, it was frustrating to watch, but at this point I don’t think that anyone is going to complain about the results. Multiple former 5-star prospects, stealing wide receivers away from Ohio State, addressing all the perceived needs with room to star, it was everything you hoped that Notre Dame would do. You have to tip your cap to Freeman, as he surely didn’t panic at all during the first week of “missing” targets. The Irish had a massive haul and there could be more additions to the group as well.\n\nContact/Follow us @IrishWireND on X (Formerly Twitter), and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Notre Dame news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fighting Irish Wire: Three thoughts on Notre Dame football’s 2026 transfer portal success",

    "fullText": "According to SPORT, Barcelona youngster Pedro ‘Dro’ Fernández did not train in the session prior to the match against Racing Santander and will not travel to Santander for the Copa del Rey tie.\n\nThe 18-year-old midfielder will be unavailable and will not join the squad after it was confirmed that he is carrying physical discomfort that prevents him from competing at full capacity.\n\nThe coaching staff have chosen not to take risks and, pending official confirmation, everything indicates that he will not be included in the matchday squad.\n\nDro’s absence represents a significant setback for Hansi Flick, as everything suggested that he could have been given minutes in tomorrow’s game in the Copa del Rey Round of 16.\n\nIn fact, the Spain Under-18 national team had released the La Masia graduate from the squad, aware of his discomfort. Although there was confidence that he would recover in time, this has ultimately not been the case.\n\nDro out of Copa del Rey clash. (Photo by David Ramos/Getty Images)\n\nDro will now remain in Barcelona throughout the week and focus on a full recovery before returning to the group as soon as possible.\n\nThe objective is for him to be available again in the coming weeks and to resume his normal routine, putting behind him a physical issue that has arrived at the worst possible moment.\n\nBarcelona have been working for some time on renewing Dro’s contract. The player is held in very high regard internally due to his projection and performances.\n\nThe teenager has made a strong impression on Flick since pre-season, with the coach satisfied by his attitude and his fit within the playing model.\n\nWith Dro turning 18 years old earlier this month, Barcelona plan to follow the same strategy that they did with Lamine Yamal and Pau Cubarsi and tie down the academy ace to a new long-term contract at the earliest possible.",

The fourth official will be Andrew Kitchen.\n\nUnlike in all of the previous rounds, there is VAR in use for the semi-finals, as all of the games in this round take place in Premier League stadiums where the VAR system has already been set up.\n\nAs a result, Jarred Gillett will be on VAR, with Timothy Wood assisting. With Liverpool already having been eliminated from the League Cup, perhaps this is a good time for self-confessed Liverpool fan Gillett to get an Arsenal game.\n\nArsenal’s record with Hooper refereeing is largely positive, with the Gunners winning 10, drawing two, and losing two of their matches with the referee in charge. Though it’s notable that both defeats were in the League Cup.\n\nHooper has never awarded a red card to Arsenal or their opponents, nor a penalty, so his matches involving the Gunners have largely been uncontroversial.\n\nThe only previous time he refereed a game between Chelsea and Arsenal was a 5-0 win for the Gunners in 2024.\n\nAny fans expecting a good game can only hope Hooper does a better job at managing it than Anthony Taylor did during Arsenal’s previous trip to Stamford Bridge.",

    "fullText": "Amateur player Jordan Smith would have been \"happy winning just one point\" - but walked away with A$1m and bragging rights over world number two Jannik Sinner as he triumphed at the Australian Open's Million Dollar One Point Slam.\n\nThe innovative format offered amateur players the opportunity to win the prize money by playing a sole point against some of the sport's top talent and other famous faces.\n\nSmith was the star of the show on Rod Laver Arena, also defeating women's world number four Amanda Anisimova in front of 10,000 people.\n\nSmith faced women's world number 117 Joanna Garland in a fitting finale, after the Taiwanese 24-year-old stunned men's world number three Alexander Zverev and former Wimbledon finalist Nick Kyrgios.\n\nNew South Wales state champion Smith was not the only amateur to seize his moment in the spotlight, with Queensland state champion Alec Reverente beating men's world number seven Felix Auger-Aliassime.\n\nAs the two best performing amateurs, Smith and Reverente also went head-to-head to win a brand new car, with Reverente triumphing.\n\nThe tournament was played in good spirits - even a racquet smash by Kyrgios following his defeat was performed in good humour - and generated genuine intrigue.\n\nMany of the beaten players, including men's number one Carlos Alcaraz, remained at Rod Laver Arena and gathered around televisions to watch the conclusion between the two unlikely finalists.\n\nOfner loses in Melbourne after celebrating early\n\nThe opening match set the tone for the evening when tennis coach Andres Schneiter knocked out men's world number 34 Corentin Moutet.\n\nThe upsets kept on coming across the quick-fire format as fellow players offered enthusiastic support from the side of the court and the crowd rallied behind the underdogs.\n\nGarland, who was beaten in the first round of singles qualifying in Melbourne, appeared more stunned than anyone as she beat former women's world number three Maria Sakkari and 2024 Wimbledon semi-finalist Donna Vekic.\n\nSmith, meanwhile, did not need to hit a ball against Sinner after the men's world number two failed to land his serve – with professionals only granted one opportunity to get it right.\n\nHe was not done there, following up victory over Anisimova by beating 71st-ranked Spaniard Pedro Martinez to set up his shot at the prize money.\n\n\"Coming into tonight I would have been happy winning just one point,\" said Smith.\n\n\"I was so nervous but enjoyed being out here, it was a great experience.\"\n\nElsewhere, Sakkari ended Alcaraz's bid after the top-ranked men's player netted an attempted drop shot.\n\nMeanwhile six-time major winner Iga Swiatek saw off the men's world number 22 and 31 in Flavio Cobolli and Frances Tiafoe respectively before losing to Martinez.\n\nThe event, held four days before the Australian Open starts on Sunday, featured a total of 48 competitors, including 24 top professionals.\n\nEight amateur winners of state championship rounds, eight players who qualified in Melbourne, and another eight wildcards – including celebrities and invited personalities - made up the rest of the competition.\n\nBeginning with a game of 'rock, paper, scissors' to decide who serves, each match consisted of a single point, with the winner progressing in a knockout format.\n\nThe Australian Open held its inaugural One Point Slam event in 2025, but the prize fund was A$60,000 (£29,400) and Russia's Andrey Rublev was the only top-10 player involved.\n\nIt is the latest attempt by tennis authorities to attract new interest in the sport after the US Open introduced a standalone mixed doubles championship before the main draw last year.\n\nLive scores, results and order of play\n\nGet tennis news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Perfect Game released its preseason All-America teams and three players from LSU baseball were recognized. Outfielder Derek Curiel earned a first-team nod. Relief pitchers Casan Evans and Zac Cowan landed on the second and third teams, respectively.\n\nCuriel, entering his sophomore season, comes into 2026 as the reigning freshman of the year from multiple outlets. He batted lead off for much of the season and led the team with a .345 batting average and 20 doubles. He finished in the top three with 90 hits, 67 runs, and 55 RBI.\n\nAs a true freshman, Evans earned a critical role coming out of the bullpen. The right-hander finished the season with a 2.05 ERA and seven saves in 19 appearances. Over 52.2 innings, he recorded 71 strikeouts to 19 walks. Evans also made three starts and posted a 5-1 record.\n\nCowan ended the season as a first-team All-SEC selection. He worked a 2.94 ERA and 60 strikeouts in 22 appearances. For a portion of the 2025 season, he led the SEC and country with a sub 2.00 ERA. Five of his six saves came in SEC regular-season games.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LSU Wire: Three LSU baseball stars earn preseason All-American nods",

    "fullText": "Safe to say, this Roshn Saudi League season has been incredibly difficult for Al Shabab.\n\nA fourth straight defeat last time out, albeit at high-flying Al Taawoun, saw the 2011-12 champions slip into the relegation zone as the 2025-26 campaign edges closer to the halfway mark.\n\nCan the capital club turn it around? History suggests they can, with Al Fateh escaping a similarly precarious position last year. However, to do so, Al Shabab need to straighten a few things out.\n\nHere are five areas they need to improve to save their season, starting with Wednesday’s Matchweek 15 encounter at home to NEOM Sports Club.\n\nIt’s been a nightmare week on the disciplinary front with four red cards in their past two games, against Al Fateh and Al Taawoun.\n\nIt’s hard enough to win a game with 11 men, and then 10, but it’s almost impossible with nine, as Al Shabab have been reduced to in recent matches.\n\nWith another sending off coming against Al Ahli back in October when, admirably, they rescued a point after going down to 10 men, they share the dubious honour of receiving the most red cards this season, alongside Damac.\n\nNot only does it make life difficult in-game, but also in the following matches when key players are forced to sit out. For sure, Al Shabab must curb their on-pitch disciplinary issues.\n\nAl Shabab are far from the worst defensive team this season having conceded only 20 times. Indeed, it’s the best record of any side in the bottom half - but it could also be so much better.\n\nNot only have they given away the most reds this season, but they’ve also conceded the highest amount of penalties, with six. Furthermore, Imanol Alguacil’s side have kept a mere two clean sheets, their last coming all the way back in Matchweek 3 against Al Fayha.\n\nDespite that, they actually boast one of the best records when it comes to shots faced - they rank fifth in the league - with only heavy-hitters Al Nassr, Al Ahli, Al Hilal and Al Ittihad having faced fewer.\n\nIf Al Shabab can tighten up and stop giving away penalties, that defensive solidity can be a base from which to build.\n\nPenalties aside, Al Shabab’s issue isn’t necessarily conceding goals, it’s scoring them. With nine goals through 13 games, they have the equal-worst scoring record, together with Al Okhdood.\n\nInteresting, they fare OK for total shots, with 151 being middle of the road compared to other teams. However, their shot conversion of six percent constitutes the worst in the league. Also, their shooting accuracy, at 39.8, percent represents the third worst.\n\nWith that, Al Shabab possess the biggest differential in the league between goals scored (9) and xG (14.9), with a difference of -5.9.\n\nIn the absence of Abderrazak Hamdallah, second in the all-time RSL scoring charts but who this term has made four league appearances and thus has one goal to his name, there’s been a lack of alternatives to step forward and fill the void.\n\nSo, Alguacil will look to the likes of Yannick Carrasco, Unai Hernandez, Abdullah Matouq (now suspended) and Josh Brownhill to step up. And for Hamdallah, fresh from helping Morocco capture the 2025 FIFA Arab Cup, to get a protected run of games.\n\nPossession for possession’s sake isn’t the answer, but it’s also true that, if you have the ball, the opposition cannot score. And, put simply, Al Shabab don’t have the ball often enough.\n\nAlguacil's side rank as one of the lowest for average possession and sit third last in terms of total passes and second last for accuracy (they no doubt miss reigning RSL Young Player of the Year, Musab Al Juwayr, now at Al Qadsiah).\n\nWith elite talent such as Brownhill, Carrasco, Yacine Adli and Vincent Sierro, Al Shabab's ability on the ball isn’t in question. Yet perhaps their tactics and approach need tweaking to give themselves a chance to stamp their authority on games.\n\nIt’s self-evident, but what Al Shabab need more than anything is to win a game of football. Their only victory this season came in Matchweek 2 against Al Hazem, and since then it’s been months of woe.\n\nIt’s impossible to quantify with stats and numbers, but the morale boost from simply gaining three points from a match cannot be overstated.\n\nJust look at Al Fateh, both last season and this, and how a win or two (or five…) on the bounce can suddenly flip your fortunes. Triumph, and it alters the team dynamic, not to mention the overall mood around the club.\n\nFor sure, Al Shabab will be far from a happy place to be right now. Still, if they can get the monkey off their back and get back on a winning track, beginning at home to NEOM SC, things can turn around quickly. That’ll be the hope, at least.",

    "description": "DJ Turner should be given a long-term contract this off-season.",
    "fullText": "With the offseason here, it’s time to take a look at some of the Cincinnati Bengals biggest extension candidates.\n\nDalton Risner has stated on multiple occasions his desire to remain a Cincinnati Bengal. He has been a rock-steady lineman in Denver, Minnesota, and Cincinnati. His ability to play at a high level at either right or left guard over the years is admirable. Risner finished the season as PFF’s 29th graded pass blocking offensive guard out of 137 of them with at least 20% of the required snaps.\n\nThe Bengals haven’t had a guard finish that high in quite some time. His final pass blocking grade was 71.0 on the season. Risner also finished 38th out of 137 as a run blocker, with a grade of 68.2 on the season. The offensive line as a whole performed much better during the 2025 season.\n\nWhy would the Bengals want to mess with that chemistry?\n\n\"This is where I want to be. I want to play for this organization. I want to be a Cincinnati Bengal.\"\n\nDalton Risner says he doesn't want to get to free agency. He wants to play another season in Cincinnati. pic.twitter.com/4gbLzp53WQ\n\n— Joe Danneman (@FOX19Joe) January 5, 2026\n\nOssai is scheduled to hit the free agent market once again this year. He does not turn 26 years old until April. When you draft and develop young talent, you need to do everything you can to re-sign it. The biggest question for Ossai is going to be just how high is that price tag this year? The Bengals landed a bargain by getting a starter in Ossai for just one-year $6.5 million dollars last year. I am not expecting that number to be near that low this year. With the likely departure of Trey Hendrickson, Ossai seems like more of a priority to retain.\n\nTurner was snubbed from making the Pro Bowl this past season. He finished just one behind the leaders in passes defensed in 2025, recording 18 of them on the season. Turner also finished top 5 for his coverage grade in the NFL for cornerbacks with at least 50% of the snaps. Turner came in at number five, finishing the year with a 78.1 PFF coverage grade. Turner will be entering the final year of his contract. It makes a ton of sense to try and work on an extension this off-season. If the Bengals want to show some growth with how they do things, getting Turner locked into a long-term deal would be a good start.\n\nDJ Turner with great awareness to leave Metcalf and force the incomplete pass to Smith pic.twitter.com/7WEIOsTB0u\n\n— Bengals & Brews (@BengalsBrews) October 17, 2025\n\nHill has settled in nicely at outside cornerback opposite of Turner. He will be entering his fifth-year option season in 2026 for the Cincinnati Bengals. Locking up both outside cornerbacks with long-term contracts would be quite the statement. This would allow the Bengals to shift focus to finding at least one safety and some other pieces on their defense for the next few seasons. Hill finished the season with 88 tackles, 1 interception, and 11 passes defensed.\n\nMurphy will be getting his fifth-year option picked up this year. That will put him here for at least the next two seasons. Since he is under contract for two more seasons, he is not nearly as pressing to get signed yet. However, if he continues his upward trajectory, he is only going to get more expensive to re-sign. Trying to lock him into a reasonable four-year contract extension wouldn’t be the worst idea in the world. He was highly impressive this year for the Bengals as both a run defender and showed improvement as a pass rusher. He finished the season with a team-leading 5.5 sacks on the year.\n\nMyles Murphy vs. Miami Dolphins pic.twitter.com/CUxMsqtVxv\n\n— Bengals & Brews (@BengalsBrews) December 22, 2025",

    "fullText": "Alvaro Arbeloa’s first steps on the Real Madrid senior bench are being closely analysed, and early indications suggest that one recurring tactical solution from the past is set to be abandoned.\n\nAccording to a recent report from MARCA, it is highly improbable that Federico Valverde will continue to be used at right-back under the new coach.\n\nThis decision is influenced by several factors, starting with the player himself.\n\nNotably, Valverde has never been comfortable operating in that role, despite performing it with professionalism whenever required.\n\nWith the dressing room still in a sensitive state following recent upheaval, Arbeloa’s priority is expected to be restoring calm and balance rather than forcing key players into uncomfortable positions.\n\nAsking Valverde to continue filling in at right-back would go against that objective.\n\nArbeloa’s coaching identity also plays an important role in this approach.\n\nDavid Jimenez could be an option for Arbeloa. (Photo by Florencia Tan Jun/Getty Images)\n\nKnown for his strong belief in youth development, the former defender has consistently shown a willingness to trust academy players when senior options are either unavailable or not fully suited to a role.\n\nIn that context, relying on Valverde as a defensive stopgap makes less sense, especially when the Uruguayan’s best qualities are maximised elsewhere on the pitch.\n\nArbeloa is expected to prioritise using Valverde where he can make the biggest impact, rather than as a positional compromise.\n\nAs such, Arbeloa’s background points towards a selection strategy rooted in continuity rather than improvisation.\n\nOne name gaining attention is David Jimenez, as Arbeloa has worked closely with him in the youth setup, and trusting a familiar profile at right-back would align with his philosophy.\n\nImportantly, this shift is also influenced by availability. With Dani Carvajal back and fit, the need to experiment with Valverde at right-back is significantly reduced.\n\nRather than a sweeping overhaul, Arbeloa’s early decisions are expected to reflect subtle but meaningful changes.",

    "fullText": "The FC Barcelona coach, Hansi Flick, appeared at the press conference ahead of the league match against Racing de Santander.\n\nThe German manager took the opportunity to update the status of the squad and, above all, to give the green light to one of the most eagerly awaited returns or debuts for the Barça fans: the presence of Joao Cancelo on the pitch.\n\nFlick was straightforward in confirming that the Portuguese full-back is ready to have an immediate impact. “Tomorrow Cancelo could play a few minutes. That’s something we have in mind against Racing,” stated the coach.\n\nWith these words, any doubts about the wing-back’s physical condition are dispelled, as he is set to become a key piece in the offensive scheme that the coaching staff aims to implement in the upcoming matches.\n\nRegarding the qualities the Portuguese international brings, Flick was full of praise, highlighting his ability to unsettle opponents in the attacking half.\n\nAccording to the coach, they were looking for a profile that would offer an extra dose of creativity: “Joao is fantastic and can give us a lot, also in attack, in the final third to get past the opponent.” This versatility from Cancelo allows the team to gain depth and tactical options that had been lacking until now.\n\nBeyond Barça’s current affairs, the press conference was marked by the recent departure of Xabi Alonso from Real Madrid. Flick, far from entering into controversy, showed his professional respect for the Basque coach.\n\n“It’s football, it’s not my business. I can only say that I have a good relationship with Xabi. We met in Leverkusen and have stayed in touch,” explained the German, downplaying the media noise surrounding the eternal rival.\n\nFinally, the Barça coach wanted to wish Alonso luck in his new professional stage, predicting that it won’t be long before he returns to elite coaching. “He’s a great coach with a promising future and I’m sure he’ll soon have a good project,” he concluded.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "description": "Luis Aparicio is sent to Baltimore … and yet the South Siders win the trade",
    "fullText": "1960 \nChuck Comiskey made it public that White Sox owner Bill Veeck (in poor health and needing to sell the club) has turned down his offer to purchase the team. Comiskey’s backers include Chicago businessman William Bartholomay and entertainer Danny Thomas. Veeck will eventually sell to Arthur Allyn.\n\n1963 \nIt was the move that re-energized the franchise and led directly to back-to-back-to-back seasons of more than 90 wins in 1963, 1964 and 1965. White Sox GM Ed Short traded shortstop Luis Aparicio and outfielder Al Smith to the Orioles for third baseman Pete Ward, outfielder Dave Nicholson, shortstop Ron Hansen and relief pitcher Hoyt Wilhelm.\n\nTrading Aparicio was a shock, but contractual differences between him and the team and the bad feelings it produced made a deal necessary. He was so disappointed to be traded, he put a curse on the White Sox as he left town.\n\nWard supplied power for the next few seasons: In 1963 and 1964 he averaged 22 home runs, 89 RBIs and hit .290 before a accident (in which he was a passenger in a car leaving Chicago Stadium after a hockey game) severely impacted his career. He suffered whiplash and never felt comfortable at the plate ever again.\n\nNicholson, who struck out far too much, still managed 22 home runs and 70 RBIs in 1963. Hansen would become one of the best defensive shortstops in the league, and hit as many as 20 home runs in a season at a time when shortstops simply didn’t do that.\n\nWilhelm became the top relief pitcher of the 1960s. In his six years with the Sox, he won 41 games and saved 99 others while producing some astonishingly low ERAs considering he threw a knuckleball. His highest ERA between 1963 and 1968 was 2.64, and in every other season it was less than two. He became a Hall-of-Famer in 1985.\n\nIn a separate transaction on this same day, the White Sox sold the O’s pitcher Dean Stone, who would appear in 17 games for Balti\n\n1997 \nThirteen years after shipping him off to the Yankees as a thrown-in to a trade for … Roy Smalley, the White Sox attempted to right past wrongs and signed Doug Drabek to a one-year, $1.3 million deal. The 34-year-old was coming off of two poor seasons in Houston, but wasn’t being looked at as anything but a lesser rotation arm. Drabek struggled even to deliver lesser-grade pitching, however, being gifted a 12-11 record in spite of a 5.74 ERA, thanks to a prodigious Chicago offense. His 0.4 WAR (presumably mostly grounded in sheer workload (31 starts/169 1⁄3 innings) did represent the last positive measure of his career, as in 1998 Drabek moved to Baltimore and flushed out of baseball with a -1.4 WAR.\n\nAll told, by swapping away Drabek carelessly, the White Sox missed out on 21.2 WAR through his 20s, which included a Cy Young win. (Think having him on that 1990 upstart club, given he went 22-6 with a 2.76 ERA and Cy, would have helped the White Sox catch Oakland for the AL West crown?)\n\n2001 \nThe White Sox acquired pitcher David Wells from Toronto, basically for pitcher Mike Sirotka. It was the second trade made with Toronto over nine weeks (Glover-Eyre trade, Nov. 7, 2000).\n\nOver the coming weeks and months, Sirotka and the Blue Jays claimed the Sox knew that he had a bad arm and couldn’t pitch. Sox GM Ken Williams defended himself by saying that he told the Jays he thought Sirotka might be hurt and offered pitcher Jim Parque instead. Commissioner Bud Selig ruled in late March that the trade would stand. The whole episode became known as “Shouldergate.”\n\nWells, meanwhile, had few good moments with the Sox. He won on Opening Day in Cleveland after he said that fans in the stands got him angry by talking about his mother and how he was raised. But after that, because of a bad back, Wells barely pitched, winning only five games in 16 starts for the year.\n\nHe then caused a major controversy when he went on the radio and said that he didn’t think first baseman Frank Thomas was as badly hurt as he claimed. Thomas would play only 20 games that year after he tore a tricep muscle diving for a ground ball along the first-base line.",

    "description": "Fly half Russell will pull the strings for Bath in their crunch Champions Cup clash but won’t get any favours from his international teammates lining up for Edinburgh",
    "fullText": "Finn Russell expects his Scotland teammates to come in with late hits and other nefarious tactics to “wind him up” when Bath host Edinburgh in their decisive Investec Champions Cup pool clash this weekend.\n\nBath welcome Edinburgh to the Rec on Friday evening in what is essentially a straight shootout for top spot in Pool 2, which would guarantee home games in the knockout rounds all the way until the semi-final.\n\nRussell, who began his career at Edinburgh’s bitter rivals Glasgow Warriors before moving to French side Racing 92 in 2018 and then to Bath five years later, will likely be pulling the strings at No 10 for the English side.\n\nMeanwhile, the Edinburgh squad is full of players he will be lining up alongside in three weeks’ time when Scotland travel to Rome to face Italy in their Six Nations opener, which the 33-year-old admits adds an extra layer of bragging rights to Friday’s contest.\n\n“I got a little bit off the Edinburgh players when we played them last season,” explained Russell. “It’s all good fun and all part of the game.\n\n“I played against Edinburgh a lot of times when I was at Glasgow and I’ve played with a lot of their players with Scotland. I know these boys from camp so well.\n\n“It’s always good fun playing against boys you know because there’s always bragging rights before the Six Nations. If they win or we win, we wind each other up. Hopefully we’ll get the win on Friday night. If not it’ll be quite a rough [Six Nations] camp.\n\n“I imagine there will be a couple of late shots, getting held on the ground - that kind of stuff, which is always the case against players you know.”\n\nRussell said he had already messaged star Edinburgh winger Duhan van der Merwe, warning him to expect a tough night, but knows that the Scottish side will prove a real challenge for high-flying Bath.\n\n“I’m not sure what the weather will be like but if it’s like it is now there’ll be a lot of balls going up in the air,” added Russell. “I’ve already texted Duhan to tell him to be ready.\n\n“Edinburgh will be coming down with everything to play for. They have had a great campaign in the Champions Cup so far. It’s going to be a big challenge for us and we know what’s coming. Hopefully we’ll do the job on Friday night and we’ve got bit of a plan for them.\n\n“This game could help us get a home play-off, so it’s not a knockout game but it’s one we want to win so we can put our best foot forward in the next round of the competition.”\n\nRussell led Bath to their first Prem title for almost 30 years last term, as well as the European Challenge Cup crown, but he’s eager for them to make waves in the top-tier European competition this time around.\n\nThe Blue, Black and Whites are going well domestically once more, sitting second in the Prem, although the fly half admits their has been a transition in switching from the highly-regarded Lee Blackett – who left to join the England coaching set-up – to Martin Gleeson as attack coach.\n\n“Since the November Tests we’ve spoken more about playing more expansively like we used to do last year and the year before,” Russell explained. “Lee and Glees have different views about how we can run an attack shape so we’ve been figuring out how we can adjust and what works best for people.\n\n“In the last few games we’ve gone slightly wider off 10. We have probably had more joy with that, focusing a little bit more on multi-phase and trying to take teams apart like that.”\n\n“With the forwards we’ve got why wouldn’t you use pick and go’s though. They’re so good at that. It’s definitely a strength of ours but as backs we’re looking to try and be more expansive as well. It’s about getting the balance right.”",

    "fullText": "The New York high school boys basketball 2025-26 campaign is heating up around the Empire State as the drive towards the postseason officially begins.\n\nTaking back over the No. 1 spot in our latest New York high school boys basketball rankings are the \nArchbishop Stepinac Crusaders, which are off to a 9-4 start playing against some of the best competition in the country. Top two teams are both Crusaders, but who else should we watch for out of New York when it comes to the state’s top high school boys basketball teams?\n\nThe Massey Ratings, officially used during the BCS era, is a model that ranks sports teams by analyzing game outcomes, strength of schedule, and margin of victory.\n\nHere’s a way-too-early look at the top 25 teams in the country according to the Massey Ratings, which ranks teams by analyzing game outcomes, strength of schedule and margin of victory, as of Jan. 14.\n\nIf you take one look at the roster Archbishop Stepinac (9-4) and you’ll easily see why the Crusaders are near the head of the table in New York. This season, the Crusaders bring back a very senior-laden bunch and super talented in the front and back court. Senior four-star shooting guard Jasiah Jervis returns after averaging a team-high 16.2 points per game last season. The Crusaders will be tough to drive to the rim on as they have a pair of USC commits in 7-footers in Adonis and Darius Ratliff, respectively. Fordham commitment Hassan Koureissi pairs up with Jervis to create one of the best guard combos in the Northeast. This Saturday, Archbishop Stepanic will be taking on one of the top programs in the country in Notre Dame (Calif.).\n\nOne of New York’s top high school boys basketball teams is the Long Island Lutheran Crusaders (5-5) as they feature one of the best overall rosters in the country once again. Though the Crusaders dropped their fifth game of the season recently to CIA Bella Vista Prep, they have played elite competition thus far. What is obvious when taking a look at the talent pool the Crusaders possesses, this team can compete with practically anyone in the nation. Long Island Lutheran has multiple five-star talents in senior 6-foot-5 point guard Dylan Mingo and junior 6-foot-8 forward Moussa Kamissoko. Among other players folks need to have their eyes on that lace ’em up for the Crusaders are Cincinnati commitment Kayden Allen and North Texas pledge TJ Crumble. Long Island Lutheran will be facing Compass Prep (Ariz.) and Montverde Academy (Fla.) at the Hoophall Classic in Massachusetts.\n\nThe St. Francis Preparatory School Terriers (10-2) have continued with their winning ways as they return one of the more talented teams in the New York City region. Key players returning for the Terriers begins with Oesoemana Sacko, who is already committed to Fairfield University, and 6-foot-3 sophomore Justin DeSena. The Terriers’ only two losses on the season have come against Colorado’s No. 1 ranked Ralston Valley and No. 3 Christ The King Regional, respectively.\n\nOne of the top teams out of New York high school boys basketball is Christ The King Regional (9-2), which finished with a 16-14 record last year. The Lions bring back a talented lineup, which includes 2028 three-star point guard Skye Ragoo, who has an offer currently from St. John’s. Playing one of the tougher schedules in the state, Christ the King Regional has already notched some impressive wins, including recently over No. 5 St. Francis Prep. The Lions’ latest game, though, was a 76-66 loss to No. 18 ranked Xaverian (N.Y.).\n\nThe Nazareth Kingsmen (10-5) of Brooklyn enter the Top 5 of our latest New York high school boys basketball rankings this week as this group has really come on hot as of late. Of Nazareth’s losses this season, two of them have come against Archbishop Molloy, but the Kingsmen were able to notch their first victory versus the Stanners. A matchup against No. 2 Archbishop Stepinac last Saturday ended in a 83-61 loss for the Kingsmen as they look to bounce back tonight against No. 3 ranked St. Francis Prep.\n\n6. Cardinal Hayes Cardinals (6-4)\n7. Iona Preparatory School Gaels (8-6) \n8. Thomas Jefferson Campus Orange Wave (7-5) \n9. St. Raymond For Boys Ravens (5-7)\n10. Poly Prep Blue Devils (1-1)\n\n11. Albany Academy Cadets (2-1)\n12. Archbishop Molloy Stanners (10-6) \n13. Lawrence Woodmere Academy Tigers (0-0)\n14. Christian Brothers Academy Brothers (7-0)\n15. St. John’s Prep Red Storm (5-0)\n\n16. Fairport Red Raiders (7-0)\n17. Xaverian Clippers (6-3)\n18. Westhill Warriors (9-1)\n19. South Shore Vikings (7-5)\n20. Shaker Bison (8-2)\n\n21. Msgr Scanlan Crusaders (8-4) \n22. Chaminade Flyers (6-4) \n23. Canarsie Wolfpack (9-4) \n24. Mount Vernon (5-2)\n25. Shenendehowa Plainsmen (8-1)\n\nFor New York high school boys basketball fans looking to keep up with scores around the nation, staying updated on the action is now easier than ever with the Rivals High School Scoreboard. This comprehensive resource provides real-time updates and final scores from across the Empire State, ensuring you never miss a moment of the high school hops action throughout the season. From nail-biting finishes to dominant performances, the Rivals High School Scoreboard is your one-stop destination for tracking all the hardwood excitement across the state.",

If someone’s going to beat me, they’re going to have to hit a lot of tennis balls.”\n\nAnd the New South Wales state champion continued his win streak, beating professionals Amanda Anisimova and Pedro Martinez to reach the final, to the delight of the home crowd.\n\nSmith then ended the thrilling run of Joanna Garland, who failed to make it through qualifying for the Australian Open, only to beat Alexander Zverev and Nick Kyrgios.\n\nThe Taiwanese player won a game of rock, paper, scissors to determine who would decide who served and the 24-year-old opted to serve.\n\nThe world No 117’s serve was returned by Smith’s backhand, only for her own backhand to drift wide, handing the amateur victory.\n\nWorld No 1 Carlos Alcaraz shared a post on X, simply writing: “Jordan Smith.” The Spaniard could be seen wildly reacting to the end of the final after watching it backstage alongside fellow professionals.\n\n\"I can't even speak, that's unbelievable,” said Smith before detailing how he will spend his prize money.\n\n“[I will] invest or buy a house with my girlfriend. Coming into tonight, I was happy winning one point, I was so nervous, it was a great experience.”\n\nSmith’s club, Castle Hill Tennis Academy in Sydney, also benefited from his success, with Tennis Australia’s Chief Tennis Officer Tom Larner awarding them $50,000 to upgrade facilities and equipment.\n\nSmith had earlier lost the final of the amateurs, with Queensland qualifier Alec Reverente triumphing to land himself a new Kia car.",

    "fullText": "We appreciate comments from Christopher Henson, Zeke Medley, Ankit Kumar, and Pete Manolios. This post was initialized by Max’s twitter thread.\n\nThere's been a lot of chatter recently on HN and elsewhere about how formal verification is the obvious use-case for AI. While we broadly agree, we think much of the discourse is kinda wrong because it incorrectly presumes formal = slopless.[1]Over the years, we have written our fair share of good and bad formal code. In this post, we hope to convince you that formal code can be sloppy, and that this has serious implications for anyone who hopes to bootstrap superintelligence by using formality to reinforce “good” reasoning.\n\nA mainstay on the Lean Zulip named Gas Station Manager has written that hallucination-free program synthesis[2]is achievable by vibing software directly in Lean, with the caveat that the agent also needs to prove the software correct. The AI safety case is basically: wouldn’t it be great if a cheap (i.e. O(laptop)) signal could protect you from sycophantic hubris and other classes of mistake, without you having to manually audit all outputs?\n\nRecently a computer scientist (who we will spare from naming) was convinced he had solved a major mathematics problem. Lean was happy with it, he reasoned, given that his proof mostly worked, with just a few red squigglies. As seasoned proof engineers, we could have told him that in proof engineering, the growth in further needed edits is superlinear in number-of-red-squigglies (unlike in regular programming). The difference between mistakes in a proof and mistakes in a program is that you cannot fix a broken proof in a way that changes its formal goal (the theorem statement). In contrast, many, if not most changes to traditional software impact its formal spec, for example by adding a side-effect or changing the shape of an output. Therefore proof bugs are 1) harder to fix, and 2) more likely to imply that your goal is fundamentally unachievable (the theorem is wrong). This made up chart illustrates the principle, a rough “lore” level consensus in the field without any hard data.\n\nIt is possible he will post a finished proof, but the referee-time of bets he made has lapsed, so we can take away some lessons. Did our protagonist take to heart the promise of formal methods as slopless?\n\nIn much the same way that vibed code might work yet be “sloppy” in the sense that it’s difficult to maintain, vibed formal models can be correct, yet very challenging to prove anything about.\n\nOften when you model a system – or write code in a theorem-prover, with the intention of proving things about it – you actually need to make implementation decisions informed by the limitations and capabilities of the prover. For example, it's pretty common that inducting in one direction (say, car/head) on a list will be easy for a prover but the other direction (say cdr/tail) will be difficult. (This is a necessary evil if you want the prover to not enter infinite rewrite loops.) Thus, as an example, you might implement isort in a particular “direction” in order to make the proofs easier about it. If you want to autoformalize arbitrary code in a way that makes proofs straightforward, you’ll need models that understand how to implement something in a way that’s idiomatic for the given interactive theorem-prover.\n\nThis is a solvable problem but a real one nonetheless. For example, one Aristotle user we spoke to reported: “... in Lean you can put theorems inside mutual blocks to let them use each other. I wrote such a theorem, but then later realized proving it this way would be unnecessarily difficult. [...] The model won't do this, so it spent >24 hours on this almost hopeless proof.” Autoformalization companies like math.inc, Harmonic, Axiom, Logical Intelligence, etc. are actively working on improving their models to have this kind of expert folklore knowledge as we speak, but we’re not quite there yet.\n\nThere are basically two ways to make your software amenable to an interactive theorem prover (ITP). The first is to lift it into an ITP using a formal semantics – somewhat like a compiler or interpreter for the original language but implemented in the ITP itself. In this case, you can define the lifting so that it produces functionally equivalent code (say, Lean code that “does the same thing” as the input Python) but in a shape that the theorem-prover tends to like (incorporating heuristics like the car/cdr one mentioned above). The second approach is to just rewrite the original software directly in the language of the ITP, making those kinds of idiomacy improvements as-you-go. Both approaches, however, produce the same formal problem: ensuring that the software you wanted to study in the first place is semantically equivalent to the thing you introduced in the theorem-prover. IE., either ensuring the lifting is correct, or ensuring the manual translation is equivalent. Let’s dig into some of the ways this can be difficult.\n\nWhen we talk about using formal methods to assure that LLM-generated code is safe, what we want is a short, readable description of what the generated code is intended to do, some proof (which might be far too boring and long to read) that the code does this, and the ability to run the proof through a prover and validate that it indeed proves the aforementioned statement. But this is not necessarily a reasonable ask, regardless of model intelligence.\n\nFirst, it’s very common that you mis-define some concept such that the proof is accidentally trivial. For example, when defining a lifting from Python to Lean you might prove that the lifting preserves the semantics of the original Python code, but your proof could be undermined by the presumption that the code terminates, making it basically useless.\n\nSecond, if you re-implement the original software in your ITP of choice, your re-implementation might not be fully faithful, particularly if it’s LLM-generated. For example, the LLM might say, \"The code you wanted me to verify was too complex, so I rewrote it to be simpler and proved the simpler thing correct.\" Well, yeah, but the bugs I wanted you to find were in the complexity. As a concrete example, we asked an early version of Gemini to write a property based test (PBT) for a (deliberately flawed) isort implementation which we provided; Gemini did so but rewrote the isort code to be correct in the process and then executed the PBT and cheerfully reported that it passed.\n\nThese first two problems are commonly addressed using tests which compare the original software to its representation in the ITP. For example, we (Max) did this with coauthors for GossipSub, connecting the Golang implementation to its ACL2(s) model via both unit tests and property-based tests.[3]To quote Knuth: “Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it.”\n\nThird, you need to decide how far “down the stack” you want to go. That is to say, the software you want to verify operates over some kind of more complex system, for instance, maybe it’s C code which gets compiled down to X86 and runs on a particular chip, or maybe it’s a controller for a nuclear reactor and part of the system is the actual physical dynamics of the reactor. Do you really want your proof to involve specifying the semantics of the C compiler and the chip, or the way that the temperature and other variables fluctuate in the reactor? Keeping in mind these semantics might not truly be known – e.g., RowHammer can be viewed as an attack on our understanding of the semantics of the chip. In essence, you can only get more specificity by vastly increasing the length of your proof statement to capture the semantics of the underlying system, which then produces a new (and perhaps equally difficult) code review problem. Typically this problem is handled by leaving the underlying semantics nondeterministic, so your proof is stronger (it holds regardless of how the C compiler handles floating point, or how the temperature fluctuates in the nuclear silo) but often the thing you want to prove really does require some pretty specific guarantees about those underlying semantics, and ensuring those guarantees are “reasonable” can be extraordinarily difficult.\n\nThe AI might introduce axioms that conflict with your own presuppositions or the specific requirements of your domain. In Lean, for example, the Axiom of Choice (Classical.choice) is available but transforms a proof from a constructive one—where you can actually compute a result—into a non-constructive one. An AI tasked with verifying a program might realize that a proof is significantly easier if it assumes AC. It might inform you that the theorem is \"proven,\" and the prover will confirm this, but you may not realize that the resulting proof is now a \"lie\" for your specific use case. If you needed that proof to generate an executable, verified algorithm, the introduction of non-constructive axioms shifts you into an incompatible register.\n\nThe person designing the harness for the AI needs to be an expert who knows how to parse these imports and error messages. Without that oversight, the AI will naturally gravitate toward the path of least resistance—even if that path involves an axiomatic shift that renders the entire exercise useless for the user's true intent.\n\nConsider the proof assistant ACL2, which accepts arbitrary lisp code.[4]You write defttag, the trusted tag to open the “trust me” scope. In other words, defttag offloads the soundness obligations to the user. Observe a proof that 1+1=3 in ACL2 with defttag.\n\n“Well yeah”, perhaps comes a reply. “It only looks like 1+1=3 in the nonsensical sense if you deliberately ignore that the meaning of plus has shifted”. “Besides”, they continue. “When my coworker sends me code with defttag in it, I read it very rigorously”. Our retort is that we don’t assume our coworkers are competent or trustworthy, we assume that they’re AIs with a tendency to reward hack. To recap:\n\nAdditionally, proof tools like Lean pile a bunch of ergonomic and notational niceties on top of their core calculus, in Lean’s case with powerful metaprogramming. But this metaprogramming can lead to backdoors much like the ACL2 example.[6]\n\nFrom nothing arises everything. From a proof of false you can derive literally any proposition.\n\nIn Agda, a calculus of inductive constructions popular with mathematical type theorists, the github issue label “false” tracking proofs of false is standing at 9 open and 74 closed issues at time of this writing. A proof of false is a soundness bug[7], which if you think proof synthesis plays a role in high stakes AI security (like SL5), means you have to be paranoid about a glaring attack surface.\n\nWhile we can’t yet think of a case of sicophancy/hubris that was accelerated by an arcane proof of false, we expect this becomes increasingly likely as insecure program synthesis tools get more capable and accessible in contexts where they are incentivized to reward-hack a proof.\n\nIf someone says \"stats don’t lie\" you say \"well don’t be naive, you can tell misleading stories with technically true statistics\".[8]Formal verification is the same. Don’t be lured into the false sense of security. To paraphrase Twain, “There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and proofs.” We already know models lie to us; we should fully expect them to prove falsehoods, too.\n\nIn spite of our warnings, which may seem pessimistic, we’re working on secure program synthesis (or what Mike Dodds calls scalable formal oversight) for AI security. The reason we can work on this anyway is because we see a lit path, principally routing through specification elicitation[9]and validation as well as hardened proof cores and (the cherry on top) superpowered proof synthesis. Spec elicitation and validation, in particular, have not seen the upside from language model assisted transpilation fully harvested just yet.\n\nThis intuition might be in part driven by academic papers that push formality as a cure to sloppiness, e.g., Run Your Research and HACMS. But even formally verified software can be buggy! ↩︎\n\nAs a historical aside, the original citation for program synthesis is: Church, A.: Application of recursive arithmetic to the problem of circuit synthesis (7 1957), presented at IDA, as cited in doi:10.2307/2271310. ↩︎\n\nCedar comes to mind as a similar case-study in Lean. ↩︎\n\nThis feature is useful for proving things about real-world LISP code, or connecting ACL2 code which is proven to be correct to real-world systems via LISP harnesses. ↩︎\n\nSee also Pollack-consistency, a kind of LangSec concept of theorem-prover backdooring. ↩︎\n\nThere are some subtleties here we elide, which Christopher Henson plans to explore in a more technical forthcoming blog post. ↩︎\n\nSee also The Difference Between “Significant” and “Not Significant” is not Itself Statistically Significant. ↩︎\n\nAcademia is certain that specification is hard (see also Formal Methods for Security) and we should fix it, but unsure as to why or how to improve the situation. ↩︎",

    "fullText": "Have you heard about the “three pillars of observability” yet? No? The story goes like this:\n\nIf you’re using microservices, you already know that they’re nearly impossible to understand using a conventional monitoring toolchain: since microservices were literally designed to prevent “two-pizza” DevOps teams from knowing about each other, it turns out that it’s incredibly difficult for any individual to understand the whole, or even their nearest neighbor in the service graph.\n\nWell, Google and Facebook, and Netflix were building microservices before they were called microservices, and I read on Twitter that they already solved all of these problems… phew! They did it using Metrics, Logging, and Distributed Tracing, so you should, too – those are called “The Three Pillars of Observability,” and you probably even know what they look like already:\n\nSo, if you want to solve observability problems like Google and Facebook, and Twitter, it’s simple… find a metrics provider, a logging provider, a tracing provider, and voila: your DevOps teams will bask in the light of an observable distributed system.\n\nPerhaps the above is hyperbolic. Still, for those who deployed “the three pillars” as bare technologies, the initial excitement dissipated quickly as fatal flaws emerged.\n\nFor Metrics, we all needed to learn a new vocab word: cardinality. The beauty of metrics is that they make it easy to see when something bad happened: the metric looks like a squiggly line, and you can see it jump up (or down) when something bad happens. But diagnosing those anomalous moments is deeply difficult using metrics alone… the best we can do is to “drill down,” which usually means grouping the metric by a tag, hoping that a specific tag value explains the anomaly, then filtering by that tag and iterating on the drill-down process.\n\n“Cardinality” refers to the number of elements in a set. In the case of metrics, cardinality refers to the number of values for any particular metric tag. If there are 5 values, we’re probably fine; 50 might be ok; 500 is probably too expensive; and once we get into the thousands, you simply can’t justify the ROI. Unfortunately, many real-world tags have thousands or millions of values (e.g., user-id, container-id, and so forth), so metrics often prove to be a dead end from an investigative standpoint.\n\nFor Logs, the problem is simpler to describe: they just become too expensive, period. I was at a speaker dinner before a monitoring conference last year, and one of the other presenters – a really smart, reputable individual who ran the logging efforts for one of today’s most iconic tech companies – was giving a talk the following day about how to approach logging in a microservices environment. I was excited about the topic and asked him what his basic thesis was. He said, “Oh, it’s very simple: don’t log things anymore.”\n\nIt’s easy to understand why: if we want to use logs to account for individual transactions (like we used to in the days of a monolithic web server’s request logs), we would need to pay for the following:\n\nLogging systems can’t afford to store data about every transaction anymore because the cost of those transactional logs is proportional to the number of microservices touched by an average transaction. Not to mention that the logs themselves are less useful (independent of cost) due to the analytical need to understand concurrency and causality in microservice transactions. So conventional logging isn’t sufficient in our brave new architectural world.\n\nWhich brings us to “Distributed Tracing,” a technology specifically developed to address the above problem with logging systems. I built out the Dapper project at Google myself. It certainly had its uses, especially for steady-state latency analysis, but we dealt with the data volume problem by applying braindead, entirely random, and very aggressive sampling. This has long been the elephant in the room for distributed tracing, and it’s the reason why Dapper was awkward to apply in on-call scenarios.\n\nThe obvious answer would be to avoid sampling altogether. For scaled-out microservices, though, the cost is a non-starter. It’s more realistic to defer the sampling decision until the transaction has completed: this is an improvement, though that approach masks a crucial question: which traces should we sample, anyway? If we’re restricting our analysis to individual traces, we typically focus on “the slow ones” or those that result in an error; however, performance and reliability problems in production software are typically a byproduct of interference between transactions, and understanding that interference involves much more sophisticated sampling strategies that aggregate across related traces that contend for the same resources.\n\nIn any case, a single distributed trace is occasionally useful, but a bit of a hail mary. Sampling the right distributed traces and extracting meaningful, accessible insights is a broader challenge, yet much more valuable.\n\nAnother issue with “The Three Pillars” is the very notion that we should always aspire to build software that’s appropriate for the “planet-scale” infrastructure at Google (or Facebook, or Twitter, and so on). Long story short: don’t emulate Google. This is not a dig on Google – there are some brilliant people there, and they’ve done some terrific work given their requirements.\n\nBut! Google’s technologies are built to scale like crazy, and that isn’t necessarily “good”: Jeff Dean (one of those brilliant Googlers who deserves all of the accolades – he even has his own meme) would sometimes talk about how it’s nearly impossible to design a software system that’s appropriate for more than 3-4 orders of magnitude of scale. Further, there is a natural tension between a system’s scalability and its feature set.\n\nGoogle’s microservices generate about 5 billion RPCs per second; building observability tools that scale to 5B RPCs/sec, therefore, boils down to building observability tools that are profoundly feature-poor. If your organization is doing more like 5 million RPCs/sec, that’s still quite impressive, but you should almost certainly not use what Google uses: at 1/1000th the scale, you can afford much more powerful features.\n\nSo each “pillar” has a fatal flaw (or three), and that’s a problem. The other problem is even more fundamental: Metrics, Logs, and Distributed Traces are just bits. Each describes a particular type of data structure, and when we think of them, we tend to think of the most trivial visualization of those data structures: metrics look like squiggly lines; logs look like a chronological listing of formatted strings; and traces look like those nested waterfall timing diagrams.\n\nNone of the above directly addresses a particular pain point, use case, or business need. That is, with the “three pillars” orthodoxy, we implicitly delegate the extraordinarily complex task of actually analyzing the metric, log, and trace data as “an exercise to the reader.” And, given the fatal flaws above and the subtle interactions and co-dependencies between these three types of data, our observability suffers greatly as a result.\n\nSo metrics, logs, and traces aren’t “the observability,” they’re just the telemetry. Then what is observability? If the raw data isn’t intrinsically valuable, what is? Is Observability just a new word for Monitoring? And can we get it with a single fancy database?\n\nThese are all excellent questions with non-obvious answers. They’re also out of scope for this article, but you can learn more about all of this here: Observability Won’t Replace Monitoring (Because it Shouldn’t). There is a way to make telemetry valuable – transformative, even – but we’ll need a better model for Observability first.",

    "title": "How to write a good spec for AI agents",
    "description": "Learn how to write effective specifications for AI coding agents to improve clarity, focus, and productivity in your AI-driven development workflows.",
    "fullText": "TL;DR: Aim for a clear spec covering just enough nuance (this may include structure, style, testing, boundaries) to guide the AI without overwhelming it. Break large tasks into smaller ones vs. keeping everything in one large prompt. Plan first in read-only mode, then execute and iterate continuously.\n\n“I’ve heard a lot about writing good specs for AI agents, but haven’t found a solid framework yet. I could write a spec that rivals an RFC, but at some point the context is too large and the model breaks down.”\n\nMany developers share this frustration. Simply throwing a massive spec at an AI agent doesn’t work - context window limits and the model’s “attention budget” get in the way. The key is to write smart specs: documents that guide the agent clearly, stay within practical context sizes, and evolve with the project. This guide distills best practices from my use of coding agents including Claude Code and Gemini CLI into a framework for spec-writing that keeps your AI agents focused and productive.\n\nWe’ll cover five principles for great AI agent specs, each starting with a bolded takeaway.\n\nKick off your project with a concise high-level spec, then have the AI expand it into a detailed plan.\n\nInstead of over-engineering upfront, begin with a clear goal statement and a few core requirements. Treat this as a “product brief” and let the agent generate a more elaborate spec from it. This leverages the AI’s strength in elaboration while you maintain control of the direction. This works well unless you already feel you have very specific technical requirements that must be met from the start.\n\nWhy this works: LLM-based agents excel at fleshing out details when given a solid high-level directive, but they need a clear mission to avoid drifting off course. By providing a short outline or objective description and asking the AI to produce a full specification (e.g. a spec.md), you create a persistent reference for the agent. Planning in advance matters even more with an agent - you can iterate on the plan first, then hand it off to the agent to write the code. The spec becomes the first artifact you and the AI build together.\n\nPractical approach: Start a new coding session by prompting, “You are an AI software engineer. Draft a detailed specification for [project X] covering objectives, features, constraints, and a step-by-step plan.” Keep your initial prompt high-level - e.g. “Build a web app where users can track tasks (to-do list), with user accounts, a database, and a simple UI”. The agent might respond with a structured draft spec: an overview, feature list, tech stack suggestions, data model, and so on. This spec then becomes the “source of truth” that both you and the agent can refer back to. GitHub’s AI team promotes spec-driven development where “specs become the shared source of truth… living, executable artifacts that evolve with the project”. Before writing any code, review and refine the AI’s spec. Make sure it aligns with your vision and correct any hallucinations or off-target details.\n\nUse Plan Mode to enforce planning-first: Tools like Claude Code offer a Plan Mode that restricts the agent to read-only operations - it can analyze your codebase and create detailed plans but won’t write any code until you’re ready. This is ideal for the planning phase: start in Plan Mode (Shift+Tab in Claude Code), describe what you want to build, and let the agent draft a spec while exploring your existing code. Ask it to clarify ambiguities by questioning you about the plan. Have it review the plan for architecture, best practices, security risks, and testing strategy. The goal is to refine the plan until there’s no room for misinterpretation. Only then do you exit Plan Mode and let the agent execute. This workflow prevents the common trap of jumping straight into code generation before the spec is solid.\n\nUse the spec as context: Once approved, save this spec (e.g. as SPEC.md) and feed relevant sections into the agent as needed. Many developers using a strong model do exactly this - the spec file persists between sessions, anchoring the AI whenever work resumes on the project. This mitigates the forgetfulness that can happen when the conversation history gets too long or when you have to restart an agent. It’s akin to how one would use a Product Requirements Document (PRD) in a team: a reference that everyone (human or AI) can consult to stay on track. Experienced folks often “write good documentation first and the model may be able to build the matching implementation from that input alone” as one engineer observed. The spec is that documentation.\n\nKeep it goal-oriented: A high-level spec for an AI agent should focus on what and why, more than the nitty-gritty how (at least initially). Think of it like the user story and acceptance criteria: Who is the user? What do they need? What does success look like? (e.g. “User can add, edit, complete tasks; data is saved persistently; the app is responsive and secure”). This keeps the AI’s detailed spec grounded in user needs and outcome, not just technical to-dos. As the GitHub Spec Kit docs put it, provide a high-level description of what you’re building and why, and let the coding agent generate a detailed specification focusing on user experience and success criteria. Starting with this big-picture vision prevents the agent from losing sight of the forest for the trees when it later gets into coding.\n\nTreat your AI spec as a structured document (PRD) with clear sections, not a loose pile of notes.\n\nMany developers treat specs for agents much like traditional Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) or System Design docs - comprehensive, well-organized, and easy for a “literal-minded” AI to parse. This formal approach gives the agent a blueprint to follow and reduces ambiguity.\n\nThe six core areas: GitHub’s analysis of over 2,500 agent configuration files revealed a clear pattern: the most effective specs cover six areas. Use this as a checklist for completeness:\n\n1. Commands: Put executable commands early - not just tool names, but full commands with flags: npm test, pytest -v, npm run build. The agent will reference these constantly.\n\n2. Testing: How to run tests, what framework you use, where test files live, and what coverage expectations exist.\n\n3. Project structure: Where source code lives, where tests go, where docs belong. Be explicit: “src/ for application code, tests/ for unit tests, docs/ for documentation.”\n\n4. Code style: One real code snippet showing your style beats three paragraphs describing it. Include naming conventions, formatting rules, and examples of good output.\n\n5. Git workflow: Branch naming, commit message format, PR requirements. The agent can follow these if you spell them out.\n\n6. Boundaries: What the agent should never touch - secrets, vendor directories, production configs, specific folders. “Never commit secrets” was the single most common helpful constraint in the GitHub study.\n\nBe specific about your stack: Say “React 18 with TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS” not “React project.” Include versions and key dependencies. Vague specs produce vague code.\n\nUse a consistent format: Clarity is king. Many devs use Markdown headings or even XML-like tags in the spec to delineate sections, because AI models handle well-structured text better than free-form prose. For example, you might structure the spec as:\n\nThis level of organization not only helps you think clearly, it helps the AI find information. Anthropic engineers recommend organizing prompts into distinct sections (like <background>, <instructions>, <tools>, <output_format> etc.) for exactly this reason - it gives the model strong cues about which info is which. And remember, “minimal does not necessarily mean short” - don’t shy away from detail in the spec if it matters, but keep it focused.\n\nIntegrate specs into your toolchain: Treat specs as “executable artifacts” tied to version control and CI/CD. The GitHub Spec Kit uses a four-phase, gated workflow that makes your specification the center of your engineering process. Instead of writing a spec and setting it aside, the spec drives the implementation, checklists, and task breakdowns. Your primary role is to steer; the coding agent does the bulk of the writing. Each phase has a specific job, and you don’t move to the next one until the current task is fully validated:\n\n1. Specify: You provide a high-level description of what you’re building and why, and the coding agent generates a detailed specification. This isn’t about technical stacks or app design - it’s about user journeys, experiences, and what success looks like. Who will use this? What problem does it solve? How will they interact with it? Think of it as mapping the user experience you want to create, and letting the coding agent flesh out the details. This becomes a living artifact that evolves as you learn more.\n\n2. Plan: Now you get technical. You provide your desired stack, architecture, and constraints, and the coding agent generates a comprehensive technical plan. If your company standardizes on certain technologies, this is where you say so. If you’re integrating with legacy systems or have compliance requirements, all of that goes here. You can ask for multiple plan variations to compare approaches. If you make internal docs available, the agent can integrate your architectural patterns directly into the plan.\n\n3. Tasks: The coding agent takes the spec and plan and breaks them into actual work - small, reviewable chunks that each solve a specific piece of the puzzle. Each task should be something you can implement and test in isolation, almost like test-driven development for your AI agent. Instead of “build authentication,” you get concrete tasks like “create a user registration endpoint that validates email format.”\n\n4. Implement: Your coding agent tackles tasks one by one (or in parallel). Instead of reviewing thousand-line code dumps, you review focused changes that solve specific problems. The agent knows what to build (specification), how to build it (plan), and what to work on (task). Crucially, your role is to verify at each phase: Does the spec capture what you want? Does the plan account for constraints? Are there edge cases the AI missed? The process builds in checkpoints for you to critique, spot gaps, and course-correct before moving forward.\n\nThis gated workflow prevents what Willison calls “house of cards code” - fragile AI outputs that collapse under scrutiny. Anthropic’s Skills system offers a similar pattern, letting you define reusable Markdown-based behaviors that agents invoke. By embedding your spec in these workflows, you ensure the agent can’t proceed until the spec is validated, and changes propagate automatically to task breakdowns and tests.\n\nConsider agents.md for specialized personas: For tools like GitHub Copilot, you can create agents.md files that define specialized agent personas - a @docs-agent for technical writing, a @test-agent for QA, a @security-agent for code review. Each file acts as a focused spec for that persona’s behavior, commands, and boundaries. This is particularly useful when you want different agents for different tasks rather than one general-purpose assistant.\n\nDesign for Agent Experience (AX): Just as we design APIs for developer experience (DX), consider designing specs for “Agent Experience.” This means clean, parseable formats: OpenAPI schemas for any APIs the agent will consume, llms.txt files that summarize documentation for LLM consumption, and explicit type definitions. The Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF) is standardizing protocols like MCP (Model Context Protocol) for tool integration - specs that follow these patterns are easier for agents to consume and act on reliably.\n\nPRD vs SRS mindset: It helps to borrow from established documentation practices. For AI agent specs, you’ll often blend these into one document (as illustrated above), but covering both angles serves you well. Writing it like a PRD ensures you include user-centric context (“the why behind each feature”) so the AI doesn’t optimize for the wrong thing. Expanding it like an SRS ensures you nail down the specifics the AI will need to actually generate correct code (like what database or API to use). Developers have found that this extra upfront effort pays off by drastically reducing miscommunications with the agent later.\n\nMake the spec a “living document”: Don’t write it and forget it. Update the spec as you and the agent make decisions or discover new info. If the AI had to change the data model or you decided to cut a feature, reflect that in the spec so it remains the ground truth. Think of it as version-controlled documentation. In spec-driven workflows, the spec drives implementation, tests, and task breakdowns, and you don’t move to coding until the spec is validated. This habit keeps the project coherent, especially if you or the agent step away and come back later. Remember, the spec isn’t just for the AI - it helps you as the developer maintain oversight and ensure the AI’s work meets the real requirements.\n\nDivide and conquer: give the AI one focused task at a time rather than a monolithic prompt with everything at once.\n\nExperienced AI engineers have learned that trying to stuff the entire project (all requirements, all code, all instructions) into a single prompt or agent message is a recipe for confusion. Not only do you risk hitting token limits, you also risk the model losing focus due to the “curse of instructions” - too many directives causing it to follow none of them well. The solution is to design your spec and workflow in a modular way, tackling one piece at a time and pulling in only the context needed for that piece.\n\nThe curse of too much context/instructions: Research has confirmed what many devs anecdotally saw: as you pile on more instructions or data into the prompt, the model’s performance in adhering to each one drops significantly. One study dubbed this the “curse of instructions”, showing that even GPT-4 and Claude struggle when asked to satisfy many requirements simultaneously. In practical terms, if you present 10 bullet points of detailed rules, the AI might obey the first few and start overlooking others. The better strategy is iterative focus. Guidelines from industry suggest decomposing complex requirements into sequential, simple instructions as a best practice. Focus the AI on one sub-problem at a time, get that done, then move on. This keeps the quality high and errors manageable.\n\nDivide the spec into phases or components: If your spec document is very long or covers a lot of ground, consider splitting it into parts (either physically separate files or clearly separate sections). For example, you might have a section for “Backend API Spec” and another for “Frontend UI Spec.” You don’t need to always feed the frontend spec to the AI when it’s working on the backend, and vice versa. Many devs using multi-agent setups even create separate agents or sub-processes for each part - e.g. one agent works on database/schema, another on API logic, another on frontend - each with the relevant slice of the spec. Even if you use a single agent, you can emulate this by copying only the relevant spec section into the prompt for that task. Avoid context overload: Don’t mix authentication tasks with database schema changes in one go, as the DigitalOcean AI guide warns. Keep each prompt tightly scoped to the current goal.\n\nExtended TOC / Summaries for large specs: One clever technique is to have the agent build an extended Table of Contents with summaries for the spec. This is essentially a “spec summary” that condenses each section into a few key points or keywords, and references where details can be found. For example, if your full spec has a section on “Security Requirements” spanning 500 words, you might have the agent summarize it to: “Security: use HTTPS, protect API keys, implement input validation (see full spec §4.2)”. By creating a hierarchical summary in the planning phase, you get a bird’s-eye view that can stay in the prompt, while the fine details remain offloaded unless needed. This extended TOC acts as an index: the agent can consult it and say “aha, there’s a security section I should look at”, and you can then provide that section on demand. It’s similar to how a human developer skims an outline and then flips to the relevant page of a spec document when working on a specific part.\n\nTo implement this, you can prompt the agent after writing the spec: “Summarize the spec above into a very concise outline with each section’s key points and a reference tag.” The result might be a list of sections with one or two sentence summaries. That summary can be kept in the system or assistant message to guide the agent’s focus without eating up too many tokens. This hierarchical summarization approach is known to help LLMs maintain long-term context by focusing on the high-level structure. The agent carries a “mental map” of the spec.\n\nUtilize sub-agents or “skills” for different spec parts: Another advanced approach is using multiple specialized agents (what Anthropic calls subagents or what you might call “skills”). Each subagent is configured for a specific area of expertise and given the portion of the spec relevant to that area. For instance, you might have a Database Designer subagent that only knows about the data model section of the spec, and an API Coder subagent that knows the API endpoints spec. The main agent (or an orchestrator) can route tasks to the appropriate subagent automatically. The benefit is each agent has a smaller context window to deal with and a more focused role, which can boost accuracy and allow parallel work on independent tasks. Anthropic’s Claude Code supports this by letting you define subagents with their own system prompts and tools. “Each subagent has a specific purpose and expertise area, uses its own context window separate from the main conversation, and has a custom system prompt guiding its behavior,” as their docs describe. When a task comes up that matches a subagent’s domain, Claude can delegate that task to it, with the subagent returning results independently.\n\nParallel agents for throughput: Running multiple agents simultaneously is emerging as “the next big thing” for developer productivity. Rather than waiting for one agent to finish before starting another task, you can spin up parallel agents for non-overlapping work. Willison describes this as “embracing parallel coding agents” and notes it’s “surprisingly effective, if mentally exhausting”. The key is scoping tasks so agents don’t step on each other - one agent codes a feature while another writes tests, or separate components get built concurrently. Orchestration frameworks like LangGraph or OpenAI Swarm can help coordinate these agents, and shared memory via vector databases (like Chroma) lets them access common context without redundant prompting.\n\nSingle vs. multi-agent: when to use each\n\nIn practice, using subagents or skill-specific prompts might look like: you maintain multiple spec files (or prompt templates) - e.g. SPEC_backend.md, SPEC_frontend.md - and you tell the AI, “For backend tasks, refer to SPEC_backend; for frontend tasks refer to SPEC_frontend.” Or in a tool like Cursor/Claude, you actually spin up a subagent for each. This is certainly more complex to set up than a single-agent loop, but it mimics what human developers do - we mentally compartmentalize a large spec into relevant chunks (you don’t keep the whole 50-page spec in your head at once; you recall the part you need for the task at hand, and have a general sense of the overall architecture). The challenge, as noted, is managing interdependencies: the subagents must still coordinate (the frontend needs to know the API contract from the backend spec, etc.). A central overview (or an “architect” agent) can help by referencing the sub-specs and ensuring consistency.\n\nFocus each prompt on one task/section: Even without fancy multi-agent setups, you can manually enforce modularity. For example, after the spec is written, your next move might be: “Step 1: Implement the database schema.” You feed the agent the Database section of the spec only, plus any global constraints from the spec (like tech stack). The agent works on that. Then for Step 2, “Now implement the authentication feature”, you provide the Auth section of the spec and maybe the relevant parts of the schema if needed. By refreshing the context for each major task, you ensure the model isn’t carrying a lot of stale or irrelevant information that could distract it. As one guide suggests: “Start fresh: begin new sessions to clear context when switching between major features”. You can always remind the agent of critical global rules (from the spec’s Constraints section) each time, but don’t shove the entire spec in if it’s not all needed.\n\nUse in-line directives and code TODOs: Another modularity trick is to use your code or spec as an active part of the conversation. For instance, scaffold your code with // TODO comments that describe what needs to be done, and have the agent fill them one by one. Each TODO essentially acts as a mini-spec for a small task. This keeps the AI laser-focused (“implement this specific function according to this spec snippet”) and you can iterate in a tight loop. It’s similar to giving the AI a checklist item to complete rather than the whole checklist at once.\n\nThe bottom line: small, focused context beats one giant prompt. This improves quality and keeps the AI from getting “overwhelmed” by too much at once. As one set of best practices sums up, provide “One Task Focus” and “Relevant info only” to the model, and avoid dumping everything everywhere. By structuring the work into modules - and using strategies like spec summaries or sub-spec agents - you’ll navigate around context size limits and the AI’s short-term memory cap. Remember, a well-fed AI is like a well-fed function: give it only the inputs it needs for the job at hand.\n\nMake your spec not just a to-do list for the agent, but also a guide for quality control - and don’t be afraid to inject your own expertise.\n\nA good spec for an AI agent anticipates where the AI might go wrong and sets up guardrails. It also takes advantage of what you know (domain knowledge, edge cases, “gotchas”) so the AI doesn’t operate in a vacuum. Think of the spec as both coach and referee for the AI: it should encourage the right approach and call out fouls.\n\nUse three-tier boundaries: The GitHub analysis of 2,500+ agent files found that the most effective specs use a three-tier boundary system rather than a simple list of don’ts. This gives the agent clearer guidance on when to proceed, when to pause, and when to stop:\n\n✅ Always do: Actions the agent should take without asking. “Always run tests before commits.” “Always follow the naming conventions in the style guide.” “Always log errors to the monitoring service.”\n\n⚠️ Ask first: Actions that require human approval. “Ask before modifying database schemas.” “Ask before adding new dependencies.” “Ask before changing CI/CD configuration.” This tier catches high-impact changes that might be fine but warrant a human check.\n\n🚫 Never do: Hard stops. “Never commit secrets or API keys.” “Never edit node_modules/ or vendor/.” “Never remove a failing test without explicit approval.” “Never commit secrets” was the single most common helpful constraint in the study.\n\nThis three-tier approach is more nuanced than a flat list of rules. It acknowledges that some actions are always safe, some need oversight, and some are categorically off-limits. The agent can proceed confidently on “Always” items, flag “Ask first” items for review, and hard-stop on “Never” items.\n\nEncourage self-verification: One powerful pattern is to have the agent verify its work against the spec automatically. If your tooling allows, you can integrate checks like unit tests or linting that the AI can run after generating code. But even at the spec/prompt level, you can instruct the AI to double-check: e.g. “After implementing, compare the result with the spec and confirm all requirements are met. List any spec items that are not addressed.” This pushes the LLM to reflect on its output relative to the spec, catching omissions. It’s a form of self-audit built into the process.\n\nFor instance, you might append to a prompt: “(After writing the function, review the above requirements list and ensure each is satisfied, marking any missing ones).” The model will then (ideally) output the code followed by a short checklist indicating if it met each requirement. This reduces the chance it forgets something before you even run tests. It’s not foolproof, but it helps.\n\nLLM-as-a-Judge for subjective checks: For criteria that are hard to test automatically - code style, readability, adherence to architectural patterns - consider using “LLM-as-a-Judge.” This means having a second agent (or a separate prompt) review the first agent’s output against your spec’s quality guidelines. Anthropic and others have found this effective for subjective evaluation. You might prompt: “Review this code for adherence to our style guide. Flag any violations.” The judge agent returns feedback that either gets incorporated or triggers a revision. This adds a layer of semantic evaluation beyond syntax checks.\n\nConformance testing: Willison advocates building conformance suites - language-independent tests (often YAML-based) that any implementation must pass. These act as a contract: if you’re building an API, the conformance suite specifies expected inputs/outputs, and the agent’s code must satisfy all cases. This is more rigorous than ad-hoc unit tests because it’s derived directly from the spec and can be reused across implementations. Include conformance criteria in your spec’s Success section (e.g., “Must pass all cases in conformance/api-tests.yaml”).\n\nLeverage testing in the spec: If possible, incorporate a test plan or even actual tests in your spec and prompt flow. In traditional development, we use TDD or write test cases to clarify requirements - you can do the same with AI. For example, in the spec’s Success Criteria, you might say “These sample inputs should produce these outputs…” or “the following unit tests should pass.” The agent can be prompted to run through those cases in its head or actually execute them if it has that capability. Simon Willison noted that having a robust test suite is like giving the agents superpowers - they can validate and iterate quickly when tests fail. In an AI coding context, writing a bit of pseudocode for tests or expected outcomes in the spec can guide the agent’s implementation. Additionally, you can use a dedicated “test agent” in a subagent setup that takes the spec’s criteria and continuously verifies the “code agent’s” output.\n\nBring your domain knowledge: Your spec should reflect insights that only an experienced developer or someone with context would know. For example, if you’re building an e-commerce agent and you know that “products” and “categories” have a many-to-many relationship, state that clearly (don’t assume the AI will infer it - it might not). If a certain library is notoriously tricky, mention pitfalls to avoid. Essentially, pour your mentorship into the spec. The spec can contain advice like “If using library X, watch out for memory leak issue in version Y (apply workaround Z).” This level of detail is what turns an average AI output into a truly robust solution, because you’ve steered the AI away from common traps.\n\nAlso, if you have preferences or style guidelines (say, “use functional components over class components in React”), encode that in the spec. The AI will then emulate your style. Many engineers even include small examples in the spec, e.g., “All API responses should be JSON. E.g. {“error”: “message”} for errors.” By giving a quick example, you anchor the AI to the exact format you want.\n\nMinimalism for simple tasks: While we advocate thorough specs, part of expertise is knowing when to keep it simple. For relatively simple, isolated tasks, an overbearing spec can actually confuse more than help. If you’re asking the agent to do something straightforward (like “center a div on the page”), you might just say, “Make sure to keep the solution concise and do not add extraneous markup or styles.” No need for a full PRD there. Conversely, for complex tasks (like “implement an OAuth flow with token refresh and error handling”), that’s when you break out the detailed spec. A good rule of thumb: adjust spec detail to task complexity. Don’t under-spec a hard problem (the agent will flail or go off-track), but don’t over-spec a trivial one (the agent might get tangled or use up context on unnecessary instructions).\n\nMaintain the AI’s “persona” if needed: Sometimes, part of your spec is defining how the agent should behave or respond, especially if the agent interacts with users. For example, if building a customer support agent, your spec might include guidelines like “Use a friendly and professional tone,” “If you don’t know the answer, ask for clarification or offer to follow up, rather than guessing.” These kind of rules (often included in system prompts) help keep the AI’s outputs aligned with expectations. They are essentially spec items for AI behavior. Keep them consistent and remind the model of them if needed in long sessions (LLMs can “drift” in style over time if not kept on a leash).\n\nYou remain the exec in the loop: The spec empowers the agent, but you remain the ultimate quality filter. If the agent produces something that technically meets the spec but doesn’t feel right, trust your judgement. Either refine the spec or directly adjust the output. The great thing about AI agents is they don’t get offended - if they deliver a design that’s off, you can say, “Actually, that’s not what I intended, let’s clarify the spec and redo it.” The spec is a living artifact in collaboration with the AI, not a one-time contract you can’t change.\n\nSimon Willison humorously likened working with AI agents to “a very weird form of management” and even “getting good results out of a coding agent feels uncomfortably close to managing a human intern”. You need to provide clear instructions (the spec), ensure they have the necessary context (the spec and relevant data), and give actionable feedback. The spec sets the stage, but monitoring and feedback during execution are key. If an AI was a “weird digital intern who will absolutely cheat if you give them a chance”, the spec and constraints you write are how you prevent that cheating and keep them on task.\n\nHere’s the payoff: a good spec doesn’t just tell the AI what to build, it also helps it self-correct and stay within safe boundaries. By baking in verification steps, constraints, and your hard-earned knowledge, you drastically increase the odds that the agent’s output is correct on the first try (or at least much closer to correct). This reduces iterations and those “why on Earth did it do that?” moments.\n\nThink of spec-writing and agent-building as an iterative loop: test early, gather feedback, refine the spec, and leverage tools to automate checks.\n\nThe initial spec is not the end - it’s the beginning of a cycle. The best outcomes come when you continually verify the agent’s work against the spec and adjust accordingly. Also, modern AI devs use various tools to support this process (from CI pipelines to context management utilities).\n\nContinuous testing: Don’t wait until the end to see if the agent met the spec. After each major milestone or even each function, run tests or at least do quick manual checks. If something fails, update the spec or prompt before proceeding. For example, if the spec said “passwords must be hashed with bcrypt” and you see the agent’s code storing plain text - stop and correct it (and remind the spec or prompt about the rule). Automated tests shine here: if you provided tests (or write them as you go), let the agent run them. In many coding agent setups, you can have an agent run npm test or similar after finishing a task. The results (failures) can then feed back into the next prompt, effectively telling the agent “your output didn’t meet spec on X, Y, Z - fix it.” This kind of agentic loop (code -> test -> fix -> repeat) is extremely powerful and is how tools like Claude Code or Copilot Labs are evolving to handle larger tasks. Always define what “done” means (via tests or criteria) and check for it.\n\nIterate on the spec itself: If you discover that the spec was incomplete or unclear (maybe the agent misunderstood something or you realized you missed a requirement), update the spec document. Then explicitly re-sync the agent with the new spec: “I have updated the spec as follows… Given the updated spec, adjust the plan or refactor the code accordingly.” This way the spec remains the single source of truth. It’s similar to how we handle changing requirements in normal dev - but in this case you’re also the product manager for your AI agent. Keep version history if possible (even just via commit messages or notes), so you know what changed and why.\n\nUtilize context-management and memory tools: There’s a growing ecosystem of tools to help manage AI agent context and knowledge. For instance, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a pattern where the agent can pull in relevant chunks of data from a knowledge base (like a vector database) on the fly. If your spec is huge, you could embed sections of it and let the agent retrieve the most relevant parts when needed, instead of always providing the whole thing. There are also frameworks implementing the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which automates feeding the right context to the model based on the current task. One example is Context7 (context7.com), which can auto-fetch relevant context snippets from docs based on what you’re working on. In practice, this might mean the agent notices you’re working on “payment processing” and it pulls the “Payments” section of your spec or documentation into the prompt. Consider leveraging such tools or setting up a rudimentary version (even a simple search in your spec document).\n\nParallelize carefully: Some developers run multiple agent instances in parallel on different tasks (as mentioned earlier with subagents). This can speed up development - e.g., one agent generates code while another simultaneously writes tests, or two features are built concurrently. If you go this route, ensure the tasks are truly independent or clearly separated to avoid conflicts (the spec should note any dependencies). For example, don’t have two agents writing to the same file at once. One workflow is to have an agent generate code and another review it in parallel, or to have separate components built that integrate later. This is advanced usage and can be mentally taxing to manage (as Willison admitted, running multiple agents is surprisingly effective, if mentally exhausting!). Start with at most 2-3 agents to keep things manageable.\n\nVersion control and spec locks: Use Git or your version control of choice to track what the agent does. Good version control habits matter even more with AI assistance. Commit the spec file itself to the repo. This not only preserves history, but the agent can even use git diff or blame to understand changes (LLMs are quite capable of reading diffs). Some advanced agent setups let the agent query the VCS history to see when something was introduced - surprisingly, models can be “fiercely competent at Git”. By keeping your spec in the repo, you allow both you and the AI to track evolution. There are tools (like GitHub Spec Kit mentioned earlier) that integrate spec-driven development into the git workflow - for instance, gating merges on updated specs or generating checklists from spec items. While you don’t need those tools to succeed, the takeaway is to treat the spec like code - maintain it diligently.\n\nCost and speed considerations: Working with large models and long contexts can be slow and expensive. A practical tip is to use model selection and batching smartly. Perhaps use a cheaper/faster model for initial drafts or repetitions, and reserve the most capable (and expensive) model for final outputs or complex reasoning. Some developers use GPT-4 or Claude for planning and critical steps, but offload simpler expansions or refactors to a local model or a smaller API model. If using multiple agents, maybe not all need to be top-tier; a test-running agent or a linter agent could be a smaller model. Also consider throttling context size: don’t feed 20k tokens if 5k will do. As we discussed, more tokens can mean diminishing returns.\n\nMonitor and log everything: In complex agent workflows, logging the agent’s actions and outputs is essential. Check the logs to see if the agent is deviating or encountering errors. Many frameworks provide trace logs or allow printing the agent’s chain-of-thought (especially if you prompt it to think step-by-step). Reviewing these logs can highlight where the spec or instructions might have been misinterpreted. It’s not unlike debugging a program - except the “program” is the conversation/prompt chain. If something weird happens, go back to the spec/instructions to see if there was ambiguity.\n\nLearn and improve: Finally, treat each project as a learning opportunity to refine your spec-writing skill. Maybe you’ll discover that a certain phrasing consistently confuses the AI, or that organizing spec sections in a certain way yields better adherence. Incorporate those lessons into the next spec. The field of AI agents is rapidly evolving, so new best practices (and tools) emerge constantly. Stay updated via blogs (like the ones by Simon Willison, Andrej Karpathy, etc.), and don’t hesitate to experiment.\n\nA spec for an AI agent isn’t “write once, done.” It’s part of a continuous cycle of instructing, verifying, and refining. The payoff for this diligence is substantial: by catching issues early and keeping the agent aligned, you avoid costly rewrites or failures later. As one AI engineer quipped, using these practices can feel like having “an army of interns” working for you, but you have to manage them well. A good spec, continuously maintained, is your management tool.\n\nBefore wrapping up, it’s worth calling out anti-patterns that can derail even well-intentioned spec-driven workflows. The GitHub study of 2,500+ agent files revealed a stark divide: “Most agent files fail because they’re too vague.” Here are the mistakes to avoid:\n\nVague prompts: “Build me something cool” or “Make it work better” gives the agent nothing to anchor on. As Baptiste Studer puts it: “Vague prompts mean wrong results.” Be specific about inputs, outputs, and constraints. “You are a helpful coding assistant” doesn’t work. “You are a test engineer who writes tests for React components, follows these examples, and never modifies source code” does.\n\nOverlong contexts without summarization: Dumping 50 pages of documentation into a prompt and hoping the model figures it out rarely works. Use hierarchical summaries (as discussed in Principle 3) or RAG to surface only what’s relevant. Context length is not a substitute for context quality.\n\nSkipping human review: Willison has a personal rule: “I won’t commit code I couldn’t explain to someone else.” Just because the agent produced something that passes tests doesn’t mean it’s correct, secure, or maintainable. Always review critical code paths. The “house of cards” metaphor applies: AI-generated code can look solid but collapse under edge cases you didn’t test.\n\nConflating vibe coding with production engineering: Rapid prototyping with AI (“vibe coding”) is great for exploration and throwaway projects. But shipping that code to production without rigorous specs, tests, and review is asking for trouble. Osmani distinguishes “vibe coding” from “AI-assisted engineering” - the latter requires the discipline this guide describes. Know which mode you’re in.\n\nIgnoring the “lethal trifecta”: Willison warns of three properties that make AI agents dangerous: speed (they work faster than you can review), non-determinism (same input, different outputs), and cost (encouraging corner-cutting on verification). Your spec and review process must account for all three. Don’t let speed outpace your ability to verify.\n\nMissing the six core areas: If your spec doesn’t cover commands, testing, project structure, code style, git workflow, and boundaries, you’re likely missing something the agent needs. Use the six-area checklist from Section 2 as a sanity check before handing off to the agent.\n\nWriting an effective spec for AI coding agents requires solid software engineering principles combined with adaptation to LLM quirks. Start with clarity of purpose and let the AI help expand the plan. Structure the spec like a serious design document - covering the six core areas and integrating it into your toolchain so it becomes an executable artifact, not just prose. Keep the agent’s focus tight by feeding it one piece of the puzzle at a time (and consider clever tactics like summary TOCs, subagents, or parallel orchestration to handle big specs). Anticipate pitfalls by including three-tier boundaries (Always/Ask first/Never), self-checks, and conformance tests - essentially, teach the AI how to not fail. And treat the whole process as iterative: use tests and feedback to refine both the spec and the code continuously.\n\nFollow these guidelines and your AI agent will be far less likely to “break down” under large contexts or wander off into nonsense.\n\nThis post was formatted using Gemini with images generated using Nano Banana Pro",

The bill passed with unanimous consent — meaning there was no roll-call vote, and no Senator objected to its passage on the floor Tuesday. It’s meant to build on the work of the Take It Down Act, a law that criminalizes the distribution of nonconsensual intimate images (NCII) and requires social media platforms to promptly remove them.\n\nThe passage comes as policymakers around the world have threatened action against X for enabling users to create nonconsensual and sexually suggestive AI images with its Grok chatbot. X owner Elon Musk has shrugged off blame onto the individuals prompting Grok, writing, “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.” But even after pushback, X continued to let users prompt Grok to virtually strip people down.\n\nSenate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), a lead sponsor of the bill, referenced Grok’s nonconsensual undressing in remarks on the Senate floor. “Even after these terrible deepfake, harming images are pointed out to Grok and to X, formerly Twitter, they do not respond. They don’t take the images off of the internet. They don’t come to the rescue of people who are victims,” Durbin said. Though the Take It Down Act, whose takedown provision goes into full force later this year, could have implications for X, the DEFIANCE Act would impact individuals, like those Grok users creating deepfaked nonconsensual intimate imagery.\n\nGovernments around the world are creating new protections against AI-generated nonconsensual images, spurred in part by the recent Grok controversy. The UK, for example, recently pushed up a law that criminalizes the creation of nonconsensual intimate deepfakes.\n\nThe DEFIANCE Act similarly passed the Senate in 2024 following a different nonconsensual deepfake scandal on X. Early that year, sexually explicit AI-generated images of Taylor Swift circulated on the platform. Durbin along with Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and Josh Hawley (R-MO) introduced the bill to expand on a provision in the Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization Act of 2022, which gave people whose non-AI generated intimate images were shared without consent a right to sue. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who has found her own image digitally altered in nonconsensual intimate deepfakes, sponsored the bill in the House. The bill stalled in the House without a vote during the last Congress, requiring the Senate to take it up again this year. Now the ball is again in the House leadership’s court; if they decide to bring the bill to the floor, it will have to pass in order to reach the president’s desk.",

    "description": "The all-electric Toyota Hilux debuts in Europe with more specs to share as the world's first mass-produced midsize pickup truck.",
    "fullText": "The all-electric Hilux debuts in Europe with more specs to share.\n\nIn November of 2025, Toyota revealed the all-new ninth-gen Hilux and along with it, an all-electric version. Now, the automaker just unveiled the Euro-spec version and simultaneously, more detailed specifications.\n\nWhile the introduction of a new generation of the world’s most iconic and popular midsize pickup truck is big news, the bigger news is with the BEV (battery-electric vehicle) variant.\n\nIn addition to being the world’s first mass-produced midsize pickup EV, it’s also proof that Toyota’s not giving up on the controversial powertrain tech.\n\nWhen Toyota revealed the Hilux BEV, key highlights included a dual-electric motor setup with a 59.2 kilowatt-hour battery pack. Engineers said the system could churn out around 350 lb-ft of torque, though they didn’t go much further into detail.\n\nWith the new Euro version out, Toyota confirms the Hilux BEV’s motors produce 151 lb-ft at the front motor and 198 lb-ft at the rear, for a total of around 349 lb-ft of torque.\n\nThe result is a driving range of up to 159 miles on the WLTP rating in off-road conditions. But the distance can increase to up to 236 miles in urban conditions.\n\nIt can still tow and haul. But its payload and towing capacities are less than the diesel-powered version, which is due to the heavy weight of the electric powertrain gear.\n\nWith the more conventional turbo-diesel engine, the Hilux is capable of hauling up to 2,205 pounds and towing up to 7,720 pounds.\n\nBut with BEV, it can only haul up to 1,580 pounds and tow up to 3,350 pounds.\n\nElectric vehicles have recently dropped in both demand and desirability as their time on the market revealed many of their drawbacks. The hype around them dissipated so greatly that many automakers with aggressive electrification strategies pumped the brakes on their strategies.\n\nHowever, some, like Toyota, are still looking to keep electric power around for those who still want it. And the Hilux BEV marks a major stepping stone for the segment. Even if it is very much a small niche.\n\nWhile the specs are solid, they’re not shocking. For instance, many buyers, especially those who need to travel long distances, will find the Hilux BEV’s driving range underwhelming.\n\nBut according to Toyota, the Hilux BEV isn’t really aimed at private consumers who do a lot of driving. Rather, it’s meant for commercial and fleet uses with fixed travel routes.\n\nIn which case, the Hilux BEV may make a lot of sense.\n\nWant to stay up to date on the latest product news and releases? Add Gear Patrol as a preferred source to ensure our independent journalism makes it to the top of your Google search results.",

    "description": "Authorities suspected Ian Alexander Shelton, 30, was having a “mental health crisis” before his disappearance in December",
    "fullText": "Ian Alexander Shelton’s body was recovered from Lake Afton in Kansas more than a month after he went missing\n\n“I want people to remember him as someone who gave up a lot to be with his mom, who’s fighting cancer, and was always there for her when she needed him,” his friend Justin Stroud said\n\nDetectives confirmed that Shelton had been at the lake during the early hours of Dec. 3 and suspected he may have been experiencing a “mental health crisis”\n\nA missing man’s body was recovered from Kansas' Lake Afton more than a month after he reportedly vanished from a night out.\n\nIan Alexander Shelton's remains were recovered on the south side of the lake on the afternoon of Saturday, Jan. 10, the Sedgwick County Sheriff’s Office said.\n\nHis cause of death has not yet been confirmed.\n\nAuthorities first sought the public’s help with locating Shelton, 30, on Dec. 5 after he was reported missing, according to a news release.\n\nShelton was last seen leaving the Let’s Roll Seneca bowling alley at 9:30 p.m. local time on Dec. 2 and was considered endangered because of the cold weather and the clothes he was wearing.\n\nDetectives searched the Lake Afton area on Dec. 6 and, two days later, confirmed that Shelton had been at the lake during the early hours of Dec. 3. They suspected he may have been experiencing a “mental health crisis” at the time of his disappearance.\n\n\"We don't show any other signs right now to think that there was any foul play … I know there's been some speculation on social media about that,” Sedgwick County Sheriff's Capt. Matthew Lynch told ABC affiliate KAKE last month, noting that Shelton seemed to be with a woman at the lake.\n\n\"We are trying to preserve evidence or statements that we get in case this does turn into a criminal investigation,” Lynch said then.\n\nOn Dec. 9, the sheriff’s office led a “large-scale coordinated search of approximately 3.5 square miles in and around Lake Afton Park,” according to a news release.\n\nBut after finding no signs of Shelton after days of search efforts, organized operations were concluded on Dec. 10.\n\n“It’s just been like holding your breath for as long as you can, hoping for air,” Justin Stroud, a close friend, told KAKE of what it was like searching for Shelton alongside more of his loved ones.\n\n“We met when he was 13. I’m a little bit older than him, but we met through a really close friend of ours, and we hit it off right away,” Stroud said.\n\nAccording to the sheriff’s office, Sedgwick County firefighters were finally able to recover Shelton’s body on Saturday when an individual reported an unidentified object “floating in the water.”\n\n“This case remains an open and active investigation,“ officials said. “The Sedgwick County Sheriff’s Office extends its condolences to the family and friends of Ian Alexander Shelton during this difficult time.”\n\nStroud has remembered his longtime friend for his positive and supportive personality — especially when it came to supporting his mom during her journey with stage four cancer.\n\n“He was an amazing person. There’s not anybody that knew Ian that would ever have anything bad to say about him,” Stroud told KAKE. “He lit up rooms when he walked into them.”\n\n“I want people to remember him as someone who gave up a lot to be with his mom, who’s fighting cancer, and was always there for her when she needed him,” he added.\n\nShelton’s mother, Stacy, also paid tribute to him on social media.\n\n“I always hoped that they would have been able to spend years together playing guitar,” she wrote of her late husband and son on Facebook. “I'm comforted to know that Ian is with his Mark making music once again.”\n\nIn a separate post, she added, “I love you son.”",

    "fullText": "Global oil prices surged on Tuesday as markets reacted to the escalating drone strikes at the Novorossiysk terminal, which handles roughly 2% of the world's daily supply. The disruption to the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) infrastructure, a vital artery for Kazakh exports managed by Western majors like Chevron and Shell, raised immediate fears of a prolonged supply squeeze.\n\nWhile Brent was trading at $65.13, up 1.9%.\n\nTwo oil tankers waiting to load crude from some of Kazakhstan’s biggest oilfields were hit by drones at the marine terminal of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) near Novorossiysk on Russia’s Black Sea coast, sources told Reuters.\n\nThe Caspian Pipeline Consortium Marine Terminal, a major oil export facility close to Novorossiysk, handles most of Kazakhstan’s crude oil exports, as well as some Russian crude supply.\n\nThe Delta Harmony and the Matilda tankers were waiting to load crude from Tengizchevroil and Karachaganak, respectively, according to Reuters’ sources.\n\nTengizchevroil, operating the supergiant Tengiz oilfield in Kazakhstan, is managed by a consortium led by U.S. oil and gas supermajor Chevron. Karachaganak, another giant field in Kazakhstan, is operated by a consortium comprising Shell, Chevron, and Italy’s Eni, among others.\n\nDrone attacks at or near the CPC terminal have intensified in recent weeks and have affected the loading and departure schedules of Kazakhstan’s crude cargoes.\n\nKazakhstan’s oil output fell sharply at the end of November and early December after damage at the CPC export terminal disrupted flows. Output dropped in the first two days of December after storms and structural damage limited loading capacity at the Black Sea terminal, prompting producers to scale back throughput as storage filled.\n\nKazakhstan relies on the CPC for roughly 80% of its crude exports.\n\nThe disruption came at a sensitive moment for Kazakhstan, which was attempting to stabilize production following repeated CPC interruptions earlier in 2025.\n\nOil has continued to flow, but at lower rates, while Kazakhstan sought to re-route some exports away from the Black Sea to keep supply relatively steady.\n\nCPC operates the pipeline from the Caspian coast in northwest Kazakhstan to the Novorossiysk port, which handles 80% of Kazakhstan’s crude exports from giant oilfields operated by international oil firms.\n\nAffiliates of Chevron and ExxonMobil are also minority shareholders in CPC, with the Russian Federation as its largest shareholder with a 24% stake.",

It also plans to invest in leadership development, training, and performance initiatives to empower employees and franchises.\n\n“Our focus as we accelerate our growth is to resonate with the next generation of consumers while preserving the classic Americana feel and signature experience that has made the brand beloved in more than 40 countries,” TGI Fridays CEO Ray Blanchette said in a press release.\n\nThis is a turnaround from how things have been recently for the popular restaurant chain.\n\nAs previously reported, in 2024, due to declining sales because of debt that happened following the COVID-19 pandemic, it filed for bankruptcy.\n\nWhen it filed, it reported $37 million in debt and less than $6 million in available cash.\n\nAt the beginning of 2024, the chain had reduced to about 270 locations, only to continue to spiral down even further.\n\nTo get back on track, the chain came up with a new strategy to attract more customers that included house-made sauces and hand-cut steaks.\n\nBut it didn’t make a difference as TGIF still went on to close dozens of locations.\n\nAs of 2025, the chain had 79 locations nationwide.

    "fullText": "White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller drew sharp condemnation Tuesday over a message he sent to Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers during an interview with Fox News host Will Cain.\n\nMiller asserted that ICE agents have “federal immunity in the conduct of your duties” and declared that anyone who touches or obstructs them is “committing a felony.”\n\nLegal experts and commentators pushed back on social media, stressing that prosecuting federal agents is possible, even if it’s often difficult, as a recent HuffPost report explained.\n\nOther critics called Miller’s overall tone “utterly chilling” and a “greenlight for abuse” that amounted to declaring “open season” for ICE agents “on immigrants AND citizens alike” and encouraged officers to “go and spread violence and terror.”\n\nNews: Border Czar Frantically Backpedals After Breaking With Kristi Noem Over ICE Shooting\n\nMiller’s remarks came amid heightened scrutiny of ICE following the killing of Renee Good in Minneapolis.\n\nThe anti-immigration hardliner’s full comments were as follows:\n\n“To all ICE officers: You have federal immunity in the conduct of your duties. and anybody who lays a hand on you or tries to stop you or tries to obstruct you is committing a felony. You have immunity to perform your duties, and no one — no city official, no state official, no illegal alien, no leftist agitator or domestic insurrectionist — can prevent you from fulfilling your legal obligations and duties.

    "fullText": "Analysts have flagged the risk of an oil price shock as geopolitical tensions escalate.\n\nOil prices have climbed 10% in the last week amid tensions between the US and Venezuela and unrest in Iran.\n\nHigher oil prices could stoke inflation and lead stocks and bonds to sell off, one economist said.\n\nSoaring oil prices. Hot inflation. Turmoil in markets.\n\nThat was a dire combination the US economy saw in the 1970s, but analysts say that the risks of another oil price shock — a situation where oil prices abruptly surge and set off a domino effect of negative consequences in markets and the economy —are on the rise as geopolitical conflict escalates.\n\nOil prices spiked in recent weeks as the US conducted its raid on Venezuela and threatened to take military action in Iran — two of the world's largest crude producers.\n\nMarch contracts for Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose 10% in the last week, and jumped by as much as 3% to trade above $65 a barrel on Tuesday. It's the highest price for Brent since November.\n\nShould Brent oil hit $80 a barrel, that would probably constitute an oil price shock, according to José Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers.\n\nIn that scenario, Torres said he believes bonds and stocks would sell off in tandem, as higher energy prices could stoke inflation, which could weigh on economic growth. Higher inflation could also mean the Fed has less room to cut interest rates down the line, a major catalyst that has pushed risk assets higher in the past year.\n\n\"Definitely there's risk for an oil price shock, especially with stocks coming up for three really robust years,\" Torres told Business Insider, referring to the back-to-back years of double-digit gains for the S&P 500.\n\nMatt Gertken, the chief geopolitical strategist at BCA Research, said that recent tensions in Iran have raised the odds of a \"massive global oil supply shock\" to around 40%. Should Iran's regime fall and conflict in the region increase, that could result in a \"significant loss\" in oil production around the region, he wrote in a note to clients this week.\n\n\"Global and US equities are exposed to a correction in the near term given overvalued and overbought conditions and escalating geopolitical risk at the moment,\" Gertken added.\n\nAnalysts at Deutsche Bank also flagged the risk of the market experiencing an oil shock this year.\n\n\"A positive supply shock to oil prices would materially impact inflation expectations and inflation risks,\" the bank wrote in a recent client note, calling the scenario a key risk to their economic outlook.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Health secretary issues invitation in push for UK to consider copying landmark restrictions in Australia\n\nWes Streeting has asked Jonathan Haidt, a bestselling author and high-profile advocate of banning social media for under-16s, to speak to his officials in his push for the UK to consider following a landmark ban in Australia.\n\nThe health secretary has invited Haidt to address an event with staff, charities and MPs after the prime minister, Keir Starmer, said he was open to stricter limits for young people.\n\nHaidt came to prominence after writing Anxious Generation, in which he argued that widespread use of smartphones had caused a mental health crisis for young people.\n\nHe has become a global activist for stricter rules, including bans on social media for under-16s and on smartphones in schools.\n\nStarmer said on Monday he would consider all options in curbing young people’s access to social media. “We are looking at Australia, there are different ways you can enforce it,” he told a meeting of Labour MPs.\n\nThe prime minister also addressed the use of phones in school, adding: “No one thinks you should have phones in schools.”\n\nThose comments reflected a change of heart from Starmer, who previously said a social media ban would be difficult to police and could push teenagers toward the dark web.\n\nFleur Anderson, a Labour MP who has been campaigning for stricter curbs, said: “I was really pleased to hear that the prime minister is looking seriously at the Australian model. It is time we regulated this and gave young people the protections they need.”\n\nStarmer’s words reflect a growing Westminster consensus in favour of such a move – one which has been provoked in part by the row over X’s AI tool allowing users to generate sexualised images of women and children.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ed Davey of the Liberal Democrats became the latest party leader to leave the door open to a social media ban for young people after a similar move by Nigel Farage of Reform UK.\n\nKemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, announced on Sunday she would enact a ban if elected prime minister, and would push for one from opposition. Andy Burnham, the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, has also said he would support such a move.\n\nGovernment ministers are split between those who are enthusiastic supporters of curbs on social media and those who have concerns about how they would be implemented and what the impact would be on teenagers.\n\nStreeting has been one of those most in favour of taking stronger action, telling the BBC last week: “Sometimes I feel like my concentration span suffers because of doom scrolling and the way in which information is served up in increasingly short, bite-size chunks. And I worry about what that means for the development and the cognitive development of a generation of children and young people.”\n\nAs well as the event with Haidt, Streeting has asked officials to look into the details of Australia’s ban, which came into force at the start of the year.\n\nThe technology secretary, Liz Kendall, is also understood to be looking at the Australian policy, though she has not commissioned a team to actively examine it.\n\nAllies say she is listening to warnings from charities such as the NSPCC that an outright ban could drive young people toward the dark web and undermine attempts to teach them how to use social media responsibly.\n\nBridget Phillipson, the education secretary, and Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, share similar concerns, according to government insiders.\n\nNandy commissioned a survey of 14,000 young people that found most did not want an outright ban. She told the Guardian last year: “The challenge with banning social media is enforcement. Are we really saying as a country that we’re going to start prosecuting under-18s for using social media?”\n\nSenior government sources say they are concerned about the possibility that Labour peers will back a Conservative-led attempt to amend the children’s wellbeing and schools bill to include a ban for under-16s.\n\nThe amendment, proposed by the former minister John Nash, has been signed by the Labour peer Luciana Berger and the Liberal Democrat Floella Benjamin.\n\nGovernment officials believe that enough Labour peers could vote for or abstain on that amendment to see it pass when it is debated next week. The issue would then come to the Commons, where several Labour MPs could join the Tories in supporting it.",

    "fullText": "Workers will be able to use other identification for right to work, meaning digital form not mandatory\n\nMinisters have rolled back plans for a central element of the proposed digital ID plans, leaving open the possibility that people will be able to use other forms of identification to prove their right to work.\n\nThis will mean that the IDs, announced to some controversy in September, will no longer be mandatory for working-age people, given that the only planned obligatory element was to prove the right to work in the UK.\n\nWhile officials said this was not a U-turn, just a tweak before a detailed consultation on how the system will function, it will be viewed as the latest in a series of policy changes, including on business rates and inheritance tax for farmers.\n\nWhen Keir Starmer announced the proposal for digital IDs by 2029 they were billed as voluntary, with the exception that they would be mandatory for people to show they were legally allowed to work.\n\nThis was portrayed by the prime minister as a main benefit of the plan. “Digital ID is an enormous opportunity for the UK,” he said. “It will make it tougher to work illegally in this country, making our borders more secure.”\n\nPeople will still be required to verify their ID digitally, by a process still to be finished, but this could involve existing documents such as a passport. The hope is that this would crack down on illegal working while avoiding the controversy of an in effect compulsory ID system.\n\nIt is understood that one of the motivations for the change was to allow people who wanted to use digital ID to do so, while avoiding the PR hurdle of a mandatory element. As one official put it: “We will no longer have the conspiracy nonsense about state control.”\n\nA government spokesperson said: “We are committed to mandatory digital right to work checks. We have always been clear that details on the digital ID scheme will be set out following a full public consultation which will launch shortly.\n\n“Digital ID will make everyday life easier for people, ensuring public services are more personal, joined up, and effective, while also remaining inclusive.”\n\nThe Conservatives called the move “yet another humiliating U-turn from the government”.\n\nMike Wood, a shadow Cabinet Office minister, said: “What was sold as a tough measure to tackle illegal working is now set to become yet another costly, ill-thought-out experiment abandoned at the first sign of pressure from Labour’s backbenches.”\n\nLisa Smart, the Liberal Democrats’ Cabinet Office spokesperson, said: “No 10 must be bulk ordering motion sickness tablets at this rate to cope with all their U-turns.\n\n“It was clear right from the start this was a proposal doomed to failure, that would have cost obscene amounts of taxpayers money to deliver absolutely nothing.\n\n“The government now needs to confirm that the billions of pounds earmarked for their mandatory digital ID scheme will be spent on the NHS and frontline policing instead.”\n\nA government source said the revised plans would not change the main principle of the original proposal, in which checks for eligibility to work were to be made tougher, in line with systems in other countries.\n\nCurrently, they said, many were based on employers seeing paper copies of documents, whereas under the new system it was likely to involve a digital check of a passport or e-visa.",

    "description": "Top 10: The fastest aircraft ever made",
    "fullText": "Other than spacecraft, aircraft are the fastest vehicles, leaving cars and bikes for dust.\n\nWe take a look at the ten fastest planes ever flown. Though some uncrewed aircraft (like the X-43) have flown faster, they somehow fail to stir the imagination in the way an aircraft carrying a pilot does, so we will look at true crewed aircraft only. We have given the speed in mph and Mach. Mach is a measure of speed relative to local conditions; at sea level sound travels at around 760mph, (so, at sea level Mach 1 is around 760 mph) as you get higher the air gets thinner and sound is slower. Let’s meet the 10 fastest planes…\n\nBased on the earlier Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25, the Mikoyan MiG-31 was designed as a defensive interceptor to shoot down enemy cruise missiles and bombers from a long distance. For the mission of defending a very large country from bombers, extreme top speed is more important than agility. The MiG-31 is a massive machine, weighing 46,000kg fully loaded. Much of the weight is accounted for by the huge amount of fuel required for the extremely powerful engines required to get the MiG-31 to a top speed of 3000 km/h (1900 mph) equivalent to Mach 2.83 at 21,500 m (70,500 ft).\n\nThe MiG-31 has two turbofan engines, which when deploying afterburner (fuel burnt towards the rear of the engine to increase thrust) have a combined thrust of 68,000 lb ft (equivalent to 304kN). The engine is the Soloviev D-30. The MiG-31 first flew in 1975 and entered service in 1981. Other than the two ancient, and barely flyable, MiG-25s in Syria, the MiG-31 is the fastest (known) crewed aircraft flying anywhere in the world in 2024. Though capable of Mach 2.83, the MiG-31 is limited to Mach 1.5 in peacetime to preserve engine and airframe life.\n\nThe Ye-150 series were wildly-high-performance heavy interceptors. They could out-drag and out-climb any fighter in the world, and they also looked exceptionally mean. Despite taking its first flight as long ago as 1959, the Ye-150 could reach an astonishing Mach 2.65 (some sources claim even higher speeds of Mach 2.85, or 3030 km/h) and could ascend to altitudes above 69,000 feet (21,031m). The series of four experimental fighter-prototypes was built in an effort to create a new, highly automated fighter to defend the Soviet Union against a proliferating Western threat (including supersonic bombers like the B-58, then in development). To catch and destroy these fast, high-flying intruders, the interceptor was to be automatically steered under the guidance of ground radars before engaging its own cutting-edge detection and weapons systems.\n\nBut it was a case of too much too soon; the ferociously exacting requirements for the electronics, missiles and powerplant were too demanding, and each suffered severe delays and development problems. What could have been the best interceptor in the world was ultimately cancelled in 1962. However, before it was cancelled it snatched the official world air speed record at 1665.9 mph (2681km/h). The pilot was  Col. Georgi Mosolov and the record was achieved on 31 October 1959. The record lasted a mere six weeks before being beaten by a US F-106 (with a higher record speed but lower top speed in unofficial tests).\n\nThe F-111 bomber was the result of a failed project to build a fighter-bomber capable of serving both the United States Air Force and Navy as both a fighter-interceptor and a fast bomber. The naval fighter version for aircraft carriers, the F-111B, proved too heavy and sluggish to serve and was cancelled in favour of the F-14 Tomcat. Open any aircraft reference book or website and you’ll read that the F-111 had a top speed somewhere between Mach 2.2 and Mach 2.5. But when the Hush-Kit site spoke to F-111 pilots and navigators he found that this official number is rather modest.  Aardvark Weapon System Officer Jim Rotramel noted, “There was NO specified maximum speed.”\n\n“What we had was a heat sensor on the windscreen. When the sensor got hot enough, it caused a caution light to illuminate…warning was that if the timer reached five minutes, the windscreen would melt. I think the fastest anyone ever claimed to have gotten was Mach 2.91. In any event, no one ever saw the jet stop accelerating—everyone decided to back off before testing the egg timer…” Following this interview, other former F-111 aircrew came forward claiming even greater speeds achieved, some as high as Mach 3.2 (we’ll stick to Jim’s already high claim). The F-111 was capable of such speeds due to the extreme sweepback angle possible with its variable ‘swing-wings’, its jet air intake design, general slimness and the type of engine.\n\nUntil the late 1950s everyone knew that each successive generation of bombers was faster and higher flying than the last. They had to be, as the fighters tasked with blowing them out of the sky were getting ever faster and higher flying. The next step was Mach 3, three times the speed of sound – or around 2000 mph, at 75,000ft. The resultant aircraft was arguably the most impressive machine that ever flew: a sleek 56-metre-long white dart with a delta wing with outer sections that folded down by 65 degrees during high-speed flight. Despite its beauty, the B-70 fleet was designed to annihilate hundreds of thousands of civilians or highly protected nuclear missile silos with free-fall nuclear bombs.\n\nIt was hoped that the bomber’s performance would render it invulnerable to manned interception, but it was soon clear that ever more potent surface-to-air missiles were a real threat. Intercontinental ballistic missiles were the future, but the XB-70 project had momentum. It became a political ‘football’ kicked around by the most powerful men in America, including Richard Nixon, John F Kennedy and Robert McNamara, all adopting pro or anti positions as suited their needs. Kennedy was pro-B-70 in the 1960 election campaign but changed his mind. The aircraft was cancelled, but did perform some research work for NASA.\n\nIn 1947, the Bell X-1 broke the sound barrier, and a mere eight years later the X-2 was going three times faster, and was the very first aircraft to go faster than Mach 3. It was rocket-powered, with a swept-wing. It was launched from beneath a Boeing B-50 mothership. The project started as early as 1945, with the Bell Aircraft Corporation, the United States Army Air Force and the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) teaming up to study the aerodynamic issues of extremely fast and high flying.\n\nTo withstand the high skin temperatures the X-2 used stainless steel and K-monel (a copper-nickel alloy) in its construction. The X-2s were powered by a two-chamber Curtiss-Wright XLR25 throttleable liquid-fueled rocket engine. Once the rocket had used its fuel out the X-2 made an unpowered glide back to land. Capt. Milburn G. “Mel” Apt became the first person fly faster than three times the speed of sound on Sept. 27 1956. He reached 2094 mph (Mach 3.196) in the Bell X-2, but tragedy soon followed. Apt performed a sharp turn, causing the aircraft to tumble uncontrollably. Though Apt escaped from the aircraft, he was killed as he hit the ground in the escape capsule.\n\nThe Mikoyan MiG-25 was a 1960s Soviet aircraft conceived with several roles in mind. It needed to be fast enough to catch the US A-5 and (later cancelled) XB-70 bombers, as well as perform the reconnaissance and recce-nuclear-bomber role. For these roles, it was intended to rely on high speed and high altitudes to succeed. Whereas the US SR-71 Blackbird relied on exotic technology, fuel, engines and materials to reach high speeds, the Soviet Union used a largely stainless steel construction to withstand the huge aircraft skin temperatures and very large engines. This simple solution was far cheaper but meant it was slower and couldn’t achieve tri-sonic speed for very long.\n\nFor most of its life, it was used in the interceptor and reconnaissance roles, and it was in the latter role that it was caught on Israeli radar flying at Mach 3.2. This was well above the recommended normal limits of Mach 2.83 and is said to have wrecked the engines. In 1976 Soviet Air Force fighter pilot, Viktor Belenko, defected to Japan in a MiG-25. Before the aircraft was returned it was hurriedly assessed in detail by Western intelligence agencies. The MiG-25 had been much feared, but studying the aircraft revealed it had far lower tech than expected.\n\nProduced in huge secrecy, the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird was a technological marvel that seemingly arrived from space. The sleek alien looks of the SR-71 were utterly appropriate for a machine many years ahead of its time. The Blackbird was penned by the great aircraft designer Kelly Johnson, in Lockheed’s legendary Skunk Works advanced projects department. The SR-71 could travel over 33 miles every minute. Key to the Blackbird’s high speed were its unusual engines and their relationship with their inlet shock, its special fuel, the aircraft’s low drag shape and sharp wing sweep, its use of titanium, and its cooling systems.\n\nMach 3.3 is the traditional quoted top speed of the SR-71 but more recent articles have put it at Mach 3.5 (and in some cases Mach 3.75). We’ll stick to the quote given directly to us by a SR-71 pilot, which is that it was fully tested up to Mach 3.3 (though it is said to have been ground-tested to Mach 3.6) The Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird supplied the US with vital intelligence for much of the Cold War, proving invulnerable to interception. It is the fastest crewed aircraft – and fastest jet – to ever see military service and retains a cult bewitched by the mystique of this charismatic futuristic aeroplane.\n\nThe swiftest fighter aircraft ever created, the Lockheed YF-12 was a prototype for an advanced United States Air Force interceptor able to fly incredibly fast, with a belly full of ultra-long range AIM-47 air-to-air missiles to knock out Soviet bomber threatening the United States. Though this sounds formidable, there were several flaws with the concept, one being that the YF-12 with its many exotic features, could not be quickly scrambled. It took much too long to prepare the aircraft for flight, a bad quality in an aircraft intended to intercept enemy bombers at a moment’s notice.\n\nAnother issue was its use of special JP-7 fuel. This meant it could not be air refuelled by normal tanking aircraft and would have to rely on a special fleet of tankers of Boeing KC-135Qs. The SR-71 would require 56 KC-135Qs, a hugely expensive effort – a force of F-12s would have required far more. It was clear that a slower more conventional aircraft with long-range missiles would be a far easier and more effective option and the exciting F-12 was cancelled. Though cancelled, much of the long-range missile and radar technology developed for the A-12 would go on to inform the later Grumman F-14 Tomcat.\n\n‘Project Oxcart’ was a highly classified project to develop a reconnaissance aircraft for the US, that thanks to high speed and altitude performance would be immune to enemy interception by either fighters or surface-to-air missiles. It would also pioneer the yet-to-be-named concept of radar stealth. The two entries above are essentially the same aircraft, but the single-seat A-12 was the first family member. The A-12 was beyond state-of-the-art, with many technologies required to be invented to make it possible.\n\nAt 30 metres, the A-12 was very long for a single-seat aircraft. It was designed for prolonged flight at Mach 3, so required titanium in its construction to survive a skin temperature reaching between 300 and 400 degrees. Such high-speed flight was enough to lengthen the aircraft, and it would only contract again was cool. Though its maximum speed is often stated as Mach 3.35, it is likely that the A-12 was capable of even faster speeds with Mach 3.6 very possible. It flew operational missions for a short time before being replaced by the twin-seat and considerably more capable SR-71 Blackbird.\n\nThe record for the fastest speed for a crewed aircraft has stood for an astonishing 57 years. The North American X-15 was a research aircraft built to explore extremes of speed and altitude. The X-15 reached an astonishing 4,519mph Heat resistance came from the use of heat-resistant nickel alloy (Inconel-X 750). Earlier flights used the XLR11 rocket engine which used ethyl alcohol and liquid oxygen. The majority of flights (175 of 199) used the XLR99 which employed anhydrous ammonia and liquid oxygen as propellant.\n\nThe X-15 was built to research piloted hypersonic (speeds above Mach 1) flight within and outside the Earth’s atmosphere. Lessons from the X-15 contributed to the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo piloted spaceflight programmes as well as the later Space Shuttle programme. The X-15 did not take off from a runway but was instead launched from beneath the wing of a modified B-52 Stratofortress bomber NB-52. This saved fuel, something the rocket engine burnt at a prodigious rate. The X-15 was air-launched at about 45,000 and a speed of 500 mph. The rocket engine provided thrust for the 80 to 120 seconds. Three aircraft were built and flew a total of 199 flights. Flying above 80km altitude, the pilots met qualification as astronauts.\n\nFollow Joe Coles on Substack, Twitter X  or Blue Sky.

    "fullText": "The family of a Utah teenager says he has “unexpectedly” died after he lost his parents, two sisters and a brother during what authorities said was a murder-suicide that unfolded about one year ago.\n\nSha Reh, who “miraculously survived” the December 2024 tragedy, passed on Sunday, January 11 at his aunt and uncle’s home, his extended family said in a statement shared on a GoFundMe page, which was created to support funeral and memorial services for him.\n\nReh, 19, died of “natural causes,” his family and the president of a church Reh attended, a branch of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, told Fox 13.\n\nReh was the only member of his immediate family who survived the harrowing ordeal at his West City Valley home on December 17, 2024, according to authorities, the TV station reported.\n\nHis father, Dae Reh, was accused of shooting his mother, siblings and Sha before Dae died by suicide, police said, according to Fox 13. Sha was blinded by the shooting and hospitalized with a severe brain injury.\n\n“Despite losing his vision in both eyes, and over the course of the past 13 months, Sha Reh overcame numerous obstacles on his pathway to healing,” his extended family said in their statement.\n\nTeen Shot, Killed by Girlfriend’s Stepbrother While Making Christmas Cookies at Her House\n\nSha was attending Granger High School at the time of the shooting, KUTV reported.\n\nIn January 2025, he enrolled in the Utah School for the Deaf and Blind, according to his extended family.\n\nThere, his family said he “learned to communicate in Braille and live independently.”\n\nIn the week leading to his death, Sha started his first week of undergraduate studies at the University of Utah, according to the GoFundMe page.\n\nSha dreamed of attending college and had plans of pursuing law school, his family said.\n\nIn a statement, according to Fox 13, the Utah State Board of Education said it “extends its sincere condolences to the family, friends, and educators mourning the passing of Sha Reh.”\n\n“Sha Reh was part of Utah’s education community, and his determination to continue his education in the face of profound challenges was recognized by those who knew him,” the statement added. “Our thoughts are with all who are grieving this loss.\"\n\nSha was the oldest of his siblings, who were ages 2, 8, and 11 when they were killed in the December 2024 family shooting, Fox 13 reported. Sha, who was 17 at the time, was shot in the head.\n\nThe family of Sha’s mother, Bu Meh, said in a statement that she and her husband had come to the U.S. with their family after leaving Myanmar and staying at a refugee camp in Thailand more than 10 years ago, according to the TV station.\n\n\"After moving into their own home and finally enjoying a level of prosperity far beyond the nightmare of their former country or the refugee camp in Thailand in which they lived for the season, and for reasons that we cannot comprehend, her husband robbed her and their children of that security and their very lives,” Bu Meh’s family said.\n\nA Month Before Their Murder-Suicide, a Wyoming Woman Predicted Her Ex-Boyfriend Would Kill Her\n\nIn the statement on Sha’s death, his extended family thanked Salt Lake County first responders, local police and a medical examiner’s office for supporting Sha in the wake of the family tragedy.\n\n“While we are devastated at the news of his death, the knowledge of the joy of his reunion with his family exceeds our pain,” the statement said. “He was among those who were once blind, but now can see. He has a perfect vision of his and his family’s eternity, and his home is now with them.”\n\n“Caring for him and watching him grow and regain his independence has been a labor of love for our family,” the statement added.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available.

It now holds stakes in five joint ventures with Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA.\n\nThe company — owned by a unit of the Russian Ministry of Economic Development — said on Tuesday that the assets were acquired at full market value and approved by Venezuelan regulators.\n\nRoszarubezhneft's statement came as Venezuela's oil sector faces fresh uncertainty after the recent US raid that resulted in the capture of deposed Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nAfter the operation, President Donald Trump said the US could run Venezuela and touted plans for American oil companies to invest in the South American country's vast but rundown oil sector.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has not commented publicly on the operation in Venezuela. Moscow's relationship with Caracas includes deep energy ties — a key pillar of Russia's economy — alongside defense and diplomatic cooperation.\n\nThe Russian foreign ​ministry has called for Maduro's release and for dialogue between the US and Venezuela.\n\nInvestors are watching whether the tensions spill over into energy flows.\n\nGlobal oil prices have been weighed down in recent years by ample supply and slowing demand growth.\n\nBut analysts say geopolitical risks are rising, with Venezuela and renewed tensions involving Iran back in focus.\n\nSome analysts warn that the risk of an oil price shock — a sudden surge in prices that can ripple through markets and the global economy — is increasing as geopolitical conflicts intensify.",

    "fullText": "Saks Global has declared bankruptcy.\n\nThe owner of Saks Fifth Avenue and other iconic luxury department stores filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Tuesday in the Southern District of Texas. Each of Saks Global's marquee brands — it also owns Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman — is a luxury retailing giant founded more than a century ago.\n\nThe bankruptcy filing showed that Saks Global owes millions to the biggest names in luxury, including over $136 million to Chanel, $59 million to Gucci's parent company, Kering, and $33 million to Michael Kors' parent company, Capri Holdings.\n\nThe fall of the high-end department store parent — which Business Insider recently detailed in a deep-dive — has been anticipated for months amid signs that its 2024 deal to acquire Neiman Marcus, financed by $2.2 billion in high-interest bonds, has left it struggling financially.\n\nThe $2.7 billion deal, which included investments from Amazon and Salesforce, was intended to strengthen legacy brands by providing them with scale and creating efficiencies. Instead, it left the company burdened by hefty interest payments and unable to pay vendors.\n\nMetrick stepped down as CEO in early January after a roughly three-decade career with the company and was replaced by then-executive chairman Richard Baker.\n\nSome vendors, who told Business Insider they were not paid on the schedule meant to start in July, began shunning the luxury retailer as the holiday season approached.\n\n\"They must do something very quickly to rectify this situation in the market, or they will not have a spring season,\" Gary Wassner, the CEO of Hilldun Corp., which acts as a sort of guarantor or insurer for brands, told Business Insider in late December.\n\nAt the time of the interview, Hilldun, which works with about 140 brands shipping to Saks, had stopped backing shipments to the retailer until payments resumed at the agreed-upon terms.\n\nSaks has recently faced multiple lawsuits from vendors accusing the company of failing to pay for merchandise that was sold and delivered.\n\nOne New York state lawsuit filed in October by Jovani Fashion, a dressmaker that \"Real Housewives of New York\" star Luann de Lesseps helped popularize, alleged that Saks owed it nearly $300,000. Saks' attorneys have denied the allegations in court papers.\n\nThe Tuesday bankruptcy filing showed that Saks Global had between 10,001 and 25,000 creditors. It also had between $1 billion and $10 billion in assets and the same in liabilities.",

    "title": "One thing that might get workers to embrace AI? The 4-day workweek.",
    "description": "Adopting AI has been a struggle at some companies. Embracing a four-day workweek might help get more workers on board, say these authors.",
    "fullText": "Bosses, if you're struggling to get your people excited about AI, here's one idea: Embrace the four-day workweek.\n\nSharing some of AI's promised efficiency gains with employees — by letting them work fewer hours, not just get more done — could help get workers on board with a technology that some fear might ultimately replace them, authors of a new book advocating for a shorter workweek told Business Insider.\n\nLetting workers put in four days' work for five days' pay would be one way to \"share the rewards\" of innovation and technological advancement, said Jared Lindzon, a coauthor of the book \"Do \n\nWhen it comes to AI, giving workers more time away from their jobs could make it more likely they'd get behind the technology \"because they're getting part of that benefit,\" rather than standing in the way of it, he said.\n\nJoe O'Connor, Lindzon's coauthor, said that when it comes to discussions about AI in the workplace, the conversation among workers often turns to fears of job cuts.\n\nAnxiety about AI-induced layoffs might be one reason rolling out the technology has proven difficult for some companies. In an early 2025 survey of business leaders in eight countries from the IT company Kyndryl, 45% of CEOs said their workers were resisting the technology.\n\n\"Cultural resistance and emotional friction\" are the biggest impediments to AI adoption, Boston Consulting Group reported in 2025. That's unwelcome news for C-suite decision-makers eager to ratchet up efficiency. One in three companies is pumping at least $25 million into AI, according to BCG.\n\nBusiness leaders have, at times, publicly expressed their frustration over some workers' foot-dragging.\n\nCoinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said in 2025 that he'd gone \"rogue\" in firing some workers at the crypto exchange who didn't adopt AI after being told to do so. The head of the software company IgniteTech has, meanwhile, lamented that \"changing minds was harder than adding skills.\" In recent years, the firm cut nearly eight in 10 workers after they failed to quickly embrace AI.\n\nNurturing the productivity gains that many leaders seek will often require people to perform different kinds of work — especially as AI takes over some tasks, O'Connor said. He expects that demand for creativity, judgment, critical thinking, and adaptability will increase and that those \"fundamentally human\" traits won't be fostered by simply moving faster or working longer, he said.\n\n\"It's going to be more about maximizing people's energy, maximizing people's motivation, maximizing people's well-being and recovery,\" O'Connor said. A four-day workweek could promote those things, he said.\n\nThe idea that AI could allow people to work less isn't new. For years, the technology's advocates have said it could free up humans to do more of what they love, while handing off the grunt work to bots. The CEO of startup Mechanize, for example, says the company's aim is to automate every job.\n\nThat notion has led some of the biggest corporate luminaries to predict that working hours could plummet as AI adoption increases. Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates has said that time on the clock might shrink to two days, while JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon has said workweeks of 3.5 days could become a thing.\n\nEven Nvidia's Jensen Huang — known for regularly putting in 14-hour days at the chipmaker and working on holidays — has said he could see the tech allowing for more time away from the office.\n\nPoliticians have weighed in, too. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, citing efficiency gains from technology such as AI, introduced legislation in 2024 to trim the standard workweek to 32 hours.\n\nThere hasn't yet been widespread adoption of the four-day workweek, likely in part because employers wield more power in many parts of the job market. O'Connor said that while adoption of four-day setups was lower in 2025 than in 2023, when far more workers were job-hopping, more employers are opting for shorter weeks than before the pandemic upended norms about work.\n\nUmesh Ramakrishnan, cofounder of the executive search and leadership advisory firm Kingsley Gate, told Business Insider that many leaders, himself included, would want to harness AI's productivity gains to boost a business's top and bottom lines.\n\n\"If you have a day to spare, get me more revenue, get me more profit,\" he said, adding that while it might sound \"heartless,\" that's simply how business works.\n\nYet, Lindzon said, asking workers to be 20% more effective — the equivalent of a single day in a standard workweek — so that they might benefit from that boost is likely to be more effective than asking them to do it for the good of the company.\n\n\"It completely changes the conversation from a 'You have to do this' to 'We get to do this together,'\" he said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

    "fullText": "Silicon Valley is raising its standards for talent.\n\nAdrien Friggeri spent over a decade combined at Meta — including back when it was called Facebook — with stints at Michael Bloomberg's Hawkfish and Clubhouse as well. Now, he works as a partner software engineer at Microsoft, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nThe consequences of underperforming are \"more drastic\" now than they were 10 years ago, Friggeri said on \"The Peterman Pod.\"\n\nIn an email to Business Insider, Friggeri wrote that there is less \"organizational 'slack'\" and higher expectations for tech employees.\n\n\"That means performance gaps are identified and addressed faster, and if someone is not meeting clearly defined expectations over time, the path to a formal performance-management process (and potentially a role change or exit) can be shorter than it used to be,\" Friggeri wrote.\n\nMeta has been especially strict with its performance expectations. The tech giant laid off roughly 3,600 employees in February, labeling them low performers.\n\nThere are also benefits to being above the pack. Meta is introducing higher bonuses for top performers, Business Insider reported on Monday.\n\nIn his email, Friggeri clarified that the trend was not specific to Meta. Rather, it was industry-wide and reflected the state of the market. Meta did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nFriggeri shared four tips with Business Insider to stay ahead and avoid underperformance.\n\n1.) Workers should make expectations explicit.\n\n\"Align with your manager on priorities and what 'great' looks like for the next 30/60/90 days,\" Friggeri wrote.\n\n2.) Employees should seek out feedback.\n\nThey shouldn't wait for review cycles, Friggeri wrote. Feedback should be sought out \"early and often.\"\n\n3.) Focus on \"visible, high-leverage work.\"\n\n\"Pick projects tied to clear outcomes and communicate progress, risks, and tradeoffs,\" he wrote.\n\n4.) Keep investing in your skills\n\nFriggeri wrote that employees should \"treat learning as part of the job, especially as teams and priorities shift.\"\n\nOn the podcast, Friggeri advocated for being independent and building new projects — and not being silent about them. It's not helpful to \"lock yourself in a room,\" build for three months, and show up with the finished product.\n\n\"Overcommunicate is really the strategy I would recommend,\" he said.",

    "description": "China's JY-27A radar, touted for its ability to supposedly detect stealth aircraft, doesn't appear to have been effective during the US attack.",
    "fullText": "Venezuela's military had Chinese-made anti-aircraft radars available when the US launched a surprise air assault against the country to capture the country's now-former leader, Nicolás Maduro, earlier this month. They appear to have been of little help.\n\nOperation Absolute Resolve involved over 150 US military aircraft, none of which were shot down. A helicopter was hit, reportedly by machine gun fire, but remained operational.\n\nVenezuela has a number of China's JY-27A mobile radars, which Beijing has touted as top-of-the-line systems. It has said the radar can detect stealth assets, like the American F-22 and F-35, from over 150 miles away.\n\nThe success of the surprise raid by US special operators into downtown Caracas, part of a larger mission which involved not only stealth airpower but also older fourth-generation aircraft and helicopters, suggests that something didn't go as planned on defense. That may be on the operators rather than the tech though.\n\nAfter the raid, a Japanese reporter asked a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson what Beijing thought about the \"large amount of military equipment\" China sold Venezuela apparently being \"of little practical use.\" The Chinese spokesperson responded by condemning the US strike.\n\nThe Chinese-made JY-27A is a long-range radar used for detecting and tracking hostile aircraft in protected airpsace. Introduced in 2014, the radar system consists of a radar mast with multiple antenna panels supported by separate radar and control vehicles. Chinese sources claim it has features designed to reduce jamming. A newer version, the JY-27V, has since been developed.\n\nWhen Venezuela purchased JY-27As from China last year, there were claims that the radars were able to lock onto multiple F-35B fighter jets off the Venezuelan coast, presenting a potential challenge to the one-way transparency advantage of the US military.\n\n\"That's all well and good,\" Michael Sobolik, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, told Business Insider, \"but when it really matters is in a moment of conflict.\" Perhaps they were unable to withstand sophisticated electromagnetic spectrum attacks, or maybe they were improperly utilized by their operators. Either way, if they weren't effective, they were of little use for air defense.\n\nRadar systems are what inform air defense crews on what they'll need to target and what weapons they need to use. \"If you don't have functioning radars then you're a sitting duck,\" he said.\n\nUS military leaders said that American aircraft were able to overwhelm Venezuelan air defenses, which has been assessed to include a range of Russian-made systems like S-300VM batteries, Buk-M2 systems, and older S-125 Pechora-2M launchers, as well as the Chinese radars. Some of these pieces are capable but aren't the newest variants used by their respective exporters.\n\nIn the aftermath, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth mocked the effectiveness of the Russian air defenses. Nothing was said about the Chinese radars in that speech.\n\nKey to air defense is how the network works together, and the effectiveness of the operator is vital. In Venezuela's case, it may have been lacking the necessary conditions for successful air defense operations.\n\nA study from the Miami Strategic Intelligence Institute think tank, which hosts experts on Latin America, assessed Venezuela's air defenses as being in critical condition as of last year.\n\nIt said that over 60% of its radar fleet was non-operational, combat aviation doesn't fly often, and the country has received little maintenance support and spare parts from its exporters.\n\nVenezuela purchased Chinese-made radars and Russian-made surface-to-air missile batteries to modernize its air defenses, but the hardware alone can't make up for internal shortcomings.\n\nAnalysis by The New York Times found that some of Venezuela's air defense equipment was in storage or not operational, leaving it unprepared for the US attack. Reports also indicated Venezuela's military lacked the spare parts and technical background to keep air defense systems running.\n\nEven if the failures are on the part of the Venezuelan military, the ineffective performance of the Russian and Chinese systems sends a \"pretty big message,\" Sobolik said. It elevates confidence in US capabilities while raising questions about those of rivals.\n\nUS officials said no American aircraft or military personnel were lost during the raid on Venezuela. Of the 150 aircraft and almost 200 American troops involved in the mission, one helicopter took fire and seven troops were injured.",

    "description": "Rick Havacko decided to move to a new state after working remotely during the pandemic in California. He narrowed his choices to Austin or Nashville.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Rick Havacko, a 58-year-old corporate communications lead in Austin. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWorking remotely during the pandemic was the springboard for my move from California to Texas. I was born and raised in Orange County. I realized that although I love Laguna Niguel, I didn't want to live the rest of my life there.\n\nIt's beautiful, but once you get outside the city, it's congested, and prices are high.\n\nI've worked for Toshiba Business for 13 years, and I've always been fully remote. After my employer approved my move, the choice was between Austin (where I had visited before and enjoyed) and Nashville, which I had heard great things about.\n\nAfter traveling to both places in the summer of 2021, I decided to make Austin my home.\n\nBoth areas featured all the benefits of city life with a rural feel. Nashville is an amazing city and very similar to Austin. It has great music, culture, and a very creative vibe with tons of energy.\n\nWhat drew me to Austin is that it has my gym, LA Fitness, so I felt like I could really hit the ground running.\n\nI've been here for about four and a half years, and it's been one of the best things I've ever done.\n\nGrowing up in Orange County, the furthest I ever went was to San Diego for college, which is so close I could come home anytime I wanted. Austin was my first permanent move, so I had a little trepidation.\n\nI remember driving all night past Camp Pendleton, finally arriving in Tucson, Arizona, to spend the night. I got there about 1 a.m., and I felt a lot of uncertainty, like, Am I really going to like this place?\n\nWhen I hit the Hill Country, just before Fredericksburg, and headed into Austin, I passed the beautiful sawgrass and oak trees, and a sense of calm enveloped me, giving me the feeling that I was in a good place.\n\nI moved to Dripping Springs, which is 20 miles west of downtown Austin. It's more affordable than Southern California and less congested, but ultimately, it came down to the energy of the city and its people.\n\nI look outside my window, and often see deer, foxes, wild turkey, and even a Longhorn steer walking by my fence. I would never experience that in Laguna Niguel. I love nature.\n\nI no longer have immediate family in California, but I miss my friends back home. Making new friends has been the biggest challenge I've faced, but I keep trying. I've joined a volleyball league and play soccer and softball, where I meet people.\n\nI miss the world-class beaches in California; here we're pretty landlocked. I'm also a huge Angels fan. I grew up following the team, and Toshiba has a suite at Angel Stadium, so I used to attend many games. I also enjoyed attending LA Galaxy games. For now, I've adopted the University of Texas Longhorns for football and baseball, and I go to those games.\n\nWhile Texans are not required to file a state income tax return (only a federal one), property taxes appear to be significantly higher here. Properties themselves, however, are relatively inexpensive here. My property here is about twice the size of my home in California, and it was less expensive.\n\nOverall, it's still cheaper to live here, although Austin is one of the priciest cities in Texas. Gas is more affordable in Austin, but other living costs are comparable. I kept my same salary when I moved.\n\nHere in Dripping Springs, you see people with big belt buckles and cowboy boots. It's cool and culturally different from Orange County.\n\nDowntown Austin is one of the most vibrant and exciting places on the planet. It bustles with positive energy, with live music at pretty much every turn, and the University of Texas at Austin adds to that vibe.\n\nI'm very happy here and plan to stay permanently.",

    "title": "Goldman Sachs breaks down what the doomsayers get wrong about the US economy in 8 charts",
    "description": "Investors gripped with concern over the US economy can relax. Goldman Sachs explains why common worries, including frothy valuations, are overblown.",
    "fullText": "American investors are worried.\n\nThey've been worried for a while now: that a recession is coming, that stock valuations are overheated, and that AI spending is the only thing keeping the economy (and markets) afloat.\n\nAnd if you're in the wealth management business, like Goldman Sachs, it's your job to listen to these concerns. To nod solemnly and empathize as your millionaire clients lay bare their greatest fears. And then it's your job to tell them that, actually, things aren't so bad, and despite all the apparent chaos out there, it would be quite unwise to cash out your chips in the US stock market.\n\nGoldman Sachs' wealth management unit did just that Monday, sending out a report to clients saying that the outlook for the US economy and stock market is bright — and that most of the concerns keeping investors awake at night are overblown.\n\n\"Clients — and also some colleagues — are now asking whether it is time to reduce exposure to US equities in favor of other developed and emerging markets,\" the firm's Investment Strategy Group wrote in its 2026 outlook report. But it concludes that many of the perceived risks dominating conversations these days — from tariffs to government dysfunction to market concentration — are overstated, and that the most significant risk for equities, a US recession, is unlikely.\n\nThe group puts the probability of a recession at 25%, down from last year's estimate of around 35%. Instead, Goldman's base-case projection calls for continued economic expansion and robust earnings growth for the S&P 500.\n\n\"We wanted to emphasize that in spite of all the headlines that you read about 'Is America on the decline?' et cetera, we want to make a very strong stand and say, 'No, that is not the case,'\" Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, Chief Investment Officer of the Investment Strategy Group, said in a media appearance for the report's release.\n\nThe US remains the preeminent destination for investors around the world, Mossavar-Rahmani said — and a \"surprising\" number of popular narratives miss what's actually driving growth and returns.\n\n\"We want to dispel a couple of myths,\" Mossavar-Rahmani said.\n\nHere are some of the other takeaways from Goldman's Investment Strategy Group, and what they're telling wealthy clients to do with their money in 2026.\n\nGoldman's team argues that \"US preeminence\" is evident across multiple measures, including economic wealth, labor productivity, deep capital markets, and natural resources — advantages they say are difficult for other major economies to match.\n\nThey also point to US leadership in key innovation areas, including semiconductors, biotechnology, and AI, as well as the scale and liquidity of US equity and bond markets.\n\nDespite political turmoil and tariff uncertainty, Goldman says the US remains a magnet for global capital.\n\n\"When people say, 'Oh, money's flowing out of the US.' It actually isn't. We had one month when that was the case,\" Mossavar-Rahmani said.\n\nThat month of outflows came last April, in the aftermath of Trump's Liberation Day tariff plan announcement. Since then, foreign investors have flooded back into the US.\n\nOne argument for US economic fragility is that the boom in AI-adjacent tech spending — including data centers, chips, and power infrastructure — is propping up GDP.\n\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, which has a more dour global economic outlook, estimated the US would have been in a recession in the first half of last year if not for AI investments. A report from Deutsche Bank shows they're not alone in that sentiment.\n\nBut Goldman says that view is off base, and that people underestimate how much consumption contributes to GDP. The bank's investment strategy group estimates all tech-related spending accounted for 0.5% of the 2.1% GDP growth in 2025, and Goldman's chief economist says AI capital expenditures accounted for just 0.1%.\n\nThe estimate, which \"includes everything related to AI, including data centers,\" Mossavar-Rahmani said, is \"probably a little bit on the high side because they're trying to include all the power generation as well, all the utility infrastructure that has benefits elsewhere other than just AI.\"\n\nThis dovetails with the myth that the US stock market is dependent on AI and the Magnificent Seven stocks (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla), according to Mossavar-Rahmani.\n\n\"It's just not correct that AI has driven everything in the US, including all earnings and including S&P 500 returns,\" Mossavar-Rahmani said.\n\nWhile no one disputes the incredible performance of these tech titans, Goldman contends that the rest of the S&P 500 receives short shrift and that earnings growth and returns remain respectable even after stripping out the contributions from the Magnificent Seven.\n\n\"This idea that it would be a poor economy, a weak economy, no earnings, no returns is again, just another falsehood,\" Mossavar-Rahmani said.\n\nThe S&P 500 hit record highs last year, and investors often worry that new highs mean a painful drop is imminent. In reality, history shows that the market usually continues to post robust gains after hitting an all-time high, Goldman notes.\n\nWhile Goldman acknowledges valuations are elevated, it doesn't see an overheated market reminiscent of past market bubbles. It expects the S&P 500 to continue its rise in 2026, with a base-case estimate of a 7% total return and 10% earnings growth.\n\nGoldman's \"good\" scenario assumes a 17% return; its \"bad\" scenario assumes a 15% decline in a recession. (The team assigns a higher probability to upside than downside.)\n\n\"We do think that there are some good fundamental reasons why valuations have increased over time that are not just because of speculative excesses,\" said Brett Nelson, head of tactical asset allocation within Goldman's investment strategy group.\n\nIn the run-up to the Dot Com bust at the turn of the century, for example, valuations and investor exuberance were divorced from earnings reality, which isn't the case today.\n\nYes, the S&P 500 is highly concentrated, Goldman says, but today's tech companies have enormous profit margins justifying their stock valuations, not just hype.\n\nGoldman isn't worried about a bubble in US equities. Where its investment strategists do see cause for concern is bitcoin.\n\n\"We do think bitcoin is a bubble,\" Mossavar-Rahmani said, noting that explosive price behavior in the cryptocurrency usually precedes a steep drawdown.\n\n\"We are even more convinced than we were in 2021 that bitcoin has no real value, that it is a speculative and trading asset and that only questionable practices support its current price,\" the 2026 outlook report says.\n\nAnother area of concern is gold, which is at unsustainable price levels unless central banks — especially the Chinese government and households — continue to buy it to prop it up, Mossavar-Rahmani said.\n\n\"We do not recommend clients use gold or bitcoin as a hedge in their portfolios,\" the report says.\n\nThere are also \"pockets of euphoria\" in generative AI, with some public and private companies carrying bubble-like valuations, according to Goldman's outlook, which calls out the circular financing, easy credit, and questionable economics, coupled with soaring expectations.\n\n\"Some AI company founders and CEOs of the major companies involved with AI have raised expectations to an unrealistic level about what AI will deliver in the near future in terms of both revenues for the AI companies and productivity gains for enterprises leveraging AI,\" the report says.",

    "description": "While major banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Citi, warned that a 10% credit card cap would reduce access to credit, some CEOs applaud the plan.",
    "fullText": "Business leaders have mixed reviews of President Donald Trump's new plan for credit cards.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump said on Friday he would call for a one-year cap of 10% on credit card interest rates, arguing that consumers are being \"ripped off\" by rates that he said can be as high as 20% or 30%. Congress, not the president, has the power to implement such a cap. Similar proposals have previously stalled on Capitol Hill.\n\nMajor banks, including JPMorgan Chase, UBS, and Citi, warned that a 10% cap could reduce access to credit; others in the financial sector applauded the plan.\n\nHere is how business leaders have responded so far\n\nKlarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski backs Trump's plan.\n\nSiemiatkowski told CNBC in an interview on Monday that traditional credit cards are built to encourage consumers to put most of their spending on credit, and then carry big balances at steep interest rates. That dynamic, he said, pushes people to borrow more than they should and results in higher losses, especially among lower-income borrowers.\n\n\"I think Trump is wise here and is proposing something that makes a lot of sense,\" Siemiatkowski told CNBC on Monday.\n\n\"Capitalism is great, but anarchy is not,\" Siemiatkowski added regarding consumer protection.\n\nIn another interview with CNN, Siemiatkowski also said that credit card rewards like cash back and airline miles largely benefit wealthier consumers while lower-income cardholders shoulder more of the costs.\n\nJPMorgan's CFO said that Trump's plan could upend the company's business model.\n\n\"It's a very competitive business, but we wouldn't be in it if it weren't a good business for us,\" said Jeremy Barnum during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call. \"And in a world where price controls make it no longer a good business, that would present a significant challenge.\"\n\nJPMorgan said on its fourth-quarter earnings call that debit and credit card sales volume rose roughly 7% year over year and described the business as central to its retail-focused offerings.\n\nThe CEO of JPMorgan also weighed in on Trump's credit card proposal.\n\nJamie Dimon told investors on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call that reducing card interest rates could adversely affect customers with lower credit scores by limiting access to credit.\n\n\"If it happened the way it was described, it would be dramatic,\" Dimon said.\n\n\"This is a mistake, President,\" Bill Ackman, the billionaire CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, wrote on Friday on X in a now-deleted post.\n\n\"Without being able to charge rates adequate enough to cover losses and to earn an adequate return on equity, credit card lenders will cancel cards for millions of consumers who will have to turn to loan sharks for credit at rates higher than and on terms inferior to what they previously paid,\" Ackman added.\n\nAckman said in another post on Saturday that although Trump's goal is one that's \"worthy and important,\" the rate cap is not the way to achieve it.\n\n\"The best way to bring down rates would be to make it more competitive by making the regulatory regime more conducive to new entrants and new technologies,\" Ackman wrote.\n\nThe SoFi CEO believes that his business and consumers could stand to benefit from Trump's credit card rate cap.\n\n\"If this is enacted — and that's a big if, though part of me hopes it is — we would likely see a significant contraction in industry credit card lending,\" Anthony Noto wrote in a post on X. \"Credit card issuers simply won't be able to sustain profitability at a 10% rate cap.\"\n\n\"Consumers, however, will still need access to credit. That creates a large void — one that @SoFi personal loans are well positioned to fill,\" Noto added.\n\nNoto also said that personal loans could be an alternative to addressing debt, though that would make underwriting discipline and borrower education \"even more important.\"",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk has a Valentine's Day present for Tesla owners: another subscription.\n\nThe billionaire said on Wednesday that Tesla will stop making its Full Self-Driving feature available as a one-off purchase and will only offer the assisted driving software as a subscription service.\n\n\"Tesla will stop selling FSD after Feb 14. FSD will only be available as a monthly subscription thereafter,\" the Tesla CEO wrote in a post on X.\n\nTesla owners currently have the option to buy FSD for $8,000 or pay $99 a month to access the service.\n\nIt comes as the company struggles to get customers to pay for the technology, which Musk has regularly described as critical to Tesla's future.\n\nIn Tesla's third-quarter earnings call in October, the company's CFO told investors that only around 12% of Tesla's current fleet subscribed to FSD, with quarterly revenue decreasing compared to the same period the previous year.\n\nBoosting FSD subscriptions is also a key part of Musk's mammoth pay package, which was approved by Tesla investors in November. Reaching 10 million FSD subscriptions is among the milestones that Tesla needs to hit for Musk to unlock the full $1 trillion payout.\n\nThe company's rollout of Full Self-Driving, which allows a Tesla vehicle to drive itself in most situations but requires human supervision at all times, has attracted regulatory scrutiny and lawsuits.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced investigations last year into whether Tesla correctly reported crashes linked to FSD, and over reports of Tesla vehicles with FSD activated running red lights and driving on the wrong side of the road.\n\nTesla also faces a potential ban on selling vehicles in California after a judge ruled that the company's marketing of its Full Self Driving and Autopilot systems misled consumers.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "description": "\"The people who are most successful create content that fills a gap they've identified on their own,\" said content creator Michela Allocca.",
    "fullText": "Michela Allocca, 30, started posting about personal finance on Instagram in 2019 as a \"creative outlet to find satisfaction outside my job,\" she told Business Insider.\n\nShe kept things simple and inexpensive, using an iPhone and a ring light to record videos.\n\nHer account, Break Your Budget, took off after she expanded to TikTok during the COVID-19 pandemic. By 2021, Allocca had more than 200,000 followers and was earning more from content creation than from her day job at an investment consulting firm.\n\nShe went all in on Break Your Budget in April 2022. Since then, she's quadrupled her former corporate income and built a seven-figure net worth, thanks to diligent saving and prudent investing.\n\nHer income is split roughly evenly between two main revenue streams: About 50% comes from brand partnerships. The other half comes from digital products, including her expense tracker and financial independence calculator, which provide recurring monthly income. More recently, she's added affiliate income and YouTube AdSense, which made up about 10% of her income last year.\n\nHere's how Allocca says creators can make money online in 2026.\n\nAllocca focused on creating the kind of content that she personally would want as a woman navigating money in her 20s: easy-to-understand, actionable advice.\n\n\"It was so, so simple and straightforward,\" she said. \"And I do think that really resonated with people.\"\n\nHer advice to aspiring creators: make content that fills a gap you've personally experienced.\n\n\"The people who are most successful create content that fills a gap they've identified on their own,\" she said. \"They're forging their own style and niche instead of seeing what works for someone else and trying to recreate it.\"\n\nAllocca says she approaches content as if she's making it for herself. \"If I wanted to learn more about this topic, how would I want to consume it?\" she said. \"That's what I'm making — because if I want to consume it in this way, there's going to be, hopefully, thousands of other girls who want to consume the same thing.\"\n\nDigital products now account for a significant portion of Allocca's income. She said she's brought in over $1 million selling budgeting templates and other tools.\n\nShe attributes that success to authenticity: \"I don't sell products that I don't use.\"\n\nThat approach helps with trust and accountability.\n\n\"If I'm going to tell my audience to do something or look at something a different way or track their expenses, I'm also sharing myself doing it,\" she said. \"I'm not selling something I don't actually do.\"\n\nAnother key to Allocca's success is paying attention to trends and adapting accordingly.\n\n\"There's this idea that the life cycle of a creator is two or three years before you taper off,\" said Allocca, who's noticed a pattern of creators growing quickly, then losing momentum as they shift focus to side projects and stop prioritizing content. \"I've made a really concerted effort to keep my content front and center and the main focus of my business, so that I don't taper off, and part of that is changing how I say things and adapting to what's trending, and what people care about.\"\n\nFor example, during the pandemic, she focused on recession fears. When the job market boomed, she pivoted to career content. As inflation rose and layoffs followed, she leaned into budgeting and cutting expenses.\n\n\"Over the last year or so, we've seen a huge shift to anti-consumerism and spending less, so I've focused my content a lot around shopping, buying better, and how to spend less and live on less,\" she said. \"Keeping a pulse on those trends has helped a lot with diversifying my brand, but also remaining relevant.\"",

    "description": "Grindr aims to establish four successful direct-to-consumer businesses each making $15-30 million in 2028, an internal document shows.",
    "fullText": "In 2025, Grindr launched a medication side hustle. The company's internal product strategy roadmap shows its ambition to launch other DTC offerings and scale them into meaningful moneymakers.\n\nGrindr plans to create multiple new direct-to-consumer businesses, according to a product strategy plan obtained by Business Insider. Its goal is to scale up four successful DTC businesses each earning between $15 and $30 million in revenue in 2028.\n\n\"Our users have significant disposable income and are spending it on DTC products and services elsewhere — e.g., medications; wellness and fitness products; luxury experiences; travel; networking,\" the document reads.\n\n\"We are creating new business lines to capture some of this spending, knowing some of it will fail,\" it continues.\n\nThe strategy document also includes an expansion of its AI bet, going beyond existing products like A-List and Discover, which are referred to as \"just the first examples.\"\n\n\"We're going to deploy this through the entire app,\" the document says.\n\nA representative for Grindr declined to comment.\n\nGrindr launched Woodwork, its erectile dysfunction medication business, in 2025. At the time, CEO George Arison previewed possible expansion opportunities.\n\n\"I don't think ED meds will be the only thing,\" he told Fast Company in May. \"It'd be logical to extend into haircare, skincare, and other things of that nature.\"\n\nIn its second quarter earnings presentation, Grindr teased its \"gayborhood expansion\" plans, describing a \"digital neighborhood where they can find products and services they need.\"\n\nIt's an unusual strategy in the dating app market. Tinder isn't selling hair-care products, and Bumble isn't selling bath bombs. Most of these businesses focus on juicing their paying subscriber base, rather than opening entirely new lines of revenue.\n\nIf a dating app does dip its toes into a side hustle, it's typically merch. In 2020, Hinge opened a limited-time merchandise shop featuring baseball caps and a s'mores kit. Sniffies, likely Grindr's most direct competitor, has a popular apparel line.\n\nHow will Grindr build these businesses? It's likely they'll start small.\n\nArison told Business Insider in September that he kept Woodwork compact and low-profile to give it the best chance of success.\n\n\"It's a very small nimble team,\" Arison said. \"We could easily give them two more people and wouldn't really make a difference to the Grindr parent company, but you don't want to overstaff something like that.\"\n\nDo you work for a dating app?

    "fullText": "The hottest fashion item for women in finance right now isn't a flashy accessory like a scarf or a watch, or an expensive pair of shoes. It's a good old pair of pants.\n\nThis week, I did some boots-on-the-ground reporting in Midtown Manhattan, visiting stores to ask about their best-selling women's business attire items. Time and again, pants kept coming up.\n\nBut we're not talking about any ordinary pants — in most cases, they're made with comfortable, high-quality fabric and fall on the pricier side, ranging from around $60 to $350 a pair.\n\nOften, they're also a bit baggy.\n\n\"I think wide-cut, high-waist is the trend,\" said Cassie Henry, a trader at Gresham Investment Management.\n\nHere are five of the big hitters in the Wall Street women's pants battle:\n\nPants name: The Effortless Pant\n\nAritzia has crushed earnings lately, pushing its share price up 119% over the last year.\n\nOne of the drivers of that growth? Its $148, TikTok-famous Effortless Pant.\n\nPants name: Daydrift High-Rise Trouser\n\nLululemon probably started the expensive pants craze, albeit with their athleisure wear. It was therefore no surprise that the brand launched its Daydrift pants in 2025.\n\n\"At some points it's completely sold out,\" a sales associate said. \"I\"d say it's most women's go-to whenever they come in looking for anything.\"\n\nPants name: Sloane Tailored Pant\n\nFor millennials, it's hard not to associate Abercrombie with jeans. However, the brand has made a strategic shift towards fancier attire.\n\n\"That's where everybody gets their pants from,\" said Nyla Legemah, a customer success manager for benchmarks and indices at London Stock Exchange Group in New York.\n\nPants name: Veilance Khara Pant\n\nArc'teryx is predominantly an outerwear brand — think an even more intense version of Patagonia. But the brand has gotten in on the pants gold rush, too.\n\n\"We have a lot more die-hards for the menswear stuff,\" a sales associate said. \"But they are obviously branching out into the women's line, so I think it's gaining momentum and we're seeing a lot more women coming in.\"\n\nPants name: High-Rise Fluid Crepe Trouser\n\nClub Monaco goes for the old-money vibe, and they're priced like it, too. A sales associate said their high-rise fluid crepe trouser was probably their most popular item.\n\n\"I know my friends like Club Monaco,\" Henry, the trader, said.",

    "title": "From humanoid robots to agentic AI, I learned what retail insiders are buzzing about at a major industry conference",
    "description": "AI and innovation — from humanoid robots to agents — dominated the conversation at the National Retail Federation's Big Show 2026.",
    "fullText": "There were two little letters on everyone's lips: AI.\n\nEach year, the National Retail Federation, a leading industry trade group, hosts one of the industry's largest conferences, known as Retail's Big Show. I attended the convention, held in New York City from January 11 to 13, for the first time to hear from industry insiders about the retail trends to watch in 2026.\n\nThis year's event drew speakers such as Walmart's incoming CEO John Furner and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, who announced a new AI deal this week, as well as Fanatics CEO Michael Rubin. It was clear that artificial intelligence was the big topic on the minds of the attendees from over 5,000 brands at the event.\n\nWalking the expo hall, \"AI\" and \"agentic\" seemed to be mentioned on nearly every other banner or booth I passed. Onstage, retail leaders touted their AI strategies.\n\nLarge retailers, such as Walmart and Lowe's, have introduced their own AI shopping agents or partnered with AI platforms like Google's Gemini and OpenAI's ChatGPT; however, these efforts are still in their early stages.\n\nI also saw firsthand how some companies are experimenting with new technologies. There were humanoid robots walking up to greet attendees and digital drive-thru menu boards with bright colors advertising to retailers what their AI-powered menus could look like.\n\nDespite some of the noise surrounding retail's AI-powered direction, CEOs, including Fran Horowitz of Abercrombie & Fitch, said young founders should keep the fundamentals top of mind while embracing innovation. Improving customer service, for instance, remains at the forefront of retailer decision-making.\n\nIn one session, Ralph Lauren's chief branding and innovation officer, David Lauren, talked about his brand's longtime partnership with Microsoft. It led to the creation of Ask Ralph, a chatbot-style customer assistant. The bot is powered by Microsoft's AI, but it is designed to function like a styling assistant that suggests clothing based on prompts, such as an occasion you're attending.\n\nIt's a taste of the future with the personal touch customers may want from a store associate.\n\n\"It's like having Ralph Lauren in your pocket,\" Lauren said at the conference.\n\nCurrently, AI is most useful for bargain-hunting and basic customer service, according to a panel about Gen Z that included members of The Z Suite, a collective of consultants specializing in the consumer space. Chatbots like Ask Ralph can be convenient in a pinch, but the shopping experience doesn't begin and end there, the Gen Z consultants who ranged in age from 17 to 24 said.\n\nYoung people seem to still crave some of the old-school fundamentals that define retail: quality, customer service, and in-store experiences. There's no replicating trying on the perfect dress in person, one young panelist said.\n\nThey said they see AI as a starting point that they can use to find the unique items they covet. They're willing to put in the work to find the right item for them. This includes scouring Reddit for \"real\" reviews that TikTok influencers may not offer, said Olivia Meyer, a buyer who is part of The Z Suite.\n\nAnd although they're not rushing to get on the phone with a customer service representative, the consultants said they want to talk to a human when their money is at stake.\n\nThese Gen Z retail professionals, who also included a global merchant for Calvin Klein and a marketing associate, said they want their clothes to come from authentic brands that are transparent about their use of AI. They pointed to online speculation about AI models in ads, saying Gen Z doesn't care if the brands use AI models; they just want the truth.\n\nThey want to get their money's worth for the clothes that they're buying, which is why data shows this demographic is straying away from fast fashion and toward shopping secondhand on sites like Vinted and eBay.\n\nTrue Religion's chief marketing officer, Kristen D'Arcy, who moderated the panel, said shoppers are craving authenticity in the world of AI-generated content, and it's making them more discerning. To that end, the denim brand has leveraged partnerships that align with its values, such as collaborations with artists like Megan Thee Stallion.\n\nThe three-day event gave me a glimpse into the retail landscape of 2026.\n\nAI may be the loudest trend, but that doesn't mean brands should forget the basics.",

    "title": "Trump's sweeping proposals for credit cards and student debt could be a big deal for other lenders",
    "description": "With Trump's proposed cap on credit card interest rates and new caps on student loans, more Americans might turn to alternative lenders.",
    "fullText": "More Americans might find themselves turning to personal and private loans this year.\n\nProposed changes to the lending market could impact banks and consumers starting this year, particularly in two of the largest areas of consumer debt: credit cards and student loans. Private and personal lending firms could end up big winners if those changes stick.\n\nOn the student debt side, President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation called for new borrowing caps on graduate and professional loans in an attempt to curb excessive borrowing. It also eliminated the Grad and Parent PLUS programs, which allowed parents and graduate students to borrow up to the full cost of attendance for their programs.\n\nMore recently, Trump proposed a one-year, 10% cap on credit card interest rates, which he said would prevent credit card companies from \"ripping off\" consumers.\n\nThe changes to student loan borrowing are set to take effect in July, while it's unclear if Trump's credit card proposal will come to fruition, as its most likely path would be through congressional legislation.\n\nSome policy experts and lenders have said that the caps on rates could mean banks reduce credit card offerings, and caps on student loan borrowing could drive consumers to private loans to help fill the gap.\n\nAs the cost of living continues to rise in the US, personal loans, credit card debt, and student debt are already at record highs. While the benefit of a personal loan is that its flexible terms allow it to be used for a wide range of purposes, interest rates vary depending on credit scores, similar to credit cards.\n\nSimilarly, taking on private student loans could also be riskier than federal financing because their interest rates are often variable, meaning the rate could increase or decrease over the loan's lifetime.\n\nA joint statement from several banking associations said that the cap on credit card interest \"would only drive consumers toward less regulated, more costly alternatives\" such as personal and payday loans.\n\nOn Tuesday, JPMorgan Chase's CFO said that if the interest cap were to take effect, it may not be worth it for the bank to be in the credit card business. Similarly, student borrowers without sufficient financing for their programs may turn to private lending.\n\nPersonal lending company SoFi is an example of a company that could benefit from both policies. CEO Anthony Noto wrote in a post on X that, should Trump's credit card cap proposal be implemented, consumers would need access to more credit.\n\n\"That creates a large void—one that @SoFi personal loans are well positioned to fill,\" Noto said.\n\nNoto also said during an August earnings call that the elimination of Grad and Parent PLUS loans could lead to \"further opportunities for in school lending and student loan refinance.\" Private lender Navient's CEO, David Yowan, expressed a similar idea during an earnings call: \"Grad PLUS elimination is a substantial and significant expansion of opportunities that we have with graduate students.\"\n\nA SoFi spokesperson told Business Insider that the company prioritizes affordability, \"and providing members with a more accessible and safer path to financial independence.\"\n\nAn analysis by credit reporting firm TransUnion found that unsecured personal loan balances reached record highs in the third quarter of 2025, totaling $269 billion.\n\nThe accumulation of debt is a concern shared by some policy experts and lawmakers, particularly regarding student loans. In August, Sen. Elizabeth Warren led some of her colleagues in sending letters to the major private student-loan lenders asking for information on how they plan to protect borrowers in anticipation of an influx into the private lending market.\n\n\"Student debt places a tremendous burden on borrowers, their families, their communities, and the U.S. economy, driving employment, spending, and housing decisions that have long-lasting negative impacts on borrowers' financial health,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"Placing a greater share of student loans into the hands of private lenders threatens to make these problems much worse.\"",

    "title": "The 3 main storylines investors need to be watching as earnings season picks up steam",
    "description": "The continued adoption of AI, and how much companies are spending to do so, will be top of mind.",
    "fullText": "Earnings season kicked off with a bang on Tuesday with a report from headliner JPMorgan.\n\nThe company's stock ultimately fell 4% due to a mix of two factors unique to the business: (1) a surprise drop in investment banking revenue and (2) uncertainty around President Trump's proposed credit card interest cap, to which JPMorgan is especially exposed as America's largest issuer.\n\nIt was a good primer for the upcoming earnings season, which could make or break the fortunes of major US companies, especially when it comes to AI plans.\n\nThe previous quarter already saw a simmering of the red-hot AI trade for companies planning to continue spending heavily on capex without immediate tangible results. Just ask Meta and Microsoft how it went when they pledged to keep pouring billions into AI (spoiler alert: not well).\n\nWith that in mind, First Trade — with the help of the equity strategy team at Goldman Sachs — has put together a three-part earnings primer for those looking to gain an edge up.\n\n1. Watch for signs of AI-adoption progress\n\nSo far, in the AI trade, it's been the infrastructure stocks that have dominated — the chipmakers and picks-and-shovels companies that make up the physical components of data centers.\n\nGoldman says that gains will broaden out to increasingly include companies showing productivity gains unlocked by AI.\n\nA prime example of this dynamic in action came last quarter, from freight-logistics company CH Robinson, which raised its profit-growth forecast specifically due to new AI efficiencies. The stock spiked 20% during the next trading day, and it's been at record highs pretty much ever since.\n\nThe market is being clear about what it wants. Actually achieving that is the hard part.\n\n2. Monitor how companies are planning to spend their cash\n\nConcerns over AI overspending reached a fever pitch last quarter — a trend Goldman expects to subside throughout 2026 after one last hurrah. The firm predicts that hyperscaler capex will see above-forecast growth for one more quarter, then begin a gradual deceleration, as shown in this chart:\n\nAn additional element to watch is the degree to which that AI capex spending comes at the expense of share repurchases. After all, buybacks are crucial for engineering share-price increases during periods devoid of other positive catalysts.\n\nGoldman predicts that investors will reward companies generating strong free cash flow, which have the flexibility to return cash to shareholders. The firm says that group of stocks already outperformed throughout 2025.\n\n3. Check the sustainability of earnings growth for mega-cap tech\n\nThe number to watch here is 20%. That's the target Goldman has set for Magnificent 7 profit expansion in the quarter. Any downside disappointment here could mean stock declines. After all, earnings growth is the lifeblood of any bull market.",

    "description": "Companies are laying off or restructuring to have fewer middle managers with more reports each. This can be done well — or it can lead to burnout.",
    "fullText": "The great middle manager flattening is in full swing, and those who remain are seeing their dominions balloon.\n\nIt's the era of the megamanager, driven by cost cutting, leaner bureaucracy, and slow hiring. A new Gallup survey reveals how teams are evolving and the factors that contribute to manager burnout.\n\nManagers' average number of reports — their \"span of control\" — has grown over the past year, rising from 10.9 in 2024 to 12.1 in 2025. It's also a marked increase from pre-pandemic levels; in 2013, managers had an average of 8.2 people reporting to them, and by 2019, this number had increased to around 9.\n\nThat's driven primarily by an increase in teams with 25 or more people, which saw a two percentage point rise over the past year. Around 13% of managers have 25 or more direct reports. At the same time, 97% of managers are taking on individual contributor work that falls outside of their leadership purview.\n\n\"I don't think increasing span of control blindly is going to work very effectively if those conditions aren't taken into account,\" Jim Harter, Gallup's chief scientist of workplace management and well-being, said of the balance between individual contributor tasks and leadership responsibilities.\n\nIn recent years, layoffs at firms like Intel, Amazon, and Meta have trimmed middle managers to rectify what they viewed as excessive layers of bureaucracy.\n\n\"Having fewer managers will remove layers and flatten organizations more than they are today,\" Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a 2024 memo. \"If we do this work well, it will increase our teammates' ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership.\"\n\nFlattening management layers is a concept that experts previously told Business Insider is sound, provided that remaining managers have support, training, and the right mix of responsibilities.\n\nIn 2024, Yvonne Lee-Hawkins, a middle manager, told Business Insider that she had gone from managing zero to 21 direct reports and ultimately quit due to burnout.\n\n\"Our meetings became transactional because we only had time to discuss the most urgent issues,\" Lee-Hawkins said. \"We no longer had time to get to know each other, ask questions, seek advice, or work on career development.\"\n\nWhat's key in trimming layers, as the Gallup survey illustrates, is how engaged workers already feel, and how these new megamanagers spend their time. For instance, managers who spend less time on individual contributor work — tasks outside their leadership duties — typically have more engaged teams, regardless of the team's size.\n\n\"When you have employees increasingly detached from their employer, and then you suddenly start increasing span of control without putting the right conditions in place, I think you run a risk because they're already increasingly feeling detached,\" Harter said. \"We found that managers that have at least one weekly meaningful conversation with each employee do substantially better.\"\n\nTanuj Deora, a Gen X vice president for deployment at clean energy firm Sparkfund, said that the trend around being more \"thoughtful\" about bureaucratic structure within companies has value. He's held management roles since the late 1990s, advising on structures for teams of up to 50. He said it's essential to consider a manager's level of experience.\n\n\"If they're relatively new managers, you probably want to give them five or six people. You want to give them a couple of people,\" Deora said.\n\nGallup's Harter said that there are often two reasons someone becomes a manager: They're a strong individual contributor, or they have a long tenure at their company. However, neither of those factors necessarily relates to how effective they'll be in a managerial role.\n\n\"What happens is in organizations, people stay a while, and they feel a need to promote people continually. And the avenue for promotion tends to be, we're going to give you a managerial role because it tends to be associated with more money and status,\" Harter said. \"I would say the most effective organizations think about how they create high-status individual contributor roles so that people don't feel like they have to become a manager to be effective.\"",

    "description": "A growing number of domestic and international airlines are offering Starlink WiFi to passengers, like United Airlines, British Airways, and Emirates.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk's Starlink has gained yet another airline customer as the ultra-high-speed WiFi service continues to gain popularity.\n\nThe Lufthansa Group announced in January that it's installing Starlink and expects to start offering it in the second half of this year.\n\nThe company is named for the German flag carrier, but it also owns several more airlines across Europe, including national carriers for Austria, Belgium, Italy, and Switzerland.\n\nLufthansa has a fleet of around 850 aircraft across all its airlines, and its announcement means more than 30 airlines are now set to have Starlink.\n\nBusiness Insider previously tested Starlink on Qatar Airways' first flight with it last October. The connection speed peaked at 215 megabits per second, more than enough for a lag-free video call, and faster than many cable-based internet services.\n\nStarlink functions thanks to a constellation of over 7,000 satellites, which allows internet connections in remote locations, such as flying over an ocean. The satellites are in low-earth orbit, which means faster internet speeds — but also disrupts astronomers.\n\nStarlink isn't the only game in town, however.\n\nJetBlue has signed up for Amazon Leo, which functions similarly, but has only launched 150 satellites so far.\n\nAnother in-flight WiFi rival is Viasat, which is used by Delta Air Lines and American Airlines. It only has a handful of satellites in a geostationary orbit, which have a longer time delay.\n\nWhile it has rivals, Starlink wants to cement its dominance. As Starlink grows in popularity, it could be that more carriers All airlines with Starlink offer it free of charge, although some require passengers to \n\nAs of Lufthansa's announcement, here are all the airlines that have publicly announced plans to launch Starlink:\n\nThe Irish flag carrier is part of International Airlines Group, which announced its Starlink deal in early November. It's set to roll out Starlink from early 2026, but plans are still being finalized across the conglomerate.\n\nLatvia's airBaltic flies around Europe and the Middle East only using Airbus A220 jets. It was the first European airline to adopt Starlink, and hopes to complete installation on all its planes by the end of the year.\n\nAir Busan is a budget carrier and a subsidiary of Korean Air, which announced in December that it's adding Starlink.\n\nWhile the legacy carrier has clearer plans for its wide-body jets, Korean said Air Busan will review which planes to prioritize.\n\n\"Rollout schedules will vary by carrier, with the earliest service introduction expected as early as the third quarter of 2026,\" it added.\n\nAir Dolomiti is a regional airline that only operates Embraer jets and focuses on connecting Italian destinations with other cities around Europe.\n\nIt's a subsidiary of Lufthansa, which announced its deal with Starlink in January.\n\nIntroduction is set to begin in the second half of 2026, with all Lufthansa Group planes equipped with Starlink by 2029. The company said access would be free for all status customers and Travel ID users.\n\nThe French flag carrier announced its Starlink deal last September, available to Flying Blue loyalty members. Installation began across its fleet, including regional planes, this summer.\n\nAir New Zealand first said it was working with Starlink two years ago. It then rolled it out on two domestic aircraft in June, saying that it was \"currently in the test phase.\"\n\nAir Seoul is a budget carrier and another subsidiary of Korean Air. Like with Air Busan, it is not yet clear which jets will get Starlink.\n\nAfter merging with Hawaiian Airlines — the first major carrier to offer Starlink — Alaska Airlines announced its deal in August. It says it will first be available next year and will be rolled out across the fleet by 2027.\n\nAsiana Airlines is another subsidiary of Korean Air.\n\nThe two airlines merged in 2024, while the Asiana brand is set to be phased out by the end of next year.\n\n\"Following the integration with Asiana Airlines, the airline plans to complete fleetwide installation by the end of 2027,\" Korean said in its Starlink announcement.\n\nIt also said it will prioritize installation on its Boeing 777 and Airbus A350 jets.\n\nThe flag carrier of Austria is a subsidiary of Lufthansa, which announced its deal with Starlink in January.\n\nWhile Lufthansa said the rollout will start in the second half of 2026, it isn't clear exactly when Austrian jets will get Starlink.\n\nThe UK flag carrier is also part of IAG. BA said it would start rolling out Starlink next year and that it would be available free of charge to all its passengers.\n\nBelgium's national airline is another subsidiary of Lufthansa, which announced its deal with Starlink in January.\n\nLufthansa's rollout of Starlink will begin in late 2026.\n\nEdelweiss Air is a sister company to Swiss International Air Lines. Both are subsidiaries of Lufthansa.\n\nLike with other Lufthansa-owned airlines, Starlink will be free for all status customers and Travel ID users.\n\nDubai's airline is starting to roll out Starlink this month and plans to add it to all 232 in-service aircraft by mid-2027. It's also set to operate the first double-decker Airbus A380 with the service.\n\nEurowings is a German budget airline and another subsidiary of Lufthansa, which announced its deal with Starlink in January.\n\nStarlink will be free for all Lufthansa Group status customers and Travel ID users.\n\nThe Emirati budget airline also announced its Starlink deal during this month's Dubai Airshow. It only operates Boeing 737s and plans to install Starlink on 100 of them from next year.\n\nThe Spanish flag carrier is also part of IAG. The conglomerate said it would roll out Starlink across its fleets from 2026.\n\nItaly's flag carrier is part-owned by the country's government and the Lufthansa Group.

    "description": "Andreessen Horowitz cofounder Ben Horowitz said AI's surge isn't just hype, saying that record demand and adoption explain soaring valuations.",
    "fullText": "Silicon Valley leaders have debated for months whether the AI boom is a bubble. Ben Horowitz says that debate misses what's really happening.\n\nIn a wide-ranging discussion on \"The A16z Show\" on Tuesday, the cofounder of the VC firm Andreessen Horowitz said AI represents something larger than past tech waves — including the internet — and that the eye-popping valuations can't be understood without looking at what's actually happening underneath the surface.\n\n\"AI is a new computing platform,\" Horowitz said. In his view, that puts it in a different category from incremental software shifts.\n\n\"This is a bigger technology market than I've ever seen,\" he added.\n\nSkeptics, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, and hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio, often point to how fast valuations have risen to predict a looming bubble.\n\nBut Horowitz said that focusing on prices alone ignores a more important signal: demand.\n\n\"One of the reasons why people are so worried about it being a bubble is, you know, the valuations have gone up so fast,\" he said. \"But if you look at what's going on underneath in terms of the customer adoption, the revenue growth rates — we've never seen demand like this.\"\n\nThat disconnect, he said, explains why AI feels unsettling even to seasoned investors.\n\n\"We've never seen valuations rise like this, but we've never seen demand rise like this either,\" Horowitz said, describing the current moment as \"a bit of a brave new world.\"\n\nHorowitz also pushed back on the idea that AI will produce only a handful of dominant winners, as the internet did — a view promoted by former Shark Tank star Mark Cuban.\n\nHorowitz sees a much larger opportunity set.\n\n\"It's a very big design space — an enormous design space like one we've never seen before in technology,\" he said, predicting more billion- and even $10 billion-plus companies than in prior cycles.\n\nPart of that expansion comes from how AI is being built. Rather than a single, all-powerful model doing everything, Horowitz said real products require complex applications that deeply model human behavior — work that can't simply be absorbed by foundation models.\n\nThe result, he believes, is a technology shift that is both messier and more powerful than past revolutions — and one where fears of a simple bubble may underestimate just how much is changing.",

    "description": "Rachel Swanson, a registered dietitian, aims to eat protein and fiber as well as a wide variety of plants to support a healthy microbiome.",
    "fullText": "Most dietary advice is fairly straightforward: eat whole foods with a good balance of protein, fiber, carbs, and healthy fats.\n\nConsistently adhering to that guidance is another story, particularly if you live a busy life.\n\nRachel Swanson, a registered dietitian at LifeSpan Medicine and author of \"Trying!: A Science-Backed Plan to Optimize Your Fertility,\" splits her time between New York City and Miami, spending about half the year in each. She also takes small-group workout classes three times a week, focusing on strength training.\n\nShe says eating enough nutrients, especially protein for muscle-building, is crucial for her. She generally aims for around 0.7 grams of protein per pound of body weight, the protein intake usually recommended for physically active people.\n\n\"Every single ingredient is going to be very intentionally added,\" Swanson, 35, told Business Insider. \"What are the foods that are going to give me the biggest bang-for-my-nutritional-buck, so to speak?\" She incorporates foods like blueberries and sweet potatoes for their high fiber and vitamin content.\n\nThroughout the workweek, she follows an \"automated\" meal plan, eating mostly foods she batch-cooked in advance. Beyond making her jam-packed days easier, preparing meals in advance helps her eat a wide variety of plants — essential for good gut health.\n\n\"I know every single day is built in support for my gut microbiome,\" she said, deliberately rotating which vegetables, herbs, and spices she uses in her cooking to increase her variety.\n\nSwanson shared what she typically eats in a day to get enough protein, fiber, and other nutrients.\n\nSwanson is typically too busy to eat a full breakfast on weekday mornings. Because she starts her clinic hours at 8 a.m., she usually packs in media interviews and other meetings right before.\n\nShe keeps her mornings simple with some lemon water, coffee, or yerba mate — a caffeinated herbal drink similar to tea with additional antioxidants.\n\nIf she has time to eat, it's usually a quick high-protein snack to keep her satiated until her early lunch. Lately, it's been homemade turkey meatballs with sweet potatoes, onions, and blueberries.\n\nMost of Swanson's lunches are pre-cooked meals, and she usually has two different options in the fridge to avoid the monotony of eating the same lunch five days in a row.\n\nShe frequently opts for hearty soups and stews. The meals usually feature an animal protein, like chicken, and Swanson rotates the vegetables and herbs.\n\n\"I like to get whatever's in season if possible — that's just automatically going to maximize the diversity,\" she said.\n\nOne of her favorites is a protein- and fiber-packed \"golden soup\" with chicken, bone broth, carrots, cauliflower, white beans, light coconut milk, ginger, and some turmeric, which has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits.\n\nSwanson isn't a big snacker, but she loves a warm beverage.\n\nIn the winter, she makes hot chocolate with CocoaVia, a cocoa supplement infused with flavanols, which have been shown to have some heart and brain health benefits. She mixes the powder with non-dairy milk and a small amount of sweetener.\n\nAnother favorite treat is a homemade matcha latte. She prepares ceremonial-grade matcha with non-dairy milk and mixes in about a tablespoon of chia seeds, which add protein, fiber, and omega-3s and can also help with appetite control.\n\n\"The combination, I know it probably sounds crazy when I describe it, but it's literally like drinking boba tea because it's chewy and fun,\" she said. \"It's the easiest possible way to get 5 grams of fiber injected into your day.\"\n\nLike her lunches, Swanson also batch-preps most of her dinners, which always feature a core protein and at least one vegetable for fiber and nutrients.\n\nA recent favorite was a fajita made with grass-fed steak, which studies find to be leaner and richer in omega-3s than regular steak. She added sautéed peppers, onions, and pineapple, topping the meal with fresh cilantro to further maximize her microbiome diversity.\n\nFollowing her rule of ensuring every meal has some nutritional value, Swanson likes to make a smoothie with frozen mixed berries, frozen cauliflower, non-dairy milk, and a scoop of chocolate or nut butter-flavored protein powder (she opts for an organic, grass-fed beef isolate version).\n\nShe said it's a delicious way to get a little extra protein and fiber. \"It kind of turns out as a chocolate-covered-cherry or a PB&J flavor,\" she said.",

    "description": "Waymo plans to introduce two new vehicle  platforms to its robotaxi fleet: the Hyundai IONIQ 5 and China's Zeekr, which Waymo is branding, \"Ojai.\"",
    "fullText": "Alphabet-backed Waymo plans to add two new vehicles to its robotaxi fleet in the near future, including a roomier four-seater the company is calling the \"Ojai,\" named after a small southern California city.\n\nThe two cars will be integrated with Waymo's sixth-generation AI driver, which will have a reduced sensor suite.\n\nSandy Karp, a Waymo spokesperson, took Business Insider through a walkthrough of the new robotaxis during the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.\n\nThe Ojai, pictured on the left, is an EV made by Chinese Tesla rival Zeekr.\n\nKarp told Business Insider that Waymo aims to launch Ojai for public riders by 2026. The company has been testing the vehicle in several cities, including San Francisco.\n\nWaymo will also be adding the Hyundai IONIQ 5 SUV to its vehicle lineup.\n\nThe robotaxi company announced a \"multi-year, strategic partnership\" with the South Korean automaker in late 2024.\n\nA launch date for the IONIQ 5 Waymo has not been announced.\n\nWaymo took a deliberate step in removing any Zeekr branding on the Ojai, going as far as adding a Waymo-branded center cap on the wheels.\n\n\"We want people to see and recognize the same trust that they built in Waymo when they look at these vehicles,\" Karp said. \"What we found is people aren't as familiar with the Zeekr brand. So by naming it the Ojai, we're hoping to bring some of that same brand trust and familiarity to the rider experience.\"\n\nKarp said Waymo chose Ojai as a nod to the company's roots in California and to \"inspire a sense of tranquility.\"\n\nThe Ojai is shaped like a minivan but only seats four riders.\n\nKarp said that the Ojai is \"quite roomy\" and will have \"ample storage in the trunk.\"\n\n\"Once you get in, it is so spacious,\" she said. \"I'm not the tallest person in the room, but when I sit in the Ojai, I can really lean back, relax, stick my feet out. It feels like you're riding in first class.\"\n\nShe added that, as regulations change, there could be an opportunity to remove the steering wheel, allowing for another rider.\n\nWaymo's sixth-generation AI driver will have a reduced sensor suite.\n\nThe fifth-generation Waymo Driver, which drives the existing fleet of Jaguar I-PACE SUVs, has 29 cameras, six radars, and five lidars.\n\n\"Basically, we've taken our learnings from driving over a hundred million fully autonomous miles to inform our next generation sensor suite,\" she said. \"So simplified, cost-effective design that's able to scale to more cities, especially with diverse weather conditions.\"\n\nKarp told Business Insider that advancements in sensor technology allow Waymo to reduce the number of sensors.\n\nThe new lidar, for example, has \"higher density,\" or the ability to see further, the spokesperson said.\n\nThe sensor suite is also considerably less clunky.\n\nThe sensors on the roof of the Jaguars are stacked like a tiered wedding cake. The next-generation sensor suite removes the tier and integrates the 360-degree cameras more seamlessly.\n\nSeveral sensors attached to the sixth-generation Waymo Driver also come with sensor-cleaning mechanisms, including tiny windshield wipers and hidden spray nozzles.\n\nThese additions will help the new Waymo Driver perform in harsher weather conditions.\n\nThe Hyundai IONIQ 5 shares some resemblance to Waymo's retrofitted Jaguar.\n\nBoth cars are white, all-electric SUVs that seat four people. Business Insider took a ride in an IONIQ 5 with Motional, Hyundai's robotaxi venture, and found that the space inside the vehicle is similar to the I-PACE.\n\nThe IONIQ 5 will also share the same sensor suite with the Ojai, but will have a variance as to where the sensors are attached. The Hyundai at CES was a show car rather than the actual car that will be on the roads.\n\nKarp could not speak to the number of IONIQs and Ojais Waymo plans to roll out for the initial launch.\n\nJust like any other car, robotaxis don't last forever.\n\nOver time, Waymo will replace the Jaguars with the Hyundai and Ojai, Karp said, \"because you can only have a car running for so long.\"\n\nKarp said that Jaguar discontinued the I-PACE.\n\n\"We've always worked with several OEMs, so it allows us to scale our fleet,\" she said.",

    "description": "My grandmother lived to 99, and I'm glad I made time to get to know her as an adult. Her wisdom helped me see the world differently.",
    "fullText": "\"Do you think there is a heaven?\" my 99-year-old grandma, who was a devout Catholic, asked me one of the last times I saw her alive. It was June of 2019, and my mom and I had driven south to Dyersburg, TN, to visit her in the long-term care facility she had only recently been admitted to. This was a woman who had driven until she was 88 and lived independently since my grandfather died 10 years earlier at 91.\n\nGrandma was part of the Greatest Generation, prayed the rosary, and watched the Catholic channel daily on her 20-inch television. Every time we spoke on the phone, she would ask, \"Did you go to church today?\" She lived her faith by example.\n\nShe loved to play competitive card games and have an occasional sip of blackberry brandy as a nightcap. The fire and spunk I saw in her eyes when she sheepishly challenged me about an afterlife was a new side of her I began to see years earlier as we both grew older. I was in awe that she was both willing and able to question her faith in her tenth decade of life.\n\n\"There's no shame in being afraid,\" she once said to me. It was spring 2002, and her words caught me off guard. Relief was the initial feeling. I thought, \"Oh, now you tell me.\" I had spent my life running from my anxious nature, and her words were freeing. She was my maternal grandmother and would be called GGMa by my nieces and nephew, yet to be born.\n\nThe daughter of Lithuanian immigrants, she had grown up on a farm in central Illinois, and her life had been shaped by hardship, resilience, and a little mystery. She had always been a stoic taskmaster when she came to stay with my younger sister, brother, and me — and harder to get close to when we were kids. With these words, she conveyed a soothing wisdom I had never heard from her before.\n\nDespite GGMa's disciplined nature, she also had a wry sense of humor. Both she and my grandfather — who was quicker with a gentle smile and a joke— instilled a sense of joy and laughter in their three girls, which they passed on to my cousins, siblings, and me. Because I had missed the later years of my paternal grandmother's life due to college and travel, I was making an effort to spend time with my maternal grandparents. That they would live into their nineties was a gift.\n\nBack in Dyersburg, TN, I replied, \"I'd like to think there is a heaven, Grandma.\" I appreciated and even admired her blind faith and the respect she had for her small-town priest, who visited her regularly in long-term care. My reply was honest and my own, someone deeply spiritual but skeptical about how the Catholic rulebook she followed played out.\n\nWanting to get GGMa out of bed during our visit, I instigated an outing into the summer sunshine for a change of scenery. I had fun wheeling her through the rehab center while she directed me toward a door to escape the stale air, despite the staff's dedication to cleanliness. In the last picture I took of her, she wears my Maui Jim sunglasses, the midday sun on her face, and looks as much like herself as ever.\n\nWhen I arrived to visit her for the last time, she was sitting up on her knees in bed like a teenager, singing a hymn, smiling, and waving in rhythm toward the ceiling. She looked 30 years younger and was in a trance-like state, clearly communicating with someone. It was beautiful to watch, and I believe she received her answer about heaven.\n\nThinking about our last days together, I wonder if Grandma asked me about heaven less to question her own faith and instead, to encourage me to explore my own. If heaven truly does exist, she is definitely in it. What is certain is that I benefited deeply from the time we spent together as adults, and I'm grateful I made time to get to know her as the woman she was: faithful, fun, stubborn, anxious, and strong.",

They turned to Solskjaer after sacking Jose Mourinho in December 2018, later offering the Norwegian the full-time position after he lost only once in 13 league games in charge.\n\nThe club also hired Ralf Rangnick to lead the team for six months after Solskjaer's dismissal and Carrick's brief stint, but the Austrian struggled to implement his gameplan and battled with the hierarchy over recruitment - winning 11 games, drawing 10 and losing eight as the Red Devils finished sixth in the Premier League and without a trophy.\n\nUnited will be hoping Carrick can succeed in the same manner as Guus Hiddink, who delivered the FA Cup at Chelsea in 2009 as an interim, and Roberto di Matteo, who led the Blues to FA Cup and Champions League glory in 2012.\n\nBut what does an interim coach do? How is the job different to a full-time position? And is hiring an interim manager a good idea?",

In Arsenal's last league game against Liverpool, the forward only had eight touches and failed to take a shot, while he has scored just once from open play in the last 15 games.\n\nThe Gunners have not won the league since 2004 but are many people's favourites to lift the title - and if they manage to do it, it will be their first piece of silverware since 2020 when they won the FA Cup in Arteta's first season in charge.",

    "fullText": "Where there is Victor Osimhen for Nigeria, there is hope.\n\nThe 27-year-old striker and his Nigeria team-mates face hosts Morocco in the semi-finals of the Africa Cup of Nations on Wednesday, with five wins from five games so far.\n\nOsimhen is joint second in the tournament's top scorers list with four goals, level with Liverpool and Egypt's Mohamed Salah and one behind Morocco's Brahim Diaz.\n\nBut the tournament has not been plain sailing for Galatasaray striker Osimhen or the Super Eagles, with a high-profile on-field argument threatening to overshadow their impressive displays.\n\nHis spat with Ademola Lookman during the 4-0 last-16 win over Mozambique attracted plenty of headlines, with reports - which Nigeria have denied - even suggesting Osimhen had threatened to quit the camp.\n\nOsimhen confronted Lookman over his failure to pass the ball to him in a clear goal-scoring position and then signalled to manager Eric Chelle to replace him, which he duly did. Osimhen went straight down the tunnel at full-time, not taking part in the on-field celebrations.\n\nThe storm has since died down, with players - including Osimhen himself - and Chelle insisting any internal conflict had been squashed soon after the final whistle.\n\nBut people who know him best insist Osimhen would not be the same striker without that will to win and say any accusations of selfishness towards the striker could not be further from the truth.\n\nWith two goals needed to level the late Rashidi Yekini as Nigeria's record goal scorer with 37, Osimhen is on the brink of cementing his place in Nigerian football folklore.\n\nHe said: \"It doesn't matter if I equal the record or I surpass it. I think Mr Rashidi Yekini is the best striker the Super Eagles have ever produced.\n\n\"I'm just doing my best. Of course, it's amazing to be part of the history of the Super Eagles.\n\n\"So I'm just trying to win something important for my country. And I think with the help of my team-mates, I'm on that path.\"",

    "fullText": "There are moments in tennis when the crowd senses the tide turning long before the players do. And then there are moments – like the one that unfolded on a hot Wednesday afternoon in Melbourne, when even the player in control has absolutely no idea what’s coming next. Austria’s Sebastian Ofner thought he had sealed the second qualifier at the 2026 AO against Nishesh Basavareddy. But the 20-year-old American had other plans…\n\nUp 7-1 in the deciding super tie-break, the Austrian raised his arms, pumped his fist, and tapped the side of his head as if reminding the world of his mental edge. He strutted forward, basking in what he believed was a done deal. But the Australian Open‘s qualifying format has one brutal quirk: the third-set tie-break goes to 10, not 7. Ofner didn’t know it. And that moment of premature celebration was all Nishesh Basavareddy needed to swing open a door that had something firmly shut. Just over 10 minutes later, Ofner had lost 13-11 to the American and eventually got eliminated from qualification.\n\nThe match ended at 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (13-11) in favor of Nishesh Basavareddy. Now, coming to his celebration… well, instead of a muted reaction, Basavareddy turned toward the crowd, placed both hands around his throat, and delivered a deliberate “choke” gesture – pointed reference to Ofner’s early celebration and the unraveling that followed.\n\nIt was icy, unapologetic, and brutally symbolic! Even so, Sebastian Ofner met Basavareddy at the net for a handshake before trudging off the court. The mood was surreal: equal parts disbelief and secondhand embarrassment. Moments later, reactions started to pour in on social media.\n\nAmerican tennis journalist Ben Rothenberg tweeted, “Holy crap, he lost. After Ofner’s premature celebration, Basavareddy won eight of the next nine points, then hung on to take the tiebreak 13-11. Wildest ride of the Australian Open so far; should make for some viral videos…” Barstool Tennis didn’t hold back either, calling the whole episode “insanity.”\n\nPainfully for Ofner, this wasn’t new territory. In 2023 at Kitzbuhel, he led Alex Molcan 6-4, 5-0… only to lose seven straight games, drop the second set, and eventually lose the match in a tiebreak. Wednesday’s meltdown felt like deja vu, another match that slipped through his fingers just when it seemed secure.\n\nFor Nishesh Basavareddy, though, this was another showcase of the grit he’s been building on the big stage. Now, he moves on to face Britain’s George Loffhager in a bid to enter the main draw. Remember what happened last year?\n\nThere aren’t many young players who get a nod of approval from Novak Djokovic before stepping on court with him. And there are even fewer who manage to rattle the 10x AO champion once the match begins. But in 2025, Nishesh Basavareddy did both. Last year, he arrived in Melbourne as a wildcard, a teenager still trying to find his place in the crowded world of rising tennis talents. And guess what? He got the chance to face the 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic in his very first match.\n\nBut before the match, Djokovic was seen rating this youngster pretty highly. “I saw that he’s very quick. He’s a very talented player. He’s got great hands. He’s very dynamic. He can serve well, hit spots. Just a very complete game overall. Yeah, I mean, it’s going to be his, I guess, first time in the main draw of the Grand Slam, wild card, playing on the center court. Not much to lose. I’m sure that he is going to be really pumped to make a statement.”\n\nJust like what he said, Nishesh Basavareddy’s fearless start in this epic battle earned him the first set against the Serbian superstar. When the American took the opening set 6-4, the arena erupted. But then, Djokovic eventually steadied the ship and won the next three sets to wrap up the match at 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-2.\n\nAfter the match, Novak Djokovic even shared a heartfelt message for the youngster. “Well played, Nishesh Basavareddy, impressive slam debut.” Even tennis legend Mats Wilander spoke highly of the American.\n\nDuring his conversation on Eurosport, Wilander said, “First impression was brilliant. The technique was similar to Novak’s. The forehand was very similar. A better forehand than Novak had when Novak was at his age, because Novak struggled with his forehand early on. He moves well enough. He needs to get a little bit stronger. His serve, technically, I thought was good enough. So he has a bright future and another American youngster.”\n\nIf Novak Djokovic’s early praise was a prediction, Nishesh Basavreddy is already proving him right. How far do you think this young American can reach at the 2026 AO?\n\nThe post Nishesh Basavareddy Turns Heads With ‘Choke’ Celebration After Rival’s Error at Australian Open appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

But a steal and slam by Yessoufou halted the surge and deflated any hope of a comeback for the crowd at Gallagher-Iba Arena.\n\nFrom there, Baylor matched every Cowboys push with timely buckets. Agbim, who played all 40 minutes, hit a key 3-pointer to maintain momentum as the Bears coasted through the final stretch.\n\nYessoufou sealed the victory in the closing minutes, surpassing 20 points before Baylor closed out its first conference win of 2026.

    "fullText": "Mike Tomlin rumored to be a \"top\" candidate for AFC head coaching job originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nMike Tomlin shocked the NFL world by stepping down from his role as the head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nTomlin had been the head man in Pittsburgh since 2007, won a Super Bowl, and never had a losing record with the team. However, the team failed to advance in the postseason again this season, and it seems like it's time for a change.\n\nThere has been some speculation that Tomlin could take a year off, similar to what Mike Vrabel did after splitting with the Titans. However, what if the perfect job is available that Tomlin can't say no to?\n\nNFL insider Josina Anderson is reporting that Tomlin is a \"top\" candidate for the Miami Dolphins job. The Dolphins fired Mike McDaniel and could be looking for a more experienced option with their next hire.\n\n“‘John Harbaugh & Mike Tomlin are at the top of the (Miami Dolphins) wish list (at head coach),’ a league source said again just now. We’ll see…if the Dolphins can pull either off,” said Anderson. “It takes two to tango.\"\n\nAnderson was also reportedly told by a source that Tomlin \"would prefer to coach in a warm-weather environment, if it fits.\"\n\nAs Anderson mentioned, the Dolphins could be going hard after both Tomlin and John Harbaugh. Both coaches are experienced winners from the AFC North who are somewhat surprisingly available.\n\nThe Dolphins certainly need a fresh start. The team has not won a playoff game since the year 2000. The Dolphins made the playoffs in 2022 and 2023, but failed to get back to the postseason in 2024 or 2025.\n\nTomlin would immediately bring credibility to the Dolphins and would likely make some veterans want to play there.\n\nOf course, there's no guarantee Tomlin would want to start over in Miami. Sure, the weather is nice, but the Dolphins are in a terrible cap situation and are seemingly stuck with Tua Tagovailoa at quarterback.\n\nWould Tomlin prefer to just sit this season out and see what options are available next season? Regardless, it seems like the Dolphins are exploring all options and could be a major player in the market.\n\nMike McDaniel could be headed to the AFC North\n\nRobert Griffin III roasts Browns after disastrous season\n\nDid the Dolphins fire McDaniel because of Harbaugh?\n\nFalcons listed as top landing spot for elite head coach\n\nAre the Cardinals the worst HC job in the NFL?\n\nPete Carroll could be replaced by elite college coach",

After falling from the AP Top 25 following a second loss in their first three Big 12 games, the Jayhawks roared away from the stunned Cyclones the moment the ball was thrown up.",
    "fullText": "LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) — Kansas finally showed what it could do with a healthy Darryn Peterson and a regular rotation Tuesday night.\n\nThe timing couldn't have been worse for second-ranked Iowa State.\n\nAfter falling from the AP Top 25 following a second loss in their first three Big 12 games, the Jayhawks roared away from the stunned Cyclones the moment the ball was thrown up. Tre White hit four early 3-pointers and went on to score 19 points, Peterson contributed 16 before more cramping issues, and Kansas coasted to an 84-63 victory over previously unbeaten Iowa State.\n\n“This is more what I envisioned,” Jayhawks coach Bill Self said. “We've got an elite player — we got an elite scorer — and even tonight, when (Peterson) went to get his own, he can do some things other guys can't do. But the thing is the other guys are good players. We don't need to defer to him. I don't know that we've found that balance yet. But tonight was the closest thing to it.”\n\nMelvin Council Jr. added 15 points and Flory Bidunga had 10 for the Jayhawks (12-5, 2-2 Big 12), who led by 26 in the first half, had that advantage trimmed to 11 midway through the second, then answered with a 10-0 run to put the game away.\n\nIt was the kind of performance that college basketball fans have become accustomed to seeing from the Jayhawks over the years.\n\nMuch more familiar than recent losses to unranked UCF and West Virginia.\n\n“They were extremely well-prepared, well-coached, like we knew they would be,” Iowa State coach T.J. Otzelberger said. “Extremely urgent (for Kansas) to come out and play with a tremendous spirit, which they did, so credit to them.\n\n“That was an absolute beat-down,” Otzelberger added, “in their favor, unfortunately.”\n\nThere are a multitude of reasons for a stumbling start to the season, which had the Jayhawks in danger of their first 1-3 start to league play since the 1987-88 season. But the biggest may have been the cramping problems that had kept Peterson off the court for long stretches and kept the Jayhawks from getting into a rhythm even when he was available.\n\nHe was still massaging his calf on the bench Tuesday night, and at one point, Peterson grabbed it after going high for a dunk. But Self said the issue wasn't as serious as earlier in the year: “It was more of, ‘I’m not quite whole right now.'”\n\n“Feeling better. It's coming back slowly to me,” Peterson said. “I was out for a while but every game is getting better. This was a great win, especially coming off the loss to West Virginia. We knew we had to come out and get a win.”\n\nThe Jayhawks clearly felt a sense of urgency. They even had a players-only meeting — Self insisted he knew nothing about it — during which they talked about their goals for the season and what it would take to get back on track.\n\n“Just kind of reiterating the key things that we want to identify ourselves as this year,” White said, “and just internal conversations that made us more focused on what we want to do. It definitely made us more connected.”\n\nIt was evident from the opening minutes, when Kansas opened with an 11-3 run to get the crowd into the game.\n\nKansas pushed the lead to 26 points before Iowa State mounted its only real comeback, stringing together some stops and getting some buckets to go on each side of halftime. But eventually, the Jayhawks found their stride again, and they quickly pushed the lead back over 20 points before emptying the bench in the final minutes.\n\nWhat made the performance particularly impressive was the opposition: Iowa State was off to a 16-0 start, including a 23-point road win over then-No. 1 Purdue, and the Cyclones were one of two teams receiving No. 1 votes in the AP Top 25 this week.\n\n“We looked a little spooked and panicked, and the moment got to us,” Otzelberger said. “We know how well prepared they were going to be. We know how competitive they're going to be. We know how much confidence they have, especially in this building. You can tell they've been on the practice court working, and getting ready, and they did a tremendous job.”\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 all season.

    "fullText": "The Red Storm defied odds last season, winning the Big East regular-season championship and their first Big East Tournament title since 2000. But this year has been a different story. Rick Pitino’s side are 12–5 to start the season, they’ve fallen out of the rankings, and that comes with consequences.\n\nSt. John’s parted ways with general manager Matt Abdelmassih. He was long considered one of the most important figures behind St. John’s roster construction and transfer portal strategy. Abdelmassih had been on administrative leave since mid-December. According to journalist Roger Rubin of Newsday Sports, financial deals made by the General Manager had been under investigation in recent weeks, prompting his exit from the program.\n\nWhen Rick Pitino was asked about the situation, he had a rather cold response. “It’s out of my hands. I found out tonight. All I was told four days ago is look for another general manager. They said to me, ‘ don’t ask any questions.’ I said, ‘Okay, I’ll look for one.’ So, it’s really not a big deal,” Pitino said after the win against Marquette.\n\nHe continued, “What’s a big deal is making sure that we don’t lose anything. But that’s a university decision. I’ll abide by. They didn’t ask me my opinion, and I didn’t give it because they didn’t, and in their defense, they didn’t want to bother me. They didn’t want to distract me right now, and I appreciate that.”\n\nThe post Rick Pitino Offers Cold Reality Check After St. John’s Parts Ways With GM Abdelmassih appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "description": "Is Golden Boy Promotions headed for the same fate as Top Rank? From the looks of things, the possibility can’t be ruled out entirely. Vergil Ortiz Jr.",
    "fullText": "Is Golden Boy Promotions headed for the same fate as Top Rank? From the looks of things, the possibility can’t be ruled out entirely. Vergil Ortiz Jr., promoted by Golden Boy, and Jaron Ennis, who fights under Matchroom Boxing, have been in negotiations for a potential showdown since late 2025. However, the two sides have yet to finalize an agreement. And the cause appears to be Oscar De La Hoya.\n\nBoth fighters are reportedly eager to make the bout happen, and initial talks saw their respective promotions agree to a 50–50 purse split, with an additional 5% going to the winner. But negotiations hit another roadblock when Golden Boy head Oscar De La Hoya later demanded a revised 60–40 split in Ortiz’s favor. That move stalled the fight once again and has now drawn DAZN into the ongoing negotiations.\n\nAccording to veteran boxing journalist Dan Rafael, Golden Boy Promotions’ TV deal with DAZN has expired. And they are pressuring the promotion to make the Ortiz vs. Ennis fight to extend the contract. “I understand it this way: Golden Boy’s contract with DAZN is expiring and has not officially been renewed. To reach a new agreement, DAZN was putting pressure on De La Hoya with the demand to make the Ennis–Ortiz fight,” Rafael said on the Big Fight Weekend podcast.\n\nOscar De La Hoya, through his Golden Boy Promotions, first partnered with DAZN in October 2018. Since then, the retired world champion has come under scrutiny time and time again for his feuds with his own fighters. His infamous clash with former Golden Boy star Canelo Alvarez saw the two enter court, and Alvarez later even left the promotion. De La Hoya has also found himself at odds with Ryan Garcia on several occasions.\n\nIt’s yet to be seen whether De La Hoya caves to DAZN’s demands to let the fight between Ortiz and Ennis proceed with a 50-50 purse split. De La Hoya previously claimed that the promotion is looking elsewhere for an opponent for Ortiz Jr. In the meantime, however, Vergil Ortiz Jr.’s manager is growing impatient with De La Hoya’s demand, which is causing the delay in making the fight against Jaron Ennis a reality.\n\nVergil Ortiz Jr.’s manager, Rick Mirigian, pushed back against GB Promotions chairman Oscar De La Hoya after he claimed the company was “moving on” from a potential fight with Jaron Ennis. Speaking to BoxingScene, Mirigian made it clear the decision was not Golden Boy’s to make.\n\n“I have the right to negotiate with anyone,” Mirigian said. “They don’t have the authorization to say [the deal must be] 60% to 40%—60-40 of what? You can’t ‘move on’ when no one has spoken to us.” Mirigian stressed that Ortiz wants the fight and accused Golden Boy of presenting only one opponent and an inadequate financial offer.\n\n“We were given one number, and we gave a counter that was denied,” he explained. Rejecting claims that negotiations are over, Mirigian added, “We are not ‘moving on.’ We will negotiate. Vergil wants to make this fight, and so do I.”\n\nIt appears Golden Boy Promotions has found itself in a difficult spot. Although they want the most money for their fighter, which will, of course, benefit them as well, Ortiz Jr. seems adamant about facing Ennis. Plus, DAZN is breathing down their neck to make the fight happen. Do you think it will?\n\nThe post Boots vs. Ortiz Drama Puts Oscar De La Hoya’s DAZN Future at Risk appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "fullText": "Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship and Bare Knuckle Fight League are making their official entry into India, marking a significant expansion into one of the world’s largest combat sports markets.\n\nThe move is being spearheaded by World League of Fighters, BKFC’s license holder, which is co-founded by Rajesh Banga, Sunil Mathew and Siraj Gill. The organization has brought in prominent film producer Parag Sanghvi and Bollywood star and martial artist Tiger Shroff to join the board alongside BKFC founder and president David Feldman and former two-division UFC champion Conor McGregor, who became a part-owner of BFKC in 2024.\n\nMiss Universe Harnaaz Sandhu Joins Tiger Shroff, Sanjay Dutt in 'Baaghi 4' - Global Bulletin\n\nNetflix, Amazon Prime, ZEE5, SonyLIV Vie for India's IFFI Streaming Honor - Global Bulletin\n\nFox Orders Lifeguard Drama Series 'Rescue: Hi-Surf' from Producer John Wells (TV News Roundup)\n\nWLF previously delivered a sold-out BKFC event in Dubai last year, which the organization describes as the biggest bare-knuckle fighting event held in the Middle East.\n\nThe India expansion will introduce a team-based bare-knuckle league format – marking the first time such a structure has been implemented in the history of the sport. The format will feature six inaugural teams: Crushers, Punishers, Warriors, Phantoms, Gladiators and Infernos, transforming individual fights into a franchise-based competition.\n\nRahul Saxena has been appointed CEO to lead the platform. He brings experience in scaling global brands to the role.\n\n“India is not just a market – it is the future of global combat sports,” Banga, Mathew and Gill said in a joint statement. “Together with BKFC, BKFL and WLF, we are building an ecosystem that will develop Indian fighters, create global stars and deliver world-class fight entertainment to millions of fans.”\n\nSanghvi positioned the venture as an opportunity to build a sports intellectual property from India with global reach. “This is where world-class storytelling meets raw, uncompromising sport,” he said. “With WLF, BKFC and Conor McGregor, we are not just launching a league – we are architecting a global sports IP from India that will command attention, talent and fandom worldwide.”\n\nFeldman emphasized India’s longstanding position in the organization’s expansion strategy. “India has been on our roadmap for a long time,” he said. “The scale, the energy, the culture — there is no place like it. With the leadership team we have assembled and our partnership with WLF, we are bringing the purest form of combat sports to a nation ready for it.”\n\nMcGregor, who serves as a global partner for BKFC, framed the expansion as transformative. “India has warriors in its DNA,” he said. “What we’re building with BKFC and BKFL in India will be something the world has never seen before. This is not just expansion – this is a revolution.”\n\nShroff, joining McGregor as a board member, highlighted the cultural significance of the venture. “Honored to stand alongside Conor McGregor as we create something truly historic for Indian sport,” he said. “This is more than a fight – it’s a global movement, and history is being written. Just like cinema, sport is a celebration of talent and skill, and Parag [Sanghvi] and I are committed to turning this into a landmark moment for India.”\n\nThe first official BKFC and BKFL team-based events are scheduled for 2026, with venue and fight card details to be announced.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\nOscar Predictions: Original Screenplay — With Few Signals, 'Sinners' Takes an Early Lead\n\nOscar Predictions: ‘Sinners’ Could Shatter the All-Time Nomination Record as International Films Hope for Recognition\n\nNew Movies Out Now in Theaters: What to See This Week",

    "fullText": "Following Ruben Amorim’s sacking, quite a few plans have changed at Manchester United.\n\nA new caretaker in Michael Carrick has stepped in, new coaches have come in to assist him, and plenty of first-team stars will hope their fortunes will also change as a result.\n\nQuite a few players would have liked to have played more under the Portuguese, but their chances remained few and far between.\n\nKobbie Mainoo is one of them, so is Joshua Zirkzee. The Dutchman started a mere four games under the ex-Sporting CP boss.\n\nWith the World Cup coming up, he was desperate to play more in a bid to make the Netherlands team for the quadrennial showpiece.\n\nDespite interest from England, all signs pointed towards a return to Italy where AS Roma were pushing the hardest.\n\nIn fact, at one stage, the Giallorossi had even agreed on the outlines of a deal and agreed personal terms with the forward.\n\nHowever, INEOS blocked the deal, waiting for the caretaker to take the final call. And the final decision was that the 24-year-old would not be allowed to join the Serie A side.\n\nAnd as per SportsBoom, that has left the former Bologna ace devastated as he wanted a fresh start and had even told his inner circle he expected to be playing in the Serie A from January onwards.\n\n“Manchester United striker Joshua Zirkzee has been left disgruntled after his move to Roma collapsed, SportsBoom can exclusively reveal.\n\n“Sources close to the player have said the Dutch international expected to be a Roma player by the end of the window.\n\n“The move has been mooted for months with Zirkzee struggling to make his mark at the Red Devils since his £36.5million move to Old Trafford last season. And Zirkzee is said to be disappointed his future has been left in limbo.”\n\nJoshua Zirkzee has two goals and one assist this season and did not start a single game under interim boss Darren Fletcher.\n\nWith Benjamin Sesko back amongst the goals, and with Bryan Mbeumo and Amad also back, it will be interesting to see how many minutes he gets under Michael Carrick.\n\nFeature image Molly Darlington via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

The Panthers returned the favor by beating the Potters in the regular season finale and in the sectional championship on the way to finishing third at state.\n\nPenelope Drake scored nine points for the Potters but may have delivered the game’s biggest play when she blocked a three-point shot by Washington’s Avery Tibbs with 0:15 left as Washington was aiming to tie the game. Tibbs finished with a game-high 14 points.\n\nThe two teams will meet again on Feb. 10 in the final game of the regular season in Washington.\n\nOther girls basketball winners included Notre Dame, Richwoods, Normal Community, Normal West, Metamora, Canton.

They limited the Purple to just five points in the third quarter and Nassiff got herself some buckets, scoring eight points in the stretch to build a 42-20 lead heading to the fourth quarter.\n\nNassiff finished as Moses Brown’s top scorer with 23 points. Bousquet was right behind her with 21 points and Adelaide Crosby and Madison Wilson accounted for the remaining seven points.\n\nJaydell Harris was the top scorer for Classical, putting up 12 points. Daniella Jimenez had seven in the loss.\n\nCranston West’s offense was feeling good on Tuesday night.\n\nThe Falcons made seven 3-pointers … in the first quarter against the Rebels. The early shooting led to a 28-point frame as Cranston West toppled South Kingston, 74-36, on the road in a Division I matchup.\n\nCranston West finished with 13 treys in the game with Talya Walker (19 points) making five from distance. Kyla Buco (18 points) was right behind her with four makes from beyond the arc. Walker and Buco each made three triples in the opening frame.\n\nSaniyya Chase scored a dozen points and Madeleine Marques added 11 in the victory. It was the Falcons’ best offensive game of the season by a wide margin as the Falcons hadn’t broken 60 points yet this season. Might Tuesday’s win spark a run for Cranston West?\n\nAn important matchup with Westerly awaits on Saturday at home.\n\nIt was close all night, but Chariho pulled out a nailbiter vs. St. Raphael in Division I play.\n\nThe Chargers carried just a 6-point lead into the break and that was enough to hold off the Saints behind Tessa Aiello’s 16 points. With scoring contributions from six different players, the Chargers used their balanced attack to secure their fourth win of the year.\n\nMenuhki Harris managed a dozen points and had 10 fouls shots in the game as the junior was tough to defend. The Chargers added six points from the line in their decisive 14-point fourth quarter that helped keep them ahead.\n\nAdrianna Noka supplied eight points in the win. Tuesday was a key win at home for the Chargers as they travel to Westerly on Thursday night for a rivalry match. Chariho could play upset against the Bulldogs, who are looking like one of the best teams in the state to start the year.\n\nSRA was paced by 16 points from Carolyn Abreu. The Saints host West Warwick on Thursday.\n\nGenesis Castro scored a team-high 18 points, including 4 buckets from beyond the arc, and teammates Ella Martin and Faith Van Ness added 13 and 11 points, respectively, in the Eagles victory, as Barrington is now 10-1 and ranked second to only Westerly in Division I.\n\nFor the Patriots in the loss, Annie Hurd scored 16 points with 2 threes, Violet Silvia acced 11 points and 3 treys, and Gyselle Mairs finished with 10 points and 2 threes. Portsmouth slips to 5-2 on the season.\n\nThe Skippers wasted little time in dispatching the Rams in his Division I clash, racing out to a 24-3 advantage and playing a solid defensive game to cruise to victory. Brooke Faunce led the way with a game-high 16 points and Mya Macchioni added 8 more as North Kingstown pushed its record to 6-3 with its second win over La Salle (2-8) this season.\n\nFor the Rams, Maya Fernandes led the team with 6 points as La Salle gears up to face Portsmouth later this week.\n\nWesterly continues to prove it’s one of the state’s best programs.\n\nThe Bulldogs handled Pawtucket comfortably in a 65-23 victory on Tuesday night at home. Westerly assisted on 24 of its 27 field goals with Macy Antoch’s 14 points pacing the group. The freshman also supplied four rebounds and four steals in a standout night in the Division I matchup.\n\nDanica Jarrett was right behind her teammate with 13 points, five rebounds and a trio of steals. Cece Saint rounded out Westerly’s scorers in double figures with 10 points. But the standout performers don’t end there. Santanaa Hamelin supplied seven assists and seven steals as the freshman was all over the court.\n\nThe young, and talented, Bulldogs are now 9-1 overall on the year and host Chariho on Thursday.\n\nEast Providence girls basketball rebounded in a big way Tuesday night.\n\nThe Division II Townies managed a season-high 57 points in their 57-43 victory against Division I’s West Warwick. The win comes on the heels of EP losing to Rogers last Friday.\n\nZarae Hall got East Providence started hot with 14 points in the first half and finished off the Wizards with 24 in the game. The junior made 10 shots from the field, including a trio of 3-pointers to push EP to its fifth win of the season.\n\nTrinity Provencher added a dozen points, including eight in the fourth quarter to close out the hosts. Audrey Bernard supplied another dozen points as EP’s offense was firing on all cylinders. East Providence travels to Tiverton on Friday.\n\nWest Warwick was led by Brea Lima’s 18 points and Alexa Foley’s 14.The Wizards meet St. Raphael on Thursday in Pawtucket.\n\nThe Vikings believe in the old adage that you only get one chance to make a first impression. So opening the game with a 17-point first quarter, and then adding 18 in the second was pretty indicative of how this Division II contest would play out.\n\nRogers started hot and stayed that way. They were paced by the dynamic duo of Zaida Aponte – 21 points, including four 3's – and Tameka Robertson – 14 first half points. The result was a 35-17 lead by the break and an easier second half.\n\nFor the Mariners, Taylor Sullivan and Delaney Bonneau each scored 11 points, with Sullivan making a pair of 3-pointers and Bonneau going 6-fo-6 at the foul line.\n\nRogers moves to 4-2 and will have a stiff test coming later this week when it faces first-place Coventry (8-1).\n\nFreshman Eveisha Santana had a night to remember as she poured in 26 points, 6 from beyond the arc, pulled down 8 rebounds and had 5 steals and 4 assists to lead the Knights to a win over the Villa Novans. Also factoring in the win was Keeana Palmer who had 8 points, 5 boards, 3 steals and 4 assists. Central improved to 7-1 on the season.\n\nSkyla Caro topped Woonsocket in scoring with 11 points and teammate Akira Moise added 8 points in the loss.\n\nLincoln School 53, Mt. Hope, 29\n\nThe Cavaliers made it two in a row on back to back nights, matching last season's win total (three) in the young season. Juanita Sanchez was up 39-21 at the break and was never threatened in the second half\n\nThe Cavs were led by Geston Richardson with 25 points and Corey McClain, who added 17. Amaree Gomes and Allen Ortiz also scored in double figures in the win. The Patriots were led by James Nute (11 points) and Josh Morales (10).\n\nSmithfield 47, North Kingstown 40\n\n200 medley relay: Westerly - Enzo Gynther, Brady Casady, Sam Lorello, Colby Champlin, 1:57.38; 200 free: Westerly - Cooper Palumbo, 2:09.88; 200 IM: NP/S/NS - Mason Smith, 2:28.65; 50 free: Westerly - Champlin, 2:14.91; 100 fly: NP/S/NS - Sean Mania, 57:07; 100 free: Westerly - Lorello, 1:00.50; 500 free: NP/S/NS - Mason Smith, 5:52.82; 200 free relay: Westerly - Juan Aquino, Josue Aquino, Casady, Champlin, 1:56.85; 100 back: Westerly - Gynther, 1:07.82; 100 breast: NP/S/NS - Mania, 1:12:28; 400 free relay: NP/S/NS - Mania, Connor Farrell, Joshua Mesick, Smith, 4:00.43\n\n200 medley relay: NP/S/NS - Patty Oussi, Alexa Cortes, Emily Pace, Lauren Riley, 2:11.33; 200 free: Westerly - Avery Lamb, 2:20:38; 200 IM: NP/S/NS, Alexa Cortes, 2:26.37; 50 free: Westerly, Sonja Beasley, 26:20; 100 fly: NP/S/NS, Oussi, 1:09.45; 100 free: Westerly, Beasley, 58:08; 500 free: Westerly, Olivia ONeil, 6:07:11; 200 free relay:  Alexia McCabe, Peyton Pietraszka, O’Neil and Beasley, 1:52:50; 100 back: NP/S/NS, Oussi, 1:10.93; 100 breast: NP/S/NS, Cortes, 1:15.65; 400 free relay: Westerly - O’Neil, Lamb, McCabe and Beasley, 4:12:03.\n\nHannah Hochman had two wins in two individual events (100 Free, 100 breaststroke) and she also participated in the winning 200 Medley Relay, and teammate Samantha Lin also had two individual victories (200 IM, 100 butterfly) and she also swam a leg on the winning 200 Medley Relay helping the Titans edge the Patriots.\n\nFor Pilgrim, Juliana Kavanaugh also captured two individual events (200 free, 100 backstroke) she swam a leg for the winning 400 freestyle relay.\n\nClassical vs. Hendricken at Al Morro Athletic Complex, 6 p.m.\n\nChariho at Narragansett, 6 p.m.\n\nAchievement First (PVD) vs. Hope at 85 Garfield Ave. Cranston, RI, 6:30 p.m.\n\nJohnston at Burrillville, 6:30 p.m.\n\nMt.

    "fullText": "It didn’t take long for American Fork to get rolling in its Region 3 rivalry matchup with Lone Peak on Tuesday. The offense was hot, and the Knights struggled to stop it as American Fork rolled to a 77-63 home win.\n\nThe Cavemen went to the basics early and drove into the paint. American Fork didn’t need many outside shots to build its early 19-11 lead.\n\nThe lead only grew from there after Lone Peak attempted a full-court press and double-team heavy defense. Possession after possession, American Fork broke down the defense with smart passes, mostly through the high post.\n\nCenter Jax Clark made his presence known early by pulling in rebounds and getting easy buckets at the rim.\n\nThe Cavemen were playing fast and free, and nearly everyone on the court was getting action. American Fork sophomore Dieter Tuitavuki especially played well off the bench with 14 bench points, which includes three 3-pointers.\n\nSam Rutter, a smaller guard on the court, got an offensive rebound, putback, and then took a charge on the following defensive possession.\n\nThe fast and free offense even gave American Fork ample opportunities from beyond the arc, and the offense hit four in the second quarter alone.\n\nIt was plays like that which gave American Fork a dominant 39-18 lead at halftime.\n\n“We came out really hungry early, and we were aggressive, and we shot shots,” said American Fork head coach Ryan Cuff. “One thing about what you do when you press is that you get teams to continue to shoot shots and try to shoot out of it. I thought there were some shots that were rusty, but a lot of our shots were still layups. We controlled the tempo a little bit that way.”\n\nLone Peak continued its press-heavy defense into the second half with more success, but more importantly, it was finally hitting shots. Knights’ guard Saxon Young struggled with his shot at points of the game, but hit two threes in the third quarter.\n\nThe Knights’ offense scored 24 in the third quarter, but American Fork kept chugging along with 20 of its own. Utah State commit Bryce Mella played especially well by getting to the rim, scoring efficiently, and ended the night with 21 points.\n\nThe field goals were much harder to come by in the fourth quarter thanks to the Lone Peak defense, and for the first time since the first half, Lone Peak cut it to single digits.\n\nThat problem was made worse with errors at the free-throw line. However, American Fork made sure to seal the win by continuing to fight through the press and getting to the free-throw line.\n\n“They fought hard and give (Lone Peak) credit,” Cuff said. “We get up, and the thing that’s scary about getting up, you don’t want to celebrate. Not that we did, but sometimes you get that lead, and now you’re trying to protect it. I was proud of us. We kept attacking. We got layups when they were there.”\n\nThe win already gives American Fork sole control of the top spot in Region 3, but there’s still a lot of season to go. It beat Lehi in its region opener last week and will play Corner Canyon on Friday.",

    "fullText": "Ja Morant might be on the trade block and if so, will arguably be the hottest commodity on the market, with a host of teams reportedly willing to bring him on board. Of course, there is no certainty about where he will land, but Bam Adebayo may have just spoiled it for those who enjoy sudden bombshells dropped on social media.\n\nAdebayo hit a clutch three-pointer from the left wing that ultimately helped the Miami Heat beat the Phoenix Suns 127-121 on Tuesday night, and he celebrated by seemingly calling Morantover to South Beach. He copied Morant’s “grenade” celebration.\n\nWhen Morant first introduced the controversial celebration, he mimicked pulling the pin from a grenade and tossing it toward the crowd, then followed it up by covering his ears. The pin gesture eventually stopped, but the ear-covering did not. And Adebayo did just that.\n\nIt did not take long for the NBA community to realize that it was a nod to Ja, or at least that is what the majority believed. Morant’s celebrations are unique and not something others resort to on a daily basis. So, Adebayo doing it at a time when it is common knowledge that Morant could be on his way out of Memphis makes the idea that he is trying to lure Morant to Miami seem extremely plausible.\n\nThere have also been strong rumors linking Morant to the Heat, with NBA journalist Rachel Nichols even revealing that the franchise is interested in him. It would be an intriguing addition and would certainly inject some life into a Heat team that needs inspiration heading into the postseason.\n\nOn the other hand, Zach Lowe has explicitly stated that the Heat don’t want to sign the controversial superstar.\n\nMorant himself has not commented on the Heat at all. It remains to be seen whether these are merely murmurs or something more concrete, because a grenade celebration alone cannot determine a trade.\n\nAfter all, Jaren Jackson Jr. of the Grizzlies did the same celebration in Memphis’ last game. That does not mean Morant will now want to remain in Tennessee.\n\nThe post Bam Adebayo Hit With “Recruitment” Allegations After Hitting Ja Morant’s Celebration Amid Trade Rumors appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "MILWAUKEE (AP) — Giannis Antetokounmpo couldn’t remember hearing boos from his home crowd during his brilliant 13-year career in Milwaukee.\n\nIt happened Tuesday midway through the Bucks’ 139-106 loss to a Minnesota Timberwolves team that was playing without Anthony Edwards and Rudy Gobert.\n\n“I’ve never been a part of something like that before,” Antetokounmpo said after the game. “Something new for me.”\n\nThe two-time MVP responded the same way he has whenever he’s been booed on the road. After making a driving layup and drawing a foul in the opening minute of the third quarter, Antetokounmpo offered a thumbs-down gesture and booed back.\n\n“When I get booed, I boo back,” Antetokounmpo said. “I’ve been doing it all season.”\n\nThose boos poured down after Milwaukee trailed 76-45 at the break. Never before in franchise history had the Timberwolves built such a big halftime lead in a road game.\n\nAntetokounmpo acknowledged the Bucks’ effort was low Tuesday. He also expanded on why the boos bothered him.\n\n“I don’t think it’s fair,” Antetokounmpo said. “But everybody has their opinion to do what they want to do. I’m not going to tell them what to do and how they should act when we don’t play hard or win, or we lose games or we’re not where we’re supposed to be. And I don’t think anybody has the right to tell me how I should act on the basketball court after I’ve been here 13 years and I’m basically the all-time leader in everything.”\n\nThe Bucks’ latest loss came as they approach the midway point of a season that hasn’t met their expectations.\n\nMilwaukee (17-23) is 11th in the Eastern Conference standings, meaning the Bucks would have to rally in the second half just to reach the play-in round of the postseason. That’s a precipitous fall for a team that has made nine straight playoff appearances and won the NBA title in 2021.\n\nThe Bucks’ precarious position means they can’t afford to have performances like the one they delivered against a short-handed Minnesota team Tuesday. Milwaukee coach Doc Rivers blamed it on “dead legs” after the game, noting the Bucks had just returned from a four-game trip and are about to go back on the road for their next two contests.\n\n“Dead legs cannot be an excuse,” Antetokounmpo said. “We have to be better.”\n\nAntetokounmpo noted that the improvement must start with him, though he delivered 25 points, eight rebounds and five assists on Tuesday. He was asked how the Bucks could step up in the second half to put themselves back in playoff position.\n\n“Playing hard,” Antetokounmpo said. “Playing the right way. Playing selfless basketball, which we don’t. I don’t know. I really don’t know. Those three things are important. I know that they’re important for you to win. Right now there’s so many things that we can do better. Let’s just start by, ’Can we just play harder? Can we just play the right way? Can we create advantages for the next player? Can we just play for our teammate, play for the team, play for ourselves?' Let’s start with that, and I think everything will follow.”\n\nAntetokounmpo has offered similar messages after other losses this season, but the Bucks still haven’t put it all together. They haven’t won more than two straight games at any point this season.\n\n“Maybe we are not connected as much as we should,” Antetokounmpo said. “Maybe my voice is just a broken record and guys are just tired and guys might tend to do what they want to do. I don’t know. But as a leader, it doesn’t matter. Being a leader is the same thing as being a dad. You have to keep on being available, being consistent with your words and your actions over and over and over again. One day you hope the message is going to go through.”\n\nIn the meantime, Antetokounmpo says he will keep responding to boos the same way, no matter who’s doing the jeering.\n\n“I thrive through adversity,” Antetokounmpo said. “I thrive when people don’t believe in me. Doesn’t matter if I’m on the road, if I’m at home, if I’m at my family dinner, if I’m at a practice facility against my teammate.”\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

    "title": "Zach Hyman's Bizarre Scoring Streak: Three Goals, Eight Inches From The Net",
    "description": "Zach Hyman has been doing nothing but score lately. The catch? It's been in the strangest ways possible.",
    "fullText": "Zach Hyman has been doing nothing but score lately. The catch? It's been in the strangest ways possible.\n\nAgainst Chicago, he kicked the puck off his thigh and into the net. It was waived off, but still. Against Nashville tonight, he added two power play goals, both from right on top of the crease. His last three goals have come from a combined total of eight inches away from the net. He's not sniping from the circles or roofing backhands from the slot. He's camping in the blue paint, getting whacked, cross-checked, and somehow finding ways to jam pucks past goalies.\n\nFourteen goals in his last 17 games. That's a lot of production from a guy who wasn't scoring much at all early in the season after returning from injury.\n\nBut the Edmonton Oilers weren't worried. Not even a little bit.\n\nThe organization has analysts doing every job imaginable, tracking every stat any fan could ever want to know. One of those stats is expected goals—basically, a measure of the quality of scoring chances a player is generating based on shot location, type, and situation. And when Hyman wasn't scoring early on, his expected goals said he should have been. He was getting chances. High-quality chances. The puck just wasn't going in.\n\nKris Knoblauch had a simple take on it: Hyman was overdue, and when it started happening, watch out.\n\nFrom Rink Rats To NHLers: The Dad Trip Brings It Full Circle The <a href=\"https://thehockeynews.com/nhl/edmonton-oilers#google_vignette\">Edmonton Oilers</a>' dad trip started in Chicago yesterday and wraps up tonight in Nashville. It's one of those NHL traditions that doesn't get enough attention from the outside, but for the players and their fathers, it's special in a way that's hard to put into words.\n\nTurns out Knoblauch makes the big bucks for a reason. He was right. Once Hyman broke through, the floodgates opened. Now he can't stop scoring, even if those goals come from the most unglamorous spots on the ice.\n\nThat's Hyman's game. He doesn't score highlight-reel goals from the hashmarks. He scores garbage goals. Net-front scrambles. Deflections. Rebounds. Pucks that trickle through the goalie's pads while he's being cross-checked in the spine. It's not glamorous, but it works. Fourteen goals in 17 games proves that.\n\nUnfortunately, last night it wasn't enough. The Oilers played sloppy against Nashville. Turnovers they'd love to have back. Defensive breakdowns that cost them. Hyman did his part—two power play goals, both from right on top of the net—but the team couldn't overcome their own mistakes.\n\nOilers at Nashville: Pre-game Stats 23-16-7 | 53 PTS\n\nStill, Hyman's recent stretch is a reminder of what he brings to this team beyond just goals. He fights. He finishes checks. He screens goalies until they can't see anything. He gets to the net. He parks himself there and refuses to move. Honestly, if Connor McDavid asked him to throw on the goalie gear, he'd probably do it without hesitation.\n\nThat's the value of Zach Hyman. He does whatever it takes. When he wasn't scoring early in the season, he was still doing all the other stuff—forechecking, creating space for McDavid, battling in corners, killing penalties. The goals weren't coming, but the effort never wavered. And the Oilers knew, based on the underlying numbers, that eventually the puck luck would turn.\n\nBetter Than Advertised: Ingram's Play Forces Tough Questions in Edmonton Connor Ingram's performance Monday night against the Blackhawks was something else. When the <a href=\"https://thehockeynews.com/nhl/edmonton-oilers#google_vignette\">Edmonton Oilers</a> traded for him, I'll be the first to admit it: I didn't think he was the answer. I still don't think he's some saviour who's going to single-handedly carry this team to a Cup. But he's proven to be better than what we all gave him credit for. He can come in and win games for Edmonton. He's reliable. He's steady. He's the kind of goaltender that doesn't make Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl worry about what's happening behind them.\n\nExpected goals are a useful tool because they cut through short-term variance. Sometimes players go through stretches where they can't buy a goal despite doing everything right. Other times, players go on heaters that aren't sustainable based on the quality of their chances. Hyman's early-season drought was the former. His current run is the payoff. He was generating quality chances all along; now they're actually going in.\n\nAnd they're going in from ridiculous distances. Three goals from a combined eight inches away. That's absurd. He's made a living this season out of being in the exact spot goalies hate most: right on top of them, stick on the ice, ready to bang home anything that comes near the crease.\n\nThe Oilers need that. McDavid and Draisaitl can create offence from anywhere on the ice, but having a guy who's willing to pay the price in front of the net is invaluable. Hyman absorbs punishment, battles through cross-checks, and still finds ways to get his stick on pucks. It's a skillset that doesn't always show up in highlight packages, but it wins games.\n\nLike Father, Like Son: Leon Draisaitl's Hockey DNA Runs Deep Leon Draisaitl is one of the best players in the NHL. He's a perennial Hart Trophy candidate, a scoring machine, and Connor McDavid's partner in crime on one of the most dangerous duos in hockey. But before all that, he was just a kid hanging around the rink, watching his dad play.\n\nThe other night in Nashville, it almost did. Two power play goals from Hyman, both from his office right on the goal line. But sloppy play elsewhere cost the Oilers. Sometimes that happens. The good news? Hyman's rolling. Fourteen goals in 17 games, with no signs of slowing down.\n\nKnoblauch called it. Hyman was overdue. Now he's cashing in. And as long as he keeps parking himself inches from the net, the goals will keep coming—no matter how weird they look.\n\nBookmark The Hockey News Edmonton Oilers team site to never miss the latest news, game-day coverage, and more.   Add us to your Google News favourites, and never miss a story.",

    "description": "Seton Hall hosted UConn Tuesday night.",
    "fullText": "UConn coach Dan Hurley has won two of the last three NCAA Tournaments and believes he has yet another team capable of cutting down the nets in April in Indianapolis.\n\nYet there’s one team he wouldn’t want to see in the first round of the Big Dance: his alma mater.\n\n“I wouldn’t want to see Seton Hall’s name drawn next to mine in the NCAA Tournament, I’ll tell you that,” Hurley said after his No. 3 Huskies snapped a four-game losing streak in Newark with a 69-64 win over the No. 25 Pirates.\n\n“That’s an excellent team,” added Hurley, whose own team (17-1, 7-0 Big East) has won 13 straight dating to a Nov. 19 loss to current No. 1 Arizona. “That’s a team that’s going to be right there for the Big East regular season, Big East Tournament. And that’s going to be a tough team to beat in the NCAA Tournament.”\n\nFinal: No. 3 UConn 69, No. 25 Seton Hall 64\n\nThe Huskies snap a 4-game losing in Newark and Alex Karaban gets his 1st win here\n\nThe Hall proved they can hang with one of the best teams in the country after getting down double-digits\n\n— Adam Zagoria (@AdamZagoria) January 14, 2026\n\nAfter falling behind yet again in a Big East game and trailing by as many as 18 in the second half, the Pirates closed to within 65-64 on a corner 3-pointer by Mike Williams.\n\nWilliams (16 points) had another look to tie the game at 67, but was blocked by Braylon Mullins.\n\nThe Hall had no answer for 6-11 big man Tarris Reed Jr., who went for 21 points and 11 boards against the smaller Pirates front line. Karaban added 13 points in his first win at Prudential Center, and Mullins 11.\n\n“I’m just proud we got a Big East win and it’s definitely nice to win here,” Karaban said.\n\nThe good news for the Pirates (14-3, 4-2 Big East) is they roared back yet again after getting down early.\n\nThe bad news is they missed 10 foul shots (15-of-25) and were a woeful 1-of-16 from deep.\n\n“I don’t know, man,” Pirates coach Shaheen Holloway lamented. “I mean, here’s the craziest thing. In our new gym, our great, beautiful practice facility, we don’t miss free throws. We don’t miss 3-pointers. We can’t seem to make them [in games], so I don’t know.”\n\nThe Hall’s emotional leader, Budd Clark, fouled out with 12 points and 4 rebounds but wasn’t feeling any moral victories after giving the No. 3 team in the nation a serious run for its money.\n\n“We’re not here for moral victories,” Clark said. “We feel like we could beat anybody.”\n\nStill, Holloway knew this was a golden opportunity for a “massive” NCAA Tournament resume and league win that slipped away.\n\n“It’s disappointing because opportunities like this don’t come around too often at home,” he said.\n\nThe Hall needs to get some wins during the season against UConn, St. John’s and Villanova, the league’s other three top teams. So far they are 0-2 against Villanova and UConn with a date against St. John’s coming up Tuesday at Madison Square Garden after a home tilt Saturday with Butler.\n\n“Everybody doubts them and they continue to stay together and be the toughest,” UConn’s Karaban said of The Hall. “… They block out the outside noise every single year and it’s always a tough team to play against.”\n\nHolloway appreciated Hurley’s high praise for his team, but said he’s not getting too far ahead of himself.\n\n“I’m just worried about Butler,” he said, “I’m not worried about the NCAA Tournament.”",

    "fullText": "The Oklahoma City Thunder finally picked up their first win against the San Antonio Spurs, and it took them four games to do it. The defending champions breathed a huge sigh of relief after avoiding a regular-season sweep, but Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, true to his confident self, declared that the game was not as important as the external noise made it seem.\n\nBefore the Thunder’s first loss to the Spurs, they looked seemingly unbeatable, barring flukes. But Victor Wembanyama and company exposed glaring flawsand showed the league that beating them was possible. Gilgeous-Alexander, after finally avoiding defeat against the Frenchman, admitted that the Thunder did not see this coming.\n\nThe Spurs made them uncomfortable, but the reigning MVP feels that it was how they grew as a team. That’s what ultimately led them to their 119-98 win earlier today.\n\n*“They got the better of us the last three times we played them [and] that doesn’t happen to this group,”* Gilgeous-Alexander said.* “I can’t remember the last time its happened. But yeah, uncomfortable feelings and adversity is where you find growth that defines who you are.”*\n\n“And we showed that tonight,” the Canadian star added, before taking a dig at the magnitude of the occasion for the Spurs.\n\n*“Tonight wasn’t our super bowl. It wasn’t anything but another game in an 82 game season. We gotta [keep] finding ways to be better.” *\n\nWas this Gilgeous-Alexander trying to be nonchalant? Perhaps. Losing to a team four times in a regular season would have clearly shown the rest of the NBA that the Spurs were a true kryptonite for the Thunder. And although it does not matter in the long run, no team would want that next to its record.\n\nThe discussion will be over for now. The Thunder showed that they can beat the Spurs. Next, they may meet in the post-season where winning actually means more. If the Thunder fail there, Gilgeous-Alexander’s “this wasn’t our superbowl” comment would surely be revisited.\n\nThunder vs Spurs may very well be the NBA’s next big rivalry.\n\nThe post “Tonight Wasn’t Our Super Bowl”: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Trolls Spurs After 21-Point Blowout Win appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "description": "Dillon Brooks picked up his league-leading 14th technical foul on Tuesday, Jan. 13, which still leaves him work to do to set the single-season record.",
    "fullText": "Phoenix Suns guard Dillon Brooks picked up his league-leading 14th technical foul of the season on Tuesday, Jan. 13, and two more will lead to an automatic one-game suspension.\n\nThat seems inevitable, but making history will take work.\n\nBrooks leads Draymond Green and Luka Doncic, each who have nine technical fouls apiece this season. Yet Brooks must accelerate his pace to set the single-season technical fouls record.\n\nThat mark belongs to Rasheed Wallace, the retired center who amassed 41 technical fouls during the 2000-01 season when he was playing for the Portland Trail Blazers. Consider this: That means on average Wallace got whistled for a tech every other game during the 82-game regular season.\n\nBrooks’ latest tech came during the Suns’ 127-121 loss to the Miami Heat. That gives him 14 technicals through 40 games for an average of about one technical foul every three games. To catch Wallace, he’ll need 27 techs over the final 42 games of the regular season, an average of .64 technical fouls per game.\n\nEven if the record eludes him, Brooks has established himself as a player adept at drawing technical fouls. He had a career high of 18 technical fouls during the 2022-23 season when he was playing for the Memphis Grizzlies, and he has at least 11 technical fouls over each of the past six seasons.\n\nNot that all of them are deserved. That is, according to Brooks.\n\n\"They give me a (technical) for who I am,'' Brooks said after picking up his 13th technical foul against the Washington Wizards on Jan. 11, according to Sports Illustrated. \"That's weird and that's unappreciative.''\n\nBrooks will be facing a disadvantage Wallace didn’t during his record-breaking season.\n\nBefore the 2005-2006 season, the NBA implemented the rule that a 16th technical foul triggered an automatic one-game suspension. But during the 2000-01 season, Wallace drew whistle after whistle without worrying about an automatic suspension.\n\nThough Brooks has earned attention for his penchant for technical fouls, he’s helped lead the Suns (24-16) as the team’s second-leading scorer with 21.1 points per game and stellar defense.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Can Dillon Brooks break NBA record for technical fouls?",

It doesn't matter if I'm on the road, if I'm at home, if I'm on my family dinner, if I'm practicing with my teammate, it doesn't really matter.”\n\n“So, yeah, I've never been a part of something like that before, so it's something new for me. I like, though. I love it.”\n\nWhen asked about it a bit more, to clarify, Antetokounmpo was clearly offended by the fans who chose to boo him and his team and coaching staff.\n\n“I was definitely booing back. When I get booed, I boo back. I've been doing it all season. You guys haven’t been with me on the road,\" said Antetokounmpo, referring to local reporters who cover the Bucks at home but not road games. \"Whenever I get booed, I boo back.”\n\nBut this is home, this is different...\n\n“I does not matter,\" responded Antetokounmpo.\n\n“No, no, it does not matter. It doesn't matter, I play basketball for my teammates,\" said Antetokounmpo. \"I play basketball for myself and my family. When people don't believe in me, I don't tend to be with them. I tend to be against them. I tend to do what I'm here to do, what I'm good at, right?\n\n\"I think I'm like a maverick. I've always been that way, so won't change now, it doesn’t matter if I am home, away.\n\n“But, yeah, I've never been a part of something like that before, and I don't think it's fair. I don't.\n\n“But everybody has the opinion to do what they want to do; I'm not gonna tell them what to do or how to act when we don't play hard, we lose games, or maybe not where we're supposed to be.\n\n“And I don't think anybody has the right to tell me how I should act on the basketball court after I have been here 13 years. And I’m basically the all-time leader in everything.”\n\nThis was the sad ending of a game that the Bucks could not compete in on any level. Defensively, Milwaukee couldn't contest shots. Offensively, players could not match Minnesota's ability to score. I was one of the worst losses of the season, and that's saying something.\n\nThroughout Antetokounpo's return to play after an injured calf had sidelined him, he's been trying to take the most positive and authoritative tone in his post-game press conferences. He hasn't criticized his team, his coaches, the GM's roster or any decisions.\n\nBut this loss, a 139-106 thrashing, was so bad that coach Doc Rivers pulled his starters with 9 minutes to go, waiving the white flag. Milwaukee had just returned from a four game road trip and Rivers offered that as the reason for a completely lackluster performance for everyone.\n\nRivers' press conference was before Antetkounmpo spoke to reporters, and Rivers, simply said the reason was dead legs.\n\nBut Antetokounmpo wasn’t taking that free pass.\n\n“Effort was low for sure. It’s going to be nights like that in the NBA. I’ve been a part of not many, but I understand there’s going to be times that we might come out flat,\" said Antetokounmpo. \"And there's gonna be a team that going to come out with a lot of energy, should the crap out of the ball. And don't give you no life.”\n\nAgain, Antetokounmpo tried his best to be diplomatic by answering questions without shredding his teammates confidence.\n\n“I think we didn't play hard. I think we didn’t do the right things. We didn’t play as a team. There's not much you can take it from this game, either,\" said Antetokounmpo. \"You gotta, like, kind of... forget about it. Take the things you didn’t do well, try to improve on it. And go to the next one. But again, at the end of the day, effort was low, you cannot have that.\n\n“There's so many things that we can do better. But let's just start by... Can we just play harder? Can you just play the right way?”\n\nAgain, Antetokounmpo was pressed a bit on this issue. A team can lose because it is so fatigued there is nothing left in the body to compete with.\n\nOr, a team can lose because of it's own self sabotage, or, lack of effort.\n\n“I don't think it's dead legs. I don't think its dead legs. I don't think it's dead legs,” he said three times.\n\nAnd then he said it again. “Come on man.”\n\n“Were we tired? Yeah, yeah, a little bit. By the day, obviously. We wasn't on the gym. I don't see the reason. First of all, when I talk, I talk about myself too, right?\n\n“I always myself first. So I don't see the reason that I wasn't more aggressive, I wasn't defensively more aware. I wasn’t more, going down hill, making plays more. I don’t see the reason.\n\n“So, it's not dead legs. I'm never gonna say I didn't have legs. I’m always going to say that I could do things better. My effort wasn't there, maybe I wasn't as focused as I should. And then after that, when I look at myself, I look at over all the team, well, we can do better, but I don't think it's dead legs.\n\n“Dead legs can not be an excuse. We have to be better.”\n\nThis article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Giannis takes booing from Bucks fans personally, returns the gesture",

    "fullText": "Chelsea head coach Liam Rosenior has seemingly made a call about whether Cole Palmer will be playing tonight against Arsenal.\n\nAs we know, Palmer has been struggling with a groin issue for some time now, and recently, it kept him out for a good chunk of time.\n\nSince returning to the pitch, Palmer hasn’t quite looked the same confident top player that we have all grown used to seeing in a Chelsea shirt. And this had many wondering whether he is fully recovered yet or whether the injury might still be causing him some issues.\n\nAnd it looks like there might be something to the latter, because if Rosenior’s latest hints are anything to go by, Palmer will not be playing at all tonight, let alone starting, as Chelsea prepare to welcome Arsenal in the first leg of the League Cup semi finals.\n\nCole Palmer in action for Chelsea. (Photo by Shaun Botterill/Getty Images)\n\nSpeaking to the Chelsea website late last night, Rosenior said on Cole Palmer:\n\n“My job is to get to know him, to connect with him and to understand what gets the best out of him.\n\n“That takes time. I’m just super excited to work with him. The scary thing with Cole is that he’s already got world-class ability, but he’s just 23 years old.\n\n“He’s got so much more and there were moments of genius against Fulham; when he stepped over the ball to put Liam [Delap] in on goal, there was also a pass to Pedro (Neto) which was ridiculous. I can’t wait to work with him on a regular basis.\n\n“I had a really good in-depth conversation with Cole [on Monday], I’ve had a good in-depth conversation with the medical team, and we’re at a stage of the season where we’ve got another eight games in four weeks, so it’d be crazy for me to risk any player in this phase of the season.\n\n“I have real faith in this group and they showed that against Charlton. We made eight changes and we had a good performance. I’ll make more changes for Wednesday and I’ll make more changes on Saturday.\n\n“To risk a player’s health in January is a crazy thing to do if you have the ambition that you want to be strong at the end of the season.”\n\nWest Ham are reportedly interested in signing Chelsea goalkeeper Filip Jorgensen in the January transfer window.\n\nRio Ferdinand has demanded that Liam Rosenior changes this one thing in his attack moving forward, in his latest comments picked up by us.",

    "description": "An away trip to the East End of London was not always the most welcoming of prospects, but this game offered a little bit of everything that makes football such an experience in the broadest sense!",
    "fullText": "The 1977/78 season had not quite gone to plan for Jimmy Adamson. The unbelievable run-in to the previous season as we attempted to preserve our hard-won top-tier status – though in the end unsuccessful – had left many of us feeling we were only a couple of players away from having a squad good enough to return to the First Division at the first time of asking.\n\nFor the best part of the season our inability to put together successive victories as well as win away from Roker Park was a perplexing fact of this campaign. On a personal level being a regular at away games as well as Roker Park was a resilience- and stamina-building experience that has served me well into my older years as victories turned into draws and draws turned into defeats on the road!\n\nOrient were the opposition and Brisbane Road the venue as we ventured into 1978. I loved an away trip to London and Inter-City from Central Station was one of the more pleasurable modes of transport to a game (certainly knocking bells out of sitting on a crate in the back of a white van). Getting across London to whichever ground we were going to was the risky element of such trips but it all seemed worth it at the time and we were not to be disappointed on this occasion.\n\nGames against Orient I had generally found entertaining affairs. An added ingredient in this current Orient team was the marvellously talented winger John Chiedozie. Young, pacey, elusive and with a really good temperament the Nigerian international was a player to covet.\n\nHe also was one of the few wingers I saw regularly trouble one of my favourite ever full-backs Joe Bolton. I had been looking forward to seeing Joe pit his defensive wit and ferocious ability to put a flyer into the paddock if required before realising the day before the game that my cult hero was suspended and another handy youngster Tim Gilbert would take his place.\n\nOrient were no one-man team though and their manager Jimmy Bloomfield usually had them playing attractive attacking football. The leading goal-scorer in the second tier at that point was Peter Kitchen on fourteen goals. A Sunderland legend Stan Anderson had warned us in the local press in the run-up to this game to ignore him at our peril. He had sold him to Orient as Doncaster manager and rated him as a real threat. Glen Roeder would also play in the centre of defence; he was a stylish defender whose pace, positional sense and ability to use the ball well out of defence had always caught my eye when we played against him. Eire international Tony Grealish was a handful in midfield and Derek Clarke would also be in the O’s line-up. He was one of the five footballing Clarke brothers who always intrigued me. His brother Allan had played for Leeds against us in the 1973 FA Cup final and was probably the most successful of the quintet.\n\nBobby Fisher also played for Orient and apart from my youthful mistake in thinking he was also a Grand Chess Master this lad was often the victim of some brutal racist abuse; he was mixed-race and Jewish and to their detriment this seemed to especially aggravate some of the less tolerant who watched football at that time. Apart from being a handy enough full-back Fisher did not let the bigots hold him back; after his career in football he went on to become a TV actor (as well as an anti-racist campaigner) appearing in shows like The Manageress, Space Precinct and Star Hunter. Good on him!\n\nSunderland had their difficulties coming into this game. Ever-present Jackie Ashurst had gone down with flu so a late call-up was sixteen-year-old Rob Hindmarch. Coming from Morpeth I was especially chuffed at this debut; Ashurst would be a miss but Rob was from Stannington just outside of Morpeth and we were claiming him as one of our own “Morpeth Gadgies”.\n\nAnother player missing would be Mick Docherty (who had played his way into my affections since his transfer from Man City the previous season); a persistent knee injury was troubling the versatile leader on the park. Thankfully Bobby Kerr was back in the fold and would have a really good game to mark his return. Young forward and recent signing Roly Gregoire was added to the squad for this game and would be an unused substitute.\n\nMy journey from King’s Cross to Brisbane Road was typically not without its moments as traversing the underground, avoiding roaming bands of West Ham and Chelsea hoodlums and not for the first time falling into the trap of thinking once you are at King’s Cross you are almost at your destination all melded into an experience that would have prepared me as a contestant in Race Across the World had I the inclination today!\n\nOur away support in London games was always bolstered by exiles and there was close to two thousand of us making a bit of a racket as the game approached kick-off.\n\nMuch to our amusement a dog had gotten onto the pitch and was doing a marvellous job evading stewards, police and club officials to such an extent I contemplated writing to Jimmy Adamson to suggest the mongrel would make a handy addition to our forward line options.\n\nThe game had no sooner kicked off than it was stopped by the referee. To my initial excitement it looked like referee Tom Reynolds had sent the O’s keeper John Jackson off! At this point in the campaign I was ready to pounce on any advantage for my team and whilst cheering the “sending off” I freely admit I had no idea why this was the case. However notwithstanding my errant sense of fair-play it eventually became clear it was Jackson’s blue jersey which was the problem for the referee; it was clashing with our blue away jersey. Jackson returned to the field resplendent in a more traditional keeper’s jersey and to the satisfaction of the referee. In almost six decades of watching my team I had never seen this happen before or since.\n\nWith the game finally underway we made a really good start. With Bobby Kerr, Shaun Elliott, Wilf Rostron and Gary Rowell controlling midfield and Rob Hindmarch policing the dangerman Kitchen to good effect we had the majority of possession and moved the ball about the park smartly.\n\nAround thirteen minutes in Grealish misfired a pass straight to Bobby Kerr who looked up and played Gary Rowell into space as he raced into the box. Whether it was Grealish or Fisher who up-ended Rowell was hard to see from my position but the referee had no doubts about what the tackle deserved and awarded a penalty.\n\nThe season had started with Jackie Ashurst the nominated penalty taker; he had a thunderous shot and had scored a penna’ against Orient in the game at Roker Park earlier in the season. Gary Rowell had taken over the role and I had watched him score a penalty in three successive games in December. He looked nerveless taking these awards and combined unerring accuracy with a bit of power and as he picked himself up from the turf I was already anticipating taking a deserved lead in this game.\n\nThere was nothing in his run-up prior to this penalty that was any different to his previous successful attempts or anything different to any subsequent penalties (and I saw a number of them) that would account for him squeaking the ball the wrong side of the post. It was disappointing but unbeknown to us at the time it would be his sole penalty miss of twenty-six taken in his Sunderland career as he wrote himself into our record books with the most successful conversion rate of 96% in front of Tony Towers and Billy Clunas.\n\nThe game progressed with Sunderland still dominating the ball and looking the most likely team to score. The only real danger was coming from Chiedozie who was giving Mick Henderson and Tim Gilbert a bit of trouble as he alternated down either flank.\n\nWe arrived at half-time with no score courtesy of a couple of canny saves from Barry Siddall and an excellent interception from Hindmarch who had not given Kitchen a sniff in the first forty-five minutes. Despite our penalty miss I felt we were still well into this game; we just needed to get a little bit more from our front two of Lee and Holden!\n\nFor those that watched our two lanky strikers play together it is fair to say that Mel Holden was an out-and-out centre-forward. Bob Lee on the other hand offered a bit of variety as he would often drift into the midfield areas sometimes dragging his marker with him creating space for the likes of Gary Rowell and Wilf Rostron to “ghost” into. Lee was very tidy on the ball and whilst I sometimes felt he lacked a bit of aggression for a “big fella” he had some really nice touches and was utilised in midfield during his time with Sunderland.\n\nWithin minutes of the restart Wilf Rostron had seen two attempts go mighty close. A lob just cleared the crossbar and had Jackson scrambling and an angled shot pulled a cracking save out of the over-worked keeper.\n\nOn sixty minutes O’s manager Jimmy Bloomfield tried to change the pattern of the game by bringing off Derek Clarke and sending on experienced utility player David Payne to try and shore up the midfield. It did produce a change; on sixty-two minutes we scored! A Bobby Kerr corner kick was pinged into the box and produced a mighty melee with all our big men (Lee, Holden, Hindmarch and Jeff Clarke) in the eighteen-yard box. The ball eventually arrived at Jeff Clarke’s right foot about seven yards out from the back post. Like a seasoned forward he smashed the ball into the goal for his first ever Sunderland goal. We deserved this lead and boy did we celebrate it!\n\nThe game continued with Sunderland looking more likely to add to their lead when on seventy-three minutes there ensued one of the most bonkers five minutes of football I might have ever seen!\n\nIt started with Peter Kitchen who for just about the only time in the game eluded Rob Hindmarch, slalomed round Jeff Clarke and ran the ball into our net past a stranded Siddall for the equaliser.\n\nA minute later Gary Rowell danced along the eighteen-yard line before placing a sharp well-directed shot (a typical Gary Rowell shot from outwith the box) that nestled into the corner of Jackson’s goal to retake the lead and give him his twelfth goal of the season as well as make up for his penalty miss.\n\nWe were still celebrating Rowell’s cracker when an Orient corner kick seemed to evade a host of bodies as it somehow got to our back post. Moving smartly in the O’s best player on the day Chiedozie tapped the ball into our net for the equaliser.\n\nIt was an incredible passage of play and it wasn’t finished yet as almost straight from the kick-off the ball worked its way through Elliott, Kerr and Rowell to Bob Lee approximately eight yards out. He absolutely hammered a shot that looked a certainty and had my arms aloft in the away end only for Jackson to pull off another cracking save.\n\nFor the last fifteen minutes we did everything but score as Kerr put a good shot just over the bar and Mel Holden executed a perfect scissors kick that just grazed the bar. Holden looked like the most graceful giraffe you ever saw doing ballet as he pivoted and leapt; it was astounding to behold!\n\nThen another fantastic passage of interplay saw Bobby Kerr zip a low cross into the box for Gary Rowell to meet it almost horizontally (a typical Gary Rowell diving header) that Jackson just got a fingertip to. It was a breathtaking finale as the game finished with Orient perhaps a tad lucky to get a share of the points.\n\nThe Lads had played really well but actually dropped a position to eleventh in an eventful game that saw Jeff Clarke score the first of his six goals for us in a highly regarded Sunderland career and Gary Rowell miss the only penalty of the twenty-six he took for Sunderland.\n\nAs for the young debutant and Morpeth Gadgie Rob Hindmarch went on to become Sunderland’s youngest ever captain at nineteen years old. He was a hard centre-half who had all the attributes of a top-class defender: good aerial strength, strong tackler, fairly quick across the grass and a good ability to clear his lines. He allied all these skills with a cracking attitude to the game and a real leader on the pitch. In 1978 he would earn five England Youth caps and go on to make one hundred and twenty-eight appearances for the Lads ninety-one of these in the top tier as he became an intrinsic part of the team and defence for five seasons.\n\nIn 1984 new Sunderland manager Lenny Ashurst decided he could do without the services of Hindmarch. It seemed a daft decision at the time and looks no better with the benefit of hindsight as he allowed him to go for free. Hindmarch signed for Derby and became something of a cult hero as he captained them to two successive promotions into the top tier. He then signed for Wolves in 1990 and was appointed club captain but only spent one season at Molineux.\n\nIt is a poignant fact that the Sunderland team that took the field at Orient in 1978 contained three young men that would see their lives cut short. Both Rob Hindmarch and Mel Holden were diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease. Mel Holden died in January 1981 aged twenty-six years and Rob Hindmarch in November 2002 aged forty-one. Both left a wife and young children. Tim Gilbert too would pass far too young in May 1995 aged thirty-six of a heart attack. Three fine players to have graced our colours on this day at Brisbane Road.\n\nDivision Two Date – 14.01.1978 Venue – Brisbane Road Attendance – 6,737\n\nGoalscorers – Clarke 62 mins; Kitchen 73 mins; Rowell 74 mins; Chiedozie 75 mins\n\nOrient – Jackson; Fisher; Roffey; Bennett; Hoadley; Roeder; Chiedozie; Gray; D Clarke (Payne 60 mins); Kitchen; Grealish.

Tre White led all scorers with 19 points on 6-of-13 shooting with 10 rebounds (6 offensive) and 3 assists, while star freshman Darryn Peterson had 16 points.\n\nMelvin Council Jr. also had 15 points and 7 rebounds, along with the early wake-up call.\n\nBOOM pic.twitter.com/ylRHBk65fe\n\n— Kansas Men’s Basketball (@KUHoops) January 14, 2026\n\nKansas was up double digits midway through the fourth quarter and up by 21 at halftime. Iowa State made a push early in the second half, but the deficit never slipped below double-digits.\n\n\"I thought the intensity was great. I hoped we showed some toughness,\" Kansas coach Bill Self said. \"Other than that seven minutes to start the second half, we played great the whole time. We shared it, were aggressive, and our defense was above what it has been.\"\n\nThe Cyclones were cold across the floor on offense as well as mistake-prone, with leading scorer and All-America candidate Joshua Jefferson posting only 12 points on 4-of-14 shooting with 8 rebounds and 5 turnovers. Meanwhile, Kansas shot 50.8% from the field and 50% from 3-point range, with only 9 turnovers.\n\nIowa State going down narrows the list of undefeated men's Division I teams down to four: No. 1 Arizona, No. 8 Nebraska, No. 10 Vanderbilt and Miami (OH). The previously dominant Michigan received its first loss only two days earlier at home against Wisconsin.\n\nIt had been a rough go lately for Kansas, falling out of the AP Top 25 this week after losses to unranked UCF and West Virginia in its past three games. Had they lost Tuesday, it would have been their first 1-3 start in conference play since the 1987-88 season.\n\nInstead, Tuesday was a reminder they still have the talent to be dangerous.",

    "fullText": "With all of the talented 5A girls basketball teams in Utah, the Olympus Titans have quietly been making a move to be included among them.\n\nThe Titans took another big step Tuesday evening. Led by Kya Newton and Cammie Bontempo, Olympus stayed undefeated in Region 6 play with a 55-45 win over Alta on the Hawks’ home court in Sandy.\n\nNewton led with 23 points, and Bontempo had 11 points and a career-high 21 rebounds as the Titans used a 11-0 scoring burst in the second quarter to build a nice lead they never relinquished.\n\n“Cammie was a beast,” said Olympus coach Whitney Jenkins. “She and Kya were all over the court and they took over our offense when we needed it. We had some turnovers, but I was OK with it because we trying to set up our players for layups.”\n\nWith its ninth straight win, Olympus improved to 11-2 overall and 4-0 in region, and it sets up a potentially exciting home battle at 5:15 p.m. Friday against third-ranked Bountiful (also unbeaten in region).\n\nWith the Titans’ boys program being the defending state champ and slated to play host to the Redhawks immediately afterward, the Holladay school might be a busy place that day.\n\n“(Tuesday’s win) sets up a big game,” Jenkins said. “This is such a tough region, and we know the road (to the title) has to go through Bountiful. We knew it had to go through Alta, too. They are so tough and have so many seniors; we just made the plays when we had to.”\n\nBoth Olympus and Alta started slowly but the game initially moved in the Titans’ favor thanks to the hustle of Bontempo, a 5-foot-7 senior who had more rebounds (17) than the entire Alta team by halftime. The game was tied 12-12 early in the second quarter when Olympus earned its big lead, and Bontempo helped with several offensive boards that led to baskets during a four-minute span when the Hawks went scoreless.\n\nNewton, meanwhile, anchored the team’s offense. The 5-foot-4 senior is the Titans’ leading scorer at 20.8 points per game. She moved from the Mountain Ridge area last summer and played a big enough role on Olympus’ soccer team last fall to earn a scholarship to Utah State.\n\nOn this night, Newton made 7 of 16 shots (with a pair of 3-pointers) and added 7 of 10 free throws. She also asked to control the ball in the final minutes to help Olympus withstand Alta’s last rally.\n\nAlta didn’t go quietly. The Hawks, who came into the game in a three-way tie with Bountiful and Olympus, came back behind Alia Baldassano, who had 17 points, and Olivia Stephens, who added 12.\n\nAlta got to within eight points in the fourth quarter until running out of time. The Hawks (12-2, 3-1) will have a chance to stay close in the region race when they travel to Bountiful Jan. 20.",

However, as there was no buy option or obligation included by either side in the terms, the Cameroonian will return to Old Trafford once his temporary deal expires and negotiate his next steps.\n\nFrom his point of view, he hopes that he can continue in M16.\n\nOnana is tied to United until 2028, potentially even 2029, given the one-year option in his contract.\n\n(Photo by Stu Forster/Getty Images)\n\nAccording to the iPaper, sources close to the 29-year-old believe that ‘if a head coach comes in who favours goalkeepers playing the ball out with their feet – like Xavi – they may turn to the Trabzonspor loanee once more’.\n\nUltimately, you’d imagine Onana is only setting himself up for disappointment.\n\nUnited are beyond pleased with how Senne Lammens has adapted to the English top flight and established himself as a reliable shot-stopper, leaving no room for the likes of Onana, who’s accumulated a catalogue of costly errors, to swoop in and steal the spot.\n\nSources close to senior Man Utd loanee believe he wants to controversially revive his career under next Old Trafford boss in 26/27\n\n‘Closing in on deal’: Ornstein drops unexpected transfer update over Man Utd target with medical now scheduled\n\nMichael Carrick has already told former teammate which Man Utd player he wants to ‘build around’, fans will be delighted",

    "fullText": "In vision science, a saccade ( sə-KAHD; French: [sakad]; French for 'jerk') is a quick, simultaneous movement of both eyes between two or more phases of focal points in the same direction.[1] In contrast, in smooth-pursuit movements, the eyes move smoothly instead of in jumps.[2] Controlled cortically by the frontal eye fields (FEF), or subcortically by the superior colliculus, saccades serve as a mechanism for focal points, rapid eye movement, and the fast phase of optokinetic nystagmus.[1] The word appears to have been coined in the 1880s by the French ophthalmologist Émile Javal, who used a mirror on one side of a page to observe eye movement in silent reading and found that it involves a succession of discontinuous individual movements.[3] These movements quickly scan objects of attention and aid the brain in grasping a scene visually.[4]\n\nHumans and many organisms do not look at a scene in steadiness; instead, the eyes move around, locating interesting parts of the scene and building up a three-dimensional 'map' corresponding to the scene (as opposed to the graphical map of avians, which often relies upon detection of angular movement on the retina).[citation needed]\n\nWhen scanning immediate surroundings or reading, human eyes make saccadic movements and stop several times, moving very quickly between each stop. The speed of movement during each saccade cannot be controlled; the eyes move as fast as they are able.[5] One reason for the saccadic movement of the human eye is that the central part of the retina—known as the fovea—which provides the high-resolution portion of vision is very small in humans, only about 1–2 degrees of vision, but it plays a critical role in resolving objects.[6] Saccades allow the eyes to sense small parts of a scene with greater resolution and thereby allow the brain to assemble these parts into a coherent, continuous mental representation.[7]\n\nSaccades are one of the fastest movements produced by the human eye (blinks may reach even higher peak velocities). The peak angular speed of the eye during a saccade reaches up to 700°/s in humans for great saccades (25° of visual angle); in some monkeys, peak speed can reach 1000°/s.[8] Saccades to an unexpected stimulus normally take about 200 milliseconds (ms) to initiate, and then last from about 20–200 ms, depending on their amplitude (20–30 ms is typical in language reading). Under certain laboratory circumstances, the latency of, or reaction time to, saccade production can be cut nearly in half (express saccades). These saccades are generated by a neuronal mechanism that bypasses time-consuming circuits and activates the eye muscles more directly.[9][10] Specific pre-target oscillatory (alpha rhythms) and transient activities occurring in posterior-lateral parietal cortex and occipital cortex also characterize express saccades.[11]\n\nTo achieve such high speeds, there are specialized oculomotor burst neurons in the brainstem that wire into the ocular motor neuron. The burst neurons implement bang-bang control: they are either completely inhibited, or firing at its full rate of ~1000 Hz.[12] Since the motion of the eye is essentially a linear system, bang-bang control minimizes travel time.[13] After a saccade, a constant force is required to hold the position against elastic force, thus resulting in a pulse-step control.[14]\n\nThe amplitude of a saccade is the angular distance the eye travels during the movement. For amplitudes up to 15 or 20°, the velocity of a saccade linearly depends on the amplitude (the so-called saccadic main sequence,[15] a term borrowed from astrophysics; see Figure). For amplitudes larger than 20°, the peak velocity starts to plateau[15] (nonlinearly) toward the maximum velocity attainable by the eye at around 60°. For instance, a 10° amplitude is associated with a velocity of 300°/s, and 30° is associated with 500°/s.[16] Therefore, for larger amplitude ranges, the main sequence can best be modeled by an inverse power law function.[17]\n\nThe high peak velocities and the main sequence relationship can also be used to distinguish micro-/saccades from other eye movements (like ocular tremor, ocular drift, and smooth pursuit). Velocity-based algorithms are a common approach for saccade detection in eye tracking.[18][19][20] Although, depending on the demands on timing accuracy, acceleration-based methods are more precise.[21]\n\nSaccades may rotate the eyes in any direction to relocate gaze direction (the direction of sight that corresponds to the fovea), but normally saccades do not rotate the eyes torsionally. (Torsion is clockwise or counterclockwise rotation around the line of sight when the eye is at its central primary position; defined this way, Listing's law says that, when the head is motionless, torsion is kept at zero.)\n\nHead-fixed saccades can have amplitudes of up to 90° (from one edge of the oculomotor range to the other), but in normal conditions saccades are far smaller, and any shift of gaze larger than about 20° is accompanied by a head movement. During such gaze saccades, first, the eye produces a saccade to get gaze on target, whereas the head follows more slowly and the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) causes the eyes to roll back in the head to keep gaze on the target. Since the VOR can actually rotate the eyes around the line of sight, combined eye and head movements do not always obey Listing's law.[22]\n\nThe rotational inertia of the eye is negligible compared to the elastic and viscous force.\n\nSaccades can be categorized by intended goal in four ways:[23]\n\nAs referenced to above, it is also useful to categorize saccades by latency (time between go-signal and movement onset). In this case the categorization is binary: Either a given saccade is an express saccade or it is not. The latency cut-off is approximately ~200 ms; any longer than this is outside the express saccade range.[9][10]\n\nMicrosaccades are a related type of fixational eye movement that are small, jerk-like, involuntary eye movements, similar to miniature versions of voluntary saccades. They typically occur during visual fixation, not only in humans, but also in other animals with foveal vision, such as haplorhine primates in general and hawks.[24] Microsaccade amplitudes vary from 2 to 120 arcminutes.\n\nWhen exploring the visual environment with the gaze, humans make two to three fixations a second. Each fixation involves binocularly coordinated movements of the eyes to acquire the new target in three dimensions: horizontal and vertical, but also in-depth. In literature it has been shown how an upward or a vertical saccade is generally accompanied by a divergence of the eyes, while a downward saccade is accompanied by a convergence.[25] The amount of this intra-saccadic vergence has a strong functional significance for the effectiveness of binocular vision.[26] When making an upward saccade, the eyes diverged to be aligned with the most probable uncrossed disparity in that part of the visual field. On the other way around, when making a downward saccade, the eyes converged to enable alignment with crossed disparity in that part of the field. The phenomenon can be interpreted as an adaptation of rapid binocular eye movements to the statistics of the 3D environment, in order to minimize the need for corrective vergence movements at the end of saccades.\n\nSaccadic oscillations not fitting the normal function are a deviation from a healthy or normal condition. Nystagmus is characterized by the combination of 'slow phases', which usually take the eye off the point of regard, interspersed with saccade-like \"quick phases\" that serve to bring the eye back on target. Pathological slow phases may be due to either an imbalance in the vestibular system or damage to the brainstem \"neural integrator\" that normally holds the eyes in place.[citation needed] On the other hand, opsoclonus or ocular flutter are composed purely of fast-phase saccadic eye movements. Without the use of objective recording techniques, it may be very difficult to distinguish between these conditions.[medical citation needed]\n\nEye movement measurements are also used to investigate psychiatric disorders. For example, ADHD is characterized by an increase of antisaccade errors and an increase in delays for visually guided saccade.[23] Various pathological conditions also alter microsaccades and other fixational eye movements.[27][28]\n\nParoxysmal eye–head movements, termed aberrant gaze saccades, are an early symptom of GLUT1 deficiency syndrome in infancy.[29][non-primary source needed]\n\nWhen the brain is led to believe that the saccades it is generating are too large or too small (by an experimental manipulation in which a saccade-target steps backward or forward contingent on the eye movement made to acquire it), saccade amplitude gradually decreases (or increases), an adaptation (also termed gain adaptation) widely seen as a simple form of motor learning, possibly driven by an effort to correct visual error. This effect was first observed in humans with ocular muscle palsy.[30] In these cases, it was noticed that the patients would make hypometric (small) saccades with the affected eye, and that they were able to correct these errors over time. This led to the realization that visual or retinal error (the difference between the post-saccadic point of regard and the target position) played a role in the homeostatic regulation of saccade amplitude. Since then, much scientific research has been devoted to various experiments employing saccade adaptation.[31]\n\nSaccadic eye movement allows the mind to read quickly, but it comes with its disadvantages. It can cause the mind to skip over words because it does not see them as important to the sentence, and the mind completely leaves it from the sentence or it replaces it with the wrong word. This can be seen in \"Paris in the the Spring\". This is a common psychological test, where the mind will often skip the second \"the\", especially when there is a line break in between the two.\n\nWhen speaking, the mind plans what will be said before it is said. Sometimes the mind is not able to plan in advance and the speech is rushed out. This is why there are errors like mispronunciation, stuttering, and unplanned pauses. The same thing happens when reading. The mind does not always know what will come next. This is another reason that the second \"the\" can be missed.[32]\n\nIt is a common but false belief that during the saccade, no information is passed through the optic nerve to the brain. Whereas low spatial frequencies (the 'fuzzier' parts) are attenuated, higher spatial frequencies (an image's fine details) that would otherwise be blurred by the eye movement remain unaffected. This phenomenon, known as saccadic masking or saccadic suppression, is known to begin prior to saccadic eye movements in every primate species studied, implying neurological reasons for the effect rather than simply the image's motion blur.[33] This phenomenon leads to the so-called stopped-clock illusion, or chronostasis.\n\nA person may observe the saccadic masking effect by standing in front of a mirror and looking from one eye to the next (and vice versa). The subject will not experience any movement of the eyes or any evidence that the optic nerve has momentarily ceased transmitting. Through saccadic masking, the eye/brain system not only hides the eye movements from the individual but also hides the evidence that anything has been hidden. Of course, a second observer watching the experiment will see the subject's eyes moving back and forth. The function's main purpose is to prevent an otherwise significant smearing of the image.[16] (One can experience one’s eye saccade movements by using a cellphone's front-facing camera as a delayed mirror; if the screen is held a couple of inches away as the viewer looks from one eye to the other, the signal-processing delay allows them to see the end of their own saccade movement.)\n\nWhen a visual stimulus is seen before a saccade, subjects are still able to make another saccade back to that image, even if it is no longer visible. This shows that the brain is somehow able to take into account the intervening eye movement. It is thought that the brain does this by temporarily recording a copy of the command for the eye movement, and comparing this to the remembered image of the target. This is called spatial updating. Neurophysiologists, having recorded from cortical areas for saccades during spatial updating, have found that memory-related signals get remapped during each saccade.[34]\n\nIt is also thought that perceptual memory is updated during saccades so that information gathered across fixations can be compared and synthesized. However, the entire visual image is not updated during each saccade. Some scientists believe that this is the same as visual working memory, but as in spatial updating the eye movement has to be accounted for. The process of retaining information across a saccade is called trans-saccadic memory, and the process of integrating information from more than one fixation is called trans-saccadic integration.\n\nSaccades are a widespread phenomenon across animals with image-forming visual systems. They have been observed in animals across three phyla, including animals that do not have a fovea (most vertebrates do) and animals that cannot move their eyes independently of their head (such as insects).[35] Therefore, while saccades serve in humans and other primates to increase the effective visual resolution of a scene, there must be additional reasons for the behavior. The most frequently suggested of these reasons is to avoid blurring of the image, which would occur if the response time of a photoreceptor cell is longer than the time a given portion of the image is stimulating that photoreceptor as the image drifts across the eye.\n\nIn birds, saccadic eye movements serve a further function. The avian retina is highly developed. It is thicker than the mammalian retina, has a higher metabolic activity, and has less vasculature obstruction, for greater visual acuity.[36] Because of this, the retinal cells must obtain nutrients via diffusion through the choroid and from the vitreous humor.[37] The pecten is a specialised structure in the avian retina. It is a highly vascular structure that projects into the vitreous humor. Experiments show that, during saccadic eye oscillations (which occupy up to 12% of avian viewing time), the pecten oculi acts as an agitator, propelling perfusate (natural lubricants) toward the retina. Thus, in birds, saccadic eye movements appear to be important in retinal nutrition and cellular respiration.[38]",

    "description": "The company wants to plow more money into its wearable tech.",
    "fullText": "Meta is laying off more than 1,000 workers, signaling a partial retreat from the company’s much-derided metaverse ambitions.\n\nThe layoff, the Bay Area tech industry’s first big job cut of 2026, was announced Tuesday morning in an internal post from Meta’s chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth, according to a Bloomberg report that Meta spokesperson Tracy Clayton confirmed to SFGATE. The cuts won’t touch Facebook, Instagram or WhatsApp; they’re within Meta’s Reality Labs arm, an operation that’s poured investment into the “metaverse” idea and also sells the company’s virtual reality headsets and Ray-Ban glasses.\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\n“We said last month that we were shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward Wearables,” Clayton wrote in an emailed statement. “This is part of that effort, and we plan to reinvest the savings to support the growth of wearables this year.”\n\nAs of Tuesday at 9:15 a.m., the Menlo Park company had not filed a WARN document with California officials announcing the local scope of the layoffs.\n\nMeta’s pullback from its metaverse goals has been a long time coming. When Mark Zuckerberg changed his company’s name from Facebook in October 2021, he expounded on the idea of a virtual world where people could work, learn, play and shop together, calling it an “embodied internet where you’re in the experience, not just looking at it.”\n\nHe wrote, “Feeling truly present with another person is the ultimate dream of social technology.” His ambitions were, like the rhetoric, grand: “Our hope is that within the next decade, the metaverse will reach a billion people, host hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce, and support jobs for millions of creators and developers.”\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nBut hype around the idea of a metaverse — at one point, people were buying virtual land on other companies’ versions of the metaverse — quickly faded into derision. Meta was mocked for its legless virtual avatars, and failed to turn its Horizon Worlds metaverse product into a hit.\n\nRather than renewing the company, the ambition instead has served as a drag on Meta’s finances. In 2024, the company reported spending 21% of its costs on the Reality Labs segment, even as it lost more than $17.7 billion in the division. Quarter after quarter, the long-term bet has eaten into Meta’s vast social media ad profits. Bloomberg reported Tuesday that the division has turned a $71 billion loss since the start of 2021.\n\nZuckerberg’s choice to move that investment toward Meta’s wearables, rather than the metaverse, is a bet on products that Meta has been actually able to find large audiences for. The company’s Quest headsets are well-reviewed and far, far cheaper than Apple’s Vision Pro offering. Bloomberg reported that Meta is considering doubling its output of its new artificial intelligence-embedded glasses, thanks to high demand.\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nAs SFGATE reported, Zuckerberg is imagining a future where anyone not wearing high-tech frames will be at a “cognitive disadvantage.” Moving money from the metaverse toward wearables means he’s swapping one lofty ambition for another.\n\nWork at a Bay Area tech company and want to talk?

    "description": "Scheme intended to verify someone’s right to work in the UK will be optional, government admitted in 13th U-turn since taking power",
    "fullText": "Sir Keir Starmer has abandoned plans for mandatory digital IDs for workers in the 13th significant U-turn of his ­premiership.\n\nThe prime minister had previously announced that they would be ­compulsory to verify the right to work, as part of a crackdown on migration.\n\nGovernment sources said on Tuesday night that this would instead be optional when the IDs were introduced in 2029. Workers would be given the choice of using other ­documents to ­verify their identity.\n\nThere had been concern that making the IDs mandatory would undermine public trust in the scheme and lead to a cabinet revolt. Starmer wants to ­refocus the case for IDs on making it easier for people to use services such as registering births, deaths and marriages, bank accounts, voting and booking GP appointments­.\n\nShortly before Labour’s conference in September, Starmer had put migration at the heart of the rationale for IDs, saying: “We need to know who is in our country.” He said then the scheme would stop illegal migrants from being able to “slip into the shadow economy”.\n\nHe pledged to make ID cards “mandatory for the right to work before the end of this Parliament”. “We need to know who is in our country,” he said, adding that digital IDs would prevent migrants from being able to come to the UK illegally and being able to “slip into the shadow economy”.\n\nBefore he announced his plans for digital IDs, nearly six in ten voters backed them, with one in four opposed, according to YouGov. Afterwards that dropped to just under four in ten in ­favour, with nearly half opposed.\n\nThere are mounting concerns about the cost and complexity of the scheme. The Office for Budget Responsibility has said it could cost as much as £1.8 billion over the next three years. The government has disputed that but refused to provide a figure of its own.\n\nA government source said: “Stepping back from mandatory use cases will ­deflate one of the main points of ­contention. We do not want to risk there being cases of some 65-year-old in a rural area being barred from ­working because he hasn’t downloaded this app.”\n\nAnother government source said that it had never been wise to try to sell the plan on right-to-work checks. “That does not impact normal people,” they said. “It always should have been about the convenience.”\n\nUnder the plans, anyone starting a job would have been required to “show” the digital ID, which would be checked against a central database of those ­entitled to work in the UK. While right-to-work checks will still be mandatory, they can now take place using other forms of documentation such as an electronic visa or passport. A consultation will explore what other checks could be used.\n\nA government spokesman said: “We ­remain committed to mandatory digital right-to-work checks. Currently [such] checks ­include a hodgepodge of paper-based systems with no record of checks ever taking place. This is open to fraud and abuse. We have always been clear that details on the digital ID scheme will be set out following a full public consultation which will launch shortly. Digital ID will make everyday life easier for people, ensuring public services are more personal, joined-up and effective, while also remaining inclusive.”\n\nGovernment sources also said that the changes would combat conspiracy theorists who say digital IDs are about state control of people’s lives.\n\nDarren Jones, the chief secretary to the prime minister who is responsible for the digital ID introduction, said: “I’m confident that this time next year, polling will be in a much better place on Digital ID than it is today.”\n\nLast week Starmer made Josh Simons, the MP and ex-head of the ­Labour Together think tank, the science and technology minister in charge of the scheme, ­reporting to Jones.\n\nStarmer has suffered cabinet criticism of the scheme amid fears that it would drive left-wing Labour voters to the Liberal Democrats and Greens. Ministers told The Times in October that the scheme was a “fantasy” that would do nothing to address the problem of illegal immigration. Another said it was “too expensive and complicated” and would end up recreating “what already exists, which is e-visas for migrants”.\n\nThe reversal follows 12 others from Labour. The party has backtracked on higher business rates for pubs; relaxed the inheritance tax raid on farmers; dropped plans for day-one protection from unfair dismissal; scrapped the two-child benefit cap; shelved plans to raise the main rate of income tax; dropped welfare reforms; agreed to a national inquiry­ on grooming gangs; increased national insurance; reinstated winter fuel payments for millions; dropped the claim that trans women are women; ­watered down plans to limit academy freedoms; and dropped a pledge to act on women who have lost pension cash.\n\nMike Wood, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, said: “While we welcome the scrapping of any mandatory identification, this is yet another humiliating U-turn from the government. Keir Starmer’s spinelessness is becoming a pattern, not an exception. What was sold as a tough measure to tackle illegal working is now set to become yet another costly, ill-thought-out experiment abandoned at the first sign of pressure from Labour’s back benches.”\n\nThe Liberal Democrats said: “No 10 must be bulk-ordering motion sickness tablets … to cope with all their U-turns.”",

    "description": "When Dylan Rothenberg moved to China, it felt like the Wild West: \"Everything felt negotiable — anything was possible if you were ambitious enough.\"",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Dylan Rothenberg, 32, the founder of Wu Mountain Tea. His words have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI realized in high school that my academic strength was learning foreign languages.\n\nMy dad did business in China, and his best friend was Chinese, so I've always had a connection to the country.\n\nWhen I was 15, I went to China to stay with a host family for six months as part of a US government-sponsored full-immersion program. It was in 2009, the golden era of US-China relations.\n\nAt 19, I decided to major in Chinese and economics at the University of Colorado, Boulder.\n\nI spent my junior year abroad in Beijing at Peking University. After six months, I started working as a translator.\n\nI sat in on negotiations with company founders, one of whom ran a tea company. He tasked me with buying tea and shipping it out to Geneva.\n\nI decided to take a temporary leave from school and moved to Guangzhou, home to the world's largest tea market.\n\nChina felt like the Wild West. At the time, nothing was black and white. Everything felt negotiable — anything was possible if you were ambitious enough.\n\nIn the market, I was haggling for goods and negotiating. It was pure adrenaline. I'd see the address of a manufacturer on the back of a packet of tea in the convenience store, then head to that address and start talking to the factory owner.\n\nWhen I was in a factory waiting for tea bags to be produced, a guy invited me to meet his professor, who specialized in tea at the South China Agricultural University. The professor told me to come back to Guangzhou after I graduated, and he'd teach me everything he knew about tea. He told me I'd be his first American tea graduate.\n\nI felt he was offering me a chance to be exceptional at one thing. After talking to my parents, I decided I wanted to focus on tea as a career after completing my bachelor's.\n\nI founded my company, Wu Mountain Tea, in 2015. Two years later, I started my master's degree in tea science and went on to earn a Ph.D. — both completed in China.\n\nHere, I've been able to form deeper personal connections. My best friends are Chinese, and I have close ties with lab colleagues and my gym bros.\n\nOne of my friends grew up in Wushan, the area of Guangzhou where I live, which means \"five mountains.\" I call him my \"sixth mountain.\"\n\nI see my professors two or three times a week. The relationship with teachers here is much closer than in the US. We drink together, have dinner at their homes, and discuss research in real time.\n\nI'll miss China's high-speed rail. It connects cities the size of New York or Chicago with metro-like efficiency. I travel often.\n\nGuangzhou to Shanghai — a distance of 1,500 kilometers, or 930 miles — takes seven hours, and I can arrive 20 minutes before departure and just scan my passport. Then I'm whipping along at 250 kilometers an hour. In the US, traveling equivalent distances is a logistical issue.\n\nThe shrimp dumpling, xiajiao, is my favorite morsel on earth. I can get a serving of roast duck in my campus dining hall for just 6 yuan, around 85 cents, and it's better than any duck dish in New York City's Chinatown.\n\nThe biggest struggle here is that strangers stare at me and point at me. I'm like an alien walking around. Even if they're not saying anything malicious about me, it's upsetting.\n\nIn New York State, where I'm from, you can't really make eye contact like that. It provokes confrontation. And here, I can't just lose my cool when someone is staring or laughing at me. For the last three years, I haven't left the house without a low-brimmed hat.\n\nAt the same time, I know I'm doing something unique. My YouTube channel, dedicated to tea, has more than 50,000 subscribers. If my business continues to grow, I could see myself staying in China — but for now, my plan is to return to the US.\n\nI grew up in Syracuse, the snowiest city in the US. I skied 120 days a year and was an alpine ski racer at a competitive level. I'm more comfortable on skis than on my own two feet.\n\nIn Guangzhou, there's no snow at all. I've been far away from what I love the most for the last 10 years. I plan to move back to Salt Lake City in a couple of years, so I can be closer to the mountains and my family.\n\nDo you have a story about living in Asia that you want to share?

    "description": "The Fed Chair sent a letter to the Senate Banking Committee in July that extensively responded to their inquiries on the Fed building renovation.",
    "fullText": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell sent a letter dated July 14, 2025, to key senators on the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, following his testimony before Congress about renovations to the central bank buildings.\n\nIn it, the Fed chair gave lawmakers a detailed and expansive response to inquiries about the renovations.\n\nPowell's letter to the Senate Banking Committee, obtained by Business Insider, was sent 10 days before giving President Donald Trump and other White House officials a tour of the renovation site on July 24, 2025.\n\nPowell announced via video message on January 11 that the Department of Justice served grand jury subpoenas to the Federal Reserve. He said the probe is into his June testimony about renovations at historic Fed office buildings, but warned that it was a pressure tactic over interest rates.\n\n\"This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions — or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.\"\n\nRep. Anna Paulina Luna accused Powell of misleading Congress and sent a criminal referral to the Justice Department, though it's unclear whether that prompted the DOJ investigation.\n\nThe letter to Sen. Tim Scott, chairman of the committee, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the ranking member, outlines the history of the Fed's Washington, DC, buildings, offers details about the repairs and working conditions, and provides information about the cost of the project's budget.\n\nThe letter was first reported by the Financial Times.\n\nPowell wrote that the Federal Reserve Board \"believes it is of the utmost importance to provide transparency for our decisions and to be accountable to the public through the Congress for our work.\"\n\nDuring Powell's testimony in June, Scott said the Fed's more than $2 billion renovation of its headquarters was excessive and likened it to the \"Palace of Versailles.\" Powell responded that many features Scott mentioned no longer exist, such as beehives, a VIP elevator, and water features, but added that the Marriner S. Eccles Building urgently needed safety upgrades and hadn't been meaningfully renovated before work began in 2022.\n\nThe White House and the Federal Reserve Board did not immediately respond to a request for comments.",

    "description": "The Andreessen Horowitz cofounder explained how the venture capital firm maintains a lean operation despite being a large firm.",
    "fullText": "Ben Horowitz is a big fan of tiny teams.\n\nOn an episode of the A16z podcast, the Andreessen Horowitz cofounder shared how his venture capital firm maintains a lean operation despite being one of the world's largest.\n\n\"An investing team shouldn't be too much bigger than a basketball team,\" he said, referring to advice he got from famed American investor David Swensen in 2009.\n\nHe added, \"A basketball team is five people who start, and the reason for that is the conversation around the investments really needs to be a conversation.\"\n\nHorowitz cofounded the Silicon Valley VC firm with Marc Andreessen in 2009. Before A16Z, he ran enterprise software company Opsware, which Hewlett-Packard acquired.\n\nA16z has backed marquee companies including Meta, Airbnb, GitHub, and Coinbase.\n\nThe VC said he always kept the basketball team size in mind but also knew that the firm had to expand to keep up with how \"software was eating the world,\" his signature phrase. The solution was to split the firm into different investment verticals.\n\nTo maintain good communication, staff attend other teams' meetings when investment themes overlap.\n\nThe firm also organizes a two to three-day offsite twice a year, \"with not much agenda.\"\n\nHorowitz said that people who join them from other firms say that A16Z has \"less politics\" than firms with 10 or 11 people because his firm has a culture where politicking is \"disincentivized.\"\n\nA16z might have been early to the tiny team trend, but it's catching on fast with VCs and startups across the world.\n\nStartups are actively seeking to stay small, with many having fewer than 10 people. Founders told Business Insider that AI and vibe coding tools have boosted their productivity, allowing them to get things done with far fewer people. Less politics and bureaucracy are also big pluses, they say.\n\n\"We're going to see 10-person companies with billion-dollar valuations pretty soon,\" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in February 2024. \"In my little group chat with my tech CEO friends, there's this betting pool for the first year there is a one-person billion-dollar company, which would've been unimaginable without AI. And now will happen.\"",

    "description": "Ukraine's air command for the central region published video of the Tempest firing what appear to be Hellfire Longbow missiles into the night sky.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's air defense forces said they've destroyed at least 21 Russian Shaheds with a new American light vehicle that fires guided missiles from its back.\n\nThe vehicle, called the Tempest, featured in a video posted on Tuesday by Ukraine's Air Command for the country's central region.\n\nThe footage showed at least three video clips of the system firing into the night sky, its missile arcing upward to track its target.\n\n\"As of now, our crew has destroyed 21 Shahed drones,\" said a Ukrainian soldier, identified by Air Command Central as an operator with the call-sign \"Shorty,\" in the video.\n\nThe four-wheeled, off-road buggy is equipped with a dual launcher that appears to be fitted with missiles that look like the AGM-114 Hellfire.\n\nThese American-made missiles typically require the assistance of a laser to track their targets and are often fired from aircraft such as the MQ-9 Reaper and the AH-64 Apache.\n\nThe Tempest, however, likely uses the Longbow variant, which instead uses radar to home in on targets in a fire-and-forget fashion. The Hellfire Longbow carries a 9-kilogram, or 20-pound, warhead.\n\nThe Ukrainian video did not specifically identify the type of missile used. The company that built the Tempest, V2X, is a Virginia-headquartered firm that's also pitching the vehicle to the US Army.\n\n\"This machine keeps the sky locked down,\" Shorty said in the air command video.\n\nHe added that his crew was previously deployed to Ukraine's eastern regions, saying that they destroyed \"all targets\" they attacked there.\n\nOther clips of the Tempest in action showed the buggy maneuvering in open fields, muddy terrain, and on a road.\n\nMobility is a key need for Ukraine's fight against Russian Shahed drones. Because these loitering munitions fly at speeds exceeding 100 mph, air defense crews only have a short time after detecting a target to arrive at an ideal firing location and launch.\n\nUkrainian troops once relied on trucks mounted with machine guns, but had to scramble for other options as Russia significantly increased the number of drones launched and started adapting to fly Shaheds at higher altitudes.\n\nThe sheer quantity of Shaheds that Ukraine often faces means that it needs lower-cost munitions to take them down.\n\nA congressional report from 2021 said that from 1998 to that year, the US spent roughly $10.9 billion, adjusted for inflation, on buying about 87,500 Hellfire missiles. That's about $123,000 per missile, though that figure would also include costs such as training, launchers, software, and support equipment.\n\nPrices can also vary for different variants of the missile, and the Longbow's radar guidance likely results in it being on the more expensive side.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian officials estimate that Russia can produce older Shaheds at roughly $35,000 each, though Moscow was believed to likely be making them at $70,000 apiece in 2025.\n\nIt's unclear what the cost ratio is between a Tempest launch and a Shahed or Gerbera, which are decoy drones that Russia deploys to give Ukrainians more targets to attack.\n\nWhen debuting the Tempest to the US Army in October 2025, V2X said the vehicle is made with commercial off-the-shelf components and can be offered as a stationary, trailer-mounted launcher.\n\nIt's also unclear how many Tempests are deployed in Ukraine. Only one vehicle appears onscreen at a time, and Ukraine is known to openly invite foreign weapons companies to test their products on the battlefield.\n\nNotably, the same clips of the Tempest firing, cropped to conceal the vehicle, appeared in an earlier New Year's montage published by Air Command Central, indicating that the vehicle has been in Ukraine since December.\n\nUkraine has increasingly relied on small first-person-view drones that are tweaked to fly extremely quickly and serve as interceptors. While these can cost as little as $2,000 each, they typically also require a human pilot and crew to successfully track, chase, and destroy a Shahed drone.",

    "fullText": "PHOENIX (AP) — Mark Brnovich, Arizona's top law enforcement officer when the state became the epicenter of efforts by President Donald Trump and his allies to find proof that the 2020 election was marred by fraud, has died. He was 59.\n\nBrnovich died after having a heart attack Monday, Katie Conner, a representative of the family, said Tuesday.\n\nColleagues and friends of Brnovich praised him for his work in public service that included stints as a judge, a prosecutor, lawyer and the director of the Arizona Department of Gaming. Former Republican Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey said Brnovich's passion for the law, justice and victims were hallmarks of his career.\n\n“For those of us blessed to call him a friend, his humor, positivity, and happy warrior spirit were infectious. May he rest in peace,” Ducey said on the social platform X.\n\nBrnovich, a Republican, was in his second term as attorney general in Arizona when his office investigated the 2020 election. Arizona was among the states Joe Biden won that year to deny Trump reelection to the presidency.\n\nBrnovich released an interim report in April 2022 that outlined his concerns with some election procedures but did not provide any proof of major issues despite six months of investigation.\n\nAt the time, Brnovich was seeking the Republican nomination for a U.S. Senate seat and facing fierce criticism from Trump, who claimed he wasn’t doing enough to prosecute election fraud. Brnovich wanted an endorsement from Trump but didn't get it.\n\nWhen current Attorney General Kris Mayes took office, she revealed that Brnovich suppressed findings from his investigators. Mayes said the records showed the 2020 election “was conducted fairly and accurately by election officials.”\n\nThe documents she released also showed Brnovich withheld a separate memo that systematically refuted election conspiracies that took root on the right, including allegations of dead or duplicate voters, pre-marked ballots flown in from Asia, election servers connected to the internet and even manipulation by satellites controlled by the Italian military.\n\nMayes posted on X that she was saddened to hear of Brnovich's sudden passing and said he dedicated many years to public service. She offered condolences to his wife Susan and their family.\n\nBrnovich lost the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate in 2021. In a video launching his campaign, Brnovich described himself as the son of immigrants who fled communism in Yugoslavia. He said he used his post as attorney general to take on “crony capitalists” and government overreach, while promoting religious liberty, border security and election integrity.\n\nIn April, Trump nominated Brnovich to be ambassador to Serbia but withdrew his nomination in October.",

    "title": "'Death by a thousand cuts': James Webb Space Telescope figures out how black hole murdered Pablo's Galaxy",
    "description": "\"It points to a slow starvation rather than a single dramatic death blow.\"",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nAstronomers have discovered that a young galaxy was gradually starved by its central supermassive black hole, in what was effectively a cosmic \"death by a thousand cuts.\"\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) studied this unfortunate galaxy, known as GS-10578 or by the slightly snappier nickname \"Pablo's Galaxy\" in honor of the first astronomer to study it in detail. The light from Pablo's Galaxy has taken around 11 billion years to reach us, meaning the JWST and ALMA allow astronomers to see it as it was just 3 billion years after the Big Bang. For such an early galaxy, it is exceptionally massive, containing as much mass as around 200 billion suns.\n\nThe majority of the stars in Pablo's Galaxy seem to have formed between 12.5 billion and 11.5 billion years ago. However, this galaxy seems to have stopped forming stars and has exhausted its supply of star-forming cold gas despite its relatively young age. As astronomers define the cessation of star formation and the transition into quiescence as the \"death\" of a galaxy, that means Pablo's Galaxy \"lived fast and died young.\"\n\nThe team behind this study first released results concerning Pablo's Galaxy back in Sept. 2024, using the JWST alone, finding that the supermassive black hole at its heart is pushing away huge amounts of gas at speeds as great as 2.2 million miles per hour (3.5 million km/h). That's fast enough to allow this star-forming matter to escape the gravitational influence of Pablo's Galaxy entirely.\n\nAdding ALMA, an array of 66 radio telescopes located in the Atacama Desert region of northern Chile, the researchers observed Pablo's Galaxy for a further seven hours searching for carbon monoxide, which they could use as a way to trace cold hydrogen gas, the stuff that forms stars. However, this search turned up empty-handed.\n\nBut this in itself was telling.\n\n\"What surprised us was how much you can learn by not seeing something,\" team member Jan Scholtz from Cambridge University in the UK said in a statement. \"Even with one of ALMA's deepest observations of this kind of galaxy, there was essentially no cold gas left. It points to a slow starvation rather than a single dramatic death blow.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a further 6.5 hours of observations with the JWST revealed that Pablo's Galaxy is losing about 60 suns' worth of mass in gas each year. At that rate, the galaxy's fuel for star formation could have been exhausted in a timescale of between 16 million and 220 million years. If that seems like an incredibly long period of time, consider that scientists normally estimate that it takes as long as a billion years to exhaust their fuel for star-formation in a galaxy such as this.\n\n\"The galaxy looks like a calm, rotating disc,\" team co-leader Francesco D'Eugenio of the Kavli Institute for Cosmology said. \"That tells us it didn't suffer a major, disruptive merger with another galaxy. Yet it stopped forming stars 400 million years ago, while the black hole is yet again active.\n\nThe team reconstructed the star formation history of Pablo's Galaxy, finding that fresh gas has been prevented by the black hole pushing gas outward from falling back into the galaxy. This prevents allowing the \"fuel tanks\" for star birth from being refilled. They also discovered that the supermassive black hole in this young galaxy didn't push away all of its gas at once, but has been experiencing repeated cycles of gas expulsion.\n\n\"So the current black hole activity and the outburst of gas we observed didn't cause the shutdown; instead, repeated episodes likely kept the fuel from coming back,\" D'Eugenio added.\n\nThe team's findings could help to explain why the JWST has been discovering lots of old-looking galaxies in the early universe.\n\n\"You don't need a single cataclysm to stop a galaxy forming stars, just keep the fresh fuel from coming in. Before Webb, these were unheard of,\" Scholtz said. \"Now we know they're more common than we thought — and this starvation effect may be why they live fast and die young.\"\n\nWith the effectiveness of the ALMA/JWST telescope tag-team established, astronomers hope that further observations of Pablo's Galaxy can reveal more about the mechanism used by the supermassive black hole to prematurely starve this galaxy to death.\n\nThe team's research was published on Tuesday (Nov. 25) in the journal Nature Astronomy.",

    "fullText": "Myrtle Beach drivers could soon see a change in the busy tourist district as City Council moves to end downtown flushing.\n\nAmid a flurry of legislative initiatives on Tuesday’s agenda for Myrtle Beach City Council’s first meeting of the year, a new motion would direct city manager Jonathan “Fox” Simons Jr. to end the Summer Emergency Vehicle Access Plan, or SEVAP, more commonly called flushing.\n\nThe plan – which city police said was intended to improve response times, increase visibility and allow officers to address concerns – seasonally reroutes part of the northbound lane Ocean Boulevard on weekend nights.\n\nIncoming Mayor Mark Kruea said the traffic diversion “visually sends the wrong message,” contributes to declining tourism and hurts local businesses.\n\n“The merchants reported a 40% decline in their revenues last year. If you’re trying to kill tourism, that’s the way to do it. We need to not take that action,” said Kruea.\n\nAlthough the motion would end scheduled flushing, it would still allow staff to utilize traffic control practices.\n\n“Police still have the ability to divert traffic as needed, but the automatic shut the boulevard down at 4:00 on Friday and Saturday serves no good purpose,” Kruea said.\n\nDespite support from businesses and the mayor, the motion isn’t without controversy. Councilman Mike Lowder shared support for SEVAP on behalf of consituents.\n\n“It is amazing how many residents, non-business owners, that I heard from,” said Lowder, “their displeasure, when they go down to the boulevard, they have to be turned off of the boulevard every Friday and Saturday night.”\n\nThe motion directs the manager to end SEVAP “effective immediately,” but a consultant is still finalizing an assessment of the plan. According to the motion language, a draft of the report will be ready in February.",

    "fullText": "CBS Evening News anchor Tony Dokoupil landed an interview with Donald Trump on Tuesday, and one of the unusual moments came when the president talked of what would have happened if Kamala Harris had won the 2024 election.\n\nThe president was claiming Harris would have continued what he called a “mess” of an economy under Joe Biden.\n\nTony Dokoupil’s First Week As ‘CBS Evening News’ Anchor Down Year Over Year; ‘World News Tonight’ Tops Viewers, ‘Nightly News’ Wins 25-54 Demo\n\nTrump Celebrity Supporters: Famous Folks In Favor Of The 47th President\n\nNew 'CBS Evening News' Anchor Tony Dokoupil To Interview Donald Trump\n\n“You wouldn’t have a job right now, if she got in. You probably wouldn’t have a job right now,” Trump told Dokoupil during the interview, conducted on the floor of a Ford plant in Detroit.\n\nWatch the full interview below.\n\nThen the president appeared to refer to David Ellison, who became CEO of Paramount last year after his Skydance bought the CBS parent company. Ellison’s father, Larry, is a longtime supporter of the president’s.\n\n“Your boss is an amazing guy,” Trump said. “Might be bust. Okay. Might be bust. I doubt it in his case, but you never know. Let me just tell you, you wouldn’t have this job. You wouldn’t have this job, certainly, whatever the hell they are paying you.”\n\nDokoupil later said that “I do think I’d have this job even if the other guy won.”\n\n“Yeah, but at a lesser salary,” Trump responded.\n\nThe Evening News ran the entirety of the interview, Dokoupil said, and it lasted about 15 minutes.\n\nDuring the conversation Trump talked about taking “very strong action” against Iran if the regime hangs protesters amid the unrest that has spread throughout the country. The president, though, was not specific about what that meant. At other points, Dokoupil let some of Trump’s claims go unchallenged, including that he “ended eight wars.” That has been challenged as hyperbole from the AP and other fact-checking sites.\n\nTrump also claimed that “there’s no inflation,” and later said that he had them “down to a level that they haven’t seen in about nine years.” In fact, consumer prices rose about 2.7% in December, according to the Department of Labor, and inflation was below 2% during points of Trump’s first term. The CBS Evening News anchor noted that “when I travel the country and I go all over the place and I talk to everyday Americans, they tell me they don’t feel it.”\n\n“I’ve only been here for 11 months, okay,” Trump responded, before saying that he “inherited a mess” and that “we have now the hottest country in the world.”\n\nThe most revelatory part of the interview may have been when Dokoupil questioned Trump about the shooting death of Renee Good by an ICE agent last week.\n\nDokoupil noted that he spoke to Good’s father, who is “a big supporter of yours.”\n\n“He’s heartbroken because his daughter is dead. He’s also heartbroken because your administration so quickly has come out and said she’s a domestic terrorist. What do you want to say to her father right now?”\n\nTrump answered, “Well, I want to say to the father that I love all of our people. They can be on the other side, as you say. He might be on my side.”\n\nDokoupil said, “He’s on your side.”\n\nTrump replied, “And I think that’s great … and I would bet you that she under normal circumstances was a very solid, wonderful person, but pretty tough.” He then went on to defend ICE and blast Joe Biden, before going back to the video of Good’s killing, and acknowledging that the videos are open to interpretation. Soon after the killing, the Department of Homeland Security quickly said that Good was trying to strike the ICE officer with her vehicle.\n\n“When you look at that tape, it can be viewed two ways, I guess,” Trump said. “But when you look at the way that was, that car was pulled away. There are a couple of versions of that tape that are very, very bad.”\n\n2026 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Streaming & Cable\n\nThe Movies That Have Made More Than $1 Billion At The Global Box Office\n\nThe 25 Highest-Grossing Animated Films Of All Time At The Global Box Office",

    "fullText": "“Bodybagz” is getting the biggest opportunity of his career in “Rain City.”\n\nUltimate Fighting Championship (UFC) CEO Dana White announced today that former Middleweight champion Israel Adesanya will headline UFC Seattle against surging contender Joe Pyfer on Sat., March 28, 2026, inside Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle, Washington.\n\nFor Adesanya (24-5), the bout represents a pivotal moment in his legendary career. The former champion is currently riding the longest losing streak of his time in the Octagon. In his most recent appearance, “The Last Stylebender” was knocked out by Nassourdine Imavov in the main event of UFC Saudi Arabia (watch highlights). Before that, he lost his title to Sean Strickland at UFC 293 and was later submitted by Dricus du Plessis at UFC 305 (watch highlights).\n\nDespite the recent skid, Adesanya remains one of the UFC’s most reliable headliners. UFC Seattle will mark his 12th consecutive main event appearance, and he currently sits at No. 6 in the Middleweight rankings.\n\nAcross the cage will be Pyfer (15-3), who finally gets his long-awaited step into elite company. After suffering his first UFC loss against Jack Hermansson in his first UFC main event, the Philadelphia knockout artist has rebounded in emphatic fashion.\n\nPyfer rattled off three straight victories, starting with a brutal knockout of Marc-Andre Barriault at UFC 303 (watch highlights), followed by a decision win over Kelvin Gastelum at UFC 316. Most recently, he showcased his evolving skill set by submitting Abus Magomedov at UFC 320 (watch highlights).\n\nA win over Adesanya would instantly vault Pyfer into the Middleweight Top 10.\n\nHere is what UFC Seattle currently looks like:\n\nCasey O’Neill vs. Gabriella Fernandes\n\nMarcin Tybura vs. Valter Walker\n\nNicolle Caliari vs. Carol Fiori\n\nMansur Abdul-Malik vs. Yousri Belgaroui",

    "description": "While the end of an era will hit hard for Ravens and Steelers fans who grew up with stability, the new-look Seahawks should be a beacon of hope.",
    "fullText": "John Harbaugh spent 18 years as head coach of the Baltimore Ravens. Mike Tomlin spent 19 years as head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Pete Carroll spent 19 total years as an NFL head coach, including 14 with the Seattle Seahawks. All three delivered a Super Bowl to their teams and cities during their long-tenured runs. But time ran out for all three as 2026 kicked off.\n\nHarbaugh, Tomlin and Carroll parted ways with their organizations within the first two weeks of the new year. Harbaugh and the Ravens \"mutually parted ways,\" Tomlin \"stepped down\" with the Steelers, while Carroll was outright fired by the Raiders. Carroll is likely headed to retirement, Tomlin is leaving football for at least a year, and while Harbaugh might get another job for next season, these three represent the old-style of football: culture over scheme, players over plays, and \"Jimmy's and Joe's over X's and O's.\"\n\nHarbaugh won his ring with the remnants of the early 2000 Ravens team, including Ray Lewis in his final year, with a big play-offense and an old-school defense. Carroll won the next year with an all-time great roster, but didn’t change the game with any innovative schemes. Five years earlier, it was Tomlin, winning with what was largely Bill Cowher's early 2000's Steelers team the distance with his own big-play offense and old-school defense. These coaches all stuck around for a decade or more after the fact. But perhaps that prevented their teams from evolving.\n\nOnce the Seahawks moved on from Carroll, they got to try a future with Mike Macdonald. Now they’re in as great shape as can be again. The Steelers and Ravens still have outdated strategies, and only keep competing for the playoffs because they’re in a division with the Cleveland Browns and Cincinnati Bengals who struggle as much as anyone to get, let alone, keep their act together.\n\nWhile the end of an era might hit hard for Ravens and Steelers fans who grew up with their identities of stability, they can look to the Seahawks as a beacon of hope. Seattle is showing them right now why moving into the next era of the NFL is better than staying in the past.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Seahawks Wire: NFL outgrew Seahawks' Carroll, Steelers' Tomlin, Ravens' Harbaugh eras",

    "fullText": "The NFL world was stunned on Tuesday morning when the news came out that Mike Tomlin was voluntarily stepping away as the head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers. This came less than 24 hours after the Steelers were blown out by the Houston Texans in the playoffs, marking the team's seventh-straight playoff loss.\n\nNow that we know the big news, let's talk about what might happen next.\n\nThere was a thought that Rodgers might run it back with the Steelers in 2026 but without Tomlin there, it's highly unlikely unless the Steelers bring in a coach with ties to Rodgers from Green Bay. So in other words, 2026 will be yet another new starting quarterback to kick off the season.\n\nWould anyone be shocked if the Steelers simply promoted offensive coordinator Arthur Smith to the head coach's position, let Teryl Austin leave and let Smith hire new coordinators? We hope this doesn't happen but it feels like a Steelers type of move.\n\nWe doubt Tomlin even considers coaching this season and fully expect him to find himself to a television studio for next season. This is great for the drama of seeing Tomlin coaching another team and the obvious comparisons that it would draw.\n\nWhen it was assumed that Tomlin was coming back, we fully believed there would be little to no changes to the roster. Now, with a new head coach coming in, all bets are off, especially at quarterback.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Steelers Wire: 4 things the Mike Tomlin news could mean for the Steelers",

    "fullText": "Yankees trade four highly touted prospects to Marlins for starter not named Sandy Alcantara originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New York Yankees have been exploring the market, both in free agency and on the trade block, for a new starting pitcher.\n\nThey lost out on Edward Cabrera to the Chicago Cubs, but they weren't done discussing trades just yet. In fact, they weren't done talking with the Miami Marlins for a trade either.\n\nAccording to Craig Mish of SportsGrid, the Yankees are sending four prospects to the Marlins for one starting pitcher. But that Marlins starter is not Sandy Alcantara, it's lefty Ryan Weathers.\n\n\"Miami Marlins are trading SP Ryan Weathers to the New York Yankees,\" Mish reports. \"Miami gets a big haul in return. 4 players in total. OF Dillon Lewis, OF Brendan Jones, IF Dillon Jasso, and IF Juan Matheus.\"\n\nWeathers is a left-handed pitcher who has appeared in 24 games as a starter over the last two seasons in Miami.\n\nThis past season, in eight starts, he had a 3.99 ERA with a 2-2 record and 37 strikeouts in 38.1 innings pitched. In 2024, Weathers posted a 3.63 ERA in 16 starts with a 5-6 record and 80 strikeouts in 86.2 innings pitched.\n\nAdding Weathers to the rotation options is a nice pickup, as the 26-year-old is not just an option for 2026, but will be around through the 2028 season as well.\n\nMore: Yankees get $160 million contract update on Cody Bellinger amid stare-down\n\nBut the cost to land Weathers was far from cheap. According to MLB Pipeline, Jones is ranked 15th, Lewis is ranked 16th, Jasso is ranked 23rd, and Matheus is unranked.\n\nSending three top-30 prospects for any players is a noteworthy haul, and for this Yankees-Marlins deal, the return, including Jones and Lewis, is significant.\n\nLewis is 22 years old and was one of the prospects in trade talks between the Marlins and Yankees over Cabrera recently. Now, he's part of the package for Weathers.\n\nOverall, the Yankees are sending four prospects, including three inside the Yankees' top 25, all for Weathers, a 26-year-old lefty starter who's never started more than 16 games in a season before.\n\nMets know what contract they need to give to sign Cody Bellinger\n\nPhillies get bad news on Bo Bichette amid unexpected challenge from Alex Bregman Cubs deal\n\nMLB Hot Stove tracker: Live updates on news, rumors, signings and trades for 2025 free agency\n\nRed Sox linked to frustrating Alex Bregman replacements after Cubs deal\n\nDodgers predicted to poach $189M Silver Slugger, All-Star from Phillies to solve aging dilemma\n\nMets get Kyle Tucker news in free agency\n\nTeam USA World Baseball Classic roster: Bryce Harper, Tarik Skubal among stars on team for 2026 tournament",

After avenging a loss to Alex Pereira by delivering a vicious knockout in their rematch, Adesanya dropped his title in a surprising decision to Sean Strickland.\n\nHe was then granted an immediate title shot against Dricus du Plessis, who beat Strickland for the belt, but he fell by fourth-round submission in that matchup. Adesanya then suffered his third loss in a row when he was knocked out Nassourdine Imavov back in February 2025.\n\nNow he’ll attempt to get back on track against Pyfer, who enters the fight off three straight wins over Marc-Andre Barriault, Kelvin Gastelum and Abus Magomedov. Pyfer has only tasted defeat in the UFC on one occasion when he dropped a decision to Jack Hermansson but overall he’s gone 6-1 in the octagon with five finishes along the way.\n\nWhite also announced a previously confirmed flyweight fight between former champion Alexa Grasso and Maycee Barber for the co-main event.\n\nThe finalized card and bout order for UFC Seattle have not been announced yet.",

Washington's struggles this season gives them the advantage of a top-10 pick to offer to Vegas. Dan Quinn would get the marquee pass-rusher he needs to improve the Commanders defense and the Raiders would be able to potentially add a quarterback at No. 1 and a foundational defensive prospect at No. 7.\"\n\nThat big cap space is a key here.\n\nCrosby signed a three-year, $106 million contract extension before the 2025 NFL season. He'll be owed more than $40 million per year for the duration of his time conceptually in Washington.\n\nBut he'd be worth it. Crosby remains one of the best in the NFL.

    "fullText": "Milos Raonic officially announced that he would be retiring from professional tennis.\n\nRaonic is a former Wimbledon finalist, but he had not competed since 2024 after struggling with injuries.\n\nAfter confirming that he would no longer be competing, Raonic received a message from Boris Becker on social media.\n\nRaonic was also messaged by his compatriot Felix Auger-Aliassime, and now John Isner has made a big claim about the Canadian’s career.\n\nIsner was one of many people to congratulate Raonic on his career after the announcement was made, and he continued to speak about the former world number four on the Nothing Major Podcast.\n\nWhen reflecting on his 16-year career, Isner called Raonic the greatest Canadian tennis player of all time, ahead of both Felix Auger-Aliassime and Denis Shapovalov.\n\n“Me personally, I thought Milos had a fantastic career, I mean everyone would obviously agree,” said Isner. “He had a fantastic career, got to three in the world and reached a Slam final.\n\n“Plagued by a lot of injuries, but in my mind he’s right now, maybe Felix or Denis can surpass him, he’s the best Canadian player of all time. To reach three in the world and get to a Slam final, I think we would all like to say congrats to Milos on a really fantastic career.”\n\nRaonic is the highest ranked Canadian singles player in history, and is the only man from his nation to reach a Grand Slam final as of yet.\n\nHowever, he is not the only Canadian singles player to reach a Grand Slam final, with both Bianca Andreescu and Leylah Fernandez also achieving this feat.\n\nFernandez lost to Emma Raducanu in the 2021 US Open final, while Andreescu went all the way to the title in New York in 2019.\n\nAlthough Raonic is not the only Canadian to reach a major final, he has won the same number of titles as both Andreescu and Fernandez combined.\n\nThis is likely to change though, as Fernandez is just 23 years old, while injury-plagued Andreescu is 25 years of age.",

    "description": "FC Bayern wants to keep up its high scoring ways.",
    "fullText": "If Bayern Munich can score eight goals against FC Köln like it did vs. VfL Wolfsburg, Vincent Kompamy will be a very happy man. Who wouldn’t?\n\nThe Belgian is not expecting that many goals, but would like to see his team continue onward with that style of play and mindset.\n\n“I hope this continues for a while. But what the boys showed on Sunday isn’t normal, we mustn’t forget that. The motivation is there, we want to see how far we can take this form. We know it’s not easy in Köln, we had a very tough first half in the cup there, it took 90 minutes to make the difference. But we feel we can always score goals,” said Kompany (as captured by @iMiaSanMia).\n\nAs always, the health of the squad was a big point of discussion at the head coach’s press conference. Interestingly. Kompany was finally asked about the status of Sacha Boey and gave a somewhat evasive response, but it does acknowledge a long-term sickness that was reportedly been going on since mid-December.\n\n“From a purely sporting perspective, he was unlucky; he was in a good phase – and then got sick at the wrong time. Now it’s just a matter of waiting until he’s healthy again,” Kompany said.\n\nBayern Munich sporting director Christoph Freund also jumped in to address Boey’s bizarre situation.\n\n“It was a bitter blow that he was ill for so long and still isn’t fit. We needed him during this phase; the most important thing is that he gets fit again. But there’s a lot of competition for that position,” Freund stated.\n\nWith Boey sick, the right-back position is a bit banged up because of the injury sustained by Josip Stanišić as well. In addition, Kompany acknowledged that Alphonso Davies is still sick as well.\n\n“Stani will no longer play in January. And even in February, he could be out for a few weeks. It depends on his recovery,” Kompany said. “(Davies is) ill, it’s winter so that can always happen. He didn’t really have a preparation, and now he’s sick, so it’s not ideal. I hope he can be back in training this week.”\n\nIllness seems to be an issue at the moment as Serge Gnabry was also felled last weekend.\n\n“Serge was ill on Sunday. It’s January, so a few players are not feeling well, it’s normal. Serge has shown a lot of quality for us this season. We shouldn’t forget that. He can play on the left, on the right, at the #10 position and always brings his quality.

    "description": "Arenado's modest on-field projection entering his age-35 season plus a no-trade clause meant that there were minimal expectations regarding the Cardinals' ability to reel in a return of significant value.",
    "fullText": "The St. Louis Cardinals continued their offseason of offloading on Tuesday, completing a deal with the Arizona Diamondbacks to send highly accomplished third baseman Nolan Arenado to the desert in exchange for right-hander Jack Martinez, Arizona’s eighth round pick last summer.\n\nAt first glance, seeing a possible future Hall of Famer swapped for a minor-league arm who has yet to even throw a professional pitch looks jarringly imbalanced, but this trade is the product of a multitude of factors hovering over the names involved. It is the end result of a saga dating back to last offseason in which the Cardinals sought to rid themselves of Arenado’s onerous contract while also affording the veteran the opportunity to play for a contending team elsewhere while St. Louis shifts its organizational focus to the future rather than going all out to chase a championship in the short term. And while Arenado’s name still carries significant weight league-wide as one of the most decorated position players of his generation, it’s impossible to ignore the degree to which his performance has declined in recent years, which heavily informs the nature of the deal.\n\nArenado was an all-around force early in his career with the Colorado Rockies, compiling gaudy numbers at the plate playing half his games at Coors Field while playing generational defense at third base, earning a Gold Glove in all eight years of his Denver tenure. Traded to St. Louis just two seasons into the eight-year, $260 million extension he signed with Colorado before the 2019 season, Arenado quickly proved his superstar stats weren’t merely the product of the hitter-friendly high-altitude in Colorado, delivering a spectacular 2022 season that saw him finish third in NL MVP voting. He continued to shine early on in his third season as a Cardinal in 2023, making his eighth career All-Star Game, but his production plummeted in the second half of that season, and has trended in the wrong direction ever since. His once otherworldly glove now merely rates as good, and his bat has sunk to slightly below league-average: Among 120 hitters with at least 1,000 plate appearances over the past two seasons, Arenado’s 95 wRC+ ranks 107th.\n\nMost crucially, Arenado held significant power within these negotiations, as the no-trade clause in his contract enabled him to green-light his destination once the Cardinals were able to find a willing trade partner. Arenado famously rejected an agreed-upon trade to the Astros during last offseason in hopes that a different suitor would emerge before the 2025 season, but that never happened, nor did a trade come to fruition at last year’s trade deadline while Arenado was in the midst of his worst season as a big leaguer. Nevertheless, Arenado and the Cardinals entered this offseason once again steadfast on finding a trade fit so both sides could move on, recognizing that moving the $41M owed to Arenado of the next two seasons would be difficult considering his recent performance.\n\n[Get more Diamondbacks news: Arizona team feed]\n\nAs such, Arenado’s modest on-field projection entering his age-35 season plus the fact that he still wielded a no-trade clause that enabled him to largely dictate his destination meant that there were minimal expectations regarding the Cardinals’ ability to reel in a return of significant value. That Martinez is the only player Arizona had to part with and that St. Louis is covering $31M of the $42M owed to Arenado over the next two seasons fully validates those low expectations.\n\nThe D-Backs are a team that has spent much of the winter involved \n\nFirst, it was the possibility that the Snakes would be willing to trade star second baseman Ketel Marte, a delicate gambit in theory intended to leverage their strong position player depth by dealing the ultra-valuable Marte in exchange for sorely-needed young pitching. Meanwhile, there was also consistent reporting that the D-backs were expressing interest in free agent third baseman Alex Bregman, perhaps as a creative avenue to replace Marte in the event they did trade him and his salary (and production) elsewhere. Ultimately, general manager Mike Hazen determined last week that Marte was no longer available in trade discussions. A few days later, Bregman agreed to a deal with the Chicago Cubs, rendering both intriguing scenarios irrelevant despite weeks of speculation.\n\nExactly how serious Arizona was in its pursuit of Bregman is unclear, but those rumors did suggest the club viewed third base as an area of need. That’s not an enormous surprise considering the Snakes had dealt away Eugenio Suarez at last year’s trade deadline, but it also seemed reasonable to look at Arizona’s depth chart and view this as a chance finally give the keys to 23-year-old Jordan Lawlar, the top infield prospect who has consistently raked in the minors but has yet prove himself in the majors, in part due to the series of injuries that has limited his availability. A sensible path for Arizona could have been to roll with Lawlar at third base and focus its offseason strategy and spending almost exclusively on adding much-needed pitching.\n\nEvidently, Arizona still viewed Arenado for what will only cost $11M over the next two seasons as a worthy upgrade. It’s more likely that says more the degree to which even this diminished version of Arenado could be a bargain at that price than Arizona’s confidence in Lawlar long-term, but it is an interesting roster-construction choice nonetheless. Just as we just saw with the Cubs signing Bregman despite the presence of a talented young infielder in Matt Shaw, contending teams are often willing to add veteran certainty even if it costs young, less-proven players playing time. That’s not to say Arenado should be expected to make remotely the same level of impact as Bregman in Chicago, but it’s also not hard to imagine Arizona liking the idea of adding a well-respected veteran like Arenado to a position player group that skews quite young. And if he can even provide some stability at third base more than any semblance of star power he still has left, that could play a meaningful role in boosting Arizona’s chances of staying afloat in what is expected to be another heated National League postseason race.\n\nSpeaking of the Snakes chasing a return to the postseason, If there is something still lacking on Arenado’s loaded résumé, it’s any semblance of memorable postseason success. Arenado has made just four trips to the postseason in his 13 years in the majors — two with Colorado and two with St. Louis — but has never advanced beyond the division series. He hasn’t exactly shined in those limited opportunities — he has just five hits in 33 career postseason at-bats — but in general, his lack of October experience obviously has far less to do with his own efforts and more about the teams he has been a part of.\n\nWith that in mind, as his career winds down, it’s understandable that Arenado would prioritize a club with ambitions of contending when surveying the landscape of possible trade destinations. Of course, it wasn’t entirely up to Arenado, as a team that what he was looking for still needed to step up and view Arenado as a worthwhile addition. Acknowledging that Arenado likely didn’t have a wealth of contending teams desperate for a player of his current caliber, Arizona is a pretty solid landing spot, all things considered.",

    "fullText": "Jason Kelce is not pleased with the Philadelphia Eagles' exit from the 2025 NFL Playoffs, calling out his former NFL team for their \"mediocre\" and \"unacceptable\" performance.\n\nWhile Jason Kelce retired from the league in March 2024, the Super Bowl champion revealed he is still invested in the team's performance and is disappointed the current roster will not have a chance to compete for another title.\n\n\"[The Eagles] had their chances to win that game yesterday, and the players didn't make the plays!\"@JasonKelce acknowledges the coaching issues throughout the year, but holds the players accountable for losing against the 49ers 😳 pic.twitter.com/EiBdITdGXs\n\n— NFL on ESPN (@ESPNNFL) January 13, 2026\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles fans were hopeful their team would return to the Super Bowl in February 2026. However, they've been adjusting to their new reality after losing to Christian McCaffrey and the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday, January 11, in a 24-19 thriller.\n\nOn the Jan. 12 broadcast of ESPN's \"Monday Night Countdown,\" Jason addressed his former team's performance, admitting it wasn't \"the best\" before criticizing the athletes for failing to get the job done.\n\n\"They had the No. 1, highest-paid offense in the league and were mediocre across the board. That’s unacceptable,\" he said. \"They had their chances to win that game yesterday, and the players didn’t make the plays! Alright? That’s all I’m going to leave it at.\"\n\nSpeaking with reporters after the game, Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts addressed his team's shortcomings following their stellar 2024 record.\n\n\"I think winning is hard. Nothing about it is easy, especially when you’re trying to repeat,\" Hurts noted. \"Everything was clear for us and what we wanted to accomplish this year, and we came up short, and so you have no choice but to learn from it, especially if you have a great passion about it.\"\n\nHurts continued, taking ownership of the team's loss. \"It all starts with me and ends with me,\" he said.\n\nHurts was not alone in his thinking, as star running back Saquon Barkley weighed in on his team's loss and echoed the stance of Hurts and Jason.\n\nBarkley called the Eagles' downfall \"a common theme for us this year,\" adding that the squad of superstar athletes has done a poor job at \"playing complete football\" when it matters most.\n\n\"Sometimes, you get into this moment and [think] we’ll just figure this out. And it just caught up to us. It’s been the same thing all year,\" Barkley said.\n\nThe team's head coach, Nick Sirianni, also shared what he believes went wrong, calling the team's inability to come together as one their \"story.\"\n\n\"... good first half, didn’t do a good enough job coaching, didn’t do a good enough job executing in the second half, in that third quarter particularly,\" he said. \"Some penalties got us behind the sticks, and we had a hard time overcoming them.\"\n\nAccording to a report from The Blast, Jason also weighed in on his brother, Travis Kelce, and his possible retirement after the Kansas City Chiefs were eliminated from playoff contention on Sunday, Dec. 14.\n\nAfter entering the league in 2013 and securing three Super Bowl wins, Jason told his \"MNF\" co-hosts that he, too, had questions about his brother's future in the league.\n\n\"I'm curious too,\" Jason said. \"In my opinion, to nail that decision, you've got to step away from the game for a little bit.\"\n\nAnd while he waits, Jason gave Travis (who's also gearing up for his lavish wedding with pop star Taylor Swift) a bit of solid advice.\n\n\"Play these last three games, enjoy them with your teammates, enjoy that with your coaches,\" he said. \"The team's going to be different whether you come back or not next year. So, enjoy these last three games and then let it sink in. It'll come to you with time.\"\n\nThe retirement conversation likely hits close to home for Jason, who announced his departure from the league in March 2024.\n\nHis emotional, 40-minute speech sparked a range of reactions from fans and team leaders, including Eagles Chairman and CEO Jeffrey Lurie, who said it would be \"difficult\" to sum up Jason's importance to the organization.\n\n\"He gave everything he had to all of us for 13 years, and he did it in a way that was truly authentic. Jason was an incredible football player; a future Hall of Famer who would have been successful anywhere. But has there ever been a more perfect marriage between a player, a city, and a team?\"",

The only problem is that he's only one year into his four-year extension. The Jets are uniquely positioned to help the Dolphins out. They have $93.7 million in cap space, which is plenty to take on a significant portion of Tagovailoa's contract before cutting it in 2027 with little additional cost.

    "fullText": "EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) — The Los Angeles Chargers fired offensive coordinator Greg Roman and offensive line coach Mike Devlin on Tuesday, two days after the team lost 16-3 to the New England Patriots in the wild-card round of the playoffs.\n\nRoman spent two seasons as the Chargers' OC after previously holding the position with the Baltimore Ravens, Buffalo Bills and San Francisco 49ers. Los Angeles posted back-to-back 11-6 seasons but lost its playoff opener each time, scoring a total of 15 points in the two games.\n\nAfter Sunday night's game, coach Jim Harbaugh was asked if Roman was the right person to be calling plays and declined to give Roman a vote of confidence.\n\n“Right now I don’t have the answers,” he said. “We’re going to look at that, at everything. It really falls on me that we weren't at our best tonight. I don’t have the answers. I wish I did.”\n\nDevlin followed a seven-year career as an offensive lineman for Buffalo and Arizona as an offensive line coach for the Cardinals, Jets, Texans and Ravens before spending the last two seasons with the Cardinals.\n\nLos Angeles lost both of its starting offensive tackles to season-ending injuries, and Chargers quarterbacks were sacked 60 times — second-worst in the NFL — in 2025. Justin Herbert was brought down six times on Sunday night.\n\nThe Chargers haven't won a postseason game since 2018. Herbert is 0-3 in the playoffs for his career.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

    "fullText": "Stephen A. Smith made quite the awkward on-air blunder while discussing the Houston Texans’ 30-6 playoff win Monday over the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nWhile recapping the matchup on ESPN’s “First Take” on Tuesday, the sports commentator misidentified the Texans’ star wide receiver, Christian Kirk, as the late right-wing political commentator Charlie Kirk.\n\nPolitics: Democrat Mary Peltola Launches Senate Bid In Alaska\n\n“We saw Charlie Kirk catch eight receptions for 144 yards,” Smith said before co-host Shae Peppler Cornette interjected to remind him: “Christian Kirk.”\n\nSmith quickly corrected himself. “I’m sorry, I apologize. Oh, my God, Christian Kirk.”\n\nThe verbal slip, which was shared on X by the sports media account Awful Announcing, has already racked up more than 11 million views.\n\nChristian Kirk and his team will play the New England Patriots on Sunday in an NFL divisional round playoff game. It appears that he has not publicly commented on the slip-up.\n\nCharlie Kirk, who co-founded the right-wing nonprofit Turning Point USA, built a massive social media following by holding debates on contentious cultural issues, where he often made incendiary, racist or sexist remarks. He was shot and killed while speaking with students at Utah Valley University on Sept. 10, 2025.\n\nAfter the killing, Smith condemned anyone celebrating Kirk’s death on his SiriusXM radio show.\n\nPolitics: Charlie Kirk Brought Hard-Right Politics To A New Generation\n\n“I don’t care what his political beliefs were. I don’t care what he felt. I care about the fact that a man was gunned down in front of two of his children, who are 5 years of age or less,” he said during the Sep. 11 episode.\n\nHe also praised the New York Yankees for honoring Kirk with a moment of silence ahead of a game against the Detroit Tigers.\n\n“Props to the New York Yankees organization last night for having a moment of silence,” Smith said. “We’re not supposed to condone stuff like this. We’re not supposed to say it’s OK.

    "fullText": "Antoine Semenyo has certainly hit the ground running since arriving in Manchester.\n\nPep Guardiola’s side paid £62m for the 26-year-old forward, who scored and assisted on his debut against Exeter City in the Emirates FA Cup on Saturday.\n\nNow, just three days later, the Ghanaian has impressed again. A Jérémy Doku cross, nudged on at the near post by Bernardo Silva, gave the ex-Bournemouth star a simple finish in the 53rd minute of their Carabao Cup semi-final first leg against Newcastle United – and he came close to doubling his tally ten minutes later, though a lengthy VAR suggested that Erling Haaland had impeded Nick Pope’s vision in the buildup.\n\nRayan Cherki did eventually find that elusive second goal deep inside stoppage time at St James’ Park, although City were left ruing what could prove to be a costly disallowed goal if the Magpies get off to a good start in next month’s second leg at the Etihad.\n\n“The second goal should have counted by the way,” Semenyo told TV cameras as he trodded off the pitch on Tuesday night, and his sentiment was echoed by teammate Bernardo Silva, who suggested that the decision “looks ridiculous”.\n\nBut despite his grievances with the officials, Semenyo revealed that he is “enjoying every moment” of his time at Manchester City, hailing his teammates who “have helped me with my confidence and they’ve made me feel welcome.”\n\n“The whole environment here is perfect,” the forward explained.\n\nThings could yet get even better for Semenyo and his new teammates, as they turn their attention to Saturday’s trip across Manchester to face the Red Devils at Old Trafford. Pep Guardiola’s men will smell blood, relishing an opportunity to close the six-point gap to Arsenal by running riot against Manchester United in the first game of Michael Carrick’s interim spell as head coach.",

    "description": "The Yankees rotation for 2026 is looking strong, even with a few starters sidelined.",
    "fullText": "Yankees projected starting rotation for 2026 season after Ryan Weathers trade originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New York Yankees' rotation for the 2026 season isn't at its full strength at the start of the year. But, even with a few stars, like Gerrit Cole, Carlos Rodon, and Clarke Schmidt potentially sitting out for part of the 2026 season, the rotation is in a good place.\n\nThings got even better when they, according to Craig Mish of Sports Grid, traded four prospects to the Miami Marlins for starter Ryan Weathers.\n\nThe new lefty starter joins the rotation, making the Yankees' projected rotation for 2026 a strong one regardless of the injuries to Cole, Rodon, and Schmidt.\n\n1. Max Fried, LHP\n2. Cam Schlittler, RHP\n3. Will Warren, RHP\n4. Ryan Weathers, LHP\n5. Luis Gil, RHP\n\nThis projected rotation is likely what the Yankees begin the 2026 season with. There could be some change in the order, but this would allow the Yankees to break up their left-handers and right-handers, while putting Fried and Schlittler atop the rotation.\n\nIt's far from ideal, and isn't a World Series-caliber rotation. But, with the return of Cole and Rodon, along with Schmidt and the potential for other starters to emerge through Spring Training, the rotation is overall in a good spot.\n\nOnce Cole and Rodon return, the new-look rotation would be a whole lot better. Fried, Cole, and Schlittler would likely be the main trio, with Warren and Rodon rounding out the five-man rotation.\n\nThat would allow for Weathers, who's started at most 16 games in a season in his career, to take a back-seat as either a sixth man or potentially as a long reliever. The same could happen with Gil.\n\nMore: Yankees get $160 million contract update on Cody Bellinger amid stare-down\n\nOr, if the Yankees wanted to, thanks to the Weathers trade, once Rodon, Schmidt, and Cole are back, they could explore a trade or two with their depth starters this upcoming season.\n\nGil, Warren, or Schmidt might field decent trade interest, allowing the Yankees to upgrade at a position of need if one comes about during the regular season.\n\nWeathers will help keep the Yankees' rotation afloat to begin the year as one of the back-end arms, but once the three injured starters come back, and assuming there aren't any other injuries, then Weathers will be incredible insurance for the rotation.\n\nThe Yankees' projected rotation looks a lot better now that Weathers is on the team, as the five-man rotation to begin the season won't be in as bad a place if none of the three injured starters can go by Opening Day.\n\nMets know what contract they need to give to sign Cody Bellinger\n\nPhillies get bad news on Bo Bichette amid unexpected challenge from Alex Bregman Cubs deal\n\nMLB Hot Stove tracker: Live updates on news, rumors, signings and trades for 2025 free agency\n\nRed Sox linked to frustrating Alex Bregman replacements after Cubs deal\n\nDodgers predicted to poach $189M Silver Slugger, All-Star from Phillies to solve aging dilemma\n\nMets get Kyle Tucker news in free agency\n\nTeam USA World Baseball Classic roster: Bryce Harper, Tarik Skubal among stars on team for 2026 tournament",

Cross’ return will be key as his replacement, tackle Josh Jones, was one of two players who did not practice with a knee injury he suffered in Week 18.\n\nAlongside Cross, rookie tight end Elijah Arroyo was a full participant and should be ready to make his return to the lineup against the 49ers. Safety Coby Bryant was also a full practice participant, which bodes well for his return to the field.\n\nThe report wasn’t all good news, though, as two key defensive pieces were limited on Tuesday. Defensive lineman Demarcus Lawrence was a limited participant with an Achilles injury, and an oblique injury limited what cornerback Tariq Woolen could do in practice. Both Lawrence and Woolen missed time this season and will be key in repeating the Seahawks’ Week 18 performance against the 49ers.\n\nThe Seahawks’ thin linebacker depth doesn’t seem to be improving either, as second-year linebacker Tyrice Knight did not practice.

    "fullText": "Antoine Semenyo has taken to life seamlessly at Manchester City and is already beginning to repay the £62.5m fee handed to Bournemouth to sign him.\n\nSemenyo scored and provided an assist in a memorable debut in the FA Cup third round on Saturday, though that 10-1 trouncing came against League One side Exeter City.\n\nHe then notched his second in as many games, scoring the opener inside the cauldron of St James' Park, helping City take control of their Carabao Cup semi-final against holders Newcastle.\n\nHe later put the ball in the net again, a goal eventually ruled out after a lengthy check from the video assistant referee, before City sealed the 2-0 win.\n\nThe 26-year-old adds a different dimension to City's attack, describing himself as \"powerful, quick and strong\", as well as \"clinical\" - that last attribute could prove to be a vital factor in this season's Premier League title race and City's hunt for silverware.\n\n\"I was in the right area to tap it in and we were victorious so I am happy,\" Semenyo said after the game. \"The whole environment here is perfect.\n\n\"Everyone is confident and wanting to achieve the best. I have come into that and they helped with my confidence and made me feel welcome.\n\n\"It has been a lot but I have enjoyed it so far. I am picking things up very quickly and enjoying it. I am playing with a smile on my face and enjoying every moment.\"\n\nSemenyo is set for another milestone on Saturday if he makes his Premier League debut at Old Trafford in the Manchester derby.\n\n'Game has gone' - bad night for VAR in semi-final\n\nCity's goalscoring burden has fallen mostly on the broad shoulders of star striker Erling Haaland this season, with the Norway international netting 39 goals in 34 games for club and country.\n\nBut the prolific frontman has hit a sticky patch of late, scoring just once in his past six games and last scoring from open play against West Ham on 20 December.\n\nPlaying as a wideman mostly from the right, Semenyo's proficiency in front of goal for Bournemouth has him on 10 Premier League goals so far this season, sitting third on the top-flight scoring charts behind new team-mate Haaland and Brentford's Igor Thiago.\n\nHaaland can not only expect a new avenue of goalscoring service – as showcased by Semenyo's assist against Exeter - but that weight of finding the net can now be shared with a player who scored a total of 32 goals for the Cherries.\n\nSemenyo adds a versatility to City by being able to play anywhere in the front three, enhancing the options available to manager Pep Guardiola.\n\nThe Ghanaian's speed, direct running and cool finishing has already been displayed in Manchester this season, with a brilliantly taken goal against United at Old Trafford in the chaotic 4-4 draw.\n\nGuardiola will be hoping his newest recruit can provide that sort of anarchy and unpredictability alongside the craft and vision of Phil Foden and the magic of Rayan Cherki in the final third.\n\nCity captain Bernardo Silva said: \"He looks not just a very good player but also a very good guy, which fits right in with the team.\n\n\"He is a fantastic guy who wants to help us. Hopefully he can keep going.\"\n\nThough losing another of their star players will no doubt sting, Bournemouth have brought in a sizeable transfer fee for another player they have sold since the end of last season.\n\nSemenyo's sale provides a huge profit on a player they signed for £10m from Championship side Bristol City only three years ago.\n\nThe south coast side have now brought in around £250m since the summer, but have been stripped of another prized asset having already lost Dean Huijsen, Illia Zabarnyi, Milos Kerkez and Dango Ouattara.\n\nBut it means boss Andoni Iraola will have cash to splash not only to replace Semenyo but also improve other areas of the squad.\n\nSemenyo had been heavily linked with a move to Manchester United, but it has proven to be a tumultuous couple of weeks for the Red Devils.\n\nNot only did they miss out on the forward to their bitter rivals, they also sacked head coach Ruben Amorim, with ex-midfielder Michael Carrick taking interim charge for the remainder of the season.\n\nCarrick's first game comes against City on Saturday and Semenyo could have graced the Old Trafford turf in a red shirt, but will instead head to the venue as an opposition player having already hurt the United backline this season.\n\nPremier League leaders Arsenal are aiming for a first title in over two decades and hold a six-point advantage at the summit but will be nervously looking over their shoulders knowing one of their nearest challengers have strengthened their side.\n\nCity are now overloaded with players on the right wing, meaning one of Oscar Bobb or Savinho may well leave the club this January or in the summer.\n\nNorwegian Bobb missed almost the entirety of last season with a leg fracture and is injured again – the 22-year-old has been heavily linked with a move to Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund.\n\nBrazilian Savinho is out of action too and has, at times, been unconvincing since his £31m move from Girona in 2024, struggling to nail down his place in the side, and Tottenham were in talks to sign him during the summer.\n\nGuardiola has said attacking players are judged by their output but the 21-year-old has managed to contribute only two goals and three assists in 23 appearances this season.\n\nLatest Manchester City news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man City - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Manchester City's 2-0 win over Newcastle in the first leg of the Carabao Cup semi-final was overshadowed by a contentious decision to disallow a goal from Antoine Semenyo in the second half.\n\nThe £65m January signing fired City ahead on 53 minutes and thought he had added a second 10 minutes later when he flicked Tijjani Reijnders' cross past Nick Pope.\n\nHowever, the forward was denied a third goal in two games for his new side after a five-and-a-half-minute VAR check adjudged Erling Haaland to have interfered with play from an offside position.\n\n\"The second goal should have stood,\" Semenyo said after the game.\n\nHaaland was jostling for position with Newcastle's Malick Thiaw when he was deemed to have obstructed the defender from stopping Semenyo's effort.\n\nReferee Chris Kavanagh watched the incident several times on the pitch-side monitor before announcing his decision to disallow the goal to the St James' Park crowd.\n\nSpeaking to Sky Sports after the game, Pep Guardiola said the disallowed goal will make his side \"stronger\".\n\nCaptain Bernardo Silva also voiced his frustration with the decision, particularly after the Premier League's Key Match Incidents Panel admitted Phil Foden was wrongfully denied a penalty in his side's Premier League defeat at the same venue earlier this season.\n\n\"It should have been 3-0 but we are quite used to this at the moment,\" said Silva.\n\n\"It is so frustrating because the last time we came here we also had a lot of decisions go against us.\"\n\nCity eventually scored a second deep into stoppage time when Rayan Cherki fired past Pope.\n\nSemenyo scores again - who are winners and losers of his arrival?\n\nMan City take control of semi-final with Newcastle\n\nVAR errors increase: Each of the 13 mistakes so far this season\n\nAfter a weekend where supporters enjoyed the FA Cup without VAR, this was the antithesis of the fans' football experience at St James' Park.\n\nIt took five minutes and 30 seconds from the moment Semenyo scored what he thought was Manchester City's second goal until referee Kavanagh made the VAR sign to disallow it.\n\nThe job of the VAR, Stuart Attwell, was made harder because the semi-automated offside technology failed, as it did when the two teams met in the Premier League in December. The players were too close together, so it meant Attwell had to revert to the old technology and draw lines.\n\nThe decision is technically correct in law, because Haaland was offside and in direct contact with a defender who could possibly have stopped the ball going into the goal.\n\nBut fans won't see it that way. They will see a perfectly legitimate goal with an offside offence which wouldn't have been noticed but for VAR.\n\nIf the decision had been quick, there would have been much more confidence. But the extended delay adds to the controversy and gives the impression the VAR was not certain. It would have been better if the VAR had left this alone.\n\nA decision being technically right is not necessarily what the game wants in this context.\n\nFormer Chelsea and Blackburn Rovers striker Chris Sutton agreed with Guardiola and Silva and said Kavanagh's verdict looked like a \"sheer guess\".\n\n\"I think the game has gone,\" added Sutton. \"Is Thiaw really going to stop that? The distance from Semenyo is a yard, a yard and a half. Thiaw is not going to react to that.\"\n\nEx-Liverpool and England midfielder Jamie Redknapp and Newcastle defender Dan Burn said it was the correct call to rule out Semenyo's effort, though both criticised the process.\n\n\"If they had given the goal there wouldn't be one person that looked at this and thought it shouldn't have been allowed,\" said Redknapp.\n\n\"But by the letter of the law, whether we like it or not, it is the right decision.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Burn, who missed the game through injury, added: \"I do think it is the right decision, I just don't like the subjective offside. It's either offside, or it's not.\n\n\"We don't want to see that, but by the letter of the law it should be disallowed.\"\n\nFormer Manchester City defender Micah Richards said: \"I understand the process but VAR wasn't brought in for this reason here.\n\n\"This is anti-goal which they said they weren't going to do, they said they weren't going to re-referee the game.\n\n\"This for me is re-refereeing the game. They are both going at it. It might be right, but I don't think we should be taking away goals for this. Why take five minutes?\"\n\nAman: Get rid of VAR! It's a joke, the officials are trying to find reasons to not award goals! There was no reason to rule out that second goal!\n\nMick: The worst VAR decision I have ever seen. There are re-refereeing the game.\n\nGeorge: As fans we didn't ask for VAR, it was pushed upon us and it's ruined the game. As soon as the ref goes to the screen we all know how it's going to pan out. It all just takes too long. Rubbish.\n\nFinn: So VAR has decided that Haaland made Pope jump forward and try to stop the shot. WOW. Laughable.\n\nIan: That was a terrible decision of offside, you couldn't tell if it was on or offside! If it's not obvious it should be a goal! Football is supposed to be about scoring goals! VAR killing the game slowly.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Michigan defensive back Elijah Dotson has committed to Missouri out of the NCAA transfer portal, per On3’s Hayes Fawcett. Dotson spent just one season with the Wolverines out of high school.\n\nDuring that season, Dotson played in 12 games at Michigan. He recorded 11 tackles, an interception and a pass defended, showing a knack for finding the ball and getting hands on it.\n\nPrior to enrolling at Michigan, Elijah Dotson was ranked as a top-100 prospect and a four-star recruit. He checked in at No. 94 nationally in the 2025 class, according to the Rivals Industry Rankings. He also checked in as the No. 12 cornerback in the class and the No. 2 overall player from the state of Michigan, hailing from Detroit (MI) Belleville High School.\n\nIn high school, Elijah Dotson was also a track star. He specialized in the 100- and 300-meter hurdles, ending as an All-State finisher five times in those events. He was also a four-time AAU Junior Olympian and a three-time New Balance All-American.\n\nHe posted personal bests in the 100-meter dash of 11.36 and in the 200-meter dash at 23.08. Quite strong times for a high school athlete.\n\nIn addition to Elijah Dotson, former UConn quarterback Nick Evers has committed to Missouri via the NCAA transfer portal, per On3’s Pete Nakos and Hayes Fawcett. He is the No. 116 QB in On3’s 2026 Transfer Portal Player Rankings.\n\nEvers made three appearances for UConn this past season. In his limited action, he completed 10-of-15 pass attempts for 105 yards and a touchdown, without throwing an interception.\n\nEvers transferred to UConn ahead of the 2024 campaign. He began that season as the team’s starter and made nine appearances. He finished the 2024 season with 918 passing yards and five touchdowns, while throwing five interceptions. He also recorded 245 yards and three scores in the ground game.\n\nPrior to joining UConn, Evers spent one season at Wisconsin. He didn’t see any action for the Badgers.\n\nEvers began his collegiate career at Oklahoma. In the 2022 season, Evers made one appearance and failed to complete his lone pass attempt.",

The Red Elephants ended up losing in the 5A state title game to Thomas County Central, 62-21.\n\nGainesville went through a tumultuous 2025 season, which was highlighted when the GHSA previously suspended 39 players after the conclusion of an investigation into a sideline-clearing brawl took place in the third quarter of a Class AAAAA second round playoff contest between the Gainesville and Brunswick.\n\nThe GHSA eventually allowed Gainesville to proceed through the Class 5A playoffs and permitted use of the 39 players, with the Red Elephants then going on to defeat Langston Hughes and Rome en route to the state championship game. That up and down season was the prelude to Gainesville’s news-filled off-season.\n\nThe Red Elephants have already seen former head coach Josh Niblett leave for a coaching position at Colorado University under Deion Sanders and Gainesville ended up hiring Santavious Bryant, the former lead man at Grayson.\n\nGainesville finished No. 7 in the final 2025 Georgia high school football rankings.\n\nGainesville High School, located in Gainesville, Georgia, is a respected public school known for its strong academics, competitive athletics, and vibrant extracurricular programs. Offering a range of AP and honors courses, the school prepares students for higher education and future careers. Gainesville’s athletic teams are highly successful, often achieving regional and state recognition. Emphasizing leadership, community involvement, and personal development, the school ensures students are well-rounded and ready for future challenges.\n\nFor Georgia high school football fans looking to keep up with scores around the nation, staying updated on the action is now easier than ever with the Rivals High School Scoreboard.

    "description": "The Yankees will send four position player prospects to Miami to add to their possible rotation.",
    "fullText": "It’s been 97 days since the Yankees were eliminated in Game 4 of the ALDS by the eventual pennant-winning Toronto Blue Jays. While the Yankees have done some minor housekeeping in the offseason, they have yet to add an external player who isn’t a waiver claim, on a minor-league deal, or dealing with Rule 5 shenanigans. That changed, however, on Tuesday night.\n\nPer the YES Network’s Jack Curry, the Yankees are acquiring left-handed pitcher Ryan Weathers from the Miami Marlins in exchange for four prospects. Marlins reporter Craig Mish was first on the four prospects being moved: outfielders Dillon Lewis and Brendan Jones, and infielders Dylan Jasso and Juan Matheus.\n\nIn exchange for Weathers, the Yankees parted with Dillon Lewis, Brendan Jones, Dylan Jasso and Juan Matheus. @CraigMish was on it with the minor leaguers involved in the deal.\n\n— JackCurryYES (@JackCurryYES) January 14, 2026\n\nWeathers is a former No. 7 overall pick by the Padres back in 2018 out of Loretto High School in Tennessee. After a solid full-season in A-ball in 2019 a rare playoff MLB debut during the COVID 2020 season, he made the Padres’ Opening Day roster in 2021. He had skipped the top three levels of the minor leagues and ended up throwing 94.2 innings across 30 appearances (18 starts), struggling to a 5.32 ERA. After realizing they rushed one of their top prospects, the Padres sent him back to Triple-A in 2022, where he spent nearly the entire season aside from one MLB spot start in May. Weathers struggled again in the majors in 2023 before being shipped to Miami for former Yankees first baseman Garrett Cooper at the 2023 Trade Deadline.\n\nEntering the 2024 season, Weathers’ luster had gone away with a 5.88 ERA in 156 innings in his career, but he found something in Miami. His fastball velocity steadily increased, going from 95.1 in 2023 to 96.8 in 2025, and his approach was refined to throw fewer four-seamers and more sinkers. It’s allowed him to throw 125 innings of sub-4 ERA ball with a 4.26 FIP, and an improved strikeout-to-walk ratio (15.2 K-BB%).\n\nThe hang-up since Weathers has been in Miami, however, is injuries. He missed three months with an index finger strain in 2024 and missed time with both a forearm and lat strain in 2025, limiting him to a total of 24 starts in two seasons.\n\nThere’s potential for Weathers to work out of the bullpen (like his right-handed father David, a 1996 World Series champion with the Yanks), but he currently figures to be part of a rotation that Brian Cashman has been scrambling to find upgrades to. With Max Fried, Cam Schlittler, Luis Gil, and Will Warren currently penciled into the Opening Day rotation with Gerrit Cole, Clarke Schmidt, and Carlos Rodón due to miss the start of the season, Weathers likely slides Ryan Yarbrough into the bullpen — assuming no other moves are made. What happens when the calvary returns will depend on how he fares, and who happens to be healthy at the time. The rotation insurance is key.\n\nWeathers will make $1.35 million in 2026 and has two further years of arbitration remaining, becoming a free agent after the 2028 campaign. He also has a minor-league option remaining, giving the Yankees valuable flexibility in case of a roster crunch.\n\nAs for the prospects heading to Miami, MLB Pipeline ranks Jones and Lewis as the Yankees’ No. 15 and No. 16 prospects, as well as Jasso at No. 23. Jones stole 51 bases across High-A and Double-A in 2025 while boasting a .359 OBP. Lewis went 20/20 at High-A Hudson Valley in 2025. Both were selected in the back-half of the team’s 2024 draft, and Baseball America was even a little higher on Lewis, ranking him eighth in the organization.\n\nJasso was an undrafted free agent out of New Mexico Junior College in 2023 and had been a consistent presence for Double-A Somerset for the past year and a half. He made BA’s Top 30, while Matheus was on the outside looking in; the latter hit .275 with 40 stolen bases in A-ball in 2025.\n\nWe’ll have more to come, but in the meantime, welcome a second Weathers to New York!",

Cruver appeared in two total games during his time in Boca Raton while attempting three career passes, so this is more of a depth addition than anything else.\n\nCruver will be a redshirt junior in 2026 with two years of eligibility remaining. He joins a quarterback room that includes Notre Dame’s Kenny Minchey and Marshall’s JacQai Long, as well as returnee Brennen Ward and incoming 4-star QB Matt Ponatoski.\n\nOn special teams, the Wildcats added Murray State punter Tom O’Hara.\n\nO’Hara is the third specialist addition for Stein and the Wildcats, joining South Florida kicker Adam Zouagui and Georgia State long-snapper Spencer Radnoti.\n\nO’Hara averaged 44.9 yards per punt in 2024, the third-best in the Missouri Valley. Last fall, he averaged 43.8 yards per punt.\n\nAdding O’Hara keeps the Australian pipeline going at punter for the Wildcats.

However Adesanya has fallen on a downward slide of late, losing his past three bouts since he last held gold.\n\nPyfer has quickly emerged as one of the UFC’s most spotlighted middleweight prospects, pairing raw athleticism with finishing instincts and an increasingly confident cage presence. A main event against a global star like Adesanya fast-tracks him into the title conversation after three straight wins. If Pyfer can deliver the upset, it could instantly alter the middleweight championship picture.\n\nThe co-main event carries its own stakes and storyline. Grasso and Barber first met in 2021, with the matchup now resurfacing as both continue to push toward the championship at 125 pounds. Grasso’s technical polish and composure have made her one of the division’s most consistent performers, as seen in her win over Barber. Barber’s aggression and durability continue to fuel her rise, but she's refined her game since that loss and now rides a seven-fight win streak.\n\nThe current UFC Seattle fight lineup:\n\nMiddleweight: Israel Adesanya vs. Joe Pyfer\n\nWomen’s flyweight: Alexa Grasso vs. Maycee Barber\n\nHeavyweight: Valter Walker vs. Marcin Tybura\n\nWomen’s flyweight: Casey O’Neill vs. Gabriella Fernandes\n\nWomen’s strawweight: Nicolle Caliari vs. Caroline Foro\n\nMiddleweight: Mansur Abdul-Malik vs. Yousri Belgaroui\n\nFeatherweight: Zhu Kangjie vs. Márcio Barbosa",

    "fullText": "Pass rush was once again a hit-and-miss issue for the Cincinnati Bengals in 2025, ranking in the bottom third in sacks. Injuries to Trey Hendrickson and Shemar Stewart were the main cause, though the Bengals did get contributions from Myles Murphy and Joseph Ossai.\n\nExpect the Bengals to address the area again this offseason, in part because Hendrickson is set to become a free agent again and may end up walking.\n\nThat’s the direction the Bengals go in the latest mock draft from Pro Football Focus, going with David Bailey of Texas Tech with the 10th overall pick.\n\n\"The Bengals selected one of the best run-defending edge rushers in the first round of last year’s draft in Shemar Stewart and selected the best pass-rusher in this year’s class with Bailey here. He leads all FBS defenders in PFF grade (93.1), pass-rush grade (93.9), pressures (81) and sacks (15).\"\n\nBailey transferred to Texas Tech after a solid three years at Stanford. He burst into the national spotlight with 15 sacks, helping transform Texas Tech’s defense and vaulting them into a top-five team, a Big 12 championship and a spot in the College Football Playoffs.\n\nIf the Bengals go with Bailey, they could have the potential to sport one of the pass-rushing duos in the league with Bailey and Stewart, two young and developing talents on the edge.\n\nThe Bengals recorded just 35 sacks in 2025. A healthy Stewart and the upside of Bailey could strongly boost that number going forward.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Bengals Wire: Bengals land NFL draft's 'best pass-rusher' in new mock",

    "description": "Our gut microbiome has a huge influence on our overall health, but we haven't been clear on the specific bacteria with good versus bad effects. Now, a study of more than 34,000 people is shedding light on what a healthy gut microbiome actually consists of",
    "fullText": "We often hear talk of things being good for our microbiome, and in turn, good for our health. But it wasn’t entirely clear what a healthy gut microbiome consisted of. Now, a study of more than 34,000 people has edged us closer towards understanding the mixes of microbes that reliably signal we have low inflammation, good immunity and healthy cholesterol levels.\n\nYour gut microbiome can influence your immune system, rate of ageing and your risk of poor mental health. Despite a profusion of home tests promising to reveal the make-up of your gut community, their usefulness has been debated, because it is hard to pin down what a “good” microbial mix is.\n\nThe shocking discovery that our gut microbiome drives ageing\n\nPrevious measures mainly looked at species diversity, with a greater array of bacteria being better. But it is difficult to identify particular communities of interacting organisms that are implicated in a specific aspect of our health, because microbiomes vary so much from person to person.\n\n“There is a very intricate relationship between the food we eat, the composition of our gut microbiome and the effects the gut microbiome has on our health. The only way to try to map these connections is having large enough sample sizes,” says Nicola Segata at the University of Trento in Italy.\n\nTo create such a map, Segata and his colleagues have assessed a dataset from more than 34,500 people who took part in the PREDICT programme in the UK and US, run by microbiome testing firm Zoe, and validated the results against data from 25 other cohorts from Western countries.\n\nYour science-backed guide to the easy habits that will help you sleep well, stress less, eat smarter and age better.\n\nOf the thousands of species that reside in the human gut, the researchers focused on 661 bacterial species that were found in more than 20 per cent of the Zoe participants. They used this to determine the 50 bacteria most associated with markers of good health – assessed via markers such as body mass index and blood glucose levels – and the 50 most linked to poor health.\n\nThe 50 “good bug” species – 22 of which are new to science – seem to influence four key areas: cholesterol levels; inflammation and immune health; body fat distribution; and blood sugar control.\n\nThe participants who were deemed healthy, because they had no known medical conditions, had about 3.6 more of these species than people with a condition, while people at a healthy weight hosted about 5.2 more of them than those with obesity.\n\nThe researchers suggest that good or bad health outcomes may come about due to the vital role the gut microbiome plays in releasing chemicals involved in cholesterol transport, inflammation reduction, fat metabolism and insulin sensitivity.\n\nAs to the specific species that were present, most microbes in both the “good” and “bad” rankings belong to the Clostridia class. Within this class, species in the Lachnospiraceae family featured 40 times, with 13 seemingly having favourable effects and 27 unfavourable.\n\nWhy caring for your microbiome is crucial if you want to live to 100\n\nOur friendly – and not so friendly – gut bacteria lie at the core of healthy ageing. Research is now revealing what it takes to maintain a youthful microbiome\n\n“The study highlights bacterial groups that could be further investigated regarding their potential positive or negative impact [on] health conditions, such as high blood glucose levels or obesity,” says Ines Moura at the University of Leeds, UK.\n\nThe link between these microbes and diet was assessed via food questionnaires and data logged on the Zoe app, where users are advised to aim for at least 30 different plants a week and at least three portions a day of fermented foods, with an emphasis on fibre and not too many ultra-processed options.\n\nThe researchers found that most of the microbes either aligned with a generally healthy diet and better health, or with a worse diet and poorer health. But 65 of the 661 microbes didn’t fit in.\n\n“These 65 bacteria are a testament to the fact that the picture is still more complex than what we saw,” says Segata, who also works as a consultant for Zoe. “The effects may depend on the other microbes that are there, or the specific strain of the bacterium or the specific diet.”\n\nThis sorting of “good” versus “bad” bacteria has enabled the researchers to create a 0 to 1000 ranking scale for the overall health of someone’s gut microbiota, which is already used as part of Zoe’s gut health tests.\n\n“Think of a healthy gut microbiome as a community of chemical factories. We want large numbers of species, we want the good ones outnumbering the bad ones, and when you get that, then you’re producing really healthy chemicals, which have impacts across the body,” says team member Tim Spector at King’s College London, co-founder of Zoe.\n\nThe surprising relationship between your microbiome and sleeping well\n\nResearch is revealing the complex relationship between sleep and the gut microbiome, raising the prospect that eating better during the day might help you get a better night’s rest\n\nThis doesn’t mean the ideal healthy gut microbiome has been pinned down, though. “Defining a healthy microbiome is a difficult task, as the gut microbiome composition is impacted by diet, but it can also change with environmental factors, age and health conditions that require long-term medication,” says Moura.\n\n“We really need to think about our body and our microbiome as two complex systems that together make one even more complex system,” says Segata. “When you change one thing, everything is modified a bit as a consequence. Understanding what is cause and effect in many cases can be very intricate.”\n\nBigger studies are needed to tease out these links and cover more of the global population, says Segata. However, once we have established the baseline of your health and microbiome, it should become possible to recommend specific foods to tweak your gut bacteria, he says.\n\nNature DOI: 10.1038/s41586-025-09854-7\n\nReceive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox.

This comes after multiple Reddit users reported yesterday that Logi Options Plus — the app required to manage and configure the controls on Logitech accessories — had stopped working, preventing them from using customized scrolling features, button actions, and gestures.\n\nOne Reddit user said that the scroll directions and extra buttons on their Logitech mouse “were not working as I intended” and that the Logi Options Plus app became stuck in a boot loop upon opening it to identify the cause. Logitech has since acknowledged the situation and said that its G Hub app — a similar management software for gaming devices under the Logitech G brand — was also affected.\n\nAccording to Logitech’s support page, the problem was caused by “an expired certificate” required for the apps to run. Windows users were unaffected. The issues only impacted Mac users because macOS prevents certain applications from running if it doesn’t detect a valid Developer ID certificate, something that has affected other apps in the past.\n\nA patch has now been released to fix the issue, which needs to be manually installed “because the certificate also affected the in‑app updater.” Logitech says that the device settings, customizations, and profiles for impacted users will remain intact after installing the patch. This fix is available for devices running on macOS 26 Tahoe, macOS 15 Sequoia, macOS 14 Sonoma, and macOS 13 Ventura, with a fix for older versions of macOS coming “at a later time.”\n\n“We dropped the ball here. This is an inexcusable mistake,” Logitech spokesperson ATXsantucci said in response to user complaints on Reddit. “We’re extremely sorry for the inconvenience caused.”",

    "fullText": "Matthew Landry, a dietitian, studies how our diets can prevent heart attacks later in life.\n\nLandry recommends making simple food swaps to control cholesterol levels.\n\nOpt for olive oil over butter and chicken over red meat, he said.\n\nA nutrition researcher and dietitian who studies how simple habits can protect our hearts shared three simple food swaps.\n\nCardiovascular disease is the No. 1 cause of death in the US, but research has found that eating a Mediterranean-style diet and being physically active can help lower the risk. The American Heart Association's dietary guidelines recommend prioritizing fresh produce, whole grains, lean proteins such as fish, and limiting ultra-processed foods and refined sugar.\n\nThat may sound like a lot, but Matthew Landry told Business Insider that you don't necessarily need to overhaul your diet to improve your heart health.\n\nLandy, an assistant professor at the University of California, Irvine, suggested considering: \"how can we make simple swaps with our diet? How can we engage in more physical activity, and do very simple things that all add up to help prevent a heart attack later?\"\n\nHere are his three suggestions:\n\nLandry's first swap relates to the type of fat used for cooking. He suggests switching butter or lard for heart-healthy fats like olive oil or avocado oil.\n\n\"We're not necessarily changing the food, we're just changing how we're sometimes preparing it,\" he said.\n\nAnimal products and full-fat dairy products like beef tallow, butter, and cream contain saturated fat, which can drive up our LDL or \"bad cholesterol levels, Landry said. If a person has too much LDL cholesterol in their blood, it can form a sticky plaque in their arteries, putting them at greater risk of heart disease.\n\nWe need fat as part of a balanced diet, but unsaturated fats, found in foods such as avocados, fatty fish, nuts, and olive oil, don't raise our LDL cholesterol nearly as much as saturated fat, he said.\n\nThere's one finding that keeps cropping up in Landry's research: reducing red meat consumption lowers the risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nLandry worked on a 2023 study in which 22 pairs of identical twins were assigned either a vegan or an omnivorous diet for eight weeks. It was the focus of a Netflix documentary titled \"You Are What You Eat: A Twin Experiment.\"\n\nThis doesn't mean you have to cut out meat entirely, Landry said, but he recommended swapping red and processed meats, including beef, pork, and sausages, for leaner options like poultry, such as chicken and turkey, or fish, which are lower in saturated fat.\n\nIt's also a good idea to add plant-based protein sources to your diet. \"Eventually, I would love for folks to even move further than that and start consuming some plant-based proteins, some beans, lentils, tofu, tempeh. Those are great things for our heart as well,\" he said.\n\nFiber is great at keeping cholesterol levels \"nice and stable,\" Landry said, but most Americans don't eat enough. Ninety percent of women, and 97% of men, don't meet the recommended 30 grams of fiber a day, according to the 2020 to 2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The 2025 to 2030 guidelines recommend two to four servings of whole grains a day.\n\nWhole grains such as brown rice, quinoa, and whole-wheat bread are good sources of fiber and can easily replace their white counterparts, which tend to be low in fiber. One cup of brown rice, for example, contains 3.5 grams of fiber, while a cup of white rice contains 0.6 grams.\n\n\"We can still have bread, we can still have rice,\" Landry, said, \"but the whole grain version.\"",

    "fullText": "UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United States accused Russia on Monday of a “dangerous and inexplicable escalation” of its nearly four-year war in Ukraine at a time when the Trump administration is trying to advance negotiations toward peace.\n\nU.S. deputy ambassador to the United Nations Tammy Bruce singled out Russia’s launch of a nuclear-capable Oreshnik ballistic missile last week close to Ukraine’s border with Poland, a NATO ally.\n\nShe told an emergency meeting of the Security Council that the United States deplores “the staggering number of casualties” in the conflict and condemns Russia’s intensifying attacks on energy and other infrastructure.\n\nUkraine called for the meeting after last Thursday’s overnight Russian bombardment with hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles, including the powerful, new hypersonic Oreshnik missile, which Moscow used for only the second time in what was a clear warning to Kyiv’s NATO allies.\n\nThe large-scale attack came days after Ukraine and its allies reported major progress toward agreeing on how to defend the country from further Moscow aggression if a U.S.-led peace deal is struck.\n\nThe attack also coincided with a new chill in relations between Moscow and Washington after Russia condemned the U.S. seizure of an oil tanker in the North Atlantic. And it came as U.S. President Donald Trump signaled he is on board with a hard-hitting sanctions package meant to economically cripple Russia.\n\nMoscow has given no public signal it is willing to budge from its maximalist demands on Ukraine. And Russia's U.N. ambassador on Monday blamed the diplomatic impasse on Ukraine.\n\nEurope’s leaders condemned the attack using the Oreshnik as “escalatory and unacceptable,” and U.S. envoy Bruce was equally tough on Monday.\n\n“At a moment of tremendous potential, due only to President Trump’s unparalleled commitment to peace around the world, both sides should be seeking ways to de-escalate,” she said. “Yet Russia’s action risks expanding and intensifying the war.”\n\nBruce reminded Russia that nearly a year ago it voted in favor of a Security Council resolution calling for an end to the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n“It would be nice if Russia matched their words with deeds,” she said. “In the spirit of that resolution, Russia, Ukraine and Europe must pursue peace seriously and bring this nightmare to an end.”\n\nBut Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the Security Council that until Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy “comes to his senses and agrees to realistic conditions for negotiations, we will continue solving the problem by military means.”\n\n“He was warned long ago, with each passing day, each day which he squanders, the conditions for negotiations will only get worse for him,” Nebenzia said. “Similarly, each vile attack on Russian civilians will elicit a stiff response.”\n\nUkraine’s U.N. Ambassador Andriy Melnyk countered that Russia is more vulnerable now than at any time since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. Its economy is slowing and oil revenue is down.\n\n“Russia wants to sell to this council and the whole U.N. family the impression that it is invincible, but this is another illusion,” he told the council. “The carefully staged image of strength is nothing but smoke and mirrors, completely detached from reality.”",

    "fullText": "A Russian captain killed a crewman in an “entirely avoidable” collision with a US oil tanker in the North Sea, a court heard.\n\nCapt Vladimir Motin, 59, was on sole watch duty when his container ship collided into the Stena Immaculate, causing the death of Mark Angelo Pernia on March 10 last year.\n\nPernia had allegedly been working at the front of the Solong and died in the collision.\n\nOpening his Old Bailey trial on Tuesday, Tom Little KC, prosecuting, said the case involved the “entirely avoidable death” of the 38-year-old seaman Pernia.\n\nHe told jurors that the location of the Stena Immaculate would have been visible on the Solong’s radar display about 36 minutes before the vessels collided.\n\nMr Little said: “Despite an obvious collision course, the defendant did not deviate his vessel from its path and the impending catastrophe that lay ahead.\n\n“The defendant was responsible for navigating the ship, not only because he was the captain but because he was on sole watch duty at the time and ultimately, he did nothing, absolutely nothing, to avoid the collision.”\n\nMr Motin, from Primorsky, St Petersburg, is accused of manslaughter, Mr Little telling jurors that Pernia “would still be alive” if not for the Russian’s “grossly negligent” conduct.\n\nSolong, which was 130 metres long and weighed 7,852 gross tonnes, had departed Grangemouth in Scotland at 9.05pm on March 9 last year, bound for the port of Rotterdam.\n\nThe vessel, with a 14-strong crew, was carrying mainly alcoholic spirits and some hazardous substances, including empty but unclean sodium cyanide containers, the court was told.\n\nThe Stena Immaculate, with a crew of 23, was 183.2 metres long and was transporting more than 220,000 barrels of aviation fuel destined for the US military.\n\nIts engine was shut down on the evening of March 9. Restarting it would have taken about 30 to 45 minutes and about 35 minutes to manoeuvre away from an incoming ship, the court heard.\n\nThe two vessels crashed at about 9.47am on March 10, just over 12 hours after the Solong set off from Grangemouth.\n\nThe Solong had been travelling at just over 16 knots in the minutes before the collision and was going 15.2 knots on impact with no warning to the Stena Immaculate.\n\nPernia’s body has never been found.\n\nThe Solong was on a direct collision course for much longer than a matter of minutes, jurors were told.\n\nThe collision course was obvious when the tanker became visible to the naked eye and, before that, on computer equipment available to the defendant, Mr Little argued.\n\nMr Motin had a “constellation of information” telling him he needed to act but did the opposite and failed to avert the collision, the court heard.\n\nThere were a number of things the “highly trained” captain “could and should have done”, Mr Little said.\n\n“It is this gross breach of duty to the man he killed, and indeed to his own crew, that led inexorably to a death and to him being on trial before you at the Old Bailey,” the prosecutor said.\n\nMr Motin has denied manslaughter and the trial continues.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

Video captured by the Ohio Department of Transportation shows the flashes of light and explosions lasting about 40-seconds.\n\nFirefighters responded to the 4200 block of Fenwick Avenue for an occupied house fire. That’s when reports of a transformer explosion also came in, as well as multiple downed power lines across the road. Hundreds of Cleveland Public Power customers lost power.\n\nGun, ammo found at Strongsville High School\n\nCrews on scene Monday night said it became “critical emergency.”\n\nAs of 8:30 p.m., the house fire was under control, but Cleveland firefighters confirmed there was a gas fire at the house. Enbridge reportedly shut off the gas for the entire street.\n\nHow much daylight do we gain this month?\n\nFire companies at the scene had to go door-to-door to check electric meters for issues. Some of the electric meters were even blown off of houses, according to CDF.\n\nA FOX 8 viewer captured this video just before 7 p.m.\n\n“It sounded like fireworks down that direction, and in a matter of seconds, those fireworks got louder and louder and closer and closer,” one witness said. “Started to see the meters on some of the houses explode off. Wires started exploding, hitting my car.”\n\nAbout a thousand people lost electricity. No injuries were reported.",

    "description": "A \"nasty\" 15% sell-off could hit crowded trades this spring, says Tom Sosnoff.",
    "fullText": "The hottest AI trade on Wall Street has officially become \"boring.\"\n\n\"Nvidia would be a very boring idea ... because we all know the story,\" serial entrepreneur Tom Sosnoff told Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid.\n\nThe former founder of Thinkorswim and Tastytrade argued that despite Nvidia's technological dominance, the stock's story is too well-known and it may be priced for perfection.\n\nSosnoff isn't a tech skeptic. In fact, he's a fan of the product. He likened Nvidia's (NVDA) AI platforms to having a \"genius best friend\" with a 165 IQ available at all times.\n\nThe problem, he argued, is that Nvidia is now \"totally fully priced.\" When most analysts and retail traders are already on one side of the boat, that \"boring\" reality suggests there are very few surprise scenarios that can drive the price significantly higher from here.\n\n\"I look at Nvidia and I'm thinking to myself, how much more upside [is] in here and what kind of downside is there if this thing rolls over?\" Sosnoff said. \"It's not a function of ... Nvidia itself. It's just a function of price.\"\n\nThe warning comes at a time when market volatility is hovering at multi-year lows and stocks are sitting at record levels. In the past year, Nvidia's shares have risen roughly 40%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) recently closed at all-time highs this month.\n\nSosnoff isn't predicting a total market collapse, but he's bracing for a reality check. He anticipates a \"nasty sell-off\" in the range of 10% to 15% potentially hitting between March and May.\n\n\"The odds favor the downside in the market,\" said Sosnoff. He noted that while the equity market is partying, the bond market has remained eerily stagnant. If that volatility returns, the \"fully priced\" darlings like Nvidia are often the first to feel the gravity. Moreover, market fickleness could materialize when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's term ends in May.\n\nAnother provocative take is that Nvidia's reign as the world's most valuable company is under threat. When asked if the AI giant would still have its crown at the end of the year, Sosnoff was skeptical.\n\n\"I don't think it's going to be Nvidia,\" he said regarding the market cap race. Google (GOOG, GOOGL) has recently edged out Apple (AAPL) to become the second-most-valuable company in the world, and it's within striking distance of Nvidia as it surges past $4 trillion.",

    "description": "Winfrey appeared on 'Today' to promote her new book, 'Enough.'",
    "fullText": "Sheinelle Jones‘ second day as the fourth of Today‘s new cohost featured a very special guest.\n\nOprah Winfrey stopped by the NBC morning show to promote her new book, Enough: Your Health, Your Weight, and What It’s Like To Be Free, which she cowrote with endocrinologist and associate professor at the Yale School of Medicine Dr. Ania M. Jastreboff. While reflecting on her weight-loss journey, Winfrey shared some surprising side effects she’s experienced while taking a GLP-1 medication.\n\nJastreboff stated that the most common symptoms for people taking weight-loss medication include nausea, diarrhea, and constipation.\n\n“I never had nausea or diarrhea, but I did have the third one,” Winfrey stated. “I finally figured out, for me, what the right combination of magnesium and water is. I have to drink a lot of water. I have to have a gallon of water a day.”\n\nAccording to Winfrey, she has to finish drinking her gallon of water before 4 p.m., or else she will be up all night. While drinking lots of water makes Winfrey’s kidneys “very happy,” Jastreboff said there are other ways to “lessen nausea” while on weight-loss medication.\n\n“The most important way is working with your healthcare provider and going up very, very slowly. So, start slow, go slow. If you’re feeling nauseated, then don’t increase the dose,” she explained. “And there’s other things — not eating past the point of fullness, making sure you’re monitoring which foods could make you worse. All of these different things can lower the side effects.”\n\nWinfrey revealed that she gained 20 pounds last year after going off of her medication to test if she would retain her weight loss without the drug. “If you’re on blood pressure medication, you get your blood pressure to the level that your doctor says is healthy for you, you come off the medication, your blood pressure is gonna go up,” she stated. “The same thing is true for this. I know it ’cause I proved it.”\n\nEarlier in the episode, Winfrey said she has a newfound sense of freedom since starting a GLP-1 prescription. “The new freedom is understanding that all those years that I suffered and was on the tabloids every week and made fun of and was the butt of everybody’s jokes, and I thought it was because of my lack of willpower,” she told Jones and Jenna Bush Hager. “[I thought] ‘What is wrong with me that I can be successful in so many ways and I can’t conquer this thing?’ Now I know that it has nothing to do with willpower. It has everything to do with your biology.”\n\nWinfrey said she hopes her and Jastreboff’s new book will help change the conversation about obesity and weight loss. “Back in the day, when I first started The Oprah [Winfrey] Show, in ’86, ’87, we did our first show on alcoholism. And people in the audience were like, ‘Oh, just put the bottle down,'” she recalled. “People did not recognize — refused to recognize — that alcoholism is a disease. And so, now we’re saying the same thing about obesity.”\n\nWinfrey continued, “It’s a disease. It’s a chronic disease. You have to manage it. And even when you think you’ve gotten to your goal weight, it’s not the answer because what the medications do is manage the set point in your body.”\n\nToday With Jenna & Sheinelle, Weekdays, 10 a.m./9c, NBC\n\nRead the latest entertainment news on TV Insider.",

Phil Murphy signed legislation transferring all of New Jersey City University’s academic programs, facilities and assets to Kean University while allotting $25 million in support of the transition, among other procedural steps.\n\n“This is a pivotal moment for students across New Jersey,” said Kean University President Lamont Repollet.\n\nOfficials have set July 1 as a target date for completing the merger, which remains subject to review by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education and the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nAll New Jersey City University students would become students of Kean University. New Jersey City University’s campus in Jersey City would serve as a metropolitan campus for Kean University known as Kean Jersey City.\n\nThe governing boards at both institutions approved the merger last year and it would be among the largest-ever in New Jersey.\n\nKean University enrolls approximately 19,000 students, including students on its China satellite campus. New Jersey City University has about 5,500 students.\n\nThe planned merger is designed to help New Jersey City University stay open. The 99-year-old institution has grappled with financial problems for years.\n\nNew Jersey City University President Andrés Acebo said the merger would strengthen its role as “a vital pathway to public higher education in Hudson County and Jersey City, rooted in a deep commitment to access, opportunity, and community.”\n\nNew Jersey City University was assigned a monitor by the state in 2023 and directed to identify a potential university partner. School officials explored a possible merger with Montclair State University before announcing plans last March to proceed with Kean.\n\nMoody’s, one of the nation’s “big three” credit agencies, cited the proposed merger and other factors in upgrading New Jersey City University’s financial outlook from “stable” to “positive” last spring.\n\n“Our students and our community will have access to expanded academic offerings, enhanced resources and support services, and new community-centered opportunities, all while staying rooted in the Jersey City community that we are proud and privileged to serve,” Acebo said Monday of the planned merger.\n\nNew Jersey City University awarded 1,544 undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees at its 2025 commencement ceremony in May.",

    "description": "Officials say a mechanical issue was the problem. The FAA is investigating.",
    "fullText": "Last week a small, yellow airplane made an emergency landing at a terminal inside the Port of Tacoma, officials confirmed on Monday.\n\nA fixed-wing, single-engine plane owned by a Seattle man reportedly landed at an empty marine-cargo terminal owned by TOTE Maritime Alaska, Inc. on Wednesday, Jan. 7 around 11:50 p.m., officials told The News Tribune.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration said two people were in the plane, and there were no injuries. The FAA is still investigating, said public affairs specialist Steve Kulm.\n\nNo police report was filed, and it appears the incident was not a crash but more of a mechanical issue that forced an emergency landing, said Shelbie Boyd with the Tacoma Police Department. According to a public records request received Tuesday, the plane experienced a loss of oil pressure.\n\nAn eight-second video of the plane landing at the terminal was posted on Tacoma’s Reddit thread on Friday. The man who posted it, a retired longshoreman named Darin Moody, told The News Tribune over the phone Monday that the video was circulating in a group chat he was a part of. The video appears to be a recording of security footage the night of Jan. 7.\n\nBecause the situation involved a marine-cargo terminal, the Port of Tacoma referred The News Tribune was to the Northwest Seaport Alliance. Kate Nolan, with the Northwest Seaport Alliance, confirmed the Cessna plane made a successful emergency landing at TOTE after a mechanical issue. No cargo was impacted, she said.\n\nRepresentatives with the TOTE company could not be immediately reached for comment Monday, including to verify the security footage.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard Northwest District, which Tacoma police said might also be investigating the incident, did not have more information to share as of Monday evening. The Tacoma Fire Department did not respond to the incident, The News Tribune confirmed Tuesday morning.",

    "fullText": "If you handed Mark Cuban $100,000, he wouldn't run to Wall Street or some hot tech startup. He'd grab a shopping cart.\n\nIn a 2010 Forbes interview, the billionaire was asked what he'd do with a lump sum of $100,000. His response wasn't flashy. It wasn't cryptic. And it didn't involve crypto. It involved…toothpaste.\n\n\"First I pay off all my credit card debt and evaluate paying off any other debt I have. What I have left I put in the bank,\" he said. But he didn't stop there.\n\nThe ‘ChatGPT of Marketing' Just Opened a $0.85/Share Round — 10,000+ Investors Are Already In\n\nMissed the AI Boom's Biggest IPOs? This Platform Lets Everyday Investors Access Private Tech Early\n\nThen comes the part that sounds less like a billionaire's financial strategy and more like a Costco coupon haul: \"I try to create as much transactional value as possible from that cash. I look at my annual budgets for everything and anything, and I look to see where I can save the most money on those items. Saving 30% to 50% buying in bulk—replenishable items from toothpaste to soup, or whatever I use a lot of—is the best guaranteed return on investment you can get anywhere.\"\n\nLet's break that down. Cuban isn't saying go hoard hand sanitizer like it's 2020 again. He's saying if you already use toothpaste, toilet paper, canned soup, shampoo—things you're going to buy anyway—you might as well stock up when prices are lower. That's the ROI: buying stuff now to avoid paying more later. His version of \"investing\" isn't tied up in risk—it's about locked-in savings.\n\nLet's say you usually buy a four-pack of toilet paper for $6, but a bulk box of 30 rolls goes on sale for $20. That's about 67 cents a roll vs. $1.50 a roll. Over the year, you're not just wiping away inconvenience—you're saving real cash. Multiply that across your grocery staples and, like Cuban says, you're looking at a \"guaranteed\" ROI no stock or bond can promise.\n\nTrending: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\nAnd what about the rest of that $100,000? Don't expect a fancy ETF recommendation from Cuban.\n\n\"Whatever I have left I keep in the bank and let it earn nothing,\" he said in the interview.\n\nYes—\"let it earn nothing.\" Why? Because then it's ready. Cuban's not parking money in the bank out of laziness—he's waiting for the moment he can pounce. In his world, flexibility beats short-term yield.",

    "description": "Expect the unexpected in the stock market.",
    "fullText": "Veteran trader and Thinkorswim founder Tom Sosnoff is a contrarian by nature.\n\nAnd where markets are currently trading has set off a few internal alarm bells.\n\n\"It's not that I think we're rolling over and crashing or anything like that, but I just think the odds favor the downside in the market,\" Sosnoff told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid.\n\nSosnoff added, \"I think there's a lot of stocks that are very fairly priced, and I know there's not a lot of other things to invest in and things like that. But I will just say that I think stocks are fully priced. And I think if you do get any kind of momentum to the downside, like we saw last April — and I expect to see something like that maybe in March or April or May this year — I think you're going to get a little nasty sell off, maybe 10% to 15%.\"\n\nTo Sosnoff's point, there isn't much margin for error being priced into markets.\n\nWall Street is expecting a big year for corporate earnings based on the view that mostly everything — from the economy to AI productivity to geopolitics — goes great. This optimism has powered the S&P 500 (^GSPC) beyond 7,000 for the first time, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) knocking on the door of 50,000.\n\nS&P 500 earnings are estimated to increase by double-digit percentages in each quarter of 2026, according to FactSet data. Earnings growth is expected to be the strongest in the fourth quarter at 18.1%. For the year, earnings are being modeled to grow 15%.\n\nMeanwhile, the bottom-up strategist's price target on the S&P 500 is a lofty 8,010 — up about 18% from current levels.\n\nIn turn, the forward price-to-earnings ratio (PE) for the S&P 500 is 22 times — well above the 10-year average of 18.7 times. Stocks are almost as richly valued as when they hit a peak in early January 2022. What followed was the start of a nine-month bear market — the benchmark index plunged about 19%.\n\nThe backdrop for stocks, however, is anything but perfect.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell revealed Sunday night that the Justice Department served the central bank with grand jury subpoenas, threatening a criminal indictment related to his testimony before the US Senate. At issue: reportedly, the central bank's renovation of its Washington, D.C., headquarters and whether Powell misled Congress about the project's depth.\n\nIn a video statement, Powell described the investigation as \"unprecedented\" and questioned the motivation for the move. The administration has been vocal in its desire for lower interest rates. Powell affirmed that he carried out his duties as Fed chair \"without political fear or favor.\"",

    "description": "Joe Rogan, in a blockbuster new podcast interview with Rand Paul, took a hard look at the tactics of ICE and added the shooting of Renee Good \"looked horrific.\"",
    "fullText": "Joe Rogan said he understands both sides of the debate on illegal immigration — including those who compare President Donald Trump’s ICE raids to Adolf Hitler’s Gestapo.\n\nRogan talked about the issue on his podcast with guest Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) on Tuesday. The podcast star said he gets why conservatives believe ICE raids are necessary to “take away some of the damage” done by illegal immigration.\n\nHe then said he also sees the “point of view” of anti-ICE protesters who argue “You don’t want militarized people in the streets just roaming around, snatching up people — many of which turn out to be U.S. citizens that just don’t have their papers on them. Are we really gonna be the Gestapo? ‘Where’s your papers?’ Is that what we’ve come to?”\n\nRogan made the remark while discussing the shooting of Renee Good in Minnesota last week. He said he read the agent who shot Good had been run over by a car last year — but that he still felt it was a “terrible tragedy” that shouldn’t have happened.\n\nI’m not that guy, I don’t know what he thought, and again this is a guy who had almost been run over. But this just looked horrific to me.\n\nWhen people say it’s justifiable because the car hit him, it seemed like she was kind of turning the car away.\n\nIt seemed like she was out of her f*cking mind to begin with. That lady seemed crazy.\n\nPaul told Rogan he did not want to get “too much into the specifics” of the incident because he did not want to “pass judgement like a jury would.” The senator said he believed ICE agents have a “very difficult job,” which Rogan agreed with, but mostly avoided talking about last week’s shooting.\n\nRogan said another “problem” with ICE raids is that they are making agents look like “villains” to many citizens.\n\n“People are now looking at them like murderous military people that are on the streets of our city,” Rogan said. “And they’re masked up, which is also a problem.”\n\nHe said if you get pulled over by a cop, you are allowed to ask for their name and badge number. But “If you get arrested by an ICE agent, you get no such right. They don’t have to tell you sh*t.”\n\nAt the same time, Rogan said he understands why ICE officers would want to be anonymous — because they fear anti-ICE protesters will wreck their lives.\n\nThe post ‘Are We Really Gonna Be the Gestapo?’ Joe Rogan Takes a Critical Look at ICE Raids — Says the Shooting Of Renee Good ‘Looked Horrific’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Barbies have offered broader representations of race, body type, and careers since the first doll debuted 66 years ago in 1959.\n\nGreta Gerwig's 2023 Oscar-winning \"Barbie\" movie also sparked a renaissance of the doll-inspired Barbiecore aesthetic, which included vibrant shades of pink, chunky heels, and kitschy accessories.\n\nBarbie dolls have exhibited strong staying power amid shifting toy trends, with net sales of $5.3 billion in 2024, according to Mattel.\n\nHere's a look at how Barbie dolls have evolved through the years.\n\nBarbie made her debut with a striped swimsuit, blonde ponytail, and red lipstick. Upon her release at the 1959 American Toy Fair in New York City, Barbie was an immediate hit.\n\n\"Barbie\" star Margot Robbie channeled the look with a black-and-white striped, strapless dress at a press event for the film in 2023.\n\nBarbie got a job! Fashion designer Barbie sported a matching jacket and skirt set with a blouse and sketchbook in 1960.\n\nBarbie and Ken hit the beach (or pool) together. Ken was introduced as Barbie's fictional counterpart in 1961.\n\nThis \"Red Flare\" Barbie from 1962 features a voluminous red coat and matching hat, said to be inspired by '60s style icon Jackie Kennedy.\n\n\"Midge\" was introduced in 1963 as Barbie's best friend.

    "fullText": "Below, we look back at those we lost in 2026.\n\nAdams based the character in his beloved \"Dilbert\" comic strip on his coworkers at the telephone company he worked at in the 1980s. By the end of the decade, the character and his satirical office humor began appearing in comic strips.\n\nAt its peak, \"Dilbert\" was syndicated in over 2,000 newspapers. A cartoon series debuted in 1999 and ran for two seasons.\n\nAdams gained notoriety when he began writing blog posts praising Donald Trump during his 2016 presidential run. In 2023, \"Dilbert\" was pulled from newspapers across the US following racist comments made by Adams.\n\nAdams died on January 13 following a bout with metastatic prostate cancer.\n\nHungarian filmmaker Béla Tarr became a legend in the arthouse world for his unflinching work featuring several-minute-long takes.\n\nWith movies like \"Family Nest\" (1979) and \"The Turin Horse\" (2011), Tarr showcased his slow cinema style while focusing on marginalized characters living bleak lives. Tarr pushed the envelope with his style when he made \"Sátántangó\" in 1994, which had a run time of 450 minutes.\n\nHis work influenced several arthouse filmmakers, including Jim Jarmusch and Gus Van Sant's \"Death Trilogy\" (\"Gerry,\" \"Elephant,\" and \"Last Days\").\n\nTarr died on January 6 following a battle with a \"long and serious illness.\"\n\nWeir was one of the founding members of the Grateful Dead.\n\nThe singer-songwriter wrote and/or sang on songs like \"Sugar Magnolia,\" \"Playing in the Band,\" \"Truckin,'\" \"I Need a Miracle,\" and \"The Other One.\"\n\nAfter the Grateful Dead disbanded in 1995, Weir went on to form several other bands, including Kingfish, Bobby and the Midnites, RatDog, The Other Ones, and, alongside John Mayer, Dead & Company.\n\nIn the summer of 2025, Weir was diagnosed with cancer.",

    "fullText": "When companies file for bankruptcy, often it isn't because they're not cash flow positive.\n\nBankruptcies can happen simply because a company can't generate the cash needed to service its debt. In many cases, if you took that debt away, the business itself would actually be successful.\n\nThat's the argument FAT Brands CEO Andy Wiederhorn made on Jan. 12 at the ICR conference in Orlando.\n\n“We've been talking about restructuring this debt for 18 months to two years with our note holders,” Wiederhorn said, according to Nation's Restaurant News. “It has not been a very constructive negotiation…We’re looking at avenues to lower the debt and make it practical. I wish I could say that this would go quickly and get resolved, but it may take a couple of rounds.”\n\nThe company warned late last year that it might have to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after a key lender called its note. Wiederhorn's comments made it clear that the situation is more complicated than it appears on the surface.\n\nFAT Brands owns a number of big-name restaurant brands, including Johnny Rockets, Ponderosa Steakhouse, Great American Cookie, and the Twin Peaks restaurant concept, which is owned by a subsidiary.\n\nThe company shared the details of its latest financial problem in a 10-K filing with the SEC.\n\n“On November 25, 2025, FAT Brands Inc. received a notice of acceleration (the “Acceleration Notice”) from UMB Bank, National Association, as trustee under the Base Indenture, dated July 10, 2023 by and between the company’s subsidiary, FB Resid Holdings I, LLC FB Resid and UMB, relating to fixed rate secured notes issued by FB Resid. The Acceleration Notice stated that UMB, pursuant to Section 9.2 of the FB Resid Indenture, acting at the direction of the Controlling Class Representative under the FB Resid Indenture, accelerates and declares the outstanding principal amount of the FB Resid Notes to be immediately due and payable,” the company wrote.\n\nIn practical terms, the filing said that UMB delivered to Fat Brands a “Notice of Event of Default” with respect to the FB Resid Indenture, stating that an “Event of Default had occurred pursuant to Section 9.2 of the FB Resid Indenture. The aggregate principal amount outstanding under the FB Resid Notes is $158.9 million, or $110.0 million net of FB Resid Note,” it shared.\n\nSimilar notices were sent to four other subsidiaries of FAT Brands.\n\nFAT Brands has a complicated financial structure.\n\n\"While a trustee has declared FAT Brands’ $1.26 billion in debt immediately due, Wiederhorn stated on Tuesday that the debt is not guaranteed by the parent company as a whole. Instead, the total liability is spread across five securitization trusts, involves multiple layers of investors, and is tied to individual brands,\" NRN reported.",

    "description": "Dell has existed for 42 years, but the coming changes are the biggest transformation in company history, according to COO Jeff Clarke.",
    "fullText": "If you work at Dell, get ready for big changes in 2026.\n\nThe company is planning to roll out standardized processes across its operations and launch a single enterprise platform on May 3, Jeff Clarke, Dell's chief operating officer and vice chairman, said in a memo sent to the workforce on Tuesday, and seen by Business Insider.\n\nIn the memo, Clarke said the changes constitute the \"biggest transformation in company history.\"\n\nThe modernization push, which the company has called One Dell Way, will \"connect our data, break down silos, streamline our software applications and give us the foundation to work as one connected company,\" said Clarke.\n\nIt will replace Dell's existing sprawl of applications, servers, and databases, and deliver \"seamless data flow, fewer repetitive tasks, faster decision-making and more time for work that drives real impact,\" Clarke said.\n\nThe vice chairman, who has recently taken a more active role in Dell's day-to-day operations, said that the changes are a key enabler of Dell's modernization.\n\nFor years, the company has built multiple variations of tools used for fundamental processes, such as developing and selling, Clarke said in the memo.\n\n\"That won't cut it in an AI-driven world. We need one way —simplified, standardized, and automated — so we can be more competitive and serve our customers better,\" Clarke said.\n\nSimplifying the underlying infrastructure is a crucial part of unlocking AI's future potential: no matter how much companies spend on flashy AI tools, they won't deliver speed or scale if the data behind them remains fragmented.\n\nOne Dell Way is \"foundational to our success in an AI-driven world,\" Clarke said.\n\nA company spokesperson told Business Insider that \"One Dell Way is a transformation initiative designed to simplify processes, standardize systems, and use automation to create a more connected and efficient organization.\"\n\nRather than a gradual transition, the new operating system will kick in on a single crossover date, May 3, for Dell's PC business — known as the CSG division — as well as for finance, supply chain, marketing, sales, revenue operations, services, and HR operations, according to Clarke's memo.\n\nDell's ISG division, which handles its cloud offering, data servers, and other AI infrastructure, will follow in August, Clarke said.\n\nThe vice chairman told employees to \"be ready\" for the change.\n\n\"Training is critical,\" and should be a priority once training opens on February 3, Clarke said.\n\nBusiness Insider previously reported that Dell has been running a secretive, multi-year internal project, codenamed \"Maverick,\" for which staff had signed NDAs to work on. It was initially scheduled to launch for parts of the company in February 2026, but was pushed back to May.\n\nDell's current modernization drive comes 42 years after Michael Dell founded the company as a freshman at the University of Texas.\n\nDell has since expanded into AI and cloud infrastructure, gone private, and then returned to public markets, and pulled off the second-largest tech merger ever with its $67 billion purchase of EMC in 2016 — but, as Clarke said in the memo, the coming changes are Dell's biggest shake-up yet.\n\nRead Clarke's full memo to Dell employees here:\n\nOur industry is moving faster than ever, and we've spent the past two years modernizing how Dell works so we can move even faster—simplifying and standardizing processes, eliminating inefficiencies and improving our tools and applications. That's <One Dell Way>.\n\nNow we're taking the next major step in this journey: rolling out standardized processes and an enterprise platform that will connect our data, break down silos, streamline our software applications and give us the foundation to work as one connected company.\n\nWe'll begin operating in this new way on May 3, starting with CSG, Finance, Supply Chain, Marketing, Sales, RevOps, Services and HR operations. ISG follows in August.\n\nFor years, our strong functional orientation meant we built many variations of fundamental processes—multiple ways to develop, multiple ways to market, multiple ways to sell, multiple ways to service.\n\nThat won't cut it in an AI-driven world. We need one way—simplified, standardized and automated—so we can be more competitive and serve our customers better.\n\nThis requires a mindset shift, from thinking and operating function-first to company-first. In some cases, that may mean we may make a choice that isn't optimal for a particular function, but it speeds up decision-making or improves quality for the company as a whole. That's the trade-off, and it's the right one. We're optimizing for Dell, not for individual functions.\n\nStandardized processes and an enterprise platform mean no more workarounds, no holding onto old ways of working. Instead, we get seamless data flow, fewer repetitive tasks, faster decision-making and more time for work that drives real impact.\n\nThis is a comprehensive change, not a gradual transition. Once we start operating in the new way on May 3, we won't go back.\n\nThe degree of change will vary by team and role. Some of you will experience significant shifts in how you work day-to-day. For others, the changes will be minimal. But all of us need to understand what's happening and support each other through it.\n\nIf your work spans both CSG and ISG, you'll navigate the new processes and applications for CSG, and legacy systems for ISG until August. You'll learn \n\nLearning new systems and new ways of working isn't easy, especially when you're already moving fast. Here's my ask of you:\n\nTraining is critical. You can't operate in the new system without it, no exceptions. Training opens February 3, and you'll get an email that day with your personalized information. Please make it a priority.\n\nThis is the biggest transformation in company history. I know there will be challenges, and that's OK—we're here to support you and work through this together. Your leader will keep you updated as we move through training and launch.\n\nThis is foundational to our success in an AI-driven world, and One Dell Way is how we get there—working as one company, with one set of processes, focused on what matters most.\n\nLet's lean in, learn as we go and build a better company together.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Steven Bartlett, host of 'The Diary of a CEO' podcast, uses a 'Culture Test' that emphasizes character and values in hiring.",
    "fullText": "\"The Diary of a CEO\" host and entrepreneur Steven Bartlett swears by his scenario-based \"Culture Test\" in hiring, and says there's one question he loves, but that's rarely answered correctly.\n\nSpeaking on the \"Hot Smart Rich\" podcast, Bartlett said he uses a 35-question test rather than asking about academic grades to determine how people will act in a given situation and identify high-performing employees.\n\nThe question he loves goes like this: There's an event that's six weeks away, and an important supplier said they won't be able to get you the things you need in time. The options are: scale back the event, push back the date, or — the answer Bartlett is looking for — ask why it takes six weeks.\n\n\"It's so crazy, because about 7% of people click that button, but that is so clearly the right thing to do,\" he said.\n\nBartlett said the concept came up in his own company when an employee said he couldn't provide the animation for \"DOAC\" by Bartlett's deadline. When the employee was asked why, he cited his aging laptop.\n\n\"$2,000 fixed the problem that's now going to save me 60% of my time for years,\" Bartlett said.\n\nBartlett's point is that most people fall back on artificial constraints and traditions that keep them from pushing back. He cited innovators like fast-fashion company Zara and Bernard Sadow, a pioneer of the rolling suitcase, who challenged those conventions.\n\nBartlett said that, as a result, he prioritizes hiring and has developed a Culture Test, which he turned into a company by the same name.\n\nHe added on the podcast that he had spent \"50% of my month on hiring.\"\n\nBartlett's flagship show, which often ranks at the top of Apple's business podcasts chart, is part of his holding company, Steven.com, which he recently said raised an eight-figure investment. It encompasses businesses like Flight Story, a media and investment company that's expanded into a network of other shows.\n\nBartlett presented another Culture Test scenario on the podcast: Consider what you might do if your biggest client called on Christmas Eve, saying they were logged out of their account. Would you reply immediately, wait until the holidays are over, or send a rude response reminding them it's Christmas? He said that how people react represents the company culture.\n\nAdding some heft to Bartlett's view, research has shown that hiring people for culture fit can lead to higher performance and lower turnover.\n\nThere are potential pitfalls in prioritizing culture fit, however. Critics argue that it can lead employers to hire people who look like or share the same characteristics as existing staff, potentially at the expense of diversity. Research has shown that diverse teams outperform more homogeneous ones.",

    "fullText": "Since going Hollywood in the early 2000s after a sensational pro wrestling career at the WWE, Johnson has gradually built up his box office tally. But the ticket sales got as big as his biceps when he joined the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise with 2011's \"Fast Five.\"\n\nAlong with helping \"Fast\" entries like 2015's \"Furious 7\" and 2017's \"The Fate of the Furious\" each earn over $1 billion at the worldwide box office, he's also scored other big hits like the \"Moana\" and \"Jumanji\" franchises.\n\nAs Captain America, Evans is attached to some of the biggest box office earners of all time, including 2019's \"Avengers: Endgame,\" which is the second-highest-grossing movie of all time at the worldwide box office with over $2.7 billion.\n\nSince then, he's shown up in box office hits like \"Free Guy\" (just a quick cameo, but it still counts) and 2024's \"Deadpool & Wolverine.\"\n\nExpect him to rise up this list with him reprising his role as Captain America in \"Avengers: Doomsday\" coming out at the end of the year.\n\nAs the star in all 10 movies in the \"Fast\" franchise, Vin Diesel is a major part of its over $7 billion take.\n\nDiesel has also scored big as the voice of Groot in the \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" franchise.\n\nAs the face of the Thor franchise, Hemsworth has helped it earn close to $3 billion at the worldwide box office. As a member of \"The Avengers\" franchise, he's also been a part of the close to $8 billion those movies have grossed.\n\nMost recently, he starred in the hit \"Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga.\" He will also be \"Avengers: Doomsday.\"\n\nRegarded as one of the last true movie stars, Cruise was topping box office charts long before most on this list had their first screen credit.\n\nNow in his 60s, Cruise is proving he's still got it as the latest (and perhaps final) \"Mission: Impossible\" movie, \"The Final Reckoning,\" is going strong in theaters, earning half a billion dollars worldwide. That adds to its already impressive tally of close to $5 billion for the eight-movie franchise.\n\nThere's also talk of a third \"Top Gun\" movie after the franchise was revived in 2020 with \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" which brought in $1.4 billion.\n\nWho knew the jokester from \"Parks and Recreation\" would become such a huge box office draw?\n\nFrom playing Star-Lord in the \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" movies (and several other Marvel releases), a lovable Lego figure in the \"The Lego Movie\" franchise, the hero in the \"Jurassic World\" movies, and the voice of Mario in \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie,\" Pratt's hard work has paid off.\n\nBelieve it or not, there was a time when Hollywood wanted nothing to do with Robert Downey Jr.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Downey Jr.'s years of drug use and brushes with the law caught up with him. After spending a year at a court-ordered drug-treatment facility, he was broke and virtually unhireable.\n\nThen he got the offer that led to his comeback: the titular role in 2008's \"Iron Man.\"\n\nWith that, Downey Jr. became the face of the lucrative Marvel Cinematic Universe, which has grossed over $31 billion worldwide to date.\n\nAfter ending his run as Iron Man with 2019's \"Avengers: Endgame,\" the second-highest-grossing movie of all time, he's returning to the MCU as the villain Doctor Doom in \"Avengers: Doomsday.\"\n\nIf there has ever been a blueprint for success in the modern-day movie business, it would be Sam Jackson's filmography.\n\nFrom \"Star Wars\" to the MCU to Pixar's hit \"The Incredibles,\" the actor has been a staple of box-office sensations for decades — and let's not forget all the memorable roles he's played in movies from Spike Lee and Quentin Tarantino.\n\nThis is why he was No. 1 on this list for so many years.\n\nSince showing up as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow in 2010's \"Iron Man 2,\" Johansson has upped her box office game.\n\nAlong with being a fixture in the MCU as a member of The Avengers, she also found big box office dollars starring in movies like \"The Jungle Book\" and \"Sing.\"\n\nAs the face of the latest hit movie in the \"Jurassic Park\" franchise, \"Jurassic World Rebirth,\" which took in close to $870 million at the worldwide box office, Johansson was tops on this list.\n\nThis recent Oscar winner has been on a box office hot streak for years.\n\nBetween playing Uhura in the \"Star Trek\" franchise, Gamora in the \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" movies, and Neytiri in the epic \"Avatar\" films, Saldaña's role choices have been impeccable.\n\nReturning as Neytiri in James Cameron's 2025 hit \"Avatar: Fire & Ash,\" which has scored over $1 billion at the global box office, has placed her as the current highest-grossing actor.",

    "description": "Mark Zandi told Business Insider that the idea to cap credit card interest would hurt borrowers, while Trump's mortgage plan could raise home prices.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has floated some big ideas to make life more affordable for everyday Americans in the last week, but one veteran economist has his doubts that they'll make much of a difference.\n\nIn fact, he sees the plans to lower mortgage rates and cap credit card interest as potentially doing more harm than good.\n\nTrump revealed plans to bring down mortgage rates and make credit card debt cheaper. For mortgages, he said he had directed \"representatives\" to buy $200 billion of mortgage bonds, while his plan for credit cards entails capping interest at 10% for a year.\n\nThe president framed both plans as being in the interest of US consumers, but Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi thinks that both moves could end up having the opposite effect.\n\nZandi spent much of 2025 sounding the alarm over Trump's policies, which he said could push the US toward a recession, and he's remained pessimistic so far in 2026.\n\nZandi posted on X that the news of Trump's housing market plan has already pushed fixed mortgages down by 10 to 20 basis points. While that sounds like good news for borrowers and is likely exactly what Trump wants to see, the sudden dip in rates could ultimately drive home prices up.\n\n\"Unfortunately, this will do little to make homebuying more affordable, as while the lower rates will support housing demand, given the severe housing shortage, it will also result in higher house prices, all else equal,\" he said.\n\nZandi also warned that Trump's intention to use Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to pile up mortgage bonds could pose further complications. He said it would effectively weaken a safeguard imposed on the two mortgage giants following the 2008 housing market crash that was meant to keep them from posing a systemic risk to the economy.\n\nZandi also said he had issues with Trump's credit card idea.\n\nHe told Business Insider that while he sees little chance that Trump's plan for a cap on credit card interest rates would clear legal hurdles, the move would ultimately curtail the availability of credit for borrowers who rely on it.\n\n\"Only consumers with high credit scores would avoid having their credit lines reduced or eliminated altogether,\" he said. \"That's because banks and other credit card lenders simply won't be able to profitably extend credit cards at a 10% rate to many Americans.\"\n\nZandi predicted that higher-income households would benefit from lower rates middle and lower income people would be shut out.\n\nAnalysts at UBS echoed Zandi's perspective on credit card rate caps, arguing that caps on credit card interest could harm not just lower-income consumers but the broader economy, as it would mean less spending. Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman responded with a similar argument, stating that he thinks such a move would be a mistake.",

    "fullText": "Soaring oil prices. Hot inflation. Turmoil in markets.\n\nThat was a dire combination the US economy saw in the 1970s, but analysts say that the risks of another oil price shock — a situation where oil prices abruptly surge and set off a domino effect of negative consequences in markets and the economy —are on the rise as geopolitical conflict escalates.\n\nOil prices spiked in recent weeks as the US conducted its raid on Venezuela and threatened to take military action in Iran — two of the world's largest crude producers.\n\nMarch contracts for Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose 10% in the last week, and jumped by as much as 3% to trade above $65 a barrel on Tuesday. It's the highest price for Brent since November.\n\nShould Brent oil hit $80 a barrel, that would probably constitute an oil price shock, according to José Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers.\n\nIn that scenario, Torres said he believes bonds and stocks would sell off in tandem, as higher energy prices could stoke inflation, which could weigh on economic growth. Higher inflation could also mean the Fed has less room to cut interest rates down the line, a major catalyst that has pushed risk assets higher in the past year.\n\n\"Definitely there's risk for an oil price shock, especially with stocks coming up for three really robust years,\" Torres told Business Insider, referring to the back-to-back years of double-digit gains for the S&P 500.\n\nMatt Gertken, the chief geopolitical strategist at BCA Research, said that recent tensions in Iran have raised the odds of a \"massive global oil supply shock\" to around 40%. Should Iran's regime fall and conflict in the region increase, that could result in a \"significant loss\" in oil production around the region, he wrote in a note to clients this week.\n\n\"Global and US equities are exposed to a correction in the near term given overvalued and overbought conditions and escalating geopolitical risk at the moment,\" Gertken added.\n\nAnalysts at Deutsche Bank also flagged the risk of the market experiencing an oil shock this year.\n\n\"A positive supply shock to oil prices would materially impact inflation expectations and inflation risks,\" the bank wrote in a recent client note, calling the scenario a key risk to their economic outlook.\n\nJeff Currie, a longtime commodities strategist and the chief strategy officer of energy pathways at Carlyle, added that he believes there could be further upside risk to oil prices. He pointed to factors such as high demand for crude and \"quite high\" geopolitical risk, which could make oil more expensive.\n\n\"The situation in Venezuela, the impact on geopolitical risk is very large,\" Currie told CNBC last week. \"For oil importers, whether you're China, India, or Europe, the world got a lot more dangerous.\"",

    "fullText": "The showdown between Elon Musk and Sam Altman is headed to court — and it's set to be a long one.\n\nOakland federal judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers on Tuesday set a new trial date for Musk's legal dispute with OpenAI — one week after saying the Tesla CEO had enough evidence for the case to be decided by a jury.\n\nJury selection is now scheduled to start on Monday, April 27. The trial will start the next day and could last four weeks, through May 22, the court docket showed. The trial had previously been scheduled for March 30.\n\nIt's the latest development in a clash of the tech titans that kicked off last year when Musk sued Altman over the ChatGPT maker's partnership with Microsoft and shift toward a for-profit model. Musk, a founder and early supporter of OpenAI, claims he contributed $38 million to OpenAI over the years under the premise that it would maintain its original altruistic, nonprofit roots.\n\nOpenAI has countered that Musk knew about its pivot toward a for-profit as early as 2018 and says its nonprofit arm still plays a central role in its governance. The company has blasted the lawsuit as baseless and has characterized it as part of a larger harassment campaign by Musk.\n\nLast week, Judge Gonzalez Rogers rejected arguments by Altman's lawyers to block the case from proceeding to trial, saying Musk had sufficient evidence to justify a jury trial.\n\n\"I think there's plenty of evidence,\" the judge said at a hearing on January 7. \"It's circumstantial, but that's how these things work.\"\n\nHundreds of exhibits were unsealed in the case last week, including a 2023 text that revealed tension in the two tech titans' relationship before Musk filed his suit.\n\n\"I don't think openai would have happened without you — and it really fucking hurts when you publicly attack openai,\" Altman texted Musk in 2023.\n\nMusk responded: \"I hear you and it is certainly not my intention to be hurtful, for which I apologize, but the fate of civilization is at stake.\"",

    "description": "With US federal EV incentives gone, Tesla gets back to dominating the US market. It's all about volume and EV manufacturing scale.",
    "fullText": "Federal incentives for electric vehicles disappeared at the end of the third quarter, leaving the US market to survive on its own merits.\n\nSo, how did companies perform in this new, realistic environment?\n\nCox Automotive, an industry data provider, has just released EV sales estimates for the fourth quarter on Tuesday, and the numbers reveal which companies thrive and which struggle without government assistance.\n\nTesla once again dominates the EV market in the US. Its market share surged to 59% in Q4, up from 41% in the previous quarter, Cox data shows.\n\nOne major reason is that EV companies in the US now have to make the numbers work without government help. A significant part of the equation is volume.\n\nDespite a decline in sales recently, Tesla still sold 138,000 EVs in the US during the fourth quarter. That type of volume helps the company maintain relatively low prices while still making money.\n\nMost rivals don't have that volume, and their EV manufacturing operations just aren't as efficient as Tesla's because they still make other types of cars, which have way more parts than EVs. This can make them more expensive to manufacture and can lead to big losses.\n\n\"In the volume-driven business of automotive manufacturing, low volume is the enemy; EV profitability remains a distant dream for nearly every automaker,\" Cox warned last year as federal incentives ended.\n\nFord's EV market share was measly 6% in the fourth quarter, while Rivian's stood at just 4%.\n\nGeneral Motors is performing somewhat better, with a market share of over 10%. Even here, the math just doesn't add up. General Motors took $6 billion in fourth-quarter charges tied to scaling back EV plans in the US.\n\nIn December, Ford abandoned large EVs because it couldn't make a profit on them. The company took a $20 billion write-down on its failing EV business. Rivian still loses a lot of money, although its cheaper R2 EV might improve things later this year.\n\nIn July, Mercedes stopped taking EV orders in the US. Stellantis recently shelved some of its EV plans, along with Porsche and Honda. Even Ferrari, which has juicy profit margins, dialed down its EV plans.\n\nIf EV operations can't reach high-volume scale, they risk constantly losing money. At some point, they have to stop the bleeding. When incentives ended in the US, many players decided to give up.\n\nTesla remains the exception in the US. It's proving that, in this industry, volume equals survival.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

Users grant the agentic AI tool access to specific files on their computer and prompt it to complete tasks.\n\nBoris Cherny, head of Claude Code, said that Anthropic's AI coded \"pretty much all\" of Cowork.\n\n\"@claudeai wrote Cowork,\" Product Manager Felix Rieseberg wrote on X. \"Us humans meet in-person to discuss foundational architectural and product decisions, but all of us devs manage anywhere between 3 to 8 Claude instances implementing features, fixing bugs, or researching potential solutions.\"\n\nAs a result, Rieseberg said the first edition of Cowork came together quickly.\n\n\"This is the product that my team has built here, we sprinted at this for the last week and a half,\" he said during a livestream with Dan Shipper.\n\nOver the holidays, Rieseberg said that Anthropic saw its customers using Claude for an increasing number of non-coding-related tasks.\n\n\"This sort of like the research preview, very early Alpha, a lot of rough edges, as you've already seen, right?\" he said.\n\nCowork is initially available to Claude Max subscribers on the Mac app.\n\nThe launch has made a splash in the tech world, with many online users praising the product and its accessibility.\n\n\"I think that's a really smart product,\" Datasette co-creator Simon Willison wrote in a blog about his experience. \"Claude Code has an enormous amount of value that hasn't yet been unlocked for a general audience, and this seems like a pragmatic approach.\"\n\n\"This is big,\" Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian wrote on X.\n\nBecause granting an AI agent access and the ability to take action on specific computer files comes with risk, Anthropic cautions that Cowork users should be careful.\n\n\"By default, the main thing to know is that Claude can take potentially destructive actions (such as deleting local files) if it's instructed to,\" the company said. \"Since there's always some chance that Claude might misinterpret your instructions, you should give Claude very clear guidance around things like this. \"\n\nAI companies wasted no time in launching new offerings and partnerships to kick off the new year.\n\nOn Sunday, Anthropic announced Claude for Healthcare, a major addition to its healthcare and life sciences offerings.

While he did not name OpenAI or CEO Sam Altman directly, he made some thinly veiled criticisms of his former company throughout the event.\n\n\"I think because we focus on enterprise, I think we have a better business model,\" Amodei said at The New York Times' Dealbook Summit. \"I think we have better margins.

    "description": "Delta's big order for Boeing 787 Dreamliners underlines its strategy to compete with rivals American and United for premium long-haul travelers.",
    "fullText": "Delta Air Lines is entering its Dreamliner era.\n\nIts order of up to 60 Boeing 787-10 planes reinforces Delta's broader strategy of competing aggressively for premium long-haul travelers — a segment that has made the transatlantic market increasingly lucrative.\n\nThe new planes for long-haul routes will add pressure on US rivals American and United, which are also competing for the same international travelers, especially those in premium cabins that generate the most profit for airlines, including Delta.\n\nDelta is hoping for a bigger piece of that pie.\n\nIt said the new 787 cabins will feature its signature Delta One business class alongside premium economy and standard coach. United has been particularly aggressive with niche transatlantic routes, while American has rolled out a new business-class product on its Dreamliners.\n\nDelta's new jets won't arrive until the next decade. Until then, Delta will continue flying its aging 767s, which the Dreamliners will eventually replace.\n\nDelta President Glen Hauenstein said in the airline's earnings call on Tuesday that the 787 is a \"financially great airplane\" that offers enhanced cargo capacity, improved fuel efficiency, and ample space for those all-important premium cabins.\n\nMeanwhile, Hauenstein said the airline would grow capacity by 3% this year, with new seat growth concentrated in premium cabins.\n\nDelta didn't disclose how much it was paying for the new planes.\n\nIt's the airline's first direct order of the popular jet, which has garnered more than 2,000 global orders. It represents a shift in its long-haul fleet strategy. Delta bought 30 and has options for 30 more.\n\nDelta's purchase of Boeing 787s is significant for an airline that has long been dominated by Airbus on the widebody side.\n\nThe airline inherited a 787 order through its merger with Northwest Airlines back in 2008, but canceled it in 2016, citing delays, quality issues, and a preference for Airbus.\n\nIt opted for Airbus A330neo and A350-900 as its next-generation long-haul workhorses, and it expects to receive the larger A350-1000 later this year.\n\nThe addition of the 787‑10 diversifies and further modernizes the fleet. The variant ordered is the largest of the Dreamliner family, seating up to 336 passengers, but has the shortest range at roughly 7,300 miles.\n\nStill, it outpaces the aging Boeing 767s that Hauenstein said the Dreamliner is set to replace, meaning it can carry more passengers more efficiently on both existing and new long-haul routes.\n\nDelta's 767s primarily fly to Europe and South America, where the airline said the 787 would be an \"ideal addition.\"\n\nThe order is a notable boost in confidence for Boeing, which has faced labor strikes, a change in leadership, and significant quality control issues for years — including on the 787 — but is gradually rebuilding trust from customers, investors, and regulators.\n\nThe 787 deal comes alongside Delta's better-than-expected earnings report for the fourth quarter and full-year 2025.\n\nIts net income was about $5 billion, largely driven by continued strong premium and corporate demand, though main‑cabin ticket revenue fell about 7% year-over-year.\n\nThe airline previously said the government shutdown shaved roughly $200 million off its pre-tax profit after regulators forced airlines to reduce flying by 10% to alleviate congestion and ensure safety.\n\nDelta's stock slipped after its earnings report, but it has still gained about 6% over the past year.",

That's a streaming record for an NFL game, and it's more than some other games got last weekend on conventional TV.\n\nAnd that tells you just how far sports and streaming have come.\n\nFlash back to 2013, for instance, and the idea of whether the \"internet\" — a catch-all term that included everything needed to get streaming video onto your screen, from web servers to fiber-optic lines to the router in your house — could support a big NFL game watched by many millions of people was an open question. \"Why Web TV Skeptic Mark Cuban Thinks Google Can Make the NFL Work on the Web,\" was an ungainly headline I tapped out at the time.\n\nBack then, the NFL and other sports giants were routinely streaming big events like the Super Bowl and World Cup — but only as a sort of secondary outlet for weirdos who didn't have traditional TV. And anyone who did stream sports had to expect to run into problems, like ESPN did when it streamed a World Cup game in 2014.\n\nA year later, the NFL put on a streaming-only game for the first time — but made sure it was a relatively niche one, and made sure that people knew it was an experiment.\n\nCut to today, and streaming is just a way we watch some football games now. Amazon pays a gazillion dollars a year to show one game a week during the regular season; Netflix has paid up to show a couple games on Christmas Day. A new deal the NFL struck with Disney last year will give the league the opportunity to sell even more games to digital players.\n\nAnd two years ago, the league passed another new threshold by moving one of its most valuable assets — a playoff game — to Comcast's Peacock streamer, where it was only available to paid subscribers. That one generated a ton of complaints from people who said they didn't want to pay another service to watch an NFL game — along with millions of sign-ups for Peacock, which showed they would.\n\nThe NFL is not ditching TV for streaming anytime soon. For many people, watching NFL games is the main reason to watch TV, and that gives the league a ton of leverage to extract ever-increasing fees from the likes of NBC and CBS. So they will almost certainly keep the majority of their games on old-time TV for the foreseeable future. But they're going to sell them to streaming platforms too — because they'll pay up to get them, and you'll pay, too.",

    "description": "Ford, seeking to fill 5,000 open positions at its dealerships, is teaming with Carhartt in an effort to boost the auto technician pipeline.",
    "fullText": "America is running low on mechanics, electricians, and plumbers.\n\nFord thinks it can help solve the problem by getting younger workers under the hood of its new pickup trucks, enticing them with free Carhartt gear and tools.\n\nThe automaker and 137-year-old workwear brand told Business Insider they're launching a multi-year partnership to address what both call a looming workforce crisis.\n\nThe partnership aims to train thousands of blue collar workers, a bet that the two Detroit-based brands can reinvigorate America's manual labor pipeline.\n\nThe partnership includes three main components: opening a ToolBank USA location in Detroit that will lend 25,000 tools annually to workers and volunteers, outfitting Ford's auto tech scholars with free Carhartt workwear, and launching a co-branded products for the public.\n\nFord is also donating an F-150 to ToolBank to extend the program's mobile reach. The two companies declined to disclose the financial terms.\n\nThe partnership comes as Ford CEO Jim Farley has warned that America will face a critical shortage of skilled tradespeople within five to ten years. The company calls these workers the backbone of the \"essential economy.\"\n\nFor Ford, the deficit is top of mind, as the company needs thousands of auto technicians to staff its dealership service bays. Right now, the company says it has 5,000 open positions at its dealerships, including six-figure technician jobs.\n\n\"The problems with the essential economy are problems for all of us,\" Farley said in September at Ford's inaugural workforce development summit, which convened industry leaders and policymakers to address the trades pipeline crisis. \"We stopped investing in the trades. If Henry Ford saw what has become of us, I think he'd be kind of mad.\"\n\nIn a phone interview with Business Insider, Mary Culler, the president of Ford Philanthropy, said part of Ford's mechanic pipeline issue is a perception problem.\n\nFord's current vehicle lineup includes advanced driver-assist systems like backup cameras, lane monitors, and autonomous features — making today's auto repair roles far more technical than traditional mechanic jobs.\n\n\"People we talk to tell us, 'I didn't realize it wasn't the greasy job I expected,'\" Culler said. \"People don't understand that it's a very high-tech job, it's a very computer-intensive job.\"\n\nFord Philanthropy has been offering $5,000 scholarships to trade- school-level technicians through TechForce Foundation, a third-party nonprofit that provides scholarships for skilled trades education. Now, participants will also receive head-to-toe Carhartt gear, including pants, shirts, and vests.\n\nStudent applicants must prove they're studying the auto technology industries to be eligible.\n\n\"Some of this work is put in the philanthropic realm,\" Culler added. \"But this is a business imperative for the future of the economy and our country. We really need to close this gap on these skill trades.\"\n\nSo far, the program hasn't yet kept pace with Ford's needs. The company has trained 1,400 technicians through TechForce since 2018 — filling less than a third of its current 5,000 open positions in seven years.\n\nBut recent jobs numbers show there is growing interest in the sector, according to LinkedIn data released last year. Half way through the year, many of the fastest-growing job titles for young workers were blue-collar, like construction workers, electricians, and mining workers.\n\nFor mechanics, cost can be another barrier, as mechanics typically need to buy or rent their own thousand-dollar toolkits.\n\nCuller said Ford provides wraparound support including tool kits and transportation to training facilities. The automaker is also working to expand participants' sense of career possibilities beyond traditional dealership roles.\n\n\"We've taken some of the scholars to F1 and Nascar races to show them that it might not be a dealership where they end up working,\" Culler said. \"You could work for a race team.\"\n\nFor Carhartt, the partnership serves dual purposes: recruiting workers for its Kentucky and Tennessee manufacturing facilities, and cultivating what it hopes could be lifetime customers. Someone who starts wearing Carhartt gear at age 20 as a Ford tech scholar could be a customer for the next 40 years.\n\nCarhartt doesn't require four-year degrees at its plants and has partnered with organizations like the National Center for Construction and Engineering Research to connect high schoolers with trades careers.\n\n\"To me, it's a bigger calling to amplify people who wear Carhartt,\" Linda Hubbard, CEO of Carhartt, told Business Insider. \"You might start out as a laborer in the trades, but you could end up owning your own business. I see a lot of these folks working their way up from the field into management into CEO positions.\"\n\nHubbard said she wants Carhartt outfitting those workers throughout their careers, from first day at the repair shop, to their last day running their own companies. Ford, meanwhile, hopes those same workers choose its trucks as their daily drivers for decades.\n\nThe commercial partnership will extend to consumer products too.\n\nCarhartt will launch Ford co-branded apparel, while Ford will unveil a Super Duty Carhartt edition truck. Both arrive in the back half of 2026 — the companies declined to share pricing or additional product details.\n\nBoth brands are betting their Detroit heritage and cultural cachet can make trades careers more appealing to younger workers.\n\n\"We're raising the perception and elevating the importance of these jobs,\" Culler said. \"But there's a real gap. We know there's a real crisis.\n\n\"Carhartt is super cool, we think Ford is super cool. Hopefully we can get the younger generation to recognize this is a real opportunity.\"",

    "fullText": "Some successful entrepreneurs sitting atop billion-dollar businesses say they may look rich on paper, but take a peek into their bank accounts, and they’re actually cash poor. Social media mogul Jimmy Donaldson, known to his 460 million YouTube followers as MrBeast, claims he’s just as broke as everyone else despite running a $5 billion entertainment empire.\n\n“I’m borrowing money. That’s how little money I have,” Donaldson told the Wall Street Journal earlier this month. “Technically, everyone watching this video has more money than me in their bank account if you subtract the equity value of my company, which doesn’t buy me McDonald’s in the morning.”\n\nThe 27-year-old entrepreneur has said that he keeps less than $1 million for himself, despite being a billionaire and owning more than half of his $5 billion company Beast Industries. Aside from his nine-figure Amazon deal and popular YouTube channel with 107 billion lifetime views, Donaldson hit the ultra-rich club—at least on paper—from a slew of successful businesses. He’s launched ventures including multimillion-dollar chocolate brand Feastables; Lunchly, a Lunchables-esque packaged food product; MrBeast Burger, a virtual restaurant that only allows for pickup and drop-off; and production company MrBeast LLC, which helps manufacture his viral videos.\n\nThrough his assets, Donaldson is projected to be worth at least $2.6 billion—although he emphasized it’s not a fat wad of cash burning a hole in his pocket. Forbes has also estimated that his annual earnings reached $85 million between April 2024 and April 2025, a far cry from the typical American salary of $62,088 a year. However, that doesn’t mean he’s splurging on luxuries and only flying private. Donaldson claimed he’s actually in the red.\n\n“It’s funny talking about my personal finances, because no one ever believes anything I say,” Donaldson explained. “They’re like, ‘You’re a billionaire!’ I’m like, ‘That’s net worth.’ I have negative money right now.”\n\n“I wake up, I just work…I’m just so busy working I don’t really think about my personal bank account,” Donaldson continued. “I’m just laser-focused on making the greatest videos as possible, and building the business as big as possible.”\n\nDonaldson rakes in eight-figure earnings and runs a $5 billion business, yet still claims to be broke. So where is all of his money going? Right back into his business ventures, the YouTube star says.\n\n“I personally have very little money because I reinvest everything (I think this year we’ll spend around a quarter of a billion on content). Ironically I’m actually borrowing $ from my mom to pay for my upcoming wedding,” Donaldson wrote on X in response to a post heralding him as the only billionaire under 30 who didn’t inherit their wealth.",

    "description": "Just like your tools, you could be getting more out of your trusty tool box.",
    "fullText": "Every self-respecting DIYer eventually buys a tool box—a sturdy place to store, organize, and protect your valuable tools. A quality metal tool box instantly ups your home maintenance and repair game—suddenly, you no longer have to spend twenty minutes rooting around for that pair of pliers or that box of random screws, because everything is in its place. And that place can often roll around and follow you to wherever you need to work.\n\nTool boxes are terrific, but that doesn’t mean they can’t be improved and augmented. Whether your tool box is a small, efficient unit or a behemoth with deep drawers and pull-out trays, you could be getting more out of it with a few simple additions. If you’re looking to squeeze a little more juice out of your tool box set-up, here are the tool box accessories you should be considering.\n\nI used to keep all the spray cans in my life—the lubricants, adhesives, and paints—on a little shelf in my work room, and they kept being knocked off onto the floor. And, inevitably, I would already be knee-deep in a project when I realized I needed one of them, and I would have to troop back to my tool closet to grab them. Instead of doing that, invest in a spray can caddy like these. They slap onto the side of your metal tool box and hold all your cans of paint or WD-40 so they’re always at hand and never lost.\n\nYou often need more than one drill, driver, or blower for a job, and having them scattered all over the work site is never ideal. This magnetic power tool holder slaps onto the side of your tool box and makes it easy to slot in up to three tools for easy access. This also keeps those bulky tools out of the tool box itself, freeing up space for more tools while ensuring that your power tools are always in the same spot when you need them.\n\nWe all know what happens to wrenches and pliers in your standard tool box: They get shoved into a drawer and jumbled up, and you spend more time picking through them trying to find the size you need than you do actually using them. A magnetic organizer like this one solves that problem, at least for your wrenches, keeping them easily accessible and organized. Interior organizers like this also make sense, and can accommodate pliers as well as wrenches, keeping things tidy in your tool box’s drawers and saving you a little time whenever you grab one—time that adds up over the course of a project.\n\nNothing is more useful on a tool box than accessories that let you temporarily store stuff. A folding shelf like this one designed for Milwaukee’s popular Packout Tool Box is incredibly useful when you need to have hand tools or fasteners in reach. If you can’t find a shelf designed for your specific tool box, there are magnetic kits like this that will work with any metal tool box, giving you some quick storage when you need it. One genius thing included in that kit is the towel holder—the simple convenience of being able to grab a paper towel as needed is worth every penny. You can also find magnetic towel holders on their own if that’s the only thing your tool box lacks.\n\nCordless power tools may have mostly freed us from the outlet—but not every tool can (or should) be cordless, and sometimes you need a handy power source. Adding a magnetic power strip to the exterior or interior of your tool box means you can plug in that legacy corded tool, charge up batteries, or plug in anything else you might need, from lights to your dying phone.\n\nYou probably have a magnetic tool holder in your workshop or tool closet already, so why not add one to your tool box? Aside from giving you more storage options, a magnetic strip lets you slap your tools into place as you need them, without losing them in the depths of a drawer or leaving them behind when you drop them on the floor and move away as you work.\n\nHonestly, cup holders should be built into everything. Having a beverage at hand while you work—whether it’s water to hydrate, coffee to wake and warm up, or a beer to settle your nerves after discovering yet another disaster brewing in your house, a simple magnetic cup holder for your tool box just makes every DIY project a little nicer.",

But turning notifications off entirely for a given app potentially means missing important messages. That's where the free Android app DoNotNotify comes in—with it you can set up custom filters for notifications.\n\nMaybe you're in a group chat that is, for the most part, useful, but includes one person who talks too much.

Launch it and you'll need to give it permissions to access your notifications. Once you do, it will start collecting a log of notifications. You can tap any of these notifications in order to set up a rule.\n\nThe first thing you need to decide is whether you want to create a blacklist or a whitelist. You can add filters for the title of the notification (the bolded part at the top of the notification) or the text (which is the excerpt below the title).\n\nThe whitelist feature is great when you only want certain notifications from your apps. For example: Maybe your banking app sends out notifications about your credit score, which you want to see, but also promotions for other services, which you don't. You could whitelist the words \"credit score.\" The same goes for news applications—maybe you only want to see headlines from a particular app when the headline mentions a certain country or public figure.\n\nBlacklists, meanwhile, allow you to do the opposite. The group text example I gave earlier is an example of this. You could also use blacklists to prevent certain public figures or topics from showing up in notifications from news applications.\n\nIt's worth noting that the application needs access to your notifications in order to filter them, meaning it could potentially gather a lot of information about you—concerns were raised about this on Hacker News. On the other hand, the app's privacy policy is quite robust, claiming not to collect any information and not to work with any third parties.\n\nI don't think this is the kind of application every person is going to want—it's for the obsessive. If that's you, though, and you get annoyed by notifications often, you should give this a try.",

    "title": "How Your Child's Google Account Changes When They Turn 13",
    "description": "They can take on a lot more responsibility, if they choose to.",
    "fullText": "The internet is a wild place, and not particularly kid-friendly. Unfortunately, it's highly impractical to keep your kids entirely off the web. That's where family accounts come in handy: Parents can set their kids up with supervised accounts, giving them access to essential apps and services, without allowing unfettered access to the entire net. It's often imperfect, and kids find workarounds for the guardrails, but still; it's better than nothing.\n\nEvery company that offers a family account handles things differently. Meta, for example, continues to update their policies in the wake of criticism surrounding how addictive and harmful their apps can be for children. These days, teens have to deal with a number of limitations they didn't previously have: While users 16 and older can remove these limitations if they wish, those under 16 need a parent's consent to do so. That means things like screen time, going live on Instagram, and DMs are all blocked and controlled by the parent for users 15 and under.\n\nIf you're the administrator of a Google Family Account, you might assume you have a similar level of control over your kids' Google accounts. Perhaps you imagine it's like Meta: When they're old enough, maybe something like 16, they can decide for themselves what level of access they have on their account, but until then, you'd have the final say. As it turns out, that's not the case. In fact, you really only have that control until your kid turns 13.\n\nI first came across this issue from this LinkedIn post from user Melissa McKay. McKay, frustrated, shared how she received an email from Google, alerting her that her youngest child will soon have the option to remove supervision on their Google Account once they turn 13. According to the attached screenshots, the email says that once the child turns 13, they'll be able to access more Google apps and services, and customize their Google Account to make it their own. McKay summed up her discontent with the following: \"Call it what it is. Grooming for engagement. Grooming for data. Grooming minors for profit.\"\n\nThe post currently has over 6,400 reactions on LinkedIn, which is relatively viral for the platform. Since I don't have kids, this is the first I'm hearing about these rules. But a quick search pulls up Google's official support doc on the subject. Indeed, when a child turns 13 (or an applicable age due to the law of the country or region) they are given the choice to either continue on with parental supervision, or manage their own Google Account.\n\nHere's what that means for your child:\n\nThey'll no longer have access to YouTube Kids, but will have access to general YouTube. Google will also disable supervised YouTube experiences.\n\nThey'll be able to add payment cards to Google Wallet or Google Pay, and can remove cards from their phone or watch, as well.\n\nThey'll be able to use these cards for tap to pay, in-app payments, website payments via Google Pay, autofill, as well as various payments across Google services, like the Play Store and YouTube.\n\nAnd here's what that means for you, as their parent:\n\nYou can no longer set up supervision features like downtime, app blocking, or mandatory location sharing. (Your child can choose to share their location, if they want to.)\n\nYou can no longer see your child's transactions or get notifications when they make new purchases.\n\nYou can't add or remove payment cards for your kid.\n\nYou can't block their access to Wallet passes.\n\nOf course, these changes are contingent on your child's decision to remove the supervision. They can choose to keep it on, and, as such, you can continue to monitor and administer your kid's account. However, I can imagine many 13 year olds will choose to remove supervision, unless they're particularly agreeable. As such, you effectively lose control when your child does turn 13.\n\nInterestingly, Google says that once a child removes supervision without your permission, their device is locked \"temporarily.\" It's not clear whether this means that the parent device needs to unlock the device, or if this just a cool down period, and the device will unlock on its own. I've reached out to Google for clarity here.\n\nEven though Google allows kids to lift restrictions when they turn 13, they don't have total access to all of Google's services. According to this support doc, there are some key age-restricted content and services that require users to be 18 or older, including:\n\nThat's it, at least according to Google's safety doc. I've reached out to Google again for clarity on what other restrictions are in place on accounts between ages 13 and 18, and will update this article when I know more.\n\nThis is all changing, however. Kate Charlet, Google's head of global privacy, safety, and security, posted on LinkedIn as well, acknowledging the current policy and asserting that Google has changes in the works. Soon enough, Google will require both the child and the parent to agree to lift supervision. That should help parents who aren't ready to let their 13 year old access standard YouTube and other Google services without their permission.\n\nOf course, for parents that have already received an email about their kids reaching \"the age of digital consent,\" this might not offer much solace.",

    "title": "This Little-Known Peloton Feature Customizes Instructor-Led Classes for You",
    "description": "You can personalize how much instruction you get in Peloton classes.",
    "fullText": "I have taught spin classes for four years, but the majority of my friends have never taken one—they're just not \"class\" people. Everyone works out differently and classes are a very specific kind of experience. I take a class nearly every day, whether in-person or using my Peloton, so obviously I am firmly in the pro-class category, but I can understand why being blabbed at by an instructor wouldn't motivate some people. I learned recently, though, that Peloton offers a solution to those who don't enjoy all the yap: You can actually customize how much of their in-app instructors you hear, so whether you want to pay close attention to cues or hear practically nada from the teacher, you can make it happen, creating a truly custom \"class\" experience.\n\nIf you're using a Peloton machine, like the Bike or the Tread, locate the volume buttons on your touchscreen. When you press them, not only can you control the overall volume output of the class you're taking, but you get options like Boost instructor and Customize. When you tap Customize, you're presented with a slider that can reduce the volume of the instructor down to practically nothing or boost them so they're significantly louder than the music in the class's playlist.\n\nOn the mobile app, you have a similar option for classes that don't require the brand's proprietary cardio equipment, though it's not always as customizable. First, load up a class (like stretching or yoga). The video of the instructor walking you through it will start to play. Tap the video itself and you'll get a menu of icons that show what appears to be a phone turning on its side (to play the video full-screen), a volume slider, a Bluetooth caster to enable AirPlay across other devices in the area, and a speech bubble for subtitles. Tap that volume slider, the second icon from the left. It opens an Audio Mix box that allows you to choose whether you want Music Boosted or Instructor Boosted. You can't control the mix between the music and the instructor as precisely as you can when you're using the equipment, but you can at least prioritize the music or the teacher.\n\nSome of Peloton's instructors are notoriously chatty. Personally, I think it's endearing and I see nothing wrong with the parasocial relationships it creates if those motivate someone to hop on their Bike more often. The instructors are beamed into hundreds of thousands of homes every month and are akin to celebrities, so it's good for marketing and engagement if users feel connected to them, especially because at-home workouts are otherwise pretty isolating (although Peloton offers plenty of other ways to replicate the feeling of connectedness you get from in-person classes, like Teams competitions).\n\nStill, some people aren't trying to replicate that feeling; they just want to work out by themselves with no chatter. Usually, that means loading up your own music or taking one of Peloton's scenic rides, but the trade-off there is that you don't get a well-planned workout designed by a professional trainer, like you do when you take an instructor-led class. You trade the suggested resistance and speed for something self-paced, which can be detrimental to motivation or effort. By cutting down the volume of the instructor's mic and amplifying the playlist, you get to take a real class, follow along with the resistance and speed cues on the screen, and listen to a playlist you don't have to bother curating. If you don't care what a teacher had for breakfast but do care to follow along with a 45-minute progressive push because it aligns with your fitness goals, turning down the instructor volume could be for you.\n\nThat said, there is a reason these classes are instructor-led. Teachers are certified for a reason and the ones on high-profile platforms like Peloton are well-credentialed. They provide safety cues, insights into why playlists and rides are structured the way they are, and helpful information you can carry into your self-led workouts—plus motivation when you need it. I wouldn't recommend cutting out the instructor volume if you're a beginner. There is value in hearing what a pro has to say about form, speed, and self-pacing. You should only cut it out if you're a seasoned rider with good form and a solid understanding of your own abilities and limits. That said, if you're just getting started with Peloton and have concerns about your form or understanding of the workouts, it might even be worth it for you to use this feature the opposite way, prioritizing the instructor feed and deprioritizing the music. Riding to the beat will come in time, but doing it safely and effectively is most important.\n\nIf you're a newbie and you don't like instructor chatter, I recommend filtering your classes so you only take ones from the less-talkative teachers, like Ben Alldis, Sam Yo, Matt Wilpers, and Leanne Hainsby. It might take you some time to find the instructor whose methods align best with your interests and motivators, but it's worth it. You can also take specialty Metrics classes, which are designed to focus more heavily on performance metrics like cadence, resistance, and output. Those have less talking overall.",

    "title": "I Finally Got My Hands on Oura’s New Charging Case",
    "description": "At $99, it's more expensive than other brands' cases, but it's also slimmer.",
    "fullText": "Oura announced last week that its long-awaited charging case is finally shipping. I got one to try out, and can confirm that it works well and is arguably better designed than those of its competitors. That said, is it really worth $99?\n\nThe charging case works with the Oura Ring 4, not the older models like the gen 3. I’ve previously reviewed the Oura Ring 4, and it’s probably the best smart ring out there right now. You pay a premium for it, though—not only are Oura’s prices higher than many of its competitors ($349 to $499), Oura also requires a $5.99/month subscription to access nearly all of its features.\n\nThe standard charger that ships with any of the Oura rings is a simple flat square with a post that the ring fits onto. (The square base then plugs into a USB-C cord.) This works fine, but it’s inconvenient to travel with, and also susceptible to jostling. Maybe you never bump things around on your nightstand, or snag a charging cable, but it’s certainly happened to me.\n\nLike other Oura users, I’ve been wishing for a charging case. RingConn and Luna Ring both come with cases, so it would be nice if Oura would catch up. I usually keep my ring in my gym bag during weightlifting workouts (since it’s neither comfortable nor useful in those workouts). I plan to keep the charging case in my gym bag and use it during workouts.\n\nOura says the case holds enough power for five full charges of the ring, and it takes up to 80 minutes to charge the ring (less if the ring is partially charged, obviously). The case itself charges in 90 minutes.\n\nI haven’t been able to test the case in the long term, since I just got it, but the ring has a battery life of five days or more depending on the size of the ring and the settings you have enabled. That means you could go about a month without charging from a cable.\n\nThe case is sized to your ring, so you have to make sure to buy the correct size of charging case—for example, a size 8 case for a size 8 ring.\n\nThere’s a colored LED on the front of the charging case. When a ring is inside and charging, a white LED will pulse, just like the nightstand charger does. When the case is empty and open, it will indicate the case’s charge level. Green means the battery is full. The case pairs to your Oura app, so you can check the app to see the charge level of both your ring and the case.\n\nI happen to have a Luna Ring and a RingConn gen 2, which both ship with a charging case. Luna’s case holds about 30 days of charge, similar to Oura’s, while RingConn says its case can hold 150 days of charge.\n\nThe other noticeable difference is size. RingConn’s case is the largest of the three, which probably explains its longer battery life. Oura’s case is slightly wider than Luna’s, but slimmer. You can see the size differences in my photos here.\n\nRingConn’s case comes with the ring, and costs $299 for the package. Luna charges $329 for a ring plus charging case. (I recall Luna’s charging case being optional, and available for an extra $49, as I wrote here, but right now I can only find the package deal on their site.) Oura’s charging case is sold separately, for $99, so you’d spend $448 to $598 for the ring plus the case.",

    "fullText": "Hey, would you mind doing me a favor real quick? If you're on an iPhone, can you double check that you've got RCS chat enabled for me? Thanks, I appreciate it. See, as an Android user, I don't get to use all the fun iMessage features, but RCS lets us share some of them. The only problem is, iPhones seem to sometimes disable RCS for some chats after an update. Or for no reason at all.\n\nRCS has been around for a while, but since it needs to be supported on both the carrier and device level, it's taken some time to reach ubiquity. Understandably, you might have seen some chat conversations between iOS and Android users that still default to the older SMS-style texting, and just gone about your day. However, these days, if you're chatting with your Android friends and you don't see read receipts, or your pictures and videos are coming through in potato quality, there's probably an easy fix.\n\nTo check if RCS is enabled on your phone:\n\nOpen the Settings app on your iOS device, then go to Apps.\n\nEnable the RCS Messaging toggle.\n\nAnd that's it! If you text your contacts from multiple devices, it's also worth checking for RCS support on each of them. It might be a little annoying, but trust me, your Android friends will thank you.\n\nIf you're the one using an Android phone, it can also be worth double-checking that RCS support is enabled, although it's less likely to be a problem. While iOS devices support both iMessage and RCS as robust texting options, Android only has RCS. Both platforms can fall back to SMS, but your Android phone probably reaches for RCS as a default.\n\nStill, it can't hurt to check. The specific directions will differ based on manufacturer, but generally you can go to your default messaging app's settings and look for an \"RCS Chats\" section to make sure the protocol is enabled on your end as well.",

    "title": "Google Is Changing Its Account Policy About Minors Who Turn 13",
    "description": "They now need a parent's permission before removing supervision on their Google Account.",
    "fullText": "If you have a Family Account through Google, you might assume you can control what your child can see or do on their device. You can, but, as it happens, only up to a certain point. When your kid turns 13, Google will send them an email, letting them know they can choose to disable your supervision over their account. You get an email too, but they don't need your permission to lock you out of their device. Once they decide they're ready for a relatively complete Google Account experience, it's their choice to make.\n\nDespite being Google's official policy, this situation was not common knowledge. Following a relatively viral LinkedIn post about the subject, parents were peeved at the notion of Google deciding that their 13 year old was ready to be unsupervised on the internet. Google's Family Account does allow kids to stay on supervised plans after they turn 13, but they can choose to remove the supervision at any point, which largely defeats the purpose. Unless your child really respects your rules, they likely won't keep their account locked down when they don't have to.\n\nLuckily for parents, that's now changing. In a separate LinkedIn post, Google's Kate Charlet announced that under a planned policy update, minors will need to get their parents' permission before disabling supervision. (Charlet also referred to turning 13 as the \"age of digital consent,\" which seems to me to be an extremely strange way to say \"old enough to have an unsupervised Google Account.\")\n\nWhen I reached out to Google about the changes, the company told me that the policy should now be adjusted. As such, 13-year-olds shouldn't be able to remove supervision without permission. That said, Google's support documents have not yet been updated, so it might take some time to fully roll out.\n\nSpeaking of Google's former support documents, the company notes that when kids did choose to remove permissions, their device would lock up temporarily. When I asked Google about this, I was told that due to the change in policy, device lock is no longer a feature. However, it's still unclear to me how this feature worked when kids could remove permissions on their own: Did parents have to manually unlock the device for their kids? Would devices unlock after a set period of time? I've reached back out to Google about these questions, though they might not matter once teens need their parents' permission.\n\nAs I explain in my post here, removing supervision takes a lot of controls away from parents, and gives teens a lot more responsibility. Parents can't control screen time, manage payment cards and transactions, and can't block standard YouTube in favor of YouTube Kids. In addition, kids can choose to stop sharing their location with you if they want to.\n\nBut now that parents have the authority here, these controls can continue for your 13-year-old. If you want them to keep their location turned on, they won't have the option to turn it off; if you want to monitor their transactions, they can't stop you; if you don't want them having a credit card, they won't be able to add one—at least, until you manually disable supervision on your end.\n\nIt's a good thing that Google is giving families more options, and it joins other big tech companies, like Meta, doing the same.",

    "description": "New Chelsea manager has pledged to speak to Raheem Sterling and Axel Disasi, who were left in limbo by the previous boss.",
    "fullText": "New Chelsea manager Liam Rosenior has pledged to speak to Raheem Sterling and Axel Disasi, who have been left in limbo as part of the so-called 'bomb squad'.\n\nThe 41-year-old Englishman, who replaced Enzo Maresca last week, is working through an extensive list of tasks after joining mid-season from Strasbourg, which shares ownership with Chelsea.\n\nOne priority is to speak to Sterling and Disasi, who joined during the 2023-24 season for £47.5m and £38.5m respectively, but are currently training at different times, on a separate pitch and in a separate building from the main squad. Both remain on the transfer list and turned down potential loan moves over the summer.\n\nAsked about the pair, Rosenior said: \"I will have conversations with them. We're in January, as you know.\n\n\"Raheem's had an outstanding career. I've got huge respect for him. Axel is someone I've really, really liked as a player for a long time.\n\n\"Honestly, I have to have a conversation with them. I have to have a conversation with the club. I'm being genuinely honest. I literally have got to work through a list of priorities. I will do in the next few days.\"\n\nSterling is attracting interest from Napoli, while Roma and Lyon have explored a move for Disasi, but Chelsea currently have a maximum of six players out on overseas loans, per Fifa's rules, and would have to cancel one to allow the pair to move on a temporary deal.\n\nChelsea are usually active in every transfer window but have had a slow start to January following the managerial change. Insiders insist the club's strategy will remain similar, although Rosenior's voice will now be part of the discussion after Maresca's falling out with the hierarchy led to his unplanned mid-season exit.\n\nOn potential signings, Rosenior added: \"The first conversation I had with the guys [the club's hierarchy] was I want to assess the most important players, which are the ones who are here. Normally you get good surprises if you give people a chance.\n\n\"I had some really, really good surprises in the game against Charlton. Yes, we're in January, and yes, we want the club to be as successful as possible in the short term.\n\n\"But I also think sometimes the answers lie within the building and not outside. So I'll make a decision on that with the guys. Probably later in the week when I've seen everyone.\"\n\nChelsea are expected to make more significant signings in the summer, when their preferred targets are likely to be available.\n\nA high-quality attacker is high on the list of priorities as highlighted by Chelsea briefly checking the conditions to sign Antoine Semenyo before he joined Manchester City. Chelsea similarly considered a move for Dean Huijsen in the summer before his move to Real Madrid and will look at adding at centre-back.\n\nRennes defender Jeremy Jacquet is among those admired, while the Blues have been tracking Juventus forward Kenan Yildiz, although other unnamed options will also be considered. Chelsea have been linked with St Etienne striker Djylian N'Guessan, but he is a target for sister club Strasbourg in France.\n\nThey are also known admirers of Manchester United's Kobbie Mainoo, who has fewer than 18 months remaining on his contract at Old Trafford, with options in midfield to potentially be considered if Romeo Lavia continues to struggle with injury. Back-up goalkeeper Filip Jorgensen is currently assessing his options and would need replacing if he leaves.\n\nAcademy graduate Tyrique George has struggled to make recent matchday squads and is available for sale again after his £22m summer move to Fulham collapsed on deadline day. The option to leave on loan would also be considered.\n\nThe west London club remain under substantial restrictions from Uefa in January to maintain a \"positive transfer balance\" and must offset any incoming deals with outgoings.\n\nHowever, those restrictions will lift next season, coinciding with the Premier League introducing new Squad Cost Control ratio rules, which are less restrictive than the current Profit and Sustainability (PSR) regulations.\n\nChelsea have already lined up a host of players for next season, including £40m Sporting winger Geovany Quenda, Strasbourg striker Emanuel Emegha, Kairat forward Dastan Satapayev and Corinthians left-back Denner Evangelista. The Blues also recently completed a deal to sign defender Deinner Ordonez from Independiente del Valle to join in January 2028.\n\nOthers currently away on loan, like Aaron Anselmino at Borussia Dortmund and Strasbourg trio Mike Penders, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez, remain highly regarded, with the latter three having played for Rosenior in France.",

    "fullText": "Real Madrid's decision to appoint Alvaro Arbeloa as head coach has been met largely with scepticism. Many supporters see the move as an unnecessary, premature risk rather than a bold, strategic appointment.\n\nOn the surface, the choice appears puzzling. Arbeloa lacks the glittering senior managerial CV you may expect a Real Madrid head coach to have.\n\nBut behind the initial reaction, the move reflects Real Madrid's prioritisation of identity and continuity, with those inside the club viewing it not as a gamble but as a calculated decision based on the loyalty of someone who has been part of Real for many years.\n\nIt is a philosophy that was made clear by Arbeloa himself at his unveiling.\n\n\"On Saturday I turn 43 and 20 of those years have been at this club. Every day I'm at the best club in the world,\" he said.\n\n\"This club is about winning, winning, and winning again. When I was a player, I learned those values from the people in that dressing room. They're still there, and that's what matters.\"\n\nHere we explore what Arbeloa might bring to the role, judging by his time behind the scenes coaching youth and reserve teams at Madrid and what he said at his first news conference. And we look at why there is still uncertainty over the club's long-term direction, despite the appointment.",

    "fullText": "Hop is a little frog with big dreams. He wants to explore life outside his forest, and his call to adventure is rewarded with the unexpected ability to leapfrog between worlds and even dimensions. Luckshot Games, the developer and publisher of Big Hops, appears to be similarly ambitious, if this game is any indication. Big Hops is a modest 3D platformer that takes on some of the biggest in the industry, on their own turf, with confidence and poise. Even when it very occasionally falls just short, you can't help but respect the pluck it took to aim so high. Big Hops is a game centered on joyous movement that should put Luckshot on players' radars going forward.\n\nFrom the very start, before Hop even leaves his homey little forest dwelling, you can sense Big Hops' inspirations. Hop's movement and (ahem) hops feel reminiscent of how Mario moves in Super Mario Odyssey, even including a belly slide that you can use to keep your forward momentum going. But on top of that, it layers in a few other elements. You can wall-run like in Prince of Persia or Titanfall. You can climb any wall a la Zelda: Breath of the Wild, complete with a stamina meter that determines how long you can cling to a surface. Your stretchy frog-tongue acts as a grapple to swing on hooks and grab handles, and it also makes it easy to grab things like bugs or fruits out of trees. It all feels so immediately natural, and part of the fun of Big Hops is learning how to connect your suite of movement options together.\n\nBefore long, Hop meets Diss, a strange extradimensional imp with a snarky attitude and questionable motivations. Diss spirits Hop away to The Void, a bridge between realms where gravity is strange and twisting upon itself. I couldn't help but be reminded of the flexible gravity system of Super Mario Galaxy, as Hop made a jump and suddenly landed upside-down with a changed perspective, but by this time the natural movement felt so smooth that the shift was easy to navigate.\n\nDiss tells Hop that he has to venture to various worlds to collect little globules of dark energy, which he calls Dark Drips, for reasons he refuses to explain. But in the very first world, Hop also finds a kindly mechanic who promises to build him an airship that will take him home if he gathers the correct parts. Diss tells him the Airship won't matter if he doesn't collect the Dark Drips, so Hop sets about doing both at once: collecting Dark Drips for Diss, while searching for Airship parts in the hopes he can circumvent being stuck in the imp's service. But Hop, who wanted more than anything to explore beyond his forest, finds that once he's out in the world, he just wants to get home to his family.\n\nEach of the three worlds you visit has its own individual peoples and its own story, usually revolving around culture clashes: a rabbit family business that isn't addressing a sinkhole that's alarming citizens, or an otter-run oil pumping operation suffers an acrimonious split between its founders. These are endearing fables that each end up feeling somewhat resolved, but not entirely. That seems like an intentional choice, to show how conflicts sometimes don't wrap up in a neat-and-tidy way. In what appears a less intentional choice, the overarching story with Diss and the Dark Drips speeds to a conclusion that loses the plot somewhat near the end, where I had trouble tracking exactly what was happening and why.\n\nAnd so you navigate each world, finding little droplets of void energy along main paths and hidden in secret nooks, while also completing major quests for Airship parts. Aside from a couple of boss fights, there aren't enemies to contend with, just platforming obstacles. Collecting a requisite number of Dark Drips lets you go to Diss and trade for trinkets that imbue you with extra abilities, such as reduced stamina requirements or friction on belly slides, compass indicators for various collectibles, shop discounts, and more. One even gives you total invincibility, permanently, at the cost of all of your trinket slots. It's an extremely flexible system that lets you approach the world as you'd like. I only wished there were loadouts to make it easier to swap between them quickly.\n\nAside from the Dark Drips, the worlds have lots of other little collectibles to grab. Coins scattered in pots and around hidden corners can be exchanged for cosmetic outfits and items such as stamina potions, which give you a one-time boost to your stamina. You can get the same boost by eating bugs you find around the world, which comes with a cute little science lesson identifying a bug the first time you catch it. There's even a shopkeeper who rewards you with unique items for finding lots of different species of bugs.\n\nBut the absolute best items are the various strange fruits and seeds you see growing on trees across the various worlds that can be utilized to aid your traversal. These power-ups start simply enough--an acorn picked from a tree and then tossed into the ground will quickly grow a towering vine that lets you climb up. But these only get more wild with subsequent fruits that you find, letting you summon bouncy bubbles, shift the gravity, explode certain walls, create a floating zero-G void zone, and more. And since you can grab these items and store them in your backpack for later, there aren't strict guardrails on how you can use them. The only limitation is that you need an object or surface to toss the fruit against to activate it, so you can't (for example) create an effect in mid-air. That slight limitation helps keep the mechanics in check, but for the most part you have total freedom. Often, Big Hops feels like you're breaking the game and finding your own way, only to realize that Luckshot gave you that degree of freedom on purpose, and often knew how you'd use it.\n\nThat makes it slightly more disappointing, though, when the game briefly gets overly restrictive. In the third world in particular, there's an extended segment with mine carts that feels slightly janky, and there is no obvious way to circumvent its more stringent requirements. It's a minor blemish, but it helps to illustrate that Big Hops is at its best when it's embracing freedom, and less successful when it feels, sometimes literally, on rails.\n\nFor a smaller game, though, Big Hops has impressive production values. Hop and Diss themselves are great character designs, and the worlds generally look very impressive and vibrant. Many of the characters are fully voiced, with great performances that lend life and personality to the characters. There are brief moments you can sense its limitations--most characters don't actually move and will instead just leave and then appear further down the path where you meet up with them, for example. But for the most part, its execution matches its ambitions.\n\nBig Hops is a testament to how much fun can be had with simple ideas done well. Hop has a modest suite of moves, finely tuned, that string together in ways to make movement feel free-flowing and exuberant. On top of that strong foundation, it layers on flexibility making the worlds you explore feel like playgrounds for your creative thinking and platforming finesse. Altogether, the result is a delightful platformer, and the first great game of 2026.",

    "title": "Trump’s Slash-and-Burn Economy Is Devastating Black Women",
    "description": "Kali...",
    "fullText": "His administration is hitting them with “discriminate harm.”\n\nElections have consequences—and they are, unfailingly, most profoundly visited upon Black women. Donald Trump’s reelection has had the consequence of Black women being pushed out of their workplaces at astonishing rates. Between February and July of last year, Black women lost 319,000 jobs in both the private and public sectors, driven largely by mass layoffs in education, healthcare, and housing. During that same period, white women gained 142,000 jobs, Hispanic women 176,000 jobs, and white men—wait for it!—picked up 365,000 jobs. In February, Black women’s unemployment rate stood at 5.4 percent, but that figure had soared to 6.7 percent by August. In September, the most recent snapshot available because of the shutdown, yet another 0.8 percent of Black women lost their jobs—while just 0.2 percent of white women suffered the same fate that month. All in all, according to the gender economist Katica Roy, roughly 600,000 Black women have been “economically sidelined” since February—which was, not coincidentally, this president’s first full month in office.\n\nThis has failed to set off alarm bells in a country that has never cared much about the well-being of Black women. Perhaps that’s why concerned policymakers and economists so often take such pains to emphasize that Black women’s economic distress is a bellwether for everyone else—to underline that their fates, and even their humanity, are connected to the nation’s in the hopes that the country might finally care. And it’s not just that racism and sexism make Black women the first to be let go when the economy stalls—it’s also that Black women power the economy in ways this country often refuses to acknowledge. Nearly 70 percent of Black mothers are the breadwinners in their homes, though they’re paid just 34, 44, or 52 cents of every dollar paid to Asian, white, or Black breadwinner dads, respectively. So when they lose jobs en masse, families are left financially vulnerable and local economies are weakened. Nationally, the cost has already surpassed $37 billion in lost GDP.\n\nBut it’s disingenuous to suggest that Black women are merely hit the hardest during economic slumps when, in fact, they’ve been targeted for harm by a right wing that is openly committed to undoing their progress. This country has—again—chosen to meet gender and racial advancement with aggressive rollbacks, including dismantling institutions that have provided Black women with financial security and career advancement. It’s not a coincidence that the first move of the Trump administration, in partnership with Elon Musk’s DOGE, was to vilify and hollow out the civil service—long an engine of Black middle-class stability—where Black women make up 12 percent of staffers, double their portion of the overall workforce. A National Women’s Law Center study found that women and people of color made up the majority of the workforce in the agencies that sustained the deepest cuts. The Department of Education, with a workforce of 28 percent Black women, lost 46 percent of its staff. The Department of Justice and the Department of Energy, both of which are about 70 percent white? Cut by just 1 percent and 13 percent, respectively, according to a ProPublica analysis.\n\nThe Trump administration has also made a show of pushing out high-profile Black women leaders, including Carla Hayden at the Library of Congress, Gwynne Wilcox at the National Labor Relations Board, and the ongoing effort to oust Lisa Cook at the Federal Reserve. Peggy Carr has described her abrupt dismissal after 35 years of climbing the ranks at the Department of Education as a “tragedy” both personal and professional. “It was like I was being taken out like the trash,” Carr told The New York Times of being escorted out of the building by a security guard, “the only difference is I was being taken out the front door rather than the back door.”\n\nThose public-sector layoffs have been accompanied by attacks on private-sector diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, or DEI. NPR reports that roles in DEI plummeted from 20,000 in 2023 to 17,500 in April 2025. Companies too numerous to name have hastily retreated from DEI efforts they had boasted about earlier, and not because they are mandated to, since Trump’s anti-DEI executive orders cannot overturn civil-rights laws or dictate the hiring practices of private businesses. A New York Times investigation found that the number of S&P 500 companies that include DEI language in their financial filings is down 60 percent since 2024. And for the first time since 2017, the majority of new directors hired at S&P 500 companies this year were white men.\n\nBlack women have long worked at rates higher than other American women, including as recently as 2024. But even in the best of times, intertwined sexism and anti-Black racism, or misogynoir, consign them to the most precarious jobs in the least recession-proof sectors. Across industries, they are paid less than white men with the same—and even, in some comparisons, lower—levels of education; are least likely of all women to be promoted; and leave college burdened with the most student-loan debt. Now Trump has launched what Representative Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) rightly calls a campaign of “discriminate harm” against them. History vividly illustrates what the consequences will be. After economic downturns in the early 1980s, the Great Recession of the aughts, and the Covid pandemic, Black women were the last to recover financially. But this time, the Trump administration has scrubbed race-based employment data from government websites—preemptively erasing evidence of the harms it’s inflicting.\n\nWhen Black women voted against this regime, they were fighting for their lives at the ballot box, knowing they’d be the first to bear the brunt of its damages—and fully aware they wouldn’t be the last. It was, of course, not enough to stop a country unwilling to heed their warnings. So once again we’re trapped, forced to inhale the noxious fumes no one else notices are poisoning us all.",

    "fullText": "Trump’s brazen violation of international law destabilizes global security.\n\nThe wisest condemnation of Donald Trump’s decision to send us troops to the sovereign nation of Venezuela to remove President Nicolás Maduro, as part of the administration’s plan to “run” Venezuela in collaboration with US oil companies, came 205 years before Trump announced his “Donroe” Doctrine.\n\nIn 1821, Secretary of State John Quincy Adams, who played an essential role in crafting the Monroe Doctrine—the foreign-policy position that he and others hoped would guard the Western Hemisphere against the threat of European colonial expansion—explicitly rejected military interventions for the purpose of regime change and economic conquest. “Wherever the standard of freedom and Independence has been or shall be unfurled, there will [America’s] heart, her benedictions and her prayers be,” Adams told Congress. “But she goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy.”\n\nEven where the United States might object to a foreign leader, Adams argued that the country must lead by example and with diplomacy, so that the fundamental maxims of US foreign policy would not change insensibly from liberty to force: “She well knows that by once enlisting under other banners than her own, were they even the banners of foreign independence, she would involve herself beyond the power of extrication, in all the wars of interest and intrigue, of individual avarice, envy, and ambition, which assume the colors and usurp the standard of freedom.”\n\nTrump, acting very much as a European king of old, attacked Venezuela as this edition of The Nation went to press. His move represents a brazen violation of international law that destabilizes global security and seizes Congress’s exclusive authority to declare war. Military force is justified only in response to a clear, credible, and imminent threat to  the security of the US or its treaty allies. Venezuela, whatever its internal dysfunctions or its connections to drug trafficking, poses no such threat.\n\nTrump’s scheming to forcibly determine the political leadership of another sovereign nation represents a grave departure from our best principles—as stated by Adams—and a return to the most discredited habits of American foreign policy. We are not naïve about American history. Throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, The Nation has decried presidential abuses of the Monroe Doctrine as a tool for the creation of corporate client states. But Trump’s self-styled Donroe Doctrine proposes a fresh bastardization of US foreign policy that is so extreme—and so dangerous—that it demands an urgent response from Democrats and those Republicans whose oath to the Constitution takes higher precedence than their loyalty to an authoritarian president and his fossil-fuel-industry donors.\n\nWhile Trump and his allies tried to justify naked aggression as part of a convoluted strategy to target “narco-terrorism,” Representative Pat Ryan (D-NY), a former Army intelligence officer who served two combat tours during the Iraq War, declared, “No matter what they say, it’s always oil.” Ryan was not alone in recognizing echoes of the WMD claims of former president George W. Bush, and how that blood-for-oil war went so horribly awry. In his first bid for the presidency, Trump positioned himself as something of an anti-war Republican. That was always a cynical gambit, and Trump is now exposed as an economic imperialist who learned nothing from Iraq and who is willing, as Representative Thomas Massie (R-KY) noted, to embark on a career of empire that risks the lives of US troops to make “oil companies (not Americans) more profitable.”\n\nNo one in their right mind believes that the madness—and danger—of Trump’s Donroe Doctrine will halt at the borders of Venezuela. His State Department declared on social media: “This is OUR Hemisphere, and President Trump will not allow our security to be threatened.” The American people see through the lies. A Reuters-Ipsos poll found that only 33 percent of Americans approve of the US military action to remove Maduro, while 72 percent worry about further US involvement in Venezuela.\n\nThis popular rejection of Trump’s territorial ambitions should inspire members of Congress to stand up to the administration—recognizing, as John Quincy Adams did, that if a president seeks to make America “the dictatress of the world,” this country will “be no longer the ruler of her own spirit.”",
