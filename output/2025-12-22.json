    "description": "A look at the Patriots’ game day roster for their Week 16 game on Sunday night.",
    "fullText": "With Robert Spillane sidelined throughout the game, the New England Patriots’ linebacker group had a disappointing outing last week versus the Buffalo Bills. The challenge will not be any easier for the position on Sunday night against the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nNot only will Spillane miss a second straight game because of an ankle injury, the Ravens feature one of the best run games in the NFL. Led by the two-headed monster of quarterback Lamar Jackson and running back Derrick Henry, they are entering Sunday as the league leaders in yards per carry (5.2).\n\nWith Spillane out, that means the task on stopping this potent an attack will fall on replacement starting duo Jack Gibbens and Christian Elliss. As head coach Mike Vrabel pointed out on Friday, however, they will not be the only one in the spotlight.\n\n“Everybody that goes to the game is going to play and have a role, and we ask everybody to prepare as starters,” Vrabel explained. “That’s something that’s important. And so, Gibby will start in there, and then different guys will play, packages and everything else.”\n\nNew England’s full game day roster against the Ravens looks as follows:\n\nQuarterback (2): Drake Maye (10), Joshua Dobbs (11)\n\nRunning back (4): Rhamondre Stevenson (38), TreVeyon Henderson (32), D’Ernest Johnson (34), Jack Westover (37 | FB/TE)\n\nWide receiver (5): Kayshon Boutte (9), Stefon Diggs (8), Mack Hollins (13), DeMario Douglas (3), Kyle Williams (18 | KR)\n\nTight end (2): Hunter Henry (85), Austin Hooper (81)\n\nOffensive tackle (3): Vederian Lowe (59 | LT), Morgan Moses (76 | RT), Thayer Munford Jr. (74)\n\nInterior offensive line (5): Jared Wilson (58 | LG), Garrett Bradbury (65 | C), Mike Onwenu (71 | RG), Ben Brown (77), Caedan Wallace (70)\n\nInterior defensive line (5): Christian Barmore (90), Khyiris Tonga (95 | FB), Cory Durden (94), Eric Gregory (55), Joshua Farmer (92)\n\nDefensive edge (5): Harold Landry III (2), K’Lavon Chaisson (44), Elijah Ponder (91), Anfernee Jennings (33), Bradyn Swinson (43)\n\nLinebacker (5): Jack Gibbens (51), Christian Elliss (53), Jahlani Tavai (48), Marte Mapu (15), Chad Muma (49)\n\nCornerback (5): Christian Gonzalez (0), Carlton Davis III (7), Marcus Jones (25 | PR), Charles Woods (22), Miles Battle (35)\n\nSafety (4): Jaylinn Hawkins (21), Craig Woodson (31), Dell Pettus (24), Brenden Schooler (41)\n\nSpecialists (3): Andy Borregales (36 | K), Bryce Baringer (17 | P/H), Julian Ashby (47 | LS)\n\nThe Patriots’ front seven is seeing some changes compared to last week. Not only is Chad Muma active as extra depth at linebacker and on special teams just five days after getting claimed off waivers from the Indianapolis Colts, two recent inactives are also up this week: Eric Gregory will provide additional depth at defensive tackle, while Bradyn Swinson should help on the edge.\n\nSwinson’s presence on the game day roster comes in light of starter Harold Landry being questionable with a knee injury. The fifth-round rookie has appeared in one game so far, playing 10 snaps in the kicking game but none on defense.\n\nInactives (5): QB3 Tommy DeVito (16), WR Efton Chism III (86), TE C.J. Dippre (82), OT Marcus Bryant (52), LB Robert Spillane (14)\n\nPractice squad (16): RB Jashaun Corbin (30), WR John Jiles (83), WR Jeremiah Webb (29), OL Sebastian Gutierrez (72), OL Andrew Rupcich (67), OL Brenden Jaimes (61), OL Mehki Butler (63), DT Jeremiah Pharms Jr. (98), DT Leonard Taylor III (93), DT Fabien Lovett Sr. (96), LB Amari Gainer (45), LB Otis Reese (54), CB Brandon Crossley (46), CB Kobee Minor (19), S Richie Grant (39), S John Saunders Jr. (23)\n\nPractice squad/exempt (1): TE Thomas Odukoya (88 | IPPP)\n\nPractice squad/injured (2): RB Craig Reynolds, LB Darius Harris\n\nReserve/injured (11): FB Brock Lampe, OT Yasir Durant, CB Marcellas Dial Jr., DT Jaquelin Roy, RB Lan Larison, RB Deneric Prince, DT Isaiah Iton, RB Antonio Gibson, DT Milton Williams, CB Alex Austin, OT Will Campbell, RB Terrell Jennings\n\nReserve/retired (1): OL Wes Schweitzer\n\nWith no players elevated from the practice squad, a total of five players were ruled out on Sunday. The list includes no surprises, with Spillane, who was deemed inactive ahead of the weekend already, as the only noteworthy absence.\n\nThe Patriots’ game against the Ravens will kick off at 8:20 p.m. ET at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore.",

    "fullText": "The Denver Broncos rolled into Week 16 against the Jacksonville Jaguars riding an 11-game win streak with visions of clinching the No. 1 seed in the AFC playoffs.\n\nThe Jaguars had other ideas. Sparked by another big game from quarterback Trevor Lawrence, the Jaguars steamrolled the vaunted Broncos' defense in Denver to secure a 34-20 win.\n\nWith the win, the Jaguars improve to 11-4 while turning the race for the No. 1 seed in the AFC into a five-team contest. The Broncos drop to 12-3, while the 11-4 Chargers, 11-4 Bills and 11-3 Patriots (ahead of Sunday night's game against the Ravens) all remain in the race for the first-round bye in the AFC playoff bracket.\n\nLawrence led the way while completing 23 of 36 passes for for 279 yards with 3 touchdowns and no interceptions. He added 20 yards and a fourth touchdown on the ground.\n\nThis, a week after Lawrence led a 48-20 romp over the Jets with 330 passing yards, 5 touchdowns and no turnovers. But that was against the Jets.\n\nSunday was against a Super Bowl-contending Broncos team with one of the best defenses in football. And if you weren't counting the Jaguars among Super Bowl contenders before, it's time to reconsider that stance.\n\nThe early portion of Sunday's contest was a back-and-forth affair that saw the Broncos tie the game at 17-17 early in the third quarter. But the tenor of the game took a dramatic shift on Jacksonville's first possession of the second half.\n\nSparked by a pair of big penalties, the Jaguars drove 75 yards for a touchdown. A roughing the passing penalty for bodyweight on a hit of Lawrence on first down moved the Jaguars across midfield and riled up the raucous Denver crowd.\n\nThen in the red zone on second down, the Broncos got flagged for pass interference in the end zone when Jahdae Barron grabbed Parker Washington's arm while the ball was in the air. This brought the home crowd into a frenzy.\n\nLawrence responded by running untouched into the end zone for 24-17 lead Jaguars lead.\n\nBack and forth we goooo@trevorlawrence | #JAXvsDEN on FOXpic.twitter.com/ySt0CgOLMW\n\n— Jacksonville Jaguars (@Jaguars) December 21, 2025\n\nThe Broncos had multiple chances to answer, but there was no Bo Nix magic in the second half this time.\n\nDenver punted after four plays on its ensuing possession. Following another Jaguars touchdown for a 31-17 lead, a botched handoff from Nix to Jaleel McLaughlin resulted in Denver's first turnover of the game. The Jaguars converted that fumble into a field goal for a 34-17 lead.\n\nThen with 8:08 remaining, Nix forced a sideline pass to Pat Bryant in tight coverage. Jarrian Jones was there for the interception to all but ice the Jacksonville win.\n\nBo Nix is intercepted by Jarrian Jones 👀\n\n📺 FOX pic.twitter.com/4pNMf0lkHU\n\n— FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) December 21, 2025\n\nFor the day, Nix completed 28 of 47 passes for 352 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception. He was credited with a lost fumble on the botched handoff in the third quarter. And the Jaguars finished the game with a 2-0 advantage in takeaways. Those turnovers ultimately tanked any hope of a Broncos comeback.\n\nEven with the loss, the Broncos maintain control of that No. 1 seed. Their 12-3 record remains alone atop the AFC. And they hold the tiebreaker over the Patriots if the Patriots win Sunday night.\n\nBut with two weeks remaining in the season, the race for that No. 1 seed is anything but settled. And the Chargers could still win the AFC West. The Broncos and Chargers will face off in Week 18, when the division title could be at stake.",

    "fullText": "Denver Broncos wide receiver Pat Bryant was carted off the field after taking a hard hit from Jacksonville Jaguars cornerback Montaric Brown on one of the final plays of Sunday's game at Empower Field at Mile High.\n\nBrown was initially penalized for the hit, but officials picked up the flag after the cornerback was deemed to have hit Bryant in the chest, not in the head. Players for both teams gathered around Bryant while he was on the ground. Denver quarterback Bo Nix slammed his helmet on the ground after the play.\n\nBryant was placed on a backboard and carted to the locker room with 31 seconds remaining.

    "description": "Bailey, Harper starting to make their mark in the NBA.",
    "fullText": "We are three months into the NBA season, and the two former superstars for Rutgers men’s basketball are proving why they were drafted high and are showing potential to dominate the league for years to come.\n\nAce Bailey, despite a slower start to the season, is playing his best basketball as of late. Bailey started the year by averaging 4.4 points per game in October. However, in the two months since then, Bailey has averaged 12.1 points in November and 11.5 points in December. He has already had three 20-point games and has all but three games in double-digit points in December. He has recorded several highlight-worthy shots, including the one below.\n\nBailey still has a lot of development to do to reach his maximum potential in the NBA. If his time so far is any indication, he is on an upward trajectory to reach that level. He was viewed as an all-around project when he was drafted by the Jazz. In particular, his field goal shooting percentage, defense, and rebounding still need a lot of work. Regardless, he has looked better and better with each passing game.\n\nHERE COMES ACE BAILEY ‼️\n\nTHE ROOK JUST ROCKED THE RIM IN UTAH.\n\nTap to watch: https://t.co/nnbneYnnKu pic.twitter.com/2bnTNCCWqB\n\nArguably, the more NBA-ready of the two when they declared for the draft, Dylan Harper has already demonstrated an ability to take over games, despite playing in the NBA for less than three whole months. Against Washington earlier in the month, Harper recorded 24 points and five rebounds in San Antonio’s dominating 119-94 win over the Wizards. This is not the first time this season he has recorded a similar stat line, as he has recorded games with 20 or more points and six or more rebounds two other times.\n\nHarper is averaging 48.2 percent on field goals, which is just above the average for NBA players, which has been 46.9 percent this season. However, this three-point percentage needs some work, as he is averaging 30.2 percent per game this season when the league average for three-point percentage per game is 35.8 percent.\n\nDylan Harper 24 Points, 5 Rebs, 3 Assists full highlight vs Wizards I 25-26 NBA Season pic.twitter.com/XfqF8sWvYR\n\n— Hoops Showtime (@HoopsShowtime12) December 19, 2025\n\nBoth have shown their ability to score so far in this league. Now they need to prove that they can be contributors in the other statistics. Those will likely start to click as they get more experience on an NBA court.\n\nRon Harper Jr. has spent most of his time this season on the Boston Celtics G League squad, the Maine Celtics. However, he has been called up to the main roster a few times, where he was largely used as a rotational piece due to injuries. Harper has seen action in four NBA games this season, seeing 20 minutes on the floor across all four. He has 8 points so far this season, with six of them coming in the Celtics game against the Memphis Grizzlies. He has three rebounds on the year as well, all of which came against Houston.",

With that, Shapiro believes no team is better set up for the next five years than the Red Sox.\n\n“Boston is probably positioned as well as any team in all of Major League Baseball,” Shapiro said on MLB Network Radio on Sunday. “I don’t know if there is a team that is positioned for the next five years better than the Boston Red Sox with young talent and flexibility.”\n\nIt’s a bold take from the Blue Jays CEO, as the Red Sox are a division rival of Toronto, but Shapiro clearly likes what he sees from Boston.\n\nWith Shapiro expecting the Red Sox to be better, he knows the AL East will be a tough division to win this year.\n\n“We already knew Baltimore was going to be better than they were last year,” Shapiro added. “All you have to do is look at them in the second half. They clearly have gotten better with Taylor Ward, with Shane Baz, and others.\n\n“They’ve had a good offseason, and I don’t think they are done. The Yankees are clearly, you know, they are not done. Tampa is going to be better; they are never bad, they are going to be better.”\n\nAlthough Shapiro believes everyone in the AL East will be better, his comments about the Red Sox stand out.\n\nRed Sox Reportedly Swing Huge Trade For Three-Time All-Star",

    "title": "Instant reaction: Broncos’ defense fizzles out as Jaguars route Denver 34-20",
    "description": "The Denver Broncos had their 11-game winning streak come to an end with their 34-20 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars.",
    "fullText": "The Denver Broncos hosted the roaring Jacksonville Jaguars in their Week 16 matchup. A gridiron battle of two division leaders, this one was expected to be a close and hard-fought matchup. It turned out to be the opposite, with the Jaguars throttling the Broncos 34-20 and ending their 11-game winning streak. Here are some instant reactions and key takeaways from today’s game.\n\nPenalties, drops, and miscues plague Broncos’ offensive effort\n\nLast week against the Green Bay Packers, Bo Nix and the offense had one of their most complete games of the season. In order to defeat the Jaguars, they needed to replicate some of that success. Sadly, that was far from the case with only several good drives through sixty minutes of play.\n\nAfter struggling in the first quarter, they were able muster a quality scoring drive early on in the second quarter. A 15-yard fade to Courtland Sutton tied the game up. A few drives later, Wil Lutz was able to connect on a 54-yard field goal to give the Broncos a 10-7 lead—but that was short-lived with Denver being down 17-10 at halftime.\n\nDenver’s first drive of the second half couldn’t have gone any better. Rookie running back RJ Harvey broke a few tackles and dove for the pylon to cap off a 38-yard touchdown scamper that tied the game up at 17. It was an absolutely marvelous play by the second-round pick. After that? There wasn’t much to write home about.\n\nThree-and-outs and stalled drives were a theme for the Broncos thereafter. A failed handoff exchange between Nix and Jaleel McLaughlin late in the third quarter was the straw that broke the camel’s back with Denver already down 31-17. In the fourth quarter down 34-20, Nix threw an interception on fourth down that officially ended any hopes of a miracle comeback.\n\nPenalties, drops, turnovers, and miscues all played a culprit in the Broncos’ regression on offense against the Jaguars. Ther only bright spot on offense was Harvey’s performance. It was in a losing effort, but over 120 all-purpose yards and a touchdown is praiseworthy. The team will continue to need him to play at a high level in the final weeks of the season to help secure the division title and top seed in the AFC.\n\nJarrian Jones picks off Nix!\n\nJAXvsDEN on FOX/FOX Onehttps://t.co/HkKw7uXnxV pic.twitter.com/F9MjGz2RRZ\n\nDefense fails to show up in worst performance of the season\n\nThe Jaguars entered today’s contest averaging well over 30 points a game since their bye week. Both Trevor Lawrence and Travis Etienne were on hot streaks. It was a big task for the Broncos to slow them down. Unfortunately, they struggled all game long and had their worst performance of the year. It was ugly throughout four quarters.\n\nOne area of concern I had was how safety P.J. Locke would hold up in coverage. He surrendered a touchdown reception to tight end Brenton Strange in the second quarter—aided by a clear push off by Strange. However, he was also targeted often on the Jaguars’ scoring drive right before halftime and also in the second half. It’s clear that Brandon Jones’ presence in the backend of Denver’s secondary was sorely missed.\n\nOn top of that, Lawrence was able to light up the Broncos’ red zone defense. Entering today’s game, Denver’s red zone defense was best in the NFL in ‘25 and a huge strength. Today? They gave up four touchdowns in Jacksonville’s first four trips inside the 20. That’s certainly not a recipe for success. It was Murphy’s Law for the Broncos on defense this afternoon.\n\nMissed tackles, missed coverage assignments, and penalties hampered Denver’s ability to thwart Jacksonville’s offensive endeavors. The Jaguars were routinely able to create yards after the catch and blow past Broncos defenders. It’s been a long time since we have seen them play this poorly. But perhaps a wakeup call was eventually in order. It’s really not worth mentioning ‘elite’ and this defense in the same sentence any longer.\n\nAfter multiple weeks of showing concerning weaknesses, all of the Broncos’ biggest flaws were exposed today. With only two games remaining before the playoffs, the team doesn’t have long to correct them. If they can’t, their hopes of a strong postseason push may be in jeopardy. Defensive Coordinator Vance Joseph and his players have their work cut out for them.\n\nThis Bronco Defense is all kinds of out of sorts. \n\nBusting coverages, not setting edges, no QB player on obvious Zone Read situations. \n\nTrevor Lawrence & Liam Cohen continue to punch the bruise. \n\nThe Brandon Jones loss looms larger than I would have expected.\n\n— Coach Mike Sanford (@Coach_Sanford2) December 21, 2025\n\nDenver can’t let this loss linger. Recalibrate and beat the Chiefs on Christmas.\n\nAll good things come to an end. It’s been an awesome season for the Broncos, but their eleven-game winning streak is now over. Getting pummeled at home by the Jaguars wasn’t on the radar for me. I thought the Broncos would win in a close game.\n\nA huge credit to Jacksonville for being the better team today. They executed a great gameplan on both sides of the ball. They also delivered Denver their first loss at home since October of last season. That’s pretty wild when you think about it.\n\nThat being said, the Broncos can’t afford to dwell on this loss and let it linger. They need to shift gears quickly and be prepared to defeat the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium on Christmas. There usually isn’t a good way to spin a loss, but this sort of adversity might be important for the Broncos to experience before the postseason hits.\n\nIt can serve as a bit of a reality check for them. Moreover, it’s certainly a woeful performance where there will be ample tape to show what they need to correct and improve upon. The next two games are against division rivals. They are must-win games for Denver to win the AFC West and find a way to edge out the competition for that coveted first-round bye and homefield advantage that comes with the #1 seed.\n\nWill the Broncos be able to show some tenacity and resiliency over the next two weeks? I sure hope so. So much is at stake. Let’s hope they can finish off the season strong with back-to-back wins. Although it isn’t going to be easy, especially with Pat Bryant and Dre Greenlaw being injured late in today’s game.\n\nProbably a good time to note that the Broncos can lose today and still get the No. 1 seed with 2 wins.\n\nAnd also that every time they've won the SB they've had back-to-back December losses. (Not saying you want that here, because that means losing to a KC team w/ its No. 3 QB)\n\n— Andrew Mason (@MaseDenver) December 21, 2025",

Houston did win, but it wasn't easy.\n\nIn a surprisingly competitive game, the Raiders took a second-half lead and the Texans needed to come back and then hold on in the fourth quarter to survive with a 23-21 win.\n\nTexans quarterback CJ Stroud completed 23 of 35 passes for 187 yards, with a touchdown and no interceptions. Raiders quarterback Geno Smith completed 16 of 23 passes for 201 yards, with two touchdowns and one interception.\n\nThe star of the game for the Raiders was rookie running back Ashton Jeanty, who had 24 carries for 128 yards and a touchdown, and added a 60-yard receiving touchdown. In an up-and-down rookie season, Jeanty showed everything the Raiders wanted to see from him today.\n\nBut it wasn't enough, and the Texans won to improve to 10-5 and stay in contention for both the AFC South and a wild card berth.

    "fullText": "Things went from bad to worse for the Kansas City Chiefs at the quarterback position on Sunday against the Tennessee Titans.\n\nThe Chiefs had already taken a major blow as they lost starting quarterback and multi-time Super Bowl Champion Patrick Mahomes last week to a torn ACL in a loss to the Chargers that eliminated the team from playoff contention for the first time in over a decade. But just when Chiefs fans thought the tough times couldn't get much tougher, that is exactly what happened as backup quarterback Gardner Minshew left the game against the Titans due to injury.\n\nThe real kicker? Early reports indicate that Minshew also tore his ACL, becoming the second quarterback for the Chiefs to do so in two weeks – and forcing Kansas City into a position where they will have to finish their last two games without their top two quarterbacks.\n\nChiefs are concerned that QB Gardner Minshew tore his ACL, as @mattderrick also reported. There will be additional tests but Minshew could be the second Chiefs’ quarterback in two games to tear his ACL. pic.twitter.com/vDVoxOTGKb\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) December 21, 2025\n\nTo add insult to (literal) injury, the Chiefs would end up losing the game to the Titans 26-9, handing Tennessee just their third win of the season in the process. Kansas City dropped to 6-9 overall with the loss, further worsening an already disappointing season for the Chiefs which still features an upcoming game with the AFC West leader and potential top AFC playoff seed the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe Chiefs will now turn to third-string quarterback Chris Oladokun, who starred in college at South Florida, Samford, and South Dakota State before being drafted in the seventh round of the 2022 NFL Draft by the Steelers before eventually landing in Kansas City.\n\nHe entered Sunday's loss to the Chiefs following the injury to Minshew, and completed his first career pass on a touchdown to Travis Kelce. He would finish the game 11-of-16 with 111 passing yards and two carries for seven yards, but it was not enough to help the Chiefs to victory.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Touchdown Wire: Brutal QB luck continues for Chiefs with Gardner Minshew injury",

    "fullText": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Carolina Panthers rookie safety Lathan Ransom has experienced the dramatic highs and lows of playing in the NFL in his first season.\n\nOne week after a crucial penalty that led to a costly loss to the New Orleans Saints, Ransom redeemed himself on Sunday by intercepting Baker Mayfield with 42 seconds left to seal the Panthers' 23-20 win over the Buccaneers — allowing Carolina to vault into sole possession of first place in the NFC South.\n\n“I faced a lot of adversity, and I heard noise from everybody last week,” Ransom said. “... (But) that’s how you shake back.”\n\nRansom couldn't have felt much worse last week on the flight home from New Orleans after he was flagged for hitting sliding Saints quarterback Tyler Shough with 9 seconds left on a bang-bang play. Officials flagged Ransom for unnecessary roughness, and the 15-yard penalty turned a difficult 61-yard field goal attempt into a far more makable one from 46 yards.\n\nCharlie Smyth put it through the uprights to complete the Saints' 20-17 come-from-behind win.\n\nHad the Panthers defeated the Saints, they would have only needed to beat the Bucs on Sunday to clinch the NFC South and end a seven-year playoff drought. Instead, the loss left the Panthers on the outside of the playoff bubble.\n\nRansom said he was hard on himself.\n\nBut the fourth-draft pick from Ohio State decided early last week that instead of dwelling on the mistake he'd use it as motivation.\n\n“I understand that the game is not won or lost by one play, but people behind their phone are going to have their own opinions,” Ransom said. “I just heard all the noise — listened to it and used it as fuel for this game.”\n\nRansom leaned on the support last week of veteran defensive leaders such as Jaycee Horn, Derrick Brown and Mike Jackson, who shares the locker next to him.\n\nJackson and others advised to look ahead, not back and keeping playing at full speed.\n\n“He responded like a grown man should,\" Jackson said. “At the end of day, everyone was talking trash to him, like he shouldn't be in the game and this and that. And today he responded like he should be. I'll just say I'm proud of him. Because at the end of the day it's grown man football and he showed that.”\n\nPanthers coach Dave Canales greeted Ransom on the sideline with a huge hug after interception, and smiled as he spoke about the rookie after the game.\n\n“That’s a great story,” Canales said. “That’s fantastic and it’s just about belief and having confidence in our guys to be able to be studs about the things we need to work on and be studs about the different decisions that come up. I love that for Lathan — for him to be able to make the winning play, the biggest play of the game for us.”\n\nThe Panthers will need more big plays from Ransom and other young players if they hope to dethrone the Buccaneers, who have won the last four NFC South titles.\n\nCarolina can clinch the division with a win next week against Seattle and a Tampa Bay loss to Miami. But if the Bucs win, it will come down to a rematch in Week 18 for the division title.\n\n“I’ve learned a bunch throughout the season, especially from that first game,” Ransom said. “You’re going to learn. It’s a learning process. You’re playing with the best of the best. I learn more and more every game and I try to take those teachings into the next game.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

    "description": "The Texans face the Raiders in Houston on Sunday. We break down what the game means for the NFL playoff picture in Week 16.",
    "fullText": "Game result: The Texans beat the Raiders, 23-21, in Week 16. Houston improves to 10-5 on the year and stays at the No. 7 seed in the AFC Playoff picture. Houston remains a game behind the Jacksonville Jaguars in the AFC South, who moved to 11-4 with their win over the Denver Broncos on Week 16.\n\nThe Houston Texans are closing in on a playoff berth, but it will be at least another week before they will have a clinching scenario. The Texans host the Las Vegas Raiders in Week 16 and this is a game they absolutely cannot lose.\n\nThe Texans are 9-5 and have won six straight in a streak that has included wins over the Jaguars, Bills, Colts, and Chiefs. They beat the Cardinals 40-20 last week. The Texans face a Raiders squad that is 2-12 and has lost eight straight games. Last week, the Raiders were thumped by the Eagles 31-0 in Philly.\n\nHouston is a 14.5-point favorite, which is the biggest spread of Week 16.\n\nThe Texans are in second place in the division sitting one game back of the Jaguars. Houston and Jacksonville split their season series and the Texans have a half game lead for the divisional tiebreaker (4-1 vs. 3-1). The Jaguars are traveling to face the Broncos this weekend, so if they lose that but win their two remaining games, the tiebreaker would go to record in common games.\n\nMeanwhile, the Colts sit a game back of the Texans and still has one game left with them. Houston won the first game in Week 13. The Colts need to see the Texans lose in Week 16 or 17 to create a situation in which the Colts can finish ahead of them.\n\nThe Texans are in seventh place and hold the final wild card spot ahead of the 8-6 Colts and 7-7 Ravens. If the Texans win and the Colts lose, Houston would have a wild card clinching scenario in Week 17 when they travel to face the Chargers. The Texans enter Week 16 with a 98% chance of making the playoffs at The Athletic’s playoff simulator. Houston has a 58% chance of claiming a wild card berth and a 40% chance of winning the division.\n\nThe Raiders are a common opponent for the Texans and Jaguars. There is a very real chance the Texans and Jaguars finish tied and it common opponents. They are also a common opponent with the Chargers, but Houston and LA will have a head-to-head tiebreaker sorted out when they meet in Week 17.",

(AP) — Bijan Robinson gained 171 yards from scrimmage and had a touchdown catch, Kirk Cousins threw two TD passes and ran for a score, and the Atlanta Falcons held on to beat the Arizona Cardinals 26-19 on Sunday.\n\nThe Falcons (6-9) won for the second straight week, with both coming on the road.\n\nArizona's defense made a fourth-down stop at its own 40-yard line with 2:05 left, setting up a chance to tie the game or take the lead, but Atlanta's C.J. Henderson made a diving interception of Jacoby Brissett's pass with 1:30 remaining to seal it.\n\nRobinson had 92 yards receiving on seven catches, including a 13-yard touchdown, and added 76 yards rushing on 16 carries. The 23-year-old became the third player in franchise history to gain at least 2,000 yards from scrimmage in a season, joining Jamal Anderson (1998) and William Andrews (1981 and 1983).\n\nArizona (3-12) has lost seven straight and 12 of 13 since starting the season 2-0.\n\nThe Falcons pushed ahead 26-16 early in the fourth quarter when Cousins scored on a 1-yard run, which capped a 12-play, 66-yard drive. Arizona cut the deficit to 26-19 with 4:37 left on Chad Ryland's 34-yard field goal, taking advantage of Cousins' fumble at midfield.\n\nBrissett completed 16 of 31 passes for 203 yards with a touchdown and an interception. The veteran has a 1-9 record as the Cardinals' starter since taking over for the injured Kyler Murray in Week 6.\n\nArizona tight end Elijah Higgins had 91 yards receiving on seven catches.\n\nAtlanta rallied from an early 10-point deficit to tie the game at 16-all heading into halftime. Cousins hit Kyle Pitts for an 11-yard touchdown with 25 seconds left in the second quarter. Calais Campbell, Arizona's 39-year-old defensive end, blocked the extra-point attempt to keep the Falcons from taking the lead.\n\nArizona tried a 50-yard field goal to take the lead just before the break, but Ryland's kick was no good, bouncing off the right upright.\n\nRyland also missed a 44-yard attempt in the third quarter wide right.\n\nThe Cardinals took a 10-0 lead midway through the first quarter after Michael Wilson made a circus catch for a 32-yard touchdown. Falcons cornerback Cobee Bryant and Wilson tumbled into the end zone as they fought for possession and the ball bounced between them, eventually settling between Wilson's legs without hitting the ground.\n\nCardinals: CB Max Melton (heel), LT Paris Johnson Jr. (knee) and S Jalen Thompson (hamstring) were among six inactives. ... CB Garrett Williams (Achilles tendon) left in the first quarter and had to be carted off the field after the non-contact injury. ...

Oh, and the Eagles also beat the Commanders — which eliminated the Chargers’ opponent this week, the Dallas Cowboys, from playoff contention. And heading into Sunday, we could see some big shifts in the AFC playoff picture.\n\nThe Broncos entered the week with the possibility of clinching the top AFC seed on the table. They needed to beat the Jaguars, and they needed the Chargers to beat the Cowboys to make it happen. The Chargers pulled it off, but the Jaguars shocked the Broncos with a 34-20 win.\n\nBut the most important shift we could still see in Week 16 is the Chargers clinching a playoff spot. That will happen with a win over the Cowboys, a box the Chargers checked, plus either a Texans loss to the Raiders (didn’t happen, though the Raiders made it a game) or a Colts loss to the 49ers on Monday Night Football.\n\nHere’s where the Chargers stand after the late afternoon slate, and the win over the Cowboys.\n\nDenver Broncos 12-3 (clinched playoff berth)",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers have struggled from three-point range this season, shooting 34.3%, 25th in the NBA.\n\nIn a 15-point loss last night against the Clippers, the Lakers shot an abysmal 16% from three (6-for-38). With Rui Hachimura and Deandre Ayton sidelined, Jake LaRavia entered the starting lineup.\n\nAlthough the fourth-year forward posted a double-double with 12 points, 11 rebounds and six assists, he continues to struggle from beyond the arc.\n\nLaRavia shot 0-for-4 from deep in what has been an inefficient shooting season. His 30.5% from deep is a career-low, after averaging a career-high 42.3% from beyond the arc last season.\n\nFollowing the game, LaRavia spoke on his shooting struggles, expecting to get back on track soon.  “I know I’m a good shooter, everyone on the staff knows I’m a good shooter, everyone on the team knows I’m a good shooter,” LaRavia said. “At some point, I have to make shots.

    "fullText": "The Jaguars faced off against the top team in the AFC, the Broncos, on Sunday in Denver. Jacksonville entered the week sitting at the top of the AFC South … but we did see some shakeups in the AFC playoff picture in Week 16 — and there may be more to come, including the Jaguars clinching the division.\n\nThe Broncos were also in position to clinch the AFC West with a win over the Jags, and a Chargers loss to the Cowboys, who were eliminated from NFC playoff contention with the Eagles’ win over the Commanders on Saturday and did lose to the Chargers on Sunday. Jacksonville played spoiler in an incredible road upset, blocking the Broncos’ path to the No. 1 seed in the AFC for now at least. The Broncos’ top-seed clinching scenario included the aforementioned Chargers loss that didn’t happen, plus a Patriots loss to the Ravens on Sunday Night Football (which seems possible at least) and a Bills loss to the Browns (which did not happen).\n\nThe Jaguars had two potential paths on Sunday to clinch the AFC South: A Texans loss to the Raiders (the Raiders kept it close, but ultimately added a ninth game to their losing streak) OR a Colts loss to the 49ers on Monday Night Football will solidify the Jags as the division winner. So we’ll see what happens when the Colts take on the 49ers on Monday.\n\nHere’s where things stand after the Jaguars’ massive win in Denver and the rest of the late afternoon slate of games. .\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nDenver Broncos 12-2 (clinched playoff berth)",

    "fullText": "ATLANTA (AP) — Trae Young is quickly returning to his All-Star form after missing 21 games with a knee injury.\n\nNow, the Atlanta Hawks can shift their focus to healing their ailing defense.\n\nThe Hawks ranked 22nd in scoring defense before Sunday's 152-150 loss to the Chicago Bulls in the NBA's highest-scoring game this season.\n\nThe Bulls had nine scorers in double figures, led by Matas Buzelis with 28 points. The Bulls' 152 points set a season high. They also set season highs with 41 assists, 57.6% field goal percentage and 47.6% 3-point shooting (20 of 42).\n\nYoung scored a season-high 35 points with nine assists. Jalen Johnson had 36 points with 11 rebounds and nine assists.\n\nThe Hawks also had Onyeka Okongwu score 23 points and Vit Krejci add 20. Young's encouraging showing and all the offense wasn't enough to overcome the leaky defense. The Bulls set another season high by scoring 83 points in the first half.\n\n“It’s kind of tough winning games when you give up 80 points in the first half,” Johnson said. “It’s kind of embarrassing in a sense. …. Hopefully we cut down on some of the things we’re doing.”\n\nThe Hawks (15-15) have lost three straight and seven of nine to fall back to .500.\n\nYoung started for the second time in three games after missing 21 games with a right MCL sprain.\n\n“I think everybody is excited to have Trae back,” Johnson said. “He’s been out for a while. ... The fact he’s found his rhythm already in his second game is a good sign.”\n\nCoach Quin Snyder said Young may need more time before he's ready to play back-to-back games.\n\nYoung logged 26 minutes against Chicago, which he said was his limit for his second game back.\n\n“I feel amazing,” Young said. “They did their job, put me right at 26 minutes. They weren’t allowing me to do any more. ... I feel great.”\n\nYoung led the NBA in assists last season and is a four-time All-Star. He scored only eight points in 20 minutes in his first game back, a 133-126 loss at Charlotte on Thursday night. He was back in his high-scoring form against Chicago but missed a last-second jumper that would have tied the game.\n\n“Those are shots that he makes,\" Snyder said. “You feel good about getting the ball in the right guy’s hands.”\n\nSnyder said the Hawks “had a lot of breakdowns in execution” on defense in the first half. The Bulls scored 69 points in the second half and made 54.3% of their shots from the field, but Snyder said his defense “did a better job with that in the second half as far as making them work hard.”\n\nYoung said the high-scoring pace was no surprise.\n\n“It’s how both teams play,” Young said. \"Both teams play fast. Teams are coming in here and playing fast against us. We’ve got to figure out how to stop a team that can only play fast.'\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

    "description": "Trevon Diggs has come clean about how his October concussion. He also acknowledges that he is uncertain if he'll stay on with the Cowboys in 2026.",
    "fullText": "After two months of rampant speculation and mysterious silence on the subject, Cowboys cornerback has finally given an explanation for how he got a concussion back in mid-October, an incident that kickstarted his latest string of eight missed games.\n\nHis version of events, however, may not do much to quiet the calls for Dallas to cut ties with him.\n\nThe two-time Pro Bowler himself acknowledged that Sunday's loss may have been his final game at AT&T Stadium in a Cowboys uniform.\n\nIn the days leading up to the 2025 home finale versus the Chargers, NFL insider Jane Slater reported that Diggs had shared with her how he got the concussion. She classified his explanation then as \"far less nefarious than some of the rumors\" that had been circulating online.\n\nAfter Sunday's 34-17 loss to Los Angeles, Slater shared- with Diggs's permission- that Diggs says he took a hit to the head while trying to install a TV from his ceiling. The pole mount, he said, fell on his head.\n\n\"I was trying to be a handyman,\" he reportedly told her.\n\nPer Slater, Diggs \"didn't think it was a big deal and didn't need to be addressed but speculation on the internet went way too far.\"\n\nSome of you wanted to know how Trevon Diggs got concussed. It was never that crazy but the lack of answers made it sound like it was. With his permission he shared and here’s the video of it.\n\nHe says a tv he was trying to install from the ceiling with the pole mount fell on his… pic.twitter.com/3ooFFZFWDb\n\n— Jane Slater (@SlaterNFL) December 21, 2025\n\nDiggs reportedly came to the Cowboys facility on Oct. 16 exhibiting concussion symptoms. He was declared out for the team's Week 7 contest versus Washington. The team moved him to injured reserve after that game, but reported the cause as a knee issue. He sat out longer than the mandated three games and was only elevated to the active roster this past Saturday, the final day of his evaluation window.\n\nDiggs and the Cowboys were at odds for some time over why he wasn't back in the lineup sooner. Diggs had been claiming that he was fully healthy and ready to return; owner Jerry Jones disputed that, based on what he had exhibited in practice. Head coach Brian Schottenheimer alluded to consistency issues that had more to do with Diggs's all-around behavior.\n\nNow pressed into service for the final three games due in large part to DaRon Bland's move to injured reserve, Diggs is faced with the possibility of being irreparably on the outs with the team that gave him a $97 million contract just two years ago.\n\n\"Yeah, possibly,\" he told reporters after the loss Sunday. \"If this is my last [home] game with the Cowboys, it's tough.\"\n\nDiggs got the start on Sunday in place of Bland. And while he was in on six tackles on the day, he was also notably the closest defender on a 25-yard second-quarter touchdown throw to Ladd McConkey and was repeatedly targeted by Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert, who threw for 300 yards and two touchdowns and finished with a spectacular passer rating of 132.8.\n\nDespite the rollercoaster of drama that has marked his difficult 2025 season, Diggs has said he wants to return to Dallas next year.\n\n\"After the season, I guess we'll figure it out.\"\n\nTodd is on X at @ToddBrock24f7.

    "fullText": "Despite a sloppy start, UConn men’s basketball moved to 2-0 in the Big East with a convincing road win over DePaul in Chicago. While the Huskies (12-1, 2-0 Big East) looked out of sorts in the first half without star guard Solo Ball, they snapped out of it just in time to cruise to a comfortable 72-54 win.\n\nBall was surprisingly listed as inactive, ruled out with a wrist injury suffered after a hard fall in the conference opener against Butler on Tuesday. With Ball out, Jaylin Stewart returned to the starting lineup.\n\nThe Huskies were entirely out of sorts early on, turning it over six times in the first eight minutes alone, leading to 12 DePaul points.\n\nThe home team led for most of the start of the first half, up by as much as eight with 10:54 to play after Layden Blocker capped off a 7-0 run with a layup to lead 15-7. But Silas Demary Jr. and Alex Karaban did everything in their power to keep things from getting too out of hand. Demary Jr. helped UConn punch back, scoring five-straight points as part of a 9-0 run to give the Huskies their first lead of the night.\n\nUConn would take the lead for good off a nifty reverse layup from Jaylin Stewart with 6:17 left to play, and Karaban and Demary helped stretch the lead to as much as five in the first half, combining for a 5-0 run in the final minutes before a Blocker buzzer beater cut the halftime lead to three.\n\nKaraban was a much-needed stabilizing force throughout the entire first 20 minutes, scoring 10 points on a perfect 6-6 shooting from the field. He scored five of UConn’s first seven points as the offense sputtered out of the gate, and stretched the floor effectively with two 3-pointers. Demary Jr. started out on pace for a shot at another triple-double with seven points, five assists, and six boards in just the first half alone.\n\nDespite only really being able to lean on those two and coughing up the ball 13 times for 16 Blue Demons points, UConn managed to lead 33-30 at the break after arguably its worst half of the season.\n\nThe Huskies looked revitalized after halftime and came out hot, scoring four quick points to go up seven. With the offense back on track, UConn rattled off a 12-2 run capped off with a Braylon Mulins jumper to lead 52-36 with 11:53 to play. The Huskies’ defense tightened the clamps on the Blue Demons in the second half, with DePaul scoring just eight points in the first 10 minutes of the final period.\n\nWith the defense humming and the offense back on track, UConn stretched the lead to as much as 17 after a putback from Tarris Reed Jr. made it 58-41 with just under eight minutes to play. The Blue Demons did make one last attempt to get back in it by cutting the lead to 10 with four minutes to play, but a Reed fadeaway jumper off the glass extended the lead back to 12.\n\nOn the next possession, Karaban walled up and altered a DePaul shot on the block, then found Mullins for a three on the next possession to put the game away for good. Mullins would hit one more three-pointer the next time down for the cherry on top and finished the night with eight points.\n\nKaraban led all scorers with 21 points, and added six rebounds, two assists, and a block. Reed Jr. posted his second double-double of the season with 14 points and 11 boards, and added four assists and three blocks. Demary Jr., who appeared to be under the weather, flirted with a triple-double and finished with 14 points, seven assists, eight rebounds, two blocks, and a steal.\n\nUConn now embarks on a 10-day break for the holidays, with the Huskies returning to action on New Year’s Eve with a road game against Xavier. Tip-off against the Musketeers is set for 5:00 p.m. ET, with the game set to be broadcast on NBC Sports and available to stream on Peacock.",

    "fullText": "Baker Mayfield's game-ending INT sums up Buccaneers' freefall perfectly originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers' form in the second half of the season has been horrible, and the ending to the 23-20 loss to the Carolina Panthers perhaps perfectly encapsulates that.\n\nWith the Buccaneers at the Panthers' 42-yard line and just about in field goal range, facing a second-and-nine, the offense could have picked up a few yards and been in good shape.\n\nBut Baker Mayfield threw a game-ending interception. Mike Evans was the target, and when he got to the top of his route, he cut inside, Baker threw it outside, and the rest is history.\n\nHead coach Todd Bowles stated it looked like a simple miscommunication.\n\nYeah, unfortunately it was,\" Mayfield said. \"I was trying to find a lane to step through and make the throw to him, and he thought I was going to scramble, which, based on some of the scrambles earlier to that, you can't blame him. It's just honestly, just sucky situation.\"\n\nMore:Why Buccaneers fans might not like Todd Bowles' message after Panthers loss\n\nFor a team that has lost six of its last seven games, you would think no.\n\nBut this NFL season has been odd.\n\nAnd as such, if the Buccaneers win their last two games, on the road against the Miami Dolphins and then the next installment of the Panthers rivalry at home, then Bowles' team would punch its ticket to the postseason.\n\nBut based on how the Bucs have played over the last month, there is nothing guaranteed in the final two weeks.\n\nMayfield and Evans being on the wrong page with the game on the line doesn't happen often, and in the biggest moment, they had their wires crossed.\n\nNFC South standings: How Panthers' Week 16 win over Buccaneers impacts division race, playoff picture\n\nBuccaneers playoff picture: Updated chances for Tampa Bay to make 2025 NFL postseason after Week 16 loss to Panthers\n\nIs Emeka Egbuka playing today?

    "description": "The Arizona Cardinals lost for the 12th time this season, falling by a score of 26-19 to the Atlanta Falcons in front of a thin home crowd at State Farm...",
    "fullText": "The Arizona Cardinals lost for the 12th time this season, falling by a score of 26-19 to the Atlanta Falcons in front of a thin home crowd at State Farm Stadium. Arizona’s overall effort was a mixed bag, but injuries truly began to pile up as a brutal season continued trending in a dismal direction. With two games remaining (one against a Los Angeles Rams team desperate to win the division), there’s little hope to see another game in the win column this season.\n\nArizona did finally play a close game for the first time in multiple weeks. Although it did come down to the final drive, it was another game that felt ugly, disjointed and tough to watch. While injuries have been pointed to as a culprit of this particularly poor season, Sunday’s bout of maladies may carry impact into 2026.\n\nThe Cardinals’ offense was able to run the ball better than most efforts this season. For what felt like the first time in many weeks, Arizona put up 100-plus yards on the ground. A combination of Michael Carter, Corey Kiner and Emari Demercado were finally able to find some running room, combining for 127 yards on 22 carries — a rate of just over 5.7 yards per carry.\n\nUnfortunately, the passing attack that has been quite lethal in terms of overall volume production was nearly silent. QB Jacoby Brissett struggled, managing to complete just 16 of his 31 passes for 203 yards and one score. There were some key drops, but Brissett’s accuracy felt erratic.\n\nTE trey McBride was held to just 27 yards on four receptions, and the Cardinals’ leading receiver was backup TE Elijah Higgins.\n\nDefensively, Arizona managed two turnovers. Their defensive front was able to get pressure on an immobile Kirk Cousins. DL Darius Robinson had an excellent game with seven tackles, a TFL, a pass defended and a fumble recovery. CB Will Johnson locked up Falcons WR Drake London one-on-one. In some ways, it might have been considered a mild bounce-back performance — if not for the fact that star RB Bijan Robinson collected 168 total yards and a touchdown.\n\nIt was the type of effort one can expect from a team that has now lost seven straight. While the final score was ultimately close, it never felt that the Cardinals — after holding a 16-10 lead late in the first half — had a chance to put together enough offense to stay ahead of Atlanta.\n\nBut the most brutal reality of Sunday’s game is a tough one to accept. In a game that meant nothing in terms of standings or the playoff picture, Arizona lost multiple high-level contributors to injury.\n\nOLB Josh Sweat was helped off the field with an ankle injury. C Hjalte Froholdt suffered an elbow injury. Even the ironclad Budda Baker had to exit the game for a concussion evaluation, though he did eventually return.\n\nBut two of the Cardinals’ biggest defensive contributors suffered more concerning injuries. CB Garrett Williams left the game after a non-contact incident, and was quickly ruled out with an achilles injury — words that ring ominous to his availability next season. And DL Walter Nolen III, who had not struggled with injuries in his football career prior to 2025, left on the cart, visibly emotional with a knee injury.\n\nIt’s one thing to lose games. In fact, many would likely prefer to see the Cardinals’ draft stock increase. But to watch some of the more promising players on this defense leave with injuries of the non-contact variety is, somehow, the only way to make this brutal season a worse experience for loyal Cardinals fans.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Denver Broncos had not lost a game since September 21. That changed on Sunday, when the Jacksonville Jaguars strolled into Empower Field and handed them a 34-20 defeat.\n\nThe loss tightens things up on the AFC playoff race as the Broncos are now just one game ahead of the Los Angeles Chargers in the AFC West and could be tied with the New England Patriots for the No. 1 overall seed, depending on what happens in New England's Sunday night tilt with the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nThe story of this game was much more about what Jacksonville did right than what Denver did wrong. The Jags were efficient on offense, moving the ball well against Denver's vaunted defense and cashing in against the league's best red-zone defense.\n\nTrevor Lawrence, coming off the best game of his career last week, had another gem on Sunday, completing 23 of 36 passes for 279 yards with three touchdowns. Parker Washington had 145 yards receiving on six catches, forcing several missed tackles throughout the contest.\n\nThe Broncos had their chances to respond to the big shots being delivered by the Jaguars, but two second-half turnovers by Bo Nix knocked the Broncos out.\n\nThe Jaguars continued their historically good play in the Mile High City and now have a winning record of 5-4 all-time there. With the win, Jacksonville improves to 11-4 on the season, still very much in the race for the No. 1 overall seed and home-field advantage in the playoffs.\n\nREAD: 4 2026 offensive NFL Draft targets who could wind up with Denver Broncos\n\nThe Broncos won't have much time to sit and sulk over this loss as they will be back on the field on Christmas night at Arrowhead Stadium against the sputtering Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nBroncos vs. Jaguars Series History: Teams will meet for 16th time in Week 16\n\n5 Denver Broncos players who will not be with the team in 2026\n\nBroncos get two players returns in Week 16, including one who hasn't played in two years\n\nFormer Pro Bowl wide receiver makes huge claim for Denver Broncos this season\n\nDenver Broncos give clear sign that key offensive starter will return to action in Week 16",

The seven-point underdog Steelers did San Francisco a favor by upsetting the Lions 29-24 while the 49ers sat in Indianapolis awaiting their Monday night showdown with the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nThe 49ers clinched thanks to the NFL's tiebreaking procedures.\n\nSan Francisco's maximum losses is seven, and Detroit on Sunday suffered their seventh defeat. The Lions are the only other team in the NFC that can reach 10 wins. At worst the 49ers could finished tied with the Lions at 10-7.\n\nSince they didn't play head-to-head this season, the tiebreaking procedure moves to best record in conference games. The Lions are 5-5 within the NFC while the 49ers are sitting at 8-2. With only two games left against NFC opponents, the 49ers have clinched a better conference record than Detroit.\n\nClinching a playoff spot doesn't mean the 49ers will be in cruise control the rest of the way, however. They can still earn the NFC's No. 1 seed and a first-round bye if they win their final three games against the Colts, Chicago Bears and Seattle Seahawks.\n\nA win over the Colts will clinch a top-six seed for the 49ers since the Green Bay Packers fell to the Chicago Bears on Saturday and dropped to 9-6-1, meaning their maximum number of wins would be 10, and one shy of the 11 the 49ers would reach with a win Monday night.\n\nThe 49ers and Colts are slated to kick off at 5:15pm Pacific Time on Monday.\n\nMore 49ers: Kyle Shanahan blames 49ers WR for not reaching $500,000 incentive yet\n\nThis article originally appeared on Niners Wire: San Francisco 49ers clinch playoff spot after Steelers upset Lions",

    "fullText": "The Detroit Lions' 2025 NFL playoff hopes were just crushed.\n\nNeeding a victory to virtually keep their postseason hopes alive, the Lions came up short at Ford Field on Sunday, Dec. 21, against the Pittsburgh Steelers, losing the Week 16 game, 29-24.\n\nThe Lions will be eliminated if the Packers win either of their final two games against the Baltimore Ravens or Minnesota Vikings.\n\nIt was an ugly and uninspired performance, especially with the season on the line, despite a late comeback effort.\n\nBIG STORY: Lions fan says DK Metcalf swung at him after he used star's full name\n\nThe Lions took a 10-3 lead on an impressive 20-yard touchdown catch from rookie Isaac TeSlaa with 1:55 left in the first half, but it was all down hill from there. The Steelers went 80 yards and scored on a miracle TD with two seconds left before the break when running back Kenneth Gainwell made an impressive catch through contact, fell down but wasn't touched by linebacker Alex Anzalone and ran into the end zone to tie the game.\n\nThe momentum carried into the third quarter. The Lions ran just three plays in the period, tied for the fewest in a quarter for any team this season, according to the CBS broadcast, and one of those plays was a safety when Goff took a sack in the end zone.\n\nThe Lions were dominated in nearly every facet, particularly in the second half, but the real difference was on the ground. The Steelers rushed for 230 yards and broke two 45-yard TD runs in the fourth quarter, while the Lions rushed for just 15 yards.\n\nOutside of the massive playoff implications, one of the biggest stories of the day took place in the stands. Steelers star wide receiver DK Metcalf got into an altercation with a Lions fan who was leaning over the ledge to talk with him and Metcalf took a swing at him.\n\nMetcalf was not ejected from the game as officials did not see the play and thus couldn't throw a flag, meaning he couldn't be thrown out.\n\n“There was no flag on the field, so New York cannot weigh in with regard to a potential disqualification,” the NFL said in a statement.\n\nMetcalf had a quiet day, finishing with four catches for just 42 yards.\n\nDave Birkett covers the Lions for the Detroit Free Press.

This is a second marriage for both of us and we each came into the marriage with three kids who are now between 32 and 40. Two of his three kids are estranged. We have no kids together. My husband is retired and I’m semi-retired. We have 9 grandkids, plus a few step-grandkids.",

    "description": "To prevent ramming attacks at Christmas markets, German officials have installed concrete blocks, chain barriers and, in one case, metal bollards removed by a hand-cranked crane.",
    "fullText": "Reporting from the Christmas market in Augsburg, Germany.\n\nFor as long as anyone can remember, the highlight of the annual Christmas market in Augsburg, a wealthy 2,000-year-old city in southern Germany, was the magnificent Christmas tree at the market’s center.\n\nThis year, the most popular attractions are the removable security bollards at the market’s edge, newly installed to prevent cars ramming into the holiday crowds.\n\nOn a recent December afternoon, half a dozen captivated bystanders stood around three of these mundane-looking posts. Wielding their cellphones, most of them were filming municipal employees as they used a hand-cranked crane to remove the 770-pound bollards every time a tram needed to pass through. During rush hour, that involved removing the bollards roughly once a minute.\n\n“These things are terrible,” said Hannelore Hendrick, 67, a rare bystander who did not take out her phone. “They remind me of the dangers of being here.”\n\nFor centuries, Christmas markets have appeared in town squares across Germany during Advent, bringing a sense of community, tradition and seasonal cheer to the darkest days of the central European year. Augsburg’s Christmas market has been held in the city for more than half a millennium, with the only documented breaks occurring during World War II and the coronavirus pandemic. Revelers can buy mulled wine, steak buns and Christmas decorations from brightly decorated wooden kiosks.\n\nThis year, the carefree spirit of the country’s roughly 3,200 Christmas markets has been somewhat dimmed. Security at these markets has been a national concern since 2016, when a man steered a stolen truck into crowds in Berlin. Ever since, municipal officials across Germany have tried to prevent further attacks by encircling markets with barriers.\n\nNow, officials are taking things a step further after another attack last December in Magdeburg, eastern Germany, which highlighted a flaw in the existing security measures. A man plowed a rented S.U.V. into the crowds there, killing six and injuring hundreds, after squeezing the car through a narrow gap in the barriers that had been left open for emergency vehicles. To fix that problem 12 months later, the authorities in various cities have blocked such gaps with police vans, metal gates and concrete blocks.\n\nAugsburg, where trams run through the protected zone, is unique in installing bollards that need to be moved hundreds of times a day. The contraption is so unwieldy that it has become a national symbol of the new security environment, attracting attention across Germany.\n\nThe mechanism first became famous through social media in late November, prompting coverage from the national news networks. Eventually, a well-known televised comedy show made a segment about it, leading to the charge that the city might be overdoing it, or doing it wrong.\n\nAugsburg’s mayor, Eva Weber, insists that securing the market is worth a few late-night quips.\n\n“It’s better for people to laugh at Augsburg than for people to cry with Augsburg,” she said in an interview.\n\nOn a recent visit, I found the security crews hard at work, at one point moving the crane roughly once a minute, attaching the bollard to a hook, whirling the crane’s handles to lift the bollard, and then pushing the whole contraption out of the way of waiting trams.\n\nOnce each tram passed, the workers reversed the whole procedure — to the amusement of a small crowd of onlookers.\n\n“At least they don’t need to go the gym,” said Elke Noll, 58, smiling at the physical effort required to make it work.\n\nComic though the system was, no one I met was opposed to its installation. Reinhold Hohenögger, 59, who has sold metal signs at the market for a decade, said that many of his friends no longer come there for fear of attacks. Lena Beuerle, 23, who was drinking mulled wine with her friends, said that while they can still get into the Christmas spirit, they have become more vigilant as they move through the market.\n\nA national poll last month found that 62 percent of respondents were at least somewhat worried about attacks on Christmas markets; only 35 percent said they weren’t worried at all.\n\nThe city is spending roughly 50,000 euros, or $58,000, to secure the Christmas market, according to Ms. Weber, the mayor. That cost includes the wages of a six-person crew that staffs two sets of bollards and cranes for more than 60 hours a week. And it is a small fraction of the estimated million euros that the little market earns each year, she said.\n\n“It would be reckless not to consider how large events can be protected,” said Ms. Weber.\n\nThough the barriers have their critics, some vendors at the market think the eccentric system has helped to attract more visitors to the market. “We are definitely getting more people than last year — and it’s not just Germans but people coming from abroad too,” said Sina Hefele, 21, who sells Christmas-tree-shaped ornaments at a booth a few yards away from the bollards.\n\n“If you want people to come,” said Mr. Hohenögger, the seller of metal signs, “you have to show them that you have thought about security measures.”",

    "fullText": "400-Mile-Long Fog Blankets California For Weeks\n\nPretty much everyone feels like they see endless gray skies in winter, but California’s Central Valley is taking things a step further with three weeks of foggy conditions from a phenomenon called \"tule fog.\"\n\nSatellite imagery from NASA and CIRA has revealed how pervasive the fog has been for the region, with day-after-day and week-after-week fogginess never letting up.\n\nThe fog started to develop on Nov. 22 and was firmly in place by Nov. 24 — and it's pretty much been there ever since (though it has grown and shrunk a little on a day-to-day basis).\n\nSoil in the Central Valley has been nice and moist following a rainy autumn.\n\nIn fact, precipitation totals from September through November ranked among the top 10% wettest on record for most of central and southern California. Modesto and Hanford, California, each broke the record for the wettest meteorological fall since records began.\n\nSo we have moist air for the equation.\n\nIn late November, a stable high-pressure system developed over California, helping to trap all of that moisture.\n\nThe fog layer has kept things cool in the valley as the rest of the Southwest has been basking in above-average temperatures.\n\nNow we have our temperature inversion.\n\nIs the end coming soon? Until a storm comes in to clear out the moist air, there's no anticipated end to the foggy conditions. The National Weather Service in Hanford, California, is warning of fog at least through Friday of this week.\n\nSara Tonks is a content meteorologist with weather.com and has a bachelor’s and a master’s degree from Georgia Tech in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences along with a master’s degree from Unity Environmental University in Marine Science.",

    "fullText": "With street lights out and wireless data limited, the Waymo vehicles were causing backups across the city.\n\nWith street lights out and wireless data limited, the Waymo vehicles were causing backups across the city.\n\nA power outage struck San Francisco on Saturday that blacked out about 130,000 customers at its peak, according to Pacific Gas and Electric Company, but also caused another problem: stranded Waymo vehicles. Posts all over social media showed the company’s autonomous SUVs sitting still in the streets and causing traffic jams.\n\nSome people posted videos of Teslas using their FSD feature to navigate the same streets, and Elon Musk tweeted that “Tesla Robotaxis were unaffected by the SF power outage.”\n\nIn response to an inquiry from The Verge, Waymo spokesperson Suzanne Philion sent a statement saying, “We have temporarily suspended our ride-hailing services given the broad power outage in San Francisco. We are focused on keeping our riders safe and ensuring emergency personnel have the clear access they need to do their work.” PG&E reported as of 7AM PT that “Crews have restored about 110,000 customers and PG&E continues to work on restoring the remaining 21,000 customers, primarily in the Presidio, Richmond District, Golden Gate Park and small areas of downtown San Francisco,” as it continued repairs after a fire at a five-story power substation.\n\nExactly why the cars weren’t moving remains unclear, with no public updates we could find on the company’s social media channels, but speculation centered on spotty wireless data connections, with cell towers either down or overloaded by people who no longer had access to Wi-Fi, and/or the street lights that weren’t operating without power.\n\nThese problems have occurred before, though, as seen in TikTok videos from earlier this year showing Waymos frozen by a malfunctioning street light and during a power outage in Austin, Texas. In a reply to a Reddit post showing another similar situation last year, someone saying they were a former employee commented explaining that the vehicle would send a request to a remote assistant and wait for their response before proceeding.\n\nAccording to a company blog post, it reaches out to a human response agent when the car encounters “unique interactions,” providing them with live and recorded views from its cameras in addition to a 3D map of what the sensors are picking up. However, those may require bandwidth that’s hard to find during a significant power outage. I couldn’t find any statistics on how many remote assistance operators Waymo has available at a given time, but in November, the company announced it passed a third-party audit by Tüv Süd, a German tech inspection company that evaluated its remote assistance program against industry best practices.",

    "description": "From Denny's breakfasts to hotel gift exchanges, we turned my pilot husband's flight schedule into creative, meaningful holiday memories.",
    "fullText": "There is so much pressure on women to make the holidays perfect for everyone. I had to accept the fact that I was unable to provide the consistent traditions that I enjoyed as a child. Instead, I learned to create memories while my pilot husband flew during the holidays.\n\nWith my husband's flight schedule, holidays never looked traditional or perfectly planned. There were tears, and some years were harder than others. As hard as some of those years were, they became the memories we still talk about and cherish today.\n\nI grew up with consistent holiday traditions. My grandparents visited on Christmas Eve. We ate together, opened gifts, and my great-grandmother played the piano. I would struggle to sleep, but I would wake up to gifts with my parents and my brother. After the chaos of gift opening, we would take a drive to see my other grandparents and eat, and then open presents. Like clockwork, I knew what to expect every year.\n\nI knew my husband would work holidays when we married. Living with that reality was more difficult than I expected. I missed the comfort of my childhood traditions. I felt sad that my kids wouldn't share those same experiences. My dream of creating consistent family traditions was not going to happen. I could fight it and cry, or I could find ways to make the holidays fun and meaningful, no matter the date on the calendar.\n\nOne Christmas, while he was flying, the kids and I spent Christmas morning at a Denny's coloring. We colored pages for my grandmother, who was living in an assisted living facility. We packed our artwork and picked up some holiday treats from home. Then, we drove over for a surprise visit on Christmas morning. We had already opened gifts with her, but this was a special visit. My grandfather had passed, and she was alone. Her memory was fading, and she spent a lot of time in her little apartment. Her face lit up when we walked into the room. We spent the morning looking through old photos. She hung up the pictures the kids had brought over, and we walked around the facility saying hi to the residents. Spending Christmas morning with her is a memory that I'll cherish forever.\n\nThat Christmas morning at Denny's, I saw it for the first time. This wasn't about loss or compromise. Every year, my kids experienced something new and special. This was different from my traditional upbringing. That one Christmas morning with my grandmother, I saw the opportunity. The opportunity to provide my kids with something different and unique every year.\n\nThe following year, his schedule was even worse. He was flying over Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and even a few days after Christmas. That year was tough to prepare for. We decided to celebrate Christmas on the 28th. This was tough. Kids count down to a specific date all year, only to hear that they have to wait even longer. By a stroke of luck, he had a schedule change and was able to drive home, and we woke the kids up at midnight. We opened gifts, laughed, ate treats, and went back to bed. The next morning, he drove back to the airport for his Christmas Day flight.\n\nAs the kids got older, we would anxiously wait for his schedule so that we could plan our Christmas. One year, we took a last-minute cruise, came home to open gifts, and then saw him off for his Christmas Day flights.\n\nOne year, his overnight was close enough that we were able to load up some presents and drive to his hotel. We spent the day as a family. We saw a movie, ate at a restaurant, opened presents, and then the kids and I drove home.\n\nThis holiday season will be the last with my husband flying, as he retires next year. Even though he will now be home, we will always have a unique way of celebrating.",

    "fullText": "Costco endlessly mixes up its merchandise mix, offering everything from big-name retailers to its well-regarded Kirkland Signature house brand.\n\nPart of the joy of the brand is its treasure hunt model, where members never know exactly what to expect. I might visit my local warehouse needing toothbrushes, some coffee, and maybe dress socks, then leave with a canoe or a giant teddy bear.\n\nCostco Founder Jim Sinegal explained the magic of the chain's model.\n\n\"We have created a Treasure Hunt atmosphere. When customers come in, they may find at one time we have a Coach handbag, and they come back, and we don’t have the Coach handbag, but perhaps we have some Levi’s we are selling at a hot price,\" he told Masters Invest.\n\nIt's all about making members feel the need to not miss out.\n\n\"We try to create a sense of urgency, that if you see the product, you’d better buy it because chances are it won’t be there next time. We purposely run out of merchandise to create that sense of urgency in our customers,” he added.\n\nNow, current Costco CEO Ron Vachris has shared some new big-name retail partnerships that the warehouse club will use to drive sales.\n\nThe treasure hunt model powers the Costco brand.\n\n\"Costco’s 'treasure hunt' shopping experience has become one of the most iconic and influential pieces of modern retail psychology. Customers walk through the warehouse expecting not only value but surprise. This element of discovery — the possibility of finding an unexpected deal, an unusually high-quality brand, or a limited-time item — is a cornerstone of Costco’s business strategy,\" shared Mojo Sales and Strategy.\n\nThe warehouse club, way back in Sinegal's days, knew how to drive human behaviour.\n\n\"It is not accidental. It is engineered psychology, and when understood correctly, it becomes a powerful tool for vendors who want to thrive inside Costco’s ecosystem,\" Mojo Sales and Strategy added.\n\nThe treasure-hunt concept is built on the behavioral principle that people are motivated by variability.\n\nCostco sees major shift in member behavior\n\nRetail chain shuts all locations as legal changes hit industry\n\nLululemon struggles to reverse concerning customer behavior\n\nT-Mobile launches free offer for customers after major loss\n\nCostco has continued to add to that variability by surprising members by adding new items from big brands.\n\n\"We added a number of new national brand partnerships across a range of non-food categories in Q1, including Gap and Ulta gift cards, Vera Bradley apparel, and Upper Deck trading cards,\" shared CFO Gary Millerchip during the chain's first-quarter earnings call.",

    "description": "Karen Gilchrist jokes that her \"maternal instincts kicked in late,\" but by 2024 she and her husband, Pablo Slough, decided to prioritize family over climbing the corporate ladder.",
    "fullText": "Over two decades of working in demanding roles managing teams around the world had taken a toll.\n\n\"I worked straight out of college, and then it was one job to the other job,\" Slough, 53, told Business Insider. \"It was always fast-paced, high stress.\"\n\nFor Gilchrist, turning 50 last summer drove her to reflect about how she'd spent her time and what she wanted to do moving forward.\n\n\"I joke sometimes that my maternal instincts kicked in late,\" Gilchrist told Business Insider. \"But it felt like the right moment to dedicate more time to my family than to work and climbing the corporate ladder.\"\n\nTheir oldest son, Luka, 18, is in his senior year and plans to head off to college in the fall. The other two, Mateo, 15, and Joaquin, 12, aren't far behind.\n\nTaking a gap year would give the couple a chance to step away from work, travel with their kids, and figure out their next steps.\n\nBut they didn't jump in immediately. The couple, based in Boulder, Colorado, hired a financial advisor a year in advance to make sure the plan was financially feasible.\n\n\"We also decided that we're going to rent our house out while we're traveling, so we could get some income,\" Slough said.\n\nAs their plans to quit became more concrete, the couple talked through everything with their kids. Funnily enough, it was their sons who seemed unsure at first.\n\n\"We were a bit surprised that our parents would actually do it because they have always been very focused on their careers,\" their second son, Mateo, told Business Insider.\n\nBut one of the reasons the couple wanted to do this was to show their kids that life isn't just about work, Gilchrist said.\n\n\"It's about life. It's about balancing things. It's about family,\" she said, adding that they hoped the experience would show their kids that life doesn't always have to follow a fixed path.\n\nThe couple considered it a career break, but the plan was not to travel the whole time.\n\n\"We didn't want to disrupt school,\" Slough said. \"So we just thought we'll come back for school, and then whatever free time we have, we'll travel.\"\n\nThe family spent the summer of 2024 traveling around Europe, a trip planned around their eldest son's three-week business course at a university in Barcelona.\n\nTheir travels began in Turkey, before they hopped on a cruise through Greece, Croatia, Malta, and Montenegro. After dropping their son off for his program, they explored Spain and Portugal before reuniting and heading to Colombia. They were back in Colorado a week before school started.\n\nThis year, their summer took them to Asia, with stops in Hong Kong, several cities in Thailand, Vietnam, China, and finally Japan.\n\n\"We all wanted to go to Asia, so we were really excited about it,\" Luka, their oldest son, told Business Insider.\n\nTo budget for their trips, the couple created an Excel sheet to track their daily expenses.\n\n\"We had an average spend per day that we wanted to aim for. It meant that in some places, we splurged because we wanted a really nice hotel. And in other places, we were a little bit more frugal,\" Gilchrist said, adding that they would update their expenses in real time to see if they were within their budget.\n\nLooking back on the trips, the family says they loved every moment.\n\n\"It felt like our parents were more present and flexible with us,\" Joaquin, their youngest, told Business Insider. \"We also learned more about each other's preferences, from the experiences and foods we enjoy to how each of us likes to spend our free time.\"\n\nDuring the months they weren't traveling, the couple spent their time at home doing things they rarely had time for before, such as exercising together, reading, and going to the movies every week.\n\n\"Now, we have this objective of cooking something completely new every day,\" Gilchrist said.\n\nThe couple says they feel less stressed, sleep better, and have genuinely enjoyed spending more time together.\n\n\"We're like, 'OK, we're going to be together all day long. What is that going to look like?' And truthfully, I think it's been amazing,\" Gilchrist said.\n\nBut the biggest benefit of taking time away from work has been having the space to reflect on what they wanted to do next, Slough said. He started teaching three days a week at a local university.\n\n\"It's something I've always wanted to do,\" Slough said. \"And then it just happened to come my way.\"\n\nHad he been working full-time, taking up this offer would have been out of the question, he said.\n\nThey also realized they didn't have to return to their corporate jobs to live comfortably. They could earn a portion of what they once made and still maintain their lifestyle.\n\nWorking with a financial advisor helped them identify areas where they were overspending and set a goal to cut their regular expenses by 30%. Before that, the couple had never closely tracked their finances.\n\n\"We were spending so much that we thought we needed really high-paying jobs to be able to continue,\" Slough said.\n\nKyle D. Dennehy, a financial advisor at California Financial Advisor who wasn't involved in the couple's planning, told Business Insider that the first step in preparing for a career break is to create a detailed budget that outlines all income sources, expenses, and savings goals.\n\n\"Once you have your 'normal' budget, estimate how each specific category will shift during an adult gap year, but keep your long-term goal savings like retirement contributions included in the gap year budget,\" Dennehy said.\n\nOnce the difference between the regular and new budgets is clear, a plan can be created to regularly contribute toward the updated savings goal, Dennehy said.\n\nNow, the couple is exploring whether to buy and run a small local business rather than slip back into corporate jobs. Gilchrist said they might never have considered entrepreneurship without the break.\n\n\"We joke, and we say that this time has also been a research and development phase for us on, 'OK, what does being productive over the next 10, 20 years look like?'\" Gilchrist said.\n\nOf course, there are risks that come with taking an extended career break, but careful financial planning has helped them manage those uncertainties.\n\n\"Plan it properly. It can't just be like, 'Oh, I quit my job this weekend, and we're going to travel for a year.' It will not work,\" Slough said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about taking a career break?

    "description": "As iRobot's founder Colin Angle looks back on its path to bankruptcy, he says it was hard to overcome competitors in China.",
    "fullText": "If there's one lesson iRobot founder Colin Angle took from the company's bankruptcy, it's never to underestimate competitors.\n\nOn December 14, iRobot, maker of the popular robotic vacuum Roomba, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and will be acquired by its primary contract manufacturer, Chinese company Picea Robotics.\n\nAngle said one of his biggest takeaways as iRobot enters its next phase is that even market leaders must remain alert to competition from China.\n\n\"It's certainly the advent of this new type of competitor, the Chinese fast follower, who had access to the Chinese marketplace, which iRobot effectively did not,\" he said on the tech podcast \"Hard Fork\" on Friday.\n\niRobot was founded in 1990 by Angle, Helen Greiner, and Rodney Brooks — roboticists at MIT — who had a \"vision of making practical robots a reality,\" the company says on its website. It released its popular robot vacuum, Roomba, in 2002, which effectively created the category of consumer robotics.\n\nFor the next two decades, Angle said that the company grew the category and, for a brief period, was the leading manufacturer of vacuuming robots in China. The company reached its peak revenue in 2021, at $1.56 billion.\n\nIn the years that followed, however, Angle said the home robotics market was upended by new entrants from China, such as Roborock, which had been chipping away at iRobot's dominance since its arrival in 2018. Other Chinese competitors include Dreame, Ecovacs, and Shar.\n\nAngle said that companies like Roborock had an advantage against iRobot because they had a \"protected market to cut your teeth on for the competition.\"\n\nChina made several moves to ensure that Chinese manufacturers in the category had an advantage by providing direct subsidies to iRobot's competitors, Angle said.\n\nOver the past few years, China has made significant strides toward becoming a global hub for robotics innovation and adoption, rolling out multiple strategic plans across several sectors. As part of those efforts, the government has subsidized robot purchases at an average rate of about 17.5% of equipment costs, according to the Asian Robotics Review.\n\nIn some cases, iRobot's features simply lagged behind its competitors.\n\n\"Honestly, we got wet mopping wrong,\" he said. Scuba, iRobot's mopping robot, never took off as an independent product.\n\n\"It certainly got hard, and it got increasingly competitive,\" Angle said. \"Ultimately, we were open to other strategies to enable us to continue to innovate.\"\n\nOne of those was striking a deal with Amazon, which attempted to acquire the company for $1.4 billion, but the deal was terminated following an antitrust review by the Federal Trade Commission and European regulators.\n\n\"The Commission's probe focused on Amazon's ability and incentive to favor its own products and disfavor rivals, and associated effects on innovation, entry barriers, and consumer privacy,\" the FTC said in a statement in 2024. \"The Commission's investigation revealed significant concerns about the transaction's potential competitive effects.\"\n\nAngle said the deal should have been a \"no-brainer\" in a recent interview with TechCrunch.\n\n\"What happened was that iRobot and Amazon came together for the expressed purpose of creating more innovation, more consumer choice, at a time when iRobot's trajectory was honestly different from where it was several years earlier,\" he told TechCrunch.\n\nHe said the FTC and the European Commission's investigation should not have gone longer than three or four weeks.\n\n\"What happened instead was a year and a half of pendency, which had a very challenging impact on the ability to operate a company and ultimately having the acquisition blocked,\" he said.\n\nHe said iRobot should serve as a cautionary tale for the future of US manufacturing.\n\n\"The net result, which, I have argued, was done with eyes wide open, was putting the consumer robot industry in a box, gift-wrapping it, and handing it to someone else,\" he told \"Hard Fork.\"",

    "description": "Lee Wan Yu, a former Disneyland parade dancer, shares a behind-the-scenes look at the audition process and what she learned from Disney's magic.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Lee Wan Yu, 30, a Hong Kong Disneyland parade dancer turned freelance dance artist, teacher, and choreographer. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI started dancing when I was three years old, after asking my mom for ballet lessons as we walked past a studio.\n\nFrom then on, all I wanted to do was dance. That love eventually led me somewhere I, as an introvert, never expected: Hong Kong Disneyland.\n\nIt started in 2017, when Hong Kong Disneyland held an audition at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts in Singapore, where I was studying for my diploma in dance.\n\nI went with a friend who didn't want to go alone. I had no expectations and just wanted to see how a professional audition works.\n\nAbout 50 dancers from the region participated in the audition.\n\nThey gave us a short jazz combination and had us perform it in small groups, cutting dancers until about 20 of us were left. They took our photos, measured our height, and recorded our body measurements.\n\nMonths later, while I was studying for my fine arts degree in New York, I was offered a standard one-year contract as a parade dancer at Hong Kong Disneyland.\n\nWhen I arrived in May 2018, I realized I was the only Singaporean parade dancer at the time. The team included dancers from Hong Kong, Japan, the Philippines, Russia, Taiwan, and Thailand.\n\nA typical day started around 11 a.m. We had a warm-up class, followed by makeup and costumes.\n\nWe typically performed two parades a day, one in the afternoon and one at night, for about 30 minutes each. During festive seasons like Christmas, we could have up to four parades a day.\n\nIn the middle of each parade, we would stop in front of the castle for a short \"show stop\" to interact with guests.\n\nRehearsals for the Halloween parades sometimes ended around 2 a.m. because they took place after the park closed for the night.\n\nThe Hong Kong heat can be terrible, and the night-parade costumes had lights wired through and batteries attached. You could feel the weight pressing on your shoulders.\n\nSometimes I felt homesick or lonely, but once you're in costume, you have to bring your full energy.\n\nWhen you step into Disneyland, you should feel like you're transported to a different world — a place where you can disconnect, forget your problems for a while, and just be happy.\n\nThis is why guests would never see dancers working out during breaks, because Disney wanted to keep the illusion. We were also not allowed to take any backstage photos or videos.\n\nThe magic is the reason some guests come to every parade. There were adults who followed the route, taking photos, and kids who waved at us every day. I remember a teenage boy who came almost every weekend, dancing beside the route the whole time.\n\nSome of them recognized us outside the park without our costumes. Others gave us prints of photos they had taken of us.\n\nIt was more than just branding and the experience.\n\nAt Hong Kong Disneyland, everyone, from the dancers to the sound crew, respected one another. Even when people were tired, they were still polite. That attitude really stuck with me.\n\nI learned that how I treat people — not just the audience, but also my colleagues, the costume team, and the stage managers — really affects how smoothly everything runs and whether people want to be around you.\n\nOn the other side, Disney valued its performers. It was very serious about safety and well-being. We had good medical insurance, which is important for dancers.\n\nAfter one year, I decided not to re-audition for contract renewal. I wanted to explore new challenges.\n\nI'm now a freelance dancer, teacher, and choreographer in Singapore, where I try to infuse Disney's spirit of \"magic\" into my work.\n\nDance training can be stressful for kids, especially during exams or competitions, so I try to keep that sense of fun alive and create an environment where my students feel safe and excited to learn.\n\nThe magic is about creating that little moment in class where someone feels proud or inspired.\n\nI also try to bring that same magic into my choreography. AI plays a small part in helping me express my ideas.\n\nAs a choreographer, I often have to write synopses for school performances or competitions, and that part is difficult because dancers think in movement, not in sentences.\n\nRecently, I started using ChatGPT to help organize my ideas. I don't let it write for me, but I use it to structure what I already have and express my thoughts more clearly.\n\nI'm also open to trying AI software for large-scale productions with apps that can help with pinpoint formations, map things out, and visualise spacing.\n\nOver the past two years, I was a choreographer for Singapore's National Day Parade performances, overseeing close to 600 students for one of them. I remember spending weeks figuring out formations by hand, staying up until 3 a.m. or 4 a.m., moving people around in Excel.\n\nIf AI could help with that, it would save so much time.\n\nBut technology can only assist — the emotion behind the movement still has to come from people.",

One video on X showed at least five Waymos crowding an intersection, forcing human drivers to maneuver around them.\n\nThe power outage in San Francisco has caused Waymo’s self-driving cars to come to a halt, leading to traffic disruptions across the city. https://t.co/8vPCrKF9ze pic.twitter.com/kXjOJ3UN4c\n\nWaymo suspended its ride-hailing services on Saturday in response to the power outage, which affected about 130,000 Pacific Gas & Electric customers.\n\nOn Sunday, a spokesperson for Waymo told Business Insider that the company had resumed its service in the area.\n\n\"Yesterday's power outage was a widespread event that caused gridlock across San Francisco, with non-functioning traffic signals and transit disruptions,\" the spokesperson said. \"While the failure of the utility infrastructure was significant, we are committed to ensuring our technology adjusts to traffic flow during such events.\"\n\nOn X, Tesla CEO Elon Musk used the incident to promote his company's own robotaxis. \"Tesla Robotaxis were unaffected by the SF power outage,\" he wrote.\n\nTesla and Waymo are direct competitors in the autonomous ride-hailing market, but are relying on different technologies to get them there.\n\nTesla robotaxis use cameras and AI to find their way around. Waymo uses a suite of light sensors, radar, cameras, and detailed maps that are uploaded and regularly updated. That means sudden changes to the areas where a Waymo robotaxi operates could impact its ability to navigate.\n\nWaymo, owned by Alphabet Inc., debuted its autonomous ride-hailing service to the public in 2018 in the Phoenix metro area.\n\nThe company has expanded its services to other cities, including Austin and Atlanta, through a partnership with Uber, but it hasn't all been smooth sailing.\n\nIn May, Waymo recalled the software for more than 1,200 cars after some collided with \"chains or gates.\" More recently, a Waymo vehicle hit and killed a beloved bodega cat in San Francisco, sparking outrage from residents.",

In an earlier statement, the military did not use the word “suspected,” and said the person “hurled a block toward the soldiers.”\n\nThe Palestinian was identified as 16-year-old Rayan Muhammad Abdul Qader Abu Mualla by the Ministry of Health, citing the Palestinian General Authority of Civil Affairs (PGACA), who said his body is still being held by Israel after he was killed in the Al-Sab’aneh neighborhood in Qabatiya.\n\nA 26-second security camera video shared on social media and geolocated by CNN to Al-Sab’aneh, shows what appears to be the moment Israeli troops shot Abu Mualla.\n\nIn the video, a person walks down an alley towards two helmeted soldiers crouched partially behind a corner. The person is just about to reach the corner when one soldier raises his rifle and fires at point blank range, causing the person to collapse backwards.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in its initial statement that its soldiers had been attacked by a “terrorist.” The video shows the 18 seconds before the shooting, in which time nothing appears to be thrown from the alley the Palestinian teenager comes from. His left hand, however, is obscured. It was not immediately clear who captured the footage, who initially released it, or what happened before the video begins.\n\nOn Saturday, the Israeli news site Ynet published what it says is a photo of Abu Mualla’s left hand clutching a chunk of concrete, taken after his death. CNN could not verify whether the photo is of the same person in the security footage.\n\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent said that Israeli troops blocked its emergency workers from reaching the scene of the shooting.\n\nA set of videos geolocated by CNN show an ambulance, with its emergency lights on, stopped about 650 feet away from the site of the shooting.\n\nAsked for comment on the video and the allegation that emergency workers were blocked from reaching Abu Mualla, the IDF said: “Yesterday (Saturday), a Palestinian suspected of hurling a block at IDF soldiers was shot. The incident is under review.”\n\nLate on Saturday, Abu Mualla’s school announced on Facebook that it would close on Sunday in honor of his memory and pushed exams a week ahead.\n\nIn a separate incident on Saturday, the Ministry of Health said the IDF shot and killed a 22-year-old Palestinian man named Ahmed Saed Ziyoud in Silat al-Harathiya, a town north of Jenin in the West Bank.\n\nThe IDF said in a statement on Telegram that it shot an individual in Silat al-Harathiya who “hurled an explosive” toward soldiers.\n\nOn Sunday, the military wing of the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine, said he was a fighter in the Al-Quds Brigades. He was shot by an Israeli sniper’s bullet during the IDF storming of the town.\n\nCNN’s Dana Karni contributed to this report.",

    "description": "Excavations revealed everything from a 14th-century Black Death group burial to three skeletons from the late 12th or early 13th centuries buried in coffins.",
    "fullText": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nHere’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nThe first excavation at the famed Tower of London in a generation uncovered more than 20 skeletal remains.\n\nExcavations revealed everything from a 14th-century Black Death group burial to three skeletons from the late 12th or early 13th centuries buried in coffins.\n\nThe on-site chapel is serving as a tell-all of London’s medieval history.\n\nA rare dig into the soil of the famed Tower of London—the first excavation at the site in a generation—yielded two skeletons from around 1500. As archaeologists dug deeper into the ground, they found roughly 20 more burials, including one group grave likely tied to the 1348 “Black Death” plague.\n\n“Undertaking these two excavations has provided us with a generational opportunity to enhance our understanding of the evolution off the Chapel of Saint Peter ad Vincula, and the buildings which stood before it,” Alfred Hawkins, curator of historic buildings at Historic Royal Palaces, the organization that oversees the Tower, said in a statement.\n\nThe dig began as a trial excavation in 2019 to prepare the on-site Chapel Royal of St Peter ad Vincula for a new elevator. The archaeologists helming the excavation discovered the remains of two skeletons. Subsequent excavations outside the chapel as deep as 10 feet below the surface revealed everything from a 14th-century Black Death group burial to three skeletons from the late 12th or early 13th centuries buried in coffins—an unusually expensive burial for that time.\n\nJane Sidell, principal inspector of ancient monuments at Historic England, said the team is already gaining insight into the residents of the Tower in a way they never have before. “This is just the tip of the iceberg,” she said in a statement. “There is so much more to learn through further analysis about the people as well as the buildings of one of England’s most evocative historic monuments.”\n\nThe Tower of London was built alongside the River Thames in the 1070s as a royal palace. It also served as a prison for high-status individuals (including King Henry VI), and housed the country’s Royal Mint. But it has seemingly almost always had a chapel on its grounds.\n\nThe current parish church for the residents of the Tower of London was built in 1520, after a 1512 fire devoured the one King Edward I built in 1287. A compacted layer of stone found in the recent excavation could be a 1240 project at the site led by Henry III, showing there was a chapel before 1287.\n\nAnd since the current chapel sits atop the same land as the Tower’s previous chapel foundations, burials aplenty are to be expected. Of the recent finds, the older burials could have even been buried inside one of the long-destroyed chapels. “Typically, if you’re buried closer to the church, you’re more important, and if you’re buried inside the church, you’re much, much more important, and if you’re buried under the altar, you are the most important person,” Hawkins said, according to National Geographic.\n\nKnown burials at the site include three queens and two Catholic saints, but finding out more about the unknown skeletons could help piece together the medieval story of the site.\n\n“The new excavations provide the opportunity to transform our understanding of the Tower’s community,” Katie Faillace from Cardiff University’s School of History, Archaeology, and Religion, said in a statement. “Our work uses a biomolecular technique known as isotope analysis, which tells us about health, diet, and mobility in the past, all from a tiny fragment of a tooth. This cutting-edge method was unparalleled potential for reconstructing the experiences of the people who lived and died at the Tower, allowing us to build a rich picture of individuals’ lives.”\n\nThe analysis on the first two skeletons starts developing that picture. Richard Madgwick, archaeological scientist at Cardiff University and part of the team, told National Geographic that one individual was likely a middle-aged female who died between 1480 and 1550. Clues indicate she likely lived as far away as Wales at one point, and had a diet featuring sugar—an expensive ingredient at the time.\n\nThe second skeleton belonged to a younger man who died around the same time. Details of his remains show a high-stress life that likely played out just north of London. His diet was much less exotic.\n\n“I’m looking forward to starting analysis of some of the other amazing finds we have uncovered along the way,” Hawkins said. “This is a very, very rare opportunity to get this information.”\n\nAlong with the remains, the team found a rare burial shroud from the late 12th or early 13th century (fabric doesn’t usually last through the ages), jewelry, shards of stained glass, and rare grave goods in the form of funerary incense pots dated to between 1150 and 1250 (with charcoal still inside them).\n\n“At the moment we’ve got these lovely two biographies,” Madgwick said. “It hints at the dynamic movement of people and the dynamic life trajectories of the people who were buried in the Tower, but it’s going to be really exciting to see whether we’ve picked two anomalies, or whether we see the broader range of lifeways that we see of those buried here.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "A Reddit post has sparked outrage after one worker shared how their company owner flaunts luxury while denying fair compensation to workers. The boss reportedly bought himself a Ferrari and gave his 17-year-old daughter a brand-new Lamborghini Urus. Meanwhile, employees were denied a cost-of-living adjustment and forced into a cheaper health insurance plan.\n\nThe employee wrote, “This man and his attorneys have the gall to deny us a cost of living increase and just switched our health insurance to United Healthcare to save a few dollars.”\n\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nDeloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\n\nOne moment that particularly stung involved a coworker who died in a car accident. The company owner sent the widow a card with $50 in cash and a $50  gift card. The employees, by contrast, pooled $1,800 of their own money to support the grieving family.\n\n“The employees contributed to the funeral and final expenses,” the poster added. “And he sent her $50 and a gift card.”\n\nThis touched off many responses from other workers with similar stories. One commenter wrote, “This happened at my husband’s old job. Everyone in the family got brand new cars, and they took away paid holidays and [paid time off]… they lost three people within a month.”\n\nAnother said they discovered their boss was sending offers on used Rolls-Royces on eBay, while refusing to increase pay.\n\nTrending: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace—Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\n\nThe post resonated because it reflects a broader frustration among American workers. Many commenters noted that lavish executive lifestyles often come directly at the expense of employees.\n\n“He isn't buying luxury cars despite not paying you and switching you to cheaper insurance,” one person wrote. “He is buying luxury cars because he's not paying you… That is your money.”\n\nAnother commenter summed it up like this: “Record profits are stolen wages.”\n\nPeople shared stories of bosses who slashed hours, removed retirement contributions, and still found ways to upgrade their luxury lifestyles. Several said they were pushed to donate paid time off to terminally ill coworkers while the owners hoarded profits.\n\nOne person recalled, “Two weeks later [after saying he couldn’t afford raises], he bought a fully loaded Rivian R1T in cash.”\n\nSee Also: Missed Tesla? EnergyX Is Tackling the Next $200 Billion Opportunity — Lithium\n\nMany called for unionizing or mass resignations. “Organize a mass quitting. With nobody giving notice,” one person suggested. Another added, “Striking is reasonable, but starting a competing firm with highly motivated team members is even better.”\n\nStill, some felt hopeless, arguing that these issues are systemic. One commenter wrote, “This is 2025 USA in a nutshell.”\n\nWhether or not anything changes for the workers in the original post, the message from the thread is that when employees are asked to sacrifice while their bosses flaunt obscene wealth, it's not just bad optics; it feels like a slap in the face.\n\nRead Next: Wall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors — Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

    "description": "Watters, 47, recounted the alleged conversation to a large crowd at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest in Phoenix on Dec. 20",
    "fullText": "Fox News host Jesse Watters claimed that President Donald Trump told him he is building the new White House ballroom as a “monument” to himself\n\nHe added that Trump said he was doing so because “no one else will”\n\nWatters recounted the alleged conversation while speaking at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest in Phoenix on Dec. 20\n\nJesse Watters claims President Donald Trump told him he is constructing the new White House ballroom as a “monument” to himself — and that he’s doing it “because no one else will.”\n\nThe Fox News host recounted the alleged conversation while speaking at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest, a multiday conservative conference and festival in Phoenix, on Saturday, Dec. 20. A video of the moment has since been posted on X.\n\nWatters, 47, told the large crowd that he was sharing a meal with Trump, 79, when the president asked him if he wanted to see a rendition of “the big, beautiful ballroom.”\n\n“I said, ‘Sure, let me see it,’ “ Watters continued. “He [Trump] rolls the whole thing out. And guys, I don't know if you know this — the ballroom is huge. Like, I said, ‘Mr. President, the ballroom is four times the size of the White House.' ”\n\n“He said, ‘Jesse, it's a monument. I'm building a monument to myself — because no one else will,' \" Watters added, eliciting loud laughs from the audience.\n\nThe PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now!\n\nTrump recently said that the 90,000-square-foot ballroom, which is being built on the site of the former East Wing, will now cost $400 million — a significant jump from earlier estimates.\n\nTrump announced the updated price tag on Dec. 17 during a Hanukkah reception at the White House, where he also revealed that a federal judge has allowed construction on the controversial project to move forward. He repeated the figure multiple times while thanking the official for clearing the way for continued construction, describing the ruling as an act of “courage.”\n\nThe ballroom — which is being funded entirely by private donors, including a contribution from Trump himself — is expected to be completed by summer 2028.\n\nTrump has argued that the sprawling ballroom is needed so future presidents can host large events indoors rather than on the South Lawn.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nIt's unclear just how many people the space can accommodate. Trump told NBC News in September that it would hold up to 900 people; BBC reporting cites plans for a capacity of 1,350.\n\nOn Dec. 16, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon rejected a request from the National Trust for Historic Preservation to temporarily halt construction while the project undergoes additional review, the Associated Press reported.\n\nHowever, the judge said he plans to hold a hearing in January on the group’s request for a preliminary injunction and warned the administration not to make underground construction decisions that would lock in the design of the ballroom above ground, per Bloomberg.",

    "description": "Chief cricket reporter Stephan Shemilt marks the performances of the Australia and England teams after the third Test in Adelaide.",
    "fullText": "Australia have beaten England by 82 runs in the third Test to go 3-0 up and secure the Ashes at the earliest opportunity.\n\nHere are our player ratings for the Adelaide contest:\n\nBen Duckett – 2 – Arrived with a reputation as one of the best openers in the world, only to suffer a collapse in form and presence. Failures of others were predictable, Duckett's was not and is a huge concern.\n\nZak Crawley – 6 – Showed admirable fight and adaptability in England's second innings, but probably needs a hundred to be immune from a post-series clearout.\n\nOllie Pope – 2 – Test career over for now? Averages 17.6 in Ashes Tests. Since 1900, only England's Dennis Amiss has had as many as Pope's 16 innings in the top six in Ashes Tests and averaged less.\n\nJoe Root – 4 – Two starts, without making a telling contribution. Twice dismissed by Cummins, for whom Root is a bunny. The Yorkshireman must be pleased the Australia captain missed the first two Tests of the series.\n\nHarry Brook – 5 – Largely stayed true to his promise to \"rein it in\", but the second-innings dismissal reverse-sweeping Lyon was ugly. Would be a huge waste if Australia does not see his best on this tour.\n\nBen Stokes – 6 – Battled bravely in England's first innings, even if his resistance never seemed likely to turn into a trademark miracle. Did not bowl when England needed him on day three.\n\nJamie Smith – 6 – Finally got into the series with a counter-attacking 60 in the second innings, now has to kick on in Melbourne and Sydney.\n\nWill Jacks – 6 – A part-time spinner unfairly asked to do the job of a veteran. Resisted admirably with the bat, making himself harder to leave out.\n\nBrydon Carse – 5 – Continuing a bizarre tour of picking up wickets despite not bowling well. England have a decision to make over the Durham man in Melbourne.\n\nJofra Archer – 8 – Emerging as England's player of the tour. A maiden Test half-century and first five-wicket haul in six years. Demonstrating it was more than worth the wait for him to return to full fitness.\n\nJosh Tongue – 6 – Encouraging return after being overlooked for the first two Tests. Was the unfortunate bowler for the Khawaja drop and Carey Snicko shocker. Should get another go in Melbourne.\n\nJake Weatherald - 2 - Quiet game after a promising start to his Test career. Would be a potential Australian weakness for England to exploit had the Ashes not already been lost.\n\nTravis Head – 8 – Any flicker of hope England might have had was snuffed out by a century from South Australia's favourite son in the second innings. Head's promotion to open the batting is a defining moment in the outcome of the series.\n\nMarnus Labuschagne – 5 – No real contribution with the bat, but gets an extra mark apiece for two sensational catches at second slip. Still a nagging doubt he has a big score in him before the end of the series.\n\nUsman Khawaja – 7 – Took his chance after Steve Smith's illness, albeit via a life from Harry Brook. Should keep his place for Sydney.\n\nCameron Green – 4 – Could not produce a performance to match his huge Indian Premier League pricetag and batting two places too high. Took the important wicket of Brook in the first innings.\n\nAlex Carey – 8 – Challenging Mitchell Starc as player of the series. Loses a point because he should have been given out in the first innings.\n\nJosh Inglis – 4 – An important 32 when England sensed momentum on the first day, but hasn't fully taken his chance. Could be squeezed out when Smith returns.\n\nPat Cummins – 7 – How has this man not bowled since July? Immediately into the groove with relentless accuracy. Once again an Ashes-winning captain.\n\nMitchell Starc – 6 – Not touching the heights of the first two Tests, though bowled with high pace in the first innings and took the key wickets of Jamie Smith and Will Jacks on the final day.\n\nNathan Lyon – 6 – Broke England's resistance with a triple-wicket burst on the fourth evening, only to hobble off with a hamstring injury on the final day. Could be out for the series.\n\nScott Boland – 6 – Unsung hero of Australia's attack, keeping up the pressure when the superstars rest. Will be in the conversation to rest in Melbourne, the venue where he destroyed England four years ago.\n\n'Bazball as we knew it is in the skip - but McCullum has England future'\n\nBooze, beach, beaten – how England lost the Ashes\n\nThe 10 moments that decided the Ashes\n\nStokes wants to remain captain despite Ashes defeat",

Like a throwback to the good old days under Brendan Rodgers, Ange Postecoglou or even Martin O'Neill.\n\nWith 31 shots on goal, 10 on target and an xG (expected goals) of 4.5, Celtic should have been out of sight. The only thing for supporters to worry about should have been some last-minute Christmas shopping.\n\nBut when Kenan Bilalovic thudded his shot under Kasper Schmeichel to draw 10-man Aberdeen inexplicably level with 16 minutes to remaining, concerns were firmly focused on Nancy again.\n\nSince taking change from O'Neill less than three weeks ago, many fans will have wondered if he realised what he'd walked into.\n\nAnd while Nancy would be forgiven for failing to make sense of Sunday's ridiculous contest, he'll not be given so much leeway if the rays of light on show against Aberdeen don't turn into a full new dawn.",

    "fullText": "Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse pushed back hard against a fresh XRP manipulation claim after the token slid to $1.77 before rebounding toward $1.88 during a choppy December. The move capped a 5% weekly drop. Even though XRP still trades in a higher range since Ripple’s courtroom win over the SEC.\n\nThe comments arrive in a market where new XRP futures, ETFs, and a Ripple-backed stablecoin are all reshaping how money flows around the beloved community asset.\n\nGarlinghouse told CNN that “nobody is in a position to manipulate XRP prices.” he noted that XRP trades with multi‑billion‑dollar daily volume and tracks the crypto market rather than Ripple’s internal decisions. He said XRP is now too big and too liquid for one actor, Ripple’s backend included, to move it like a tiny micro‑cap coin.\n\nThink of liquidity like the size of the swimming pool. A small bucket of water can change the level in a kiddie pool, but not in an Olympic one. Garlinghouse said low‑liquidity tokens are vulnerable to pump‑and‑dump games, but XRP’s scale makes that far harder.\n\nAccording to CoinDesk, XRP futures volume alone recently ran toward $4 billion during a sharp move, which is not the profile of a thin, easily pushed market. Although it’s dropping now, so does the crypto market.\n\n(source – Ripple Future Volume Today, CoinGecko)\n\nHe also emphasized that banks using Ripple’s payment technology purchase XRP on the open market, not through undisclosed sweetheart deals. These large buyers often agree to lockup terms so they cannot instantly flip all their tokens back into cash, which helps smooth out sudden dumps. For a beginner, this means institutional players usually face guardrails that you, as a small trader, do not see but still benefit from.\n\nDISCOVER: 16+ New and Upcoming Binance Listings in 2025\n\nOne long‑running fear in the XRP community: Ripple owns a huge stash and might “dump” it on the market. Ripple now keeps around 34.4 billion XRP in escrow and 5.1 billion in spendable wallets, releasing 1 billion each month, then relocking most of it. That schedule informs you in advance how much XRP might enter the market, which is important because sudden selling is what usually scares prices the most.\n\nGarlinghouse said Ripple usually keeps only about 200 million XRP per month for operations and returns the rest to escrow. He admitted in an older Financial Times quote that Ripple would not be cash-flow positive without XRP sales, but he argued that those sales now follow a predictable and transparent pattern. As a beginner, you do not need to love that model, but you at least know the faucet is on a timer, not a random fire hose.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is recalling nearly 30 career diplomats from ambassadorial and other senior embassy posts as it moves to reshape the U.S. diplomatic posture abroad with personnel deemed fully supportive of President Donald Trump’s “America First” priorities.\n\nThe chiefs of mission in at least 29 countries were informed last week that their tenures would end in January, according to two State Department officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal personnel moves.\n\nAll of them had taken up their posts in the Biden administration but had survived an initial purge in the early months of Trump’s second term that targeted mainly political appointees. That changed on Wednesday when they began to receive notices from officials in Washington about their imminent departures.\n\nAmbassadors serve at the pleasure of the president although they typically remain at their posts for three to four years. Those affected by the shake-up are not losing their foreign service jobs but will be returning to Washington for other assignments should they wish to take them, the officials said.\n\nThe State Department declined to comment on specific numbers or ambassadors affected, but defended the changes, calling them “a standard process in any administration.” It noted that an ambassador is “a personal representative of the president and it is the president’s right to ensure that he has individuals in these countries who advance the America First agenda.”\n\nAfrica is the continent most affected by the removals, with ambassadors from 13 countries being removed: Burundi, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Madagascar, Mauritius, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Somalia and Uganda.\n\nSecond is Asia, with ambassadorial changes coming to six countries: Fiji, Laos, the Marshall Islands, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines and Vietnam affected.\n\nFour countries in Europe (Armenia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Slovakia) are affected; as are two each in the Middle East (Algeria and Egypt); South and Central Asia (Nepal and Sri Lanka); and the Western Hemisphere (Guatemala and Suriname).\n\nPolitico was the first to report on the ambassadorial recalls, which have drawn concern from some lawmakers and the union representing American diplomats.",

    "fullText": "The Kennedy Center is already losing performers after Donald Trump slapped his name on the storied arts institution.\n\nKristy Lee, a folk singer scheduled to perform at the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts on Jan. 14, is in talks to cancel her appearance, her spokesperson told NOTUS, as other artists also move to sever ties with the venue.\n\nOne performer, who spoke to NOTUS on the condition of anonymity, said Trump’s renaming had left a permanent “stain” on the center.\n\nAnother lamented what the Kennedy Center once represented—for artists and for the country at large. “I feel really badly for performers, not just for performers but for the people who work there,” they said.\n\n“Kennedy Center is supposed to be a memorial, focusing on being nonpartisan. A place where people, it doesn’t matter what party they believe in, should be performing and experiencing the arts together regardless of what their party is. And it has not become that.”\n\nOther artists who reluctantly chose to keep their scheduled performances at the center told NOTUS they are doing so as an act of resistance to the 79-year-old president.\n\n“Reality show personality and con artist aren’t the type of artist the center showcases,” one artist said. They added that they “don’t associate the arts, or this building, with Trump.”\n\n“And I guess the real debate up till now is what you boycott it and help ensure it goes down the tubes,” the musician added. “Or do you do the concerts and keep the audiences that love going to the Kennedy Center. And make sure there’s something there after this guy leaves. And it could be restored from however he trashes it.”\n\nThe backlash follows an announcement Thursday from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt that the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts would be tackily renamed to include Trump’s name after a vote by the venue’s board, which is now stacked with MAGA loyalists.\n\n“Congratulations to President Donald J. Trump, and likewise, congratulations to President Kennedy, because this will be a truly great team long into the future!” she wrote on X. “The building will no doubt attain new levels of success and grandeur.”\n\nThe board includes White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles; Attorney General Pam Bondi; second lady Usha Vance; Deputy White House Chief of Staff Dan Scavino; and Allison Lutnick, the wife of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.\n\nA source told CNN that Trump phoned into Thursday’s meeting ahead of the vote.\n\nA day later, the president’s name was quickly and tackily plastered onto the center’s building, which now reads: “The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.”\n\nDemocrats and historians, however, have insisted that renaming the venue requires an act of Congress.\n\n“The Kennedy Center was named by law. To change the name would require a revision of that 1964 law,” Ray Smock, a former House historian, wrote in an email to the Associated Press. “The Kennedy Center board is not a lawmaking entity. Congress makes laws.”\n\nMeanwhile, many of Kennedy’s relatives have expressed their outrage.\n\n“Three years and one month from today, I’m going to grab a pickax and pull those letters off that building, but I’m going to need help holding the ladder,” Kerry Kennedy, 66, wrote on X Friday.\n\nThe lawyer and former president’s niece added: “Are you in? Applying for my carpenter’s card today, so it’ll be a union job!!!”\n\nTrump set his sights on the center months ago and has repeatedly suggested it be renamed the Trump-Kennedy Center in public remarks and on social media. At the same time, ticket sales have reportedly plummeted and audiences thinned since Trump’s takeover.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",
