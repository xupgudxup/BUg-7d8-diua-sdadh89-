    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks picked up their most exciting victory of the 2025 season in Week 16 on Thursday Night Football. The Seahawks overcame a multi-score fourth quarter deficit to defeat the Los Angeles Rams 38-37 in overtime. A two-point conversion in overtime sealed the win and helped Mike Macdonald's team take over first place in the NFC West division (and conference).\n\nThe Seahawks did it without much assistance from their pass rush. In fact, Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford wasn't sacked on a single occasion. It's impressive that the Seahawks offense managed to pick up a defense that allowed a MVP candidate in Stafford to operate from a comfortable pocket.\n\nThe Seahawks didn't have success rushing Stafford at all this year. In their Week 11 defeat, they also failed to sack the former Detroit Lions quarterback. Registering zero sacks on Stafford in nine quarters of play strongly indicates that the Rams' offensive line protected their star QB.\n\nHowever, it's worth acknowledging the Seahawks defense got multiple crucial stops throughout the fourth quarter. DeMarcus Lawrence and Uchenna Nwosu notched some pressures on Stafford during the Seahawks' comeback that led to incomplete passes and eventual punts. Seattle overcame their zero-burger in the sack column to get a much-needed win.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Seahawks Wire: Seahawks overcame lack of pass rush in Week 16 win over Rams",

    "fullText": "This week, Chiefs Wire's Ed Easton Jr. spoke with retired All-Pro offensive lineman and CBS Sports analyst Kyle Long.\n\nIn his interview with Easton Jr., Long discussed his role as a remote analyst for NFL Christmas Gameday on Netflix on Thursday, December 25th, and his thoughts on the disappointing 2025 Kansas City Chiefs season.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys vs. Washington Commanders and Detroit Lions vs. Minnesota Vikings will stream live on Netflix. Long will be on the remote team, alongside host Scott Hanson. CBS Sports will produce the games, while NFL Media will produce the pre-, post-, and studio halftime programming.\n\nNFL CHRISTMAS GAMEDAY\nLIVE on Netflix December 25\n-- \nCowboys vs. Commanders @ 1 PM ET\nLions vs. Vikings @ 4:30 PM ET\n\n— Netflix Sports (@netflixsports) December 19, 2025\n\n\"Well, first and foremost, I saw a group that was lacking the aforementioned Joe Thuney, and Trey Smith, the other Pro Bowl-level guy at right guard, was in and out of the lineup. I look at the defense, which is really the unsung hero in this dynasty,\" said Long, \"That is the Kansas City Chiefs' historically strong ability to get teams off the field on third down. You know, you know, when the defenders hold up their fists, and they're like, We did it. We did it. We didn't see a lot of fists in the air this year for the Kansas City Chiefs.\"\n\nLong played his final NFL season in 2021 with the Chiefs, alongside many teammates who remain with the franchise today. Kansas City struggled in close games throughout the season, tallying few takeaways and sacks.\n\n\"Not only that, their sack numbers were down, and their ability to get after opposing quarterbacks has been a trademark. The fan club for Chris Jones is called 'Sack Nation'. Well, they've been out to lunch all year, and it's not just Chris Jones,\" said Long, \"He's getting triple-teamed, double-teamed. That guy's an incredible player. They don't have enough juice on defense to stay in games the way they did last year. When somebody went out offensively, the defense would make a big play. They cover each other. That's complimentary football. We didn't see it from the Chiefs this year.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Kyle Long comments on the Kansas City Chiefs' disappointing season",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens have multiple major issues going into their Week 17 game against the Green Bay Packers.\n\nThe first issue is that the Ravens are one loss away or one Pittsburgh Steelers win away from being eliminated from AFC North contention, which is their only avenue to make the postseason at this point.\n\nThe next issue is that quarterback Lamar Jackson is dealing with a back injury that forced his early exit from the contest and leaves his status up in the air for the Saturday game against Green Bay.\n\nHere's what we know about Jackson's injury and his chances of suiting up in Week 17.\n\nAccording to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, Jackson is dealing with a bruise in his back and is considered day to day.\n\n\"Ravens QB Lamar Jackson is day-to-day with a back bruise, one that ended his night early against the Patriots,\" Rapoport reported.\n\nWhile it's still too early to know, the fact that Jackson is only considered day to day gives him better chance to play than not.\n\nOne thing that stinks for Jackson is the fact that the Ravens have a short week because of the Week 17 game being on Saturday following a Sunday game.\n\nWhen asked about his status for the crucial game against the Packers, Jackson said the plan is to play, but he did not confirm for sure that he would, nor did Ravens head coach John Harbaugh.\n\n\"Yeah, that's the goal,\" Jackson said, per ESPN's Jamison Hensley. \"We're going to do a little [MRI] scan [Monday] and then see what it shows.\"\n\n\"I don't know how serious it'll be,\" Harbaugh said of Jackson's injury. \"We'll have to find out over the next couple of days.\"\n\nJackson also expressed frustration with the fact that he got kneed in the back while giving up on a play.\n\n\"I gave myself up, and I got kneed in the back,\" Jackson said. \"I can't finish the game with my guys. It's BS.\"\n\nThe next update on Jackson will likely come on Tuesday, when Baltimore releases its first injury report of the week.\n\nHowever, Jackson has routinely sat out on the first day of practice this season, so expect him to be a non-participant no matter what.\n\nEx-NFL official disagrees with one aspect of wild Lions-Steelers finish\n\nDid Ravens bench Derrick Henry?

    "description": "Here are five quick takeaways from the Broncos' loss to the Jaguars.",
    "fullText": "The Denver Broncos (12-3) were upset by the Jacksonville Jaguars (11-4) in a 34-20 loss at home on Sunday afternoon. Here are five quick takeaways from the game.\n\n1. Denver’s defense is in a slump: Over the last two weeks, Vance Joseph's unit has allowed 708 yards of offense and 60 points to their opponents. Jacksonville went 4-of-5 in the red zone on Sunday amd Trevor Lawrence completed 63.9% of his passes for 279 yards with three touchdowns (and he added 20 yards and a score on the ground). This Jaguars offense is talented, but it's a troubling sign for the Broncos that the defense is playing like this just ahead of the playoffs.\n\n2. RJ Harvey is getting hot: The rookie running back rushed seven times for 50 yards and a touchdown, averaging 7.1 yards per carry. He also hauled in four receptions for 71 yards, giving him 121 yards on 11 touches on the day. Harvey has helped make up for the loss of J.K. Dobbins, and Denver can keep him fresh by mixing in Jaleel McLaughlin.\n\n3. Officiating was bad once again: From Malcolm Roach's roughing the passer penalty to Jahdae Barron's pass interference foul, Broncos fans had plenty of reasons to question the officials on Sunday (both plays were fouls by the letter of the law). Denver finished the day with six costly penalties for 61 yards surrendered, and it wasn't the first time this season that they were on the receiving end of some questionable decisions. To be clear, though, the Jaguars played a better game on Sunday, and it would be silly to argue that the officiating cost the Broncos a win.\n\n4. Broncos can still clinch division and No. 1 seed: Despite the loss, Denver still controls its playoff fate. If the Broncos win on Thursday and the Los Angeles Chargers lose to the Houston Texans on Saturday, Denver would clinch the AFC West before hosting L.A. in their regular-season finale in Week 18. And if the Broncos win on Thursday and a few AFC contenders lose, Denver would clinch the No. 1 seed in the conference. Regardless of what happens elsewhere in the conference, the Broncos can clinch the top seed if they win out.\n\n5. Pat Bryant’s health is the biggest focus: Denver's loss on Sunday was overshadowed by Pat Bryant's injury on the second-to-last play of the game. Bryant was taken to a local hospital with concussion-like symptoms, and coach Sean Payton said the receiver had movement in his hands and legs. Bryant's status is much more important than the Broncos' playoff standing, and fans will be hoping and praying he's able to recover quickly. He is believed to be OK.\n\nAfter falling to the Jaguars, the Broncos will now go on the road to face the Kansas City Chiefs in a special Christmas Day edition of Thursday Night Football in Week 17.\n\nSocial: Follow Broncos Wire on Facebook and Twitter/X! Did you know: These 25 celebrities are Broncos fans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Broncos Wire: Denver Broncos: 5 takeaways from 34-20 loss to Jacksonville Jaguars",

Discussing what’s next for Rice, Rooney believes he is the outstanding candidate to become England captain, when Harry Kane departs international football.\n\n“For me, he’s the one who’s probably waiting for Harry to hang up his boots at some point,” Rooney told BBC Sport’s The Wayne Rooney Show.\n\n“He was all over the pitch [against Everton]. His decision-making – when to pass it, where to pass it, what foot to pass it to, his detail on his pass – it was a pleasure to watch. He was absolutely incredible.\n\n“He was splitting centre-backs, taking the ball off [Arsenal’s] centre-backs, acting as a third centre-back, then next minute he’s in the box, trying to score a goal. Sometimes, some of the stuff he does is a bit underrated.\n\n“He’s the right one to take over [Kane] for me, because [of] his drive, his personality. Everyone seems to love him, who knows him, who’s close to him.

    "fullText": "BALTIMORE — When it comes to the NFL, there are always controversial calls in every game. But there was one in particular that seemed beyond obvious, which the officials didn't call.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, as the Patriots were driving down the field on their comeback attempt, quarterback Drake Maye sent a deep ball to Kayshon Boutte, and all signs pointed to Boutte making the catch.\n\nBut while the ball was still in the air, the receiver was being pulled down by Ravens cornerback Marlon Humphrey. As a result, Boutte was unable to make the catch and was even injured on the play, hitting his head on the ground.\n\nHowever, the officials kept the flags away.\n\nAfter the game, Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel was asked if he got an explanation for the no-call.\n\n“No, here’s what the explanation I got: ‘You have to survive the ground.’ So I’m very aware of the catch rule, but that’s all I got,” Vrabel responded.\n\nWhat in the world was this official looking at during this play? Did he accidentally leave his flag at home? What if Humphrey intercepted it? pic.twitter.com/0TqZ6MrUqQ\n\n— Doug Kyed (@DougKyed) December 22, 2025\n\nLuckily, the Patriots pulled out the win in the end, but this call certainly warrants some explanation from the officials.\n\nFollow Patriots Wire on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Patriots Wire: Did Patriots get explanation for controversial Kayshon Boutte no-call?",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWith Giannis Antetokounmpo being one of the biggest names in the NBA, the idea of the Milwaukee Bucks forward getting traded has put him under a microscope.\n\nEvery move or comment Antetokounmpo makes gets the fans talking. And the superstar’s recent interaction with the Minnesota Timberwolves star Anthony Edwards generated a ton of buzz.\n\nIt wasn’t a long conversation, but it was enough to get the imagination going.\n\nAnthony Edwards and Giannis Antetokounmpo 👀 pic.twitter.com/Bd4rpothba\n\n— Fullcourtpass (@Fullcourtpass) December 22, 2025\n\n@rvpats1212: Cant wait til Giannis joins the Wolves and hoops alongside Anthony Edwards.\n\n@NickBuysCrypto: there was a little too much dap there\n\n@CRan3069: Over the summer, Giannis called Ant is favorite player in the league (along with  his former teammate Dame).\n\n@CaptainLeMerica: This duo would be closest duo style to Bron & D wade im shaking\n\n@DripMuse_: This would be like if dame was in his prime when he teamed up with giannis\n\nThe Timberwolves and the Bucks met for a Sunday matchup, which didn’t include Antetokounmpo.\n\nLately, the two-way superstar has been dealing with a calf strain. He’s expected to miss four to six weeks of action. Although he hasn’t been healthy enough to play, Antetokounmpo’s future in Milwaukee has remained a burning topic around the league.\n\n\"If my agent is talking to the Bucks about it, he's his own person. He can have any conversation he wants,\" Antetokounmpo told reporters last week. \"At the end of the day, I personally have not had the conversation with the Bucks. I'm still locked in, locked in on my teammates, most importantly locked in on me getting back healthy.\"\n\nDespite Antetokounmpo publicly shooting down the idea of wanting to get traded, fans remain unconvinced.\n\n@KobeBryant_jr: Hmmm Giannis to the wolves would be insane\n\n@dukethareaper1: ant and giannis as teammates would go crazy\n\nBefore going down with his latest injury, Antetokounmpo appeared in 17 games this season. He averaged 28.9 points, 10.1 rebounds, and 6.1 assists, and nearly one block per game\n\nIt was recently reported by NBA insider Chris Haynes that the Timberwolves are among a handful of teams that have expressed interest in Giannis.\n\nHowever, there hasn’t been any traction behind reports that suggest the interest is mutual. All signs have been pointing to Giannis having his eyes on the New York Knicks and the Miami Heat if he were to get traded. Contrary to the popular belief outside of Milwaukee, Antetokounmpo seems to be willing to see if the Bucks can improve their situation before he demands a move.",

    "description": "How about that win from a small market team?",
    "fullText": "How about the freaking Jaguars?\n\nJacksonville traveled out to Denver –  a team riding an 11-game win streak and the league’s best red zone defense – and won, 34-20, while converting on four of five trips in the red zone. The win didn’t clinch the playoffs just yet, but it sure as hell put Jacksonville in the driver’s seat with two games to go in the regular season.\n\nThis isn’t the Jags of old. This isn’t the Jags of last year or even a few weeks ago. This is a Jags team that’s as hot as any in the league and hasn’t lost in five straight games. With an 11-4 record, Liam Coen’s bunch is humming at the right time with two easily winnable games left on the schedule at Indianapolis and at home against the Titans.\n\nIt hasn’t felt like this in a long, long time. And the Jags seemingly are just getting started.\n\nThere is one central theme to this win streak the Jaguars are on. That theme is incredible quarterback play.\n\nThe Jaguars are winners of 11 games so far this year because in the last six of them, they have had the best quarterback on the field. In the past two games alone, Lawrence has accounted for 10 total touchdowns. Lawrence hasn’t thrown a pick in four weeks. Up against one of the NFL’s best all-around defenses on the road, Lawrence went ahead and tossed for 279 yards and three touchdowns while running in a score.\n\nCoen has done an incredible job building up Lawrence into the quarterback he’s supposed to be. A ton of the credit goes there. But Coen can only do so much. At the end of the day, it’s up to Lawrence to dive for late first downs and absolutely missile balls into a receiver’s gut in the red zone.\n\nSince Week 13, Lawrence has gone for over 1,000 yards in the air. He has 14 total touchdowns. That’s winning football towards the end of the season and that’s true and utter development from the franchise QB. Lawrence’s first two touchdowns against the Broncos should have sent a shockwave through that stadium that Lawrence was there to play.\n\nThere still will be the Richard Shermans of the world who don’t watch the Jags play and don’t care to talk positively about Lawrence because in the past he has never hit this level of consistency. Ask Travon Walker how he feels about those people. For those of us who actually watch and actually are witnessing what Lawrence is doing, it’s a thing of beauty.\n\nThat win over Denver showed the Jags are a legitimate playoff team with a legitimate quarterback to lead them. It feels so nice to say that.\n\nTrevor Lawrence: Last 4 Weeks\n\n– 1,194 Yards (298.5 YPG)\n– 14 TDs\n– 0 INTs\n pic.twitter.com/ehZsuDGEFM\n\n— Daniel Griffis (@DanDGriffis) December 22, 2025\n\nIf this guy isn’t in the top two for NFL Coach of the Year, then something is wrong.\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars are Liam Coen and Liam Coen is the Jacksonville Jaguars. Teams are supposed to embody their coach, which turns out both good and bad. For the Jags, it has been extremely good in totality. The dude is taking pot shots at Sean Payton’s bitchass after the game. How much better can it get? When you watch Coen and the team celebrate after games, how can you not say that this guy hasn’t already left an indelible mark on this franchise and its current team?\n\nCase and point on how good Coen is is through watching Lawrence. There isn’t a better quarterback in football over the past four or so weeks than Lawrence. A huge reason for that is Coen and offensive coordinator Grant Udinski.\n\nThis guy is incredible and so fun to watch. He has changed what it means to cheer for the Jacksonville Jaguars, he has changed what it means to play the Jacksonville Jaguars and he has changed what it means to even talk about the Jacksonville Jaguars. This team has won 11 games and is on track to finish with 13 regular season wins and maybe even the top spot in the entire AFC.\n\nThe Jags are a legit threat in the AFC in year one of the Liam Coen era. Won 11 regular season games for the first time since 2007.\n\n— JP Acosta (@acosta32_jp) December 22, 2025\n\nIt didn’t start out great. It certainly seemed like the Broncos were keying in on Etienne after his three touchdown day a week ago. That all was for naught in the end.\n\nEtienne is playing like a man who knows he is on the precipice of life-changing money this offseason. His stat line of 50 yards rushing and 16 yards receiving isn’t ridiculously impressive but half the time it’s just the way Etienne gets the yards that matters.\n\nHe caught yet another touchdown Sunday moving him to six on the year. For the record, he had just one receiving touchdown in his three previous seasons in Duval County.\n\nDuring Coen’s time in Tampa Bay, he was seen as a guy who could unlock the running back position and make his backs better especially in the passing game. You see that in full effect with Etienne.\n\nIt was tough sledding in the run game but he still churned out over three yards a carry. At the midway point in the year, it seemed up in the air on whether or not the Jags would re-sign Etienne. At this point, it seems like a must.\n\nTravis Etienne Jr. leads all NFL running backs in TD receptions with 6⃣ this season 👏\n\n📲 Stream with NFL+pic.twitter.com/xly8AUxHVk\n\n— NFL+ (@NFLPlus) December 21, 2025\n\nIt almost feels like a joke to mention special teams sometimes, but this unit really did a great job against the Broncos.\n\nSigning this week, Deejay Dallas had an awesome 35-yard kick return on one of his two returns of the day which set up a touchdown drive. Cam Little made both of his field goals and all four extra points. But the big day was had by none other than Logan Cooke himself.\n\nCooke stepped in for six punts and put four of them within the 20-yard line. His most impressive of the day was probably his last punt down to the Denver 2-yard line to essentially end the contest.\n\nSpecial teams truly do matter and the Jags’ collection of special teamers did their part in Denver. Seeing how juiced up Coen was on Cooke’s final punt is all you need to know about how much faith the team and coaches have in this group.\n\n— Logan Cooke (@LoganCooke2) December 22, 2025\n\nParker “Parker Washington” Washington\n\nThis guy does scare me when he returns punts sometimes, but then he has games like Sunday on offense and it makes nothing else matter.\n\nCalling Washington’s day against the Broncos a monster affair would almost not be doing it justice. He led the game in receiving with 145 yards, hauled in a touchdown and took one catch for 63 yards. His 145 receiving yards were, unsurprisingly, a career high. Also unsurprisingly, Washington leads the Jags in receiving through the year with 645.\n\nThe signing of Jakobi Meyers has done wonders for this Jags team. Some of those wonders come by way of clearing the game up for guys like Washington. You can only expend so many defenders to cover everyone on offense, and eventually, you’re going to get favorable 1-on-1 matchups like we saw with Washington and Riley Moss. Advantage went to Washington by game’s end.\n\nThis hasn’t been a single-game thing either. This has been a whole year of positive development from the former Penn State receiver. I feel like there is a certain former offensive coordinator and a certain quarterback to thank for a ton of that!\n\nThe wood was chopped and the water was carried by Washington in Denver. Had Washington not stumbled late in the fourth, this easily could have been a 200-yard game for him.\n\n63-yard gain for Washington 🤯\n\n📺FOX pic.twitter.com/F7KtDZvxWT\n\n— FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) December 21, 2025\n\nOk, now that the fun stuff is over, let’s rehash some injuries because there were quite a few.\n\nOffensive linemen Robert Hainsey and Patrick Mekari both went down. It was obviously an up-and-down day for the offensive line against a great defensive line, even with these two in, but them both getting hurt is a cause for legitimate concern.\n\nCornerbacks Buster Brown, Greg Newsome and Jourdan Lewis all suffered some form of injury during the game. Newsome was out for a while but all three did come back and play. Can’t speculate, but if there is a group that is equally as banged up and thin as the offensive line, it’s the secondary.\n\nIn terms of skill players, Washington was shaken up but seemingly played through whatever was bothering him. Strange looked to be laboring a bit during the game but also played through. LeQuint Allen got evaluated for a concussion; however, he cleared protocol and returned. Lawrence got his ankle taped up after getting knocked around a bit but also didn’t seem to be too hurt. This list also doesn’t include the guys already hurt.\n\nNothing can be done immediately, but fingers have to be crossed that no one suffered anything too bad on Sunday afternoon. If the Jags are to make the playoff run it looks like they are capable of, it will take everyone to do so, especially up front on offense.\n\nLet us know your thoughts in the comments below!",

    "fullText": "Boston Bruins head coach Marco Sturm wasn’t pleased with how the team played on Sunday against the Ottawa Senators.\n\nThe Bruins entered the game coming off a shootout loss to the Vancouver Canucks on Sunday, and Boston had hoped to return to the win column.\n\nHowever, Boston struggled out of the gates as the Bruins as Ottawa led 3-0 in the first period and cruised to a lopsided 6-2 win. It was a disappointing start as Sturm wasn’t pleased with how the Bruins came out of the gates, or played the entire game.\n\n“It’s disappointing,” Sturm said on Sunday, as seen on NESN’s postgame coverage. “Just right from the start. They came out flying. They came out skating, had a lot of energy.\n\n“They outworked us right away, right from the first puck drop. And then they finished us right away in the paint.”\n\nBoston suffered its third-straight loss as the Bruins dropped a pivotal game to a division rival.\n\nWith the loss, the Bruins fell to 20-16-1 and are outside of a playoff spot. Boston defenseman Nikita Zadorov knew that was a game the Bruins had to win, especially at home.\n\n“We need to win that game,” Zadorov added. “It’s really tight in the standings, but we know where we’re at. It’s nowhere near how we want to play as well, so we’ve got to show up (for) the big rivalry game.”\n\nBoston will return to the ice on Tuesday at home against the Montreal Canadiens.\n\nBruins Call Shootout Loss To Canucks ‘Disappointing’",

    "fullText": "On Monday, La Liga published the total distribution of the television rights revenue for the 2024/25 season among clubs in the first and second divisions of Spain.\n\nThe league body has distributed €1.432 billion between the Primera and Segunda División, lower than the €1.498 billion in the 2023/24 season.\n\nAs it so happens, Real Madrid have overtaken Barcelona as the highest earners from the audiovisual rights for the 2024/25 season, despite the Catalans winning the La Liga title.\n\nIndeed, Real Madrid have received €157.52 million from the television rights for 2024/25, a slight dip from 2023/24 when they earned €159.55 million.\n\nBarcelona, meanwhile, fall from €162.49 million to €156.45 million, despite having won the league title in 2024/25.\n\nAtletico Madrid are the third club to earn the most from television rights, although they too have seen a decrease, from €117.89 million to €108.17 million.\n\nIn La Liga, 50 per cent of the money generated from the sale of television rights is shared equally among the 20 clubs.\n\nA further 25 per cent is allocated based on sporting results over the last five seasons, while the remaining 25 per cent is determined by each club’s social and commercial reach.\n\nIt must be noted that Real Madrid had the possibility of earning more money, but their confrontational stance towards La Liga worked against them.\n\nThe Merengues did not cooperate with the new audiovisual protocol, which rewards clubs that contribute to making television broadcasts richer.\n\nEssentially, clubs that allow cameras into dressing rooms more often and provide more players for pre-match, half-time and post-match interviews receive additional income.\n\nReal Madrid, believing that these spaces should be commercialised by each club rather than by La Liga, chose not to cooperate and have taken the matter to court. As a result, they have also earned less money.",

    "fullText": "When London City Lionesses sacked manager Jocelyn Precheur it sparked controversy - but they are a club who have always done things differently.\n\nWas this a harsh decision by a well-resourced club who had a desire to run before they could walk?\n\nOr was it a ruthless, strategic move to strive for long-term success from an ambitious club who are not afraid to break the norm?\n\nBBC Sport looks at the reasons why Precheur was sacked, what the club plans for the future and why Eder Maestre is lined up to take over as the new head coach.\n\nAiming for the top - Kang's dramatic impact on WSL\n\nMeet Michele Kang - the woman leading a football revolution\n\nLondon City have exploded on to the scene in England with huge investment from multi-club owner Michele Kang.\n\nWealthy businesswoman Kang owns eight-time Champions League winners Lyon and American club Washington Spirit so has a history of success.\n\nUmbrella company Kynisca oversees football and business operations for the three clubs and Markel Zubizarreta sits at the top of that as the global sporting director.\n\nLondon City, led by chief executive officer Martin Semmens, have been working on a long-term project to achieve their aims of reaching European competition by 2026 - an ambitious target for a newly promoted club.\n\nZubizarreta, Semmens and London City general manager Gonzalo Rodriguez Garcia were involved in the decision-making over Precheur's departure, and the future hiring of their new head coach, while Kang gives the ultimate go-ahead.\n\nLondon City are midway through their debut WSL season and have hit the ground running with five wins from 11 matches, putting them in sixth place.\n\nPrecheur guided them through WSL 2 and has overseen their solid start to this season - but club sources say they have been considering a new direction for a while.\n\nThe decision to sack Precheur was not based on results - the club are where they hoped to be at this stage - but because they crave a coach who can deliver a unique style of football and take their identity closer to that of Lyon's.\n\nThere was a feeling that Precheur's style would not deliver long-term success and the club intend to implement changes to its structure.\n\nIt could be a premature sacking with Precheur's experience making him a respectable figure in the women's game. He led Paris St-Germain to the Champions League semi-finals in 2024 before winning WSL 2 with London City.\n\nBut London City are not afraid of making mistakes. They genuinely believe this ruthless decision will pay dividends in the future and hope to be judged on that.\n\nWhile Precheur's impact was important during the club's infancy, there is a feeling London City are moving towards a Spanish football identity.\n\nBarcelona have dominated club football in Europe, reaching the Champions League final in six of the past seven seasons and winning the title three times.\n\nSpain's national team are currently the world champions and European runners-up.\n\nSo when former Barcelona head coach Jonatan Giraldez joined Kang's Washington Spirit in 2024, before switching to Lyon this year, it was not a huge surprise.\n\nSpanish football has a clear identity and a way of playing - heavy possession-based football with high technical skill. It is believed London City want to achieve that, as well as the traditional physicality of the English game.\n\nThe club had a shortlist of coaches they looked at to replace Precheur and did not rule out some from the men's game but appear to have ultimately chosen Maestre, who showed his potential with Spanish clubs CD Tenerife and Real Sociedad.\n\nThe main criteria for London City's next appointment is believed to have been centred around the playing style, the coach's ability to collaborate with a wider team of expertise and a track record of developing players and talented youth.\n\nWhen the appointment is confirmed, Maestre would be expected to play a role in the club's January recruitment.\n\nLondon City spent big in the summer, bringing in star names such as France international Grace Geyoro and former Lyon midfielder Danielle van de Donk.\n\nThe transfer policy this time around is believed to be about targeting future stars who can adapt to London City's new-look training programme and coaching style.\n\nThey want to be competing for silverware in the near future, and to battle the Champions League's elite, so they are shopping for future European champions.\n\nMaestre's imminent arrival is likely to be paired with the appointments of other staff members, including analysts and medical experts.\n\nWhat is clear is that London City are not here to make friends, they are here to rock the boat and are planning big things for the future.\n\nWhether it pays off or not, we will have to wait and see.\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

    "fullText": "Jake Paul survived for longer than most expected in his weekend fight against Anthony Joshua, and even though the fight came to its invariable conclusion in the sixth round when Joshua landed a right hand across Paul’s jaw that would break it in multiple places, Paul is still keeping a positive attitude about his performance and his intentions to recover and rebuild.\n\nPaul just recently underwent surgery to repair his jaw and remove some damaged teeth, saying he’ll be on a liquid diet for the next week, but he anticipates a fairly quick return to the ring at a weight class more suitable for him.\n\n“We will heal the broken jaw, come back and fight people my weight,” he said. “I’m going for the cruiserweight world title.”\n\nWhile some may credit Paul’s resolve for taking the damage he sustained and still intends to fight again, where exactly he goes from here remains a mystery. Paul’s fights have drawn massive attention while turning out not to very entertaining, and there’s no real reason to believe Paul would fare much better against world class cruiserweights if he indeed intends to pursue a world title.\n\nPaul will at least have some time to carefully choose his next adventure in the boxing ring while he heals up from this outing.",

    "fullText": "The Cincinnati Bengals will almost certainly, once again, be on the lookout for help in the defensive secondary.\n\nDon’t be surprised if the Bengals take yet another stab at finding a cornerstone cornerback in the draft after a number of misses in recent years.\n\nA recent mock draft from Sports Illustrated’s Daniel Flick has the Bengals tapping into Joe Burrow’s alma mater of LSU to grab cornerback Mansoor Delane.\n\nThe Bengals have the NFL’s worst defense, ranking last in total yards, scoring and rushing yards allowed and No. 29 in passing yards allowed. Delane is the draft’s best cornerback, and his elite instincts and route anticipation enable him to thrive in both man and zone coverages. The 6' 0\", 190-pound Delane has above-average ball skills, with two interceptions and 11 pass breakups this season, and is a physical, willing tackler in run support. He’s the complete package and should start as a rookie.\n\nDelane was a unanimous All-American and First-Team All-SEC in 2025. He recorded 45 tackles and two interceptions this season and just recently officially declared for the draft.\n\nThe Bengals have DJ Turner and Dax Hill as long-term options. But the Cam Taylor-Britt experiment is over and the search for higher-end prospects will start once again.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Bengals Wire: Bengals won't make fans happy in top 10 NFL mock draft",

    "description": "Let’s take a look at some key stats from the Jaguars 34-20 victory over Denver.",
    "fullText": "The Jaguars stood a mile-tall in Mile High, besting the first place Denver Broncos, who held an 11-game win streak entering Sunday. As the Broncos streak snaps, the Jaguars own win streak only grows longer, now at six straight. The team now sits at 11 wins for the first time since 2007 with an opportunity for more.\n\nLet’s take a look at some key stats from the Jaguars 34-20 victory over Denver.\n\nWhat more can you ask of your franchise quarterback? Since the bye, Trevor Lawrence has been as good as it gets, particularly so in the last four weeks. Lawrence is now third in the NFL in touchdowns (33) with an opportunity to break the franchise record set by Blake Bortles (37) in 2016.\n\n“Trevor Lawrence completed 23 of 36 passes for 279 yards and 3 touchdowns in the Jaguars’ Week 16 win over the Broncos despite being pressured on 48.8% of his dropbacks, the 4th-highest rate of his career,” according to NextGenStats.\n\nWhile Lawrence was pressured often, he tore apart Denver’s blitzes. Lawrence completed 12 of 15 passes for 129 yards, and two touchdowns. If Lawrence can continue this hot streak into the playoffs, watch out. He now has a total of 1,194 yards, 14 touchdowns and zero turnovers over the last four games.\n\nThose familiar with Harry Potter will get the reference; Parker Washington is Jacksonville’s very own room of requirement. Whenever the Jaguars need someone to step up and make a play for them, Parker Washington is right there to save the day. It was no different against the Broncos.\n\nParker Washington set a new career-high with 145 yards on six receptions, including a crafty touchdown grab. His 90 yards after the catch were the fourth most by a Jaguar since 2016, while his +70 YAC over expectation are the most by any player this season.\n\nHe was particularly deadly outside the numbers. His 140 yards outside the numbers against the Broncos is the most by any player this season. It’s almost ironic as it’s been the Jaguars ability to attack defenses over the middle that has been their M.O. lately. It just shows another instance of Liam Coen and the Jaguars continuing to evolve as needed.\n\nMontaric Brown is in many ways, the defensive counterpart to Parker Washington. Originally a depth, rotational piece, both now have proven themselves to be reliable playmakers for the team. He even delivered the game-ending pass breakup, sadly injuring the Broncos’ Pat Bryant in the process.\n\nAgainst the Broncos, Brown was targeted just twice, allowing zero receptions with two passes defensed. His 5.1% target rate was also a season-low for Brown. According to NextGenStats, Brown leads the Jaguars with a 18.2% ball-hawk rate this season and a 13.6% target rate, lowest among Jacksonville cornerbacks.\n\n>>> STREAM ACTION SPORTS JAX 24/7 LIVE <<<\n\n[DOWNLOAD: Free Action News Jax app for alerts as news breaks]\n\n[SIGN UP: Action News Jax Daily Headlines Newsletter]",

    "fullText": "Derrick White has put his early-season slump behind him. The Boston Celtics guard has been impressive in recent weeks, as he’s adjusted to his larger role. White is Boston’s secondary option on offense, along with being one of the team’s primary playmakers.\n\nDuring Boston’s 112-96 win over the Toronto Raptors on Saturday, Dec. 20, White was once again one of the best players on the court. He ended the game with 15 points, 7 assists, 5 rebounds and a block. And despite going 5-of-20 from the field, he provided a level of connectivity that allowed those around him to thrive.\n\nDuring his postgame news conference, Raptors head coach Darko Rajakovic shared a familiar statement regarding White.\n\n“I think Derrick White is the most underrated player in the league,” Rajakovic said, per Gary Washburn. “He’s an unbelievable player.”\n\nInterestingly, Rajakovic’s comments echoed Erik Spoelstra’s. The Miami Heat head coach had shared a similar message regarding the Celtics guard just 24 hours earlier, after White helped Joe Mazzulla’s team secure a 129-116 win over the Miami Heat.\n\n“I think he is the most underrated player in the league,” Spoelstra said. “The guy is an absolute winner, whatever role you put him in. Tonight, obviously, he showed to be a scorer in all the different facets … Defensively, he just does so many things … He’s the best shot-blocking guard in the league.”\n\nWhite is playing at a borderline All-Star level. Coming into the season, Celtics fans knew he would be an important part of the rotation. However, White is surpassing expectations, as he continues to help spearhead an offense that misses Jayson Tatum.\n\nIf White continues to play at his current level, it wouldn’t be too much of a stretch to proposed that he emerges as a surprise candidate to make the 2026 All-Star game.\n\nCeltics Legend Robert Parish Names His Top Five NBA Coaches Of All Time",

    "description": "The Lions were left in disbelief after losing in Week 16 on the final play of the game.",
    "fullText": "Down five points, the Detroit Lions had one more play to try and secure a comeback win over the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 16. There was a lot at stake, as a loss would sink the Lions' playoff hopes.\n\nOn the game's final play ... chaos erupted. Lions wideout Amon-Ra St. Brown caught a pass short of the goal line, but then lateraled the ball to quarterback Jared Goff before being tackled. Goff ran the ball into the end zone for a possible game-winning touchdown, but there were flags on the field.\n\nAfter a lengthy, lengthy chat involving all the officials, it was determined that the Lions scored on the play, but that St. Brown committed offensive pass interference before that touchdown. As a result, the touchdown was taken off the board and the game was over. The Lions lost, crushing their postseason chances.\n\nIt was an incredibly frustrating way to lose a game and — given everything at stake — you might expect that the Lions were none too happy about the final call that resulted in them losing the contest.\n\nBut that's not the case. After the game, Lions coach Dan Campbell took responsibility for the loss, saying the team should not have put itself in a position where it needed a last-second play to win the game, per ESPN.\n\n\"We weren't able to close it out. And at the end of the day, that's on us,\" Campbell said. \"We did that. We're the ones who put ourselves in that position to where we had to try to score on the last play.\"\n\nQuarterback Jared Goff took a similar track. While he said he disagreed with an earlier call that wiped a Lions touchdown off the board, Goff admitted the Lions have been beneficiaries of that type of call in the past.\n\n\"[The officials] have a hard job, and I don't want to make any excuses or anything like that. We've been on the right side of a lot of these, and we've been on the wrong side on a lot of these,\" said Goff, who threw for 364 yards and three touchdowns. \"I think a few plays prior, the one on [Isaac] TeSlaa was a little bit \n\nEarlier in the drive, the Lions appeared to score a go-ahead touchdown on a pass to St. Brown. But the officials ruled that TeSlaa set a pick on a defender, which allowed St. Brown to be wide open in the end zone. That touchdown was also taken off the board, leading to the Lions' last-ditch attempt ... which was also taken off the board for offensive pass interference.\n\nThe loss makes it really hard for the Lions to make the playoffs now. Following the loss, the team sits at 8-7, with an eight-percent chance of securing a spot in the postseason, per NFL.com. For the Lions to get in, the team would need to win its next two games. The Lions play the Minnesota Vikings in Week 17 and the Chicago Bears in Week 18. But Detroit would also need the Green Bay Packers to lose their final two remaining games. The Packers play the Baltimore Ravens in Week 17 and the Vikings in Week 18. While that's possible, the odds are against Detroit.\n\nIt's been a disappointing season for the Lions. Despite once again posting excellent offensive numbers, the Lions have already lost five more games compared to last season. After securing the No. 1 seed in the NFC last year, the Lions sit in third place in the NFC North and could fall to fourth place in the division before the year is over.\n\nIf the Lions lose to the Vikings on Christmas, Detroit would fall behind Minnesota in the division. The Vikings won the earlier matchup against the Lions, beating Detroit 27-24 in Week 9.\n\nThat's a far cry from where the Lions thought they would be at the start of the season. Detroit entered the year as one of the top Super Bowl contenders in the NFL. Finishing third — or fourth — in their division would be a massive disappointment.\n\nDespite that, the Lions are in pretty decent shape moving forward. Many of the team's key players are set to return in 2026. And if the Lions wind up playing an easier schedule next season, the team could find itself back on top of the division before long.\n\nThe 2025 NFL season has definitely been a let down, but the Lions' time at the bottom of the division looks temporary.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe cameras caught the moment, one that the on-field officials likely didn't see.\n\nPittsburgh Steelers star WR DK Metcalf feuded with a Detroit Lions fan during Sunday's game at Ford Field, and the interaction ended with Metcalf appearing to shove the fan with a near-punching motion.\n\nMetcalf wasn't ejected from the game, which you can understand from the perspective of the officials at the game not having seen it.\n\nBut according to ESPN's Dan Graziano, the league office can contact the officials and issue an ejection from afar.\n\nThat didn't happen here, and Graziano explained why in a new article on Monday.\n\n\"I was stunned that Metcalf wasn't ejected, because I know the league office can contact officials and order an ejection in cases when the league believes one is warranted, even if the officials don't do it themselves,\" Graziano wrote. \"So, I reached out to the league and asked, and the explanation I got was that, because no flag was thrown, the league is not allowed to weigh in on disqualification.

    "description": "Plus, the AEW boss breaks down what goes into crafting the Continental Classic tournament.",
    "fullText": "When you’re Tony Khan, the greatest gift this holiday season is watching fans enjoy All Elite Wrestling. The founder, CEO, and overall creative visionary of the relatively young company launched in 2019. Since then it has become a popular staple of the Warner Bros. Discovery networks’ portfolio, so much so that the conclusion of A Christmas Story 24-hour marathon on TNT will lead to Christmas Collision. Santa Khan also presents Dynamite on 34th Street during Christmas Eve programming on TBS.\n\nThe one-two holiday punch leads into AEW Worlds End, the last pay-per-view of the year. It’s set to feature the semifinals and finals of Continental Classic. A tournament carefully crafted by Khan, featuring a mix of top and emerging talent. The event has become an annual tradition. For the boss, it’s a nice way to wrap up 2025. One he’d give his trademark “justified this is awesome chants” after being dubbed “Promotion of the Year” by Sports Illustrated.\n\n“I was so pleased that Sports Illustrated, a renowned publication I’ve been reading since I was six years old in the school library, selected AEW as 2025’s top pro wrestling promotion of the year,” Khan said. This is along with a bevy of other honors for individuals and teams and rivals.”\n\nThis provides further motivation to deliver at Worlds End. Ahead of the show, we caught up with the head honcho.\n\nThis Continental Classic is so intricate with Blue and Gold leagues and point system. What is your approach to booking these tournaments every year?\n\nTony Khan: Coming out of Wrestle Dream into Full Gear, I have thoughts about who will be in the tournament. I’m updating week to week and monitoring the injuries because it’s such a hard hitting sport. One injury could be very impactful in the planning. I put all the names in my notebook and am constantly thinking about it. I have a good plan going into Full Gear for what I want to do and coming out of Full Gear. I evaluate the health of the wrestlers and then make necessary changes to the draft I made before Full Gear in the months of October and November. I work through the scenarios. There was an injury this year that led to a lot of changes to scheduling.\n\nHow was it having to adjust after Darby Allin got injured?\n\nIt was a serious enough injury at the time that Darby Allin had. He is one of the toughest people in the world in my opinion and had to step out of the tournament. He didn’t want to be taken out. The doctors felt that he shouldn’t continue. It was certainly from an accumulation of injuries from all the crazy things he has done in the ring and outside the ring, ringside area and backstage and all the crazy fights we’ve seen Darby in. They take its toll. On the first night of the tournament he had a match with Kevin Knight. It was actually on Thanksgiving Eve. I always love spending time with Darby, but I hadn’t planned to spend my Thanksgiving morning in the hospital with Darby. I gave him every opportunity over the next week to get cleared. But I was very skeptical he should participate.\n\nI think a great choice as an alternate is “Jungle” Jack Perry, who was very eager to do the tournament. It has worked out very well…When it comes to planning the Continental Classic, I go home. I have a lot of homes. Because of filming that night, it was around Nashville, and I went home to Chicago and spread papers and ideas all over the desk or sometimes on the floor. I spread all the papers out and ran all the different combinations and scheduling. With Darby being injured, and Jack coming in, it absolutely changed the schedule around. I thought about it for months and the order of the matches, which affected all the wrestlers in the Gold and Blue leagues. One injury can change anything, but there are multiple silver linings because Darby will be okay and going to be back. We did the right thing to take him out to rest and recover in my opinion. “Jungle” Jack has been a fantastic replacement.\n\nWhat I love about this tournament is it gives young talent such as “Speedball” Mike Bailey the opportunity to break out.\n\nAbsolutely. I was so excited to have “Speedball” Bailey and his partner Kevin Knight. Both members of JetSpeed are awesome as a tandem but also individual members. They had a fantastic match against each other in the tournament in the competitive spirit of the Continental Classic. I think AEW has had a tremendous 2025, and I think it’s very fitting we built this annual tradition in the Continental Classic tournament that fans look forward to. I hope this ends up being the best one yet.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the developments regarding the future of Warner Bros. Discovery? How do you take in this uncertainty?\n\nI think we have a lot of certainty and are very excited. 2025 is the most exciting year yet for AEW and our partnership with Warner Bros. Discovery was reimagined this year and will continue for years to come. We’re locked in with TNT, TBS, and HBO Max for over two more years. The future is bright for us for years to come. The person who is making the calls and always been a believer in AEW and continues to be is [President and CEO] David Zaslav. I just got a very nice holiday from him in fact that I will be utilizing in some fun ways in the weeks to come. The man who first asked me to launch AEW Collision and bring more wrestling back to TNT along with the great Dynamite on TBS, which is our flagship show. It’s the longest running primetime professional wrestling show in the history of TBS and TNT. Turner, in my opinion, has the richest collective history of professional wrestling with a tradition that goes back on TBS to 1971.\n\nThen after 20 years of no wrestling on TBS we brought it back and had Dynamite become the longest running primetime wrestling show ever on TBS and TNT. Mr. Zaslav had the idea to launch AEW on HBO Max to make the pay-per-views available to its massive audience and add new fans to AEW and HBO Max. Subscribers have the extra incentive with Dynamite and Collision and the library. That deal is continuing for years to come. I know the job Mr. Zaslav has done running Warner Bros. this year that people are going to want Mr. Zaslav as a studio boss in any regime. He has been one of the most successful studio heads in the history of Hollywood. The numbers don’t lie. David Zaslav is putting out hit after hit. I’m very proud he has made the big investment in AEW. There is a lot of excitement around the future of Warner Bros. It’s certainly one of the most exciting stories on Wall Street. There are a lot of exciting things happening around Warner Bros. that I’m proud AEW will be associated with Warner Bros.\n\nMercedes Moné (Ricky Havlik/AEW)\n\nThis year we’ve also seen some great growth in the AEW women’s division. Talk about how you’ve made this a priority, even introducing AEW Women’s Tag Team titles and having the first women’s Blood & Guts match.\n\nI’m very excited about AEW women’s wrestling in 2025 and going into 2026. I think it’s the best women’s wrestling we’ve ever had. When we launched AEW over six years ago we started with a small group of wrestlers and built up our roster and built up our women’s wrestling. Our small group did a fantastic job establishing women’s wrestling in AEW. I made it a focus for years to try to accumulate the best wrestlers in the world. We had a big focus on finding the best women’s wrestlers. So many of the top stars are wrestlers we signed along the way. The tag team tournament for the Women’s Tag Team Champions is the perfect example. There is the TBS Champion Mercedes Moné, “Timeless” Toni Storm, great free agents who have signed with us along the way. They had an incredible match at All In in Texas as singles competitors, but also competed in the tag team tournament teaming with two stars that are incredible in ROH Women’s Champion for over three years Athena and Toni Storm’s partner Mina Shirakawa.\n\nThere are also homegrown talents that have developed. The Women’s Champion Kris Statlander is someone that has been there since the beginning, but she has risen and developed to be one of the top stars as a fantastic champion. Her opponent at Worlds End Jamie Hayter was there from the beginning but was away in England during the pandemic and came back after the COVID lockdown in better form than ever. She was out with injuries for some time but came back to be a top star. I’m so excited to have two AEW originals in a division where we’ve seen great free agents coming into compete at a top level. The Women’s Tag Team Championship match at Worlds End has four stars who were not on the first AEW shows but joined us along the way with Mercedes Moné and Athena facing the “Babes of Wrath.” That has Willow Nightingale, a former TBS Champion herself and has come so far since the Daily’s Place days and risen to be a champion and now first-ever tag team champion teaming with a popular star in Harley Cameron. Harley has risen and developed and is another great example of women’s wrestling in AEW.\n\nHow is it having MJF back in the fold and inserted in the AEW Championship match at Worlds End?\n\nAs we’ve been in this holiday season there has been so much excitement and unpredictability around the AEW World Championship. Last week at the “Holiday Bash” event in Manchester, the picture looked very exciting. We’ve got the AEW World Champion, the first-ever double champion in AEW history the Word Trios and AEW World Champion now for the second time Samoa Joe. In my mind, one of the all-time great wrestlers. He had a tremendous defense of the championship at “Winter Is Coming” Dynamite in a match I always wanted to see and delivered with Eddie Kingston. Now Samoa Joe has to face two men he knows very well in the ring and also know the AEW world champion. Hangman Page, the man Samoa Joe plotted to take the AEW World Championship from after Joe was instrumental in helping him win this championship. Page is also a two-time champion. One of Samoa Joe’s greatest rivals and who has been through hell with Hangman Page and fought beside him as well, Swerve Strickland is in there, too.\n\nSwerve was put out for months, but returned and actually stood for the first time with his generational rival Hangman Page. Swerve returned to the picture in fine form looking better than ever. It looked to be a rematch from Revolution 2024 where we set all the records in Greensboro. Then we did see what was unexpected for many fans in the return of MJF, Maxwell Jacob Freedman who had been clinging to this opportunity that he earned in AEW All In Texas for a contract to challenge for the championship. I made it clear to properly advertise and prepare for these shows and deliver world championship matches at the highest level there needs to be and has been given proper notice. So I did know for this to be finalized.\n\nMJF is back and has got his own rivalries. There was the one who took the championship from him at World’s End two years earlier and holds the championship now, Samoa Joe. MJF wisely returned to a contract signing segment for AEW “Holiday Bash” this past week when there was no physicality allowed or competitors. It’s going to be a fantastic pay-per-view. I’m excited for Worlds End this weekend and thrilled about that four-way for the world championship as part of this big Christmas week.\n\nSpeaking of Christmas, do you have any traditions at home?\n\nI love to spend Christmas with my family. I end up having work to do during the day, but I still have spent every Christmas with my parents and sister. This year I’ll be watching Christmas Eve Dynamite on TBS and HBO Max with my family. I’ll have the TV going with TBS and may even put on an iPad with HBO Max. We’ll have Christmas night watching Collision on TNT an HBO Max. We’ll also watch Die Hard. Sometimes on Christmas Eve, and sometimes on Christmas. One or the other, we always watch Die Hard. We think it’s a Christmas movie in my family. It’s why we watch it every Christmas. We usually spend the holidays in Champagne, Illinois or Chicago, Illinois. That’s very appropriate because World’s End is in the Chicagoland area at Hoffman Estates just outside the city of Chicago. I’ll be spending my whole Christmas week in Chicago. It’s going to be a great one. We usually watch football, watch Diehard, and AEW.\n\nDie Hard does check all the boxes to be a Christmas movie.\n\nIt’s so on the nose! It starts with Christmas music and bookends with Christmas music. It’s set in a Christmas party…”Now I have a machine gun, ho-ho-ho.” There are countless reasons why I believe in my personal opinion that Die Hard is a Christmas movie. That’s the opinion of me and my family. That’s why we watch it every year.\n\nAEW Dynamite on 34th Street, December 24, 6/5c, TBS and HBO Max\n\nAEW Christmas Collision, December 25, 9/8c, TNT and HBO Max\n\nRead the latest entertainment news on TV Insider.",

    "fullText": "South Carolina quarterback Air Noland plans to enter the transfer portal, On3’s Pete Nakos reports.\n\nNoland has spent one season apiece at two programs, as he redshirted at Ohio State, as part of a team for the Buckeyes that won the national title in the College Football Playoff, before coming to South Carolina. He then made his first career appearances this past fall as a backup for the Gamecocks.\n\nAfter not playing while in Columbus, Noland appeared off the sideline in two non-conference wins, one early in the year and one late, this season in Columbia. He came off the sideline in wins over South Carolina State in September and Coastal Carolina in November, as he is 2-3 (66.7%) for 13 yards while also having a rush for four yards.\n\nA native of College Park, Georgia, Noland played his high school football at Langston Hughes in Fairburn. He ranked as a Top-60 overall recruit there and as a four-star prospect in the 2024 recruiting cycle. He also rated as the No. 5 QB in the class and as a Top-10 player out of the state of Georgia. That’s according to Rivals’ Industry Ranking, a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies. He’d then arrive as one of the top signees for the Buckeyes in what was the No. 4 class in the country per Rivals’ Industry Team Recruiting Rankings.\n\nHowever, Noland has yet to be able to win a starting job to this point early in his career. He wasn’t expected to start last year at Ohio State, behind names like Will Howard, Devin Brown, Julian Sayin, and Lincoln Kienholz, as well as the eventual arrival the next offseason of Tavien St. Clair. However, after a year of backing up LaNorris Sellers, Noland likely expected to take the job for the Gamecocks as early as next fall, but Sellers is now anticipated to stay for another season at South Carolina rather than entering his name into the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nNoland has yet to get a real opportunity through two seasons at two programs in his collegiate career. He’ll now be looking for that in his third team in as many years, being a redshirt sophomore there with three years of eligibility remaining wherever he ends up next, once his name is officially in come the opening of the portal’s two-week window on January 2nd.\n\nTo keep up with the latest players on the move, check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.\n\nThe On3 Transfer Portal Instagram account and Twitter account are excellent resources to stay up to date with the latest moves.",

    "description": "Joel Smyth takes you through eight important stats that may go overlooked going into your fantasy football championship.",
    "fullText": "Each Monday, fantasy football analyst Joel Smyth will go over eight important stats that you may have overlooked from this week. Week 16 had plenty of notable stats. What keys to fantasy success do you need to know that your leaguemates may have missed?​\n\nRoutes run for Emeka Egbuka on Sunday, the lowest of his rookie season. With Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan fully healthy, both WRs played more than the struggling Egbuka in Week 16. The QB efficiency hasn’t bounced back upon the Buccaneers receivers return. To begin the year, Egbuka was excelling not because of the incredible volume he saw as Tampa Bay’s lone healthy wideout, but because of top-notch efficiency. Now, the rookie has neither. In his two games back, Evans has a league-high 40.4% targets per route.​\n\nWith Egbuka being fourth in line for a struggling Bucs’ passing attack, he is no longer in the flex range for managers hoping for a bounce-back week. Since the Week 9 bye, Tampa Bay ranks 24th in receiving fantasy PPG produced. Even when facing a weak Miami secondary in Week 17, there isn’t much positive to hold on to for any Buccaneers passing weapons outside of Evans.\n\nThe carry + target advantage for Omarion Hampton over Kimani Vidal. In the first two weeks since Hampton’s return, it was a near-perfect 50/50 split at 31-30. With the offensive line struggles and lack of receiving volume, Hampton needs the bellcow volume to produce as he did on Sunday vs. the Cowboys. The difference between receiving 18 of the 23 touches compared to Vidal, rather than the usual 12 of the 23, is the difference between a great RB2 and a weak flex, based on his points per touch on the day.\n\nThe Cowboys without Quinnen Williams aren’t the same as the Texans defense Hampton will face in the fantasy championship, but Week 16 should give some hope. Fellow rookie first-round RB Ashton Jeanty scored over 30 fantasy points in Week 16 against the Texans defense, which was the best against the position when compared to their schedule. A close score in a home game could help Hampton’s success greatly next Saturday.​\n\nShout out to Omarion Hampton today:\n-16 carries \n-85 yards \n-5.3 per carry-first game over 5+ yards per attempt since Week 4\n-1 TD\n-2 receptions for 10 yards \n\n😤 pic.twitter.com/woJVpOb75K\n\n— Alex Insdorf (@alexinsdorf99) December 21, 2025\n\nFantasy PPG for Ashton Jeanty in the Raiders’ six games where they didn’t lose by over three points. In his other games, the rookie has averaged only 10.5 points. When they keep it close, Jeanty becomes the focus, shown by his 25 touches on Sunday versus the best defense in the NFL. I don’t use this stat only because of the Raiders losing by two against a dominant Texans defense, but because of their Week 17 matchup.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Houston was No. 1 versus RB compared to their schedule this season. The Giants, the Raiders next matchup, entered the week ranked 31st. Las Vegas has a shot to have its seventh close game of the season, as the Raiders are only 2.5 points underdogs at home to New York. Jeanty can be a much more confident start in Week 17 for those who survived the 31-0 blowout to the Eagles in Week 15.\n\nAshton Jeanty is the first player in over a decade to have a game with:\n\n• 50+ YD Receiving TD\n• 50+ YD Rushing TD pic.twitter.com/xw7xouLjDc\n\n— Real Sports (@realapp) December 22, 2025\n\nOf routes run for Drake London. It wasn’t the day people hoped for coming off injury, but London’s volume was back to normal. In a Zac Robinson offense, Kirk Cousins has kept the philosophy of having a heavy focus on the star players. Bijan Robinson with 11 targets, Kyle Pitts with nine and London with eight. No other player had more than two targets. London may have been out-targeted by Pitts, but his downfield targets should pan out better than they did on Sunday.\n\nLondon’s 26.7% targets per route were the best among Atlanta wide receivers and tight ends, however. Next week, the Falcons play the Rams, who have fallen off in terms of passing fantasy PPG allowed as of late. I could very well see it going like the Rams’ Week 14 matchup versus a struggling Cardinals team. Arizona lost 45-17, but it didn’t stop Michael Wilson and Trey McBride from posting 200 receiving yards. For what it’s worth, London’s last poor game came in Week 7 versus San Francisco. In Week 8, he scored 34.3 points.\n\nFantasy points for Taysom Hill in Week 15. The best thing about a good Taysom Hill is the fact that the QB-RB hybrid counts as a TE, the most difficult fantasy position to find real value at. The key here is the absence of Devin Neal and Alvin Kamara. The Saints pivoted to their triple threat “TE” by giving Hill 12 carries, six targets and a passing attempt that went for a 38-yard TD to Chris Olave. Fantasy TEs are all about TDs, and Hill’s red-zone usage makes him one of the best shots.\n\nAnother reason, outside of volume, that Hill played great in Week 15 was the Jets defense. New York allows over 28 points scored per game to opposing offenses, yet the Titans, the Saints' Week 17 matchup, are less than two points better. Hill has multiple games of 15+ fantasy points in every season since 2019; he just got his first of 2025.\n\nFantasy PPG by Steelers RBs since Week 11, the second–most in the NFL to Detroit. Kenneth Gainwell and Jaylen Warren have been a dominant duo with Aaron Rodgers. Pittsburgh is second to only CMC and the 49ers in RB target share this season, as 25% of Rodgers passes go to backs. It most importantly helps their consistency. In their last five weeks, each RB has scored 12+ fantasy points in four out of five games. Gainwell specifically has been the fantasy RB10 since Week 10.\n\nWith likely no DK Metcalf in Week 17, the Pittsburgh running backs may become even more of a focus. Although the Steelers duo combined for under 100 scrimmage yards in their last matchup against Cleveland, this has not been the same Browns defense. Since the bye in Week 9, Cleveland ranks last (32nd) in fantasy points allowed to RB. Both running backs can be trusted as the Steelers continue their playoff push.\n\nKENNETH GAINWELL ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?! 😳\n\nOne of the best plays of the season 🔥\n\n(via @steelers)pic.twitter.com/GZpmYw04Yc\n\n— SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) December 21, 2025\n\nRB touches for Josh Jacobs following his third-quarter fumble. After entering Week 16 against Chicago on Saturday without practicing, Jacobs finished his day with 12 carries for 36 yards. The key for Week 17 is watching his practice report. In weeks past, when Jacobs had produced while injured, the Packers were allowing him to practice in limited fashion throughout the week. Only in Week 16 did Jacobs fully rest up until game time.\n\nOnce he fumbled in the third quarter, the injured back played just two snaps in the fourth quarter without receiving a touch. It can be a scary start against a Ravens defense that has dominated on the ground in the second half of their season. Since their Week 7 bye, the Ravens defense has allowed just 11.7 rushing fantasy PPG, the lowest in the NFL. With Jacobs value relying on his rushing touchdowns, it's a concerning matchup with Baltimore, which has allowed two rushing touchdowns to RB in the last six games.\n\nJosh Jacobs practices & playing time:\nWK14: LP-LP-FP ➡️ 53% snaps, 14.4 xFPs\nWK15: DNP-DNP-LP ➡️ 54%, 10.1\nWK16: DNP-DNP-DNP ➡️ \"pitch count\"\n\nI have him as RB15, so downgraded vs norm. https://t.co/EwFql7QWPy\n\n— Hayden Winks (@HaydenWinks) December 20, 2025\n\nFantasy points per snap for Breece Hall with Brady Cook at QB, which would be last among RBs on the season. Rushing volume can only take you so far. I say rushing because Hall’s once game-changing receiving upside has been nonexistent in 2025. Hall hasn’t had a game of 5+ targets since Week 5. The Jets’ star RB has a TD on under 2% of his touches this season, and his odds aren’t getting any better.\n\nNew York has already played New England in Week 11, when Hall had 14 carries for 58 yards along with two receptions for six yards. I would not be shocked to see Hall held under 10 fantasy points once again, and for the fourth straight week.",

Following Sunday's games in Week 16, there are now eight teams within one game of having the league's best record, and the San Francisco 49ers could make it nine by Monday night's end. The two teams sitting atop last week's rankings both lost, with the Denver Broncos losing by 14 points at home after standing alone as the best record.\n\nThings are shaping up for an incredible playoff season and with two weeks remaining, seeds are more up for grabs than ever. Meanwhile, if the top if heavy, the bottom is as well. There are seven teams with four wins or fewer, stinking up the joint each and every week.

Detroit opened as a 5.5-point road favorite, and some books are already up to -6.

    "description": "Todd Bowles may have sealed his deal as this season being his last as head coach for the Bucs after Week 16.",
    "fullText": "The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are spiraling down towards the end of their season as they grasp for a backup parachute on the way down to a crash landing. Instead what they are getting is nothing but a cold, frozen ground to break their fall and turn into a debris field of what they once were.\n\nThe man at the center of all of this is head coach Todd Bowles. The team has now lost three straight division games and is in second place in the division following a Week 16 loss to the Panthers. After starting the season 5-1, the Bucs are now 7-8, and everyone is looking for answers as to why they are collapsing.\n\nBleacher Report's Brent Sobleski wrote up his selections for Winners and Losers from Week 16 and when it came to the Bucs, the \"loser\" was Todd Bowles.\n\nSobleski writes, \"Bowles' previous comments were meant to serve as a rallying cry. Instead, the team came out flat and lost yet another game. Eventually, the arrow is going to point toward the head coach since he can't get his squad out of its current funk. Granted, a division title remains in play. If the Bucs can't end their current losing streak before the season ends, it's easy to imagine the organization going in another direction with the coaching staff, even after three straight division titles.\"\n\nThe Glazer family has moved on from coaches while winning, so it should be easy for them to move on from Bowles, right? The team needs a new voice; they need someone to motivate them, because at this point, we are seeing that this team is simply not motivated, and that falls back on Bowles.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Bucs Wire: Todd Bowles labeled a 'loser' coming out of Week 16 loss",

    "description": "At 8-6, the Colts are on the outside looking in at the playoff picture, but 44-year-old Philip Rivers coming in off the couch is one of the great stories of this NFL season.",
    "fullText": "Just think, for a moment, how you’d look in a pair of form-fitting football pants and a tight-around-the-belly jersey. Would you look like a honed specimen of humanity, lean and taut and ready to explode? Or would you look like 10 pounds of sausage in a five-pound casing, busting the seams?\n\nIf you’re being honest, you, me, and pretty much everyone both of us knows would look a whole lot more like a sausage than a specimen. A whole lot like Philip Rivers does, honestly.\n\nBut the difference between Philip Rivers and us, of course, is that we aren’t starting at quarterback on Monday Night Football.\n\nRivers and the briefly-mighty, now-floundering Indianapolis Colts take on the San Francisco 49ers in a matchup that, from a sheer talent standpoint, looked a whole lot more attractive back in September than it does now. Ball-knowers will scoff at Rivers and wonder who in the world would want to watch a 44-year-old grandfather run around for three hours.\n\nTo which I would say: Everyone. Everyone would love to see that. Because what Rivers is doing is both awesome and ridiculous.\n\nIn any other career, Rivers would be hitting his prime at age 44, old enough to have learned the ropes but young enough to have the energy and desire to do more. In sports, though, he’s impossibly ancient, a relic who could burst into a pile of dust with one good sack. Hopefully he won’t, but that’s the line on most aged pro athletes.\n\nPlayers like Tom Brady and LeBron James have redefined the possible parameters of a late-career athlete, but then again, Tom Brady and LeBron James are arguably the GOATs of their respective sports. They played for such a high level for so long that their age-related decline merely brought them down to star level.\n\nRivers wasn’t ever in that stratosphere, though he had a few years in the mid-2000s — you know, about two decades ago — when he garnered some Pro Bowl nods and MVP votes. He ran with all the speed of the changing seasons, yes, but he also possessed two valuable attributes — an orbital-launch arm and a surpassing knowledge of potential defensive schemes.\n\nThat’s how he was able to come back and mesh with the Colts so quickly last week against Seattle. He played within himself, tossing a nifty 18 of 27 completions for 160 yards, with a long of just 17 yards. He had an adjusted yards gained per pass attempt of 3.52 — quite the falloff from the 8- to 9-yard average of his best days. Against San Francisco, he could fare even better; the 49ers trail Seattle in every major defensive category.\n\nBut stats are for nerds. What Grandpa Rivers did last week was ball, plain and simple. And now he’s getting a chance to take Indy on a last-ditch playoff run? Come on, how can you not love this?\n\nAt 8-6, Indianapolis sits in the dreaded first-team-out spot, well behind 10-5 division rival Houston for the final spot in the AFC playoffs. After this week, the Colts have games against the Texans and Jaguars, both teams they’re staring up at in the playoff bracket. The Athletic gives Indianapolis just a 3 percent chance of making the playoffs, which is a rough prognosis given the Colts’ 7-1 start to 2025.\n\nThat’s tough news for the franchise and the city, but on a micro level, a great story is unfolding. Rivers is the embodiment of every former football player — whether high school, college or just two-hand touch Turkey Bowl — who would love to get one more turn in the arena, one more play with the ball in their hands, one more chance to rear back and throw it deep. He’s living the dream that if you keep in shape, if you keep your edge — if not your waistline — then maybe, just maybe, they’ll call your number one more time. Father Time is undefeated, yes, but you can always move the ball against him if you want it badly enough.\n\nRivers’ return is a hell of a story, however it ends. But it’d be nice if he went out with at least one more victory. Why not a prime-time one?",

    "fullText": "Red Bull GmbH managing director Oliver Mintzlaff is not concerned about Max Verstappen's contract clauses with the Milton Keynes outfit.\n\nWhile the Dutchman is under contract with Red Bull until the end of 2028, it is understood that there are contract clauses that would allow Verstappen to leave the team early.\n\nDiscussions with Mercedes Formula 1 team principal and CEO Toto Wolff led to rumours of the four-time champion eyeing a move to the Brackley squad for 2026, but Verstappen later closed the door on his exit as he reiterated his commitment to Red Bull for next year.\n\n\"What's important to say is that I'm not afraid of any performance clause in his contract. The most important thing for an athlete is that he sees that everyone on the team is giving their all for him. And I think Max is impressed with the way the results and the atmosphere in the team have gone this year,\" Mintzlaff told De Telegraaf.\n\n\"Of course, Max always wants to win and have the best possible car, but so do we. As long as Max feels we're working towards it and doing everything we can, I think he'll stay loyal. He also sees how much we've invested in our own engine.\n\n\"Don't forget that we're an energy drink brand, and what a unique step this is. I feel there's enormous appreciation and loyalty on both sides. I have no doubt that Max Verstappen will finish his career at Red Bull.\"\n\n2026 welcomes a new wave of regulations for F1, which will act as a reset button for the grid. Verstappen previously confirmed that he would consider retiring if he did not find the new regulations fun.\n\n\"My contract runs until 2028 but it [his future] will depend on the new rules in 2026, and if they are nice and fun,\" he told PA ahead of the 2025 Qatar Grand Prix.\n\n\"If they are not fun, then I don't really see myself hanging around. Winning seven titles is not on my mind. I know that there are three more years after this one, so it could be possible, but it is not something I need to do before I leave the sport. I can leave the sport easily tomorrow.\"\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "After finalizing the signings of Fausto Vera and Aníbal Moreno, River Plate continues its momentum in the transfer market. The management, led by Stefano Di Carlo, has made a formal offer to San Lorenzo for Jhohan Romaña, the Colombian central defender who has become Marcelo Gallardo's priority to restructure the back line.\n\nThe \"Millonario\" proposal consists of 2 million dollars for 50% of the defender's transfer, along with the loan of Sebastián Boselli. There is marked optimism in Núñez, as the financial figures are close to what the Boedo club is seeking to part with one of its stars.\n\nThe search for a central defender is no coincidence. Gallardo's team faces a complex scenario following Germán Pezzella's serious injury (ligament rupture) and the coach's decision not to count on Chilean Paulo Díaz. Currently, River only has Lucas Martínez Quarta and the young Lautaro Rivero as undisputed players in that sector.\n\nRomaña, 27, perfectly fits the profile the \"Muñeco\" is looking for: a defender with physical strength, a good current performance in local football, and room for growth.\n\nThe success of the operation now depends on Sebastián Boselli's willingness. The Uruguayan defender is the key bargaining chip for San Lorenzo to accept the transfer. If the player gives the green light to join Damián Ayude's team, Romaña will become the third reinforcement for a River aiming high for 2026.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "description": null,
    "fullText": "Forecast error leads to misallocation of inventory across demand channels,\r\ndriving lost sales. For example, for a product with units of demand\r\nsplit across two channels, we find that relying on a single prior sales cycle\r\nto guide allocation leads to a loss of roughly of potential sales.\n\nIn general, we find that misallocation losses scale as\n\nIn practice, this means misallocation matters most for lower-volume products\r\nand for assortments spread across many locations.\n\nCombining our worked example with this scaling law provides a quick way to\r\nestimate misallocation losses for general products. While these losses can be\r\nmeaningful, they fall sharply with improved forecasting, for example via data\r\npooling across related products.\n\nThe mathematics of allocation applies whenever a fixed supply must be divided\r\nacross independent demand channels. Two common applications include the\r\ndistribution of units across retail locations and the setting of size breaks\r\nfor a garment.\n\nThe goal in allocation is to avoid scenarios where some channels are\r\nsystematically over-resourced – and so unlikely to sell through their units,\r\nwhile others are systematically under-resourced – and so likely to stock out\r\nearly, resulting in missed sales. In a situation like this, shifting units\r\naround to improve balance will lift expected net sales. In fact, we showed in\r\na prior post that to\r\nmaximize net unit sales, we must allocate units so that each channel has the\r\nsame probability of stocking out.\n\nTo implement this optimal strategy, we must first be able to accurately\r\nforecast the demand distribution of each channel (i.e., how likely it is that\r\ndemand will come in at each possible value for that channel). If our forecasts\r\nare inaccurate, supply will again be imbalanced. In the appendix to this post,\r\nwe work out the following approximation for the misallocation loss that then\r\nresults,\n\nEquation (1) the main result of our post. This provides accurate numerical\r\nestimates for losses that are not too large, and it also generally provides\r\nuseful intuition for understanding how misallocation losses scale. E.g., from\r\nthis we can see how the fractional loss increases as we cut demand across an\r\nincreasing number of channels.\n\nIn the next section, we apply the result (1) to a concrete example. The\r\nfollowing summary section then reviews some qualitative takeaways and also\r\nillustrates how to use the scaling rule and our one worked example to estimate\r\ngeneral losses.\n\nTo get a feel for (1), suppose we have a product with a total demand of\r\n units split across retail locations.\r\nAssume true demand is split 50-50 across the two locations, but we only have\r\none prior noisy measurement of demand at each (this implies – see\r\nthe appendix for details).\n\nSuppose we purchase units for a second cycle and plan to allocate them\r\nacross locations in proportion to the prior noisy measurements. If the first\r\ncycle comes in unusually strong at Location 1, we will overestimate demand\r\nthere and send more than 50% of units in the next cycle. This will result in\r\nan imbalance, decreasing expected net sales. Indeed, in Figure 1, the blue\r\ncurve shows the numerically evaluated net expected sales as a function of the\r\nnumber of units sent to the first location. There we see that expected sales\r\nare maximized at the balanced 50–50 split, where we achieve about 94 units of\r\nexpected sell-through. We do not reach units because demand may come in\r\nsoft at either location, leading to partial sell-through. Moving away from the\r\nbalanced allocation reduces expected sales further.\n\nNext, consider averaging over all possible outcomes from the first sales cycle.\r\nThis will give us a sense of the typical loss that results from forecast error.\r\nTo evaluate the average loss due to this sort of demand measurement error, we\r\ncould average the values on the numerical blue curve, averaging over the demand\r\nmeasurement error distribution. However, it turns out we can also approximate\r\nthe blue curve using a convenient analytic expression – the black dashed curve\r\nbelow. If we use this “quadratic” approximation and carry out the average, the\r\nresult is (1) – again, see appendix for derivation. Plugging the values for\r\nour example into (1) gives us the estimated expected loss from misallocation:\n\nThat is, misallocation driven by measurement error reduces expected sales by\r\nabout . In absolute terms, we expect to sell around units on average\r\nrather than .\n\nFigure 1: Expected sales for a product with units of demand\r\nsplit evenly across two channels, shown as a function of the allocation .\r\nThe blue curve gives the exact evaluation, and the dashed curve shows the\r\nquadratic approximation used in (1). Even with truly balanced demand, limited\r\nhistorical data can lead us to over-allocate to one channel – for example,\r\nsending more than units to Location 1 if it happened to run hot last time\r\n– reducing expected net sales.\n\nOur central result (1) shows that misallocation losses follow a simple scaling\r\nrule. Combined with the worked example above, this gives a simple way to\r\nestimate losses for general products. In particular, whenever forecasts are\r\nbased on a single past sale period's data for the product, we have\n\nFor example, if we increase by (i.e., go from\r\n to ), the fractional loss will , going from\r\n to . Similarly, if we can double the amount data informing our\r\nforecasts, our value and expected net loss will both be cut in half.\n\nFormula (1) applies when our total unit investment is close to the expected\r\ntotal demand. The more general expression (8) in the appendix shows that\r\nmisallocation losses diminish outside this regime. If we greatly overbuy, no\r\nchannel is likely to stock out; if we greatly underbuy, all channels will. In\r\neither case, reallocation details have little effect. This suggests a practical\r\nplanning hierarchy: get total demand right first, and focus on allocation\r\naccuracy only once net supply and demand are reasonably aligned.\n\nA second lever is forecast quality. If we double the amount of data informing\r\nour forecasts (for example, by pooling data across similar products), our\r\nforecast error parameter — and the resulting misallocation loss — will\r\nfall by half. Improving forecasts in this way can meaningfully reduce avoidable\r\nlosses, often without increasing operational burden or requiring additional\r\nunit investment.\n\nIn our first post on allocation, we derived the following\n\nThis says that the lift in expected sales for a given channel on adding one\r\nmore unit there is equal to the sell through probability.\n\nIf we differentiate (4), we get\n\nHere, is the pdf of the demand distribution of channel .\n\nNow consider what happens when we attempt to optimize units across channels.\r\nAt the optimal point , all values of (4) are equal. Suppose we move\r\naway from that and set\n\nAssuming we are not far from the optimal solution, the change in sales at\r\nchannel will be\n\nSumming over all channels, we get\n\nHere, we’ve used the fact that the first partials are all equal at the optimal\r\npoint, and that the sum to zero. We’ve also used (5) for the\r\nsecond partial.\n\nEquation (8) is a useful result that generalizes (1) above. It gives us an\r\nexpression for the expected sales loss as we move away from the optimal\r\nsolution for general (accurate, provided these are not too large – e.g.,\r\nwe used this formula to get the black dashed curve in Figure 1). Notice that\r\nthis equation implies that the costs of misallocation are largest when the\r\n are maximized. This will occur when net supply is close to the\r\nnet expected demand. As we move away from that limit, allocation concerns are\r\nless important. See the Discussion section for additional commentary.\n\nTo gain more intuition for typical scenarios, we now posit a Poisson-Normal\r\ndistribution for the demand at a given site. With this, we have\n\nIf we plug into the normal distribution, we get\n\nNow suppose that we are trying to send the expected demand to each site.\r\nSuppose no bias but that prior demand estimates follow from samples taken from\r\nthe distribution (10). In this case, our estimate for will be noisy, and\r\nthe expected of the next send will have value\n\nwith a common value across channels. Notice that if we have only one\r\nprior sample, then will be one here – a value we quote in the body of\r\nthe post.\n\nWith these assumptions, the average cost in (7) will then go like\n\nThis again is a slight generalization of (1), one where we do not assume each\r\nchannel is equal in size. To get to (1), we posit equal in\r\nsize. Plugging this into (12) and dividing by the total demand, we get\n\nwhich is equivalent to (1). We take these particular assumptions in order to\r\nhighlight the fractional loss’s dependence on the number of channels.\n\nVarietyIQ helps retailers and brands optimize inventory decisions — from\r\nforecasting and allocation to pricing and product mix.

    "description": "Critics are judging models trained on last-gen hardware. There's a 6x wave of compute already allocated - and it's just starting to produce results.",
    "fullText": "You've heard the new narrative: AI scaling hit a wall, the capex is insane, the returns aren't there. But the critics are judging models trained on last-gen hardware. There's a 6x wave of compute already allocated - and it's just starting to produce results.\n\nThis post looks at how much compute is actually coming online - and the early signs of what it is achieving.\n\nMorgan Stanley did some excellent research looking at CoWoS (Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate) allocations for TSMC. CoWoS is TSMC's advanced 2.5D chip packaging technology and is used for nearly all leading silicon in artificial intelligence:\n\nFirstly, we can see that total supply is estimated to go from 117,000 wafers to 1 million wafers, in just 4 years, with NVIDIA taking the lion's share of the supply. Interestingly though, Broadcom (which produces Google's TPUs) is taking 15% of that capacity, with AMD growing 15x for their MI300/MI400 series of AI chips.\n\nThis doesn't tell us the total story though - as chips are continually improving in FLOPs/mm² of wafer.\n\nI did some napkin math[1] to try and convert this into exaFLOPs. This is a lot of guesswork on shipment mix, but I believe it should be roughly in the right ballpark:\n\nNote the Google TPU stats assume a very aggressive ramp from Broadcom, which is somewhat in question. Again, this is napkin math.\n\nAI silicon flow is increasing dramatically - and really starts gathering steam into 2026.\n\nIf we look at cumulative installs, we start seeing a huge amount of exaFLOPs available across the globe - with a roughly 6x increase in global AI chip capacity between 2024 and 2026e.\n\nIt's difficult to undersell the implications of this growth. Between ChatGPT first launching and the end of 2026, the world will have nearly 50x more compute installed and available for us. To push an overused analogy arguably too far, the initial build of railways in the UK and US were closer to 10x over 10 years. This level of infrastructure buildout hasn't really been seen before in human history - probably WW2 military spend is the only thing that surpasses it as a proportion of GDP in the Western world.\n\nHaving said all that, there is a significant lag between a chip being finished with TSMC and it coming online - probably at least a month in absolutely ideal conditions. However, there have been significant delays with getting the latest GB200 series of AI accelerators as they require liquid cooling - which previous generations didn't. There have been a lot of rumours that this has been extremely difficult to get right, with widespread reports of overheating and leaks from the liquid cooling system delaying the rollout of this generation of AI accelerators from Nvidia.\n\nThis doesn't even get into the serious power capacity constraints the datacentre industry is currently battling - a million wafers worth of Blackwell-class silicon implies a need for gigawatts of new power capacity. This physical bottleneck is likely to be the true governor on how fast that '2026e' column actually comes online.\n\nOn top of this - the even larger delay is from when a chip gets installed and powered on in a datacentre facility to training finishing. It's likely this process takes at least 6 months end to end - assuming no major problems or difficulties.\n\nSo when we look at 'current' models - we are looking really in the past, probably 12 months or so all things being equal. When I wrote this blog at the end of 2025 we're really just seeing the results of 2024's cumulative infrastructure buildout.\n\nIt's very important to point out though that not all of this compute is being allocated towards training. Proportionally more and more will be allocated to inference to serve current customers. However, at off peak times I'm sure that the big AI players are dedicating a lot of this spare inference compute allocation to new techniques like agentic reinforcement learning - which can be easily checkpointed and done \"off peak\".\n\nAnd let's not forget that an enormous amount of compute still is going to be allocated to training. Sam Altman has said in a recent interview that OpenAI would be profitable if it wasn't for training - no doubt the cost of researchers plays a big part, but compute has to be a huge part of the expenditure there.\n\nTwo models have really caught my eye recently - Opus 4.5 and Gemini 3. I wrote an article a few weeks ago delving into them if you're interested to learn more, but the quick summary is that Opus 4.5 is a step change in terms of software engineering and Gemini 3 has graphic/UI design skills far ahead of other models.\n\nA month or so later, I really agree with what I wrote there - while the benchmark scores were impressive, they massively undersell what a giant leap Opus 4.5 has been. Combined with Claude Code I've found that it really can do 30 minutes+ of software engineering with minimal (or no) babysitting. This is a step change from Anthropic's previous Sonnet 4.5 model - which required me to constantly interrupt its execution to correct its approach.\n\nI've noticed two other more quantitatively sound approaches also backing up what I'm anecdotally seeing. Firstly, one of Princeton's HAL agent benchmarks has been \"solved\" by the combination of Opus 4.5 and Claude Code:\n\nOpus 4.5 + Claude Code effectively solving the benchmark, a massive jump from the previous SOTA.\n\nSecondly, METR has been doing some fascinating work on seeing how long various models can operate on successfully. We're starting to see an enormous leap forward on this - with Opus 4.5 managing to complete software engineering tasks that would take a human 4+ hours successfully in over 50% of cases.\n\nNote the 50%+ success rate on tasks that take humans 4+ hours.\n\nNow, correlation doesn't equal causation, but it's hard to not notice the parallels between the performance here and the availability of compute.\n\nBut if you look closely at the timelines, you realise that this performance isn't the result of the massive wave of compute I just described. It's actually the result of the trickle that came before it.\n\nLook at the \"Cumulative Installs\" for 2024 versus 2026 in my table above.\n\nBecause of the installation and training lag I described earlier, Opus 4.5 and Gemini 3 were likely trained on the 2024 install base. They are the product of roughly ~36 exaFLOPs of global capacity.\n\nWe are looking at these PhD-level engineering capabilities and assuming they are the result of the current AI hype cycle. They aren't. They are the result of the infrastructure that was ordered before the mania truly set in.\n\nThe 100+ exaFLOPs coming online in 2025 and the 220+ in 2026? That compute hasn't even finished a training run yet.\n\nIf Opus 4.5 is what we get from the 'trickle' of 2024 compute, what happens when the 'flood' of 2026 infrastructure actually finishes training the next generation? By 2030, if trends continue, we'll have nearly 30x more - a zettaFLOP (1021 FLOPs). The scaling debate is about to get a lot more uncomfortable.",

    "description": "A concise set of reccomendations.",
    "fullText": "This is a guide on how individual contributors (ICs) can achieve outsized impact within a software organization.\n\nIndividual contributors have the special property that they can get real work done. Managers are often constrained because their leverage is through people, which often means slower and steadier change.\n\nICs can bypass this. You can work a weekend to deliver a working prototype. You can spend nights finding an insane performance optimization. You can Proof-of-Concept a feature scheduled for next year.\n\nSo much of a company is bound by risk assessment, expected timing, and prioritization minutiae. Finding a genuine breakthrough cuts through the bureaucracy and fundamentally shifts the timeline.\n\nIf this work is so important, why isn’t it prioritized? It’s not prioritized because if you make it part of the day-to-day, it gets bogged down and dragged out like everything else, often resulting in sunk time with nothing to show for it.\n\nOccasionally, ICs should go all-in, work intensely, and find a breakthrough.\n\nIf you want to be a leader, you have to act like one.\n\nThat begins with being optimistic, not starting or encouraging big commiseration sessions with more junior people, not trying to set up an us-vs-them dynamic against “management” or treat other company structures like the bad guy.\n\nMany senior ICs think it’s their job to be the union rep for ICs. The only thing that actually accomplishes is undermining your own credibility. It doesn’t deliver the value that would make people’s bonuses go up, and it doesn’t change hearts and minds.\n\nBut you also shouldn’t be a shill for management.\n\nLike it or not, your job is to be an unaffiliated, unbiased leader, and doing what’s right in individual situations.\n\nAnother critical part of being an IC leader is owning things.\n\nOne of the specific virtues of the manager position is that it provides radical clarity on ownership - you own the team. With that ownership comes risk, reward, and accountability. The team wins, you win. The team fails, you fail.\n\nToo often ICs get slotted into being 1 of n engineers on a team, becoming a non-unique, non-owner of outcomes. In fact, agile development processes often specifically encourage interchangeable resourcing.\n\nBut ICs should avoid taking this too far. Ownership and accountability are critical forcing functions for growth. You should ask yourself - what specifically could fail that would cause me to get less rewards? What specifically could do well that I should uniquely get credit for?\n\nIf you don’t have a good answer, you don’t have enough specific, named ownership. While ownership can come in many forms (services, features..etc), the core unit of ownership is a goal. If you don’t uniquely own any specific goal, you are shortchanging yourself.\n\nBi-weekly is usually a good cadence.\n\nSend your boss a doc that says what you’re doing, what you need help with, and cc their boss.\n\nThe benefits of this ritual are truly massive.\n\nYou’ll be shocked at how much better you get at self-management when forced to do it.\n\nYou’ll be shocked at how often your boss/boss’s boss can solve your problems faster when presented this way, and how grateful they will be for the clear updates.\n\nPS if you use AI to write these updates you’ve destroyed their purpose entirely and are subtracting value.\n\nTalk to people more senior than you in the org chart.\n\nSeriously - book time with senior people, or ask them for 30 minutes to discuss what they think is valuable and worth doing. Senior leaders absolutely love this, because it lets them get more important work done through their team, and it often doubles as a therapy session.\n\nTalk to five people from different parts of the business.\n\nThen go solve one of those problems.\n\nThis is an extremely underrated activity because:",

    "description": "The ride-hailing giant’s background check process was intended to speed drivers onto its network while keeping costs down, internal documents show.",
    "fullText": "You can send the reporter tips at nytimes.com/tips.\n\nUber says its background checks are essential for keeping passengers safe, promising that all of its drivers have passed a screening for violent crimes.\n\nThe claim, made in marketing materials, ignores a critical detail: The system approves people with many types of criminal convictions, including violent felonies. That is because Uber has limited the criteria used to vet potential drivers, part of a push to speed them onto the ride-hailing network while keeping costs down, a New York Times investigation found.\n\nUber rejects prospective drivers who have been convicted of murder, sexual assault, kidnapping and terrorism. But in 22 states, The Times found, the company approves people convicted of most other crimes — including child abuse, assault and stalking — so long as the convictions are at least seven years old.\n\nThere are also gaps in Uber’s screenings. Background checks in 35 states are based on where a person has lived in the past seven years. The result is that a crime that happened elsewhere could go unnoticed.\n\nOver time, company executives considered and ultimately chose not to expand the types of offenses that would disqualify someone, according to internal documents reviewed by The Times.\n\nThey also debated how thoroughly to look back for convictions. “We are def not doing everything we can,” Brooke Anderson, then Uber’s head of safety communications, said in a 2018 email exchange about background checks.\n\nFYI The sensitivities are b/c we are def not doing everything we can to find out (more of a bare minimum that we look at the records we get and if we see anything, we'll act)\n\nOne brainstorming document listed nearly two dozen safety measures the company could adopt. In-person interviews were deemed logistically challenging, the document shows. Fingerprint checks were considered costly and time intensive.\n\nWomen who reported being sexually assaulted during Uber rides said that the company’s vetting practices put them in harm’s way, accusations reflected in lawsuits and other court records reviewed by The Times.\n\nIn 2020, an Uber driver in San Diego was accused of using his fingers to forcibly penetrate a passenger’s vagina, then choking her and throwing her phone out the window when she tried to fight back. The driver’s record included felony convictions for assault with a deadly weapon in 2002 and 2006. Earlier in 2020, he had been arrested after an allegation of rape but not yet charged. Arrests alone are not disqualifying in Uber’s background checks.\n\nThe next year, an Uber driver in Tampa, Fla., was accused of raping a passenger who had been out celebrating her 21st birthday. The driver had eight felony convictions, including for robbery with a firearm in 2002, as well as more than a dozen driving violations.\n\nAnd in the years since, drivers with convictions for assault, child abuse, armed robbery and other crimes have been accused of sexually assaulting passengers across the country, The Times found.\n\nThe incidents are part of a scourge of sexual violence during Uber rides. The ride-hailing giant received a report of sexual assault or sexual misconduct in the United States almost every eight minutes on average from 2017 to 2024, according to internal data revealed in litigation, far more than what the company has publicly disclosed.\n\nIt is unclear how many people with violent criminal histories have been cleared to drive for Uber, let alone how many of those drivers have sexually assaulted passengers. In one of the most comprehensive audits to date, officials in Massachusetts conducted background checks of ride-hailing drivers in the state in 2017, as new regulations were set to take effect that introduced stricter guidelines for screenings. Officials banned more than 8,000 drivers, or roughly 11 percent, who had previously been approved.\n\nInside the company, executives have long been aware of the pervasiveness of sexual violence during rides and the risk factors linked to attacks — yet they have repeatedly given priority to expanding their business over introducing stronger protections for drivers and passengers, a Times investigation in August found.\n\nAs Uber grew into a $165 billion global behemoth, it successfully lobbied against laws proposed in many states that would have required stricter screenings. A key element of that campaign was positioning itself with criminal justice reform groups, previously unreported internal documents show.\n\nIn a statement, Hannah Nilles, Uber’s head of safety for the Americas, said that the company believes a seven-year cutoff for felony convictions “strikes the right balance between protecting public safety and giving people with older criminal records a chance to work and rebuild their lives.”\n\nShe said that the time period is grounded in academic research that has found that seven years after an arrest, the likelihood that a person will commit another offense is as a low as a person who never committed a crime. “A lifetime exclusion for every criminal offense would unfairly prevent people from finding jobs long after they’ve served their time,” she said.\n\nBecause sexual violence is a significantly underreported crime, public safety experts, lawmakers and others said that ride-hailing companies should do more to scrutinize and train drivers, who are often alone in cars with strangers. That could include in-person interviews and reference checks, as well as more education about sexual assault, consent and a driver’s duty to transport people safely, they said.\n\n“They should hold their drivers to a high standard, knowing they are putting them in situations with vulnerable people who trust them and trust that Uber has checked them,” said Erin Murphy, a prosecutor in Boston who handles sexual assault cases involving ride-hailing drivers.\n\nThe safety experts pointed to other jobs where people with violent felony convictions are often prohibited, such as employment in day care centers, schools and elder care facilities. Research shows that perpetrators of rape often have criminal histories, with a Justice Department study finding that more than a third of people arrested on rape charges had at least one prior felony conviction.\n\nMs. Nilles disputed the idea that driving for Uber is similar to working in a day care or elder-care facility. Fingerprint checks are “inaccurate, ineffective and discriminatory,” she added, and in-person interviews “likely would cause meaningful bias.”\n\nLyft, Uber’s smaller rival, follows different guidelines. The company bans drivers with convictions for violent felonies, regardless of when they occurred. “They result in lifetime bans from our platform,” Ameena Gill, Lyft’s vice president of safety and customer care, said in a statement.\n\nStill, drivers with criminal records have slipped through Lyft’s screenings. In March 2019, a woman in Fresno, Calif., said her Lyft driver raped her after she requested a ride from a bar. Court records show the driver had multiple felony convictions from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s, including for firing a shotgun at a vehicle while two people were inside. The woman sued the company, and the case was recently settled.\n\nMs. Gill declined to comment about whether there were mistakes with the driver’s screening. “If Lyft becomes aware of a driver on the platform with such a conviction, that driver is immediately deactivated,” she said.\n\nUber and Lyft are now facing thousands of sexual assault lawsuits from passengers across the country. The companies maintain that rides are overwhelmingly safe and that the vast majority — at least 99.9 percent of more than a billion rides in the United States a year — happen without incident. Uber said that 75 percent of the reports it had received about sexual assault and sexual misconduct were for “less serious” matters, such as flirting or making comments about someone’s appearance.\n\n“Safety is not a static goal,” said Ms. Gill of Lyft. “We’re committed to continuously strengthening our systems and working with safety experts, advocates and regulators to set the highest standards for our industry.”\n\nMs. Nilles, Uber’s safety executive, said the company’s background checks were “thorough, accurate, fair, and meet or exceed both the law and the practices of peer companies.” She said that the company has invested in rerunning background checks for drivers each year and creating technologies to continuously monitor and flag new criminal offenses.\n\n“We are confident when we say Uber is one of the safest ways to get around,” Ms. Nilles added.\n\nThe woman in San Diego who accused her driver of attacking her in 2020 said she had epilepsy and relied on Uber to get around because she saw promotions from the company that said safety was a top priority.\n\nIn her case, the screening process did not flag a conviction that, according to California regulations, would normally disqualify a driver.\n\nThe driver had previously been convicted of felonies in 2002 and 2006 for assault with a deadly weapon, with the 2002 incident classified as a violent offense for inflicting great bodily injury, according to court records. In California, people with violent felonies are permanently disqualified from driving for ride-hailing companies.\n\nMs. Nilles said the felony assault convictions had been reported to Uber by Checkr, the background check company that it uses to conduct screenings. But, she said, the classification as a violent offense had not. “Uber’s role is to correctly adjudicate the report we receive, which we did in this case,” Ms. Nilles said. Checkr declined to comment on the specifics of this screening, citing privacy laws.\n\nUber blocked the driver’s account in October 2020 after receiving a report about the incident. He was later charged with forcible sexual penetration and robbery. He is now in prison for convictions related to this and another incident.\n\n“I am naïve for putting my trust in a corporation,” the woman said. “Can you blame me for listening to what they want me to believe?”\n\nWhen someone applies to drive for Uber, Checkr cross reference their name, date of birth, Social Security number and other details against public court documents, motor vehicle records, national criminal databases and other sources.\n\nUber customized the rules that Checkr uses to review and report criminal records, including how far back to check for offenses, according to Uber’s agreement with Checkr.\n\nWhile specific guidelines vary according to state and local laws, Uber generally allows convictions after seven years for any felony, including violent crimes. People can be blocked for pending charges.\n\nIn a statement, Checkr said that laws require the company to “follow rigorous standards for accuracy and restrict the type of information that can appear on a background check.”\n\nReports fall into two categories: “clear” or “consider.” A team at Uber reviews reports in the “consider” category, Ms. Nilles said. She added that a background check, on average, takes three days. But if a screening is clear, court records show, the entire process can finish in a matter of hours, without an Uber employee ever meeting an applicant.\n\nIn 2022, Uber approved a driver in Florida who was on parole after a decade in prison for two violent felonies. About one month after the driver began with Uber, court records show, a passenger accused him of sexual misconduct. Less than a week later, another reported him to the police for rape. The driver denied the accusation, saying the sex was consensual.\n\nIn March 2024, a woman said her Uber driver forcibly groped and digitally penetrated her in a parking lot in the Atlanta area. The driver’s record included a conviction for child abuse, with an eight-year prison sentence, after three teenagers had accused him of sexual assault, court records show.\n\nIn December 2024, a driver picked up Katilyn Woodworth, then a 29-year-old mother of two in Oregon who had been out drinking. Instead of taking her home, she told the police that he raped her. Uber had cleared the driver despite a 2012 conviction for felony assault.\n\nAt a criminal trial in late October, the driver pleaded not guilty to kidnapping, rape and sodomy charges, saying that the sex was consensual. In a ruling after a bench trial, the judge acquitted the driver, saying that prosecutors had failed to prove that Ms. Woodworth was legally incapacitated at the time of the incident or that the driver knew she was incapable of consent.\n\nMs. Nilles said all three drivers were screened correctly and in accordance with state laws.\n\nMs. Woodworth has sued Uber for negligence. The company said in court filings that it was not responsible for the incident.\n\n“You had all of the red flags,” she said. “You had all of the information you needed to protect me.”\n\nShe said that the incident has left her suffering from night terrors and insomnia, leading her to stop working and abandon creative pursuits like painting. She said she holds in panic attacks when her sons, who know that “mommy got hurt,” give her a hug. She now sits alone in silence after she puts them to bed.\n\nThe debate over who should be allowed to drive for Uber dates back to the company’s early days.\n\nIn 2015, Uber executives outlined a strategy to “shift the conversation about safety from background checks to [less costly] initiatives,” according to an internal document.\n\nTactics: By using our internal data and engaging with third-party groups, shift the conversation about safety from background checks to [less costly] initiatives proven to reduce incidents.\n\nPoll riders to understand how palatable our arguments are\n\nif we can change their perception of a BGC to focus on technology and incident rate reduction;\n\nif we can make soft arguments about discrimination palatable to them; and\n\nto what degree they will be willing to ride in a car with someone who’s formerly incarcerated or has a misdemeanor on their record (assuming that violent offenses are off the table).\n\nSample message: No BGC is perfect, but we’re doing our best to keep people out of the driver’s seat who shouldn’t be there. We're also doing what we can to ensure we don’t prevent those who should have an opportunity from getting one.\n\nAn essential part of the strategy was pushing for criminal justice reform, an issue that was gaining momentum among politicians across the country. The document discussed plans to poll passengers to understand how “palatable” the company’s arguments were, including “to what degree they will be willing to ride in a car with someone who’s formerly incarcerated or has a misdemeanor on their record.”\n\nThe plan included striking partnerships with groups that worked with formerly incarcerated people and recruiting allies to promote the “discriminatory nature” of fingerprinting, drug testing and other similar requirements. One of those allies was Eric Holder, the former U.S. attorney general who had been hired by Uber to advise on safety issues.\n\nOver time, many states passed laws that created a patchwork of rules governing ride-hailing companies. New York City is now the only place in the country that requires fingerprinting for potential Uber and Lyft drivers.\n\nAs the company worked to reframe the background check conversation, people inside Uber raised concerns about the limits of its screenings.\n\nIn 2018, Jill Hazelbaker, Uber’s chief marketing officer, and Ms. Anderson, then head of safety communications, discussed in an email exchange concerns about how background checks were based, in part, on the past seven years of people’s residence history.\n\nThat means that if a person committed a crime in a different county from where they had lived — even a permanently disqualifying offense like murder — the screenings might not catch the conviction.\n\n“The fact this is an internal policy that we don’t feel comfortable talking about externally highlights the need for improvement here,” Ms. Anderson said.\n\nThe two executives pushed to upgrade Uber’s package with Checkr so that background checks would review a person’s entire residence history.\n\nThe proposed changes were estimated to cost an additional $16.8 million to review active drivers, plus $15.2 million each year for new applicants, according to the email exchange.\n\nAnother executive cautioned that the proposal could increase the amount of time it would take to complete a check.\n\nMs. Hazelbaker argued that it was “indefensible” not to use the more thorough checks. “The reputation costs associated with not doing it far exceeds the dollar amount,” she wrote.\n\nUber did not adopt the upgrade.\n\nNow, Uber pays Checkr for two different levels of screenings, according to its agreement with Checkr. Service A, at $7.15 per check, reviews seven years of a person’s residence history, then searches criminal records based on those places. Service B, at $13.80, reviews a person’s entire residence history for criminal records.\n\nUber uses the more expensive option where required by local laws — in 15 states, seven cities and Washington D.C. Elsewhere, Uber uses the cheaper seven-year check.\n\nCheckr said in a statement that its “criminal record searches include multiple databases and courthouses, and can extend beyond seven years of residence history, depending on the scope ordered.”\n\nIn a statement, Ms. Anderson, who is still a communications executive at Uber, said that the email thread was “not representative of the comprehensive, intentional approach Uber takes toward safety and background checks.”\n\nShe said that the company had given priority to other initiatives, including the rerunning of background checks for existing drivers and building a program with Lyft to share information between companies about drivers banned for sexual assault and other safety incidents.\n\nIn September 2021, Anthony Oliveras-Rivera was cleared to drive for Uber after Checkr reviewed his criminal and driving records, according to a copy of his background check.\n\nHe accepted a ride request in Tampa at about 10 p.m. one Thursday night that December.\n\nThe passenger was a 20-year-old woman, identified in court documents as Jane Doe. Earlier, she had met up with friends to celebrate her upcoming birthday. She drank more alcohol than she ever had in her life, she said in a deposition, and started blacking out. She was eventually separated from her friends outside a nightclub.\n\nA young woman spotted Ms. Doe and ordered her a ride.\n\nMr. Oliveras-Rivera drove Ms. Doe to her home 24 miles outside Tampa and marked the ride complete at 10:59 p.m., according to a trip receipt. She did not have her keys, however, and he eventually drove her back to the hotel where she had met her friends that evening.\n\nAt the hotel, he told a security guard that he needed help with a girl who had passed out in his back seat. Her underwear was down, the guard later told police officers, and she had urinated on herself.\n\nThe next day, Ms. Doe went to work but felt like something had gone horribly wrong. She went to the emergency room and later underwent a sexual assault forensic exam. The DNA was a match to Mr. Oliveras-Rivera, according to to police reports. He admitted that he had sex with Ms. Doe.\n\nMr. Oliveras-Rivera, who continued driving for Uber through the next month, eventually pleaded guilty to three counts of sexual battery and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nThe public defender’s office that represented Mr. Oliveras-Rivera referred requests for comment to the Florida Department of Corrections, which did not respond.\n\nMs. Doe is now suing Uber, claiming that she was sexually assaulted because of the company’s negligence in hiring and supervising Mr. Oliveras-Rivera.\n\n“I felt like he took my soul away,” Ms. Doe said in a deposition.\n\nMs. Nilles said that Mr. Oliveras-Rivera passed a background check in accordance with Florida law.\n\nThe screenings of Mr. Oliveras-Rivera, however, did not catch eight felony convictions from 1999 and 2002, including one for invading a home armed with a machine gun. He had prison sentences totaling 18 years, according to court records. He had more than a dozen driving violations, including multiple license suspensions and an arrest in North Carolina for driving under the influence nine years before he began with Uber.\n\nHe had also been investigated over allegations that he physically and sexually abused a 5-year-old girl one year before the incident. He denied any abuse, and the complaint was deemed unfounded after the girl declined to speak to investigators, according to police reports.\n\nMr. Oliveras-Rivera’s criminal record would probably have banned him from driving a taxi in Tampa, according to local regulations that prohibit drivers with a record of any violent felony.\n\nOver the years, Uber had lobbied for a separate, statewide standard for ride-hailing drivers with a less prohibitive disqualification period — banning drivers if, among other considerations, they were convicted of a felony in the last five years or are listed on the National Sex Offender registry.\n\n“There was no way for Uber to know that Oliveras-Rivera had a propensity to commit sexual assault prior to the subject incident,” Uber said in court filings.\n\nDuring a hearing in October, the judge presiding over the lawsuit agreed with the company, saying that the driver’s record did not include anything that “would have resulted in his disqualification under the Florida statute when he applied.”\n\nSince the incident, Ms. Doe said in depositions that she has felt “dead inside.” She has missed work, withdrawn socially, experienced trouble sleeping and received treatment for anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress.\n\n“I’m trying my hardest just to survive this,” she said.\n\nKirsten Noyes contributed research.",

    "description": "Providence police Maj. David Lapatin explains how investigators grappled with four different leads before a fifth finally led to Claudio Neves Valente.",
    "fullText": "Some of the first Providence police major crimes detectives to set eyes on the scene of the Brown University shooting arrived as tactical police officers escorted survivors from the building on Dec. 13.\n\nThe detectives arrived intermittently in the early minutes of an investigation that would test their skills and consume nearly all of their time over the course of five days.\n\nAt times, some would go without sleep for more than 30 hours, according to the person in charge, Providence police Maj. David Lapatin.\n\nInvestigators from a collection of agencies would grapple with four different leads, some more promising than others, before a fifth lead put them on the path of Claudio Neves Valente, the man who authorities say carried out the shootings at Brown, killed a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor and then took his own life in a storage facility in Salem, New Hampshire.\n\nThe fifth lead, based in large part on aid from a Brown alumnus and Reddit poster and subsequent investigative accomplishments, was a long way off as the team assembled just after the shooting.\n\nThe leaders of the teams on the scene in those early minutes, including Lapatin, saw the victims, Ella Cook and MukhammadAziz Umurzokov, in the auditorium-style classroom. They saw dozens of spent cartridge shells. Backpacks and other paraphernalia were strewn around. Bullets had penetrated some of the seats.\n\nLapatin spoke to a small group of detective supervisors.\n\n\"I just told them, 'Look, we've got to take the chaos out of our heads and just concentrate,'\" he says.\n\n\"They all stepped to it,\" he recalls. \"They're all professionals.\"\n\nInvestigators from the crime scene processing team, the Bureau of Criminal Identification, were on the job. Agents from the many federal agencies were already on their way to join in the manhunt. State police handled emergency calls and some routine calls.\n\nManaging the surviving students safely and appropriately for investigative purposes was one of the tasks at hand. They were removed from the building.\n\n\"We wanted to keep as many as we can in a safe place so we could question them later,\" Lapatin says.\n\nAs the survivors waited to talk to detectives, investigators wanted the group at least separated from other people prior to the interviews. The preference, to separate such witnesses from each other, wasn't possible based on conditions.\n\n\"We didn't have much choice,\" Lapatin said.\n\n\"There was a lot of them, a lot in the beginning,\" he added, saying that there were also a lot of police officers with them as well.\n\nWere investigators worried the killer might be in the group?\n\n\"That was always a thought, but we really didn't think so, because, you know, we had some people saying the suspect went out the door,\" Lapatin says.\n\nOther investigators were already in a room at Brown University where screens showed video from campus surveillance cameras. A clip recorded by a camera drew attention, Lapatin says.\n\n\"And what stood out was this man,\" Lapatin recalls.\n\n\"This man, you know, in dark clothing with the face mask, which at the end turned out to be the suspect,\" he says.\n\nThe man was not holding a gun in the video that was drawing the most attention.\n\n\"It was after the shooting,\" Lapatin said.\n\n\"He was walking,\" he said. \"Everybody else was running.\"\n\nIn time, investigators would come to believe that the gun was hidden.\n\n\"Our belief was that he had the satchel now under his coat, with the gun inside,\" Lapatin says.\n\nLapatin and other detectives set up a command post in a building next door.\n\nCalls flowed in from other law enforcement agencies. Federal personnel from the FBI, ATF and Homeland Security Investigations joined the scene.\n\nProvidence police were \"leading\" the investigation, Lapatin says.\n\n\"That was without question,\" he says.\n\nA lead agency has to be established for organizational reasons, he says.\n\nIt was important to make sure there were no \"wildcat\" investigators and \"that everybody is on the same page.\"\n\nTwo major leads took shape during the first 12 hours of the investigation, Lapatin says.\n\nOne, based on a tip from an \"outside agency,\" involved a person who had applied for a gun permit, Lapatin says.\n\nThe information involved a person staying at the Hampton Inn in Coventry just off Interstate 95. He was detained as a person of interest before dawn early Sunday morning, Dec. 14.\n\nThe investigators saw \"some guns and other things,\" Lapatin says. They needed to look into it further.\n\n\"And that's what they did. They checked him out.\"\n\nThe news that someone had been detained was a relief for Rhode Islanders.\n\nBut not for investigators, according to Lapatin.\n\nAnd when the Coventry lead failed to pan out, investigators were not saddled with a big emotional letdown either, he says.\n\nThey had never let their hopes lift that high in the first place, Lapatin says, adding that their search for other leads had continued without pause.\n\n\"We never skipped a beat,\" he said.\n\nA second tip worthy of investigation had also emerged early Sunday morning, Lapatin says: Multiple people had referred police to a man who lived near the university.\n\nBrown had sent out an email asking anyone who was in the building to contact police. The same man called to tell police he had been in the building the day before the shooting.\n\n\"He had an alibi and he was cleared,\" says Lapatin.\n\n\"We decided we needed to take this back to our home grounds,\" Lapatin says.\n\nThe large suite of offices that houses Providence detectives, as well as the department's new Real Time Crime Center, is on one end of the floor.\n\nIn a separate section at the other end, investigators set up in a room where they could work on the tips that were flowing into the station on a designated phone line that was advertised to the public.\n\nThe Providence police team that processes crime scenes for evidence, led by Lt. Robert Papa, remained at Brown with their counterparts in the FBI.\n\nThe first daylight on Sunday helped.\n\nLapatin says they knew what they would do. They needed to methodically collect and view as much video as possible in the neighborhoods close to the scene and then work outward.\n\n\"It's one of our best chances of solving the case,\" Lapatin said.\n\nHowever, other investigators stayed at the safety complex.\n\n\"We had two rooms filled with people on computers,\" he said. \"That's all they did, sit on the computers all day. And then in the Real Time Crime Center, there was more people on computers. These people sat there for hours and hours and hours and just went through things without moving.\"\n\nMost of them were FBI analysts.\n\nLapatin says he had made contact with Wing Chau, the U.S. Marshal for Rhode Island. Chau added marshals to the massive force of investigators.\n\nAgents from the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and Homeland Security Investigations were already part of the team.\n\nAt Lapatin's request, Brown police Lt. John Carvalho, also the acting deputy chief of Brown's police department and a former Providence police sergeant, joined the team in place on the third floor.\n\nSome of the special technology from the FBI could help gather information from cellular communications. The bureau also had special tech tools for dealing with video and for quickly checking on criminal history, Lapatin says.\n\nThe ATF personnel contributed skills and capabilities for analyzing firearms and spent ammunition and shells. Some rounds that were not fired at the scene were found at the scene. They were checked for DNA. Some samples were obtained.\n\nThe evidence was driven to Connecticut's state crime lab in Meriden for analysis.\n\nThe Providence police remained the lead investigative agency, Lapatin says. Still, they prepared for the possibility of supporting a case for prosecution in federal court if necessary.\n\nRhode Island Attorney General Peter F. Neronha is a former U.S. Attorney, and two high-ranking prosecutors in his office – Deputy Attorney General Adi Goldstein and the chief of Neronha's criminal division, Stephen Dambruch – also had extensive experience as federal prosecutors.\n\nThey were in a group of prosecutors stationed in Lapatin's office.\n\nThe tip center had about 15 investigators working the phones and recording the tips. Workflow benefited from an FBI system that funneled the tips into a bin where everyone could see them, Lapatin says.\n\n\"And the other thing that's going,\" Lapatin says, \"that's full force now, is our Real Time Crime Center.\"\n\nThe crime center, which launched this past summer, has links to more than 300 live cameras, police say.\n\nIf investigators looking at those cameras can identify a suspect or person of interest to follow, the center is designed to help them track the person across multiple video feeds from one location to another.\n\nThe center is not staffed around the clock, Lapatin says.\n\n\"If something happens, we always have somebody who can jump right in there,\" he says, adding that somebody was probably in the center \"minutes\" after the shooting.\n\nOn Monday morning, Dec. 15, as the public reacted to news about the Coventry lead not panning out, investigators focused on a third tip.\n\nThree different calls, each of them regarding the same man, were received in the tip center, Lapatin says.\n\nThe man's size and physique lined up. One caller said they thought the man might have worked at Brown in the past.\n\nThe investigation surveilled the person.\n\n\"That involved watching him go through his daily routines,\" Lapatin says.\n\nInvestigators hoped to pick up something, perhaps some trash, that would provide a sample of DNA.\n\n\"We had a team on him, waiting for an opportunity to get some DNA,\" he says.\n\nThe work on that angle of the case would continue for days, even as the investigation ultimately focused heavily on Neves Valente.\n\nAs of late Monday night, investigators had gone through thousands of minutes of video.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, they established seven grids to search for video, Lapatin says. Prior to this, the search for cameras was organized by individual streets.\n\nThe search for video gained organization and efficiency by examining each house for potential cameras. Sometimes, street investigators obtained video. Other times, specialists went to extract the video. Lapatin estimates that each grid had 100 or 150 properties.\n\n\"It was time-consuming,\" he says. \"I know people were anxious. It was being worked.\"\n\nInvestigators hoped that a surveillance video would lead them to a better image of the masked suspect or even to a car associated with him.\n\n\"So lead three is hanging out there,\" Lapatin says. \"Lead one's gone. Lead two is gone.\"\n\nOn Tuesday a post on Reddit started to draw a lot of attention from investigators.\n\nThe post referred to a gray Nissan with Florida plates parked by the Rhode Island Historical Society. It also mentioned a man who'd acted strangely, locking and unlocking the car with a key fob.\n\n\"It looks pretty good,\" Lapatin says.\n\nInvestigators, based on video from the area, were already aware of movements by the masked man on Cooke Street prior to the shooting as well as some sort of contact he'd had with another person.\n\nBut their video did not show any car, Lapatin says.\n\nAnd they would learn that that other person was the Reddit poster.\n\nOn Tuesday and Wednesday, Dec. 16 and 17, long before they finally interviewed the Reddit poster on Wednesday night, investigators worked to track down a gray Nissan with a Florida plate.\n\nThe gray Nissan represented the fourth major lead in the case. Investigators focused on a woman who owned such a vehicle with a Florida plate. When the detectives looked into it, they found that the vehicle had been observed in the area.\n\nAlso, the woman had a close relative who may have fit the profile, Lapatin says.\n\nAfter a lot of surveillance, they felt the lead wasn't the strongest, Lapatin says. They talked to the woman at work and corroborated that she had told them the truth about where she had been during the time in question. That lead was ruled out.\n\n\"It was a fluke,\" Lapatin says.\n\nThe fifth and final lead, the one that would take police to the shooter, a Miami man, emerged as investigators continued to look for a Nissan of any color with a Florida plate.\n\nCapt. Dennis P. O'Brien said that more than 100 investigators had worked stints of more than 20 hours at a time, or longer, without sleep. O'Brien recalls working 31 hours on one shift. The teams didn't quit on the Nissan.\n\nProvidence police detectives, including Detective Joseph Nezier and Detective Mitch Guerra, and state police Detective Sgt. Robert Hopkins and several others, digested great amounts of video to try to see the Nissan in the area. They also ran searches within the system of networked license-plate reading cameras on the East Side.\n\nThe information provided by the system showed that a blue Nissan had been on North Main Street, at Randall Street near Whole Foods, on dates in early December and in the area on the day before the shooting, Lapatin says.\n\nThe blue Nissan was identified in the North Main Street, Doyle Street, Camp Street area, Lapatin says.\n\nSimultaneously, investigators were still working to make contact with the man who had authored the post on Reddit.\n\nTo get his IP address, investigators had to get a subpoena, Lapatin says, adding that the FBI handled that.\n\nOn Wednesday night, investigators interviewed the Reddit poster.\n\nThe man who wrote the Reddit post had graduated from Brown University in 2010, Lapatin says. Where he actually lived wasn't perfectly clear to investigators, Lapatin acknowledges. Detectives didn't push that issue.\n\n\"We needed to know more important information,\" he says.\n\nIt was clear that the man, who has a cell phone, had spent a lot of time on the streets, frequently used the bathroom in the engineering building and was familiar enough and protective enough to spot someone who didn't belong there, Lapatin says.\n\n\"So he comes in,\" Lapatin says, referring to the Reddit poster, \"and he's very well-spoken. And he explains exactly what happened.\"\n\nThe masked man had raised his suspicions during an encounter in the building.\n\nHis post on Reddit, about a gray Nissan, had channeled the investigation toward Neves Valente.\n\n\"That was it from there, the hunt was on,\" Lapatin says.",

    "fullText": "Toyota has taken a major step toward its sustainability goals by introducing its first-ever electric pickup truck, according to InsideEVs. The Toyota Hilux, which was first showcased in Thailand, features a 193-horsepower dual-motor setup that delivers four-wheel drive capability.\n\nNow in its ninth generation, the Hilux comes equipped with a 59.2-kilowatt-hour battery pack and can tow up to 3,527 pounds. Toyota estimates a 150-mile driving range — a practical fit for short-distance routes on farms, work sites, and in cities.\n\nSean Hanley, Toyota Australia's vice president for sales and marketing, called the electric Hilux \"another important step\" in Toyota's decarbonization strategy, per Car Sauce.\n\nEVs like the Hilux offer several consumer benefits: They eliminate gas station stops, require less routine maintenance, operate more quietly, and produce no tailpipe pollution. On the safety side, you also don't have to worry about carbon monoxide poisoning from your car.\n\nWhile not impact-free, EVs still generate far less heat-trapping pollution over their lifetime than gas cars. Lithium mining does create pollution, but it's a fraction of the 16.5 billion tons of dirty fuels extracted and burned each year.\n\nEVs can also be recharged at home. This is far cheaper than relying on public chargers and is actually saving drivers hundreds of dollars annually. For those taking their first steps in their EV journey, Qmerit helps homeowners install Level 2 EV chargers and provides free, instant installation estimates.\n\nHomeowners can go even further in their cost savings adventure by pairing their EV with solar panels for cheap electricity. This environmental hack reduces electricity bills by not needing to rely on the grid for power and by generating electricity directly from your own roof.\n\nTo explore even deeper, TCD's Solar Explorer connects homeowners with vetted installers, helping them save up to $10,000 on solar installation by curating competitive bids. A partner, for example, is EnergySage, which makes it easy to connect with vetted installers and receive quotes to save on solar installations.\n\nIn a Reuters article, senior scientist and director of the Systems Assessment Center at Argonne's Energy Division, Michael Wang, said that EVs \"generally emit far less carbon over a 12-year lifespan.\"\n\nAccording to a Washington Post analysis, \"In all 50 states, it's cheaper for the everyday American to fill up with electrons — and much cheaper in some regions such as the Pacific Northwest, with low electricity rates and high gas prices.\"\n\nWhat would you value most in a new electric truck?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "These are today's mortgage and refinance rates. Home loan rates may seem very familiar because they haven't changed much for weeks. Lock in your rate today.",
    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage rates continue to move within a narrow lane, according to Zillow. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.03%, and the 15-year fixed rate is 5.42%. The rates you'll find locally are likely to vary quite a bit. Shop multiple mortgage lenders to get your best interest rate offer.\n\nMORE: See the mortgage lenders with the best rates this week.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nLearn whether now is a good time to refinance your mortgage.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how various mortgage terms and interest rates will impact your monthly payments.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use. It also considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when determining your estimated monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a more realistic idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.\n\nThe average 30-year mortgage rate today is 6.03%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is lower than with a shorter-term loan.\n\nThe average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.42% today. When deciding between a 15-year and a 30-year mortgage, consider your short-term versus long-term goals.\n\nA 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because you’ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and that’s 15 fewer years for interest to accumulate. But the trade-off is that your monthly payment will be higher as you pay off the same amount in half the time.\n\nLet’s say you get a $300,000 mortgage. With a 30-year term and a 6.03% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,804, and you’d pay $349,599 in interest over the life of your loan — on top of that original $300,000.\n\nIf you get that same $300,000 mortgage with a 15-year term and a 5.42% rate, your monthly payment would jump to $2,439. But you’d only pay $138,936 in interest over the years.\n\nWith a fixed-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for the entire life of your loan. You will get a new rate if you refinance your mortgage, though.\n\nAn adjustable-rate mortgage keeps your rate the same for a predetermined period of time. Then, the rate will go up or down depending on several factors, such as the economy and the maximum amount your rate can change according to your contract. For example, with a 7/1 ARM, your rate would be locked in for the first seven years, then change every year for the remaining 23 years of your term.\n\nAdjustable rates typically start lower than fixed rates, but once the initial rate-lock period ends, it’s possible your rate will go up. Lately, though, some fixed rates have been starting lower than adjustable rates. Talk to your lender about its rates before choosing one or the other.\n\nRead more about fixed-rate vs. adjustable-rate mortgages.\n\nMortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, great or excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So, if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes.\n\nWaiting for rates to drop probably isn’t the best method to get the lowest mortgage rate right now. If you’re ready to buy, focusing on your personal finances is probably the best way to lower your rate.\n\nTo find the best mortgage lender for your situation, apply for mortgage preapproval with three or four companies. Just be sure to apply to all of them within a short time frame — doing so will give you the most accurate comparisons and have less of an impact on your credit score.\n\nWhen choosing a lender, don’t just compare interest rates. Look at the mortgage annual percentage rate (APR) — this factors in the interest rate, any discount points, and fees. The APR, which is also expressed as a percentage, reflects the true annual cost of borrowing money. This is probably the most important number to look at when comparing mortgage lenders.\n\nLearn 6 tips for choosing a mortgage lender.\n\nAccording to Zillow, the national average 30-year mortgage rate for purchasing a home is 6.03%, and the average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.42%. But these are national averages, so the average in your area could be different. Averages are typically higher in expensive parts of the U.S. and lower in less expensive areas.\n\nThe average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.03% right now, according to Zillow. However, you might get an even better rate with an excellent credit score, sizable down payment, and low debt-to-income ratio (DTI).\n\nEconomists don't expect drastic mortgage rate drops before the end of 2026. Even with the recent cut to the federal funds rate, mortgage rates continue to hover within a range — barely moving since mid-October.\n\nThe best mortgage lenders offer low interest rates, a range of loan programs, and high customer satisfaction. Choose the best mortgage lender for your needs.\n\nTo refinance your mortgage, you need a certain amount of home equity. The rules vary by loan type and refi program. Learn how much equity you need to refinance.\n\nYou can usually refinance your mortgage with the same bank or lender, but you don’t have to. Learn the pros and cons of using the same lender.\n\nYou can get a low-cost refinance by shopping for mortgage lenders or boosting your credit score. Learn how to lower your refi costs, both at closing and long term.\n\nIf you want to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025, you're in luck. It may be a good time. Learn the steps to take to refi in the next couple of months.\n\nA mortgage refinance can cost 2% to 6% of the loan amount. Learn what impacts these costs and how to lower or eliminate what you pay up front.",

    "fullText": "The holidays are a time for celebration, family gatherings and indulgent feasts ― but for emergency room doctors, they’re also one of the busiest times of the year.\n\nEvery year, emergency departments see a predictable surge in visits between Thanksgiving and New Year’s. Between foodborne illnesses, respiratory infections and accidents in the kitchen, there are plenty of incidents that keep them busy. The good news? Most of these visits are preventable.\n\nHealth: These COVID Symptoms Are Red Flags That You Need Medical Attention\n\nWe asked emergency medicine physicians across the country to share the habits they rely on to keep themselves and their families healthy during this holiday season. Their advice is surprisingly simple — and could save your celebration from taking a seriously unpleasant turn.\n\nAccording to Dr. Alexis Halpern, an emergency medicine physician at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, one of the biggest culprits behind holiday illnesses starts right in the kitchen.\n\n“It’s always important to clean surfaces and cutting boards immediately after handling raw meat, poultry and fish because any bacteria that was present can live on surfaces for some time ― hours to even weeks,” she said. “If this touches other foods, which won’t be cooked, they can be transferred to those foods and cause anyone who consumes them to become sick.”\n\nHalpern recommended a simple but thorough cleaning process: “First remove all food debris, use hot water and a mild dish soap (depending on the surface), then use a food-safe sanitizer… If using dish towels to dry the surfaces, also put them in the laundry rather than continue using them.”\n\nMust Read: The Single Riskiest Food On Your Thanksgiving Table, According To Scientists\n\nHer advice extends beyond the kitchen. “Upper respiratory viruses, which are common in the winter, can live on anything that people touch, like doorknobs, elevator buttons, cell phones and countertops, for a few hours to even a few days depending on the virus,” she said.\n\n“Wash your hands whenever you come in from outside, after you’ve been with a lot of people, and if you’re shaking lots of hands. Also, never touch your face while you’re out because the eyes, nose, and mouth are easy places for viruses to enter your body.”\n\n“Staying current with vaccinations, especially for annual influenza and COVID-19, remains the most effective strategy to prevent these viral illnesses and their complications,” said Dr. Peggy Tseng Ji, an emergency medicine physician.\n\nThis is especially crucial for high-risk groups: “Vaccination substantially reduces hospitalization and mortality in high-risk populations,” she noted. Her advice: “Get your vaccines updated as early as you can during the cold and flu season, which starts in October and peaks between December and February.”\n\nHealth: Flu Is Increasing Right Now — And These Regions Are Seeing The Biggest Spikes\n\nJi makes sure to keep washing her hands to stay virus-free during the season as well.\n\n“Hand washing with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand sanitizers may not be groundbreaking, but evidence consistently shows that this old-fashioned habit reduces the incidence of acute respiratory infections,” she explained.\n\n“Wash your hands with soap and water for about 20 seconds, cleaning both palms, between the fingers, and all fingertips. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers can be used when soap and water are unavailable but should contain at least 60% alcohol.”\n\nThis is especially important if you are playing with pets or during food preparation, added Dr. Gauthami Soma, a Yale Medicine pediatric emergency medicine specialist and assistant professor at Yale School of Medicine.\n\nHoliday meals often stretch for hours ― but that spread of stuffing, gravy and turkey left on the counter might be a ticking time bomb. Dr. Kirsten Bechtel, a pediatric emergency medicine specialist at Yale Medicine, warned that food safety mistakes are a common reason for holiday ER visits.\n\n“The danger zone for bacteria to grow in prepared/cooked food is 40 degrees to 140 degrees Fahrenheit,” Bechtel said. “Food should be cooled before refrigeration.”\n\nHealth: The Holiday Tasks That Are Secretly Depleting You\n\nHer rule of thumb: “Any prepared/cooked or cold food should not be left out longer than two hours.” To stay safe, she recommends keeping cold dishes on ice and hot dishes above 140 degrees Fahrenheit using chafing dishes or crockpots. “If you want to heat up leftovers in the microwave, make sure to reheat it so that it is above 165 degrees Fahrenheit or steaming hot.”\n\nWhile keeping food hot, be mindful of the dangers hot foods pose to little ones. “Hot cooked items on the stove can cause burns if tipped and in contact with skin ― remember to put stove items on the farthest back burner and turn the handle inwards and away from toddlers trying to reach,” Soma said.\n\nNo matter how prepared you are, it helps to have essentials on hand at home. Halpern suggested keeping a few key medications ready for unexpected events, like a snowstorm or hurricane.\n\n“It’s never a bad idea to have fever reducers and pain medications, such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen,” Halpern said. “It’s also a good idea to have diphenhydramine, which can be used if someone has an allergic reaction, especially if you are having guests who may have food and other allergies nobody knows about.”\n\nHealth: If You Love Someone With Addiction, This Has Been A Hell Of A Week\n\nShe added: “Be sure to hold onto the instructions for safe usage, for both adults and weight-based dosing for kids… and be sure they have child-resistant caps.”\n\nWhen in crowded gatherings or when caring for someone who’s sick, it’s always best to put on a mask, Ji said.\n\n“Masks act as a physical barrier, limiting the spread of infectious particles from both asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals,” she explained. “When I was sick with COVID-19, I wore an N95 around my family at all times … I was able to continue caring for both my children and breastfeeding my infant without infecting anyone else.”\n\nShe recommended N95 respirators for the best protection, followed by surgical masks. “For maximum protection, wear masks consistently and correctly ― covering both the nose and mouth ― especially in crowded or poorly ventilated spaces,” Ji said.\n\nEven with all the right precautions, illnesses happen. But knowing when to go to the doctor ― or the emergency room ― can be lifesaving.\n\nHalpern emphasized the importance of listening to your body: “Winter colds and viruses are common and can range from cough, congestion, and sore throat, to headache, body aches, fever, vomiting and diarrhea.”\n\nHowever, certain symptoms require urgent care. “If these symptoms progress to feeling short of breath, as in you cannot get enough air in or you’re breathing very quickly, severe weakness or lethargy, or fever above 103 that is lasting for days or not responding to fever-reducing medications, it is important to seek medical attention,” Halpern said.\n\nShe also cautioned against ignoring severe dehydration: “If you cannot stop vomiting, are having persistent diarrhea or you stop urinating, you could be severely dehydrated … Please be seen in person so you can receive IV fluids and have electrolytes repleted as needed.”\n\nIf you are experiencing any of these symptoms yourself or know of someone who is, take a trip to the nearest urgent care facility or emergency room immediately. “We’d rather see you, tell you you’re going to be okay and send you home with supportive care and medications, than have you stay at home and become dangerously ill,” Halpern said.\n\nThere's 1 Sneaky Way Your Holiday Plans May Be Causing You More Stress\n\nThe Toxic Phrase We Need To Stop Saying Around The Holidays\n\nHow Risky Is It To Drink Eggnog?

    "fullText": "ROME (AP) — Pope Leo XIV urged Vatican cardinals on Monday to put their ambitions of power and personal interests aside, as he followed in Pope Francis’ footsteps and used a Christmas greeting to gently criticize his closest collaborators.\n\n“Is it possible to be friends in the Roman Curia?” Leo asked the cardinals and bishops who make up the Curia, as the Holy See bureaucracy is known. “To have relationships of genuine fraternal friendship?”\n\nThe fact that Leo asked the question suggests that the American pope knows well that the Curia remains a difficult and sometimes toxic workplace, one that Francis would often eviscerate in his annual Christmas addresses.\n\nLeo didn’t repeat Francis’ more biting critique — that Vatican clergy sometimes suffer from “spiritual Alzheimers,” the “cancer” of cliques, the “corruption” of ambition and “self-absorbed” idle gossip — and his tone was far more gentle and constructive.\n\nBut the underlying message remained. Leo, who was very close to Francis and worked in the Vatican for two years before his election, didn’t shy away from Francis’ tradition of using the Christmas occasion to urge Vatican bureaucrats to examine their consciences and change their ways for the good of the church.\n\n“At times this bitterness finds its way among us as well, when, after many years of service in the Curia, we observe with disappointment that certain dynamics — linked to the exercise of power, the desire to prevail, or the pursuit of personal interests — are slow to change,” Leo said.\n\n“Amid daily toil, it is a grace to find trustworthy friends, where masks fall away, no one is used or sidelined, genuine support is offered, and each person’s worth and competence are respected, preventing resentment and dissatisfaction.”\n\nAfter Francis’ sometimes tumultuous 12-year pontificate, in which the Argentine Jesuit at times alienated conservatives and some in the Vatican bureaucracy, Leo has generally sought to be more of a peacemaker prizing unity.\n\nHe called Monday for Vatican bureaucrats to work to forge communion within the church and beyond.\n\n“In a world wounded by discord, violence and conflict, where we also witness a growth in aggression and anger, often exploited by both the digital sphere and politics, Christmas invites everyone to work for peace and universal fraternity,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "Prisons and lockups that jailed tens of thousands of people during Assad’s rule are now crowded with Syrians detained by President Ahmed al-Sharaa’s security forces and held without formal charges.\n\nThe first wave of detentions in the new Syria came almost immediately – just after victorious rebels flung open the doors of Bashar al-Assad’s notorious prisons.\n\nAs ordinary Syrians stormed detention complexes last December to search for loved ones who had vanished under Assad’s rule, thousands of the deposed dictator’s soldiers who had abandoned their posts – officers and conscripts alike – were taken prisoner by the rebels.\n\nThen came the second wave in late winter: Hundreds of people from Assad’s Alawite sect, mostly men, were seized by the new authorities throughout Syria. Their detentions spiked after a brief uprising along the coast in March killed dozens of security forces, sparking reprisals that left nearly 1,500 Alawites dead. Those arrests continue to this day.\n\nBeginning in the summer, there was another round of mass detentions, this time in the south among the minority Druze community. It came after hundreds died in an outbreak of sectarian violence, with government forces accused of summary executions and other abuses.\n\nThroughout, there were other detentions from all denominations in the name of security: large numbers of people, many from Syria’s Sunni majority, accused of vague links to Assad; human-rights activists; Christians who say they have been shaken down for information or money; Shi’ites picked up at checkpoints and accused of ties with Iran or Hezbollah.\n\nPrisons and lockups that jailed tens of thousands of people during Assad’s rule are now crowded with Syrians detained by President Ahmed al-Sharaa’s security forces and held without formal charges, a Reuters investigation has found.\n\nInterviews, lists of detainees, and multiple accounts of overcrowding in the prisons and lockups suggest that the number of security detainees is considerably higher than the tally that Reuters was able to establish.\n\nSome of the abuses that Syrians hoped would end with Assad have been revived by men working for the government that replaced him: detentions without charge or a paper trail, some of the same methods of abuse and torture, and deaths in custody that go unrecorded, according to dozens of interviews. Some detainees have fallen prey to extortion, according to interviews with 14 families. Five of the families reported receiving communications from alleged jailers or intermediaries demanding money in exchange for a relative’s release.\n\nIn December 2024, Sharaa pledged to “close the notorious prisons” of the fallen dictator. But Reuters found that at least 28 prisons and lockups from the Assad era have been operational again over the past year.\n\nAsked for comment on the findings of this report, Syria’s Information Ministry said that the need to bring those involved in Assad’s abuses to justice explained many of the detentions and the reopening of some facilities.\n\n“The number of people involved in crimes and violations in Syria under the former regime is very large, given the scale of the abuses committed,” the ministry said. “There are past crimes, involvement in new violations, and threats to security and stability by those associated with the regime, in addition to other crimes.”\n\nThe government said far more Syrians had been freed over the past year than are currently detained, but provided no numbers.\n\nThe detention facilities identified by Reuters include major prisons, large lockups located in vast complexes once run by Assad’s intelligence apparatus, and smaller lockups at checkpoints and police stations. Prisoners held at these facilities have little legal recourse, and at least 80 families said they lost track of their loved ones for months on end. Access to lawyers and family members varies across facilities, and public charges are rarely filed against security detainees, unlike those accused of common crimes.\n\nAcross Syria, detainees and families described inhumane conditions they or their relatives endured when locked up – overcrowding, scarce food, outbreaks of skin disease from a lack of soap. Both security detainees and people accused of common crimes said abuse and neglect were rife in the detention facilities where they were held. Forty people who were either former detainees or family members of detainees also described abuse and sometimes torture, particularly in the lockups.\n\nIn total, over 140 Syrians were interviewed for this report, including former detainees, relatives, lawyers, and human rights activists. Reuters also reviewed communications between jailers and detainees’ families, as well as photos of injuries from alleged torture.\n\nIn its statement, the government said Syria’s legal, judicial, and security institutions needed to be rebuilt after Assad’s fall. Because of “this difficult reality, there are vacuums that lead to negative consequences that violate policies in some cases,” it said.\n\nThe government said 84 members of the security forces had been disciplined for incidents of extortion involving detainees and 75 for violence.\n\nSince January, Syria’s Interior Ministry has announced more than 100 arrests for alleged abuses during the Assad era. The Reuters count doesn’t include these people, who are named and face specific accusations.\n\nThe conditions described in the prisons and lockups do not approach the brutality of Assad’s rule. The fallen dictator presided over the disappearance of more than 100,000 Syrians during the civil war. Mass graves that his government created to hide the dead are still being discovered. All told, more than 300,000 Syrian civilians perished in the war, according to UN estimates from 2022. Assad’s father, Hafez, ruled with similar ruthlessness. Both oversaw a system marked by torture, extortion, and summary execution on an industrial scale.\n\nBut human rights advocates say the mass detentions and disappearances have cast a shadow over Sharaa’s government, which came to power on promises to take Syria out of more than five decades of single-family rule. The new leadership is struggling to fulfill those promises, as Reuters has documented in a series of articles this year.\n\nThe effort to rebuild the country has implications far beyond Syria. The Trump administration has embraced Sharaa as an ally in regional stability and the effort to hold Islamic State extremists in check. Asked to comment on the prison conditions described in this report, a senior US administration official said President Donald Trump “is committed to supporting a Syria that is stable, unified, and at peace with itself and its neighbors.”\n\nThe UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a statement on December 5 that it had documented “distressing accounts of summary executions, arbitrary killings and abductions” since Assad’s fall.\n\nThameen al-Kheetan, a spokesperson for the UN rights office, told Reuters the commission is unable to compile a registry of security detentions. “It remains challenging to determine with precision how many individuals are still detained, how many have been released, or which cases may amount to enforced disappearance,” he said. “In some instances, families may also hesitate to share information out of fear of repercussions.”\n\nOn November 25, thousands of Alawites in the Mediterranean coastal regions protested against sectarian attacks and for the release of community members who disappeared after being detained. The demonstrations were some of the largest since Assad’s fall.\n\nSednaya, the Damascus prison most notorious under Assad as a place of torture, disappearance, and death, was among the facilities shut down as soon as the dictator fell. It remains empty and is one of several detention facilities that the government said had been shut.\n\nStill, Reuters found that two Damascus sites the government said were closed – Mezzeh airbase and the Khateeb detention center – have been operational during the past year.\n\nAmer Matar, a journalist and filmmaker focused on human rights, said he was held for a total of four months in different detention facilities under Assad. When the dictatorship ended, he made a point of visiting multiple detention sites and photocopying documents. He aimed to help tens of thousands of families trace relatives and hold perpetrators accountable through an online portal, the Syria Prisons Museum, which provides open access to the files, photographs, and other evidence he collects.\n\nWhen he visited Khateeb in February, he said he was initially blocked because he was told there were again prisoners inside. But Matar said he managed to enter and saw men crammed into a cell where he had been held for 16 days under Assad.\n\nMatar also went to the Harasta detention center in Damascus, once run by Assad’s air intelligence unit and infamous for torture. Guards told him there were new prisoners, but all the guards nevertheless let him inside.\n\nMatar was traveling to neighboring Lebanon in September, carrying recorded interviews with Syrian families stored on a hard drive, when he said he was stopped at passport control. At the border crossing terminal, he said he was stunned to be hauled into a cell and accused of smuggling confidential documents.\n\nOn the walls, he observed several hand-drawn calendars, all dated 2025. Matar knew from experience under Assad how to leave his own mark. He said he picked apart a pack of cigarettes, twisted the foil lining into a point, and scribbled: “Justice! Even if the world falls apart!”\n\nSharaa’s pledge to build a new Syria requires holding Assad’s enablers accountable for their crimes, while moving the country on from a devastating civil war that began in 2011 and ended with Assad’s exile in Moscow last December.\n\nAs Sharaa promised in mid-December last year to close prisons, his rebel forces were capturing soldiers from Assad’s army. Many were conscripts – men forced into the military with little choice in where or how they fought. Some were officers.\n\nAll have been detained in facilities where past abuses were prevalent. There are no publicly available lists of their names, and the government has not disclosed where they’re held.\n\nThe government also has not said how many soldiers have been detained or if they are considered prisoners of war, a status that would give them special legal protection.\n\nSome have received amnesty through negotiations with the government, through informal mediation by community leaders, activists, and clerics, or directly with the government’s civil peace committee, formally known as the Supreme Committee for the Preservation of Civil Peace.\n\nAmong the soldiers freed through intervention by the government’s civil peace committee is a former conscript in his mid-20s. He fled to Iraq as the government collapsed, then returned after Syria’s new leadership pledged to question soldiers and release those not responsible for crimes. He asked that his identity be withheld.\n\nHe said he was among the first wave of arrests after Assad fell, spent half a year in Damascus’ Adra prison, and was released in May after his family made repeated calls to the civil peace committee.\n\nFree now for eight months, he said he still lacks documentation confirming that he has been cleared. He fears he could be detained again at any moment. Syrian authorities have been issuing ID cards to some former soldiers, but he has not yet received one.\n\n“I'm in a bigger jail now,” said the young soldier, who rarely ventures out of his home. He spoke to Reuters at a farmhouse near the Mediterranean Sea, where drought had cracked the earth under his family's citrus trees.\n\nThe detainee lists contain names of soldiers held in prisons in Damascus, Homs, Hama, and Afrin. There, they are imprisoned with other Syrians detained on security grounds and people accused of common crimes. The organizers of the family visits showed the lists to Reuters.\n\nAnother former detainee at Adra, the Damascus prison that is among Syria’s largest, said inmates needed to sleep on their sides because the cells were so packed. The former detainee, who is Sunni, said there was no medicine or warm water for bathing. His daily diet consisted of a few olives and dates, and one piece of bread, he said. During his nearly two-month detention, he said he lost more than 20 kilograms.\n\nThe government reported that Adra currently has 3,599 inmates, slightly exceeding its capacity of 3,550, including 439 security detainees. For all the facilities, the government said, “the current reality is not the desired reality, but we are in the period of building institutions and rehabilitating prisons, and yet the humanitarian situation has improved significantly.”\n\nAdditionally, the government stated that some lockups are currently used to detain individuals during ongoing legal proceedings.\n\nDetainees who were held in lockups in the Damascus neighborhoods of Kafr Sousa and Mezzeh describe some of the most harrowing conditions. Assad’s intelligence services ran both facilities during the civil war.\n\nNew prisoners began filling parts of the Kafr Sousa detention facility as early as February, said Matar, who visited then. It had emptied after Assad’s fall.\n\nOne detainee, an Alawite who was picked up with his brother in mid-May, said he was held in both Kafr Sousa and a facility in the Mezzeh neighborhood that was once used by Assad’s political-security branch. The man said that a neighbor’s complaint about noise on their street led to a raid on the family home in May by the Internal Security Forces, the national law enforcement agency still commonly referred to by its former name, General Security Services (GSS).\n\nThe officers took them into custody after checking their IDs, which identified their birthplace as Latakia, a region that is majority Alawite, an offshoot of Shi’ite Islam followed by the Assad family.\n\nAt the Mezzeh political-security lockup, he said 30 men shared a single cell. He saw his brother there once, when new inmates were having their heads forcibly shaved. Guards ordered the men to keep their eyes on the floor, a practice prevalent during Assad’s rule.\n\n“It was my first time in detention, and it was very hard on me,” he said.\n\nThere, the man was interrogated for a week. His captors flogged him with cables and accused him of being an Assad sympathizer.\n\nHe stated that he was then transferred to the detention facility at Kafr Sousa, located elsewhere in Damascus. He caught sight of his brother there again, his face bruised. They said nothing, because prisoners weren’t allowed to speak to each other.\n\nThere, his new interrogators questioned him about his religion. “Do you pray?” Do you worship God?” But he said it was worse for former soldiers: “They came from interrogation with smashed bones, unable to walk.”\n\nTwo weeks after his arrest, an interrogator blindfolded him and forced him to sign a document with an inked finger, then loaded him into a car.\n\nThey dropped him on a Damascus street, he said, with one final order: “Don’t look back and don’t remove the blindfold until we are gone.” He never saw the document and has no idea what was written on it. He does not know what happened to his brother.\n\nUnder Assad, the detention system became as much a generator of large-scale profit for people who worked there – jailkeepers, judges, and lawyers – as a tool for crushing dissent. According to a 2024 UN report, “massive bribes” were an essential part of securing the release of detainees or advancing their legal proceedings.\n\nDespite the new government’s promises to combat corruption, 14 families and four lawyers recounted getting demands for money in exchange for freeing a detainee. Most reported being unsure who was contacting them or what the relationship between the jailer and the extortionist on the phone was.\n\nThe amounts demanded appear arbitrary. Families of ordinary detainees – conscripts, farmers, blue-collar workers – are asked to pay anywhere between $500 and $15,000.\n\nFamilies of military officers, people who influenced Assad, or those believed to be well-off, said they receive far higher demands. Six families reported that the ransom demanded by the individuals who contacted them exceeded 1 billion Syrian lira, or $90,000.\n\nAmong the missing are several members of a single Alawite family who vanished during the March killings on the coast. A WhatsApp conversation between the sister of one of the men and someone who claimed to be his jailer began at the end of March.\n\nOne exchange, seen by Reuters, shows the jailer set a deadline and demanded $3,000 in cash for the release of all of the men except one, who he said had died.\n\nThe text exchanges continued until October without a resolution. At one point, the family asked about the conditions.\n\nWhen the family asked how the men were doing, the jailer said, “ What do you think the conditions are for a prisoner? …There’s torture and being suspended by the wrists.”\n\nThe family didn’t have the money to pay, and the jailer refused to tell them which of the men had died or provide proof that the others were still alive.\n\n“When the money is ready, come to Idlib to see them,” the jailer wrote.\n\nAnother family shared an audio recording of demands to pay 100 million Syrian lira – the equivalent of $9,000 – for an army officer who they say was seized on December 31, 2024, on his way to surrender to the new government.\n\nThis is the exchange between a desperate relative of the officer and his alleged captor, who called from the detained man’s mobile phone that day:\n\nJailer: “Bring 100 million and come.”\n\nRelative: “What? 100 million. Where do I get this money? If I sell this house, it won't get 100 million.”\n\nJailer: “Listen, listen, listen then, you’ll never see him alive again.”\n\nThe family stated that it did not have the funds to pay. They have heard nothing since.\n\nSometimes paying the captors does not guarantee safety.\n\nA 50-year-old farmer from a village in the province of Homs said he was grabbed twice by Internal Security Forces officers.\n\nThe first time, in March, two pickups marked “Internal Security” pulled up loaded with armed and masked men in black uniforms, he said. They surrounded his house, blindfolded him and his teenage son, and took them to the local police lockup to interrogate them about who in town had weapons.\n\nThe farmer said they forced his head and limbs into a car tire to immobilize him – a practice called the “dolab,” Arabic for tire, that started under Assad. They then beat him and his son bloody.\n\nThroughout the ordeal, he said, his captors insulted him: “You are infidels, you are pigs.” The farmer shared pictures of the bruised soles of his feet and stitches across his ankles. A religious leader who acts as a mediator with the security forces confirmed the account.\n\nThe farmer was told a payment of $4,000 would secure their release. The officers released them to raise the money. The vehicle that picked up the cash, he said, was also marked “Internal Security” – like the ones carrying the men who had detained them in the first place. But the next day, another marked car arrived to take him back to the police station, he said.\n\nThis time, he was beaten unconscious. It was a stroke of luck.\n\nThe men sent him back to his family in a blanket, thinking he was dead, the farmer said. Friends smuggled him and his son out of Syria, where they remain.\n\nSyrians have their own vocabulary of torture, coined over five decades of dictatorship and expanded during 14 years of civil war. That vocabulary, according to detainees of the new government, has survived the fall of Assad.\n\nThere is the “dolab” or tire experienced by the farmer. “Shabeh” is the practice of suspending a victim from his wrists. The “welcome party” – or “haflat istaqbal” – happens on arrival, when jailers line the corridor, and rain blows upon new detainees.\n\nOne young Alawite man said he was detained on March 9 in Latakia after he ventured outside during a government crackdown in response to the pro-Assad uprising. Black-clad officers pulled his jacket over his head, yanked off his shoes, and bundled him into their car over suspicions he was filming the movements of security forces with his phone.\n\nThe young Alawite said his abuse started immediately with a “welcome party” at the military security branch in the coastal region.\n\n“Everyone ordered me to bark like a dog. They beat me with the butts of their rifles, their fists, their boots,” he said. “I thought my life was coming to an end.”\n\nFrom there, he said, he was taken to three other lockups in Latakia, all used during the Assad era, and each with its own welcome party. His ankles hung him, he said, with a pistol shoved in his mouth. He was put alone in a windowless room for 20 days.\n\nTwice while being transferred, the young man said, his jailers mused about killing him and dropping his body into the sea because the lockups had become overcrowded.\n\nFinally, after four months, he was freed, still barefoot. His captors had never replaced the shoes torn off when he was seized.\n\nThe government stated that the Interior Ministry’s policies complied with Syrian law, which it said guaranteed access to a lawyer. The government also said extrajudicial detention is permissible “to prevent an imminent threat or the outbreak of violence.”\n\nIn late November, the Interior Ministry published a new code of conduct for its officers that, among other things, instructs them to “preserve and reinforce human rights, treat everyone with dignity and in accordance with international laws.” It specifically prohibits torture, allowing use of force “within approved limits.”\n\nAmong the dead was a detainee at Kafr Sousa, a 59-year-old Christian merchant named Milad al-Farkh. His family said he was arrested on August 24 on allegations of hiding weapons, working as an arms dealer, and selling expired meat at his butcher shop.\n\nFarkh’s family described the arrest as an attempt to pressure them into paying $10,000 in protection money.\n\nTwo weeks later, an inmate at Kafr Sousa managed to get a call out to the family to tell them al-Farkh was near death from torture. The call from the hospital morgue came the next day, on September 9, the family said.\n\nOne relative was arrested for demanding an autopsy. Finally, after intervention by a senior Internal Security official and clerics, doctors concluded al-Farkh had died from hitting his head in a fall, and the body was released to the family. They have yet to see the autopsy report or any written record of his arrest or death.\n\nOn September 25, after the family petitioned for an investigation into Farkh’s death, the Interior Ministry announced they had searched his house and found a bomb. The family denies there were any explosives at the house.\n\nThree families said they learned of the deaths of relatives only after their bodies were buried. Among these were three men detained in Homs in January – an army veteran and his two sons, who were also Assad-era soldiers. Their family said they last saw the three being led away by Internal Security officers.\n\nThe governor’s office told them the men were at the central prison in Homs. For five months, they said, they visited regularly to leave food, medicine, and fresh clothes, and retrieve dirty laundry that they were told belonged to the three. They reported that they paid thousands of dollars to unidentified intermediaries but were never permitted to see the men.\n\nFinally, two relatives went to a morgue in desperation and persuaded an employee there to go through digital photos of unidentified bodies. That was when the family discovered the men had been dead since January.\n\nWritten autopsy comments beneath the photos said the 62-year-old father had his throat slit, two family members recalled. One son had his face disfigured and skin flayed from his body, and a bullet to the face killed the other, they said. They were not permitted to keep any documentation, including the autopsies, they said. Reuters was unable to obtain the photos or reports.\n\nThe offices of the governors of Homs, Tartous, and Latakia did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Syrian Network for Human Rights started documenting abuses under Assad in 2011 and has continued to release monthly reports on arbitrary detentions. Over the course of 2025, the group documented 16 deaths in detention under the new government.\n\nIn its latest report, released in early December, SNHR called on Syria’s new leaders “to establish legal regulations that will put an end to the harrowing era of arbitrary arrests and enforced disappearances.”\n\nMatar’s experience of imprisonment under the new government was brief, but mentally taxing. The journalist and filmmaker said he was released within 24 hours at the border checkpoint with Lebanon without being charged.\n\n“Anyone suspected of tampering with documents and evidence is dealt with according to the laws and regulations, as was the case with Amer Matar,” the government said.\n\nHe has no papers to prove that he was ever held or freed.\n\n“The regime fell, but those ruling today decided to turn the Assad prisons into new prisons,” Matar said. “I swear to God, it’s the most absurd thing I have ever seen.”\n\nMatar said he never recovered his hard drive from the checkpoint officers. He arrived in Lebanon 10 days later. He hasn’t returned to Syria since.",

    "description": "U. President Donald Trump is preparing for a more aggressive immigration crackdown in 2026 with billions in new funding, including by raiding more workplaces — even as backlash builds ahead of next year’s midterm elections.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 21 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is preparing for a more aggressive immigration crackdown in 2026 with billions in new funding, including by raiding more workplaces — even as backlash builds ahead of next year’s midterm elections.\n\nTrump has already surged immigration agents into major U.S. cities, where they swept through neighborhoods and clashed with residents. While ​federal agents this year conducted some high-profile raids on businesses, they largely avoided raiding farms, factories and other businesses that are economically important but known to employ immigrants without legal status.\n\nICE and Border Patrol ‌will get $170 billion in additional funds through September 2029 - a huge surge of funding over their existing annual budgets of about $19 billion after the Republican-controlled Congress passed a massive spending package in July.\n\nAdministration officials say they plan to hire thousands more agents, open new detention centers, pick up ‌more immigrants in local jails and partner with outside companies to track down people without legal status.\n\nThe expanded deportation plans come despite growing signs of political backlash ahead of next year’s midterm elections.\n\nMiami, one of the cities most affected by Trump’s crackdown because of its large immigrant population, elected its first Democratic mayor in nearly three decades last week in what the mayor-elect said was, in part, a reaction to the president. Other local elections and polling have suggested rising concern among voters wary of aggressive immigration tactics.\n\n\"People are beginning to see this not as an immigration question anymore as much as it is a violation of rights, a violation of due process and militarizing neighborhoods extraconstitutionally,\" said Mike Madrid, a moderate Republican ⁠political strategist. \"There is no question that is a problem for the president and Republicans.\"\n\nTrump’s ‌overall approval rating on immigration policy fell from 50% in March, before he launched crackdowns in several major U.S. cities, to 41% in mid-December, for what had been his strongest issue.\n\nRising public unease has focused on masked federal agents using aggressive tactics such as deploying tear gas in residential neighborhoods and detaining U.S. citizens.\n\nIn addition to expanding enforcement ‍actions, Trump has stripped hundreds of thousands of Haitian, Venezuelan and Afghan immigrants of temporary legal status, expanding the pool of people who could be deported as the president promises to remove 1 million immigrants each year – a goal he almost certainly will miss this year. So far, some 622,000 immigrants have been deported since Trump took office in January.\n\nWhite House border czar Tom Homan told Reuters Trump had delivered on his promise of a historic deportation operation and removing criminals while shutting down illegal immigration across ​the U.S.-Mexico border. Homan said the number of arrests will increase sharply as ICE hires more officers and expands detention capacity with the new funding.\n\n“I think you're going to see the numbers explode greatly next year,” Homan said.\n\nHoman ‌said the plans “absolutely” include more enforcement actions at workplaces.\n\nSarah Pierce, director of social policy at the center-left group Third Way, said U.S. businesses have been reluctant to push back on Trump's immigration crackdown in the past year but could be prompted to speak up if the focus turns to employers.\n\nPierce said it will be interesting to see \"whether or not businesses finally stand up to this administration.\"\n\nTrump, a Republican, recaptured the White House promising record levels of deportations, saying it was needed after years of high levels of illegal immigration under his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden. He kicked off a campaign that dispatched federal agents to U.S. cities in search of possible immigration offenders, sparking protests and lawsuits over racial profiling and violent tactics.\n\nSome businesses shut down to avoid raids or because of a lack of customers. Parents vulnerable to arrest kept their children home from school or had neighbors walk them. Some U.S. citizens started carrying passports.\n\nDespite ⁠the focus on criminals in its public statements, government data shows that the Trump administration has been arresting more people who have ​not been charged with any crimes beyond their alleged immigration violations than previous administrations.\n\nSome 41% of the roughly 54,000 people arrested by ICE ​and detained by late November had no criminal record beyond a suspected immigration violation, agency figures show. In the first few weeks in January, before Trump took office, just 6% of those arrested and detained by ICE were not facing charges for other crimes or previously convicted.\n\nThe Trump administration has taken aim at legal immigrants as well. Agents have arrested spouses of ‍U.S. citizens at their green card interviews, pulled people from ⁠certain countries out of their naturalization ceremonies, moments before they were to become citizens, and revoked thousands of student visas.\n\nThe administration’s planned focus on job sites in the coming year could generate many more arrests and affect the U.S. economy and Republican-leaning business owners.\n\nReplacing immigrants arrested during workplace raids could lead to higher labor costs, undermining Trump’s fight against inflation, which analysts expect to be a major issue ⁠in the closely watched November elections, determining control of Congress.\n\nAdministration officials earlier this year exempted such businesses from enforcement on Trump’s orders, then quickly reversed, Reuters reported at the time.\n\nSome immigration hardliners have called for more workplace enforcement.\n\n\"Eventually you’re going to have to go after these ‌employers,” said Jessica Vaughan, policy director for the Center for Immigration Studies, which backs lower levels of immigration. “When that starts happening the employers will start cleaning up their acts on their own.”",

    "title": "This Car Brand Has Dethroned Subaru As Consumer Reports' Most Reliable",
    "description": "Subaru has a reputation for dependability, but it wasn't 2025's most reliable brand according to Consumer Reports. Which brand claimed that honor, though?",
    "fullText": "Subaru has dropped to second place in Consumer Reports' annual vehicle reliability report, making way for Toyota. Subaru, Lexus, and Toyota have been in a constant battle for the top spot over the years, with Subaru breaking a back-and-forth fight between Lexus and Toyota in 2024 by snatching top spot from the two Toyota Motor Corporation brands. However, 2025 sees Toyota back in the number one spot.\n\nToyota reclaimed top spot primarily due to reliability improvements for its models in recent years. Consumer Reports noted that the Camry was significantly more reliable in 2025, making it the second-most reliable sedan in its study, tied with the Honda Accord (and behind another Toyota, the Crown). Another vehicle with improved reliability was the Toyota Tundra: its all-new platform and engine, introduced in 2022, suffered from manufacturing woes, but Toyota looks to have figured things out, and the pickup's 2026 model was much more reliable. Subaru fell to second place since most of its lineup is considered to have just \"above average\" reliability in CR's estimation.\n\nOne surprising change in 2025's reliability study was Tesla, which sat in ninth place. The controversial electric vehicle company moved up eight spots, largely due to the Model 3. Tesla still has a concerning number of quality issues, especially with the Cybertruck, which has below-average reliability. Still, the rate at which people have been reporting electrical, exterior, and software-related issues has lessened in 2025.\n\nOverall, Consumer Reports' study found that EVs are generally unreliable compared to hybrids. Twenty-eight out of 30 studied hybrids were rated with average or higher reliability (only the Hyundai Sonata Hybrid and Lincoln Nautilus Hybrid ranked below). Meanwhile, many EVs landed at the bottom of the reliability rankings, alongside PHEV vehicles. This includes the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Kia EV6, which suffer from reliability issues with their integrated charging control unit (ICCU), as well as the Cadillac Lyriq, Chevrolet Blazer EV, and Honda Prelude. Rivian and Lucid are also considered to produce unreliable vehicles overall.\n\nAll three of Consumer Reports' most reliable car brands saw recalls in 2025, proving that no vehicle is perfect. However, Consumer Reports has certain criteria it uses to calculate the reliability scores for its study. For 2025, Consumer Reports collected data from owners covering 380,000 vehicles from the 2000 to 2025 model years, along with a few 2026 models. The experts on Consumer Reports' panel then studied the data, weighing the severity of the reported issues according to how significantly they impact the owner's finances and safety. Vehicles with such issues received a lower score than those with more minor issues like faulty interior trim. The collected data from drivers is then combined with Consumer Reports' own track testing as well as crash-test data, listed safety features, and owner satisfaction surveys.\n\nIt's worth noting that Consumer Reports' experience shows that newer models are often more trouble since carmakers haven't ironed out all the issues quite yet. \"Even the second-year examples of a new model can have issues,\" Consumer Reports warned. \"When a car has a low score in its first year, it sometimes takes its automaker more time to address the problems. For example, both the gasoline and PHEV versions of the Mazda CX-70 and CX-90 remain unreliable in their second year, as do the Cadillac Lyriq, Chevrolet Blazer EV and Colorado, and the GMC Canyon.\" You may be better off buying a used car, although there are still things to watch out for.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

You're already behind.\n\nNot to be mean, but while you were spending the weekend resting up, some of your colleagues were locking in.\n\nA growing number of white-collar workers are putting in a few hours on their off days, writes BI's Amanda Hoover. And while it's not a massive number (one analysis pegged the number at 5%), it's on the rise (that figure rose 9% from 2023 to 2024).\n\nBefore you get out your pitchforks about protecting your precious work-life balance, understand these weekend warriors are sort of on your side.\n\nIt's more for their own benefit than any crazy workload. The people Amanda spoke to didn't position weekend work as a burden. Instead, they said they loved their jobs and found the extra hours offered them more flexibility during the week.\n\nI know some of you are still disgusted reading this. (Voluntarily working on the weekend! What kind of corporate shill are you?) But think of it as the weekend working for you.\n\nIt's like dieting. You could eat healthy all week and then crash out on the weekends, or enjoy a healthy diet all week long with some treats sprinkled in along the way.\n\nIt's only fair I disclose my bias: I crack open the work laptop on the occasional Sunday.\n\nSome of it is due to the nature of my job. How else do you expect an up-to-date Monday morning newsletter to get built?\n\n(Having a fantastic editor in the UK helps. Cheers, Hallam Bullock, I couldn't do it without you!)\n\nBut even before I was living in your inbox every morning, I'd check in for a few cheeky hours on a Saturday or Sunday.\n\nAs brutal as it is to give up some free time for work, it's a calculated move. Doing some work on Sunday can hopefully lead to an easier week ahead.\n\nThat calculation only works if you actually find yourself able to log off at a reasonable time during the week. Corporate America can be much more of a taker than a giver. And if you're not careful, your weekend warrioring might just make you available to take on even more work during the week.\n\nIt's that kind of cycle that can lead to burnout, and we know how that story ends.\n\nIt reminds me of advice I got one summer doing maintenance work at a college. Keen to make a good impression, I quickly started changing the air conditioner filters assigned to us. It wasn't long before my boss stopped me with a solemn face.\n\n\"Slow down, Dan. They'll always find new work for you.\"",

    "description": "Trump is touting tariff revenues and a shrinking trade deficit as his economic accomplishments ahead or midterms, but economists say it's complicated.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is working to sell his economic policies.\n\nTo convince the nation that the economy is improving ahead of the midterm elections, Trump is highlighting a reduced trade deficit and high tariff revenues as his key economic accomplishments since taking office.\n\nThe reality is more complicated.\n\nEconomists have told Business Insider that a smaller trade deficit and a record-breaking amount of tariff revenue can be poor indicators of overall economic health at best, and signs of economic trouble at worst.\n\n\"This idea that if we lower the trade deficit, we're going to buy from US companies and we're all better off — it's seductive for people to think that way,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a free-market think tank, told Business Insider. \"But it's just an incomplete view.\"\n\n'\"Unlike the budget deficit, the trade deficit is meaningless,\" Winegarden added. \"It has nothing to do with affordability, and it has nothing to do with growth, so it's a complete red herring.\"\n\nTrump is touring swing states, and he appeared on prime-time TV for a national economic address.\n\n\"Remember when I said 'tariff' — my favorite word is 'tariff,'\" Trump told a crowd in Pennsylvania, \"Tariffs are bringing us hundreds of billions of dollars.\"\n\n\"We had the worst trade deals ever made, and our country was laughed at from all over the world, but they're not laughing anymore,\" Trump added in the national speech last week.\n\nThe White House, in a December press release, also touted that \"the trade deficit has narrowed to its smallest since mid-2020\" in September, citing it as \"more proof that President Donald J. Trump's America First trade agenda is working.\"\n\nKimberly Clausing, professor of tax law and policy at the UCLA School of Law and a previous official at the US Department of the Treasury, told Business Insider that despite the negative association with the word \"deficit,\" a smaller trade deficit could simply mean that people are pulling back on spending and investing overall.\n\n\"In the United States in recent years, a declining trade deficit is often associated with a weak economy, due to reduced consumption and investment,\" said Clausing. \"That may be the case now as well, since some market indicators show economic weakness.\"\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the total volume of both exports and imports, adjusted for inflation, was in decline for three months preceding August.\n\nDespite a steady stock market, the US economy is showing signs of weakness.\n\nWhile inflation slowed in November, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that the data may have been impacted by the government shutdown.\n\n\"Tariff measures are already exerting measurable upward pressure on consumer prices,\" according to a report published in October by the Federal Reserve of St. Louis that looked at data from January to August of this year. \"The rise in prices beginning in early 2025 coincides closely with tariff developments.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the country lost 105,000 jobs in October and added 64,000 jobs in November, while the unemployment rate rose to a four-year high of 4.6% in the past month.\n\nIn domestic manufacturing, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported 12,706,000 employees in the sector as of September 2025, down 49,000 from a base of 12,755,000 employees at the end of January 2025, when Trump took office.\n\nWinegarden said that tariffs create an opportunity cost, because when more money is spent either by paying taxes on a foreign good or on a domestic product that is more expensive, that reduces the nation's power to buy, invest, and hire.\n\n\"When you're buying the least cost-efficient option, you're subsidizing jobs that are less efficient, and sentiments aside, that's bad for long-term job creation,\" said Winegarden.\n\nJason Furman, professor of the practice of economic policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, also told Business Insider that the perception that tariffs have decreased trade deficits may be false to begin with, and they did not create any fiscal benefits for the nation.\n\n\"The trade deficit — it has not actually narrowed. There has just been a timing shift,\" said Furman. \"What happened was a lot of imports were pulled forward and ended up being unusually large in Dec 2024 through March 2025,\"\n\nAccording to the US Census Bureau's International Trade in Goods and Services report, the national trade deficit was $95.2 billion larger in the first nine months of 2025 than in the same period in 2024.\n\n\"Tariffs are bringing in substantial revenue, but that revenue is largely offsetting other tax cuts done by the Trump administration,\" said Furman.\n\n\"Moreover,\" Furman added, \"A meaningful portion of the tariff revenue is coming from American consumers in the form of higher prices.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "fullText": "I was a single mom for seven years, and back then, the holidays were always a little financially challenging. I'm remarried now, but only working part-time. On only one full-time income, we've struggled to keep up with the higher cost of nearly everything, especially groceries.\n\nOur budget for the holidays this year will be smaller than we would like, so I'm resorting to some of the thrifty habits I developed as a single mom.\n\nThe trickiest thing on a near-nonexistent holiday budget was always figuring out how to get everyone a gift and make sure my son had enough to unwrap on Christmas morning. Now that he's 12, I think it's important that he sees what goes into giving gifts and is more involved in the process. He has always signed the Christmas cards we've given, but this year I'm going to have him help with some of the gift wrapping.\n\nThis year, he has also been helping me with a homemade ornament project as a gift for family members. To go with the ornament, I'll be making a few different kinds of cookies and designing platters to complete the gift. I know it's not as fancy as something I might be able to buy, but when it's coming from a close loved one, I think baked goods and homemade gifts can be even better.\n\nFor my husband and son, their stockings are going to be their main gifts this year. I love finding items that look vintage, as though they could have come from the North Pole. It takes a long time for them to go through their stockings and discover each treasure.\n\nI still buy a few larger gifts to put under the tree for each of them, but I do so with extreme deliberation, considering the price and whether it's good enough to be one of just three gifts.\n\nI never skimp on the decorations. I think the best part of Christmas is how the home feels once the decorations are out and the tree is up. We still buy a fresh tree every year, which isn't getting any cheaper to do, but I view it as my one splurge for the season. The ritual of going together as a family, picking out the tree, tying it to the top of the car, and driving home has become an important holiday tradition in its own right.\n\nEver since my son was small, we have also always gone out together and picked out one new ornament each for the tree. That way, our collection would grow over the years, and the ornaments would help us remember each Christmas that had passed. It's something my son loves doing, and it's still very affordable, so it's not worth skipping.\n\nWhen my son was young, I had to find ways to fill our schedule with festive activities that cost me little to no money. One of our favorite traditions has become driving around to look at Christmas lights and listening to Christmas music on the radio. We've brought hot cocoa in to-go cups with us before or gotten fast food treats as a special surprise. We also love having themed Christmas movie dinner nights. For example, we've ordered cheese pizza for Home Alone and eaten spaghetti during Elf.\n\nThese activities are what make the holidays feel special for us. I learned how to overcome the financial constraints of not having money for \"events\" and found ways to make Christmas still feel magical. This year, I'll continue to invest my time in holiday traditions like these, especially when my son is young and can still enjoy many of them.\n\nAfter I realized that Christmas is more about the activities leading up to it than the presents you get, I've stopped feeling bad about not having a lot of extra money during the holidays. I know it's ultimately going to be the memories we're making that my family will remember, not what's under the tree.",

    "fullText": "As AI displaces jobs, one of the \"godfathers of AI\" shared the career advice he'd give to his 4-year-old grandson to prepare him for the future.\n\n\"Work on the beautiful human being that you can become. I think that that part of ourselves will persist even if machines can do most of the jobs,\" research scientist Yoshua Bengio said on an episode of \"The Diary of a CEO\" podcast, hosted by Steven Bartlett, posted on December 18.\n\nDuring the one-hour and forty-minute episode, Bengio said that with companies eager to integrate AI into their workflows, it's only a matter of time before AI can do most jobs that humans do behind a keyboard. Physical jobs, like plumbing, may eventually be replaced by robots, too, although this may take longer, he said.\n\nBengio said that even as the world becomes more tech-driven, there will always be a need for human qualities such as love, accepting responsibility, and enjoying contributing to others' well-being.\n\n\"If I'm in a hospital, I want a human being to hold my hand while I'm anxious or in pain. The human touch is going to, I think, take more and more value, as the other skills become more and more automated,\" he said.\n\nAlongside Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun, Bengio is known as one of the \"godfathers of AI\" because of his pioneering research in deep learning and neural networks. He is a professor in the computer science and operations research department at the Université de Montréal, and in June, he launched the AI safety research nonprofit LawZero. In a statement on his website, Bengio said the organization aims to reduce dangerous behaviors associated with agentic AI systems, such as deception.\n\nAll three industry leaders have been sharing their advice for how people can pivot their careers to stay relevant in the age of AI.\n\nIn a June 2025 episode of \"Diary of a CEO,\" Hinton said it's a good time to become a plumber, as it may be a long time before AI disrupts physical jobs. Earlier this month, LeCun told Business Insider he thinks computer science students should focus on foundational courses, like maths and physics, rather than trendy courses on the technology of the day, if they want to break into AI.",

    "fullText": "Michael Burry says Nvidia is pushing the idea that building graphics chips that consume more and more power is the best path to advancing AI — and the result could be the US losing the AI race to China.\n\n\"Exactly and sadly,\" Burry wrote on X late Saturday, responding to another user's comment that called Nvidia the \"gangster of the AI neighborhood\" as it has \"shut down any narrative that even hints at reducing GPU demand.\"\n\nIn another post over the weekend, Burry shared a chart showing China has more than double America's electric generation capacity, and is expanding its energy infrastructure at a much faster rate.\n\nWhy China will win AI in one chart. \n\nPower hungry Nvidia chips are not the way forward for the U.S. \n\nIt is not just the total power advantage. It is the slope. pic.twitter.com/qNXh1e4lZj\n\nNvidia has framed AI innovation as \"just figuring out how to power and to cool bigger, hotter silicon,\" Burry said. But China's huge lead in building out power sources means companies in the US are \"plowing capital into a race it is structurally positioned to lose.\"\n\nBurry said the US needs to shift its focus from developing more and more \"power hungry\" chips toward advancing \"AI-tuned ASICs\" — application-specific integrated circuits that are designed to do a particular task quickly and efficiently.\n\nBut he said Nvidia has a \"death grip on development\" thanks to its deals with many key players in the AI industry.\n\nNvidia did not immediately reply to a request for comment from Business Insider about Burry's posts.\n\nNvidia stock has surged more than 12-fold since the start of 2023, making it the world's most valuable public company, with a market capitalization of $4.4 trillion.\n\nThe chipmaker raked in about $148 billion of revenue and $77 billion of net income in the first nine months of this year. \"Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in the third-quarter earnings release.\n\nBurry, whose contrarian bet against the US housing bubble was chronicled in the book and movie \"The Big Short,\" recently pivoted from running a hedge fund to writing on Substack.\n\nHe has made the case to his readers that Nvidia and other AI companies are inflating a historic tech bubble. He has said that Nvidia's customers have exaggerated the lifespan of its chips to drag out depreciation and boost short-term earnings.\n\nBurry has also called out the \"give-and-take\" deals between Nvidia and chip buyers such as OpenAI and Oracle, and criticized Nvidia's stock-based compensation as excessive.\n\nNvidia previously responded to his critiques in a memo to Wall Street analysts that was quickly leaked. Burry fired back that the document featured \"one straw man after another\" and he stood by his analysis.\n\nReplying to a subsequent comment on his Substack, Burry wrote that Nvidia had \"become too much of a focus.\" While the company's response did make him \"think to look a little deeper,\" he said it was a \"relatively small short\" for him.\n\n\"I believe it will fall, and is a pure play on my overall thesis, but it is not the worst out there.\"",

    "title": "8 things to get rid of in your home before the new year, according to professional organizers",
    "description": "From pet supplies to outdated clothing and toys, these are the things professional organizers suggest getting rid of before the new year.",
    "fullText": "The new year brings a fresh start, and decluttering your home is a great way to reset. This is easier said than done, but knowing where to focus your attention makes the tedious and time-consuming process more manageable.\n\nThat's why Business Insider asked two professional organizers what people should get rid of in their homes.\n\nLucy Wahl, founder of home organization company LMW Edits, recommends decluttering kids' toys as new ones enter the home during the holidays.\n\nAlthough she recommends taking care in your approach to getting rid of toys, she said the end of the year is an ideal time to do so, as the little ones will likely be enamored by all the new things they have to play with.\n\n\"You don't want to magically spirit away their stuff overnight, but old stuff is history because the kids are so excited about their new toys,\" Wahl said.\n\nThe end of the year is also a good time to purge the clothing that's taking up space in the closet. This can be especially important if you have growing kids.\n\n\"For families with kids, clothing that kids have outgrown from previous seasons, such as summer clothes and back-to-school outfits, is good to declutter,\" Wahl told BI.\n\nShe added that if you want to keep clothing for another child, doing so in an organized way is essential.\n\nFor many, decorating for the holidays is a fun way to transition into the season. However, holiday decor collections can quickly become clutter if you don't take the time to go through them.\n\nWahl recommends going through holiday decorations as you pull them out — or before you put them away.\n\n\"Instead of packing up all your decorations and then pulling them out next year and thinking, 'I don't want even half of this,' declutter your items while these thoughts are fresh in your mind,\" she said.\n\nOlivia Parks, owner of home organization company Nola Organizers, told BI that going through mail is one of the best things you can do before the new year.\n\n\"We receive mail almost daily, so piles of it quickly build up around the house. Part with any mail or paperwork you no longer want or need going into the new year to prevent future decluttering headaches,\" Parks said.\n\nWith holiday hosting in full swing, the end of the year is the perfect time to take stock of the kitchenware you used — and get rid of those that never left the cabinet.\n\nFor example, Wahl said it's a good time to ditch the pans or platters you keep for \"just in case\" moments.\n\nThe holidays are a popular time for new electronics to enter the home. But to keep things from getting cluttered, Parks suggests \"parting with electronics and devices that are no longer working for you.\"\n\nThis also includes things like accessories and cords, which can easily clutter drawers and closets.\n\nSports equipment can easily accumulate in basements and garages, especially when people hope to return to a once-loved hobby.\n\nHowever, Wahl said it's best to purge these items that are taking up extra space.\n\nIt's easy to accumulate and hold onto pet supplies that are no longer in use. That's why Parks recommends going through all toys, treats, and pet accessories as you head into the new year.\n\n\"Pets receive medications and treats that expire, and they outgrow old costumes and collars. It's the same with pets as it is with humans; don't forget to clean out their stuff,\" she said.",

    "title": "Taiwan's drone push needs its powerhouse industries, former US commerce official says",
    "description": "Taiwan has big plans for making more drones, but there are industry and economic hurdles to overcome, including getting more big businesses involved.",
    "fullText": "While still investing in traditional defense capabilities, Taiwan is also turning to drone technology to keep Beijing's forces at bay. To expand the sector, though, it needs to have its powerhouse industries fully engaged, a former US commerce official said recently.\n\nDrones — whether used for surveillance, disruption, or cheap precision strikes — are increasingly central to Taiwan's push for an asymmetric edge as China looms as an imposing threat. Taipei has watched how Ukraine has used drones for survivability and flexibility on the battlefield and now wants to field them at scale.\n\nAfter the US led its first major drone and counter-drone trade mission to Taiwan last fall, \"the country woke up to the opportunity\" that uncrewed systems represent for both defense and the economy, Betsy Shieh, a former senior commercial officer with the US Department of Commerce, said at a Hudson Institute event last week. \"They could see the trend lines, and Taiwan moved very, very quickly.\"\n\nTaiwan's government has strived in recent years to build up its drone industry. The defense ministry bought thousands of systems last year, with deliveries running through 2028, and this year rolled out a plan to buy tens of thousands more.\n\nTaiwan’s drone sector is being cultivated with strong government support, anchored by the state-affiliated National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology, which has partnerships with over 60 firms to accelerate development and production.\n\nTaiwanese manufacturers like Thunder Tiger have teamed with international partners on first-person-view (FPV) attack drones and other platforms. Key technological areas for the industry include artificial intelligence, autonomy, and concepts like drone swarming, which are focal points for both commercial innovation and Taiwan's defense strategy.\n\nShieh, who said she'd previously established conversations between Taipei and Washington about how to steer industry in the right direction, said during the panel that the next step is for Taiwan to get out of the way of business-to-business relationships. This would speed up the country's drone ambitions.\n\nNow, she said, Taipei needs to \"lay the foundation for those companies to really redirect their resources from current industries, such as space industry, semiconductor industry, electric vehicle industry, and into these new defense technologies, both because it's a huge economic opportunity but also to defend their own country.\"\n\nTaiwan’s government-backed national drone team pulls from a wide mix of companies, including established uncrewed systems manufacturers, firms like Thunder Tiger, Tron Future, and GEOSAT Aerospace & Technology.\n\nAdvanced technology firms such as Coretronic Intelligence Robotics Corp. and Mitac Advance Technology deliver additional expertise, while consumer-electronics firms and Taiwan’s powerful semiconductor sector are positioned to supply the technical, AI, and autonomy solutions that modern drones require.\n\nThose sectors are home to some of Taiwan's most dominant businesses. While Taiwan has brought dozens of companies into government-backed drone development efforts, many of the island’s flagship tech, semiconductor, and electronics firms remain only partially engaged. Getting the biggest power players to shift strategic resources, rework strategies, and invest heavily in drones may demand more state-level support.\n\n\"I think government assistance could be really, really helpful there,\" Shieh said.\n\nTaiwan's commerce and defense ministries did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider, nor did the National Chung-Shan Institute.\n\nA major hurdle for drone makers is securing approval that their systems contain no Chinese-made components — from sensors to antennas — and meet strict cybersecurity standards.\n\nBoth the US and Taiwan have banned obtaining parts from Chinese firms like DJI, a challenge given China's dominance of the global drone market. That's pushed Washington, Taipei, and other partners to work more closely to build alternative supply chains and stand up companies that aren't reliant on Beijing.\n\nThe cost of making and selling these drones without these parts is high, presenting another challenge.\n\nIn a Research Institute for Democracy, Society, and Emerging Technology think tank report earlier this year, analysts argued that while the drone sector nearly doubled in value from 2023 to 2024 and has seen a major surge in exports, \"high manufacturing costs driven by reliance on non-China components, limited domestic procurement beyond the MND [Ministry of National Defense]'s landmark 2024 order, and a scarcity of foreign government contracts impede further scaling.\"\n\nThe challenges come as Taiwan considers the role of drone technology in its defense plans for countering a potential Chinese invasion. Military exercises have increasingly included aerial drones and drone boats, and experts and officials have said these systems would be key assets in the event of a conflict.\n\nTaiwan, however, is still assessing the overall role of drones in its larger defense planning.\n\nA report from the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies published earlier this year said that drones give Taiwan a subtle way to counter China's increasingly aggressive grey zone tactics without sparking full-blown conflict. There is a risk, though, that some incursion or incident will lead to escalation.\n\nBeijing has already reacted to Taiwan's growing drone efforts — and its cooperation with the US — by expanding its own counter-drone training, \"including electronic warfare drills, swarm-jamming exercises, and targeting of UAV [uncrewed aerial vehicle] command centers,\" the report said. China has also sanctioned some US defense companies involved in supporting Taiwan's drone industry.",

    "description": "Nick Woolsey spent his 20s living in Japan. He figured it would be easier to raise his children back in the States, but now he's returning to Japan.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on conversations with Nick Woolsey, 39, who recently decided to move back to Japan after spending the last six years in the US. Woolsey, an American, is returning on a \"highly skilled professional visa\" after starting a company that helps people relocate to Japan. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI wasn't really thinking about permanent residency the first time I moved to Japan, because I was in my 20s and I didn't really have a plan. Now that I'm in my 30s — soon 40s — I feel like people in my age group need a plan.\n\nIn high school, I participated in a very short one-week exchange program with a sister city. Towns and cities in the United States and other places have corresponding cities in Japan, and most of the time, it's to facilitate junior high and high school exchanges.\n\nWhen I moved as a college student, I was going to college in Oregon, and they had a great sister school program with Tokyo International University. It was just a six-month exchange program, and then I went back to the US.\n\nAfter college, I did an MBA, and once I finished, I learned that there was a program for being a civil servant in Japan where you would facilitate exchange between your home country and Japan, work with nonprofits, and do translating.\n\nI felt like it was a good fit, so I applied and got in. But when I arrived in 2011, I was placed in a very little town, and they were like, \"Nonprofit government management? How about you just go teach English?\" And that's what I did.\n\nI was in Japan the second time around for about eight years. I was teaching for two years, and then I met the love of my life — another foreigner, she's Russian — and she was on a similar kind of work exchange program.\n\nShe got a job in Tokyo while we were dating, and she was like, \"Are you moving to Tokyo or not?\" I said sure, but I just renewed my contract with my teaching position, so she was there alone for almost a year. Then after that, I got a job and moved up to Tokyo and started working in tech.\n\nWe had our first child in Japan and we went from being completely free doing what we wanted, to caring for this little baby alone in the city. Both my wife's mom and my parents were really supportive, coming from both Russia and the States to help out when they could, but man, that was bigger than any culture shock I'd ever had.\n\nI was freaking out and I didn't have any time off from work to adjust to this new reality of having a baby. My wife was stuck home alone. It was a very stressful three months there at first, and we were like, \"Do we really want to raise this kid alone in Japan?\"\n\nThe other issue we had was that we were in the city, so it was very hard to get into day care. We didn't get in, but there were pros and cons to that because my wife got a great maternity leave — she got two years off.\n\nWe stayed for all of that, but in between, we thought about if we needed childcare help from my family. The answer was yes, absolutely, yes. And they weren't moving to Japan, so we had to move back to the States.\n\nWe moved back to my hometown, The Dalles, Oregon, in 2019, for not quite a year before things changed again.\n\nMy wife got a job offer at an international startup that had an office in the US, and they asked her to move to Silicon Valley, so we did, maybe six months before COVID. It was also a great financial decision for us to go back to the States because salaries in the US pay significantly more than in Japan.\n\nWe were making more money than we had ever made before. We both had jobs based out of Silicon Valley. But in Silicon Valley, we were basically just getting by, because our rent was like $5,000 a month. Preschool was about $3,000 a month, so that's $8,000 right there with just those expenses.\n\nMost of what we earned went right back out again. So it was then I was thinking, \"How could it be possible to have a Western pay, Western work-life balance, but have that quality of life and low cost of living in Japan?\"\n\nIn the States, recently with how inflation has been going, we would very rarely go out to eat. I went out to some food trucks with my four-person family — and one of them is only one year old, so she doesn't eat that much — but we had a couple beers, a hamburger, some meat on a stick, and it was $100.\n\nIn Japan, you could go as a family to a Michelin restaurant for $100. The scale is totally different, and the quality is totally different.\n\nI think what people don't realize is that not just Japanese food is good in Japan, all food in Japan is good — except Mexican.\n\nWe've got French, Italian, great hamburgers, pizza, fried chicken — so many different international cuisines.\n\nEverything that you stop by, even a little hole-in-the-wall is going to be really good. Whereas I felt, especially at those food trucks in the US, it's like mediocre Asian food, hamburgers, pizza, and tacos.\n\nWhat's available in suburbs in the States is limited and expensive, whereas in a small city in Japan, you've got lots of international choices.\n\nWe did what we could to control our costs. We left Silicon Valley and went to a small town in southern Washington, but costs just kept creeping up. And then there were changes with our jobs, too.\n\nMy company seemed like every six months it was going through some kind of layoffs, and I knew my turn was going to come at some point.\n\nThat was when I knew that I needed to use my other skills in life to develop a business. And, this is kind of a meta, but I made a business to teach people how to move to Japan on their own terms, because that's what I wanted to do.\n\nAs I was doing that, getting the website all set up and getting my first clients, I got the notice that it was my turn, and my job was going away.\n\nAnd then that summer, my wife and her company came to an agreement that their time together was also finished. We went from two incomes and a startup to just a startup. And that was the point where the golden handcuffs were off. We could do anything. We could go anywhere.\n\nWe had three choices: We could try to work remotely or get something locally in this small town where it's harder than ever to find remote work; we could get a job in DC, New York, Austin, or go back to Silicon Valley and probably go back to renting and commuting; or blow it up again and go back to Japan. So that's what we decided to do.\n\nI got my visa that I applied for, so I can be here for the next five years, but it's going to take a little time to transition.\n\nI've got a family of four and a house, so my first step is I'm here in Japan for a month getting together the apartment and all the paperwork for schools and stuff, and then going back and spending a couple of months to finish up prepping my family in the house back in the States.\n\nWhen I started the company, I knew that I wanted to move to Japan to retire someday — maybe 10 or 15 years out. I'd learn all the ins and outs of how to do it, coach people through it, and then do it myself. My timeline just got much accelerated.",

    "description": "Delete, do, delegate, or defer. Doesn't that sound easy?",
    "fullText": "Managing your inbox is a never-ending task, which is why we should seek to simplify it as much as possible. When emails pile up, you start overthinking what you need to do—I know I do, anyway. But if you pare down your options to the most basic and straightforward ones, it'll help ease your decision paralysis and keep you on top of things. That's what the \"four Ds,\" or the 4D method, does. It’s easy to remember and easy to implement, which makes it helpful for anyone who has a pile of emails to contend with every day. Here’s how to follow it.\n\nThis method of managing your overflowing inbox has been around quite a while and rests on quick decision-making to help you easily weed through it all. Time-tested, it works—but only if you get what you’re supposed to do.\n\n4D stands for, obviously, four “D” words:\n\nDelegate what the email wants you to do\n\nThose are easy to remember and, once you get the hang of calling them to mind, easy to do. Proponents of the method, like Aleksandra Brzeska, business development manager at XTRF Translation Management System, say this works as long as you adhere to it. Here’s how to put it in action.\n\n4D is similar to the one-touch rule. In fact, it relies on it, but takes it a step further. When using the one-touch rule, you make a decision about the email as soon as you open it up, but with that one, your focus is simply opening it the moment it comes in. For these techniques to work, you have to be opening every email, or at least looking at it and identifying from the subject line whether it’s worth opening. So, first things first, you’ll need to designate a time every day to sort through all your communications. Use timeboxing to block out time every morning, for example, to get this done. Make email management a core part of your daily to-do list when you use a method like the 3-3-3 list.\n\nWhen it’s time to go through your messages every day, set out to make a choice about each one, referring to the four options above. If it’s irrelevant, spam, or won’t ever require a follow-up, delete it. If it calls for a task that is doable right now, you’re responsible, and/or it’s pretty urgent, just do it. If it’s a less urgent task for someone else in your department or could be handled by another person without overloading them, delegate it and forward it their way. If it’s something that could or should be handled in the near future but doesn’t require immediate action, defer it by archiving it, putting it in a folder, or starring it.\n\nWhen this is done, go back through once more and archive or delete anything that’s now been done or delegated, clearing out your inbox for the next wave of messages. The benefit of using this method is that it makes decision-making simple, quick, and actionable, plus keeps your inbox low or close to zero. Removing unnecessary choices or procrastination streamlines the process and keeps you moving in just one of four ways, ensuring everything gets done or removed from your plate.",

    "description": "It's simple but effective: You need to open every email and move on as quickly as you can.",
    "fullText": "For as useful as emails are, they sure have a way of hampering productivity. Not only do endless emails bog you down and keep you stuck in a loop of endless replies, but the stress of even having to wade through both the important messages and the junk is enough to make you avoid your inbox altogether. There's a reason \"answer emails\" is always the example I use for a tedious-but-important task when I'm explaining more complicated, detailed productivity techniques.\n\nBut there are smaller techniques you can apply directly to email management, too. To stay on top of your work, school, and personal correspondence, you need a productivity plan, but it doesn't have to be intense: You can try the simple “touch” rules of inbox management.\n\nStart reframing how you think of every email you get and consider them each an immediate priority. Crucially, I only mean the email itself is a priority; if you think too hard about this, you'll get overwhelmed fast. You don’t have to do whatever task is outlined in it the moment it arrives, but you do have to open it. The “one-touch” rule is similar to the “two-minute” rule of productivity in that way: A task that takes less than two minutes to complete should be done right away.\n\nOpen the email, respond to it, and either delete or archive it, depending on if you’ll need it later. If it requires no response, even better. This method works best for people who get a lot of emails that aren’t necessary to respond to, like all-staff updates. The goal is to touch it once instead of coming back to it repeatedly and deliberating if and when you’ll respond or deal with it or instead of procrastinating, never opening it, and being unaware of its contents (or even existence) when you actually need to know what it said. Open it, take in the information, send feedback if necessary, and be done with it.\n\nIf you tend to have a lot of emails that need a response and the one-touch rule isn't working well, you can move on to a “two-touch” method to clear your mind and be more productive. On the first touch of the email, decide if you need to respond to it right away (making it one-touch) or it’s something that can or should be responded to later in the week.\n\nUse your email service’s flagging or snoozing functions to categorize it, so it is available to you easily when you’re ready to respond. Your first touch is still opening it right away—that’s key. Letting emails pile up is overwhelming, but opening them right away will help you maintain peace in your inbox. Designating a specific time to respond to non-urgent messages will also free you up to be more productive, as you’ll know you’ll get it done and won’t feel it weighing on you.\n\nMake sure you schedule time into your week to circle back on the flagged emails. Try building a 3-3-3 list to manage your to-dos, designating one of your three medium-sized or small tasks to opening all those saved messages.",

This is what we will all strive for again, to ensure that Celtic can be at the very top of the women's game.\"\n\nUnder Sadiku, Celtic qualified for the Champions League group stages for the very first time and lost narrowly to Chelsea before heavy defeats to Real Madrid.\n\nHowever, they struggled in the latter stages of the league season and finished a disappointing fourth as they tried to retain their crown, finishing 15 points behind eventual winners Hibs.\n\nCeltic are currently fourth in the SWPL table, seven points behind leaders Glasgow City. Scott leaves Hibs in fifth and six points adrift of his new side.\n\n\"Everyone at Celtic would like to thank Elena for her historic contribution during a hugely successful period,\" said Celtic chief executive Michael Nicholson.\n\n\"We are now pleased to welcome Grant Scott to Celtic as head coach of our women's team. Grant brings a strong track record in Scottish women's football, with proven experience of leading competitive teams and delivering success, most recently guiding Hibernian to their first league title in 18 years last season.\n\n\"We believe he is the right person to lead an important next phase of women's football at Celtic.\"\n\nSadiku added: \"To the Celtic fans, thank you for your support and always being there when we needed you. Home and away you were with us at every step, and the connection we built means a lot to me.\n\n\"Celtic will always be part of my journey, and I wish everyone at the Club every success in the future.\"",

    "description": "The Pittsburgh Pirates are looking to go free agency shopping.",
    "fullText": "The Pittsburgh Pirates are making some noise in the offseason and they could be a team to watch in free agency.\n\nThe BD staff got together and shared which player they want the Pirates to target in free agency.\n\nThe Pirates should sign third baseman Eugenio Suarez. After training for Brandon Lowe, the Pirates would be adding 80 home runs to their lineup. In 2025, the Pirates as a team hit 117. Suarez, 34, won’t command a significant contract for four to five years, but a three-year, $60 million deal could be enough to get Suarez to Pittsburgh. The Pirates need more offensive in their lineup and Suarez feels like a logical and perfect fit.\n\nOutfielder Harrison Bader declined his player option with the Phillies and is coming off of a season in which he hit .277 with 17 homers and 54 RBIs at a position of need for The Bucs. His options was for $10 million, so the Bucs will need to over that on a multi-year deal.\n\nFirst baseman Luis Arraez hit .292 with 8 homers and 62 RBIs and would immediately become one of Pittsburgh’s best hitters. He’s said to be seeking a multi-year worth $12 million per season. Doable for the Bucs.\n\nOf course someone like Alex Bregman or Cody Bellinger are fits anywhere, but the Bucs aren’t affording those guys. It’s likely more bargain hunting at the end of the day.\n\nThe player the pirates should target during free agency is designated hitter and first baseman Ryan O Hearn. He spent last season with the Orioles and the Padres. He had 17 HRs and 63 RBIs last season. O’Hearn isn’t this monster name in free agency but he is someone that would bring power to the batting lineup.\n\nOne of the most proven hitting prospects in this free-agent class is Kazuma Okamoto. With Murakami signing with Chicago, the Pirates are still in the running for his fellow countryman in Okamoto.\n\nOkamoto is entering his age-30 season and has proven mechanics at the plate. The Japanese veteran star would be a source of offensive consistency if he were to sign with Pittsburgh.\n\nThe Pirates are going to need a starting pitcher to replace Mike Burrows, who was traded to the Houston Astros in a three-team deal that netted the Bucs Brandon Lowe. A veteran arm that can eat up innings in the backend of the rotation would be ideal. Someone like Kenta Maeda or Tony Gonsolin could be a good fit as a low-risk, high-reward veteran that could be moved at the trade deadline for a prospect.",

    "description": "Week 16 reshaped the NFL playoff picture. Here is where things stand ahead of Colts-49ers",
    "fullText": "Week 16 saw several teams clinch playoff spots, and changed the pecking order in both the NFC and the AFC.\n\nIn the NFC, we have a new team in the No. 1 spot, and just two playoff spots left up for grabs as five teams have now clinched.\n\nIn the AFC, the race for the No. 1 spot remains tight, as six teams remain alive in the chase for the bye week.\n\nHere is the full state of play in the NFC ahead of Monday Night Football:\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles (10-5) – xy\n\nWashington Commanders (4-11) – e\n\nx – Team has clinched a playoff spot\ny – Team has clinched their division\ne – Team has been eliminated from playoff contention\n\nThanks to Sunday’s action, only two playoff spots are left up for grabs in the NFC.\n\nLet’s start at the top of the conference. Seattle’s huge overtime win over the Los Angeles Rams not only punched the Seahawks’ ticket for the playoffs, but it put them in the driver’s seat for the No. 1 seed in the conference. Seattle now controls their destiny in the chase for the top spot, as wins in their final two games (over Carolina and San Francisco) would give them the No. 1 seed.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles became the first team to clinch their division, as they wrapped up the NFC East with their win over the Washington Commanders on Saturday night. Philadelphia also became the first team to win the NFC East in back-to-back seasons since … the Eagles accomplished that feat back in 2004.\n\nSpeaking of the Panthers, Carolina moved into a playoff spot with their win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. If the postseason began today the Panthers would be in as the No. 4 seed. Tampa Bay’s loss dropped them out of the playoffs, and behind the Minnesota Vikings in the standings. The two teams have matching 7-8 records, but the Vikings have a better conference record.\n\nTampa Bay can still win the division, however, as they play Carolina in Week 18.\n\nChicago’s win over the Packers moved the Bears one step closer to an NFC North title, while putting Green Bay’s playoff chances onto shakier ground. Still, with the Lions losing to the Steelers on Sunday afternoon, the Packers still have some breathing room.\n\nChicago also clinched a playoff spot with the Lions’ loss, as did the 49ers.\n\nHere is what the NFC Wild Card matchups woulkd look like if the playoffs started today:\n\nNo. 7 Green Bay at No. 2 Chicago\n\nNo 6 San Francisco at No. 3 Philadelphia\n\nNo. 5 Los Angeles at No. 4 Carolina\n\nSeattle would have the No. 1 seed and the bye week.\n\nHere is the state of play in the AFC:\n\nNew England Patriots (12-3) – x\n\nLet’s start at the bottom of the playoff teams. Houston’s win over the Raiders gives the Texans a two-game lead over Indianapolis in the win column, ahead of the Colts’ game tonight against the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nThe Los Angeles Chargers and the Buffalo Bills have matching 11-4 records, but the Chargers have a better AFC record (8-2 vs. 8-3) than the Bills, so the Chargers slot into the No. 5 slot while the Bills settle for No. 6. Los Angeles has two more AFC games remaining (Houston and Denver) while the Bills just have the Jets remaining on their list of AFC opponents.\n\nDenver’s loss to Jacksonville, coupled with New England’s win over the Baltimore Ravens, tightened things at the top of the AFC as both teams have matching 12-3 records. The Broncos remain in the top spot due to a better record in common games (6-0 versus 4-1), and Denver has clinched that tiebreaker. However, in addition to the Patriots and Broncos, the Jaguars, Chargers, Bills, and Texans are all alive in the chase for the No. 1 pick.\n\nHere is what the AFC playoffs would look like if they began today, with Denver having the bye week:\n\nNo. 7 Houston at No. 2 New England\n\nNo. 6 Buffalo at No. 3 Jacksonville\n\nNo. 5 Los Angeles at No. 4 Pittsburgh\n\nThere are going to be some new fans around the league rooting for the 49ers tonight.\n\nFirst, let’s start with what this game means for the teams playing on Monday Night Football. The 49ers clinched a playoff spot when the Lions lost to the Steelers, and are now jockeying for position in the NFC pecking order. If the 49ers defeat the Colts, they will improve to 11-4, tying them with the Los Angeles Rams. But the 49ers would move into the No. 5 spot and drop the Rams down to the No. 6 spot, thanks to San Francisco’s better division record. San Francisco is 4-1 in NFC West games, while the Rams are 3-2.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Seahawks are 3-2 in NFC West games as well, and they play San Francisco in Week 18 having already lost to the 49ers back in Week 1.\n\nIf the 49ers lose, they will remain in the No. 6 slot.\n\nAs for the Colts, they enter Monday Night Football on the outside looking in. A win would not move Indianapolis into a playoff spot, but they would close to within one game of the Texans for the No. 7 spot.\n\nBut if the Colts lose, they will be eliminated from AFC South title contention, and they would drop two games behind the Texans in the race for a playoff spot with two games remaining.\n\nIn addition, if the Colts lose, the Chargers, Bills, and Jaguars all clinch playoff spots.",

First is that if he is a success, he is only on a two-year deal and can score bigger bucks in another negotiation. The flip is that if he is a bust, he can head back to Japan having made life changing money. It’s kind of a win-win for him.\n\nAidan Miller seems poised to make the leap the majors this year, but will his final destination be the shortstop he knows or a different position?\n\nThe Phillies have been top dog in the division for two years now, but is there another team gearing back up to take it from them?\n\nMunetaka Murakami has made a decision and it is to (shockingly) join the White Sox on a two-year deal worth $34 million.\n\nAnother big trade going down late last night as the Cardinals continued dumping players to Boston, this time Willson Contreras moving to Beantown.\n\nThe Pirates added a big bat in Brandon Lowe this weekend, but are still in the market to continue adding to their offense.\n\nAdd the Blue Jays to a growing list of teams that are interested in bringing Alex Bregman into their roster ($).

    "description": "The Times' sports reporting staff selects their favorite story from 2025, a showcase of stories that hold a special place with 17 writers.",
    "fullText": "There are no shortage of year-end lists that employ metrics — unique visitors, page views, minutes spent — to measure the most popular stories of the year.\n\nThe most enjoyable lists, however, are less quantifiable and divined instead by the writers themselves and what they have found most rewarding.\n\nThe following 17 Times staff writers and columnists, listed alphabetically, share their favorite sports stories from 2025.\n\nWhy these stories stuck with me: I actually have two stories from 2025 that I think rise a little above the daily noise, yet in a strange way they are related. The first is about baseball's one-hit wonders, players who played just one game in the major leagues but have seen that appearance shape the rest of their lives. The second is about former Dodger Mike Davis, who spent 10 years in the big leagues but has seen his career defined by one plate appearance, one which ended in the best-remembered walk in the team's history.\n\nWhy this story stuck with me: This story captured a sliver of the irreverent joy that Bill Walton brought to everyone he touched, including me.\n\nWhy this story stuck with me: Lizbeth Ovalle’s story is one of my favorites because this year she became the player with the highest transfer fee ever paid by a women’s soccer team. She is from Mexico, a country where women’s soccer still faces many disadvantages compared to the men’s league. Ovalle represents how women’s soccer is gaining relevance worldwide, even in places where support has been limited. Earlier in her career, at age 14, she endured 10-hour bus rides to train with the Mexican national team, receiving no pay beyond transportation. The Orlando Pride player recently won the 2025 FIFA Marta Award (FIFA Goal of the Year) for her stunning acrobatic goal, known as the “reverse scorpion kick,\" while playing in Liga MX with Tigres.\n\nWhy this story stuck with me: The fun of doing this story is talking to the 20-plus industry executives and experts to find out what would happen to racing nationally if California horse racing were to go away. The story received a lot of attention and even got some attention from NBC, the network that covers the Kentucky Derby. As a reporter, one of the fun challenges is to distill tens of thousands of interview words into a story that makes sense. So, thanks to the Times editors who allowed the story to be of magazine length.\n\nWhy this story stuck with me: In a rare visit to Reno, Nev., I spoke with Canelo Álvarez, who showed great pride as he reflected on two decades of building an extraordinary career — the resilience, the sacrifices and the legacy he hopes to leave behind. The piece also gave me rare insight through conversations with his brother Ricardo and his longtime trainer Eddy Reynoso, who shared intimate memories and moments that shaped him inside and outside the ring. Bringing all their voices together made the story feel personal, layered and special.\n\nWhy this story stuck with me: What I liked about this was Cooper Kupp, an iconic player and a cornerstone to the Rams rebuilding a fan base in Los Angeles, gave me an exclusive and insightful window into a difficult and painful segment of his life — his parting with the team. He hadn't opened up publicly before this, and I was pleased to have built that relationship and trust so that he was comfortable doing so with me.\n\nWhy this story stuck with me: The Dodgers' infusion of Japanese talent has been transformational to the franchise in many ways. But to Dave Roberts, it led to a particularly profound personal awakening, helping one of the most successful managers in MLB history reconnect with familial roots in a way that goes far beyond baseball.\n\nWhy these stories stuck with me: Covering the wrongful-death trial of former pitcher Tyler Skaggs vs. the Angels had elements similar to writing about ballgames: Describe what happened in the courtroom. Finding a story beyond trial testimony was difficult, but my Dec. 15 story predicting a settlement and explaining the secretive, outsized influence of the Angels' insurance companies met the challenge. Four days later the case settled while the jury was deliberating. My story on the rapidly unfolding events and reaction to the outcome ran on A1.\n\nWhy this column stuck with me: It’s unfortunate I had to write this. But our job as journalists is to chronicle what’s happening, and based on what many people told me after it was published, I’m glad I was able to put what they were feeling into words.\n\nWhy this story stuck with me: Of all the touted freshmen I’ve covered in my years on the college football beat, Jahkeem Stewart might be the most fascinating. Already a physical marvel as a sixth-grader, he took an unusual path to USC, having played in only a dozen high school games. This was a fun story to report, partly because it also came with great video of Stewart as a young football player, steamrolling pretty much everyone in his path.\n\nWhy these stories stuck with me: Stories are like children — all of them are your favorite. The opportunity to convey how athletes can positively influence and inspire others in their community is always rewarding. Speaking with fans and Polynesian athletes and coaches such as Jesse Sapolu, Norm Chow, Manti Te'o, Marcus Mariota and Jaylen Maiava provided a window into Puka Nacua's impact. And though young Rams defensive linemen and the famed “Fearsome Foursome” are separated by more than a half century, the respect and the homage the young players paid to Rosey Grier — the last living member of the Fearsome Foursome — and Deacon Jones, Merlin Olsen and Lamar Lundy — was heartwarming to report.\n\nWhy this story stuck with me: The most common question I got while covering the Chargers had nothing to do with Jim Harbaugh or Justin Herbert. Everyone wanted to know who was in charge of the social media accounts. Investigating weird, funny corners of the internet is my favorite way to remind myself (and hopefully others) that sports don't always have to be serious.\n\nWhy this column stuck with me: I chose “I’m Fighting Parkinson’s One Punch At A Time” because it was a story that took four years to write but one that has resonated immediately and endlessly.\n\nWhen I was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in the winter of 2021, I decided to keep the diagnosis a secret. Initially I didn’t even tell my own three children. I didn’t want people feeling sorry for me, or looking at me differently or, worse, treating me differently. I wanted to continue with my normal life while fighting the disease in private.\n\nAs part of this fight, I attended a boxing class for Parkinson’s patients. The class was filled with 80-year-old women pounding on a heavy bag, 75-year-old men dancing across the floor, elderly and trembling people working hard to stave off the effects of PD. They quickly became my heroes, and deserved to be illuminated as inspirations to others. I finally realized that I could tell their story and maybe push others to come out of the PD shadows and seek the same therapy.\n\nAnd, well, if I was going to write about others with Parkinson’s disease, I would have to come clean about myself. So, with help from boxing instructor Jody Hould and sports editor Iliana Limón Romero, I did. And I’m glad I did. I’ve since heard from countless people that the story moved them to admit their illness and begin boxing therapy or other types of PD workouts. My diagnosis was a punch in the gut. But thanks in part to the encouragement that came from this story, I’m fighting back.\n\nWhy this column stuck with me: The Dodgers did not much care for this story on how increasingly unaffordable Dodger Stadium has become for families. If we're so unaffordable, they said, how come we pack our stadium every night? It's a fair point: Ticket prices are a function of supply and demand, and demand for Dodgers tickets is driven by Shohei Ohtani and the Dodgers' dynasty. And the owners of the Dodgers, unlike the owners of too many other teams, put that money back into the team. Still, the Dodgers have a choice whether to maximize revenue or lower some prices so kids can come and the team can develop a new generation of fans. After the Dodgers hit a team-record 4 million in attendance last season and won baseball's first back-to-back championships in 25 years, the affordability challenge will only become more challenging next year.\n\nWhy this story stuck with me: In August was year No. 49 for me covering high school sports in Southern California, so on a beach in the summer, I wrote down some memories how it all started. Next fall will be a countdown of 50 best memories/stories for 50 years.\n\nWhy this story stuck with me: I enjoyed getting the backstory of this unusual mural. Some great photos by Juliana Yamada made the article look really good.\n\nWhy this story stuck with me: In one of the biggest and most shocking trades in NBA history, being the first to get this honest reaction from Anthony Davis about being traded to Dallas for Luka Doncic showed that building and maintaining relationships can pay off.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "While Viktor Gyokeres has not looked the panacea Arsenal hoped for since his transfer, Mikel Arteta has depth to call upon up front and it could be key to sealing the title",
    "fullText": "A striker Mikel Arteta had long coveted moved in the summer and scored in North London on Saturday in stylish fashion. Not for Arsenal, admittedly, and not on a day when Arsenal needed to rue the one who got away as his price got too big: Alexander Isak was injured a fraction of a second after unleashing the shot that nestled in the Tottenham net. The £125m man has just two league goals and faces another spell on the sidelines.\n\nAbout 90 minutes later, Arteta’s summer striking signing struck. Viktor Gyokeres, at £54m, came at less than half Isak’s fee and yet still looks overpriced. He has six Premier League goals, three times as many as Isak, but two were spot kicks and each may prove to be against a bottom-half finisher. Against Everton, he powered in his penalty but otherwise laboured and lumbered; there was no lack of effort but a distinct lack of class. The transfer-window online obsession with the Swede feels ever more misplaced.\n\nBut Arsenal may win the title: not in spite of him, nor because of him, but with him at times. And the task for Arteta, after heeding the fanbase’s demands to sign a striker, is to select the right ones. In 2026, he has a choice of four: the strikers he signed in 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025. Though, admittedly, at least one and arguably two did not arrive as a centre-forward. And there are times when they can seem the most compelling choices.\n\nThe fourth man, at times, the forgotten man, and, potentially, but for a cruciate ligament problem, the sold man is Gabriel Jesus. An Arsenal career that has been punctuated by injury and goal droughts will bring its 100th game on Tuesday.\n\nThe Brazilian is three cameos into a comeback. Perhaps it was symbolic that while he contributed to the winner against Wolves, it wasn’t his goal. Jesus only has seven in his last 42 appearances for Arsenal. Yet his half-hour against Everton highlighted his qualities, particularly, perhaps in comparison with Gyokeres. Jesus looked more on the same wavelength as his teammates, more capable of contributing to moves.\n\n“That’s probably the biggest quality of Gabi, bringing people together, connecting with people and generating a lot of uncertainty in the opponent,” said Arteta. “When you see him [at Everton], the amount of spaces that he was involved in, that's his biggest quality. So we need to exploit that.”\n\nIt was a reminder of the Jesus who Arsenal signed in 2022, the player who looked a catalyst immediately. He brought an uplift; but his best goal return in a campaign for the Gunners is 11 and Gyokeres’ return of 97 in two years at Sporting CP promised a more prolific touch, even if it now looks attributable to the shortcomings of the Portuguese league.\n\n“It’s been a really intense journey,” Arteta added. “I think when he joined us, I think he lifted the belief, the spirit and the energy of the club and the team. I think he gave something very different to what we already had, and it was really impressive.”\n\nNow Jesus is ready to start, his manager thinks. A Carabao Cup quarter-final against Crystal Palace could be an opportune occasion: five of his last six goals came against Oliver Glasner’s team, including a League Cup hat-trick.\n\nA successful return could give Arteta a dilemma. So could another. Kai Havertz has only played half an hour this season.\n\nIt may be impossible to prove but the theory persists that, but for injury, he would started many of the tougher tests earlier in the season: Liverpool, Manchester City, Newcastle away. Gyokeres had little impact on such stages.\n\nIn Havertz’s extended absence, Mikel Merino offered a reminder of his credentials as a stand-in striker. In particular, as an excellent goalscorer, his aerial ability, finishing prowess and capacity to sniff out an opening making him more than a makeshift choice. Some might deem him preferable to Gyokeres but Arsenal have an imperative to try and make the Swede succeed.\n\nYet there are bigger objectives, with a title at stake. The Arteta model has been to amass the most complete squad; to cover for all eventualities. It means there are automatic choices in some positions, but not all. He has never been able to select from his four striking choices. He will soon.\n\nIf Jesus had seemed a distant fourth in others’ thinking, he has been both Brazil and Manchester City’s No 9. Merino may be the best finisher of the four, Havertz the most complete player. Then there is Gyokeres, whose summer arrival indicated he would be the regular, but could be found someway down the queue. The chances are that Arteta may prefer Havertz for the biggest of matches. The challenge for him, though, will be to pick the right one on each occasion.",

    "title": "Michigan Football Head Coaching Hot Board (Week of Dec. 22)",
    "description": "The search for the Wolverines’ head coach continues. Here is our Michigan Football Head Coaching Hot Board for the week of December 22nd:",
    "fullText": "The Michigan Wolverines’ search for a new head coach enters a second week, as their Plan A guys didn’t exactly work out over the weekend. Kalen DeBoer and his Alabama Crimson Tide team upset Oklahoma on the road in the first round of the College Football Playoff on Friday, while Kenny Dillingham signed a new contract with Arizona State on Saturday.\n\nAfter those punches to the gut, here is our latest Hot Board. As mentioned last week, this is not the entire list of all the candidates Michigan is considering, but merely what we have seen, heard and reported on, as well as some guys Michigan should at least give it a shot with.\n\nYup, this is where we’re at now, folks. Jeff Brohm is now at the top of the list for the Wolverines.\n\nLet’s start with the positive — he is an offensive mind that has turned guys like David Blough and Aidan O’Connell into serviceable college quarterbacks and guys that eventually made it to the NFL. The thought of pairing him up with Bryce Underwood is exciting and would very likely take him to the next level.\n\nAnd that’s about where the positives end for me. Now, the not-so-positives — Brohm’s never had elite defenses, which is obviously something Michigan has prioritized having over the last several years. The Cardinals had the No. 64 total defense last year before rebounding and putting together the No. 15 total defense this season. It’s improvement, but is it a one-hit wonder because the ACC was hot garbage in 2025, or is it actually sustainable?\n\nBrohm is also reportedly challenging to work with, as a Louisville source told Sam Webb ($) he was described as “difficult,” and his family as “a problem.” Brian Brohm, Jeff’s brother, is the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at Louisville, while his other brother, Greg, is the chief of staff. Both of them worked with Jeff at Purdue, so it’s clear he would bring his brothers to Ann Arbor with him.\n\nThe cherry on top is Brohm has never had a season as a Power 4 head coach where he’s lost less than four games. That includes this year, where the Cardinals started off hot by winning seven of their first eight games, only to implode and lose three of their final four games, including horrifically bad losses at home to Clemson and Cal.\n\nFor Brohm to be the guy at the top of the list at this point is majorly disappointing. I think he would be a fantastic offensive coordinator at a school like Michigan, but for him to be considered for this role…what are we doing, Warde?\n\nJesse Minter has obvious ties to the university, serving as the defensive coordinator during Michigan’s run to a national title in 2023. He’s also widely viewed as a head coach in the waiting whenever his stint as defensive coordinator of the Los Angeles Chargers ends.\n\nBut will that be in college or in the NFL? If I had to guess, it would likely be the latter. However, he should absolutely be someone the Wolverines make a phone call to just to get a temperature check. He is an elite defensive mind that was great on the recruiting trail over his two years in Ann Arbor.\n\nThe AP reported over a week ago that Michigan’s search firm has been in contact with representatives of Missouri head coach Eli Drinkwitz. The 42-year-old just signed a six-year contract extension with the Tigers back in November and has never coached, nor resided in Big Ten country. It seems unlikely, but with options dwindling, maybe the Wolverines should consider Drinkwitz a bit more seriously moving forward.\n\nAfter more than 20 years as the head coach of Utah, Kyle Whittingham stepped down just a couple weeks ago and declared himself “in the transfer portal” in search of his next job. He has a career 177-88 head coaching record (all at Utah) and won two conference championships when Utah was still a member of the Pac-12.\n\nA downside to Whittingham is he has never been this far east of the Mississippi in his career — he grew up in California, went to college at BYU, and has coached his entire career in either Utah or Idaho. Would he be able to adapt to the midwest culture and recruit at a high level? Considering his high level of character, it wouldn’t surprise me if he would be able to do so, but it’s a major question mark on his resume for a school like Michigan.\n\nAnother major question mark is how much he has left in the tank. He’s 66 years old and by no means has to coach anymore. He could retire and live the rest of his life in paradise. If he got hired and things weren’t going well, would he leave Michigan before his contract was up for an early retirement? That’s something I would need reassurance on before potentially hiring him.\n\nAnother unlikely option, in my opinion, but Clark Lea needs to be discussed more now that Dillingham and DeBoer are out of the running. One of my colleague Nick Durand’s favorite candidates, Lea has turned around his alma mater Vanderbilt and led the Commodores to a 10-2 record this season and just on the outside of the College Football Playoff. He also played a large role in flipping five-star quarterback Jared Curtis from Georgia right before National Signing Day a couple weeks ago, so he’s got some recruiting chops as well.\n\nThe issue here is that Lea signed a six-year contract extension with Vanderbilt last month, so buying him out of the contract may be tricky. Again, this is a very unlikely option, but if Michigan is serious in opening up the checkbook for the best candidate, Lea would be a pretty decent coach to do that for.\n\nBefore I begin with this group of coaches, I remain in the camp of not necessarily *wanting* Michigan to hire someone with no head coaching experience. However, if Michigan does go this route, these are the two I would be okay with.\n\nStarting with Glenn Schumann, a young up-and-coming coach who has been in the SEC his entire coaching career. The 35-year-old Schumann started off as a grad assistant at Alabama, his alma mater, before getting hired by Kirby Smart to lead Georgia’s inside linebackers in 2016. He was promoted to co-defensive coordinator in 2019, and interviewed for the Philadelphia Eagles’ defensive coordinator opening in 2023 before staying put at Georgia and becoming its lone defensive coordinator in 2024.\n\nSchumann also has leadership experience off the field. He was Alabama’s director of football operations from 2014-15, where he dealt with team travel, logistics, day-to-day operations, recruiting and other off-field assignments.\n\nThere’s a lot to like about Schumann, but the obvious caveats are he has no head coaching experience and is a life-long resident of the south. How would he do in a new environment like Michigan? And would he be able to recruit the midwest? These are obvious questions that would need to be answered before a potential hire.\n\nAdam Stenavich has worked his way up the coaching ranks since leaving Ann Arbor as an offensive lineman in 2006. He was a graduate assistant at Michigan for two years before taking the offensive line coaching gig at Northern Arizona. He also was an offensive line coach at San Jose State before jumping to the NFL, where he has been since 2017. Stenavich has been with the Packers since 2019 and was promoted to his current role in 2022.\n\nThe obvious caveat here — other than the lack of head coaching experience — is that the Packers are likely to be in the playoffs since season, which will run through January. This is not great timing due to the transfer portal opening up on Jan. 2. However, as Sam Webb ($) pointed out, head coach Matt LaFleur calls the plays in Green Bay, so it wouldn’t be a major problem for Green Bay if Stenavich left his current role early.\n\nIt still seems unlikely to me that Stenavich (or anyone) would want to leave early in the midst of a run to the Super Bowl, but it’s an interesting thought nonetheless.\n\nI had this same section here last week and I will keep it here this week, especially with DeBoer and Dillingham officially off the board.\n\nLook, you’re Michigan. On College Game Day last week, Nick Saban called you a top-five job in all of college football. If you are so high and mighty and want to be the “Leaders and Best,” you should be going after the elites in the sport. Especially Marcus Freeman, who has been sitting on his couch the last couple weeks after the Irish opted out of bowl season.\n\nWarde — do your job, or someone else should be doing it for you.",

There have been various confirmations from various outlets since then, Now, we can say that the Giallorossi will attempt to get to the heart of the matter as quickly as possible so that they can provide Gian Piero Gasperini with his first reinforcement of the January transfer window.\n\nAtletico Madrid have opened up to the deal. Raspadori’s minutes in Spain are rapidly decreasing: Only one start in LaLiga so far this season, and only a trivial seven-minute cameo over the weekend.\n\nGETAFE, SPAIN – NOVEMBER 23: Giacomo Raspadori of Atletico de Madrid celebrates his team’s first goal which was an own goal scored by Domingos Duarte of Getafe CF (not pictured) during the LaLiga EA Sports match between Getafe CF and Atletico de Madrid at Coliseum Alfonso Perez on November 23, 2025 in Getafe, Spain. (Photo by Florencia Tan Jun/Getty Images)\n\nRoma will hold discussions over a loan deal with a potential option to buy, which could potentially become an obligation to buy.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Roma will be able to pull off a deal in early January, but this is certainly a situation to monitor.\n\nAs we confirmed last week, there could potentially be a double-attacking signing for Roma in January.\n\nNOTTINGHAM, ENGLAND – APRIL 01: Joshua Zirkzee of Manchester United looks on as he walks out of the tunnel to inspect the pitch prior to during the Premier League match between Nottingham Forest FC and Manchester United FC at City Ground on April 01, 2025 in Nottingham, England.

    "description": "The Patriots wide receiver had his fourth 100-yard game of the season on Sunday.",
    "fullText": "It took just three plays for the Patriots to get Stefon Diggs involved Sunday night in Baltimore.\n\nWith Diggs streaking across the middle of the field, Drake Maye hit him in stride and the receiver hauled in a 25-yard catch through contact. A hard fall, however, led to the receiver flexing his shoulder and being pulled off the field for a trip to the blue medical tent.\n\nShortly after, NBC’s Melissa Starks reported that Diggs had to be “physically restrained” in the blue tent before he “escaped out the back.”\n\n“I was blacking out, bro,” Diggs explained after the game. “They were holding me in the tent. They said I had a concussion, but I never touched my head, I never laid on the ground. They monitored me for a concussion. I said, ‘I never had a concussion.’ I was touching my shoulder, so how would y’all say I had a concussion?”\n\n“I was fighting with them to get back out there. It’s the first drive. I’m wired to get back out there to make plays for my team. We had a little stall, so I was like, ‘Damn, I’m supposed to be out there.’ Parts of me feel like I let the team down if I’m not out there. I apologized to them afterwards, but you can’t stop me from being on that field.”\n\nAfter passing a concussion test and returning to the field, Diggs made his presence felt in New England’s 28-24 victory. Diggs hauled in a game-high nine passes for 138 yards — including a 21-yard fourth-down catch-and-run on the go-ahead touchdown drive — to eclipse the century mark for the fourth time this season.\n\nThree of those games have come in prime time.\n\n“Prime time, my time,” Diggs said. “The world is watching and I always look at it as another opportunity to show the world who I am, and how I’m coming.”\n\nIn addition to marching the Patriots offense up the fields, Diggs was seen marching up the New England sideline in the second-half encouraging his teammates as they were trailing.\n\nThe veteran’s leadership has made an immediate impact in New England’s locker room, while he is now just 131 receiving yards away on the field to be the first Patriots wide receiver to eclipse the 1,000-yard mark since 2019.\n\n“Diggs, people have no idea what he means to this team,” Maye said. “He’s a leader. He’s been great in the locker room. He wants the football in his hand.”",

    "description": "A look at the NFC playoff picture and the Detroit Lions’ dwindling postseason odds and clinching scenarios.",
    "fullText": "With a devastating loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Detroit Lions have dropped to 8-7 on the season, and their playoff hopes are about as realistic as Calvin Johnson coming out of retirement. Here’s a look at what the playoff picture looks like, the Lions’ remaining playoff scenarios, and where the rest of the division and conference looks like.\n\nThe Lions can no longer win the NFC North, and the Bears are just a single win away from clinching their first division title since 2018. It’s a tough pill to swallow for Lions fans, as it appears Ben Johnson was the perfect hire for the Bears.\n\nThe Lions are actually in danger of falling into fourth place in the NFC North, and a loss to the Vikings on Christmas would nearly seal it. Both teams would be 8-8, the Vikings would finish with a season sweep of the Lions, and Detroit would finish the season with a tough matchup against a Bears team that may be still looking to clinch the division.\n\nOf course, maybe it would be a blessing in disguise for the Lions to finish last in the division so that they could play a fourth-place schedule next year (which would like feature games against the Giants, Titans, and Cardinals).\n\nWild Card race (top three advance)\n\nThe Lions’ best potential record is 10-7, meaning they can only mathematically catch the 49ers and Packers. But because the 49ers have locked in the tiebreaker over the Lions due to their conference record (8-2 vs. 5-5), the Packers are the only team Detroit can actually catch.\n\nObviously that would require the Lions to win both of their remaining games (at Vikings, at Bears), but the Packers would also have to lose out. Green Bay has the 7-8 Baltimore Ravens this upcoming week, who lost Lamar Jackson to a back injury on Sunday night. And they finish out with the Vikings, who lost J.J. McCarthy to a throwing hand injury on Sunday. Even though the Packers are struggling and have a bunch of injuries of their own, that seems very unlikely to happen.\n\nThe New York Times only gives the Lions a 6% chance to make the playoffs. NextGenStats has Detroit at 8%.",

    "title": "Shaikin: Should Angels fans just give up and join the Dodgers bandwagon?",
    "description": "With all the issues the Angels are facing amid a long playoff drought, should their fans abandon the team and root for the Dodgers or some other team?",
    "fullText": "Christmas is three days away, and you’re running out of time to get a gift for the Angels fan in your life. How about a Dodgers cap?\n\nIf ever a winter posed a loyalty test, this one could. The Dodgers spent $69 million on Edwin Díaz, the best closer available in free agency, and another $2 million in championship parade costs. The Angels spent $2 million on a closer who put up an 8.23 earned-run average last season.\n\nNext year the Dodgers will try to become the first National League team to win three consecutive World Series. The Angels will try to end baseball's longest postseason drought at 11 years, still without much of a plan beyond rushing first-round draft picks to the major leagues while treading the financial waters until Anthony Rendon’s contract runs out.\n\nOn Sunday they missed out on Japanese slugger Munetaka Murakami, who signed with the 102-loss Chicago White Sox. Of the Angels’ five acquisitions this winter, three did not play in the majors last season, and not because they are up-and-coming prospects.\n\nIf you’re an Angels fan and you’re sick and tired of this, should you reconsider your loyalty?\n\nJim Bowden believes you should.\n\nBowden, formerly the general manager of the Cincinnati Reds and Washington Nationals, serves as a baseball insider on several media platforms. On “Foul Territory” last week he suggested fans of small-market teams have an option that might be more constructive than getting angry.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, for instance, the owner would rather complain about the lack of a salary cap than spend enough money to build a winner around generational pitcher Paul Skenes.\n\n“You don’t have to be a Pirate fan,” Bowden said. “You can retire as a Pirate fan, or trade yourself to the Dodgers.\n\n“If you want to see your team win, right now the Dodgers have got the best chance to win a World Series again. As a fan, you can root for any team you want.\n\n“You don’t have to root for the team in your home city. You can see the Dodgers play in your home city. They’ll come into Pittsburgh and beat you.\n\n“If it bothers you that much, just become a Dodger fan. It’s fine.”\n\nThe Angels no longer operate as a large-market team, and their circumstances could get even more dire in the near future.\n\nOn Sunday, Sports Business Journal reported that the parent company of FanDuel Sports Network is in jeopardy of shutting down if it cannot complete a sale to streaming service DAZN. The Angels would not disappear from your screens and streams, but it likely would mean the Angels would take a big cut in local broadcast revenue for a second consecutive year.\n\nThe Dodgers’ bandwagon shows no sign of slowing. The Dodgers set a franchise attendance record last season. They offer stadium tours in English, Spanish and Japanese. They launched a fan club in Japan.\n\nSo, as a frustrated Angels fan, you could hop on that bandwagon. Or you could try another large-market team — say, the New York Mets.\n\nMets owner Steve Cohen is worth $23 billion, according to Forbes. When Cohen bought the Mets in 2020, he said this: “If I don’t win a World Series in the next three to five years — I’d like to make it sooner — I would consider that slightly disappointing.”\n\nThe Mets still have not won a World Series since 1986. On Friday he took to social media to criticize “the usual idiots misinterpreting a Post article on Mets payroll.”\n\nOn Sunday, given the Mets’ losses of Díaz and beloved slugger Pete Alonso in free agency, New York Post columnist Mike Vaccaro shot back, comparing Cohen to greatly unloved former owner Fred Wilpon in this adaptation of a Christmas carol: “Steve’s beginning to look a lot like Wilpon/Mets fans say ‘Hell, no!’/What’s the point in being so rich/And a ruthless sonofabitch/If you don’t spend dough?”\n\nThe concept of fan free agency — essentially what Bowden suggested — is not new. Every now and then some disgruntled fan will publicly disown his favorite team, then invite rival teams to suggest why he should support them. If you’re creative enough, rival teams will send you some free swag.\n\nThat level of desperation is what many Dodgers fans felt a decade and a half ago, when former owner Frank McCourt needed a loan to cover payroll, hired a Russian physicist who channeled positive energy toward the team and “diagnosed the disconnects” among baseball operations personnel, and disparaged as “un-American” the league’s refusal to approve a television contract that he said would have provided the revenue to keep the Dodgers out of bankruptcy court.\n\nIn 2011, the year McCourt took the team into bankruptcy, the Angels outdrew the Dodgers for the only time. The Dodgers fans did not bail on their team. They waited for better days.\n\nThat is where Angels fans are now — and, for that matter, where Pirates fans are too. Bowden’s suggestion that unhappy Pirates fans exhausted by the perennial futility try the Dodgers did not go over well in Pittsburgh. At the Pirates’ fan site Rum Bunter, Emma Lingan wrote: “Fandom isn’t a streaming subscription you cancel when the content gets bad.”\n\nThis year’s World Series was the best and most dramatic I ever covered. But the one that was the most fun was the 2002 World Series: the underdog Angels, the Disney team no one projected for a happy ending, rampaging through October and toppling giants. As The Times’ headline on the Game 7 victory put it: “Fantasyland!”\n\nIf you were there in 1982 and 1986, when the Angels had six chances to win one game to clinch their first World Series appearance — and lost all six — then you could have a greater appreciation of 2002. And, if you were there for McCourt bankruptcy, you can have a greater appreciation of Guggenheim majesty.\n\nSo get that Angels fan in your life an Angels cap. That fan will be able to wear that cap proudly one of these years, and all the tears will make the cap fit that much more snugly.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "When is Mohamed Salah back from AFCON? Egypt schedule, Liverpool return date after 2025 Africa Cup of Nations originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nGiven the recent strain in relationship between player and club, Mohamed Salah's time as a Liverpool player looks to be coming to an end.\n\nIn fact, it's even possible he has played his final game as a Red. Having departed for international duty with Egypt at the Africa Cup of Nations, Salah could now be nearing an acrimonious end to his illustrious time at Anfield.\n\nYet there's also the potential that Salah returns to the club following the conclusion of Egypt's journey through AFCON, ready to help press on towards the latter stages of the 2025/26 season.\n\nThe Sporting News brings you a full overview of when Salah could potentially make his way back to Merseyside, when his matches with Egypt will be, and what games Salah would miss thanks to international duty.\n\nMORE:Egypt top Nigeria in pre-AFCON friendly with Salah on the bench\n\nThe 2025 Africa Cup of Nations will begin on December 21, contested for a month all the way up until the final on January 18.\n\nOriginally scheduled for this past June and July, AFCON was pushed back to the winter due to the 2025 Club World Cup scheduled for action in the United States over the same time.\n\nAll players will return to their clubs from Africa Cup of Nations duty once their team is eliminated from the competition, unless injury or other exception sees them depart early.\n\nEgypt are one of the contenders for the title, and therefore it's likely that Salah will return to Liverpool later in the competition.\n\nThe earliest Salah or any player could be back with their club would be the end of the group stage on December 31. However, thanks to Egypt's status as a true contender in the competition alongside their soft group-stage draw, this is highly unlikely.\n\nMORE:Complete group tables and schedule for AFCON 2025\n\nShould Egypt top their group, they would likely progress to at least the quarterfinals on January 9. It's even possible that the Pharaohs advance through to the semifinals or beyond, which would see Salah return in mid-January.\n\nWith Salah, there is also the distinct possibility that he is sold in the January transfer window, potentially meaning he would not return to the club at all should a deal progress prior to the end of the AFCON tournament.\n\nEgypt were drawn into Group B at AFCON 2025, facing South Africa, Angola, and Zimbabwe. Finishing top two in the group sees them qualify directly for the knockout stage, while they can also potentially qualify with a third-place finish if they are one of the best four sides to come third across the groups.\n\nWinning the group places them in the top half of the bracket against a third-place qualifier, while a second-place finish in Group B would see them enter in the bottom half against the runner-up in Group F (Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Gabon, Mozambique).\n\nIncredibly, the schedule has shaken out favorably for Egypt such that winning Group B would see them play every match in the same venue, Adrar Stadium in Agadir, until the semifinals.\n\nThere are two different potential places that Egypt could end up in if finishing third in their group, one on either side of the bracket. One sees them play the winner of Group D in the Round of 16, while the other sees them meet the winner of Group C.\n\nAdrar Stadium (Agadir, Morocco)\n\nAdrar Stadium (Agadir, Morocco)\n\nAdrar Stadium (Agadir, Morocco)\n\nRound of 16 vs. 3rd place A/C/D\n\nAdrar Satdium (Agadir, Morocco)\n\nQuarterfinals vs. TBD (1st Group F vs. 2nd Group E)\n\nAdrar Stadium (Agadir, Morocco)\n\nTangier Grand Stadium (Tangier, Morocco)\n\nPrince Moulay Abdellah Stadium (Rabat, Morocco)\n\nAl Medina Stadium (Rabat, Morocco)\n\nQuarterfinals vs. TBD (1st Group A vs. 3rd place C/D/E)\n\nPrince Moulay Abdellah Stadium (Rabat, Morocco)\n\nPrince Moulay Abdellah Stadium (Rabat, Morocco)\n\nPrince Moulay Abdellah Stadium (Rabat, Morocco)\n\nSalah will miss a considerable chunk of time as Liverpool push through multiple competitions.\n\nThankfully for the Reds, the Champions League takes a break for the winter holidays much like other domestic competitions around Europe and the rest of the world. However, the Premier League keeps on trucking through the winter unabated, and therefore he will miss a number of big domestic matches.\n\nSalah is guaranteed to miss at least three league matches. He would return for potential participation in the trip to Fulham on January 4 should Egypt be stunned by group-stage elimination, but in all likelihood he would miss that game and potentially the important clash with title contenders Arsenal on January 8.\n\nA push to the later stages of AFCON could see Salah miss even more games, and depending on the rest he is given after the competition he could even be absent from the return to Champions League play on January 21 in France against Marseille.\n\nMatches Salah is guaranteed to miss\n\nMatches Salah could potentially miss",

    "description": "Trevor Lawrence, Sam Darnold, and Blake Corum highlight the top waiver wire targets entering Week 17.",
    "fullText": "Hello! Happy holidays and welcome to the Week 17 waiver wire watch!\n\nThis is the end of the line. Championship week is here for most fantasy leagues and whether you’re gunning for the title or trying to avoid the humiliation of finishing last, your fantasy season comes down to one final matchup. We still have the Monday night showdown between the 49ers and Colts to get to this evening, but it’s not too early to start looking for ways to fortify your rosters for the grand finale.\n\nWe’ll go over some performers that you should consider scooping off the waiver wire ahead of Week 17 and as always, we’ll classify a waiver add as someone who is rostered in 60% of leagues at the max. There are three games set for Christmas on Thursday and two games set for Saturday, so make sure to get your lineups situated early this week.\n\nThe Jaguars are arguably the hottest team in the NFL right now and they picked up their sixth straight victory in a huge 34-20 road triumph over the Broncos. It took a while, but Lawrence is finally looking like the franchise QB that was drafted No. 1 overall as he put 279 passing yards and four total touchdowns on a Broncos defense that had only allowed 30+ points once prior to Sunday.\n\nThis was an excellent follow-up to his five-touchdown performance against the Jets the week prior and he now has 12 passing touchdowns to zero picks over his last four games. We’ve seen some impressive stuff from the QB as the team is not only nearing the AFC South title, but is now in the mix for the No. 1 seed in the conference. If you need a QB off the wire to lift you over the top in this final week, then Lawrence is your guy.\n\nWeek 17 matchup: @ Indianapolis Colts, 1 p.m. ET\n\nDarnold came out on the winning side of what could be the game of the year in the NFL, as a successful two-point conversion strike to Eric Saubert in overtime lifted the Seahawks over the Rams in a 38-37 thriller. Things looked bleak for the team late as they were staring down a 16-point deficit with less than 10 minutes to go. However, a punt return touchdown, a defensive stop, and a 26-yard strike to AJ Barner allowed them to tie the game just mere minutes later. After L.A. put a TD on the board to start OT, Darnold marched the Seahawks down the field, found Jaxon Smith-Njigba for a touchdown, and delivered the dagger with the successful two-pointer to put Seattle on top of the NFC West standings.\n\nHe racked up 21.5 fantasy points with 270 passing yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions, finishing the week as a top-10 fantasy QB for the fifth time this season. The Seahawks have business to handle with an inside track to the No. 1 seed in the NFC, so he may be dialed in for Sunday’s showdown against the Panthers.\n\nWeek 17 matchup: @ Carolina Panthers, 1 p.m. ET\n\nThe Rams came out on the losing end of a game-of-the-year contender last Thursday, falling 39-38 to the Seahawks in an overtime loss that cost them their NFC West lead. They at least continue to get good production out of Corum, who took 14 carries for 48 rushing yards and a one-yard touchdown that extended the Rams’ lead in the third quarter.\n\nThat’s now five touchdowns in the last five games for the second-year back from Michigan as he’s been Mr. Reliable for the offense in multiple facets, especially the red zone. There’s a lot of potential upside for a guy who is always a threat to score.\n\nWeek 17 matchup: @ Atlanta Falcons, 8:15 p.m. ET (Monday night)\n\nLook, was the Titans’ 26-9 victory over the Chiefs a result of KC’s season going down in flames with Gardner Minshew tearing his ACL just one week after Patrick Mahomes? Absolutely, but you get it however you can get it and Tennessee put together one its most productive days on offense this season. Spears played his part in that performance, registering 52 rushing yards, 53 receiving yards, and punched in a fourth-quarter touchdown that put them up by two scores.\n\nIt was a nice effort for Spears, who hadn’t scored a touchdown since their road loss to the Colts back in late October. They may want to give him some extra touches after the day he had this week, so this may be the perfect time to stream him.\n\nWeek 17 matchup: vs. New Orleans Saints, 1 p.m. ET\n\nTrevor Lawrence has been in sync with his receiver core for the past month and Washington ended up being his favorite target in the Jaguars’ 34-20 statement victory over the Broncos on Sunday. The third-year wideout was a fireworks factory at Mile High Stadium, posting a career-day by catching six of 10 targets for 145 receiving yards and a first-quarter touchdown that opened the scoring festivities for Jacksonville.\n\nHe exited Sunday as a top-three fantasy wideout in all scoring formats for the week and that’s a testament to the role that he’s played in the Jags offense in recent weeks. Momentum is on their side right now and if you need a skill guy to get you over the hump in the final week, then a Jags receiver like Washington would be a solid choice.\n\nWeek 17 matchup: @ Indianapolis Colts, 1 p.m. ET\n\nJohnston had his most productive game of the season on Sunday as the Chargers moved a step closer to clinching a playoff spot in their 34-17 victory over the Cowboys. The third-year wideout from TCU was hitting home runs with each catch, turning four receptions into 104 receiving yards including a first-quarter touchdown reception that put them on the board.\n\nJohnston has been relatively quiet in the second half of the season after storming out the gate with a strong start in the first month of the campaign. His big-play abilities will come in handy for the Chargers in the coming weeks and he could be a helpful hand in your championship game.\n\nWeek 17 matchup: vs. Houston Texans, 4:30 p.m. ET (Saturday afternoon)\n\nMany playmakers played a hand in the Seahawks’ frantic 38-37 overtime victory over the Rams on Thursday and chief among them was Barner. He maneuvered his way around the Rams defense and got open for a 26-yard fourth-quarter touchdown that ended up tying the game for Seattle. He ended his night with a respectable line of four receptions for 49 receiving yards and the aforementioned score.\n\nThis marked the first time the second-year Michigan product had found the end zone since his two-touchdown day against the Buccaneers way back in Week 5. They’re going up against a Panthers team that has given up the 10th-most receiving yards to opposing tight ends this year, so there’s a chance for him to have a repeat performance from last Thursday.\n\nWeek 17 matchup: @ Carolina Panthers, 1 p.m. ET\n\nSix straight wins for the Jaguars makes for a team that is hitting their stride just in time for the playoffs and they’re getting quality performances from multiple playmakers on offense. Strange is in that camp and he came away with five catches for 39 receiving yards and a second-quarter touchdown in their 34-20 victory over the Broncos on Sunday.\n\nTrevor Lawrence has spread the wealth around his offense and Strange has popped up as a beneficiary from time to time, recently posting a 93-yard performance against the Cardinals in Week 11. If you’re in your championship game and need a waiver option that will give you a shot in the arm, then you’d want to seek out Jags playmakers like Strange.\n\nWeek 17 matchup: @ Indianapolis Colts, 1 p.m. ET",

He will be in attendance for the Detroit Lions at the Minnesota Vikings, providing insight on the NFC North rivals.\n\n\"Well, my hope at that point is that the Bears have locked up a spot in the playoffs, and I don't have to stress. However, they have a hell of a schedule coming up. They got Green Bay and San Francisco, then finished with Detroit,\" said Rollins, \"So for one night only, I will be a Minnesota Vikings fan. Don't tell anybody from Detroit. But yeah, I'm going to be rooting for the Vikings. I'm probably going to need them to take the Lions down a peg so that the Bears can lock in and get it done. But yeah, it should be a fun game.\"\n\nThe streaming service returns on Christmas Day with another NFL global doubleheader, following the Kansas City Chiefs' victory in last year's first-ever broadcast over the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nGet ready for some action-packed Christmas magic 🎄 \n\nDallas Cowboys vs. Washington Commanders at 1 PM ET \nDetroit Lions vs. Minnesota Vikings at 4:30 PM ET \n\nLIVE on Netflix December 25 pic.twitter.com/pVUKmqtrCM\n\n— Netflix Sports (@netflixsports) December 3, 2025\n\nThe Vikings will rely on 2024 first-round draft pick J.J. McCarthy, who has been inconsistent due to injuries, while the Lions try to regain the dominant form that propelled them last season.\n\n\"Curious to see the progression of J.J. McCarthy and what he looks like in Kevin O'Connell's offense as he goes through sort of what his rookie year is. Obviously, he missed last season with the injury, but it's kind of his first go-around,\" said Rollins, \"Which Lions are we going to get? Lions from last year that dominated and maybe made an early playoff exit, or are we going to get a Lions team that misses the playoffs this season? It's going to be very interesting to see. Looking forward to the matchup, and yeah, I will be saying 'Skol' all afternoon.\"\n\nNetflix's inaugural NFL Christmas games in 2024 smashed streaming records, with the Chiefs vs. Steelers game averaging over 24 million U.S. viewers and reaching nearly 65 million unique viewers across the doubleheader, making it the most-streamed NFL games ever on the platform.\n\nRollins will star in WWE Unreal Season 2, premiering on January 20, 2026: https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/wwe-unreal-season-2-release-date-trailer-news.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: WWE Superstar Seth Rollins discusses Netflix's NFL Christmas Gameday",

    "fullText": "Bob Chesney refused to let one night define James Madison originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nJames Madison’s season ended under the Oregon lights, but Bob Chesney spoke afterward like a man still carrying the full weight of the journey.\n\nThis was Chesney’s final game leading the James Madison Dukes, and the emotion in his voice reflected more than a loss.\n\n“We needed to play elite football,” Chesney said. “We needed to play our best football of the entire year. The complementary football we’ve been playing all year just didn’t show up.”\n\nThere were flashes on every side of the ball, but never the cohesion required to survive that stage. Chesney refused to let that reality overshadow the year.\n\n“It had to be elite to hang with this team,” he said. “And it just wasn’t.”\n\nMORE: College Football Playoff expansion proposals that could have changed everything for Notre Dame and BYU\n\nAgainst Oregon, moments appeared. Productive drives. Defensive plays. Special teams contributions. But the alignment never fully arrived, and against an opponent like that, gaps get punished. Chesney didn’t dodge that truth, but he also didn’t allow it to consume the night.\n\nInstead of heading straight to the locker room, Chesney stayed on the field. He stood at the edge of the end zone and hugged every player as they walked off.\n\n“I told them to take those pads off slowly,” he said. “For some of them, it’ll be the last time they’re taking those pads off.”\n\nThat image lingered heavier than any statistic.\n\nDown big at halftime, James Madison didn’t fold. The Dukes kept competing. They kept throwing. They kept fighting. Chesney pointed to belief and leadership as the constant that never cracked.\n\n“I thought our guys just never stopped believing,” he said. “They felt like they wanted to go out, and if they were going to go out, they wanted to go out with a fight, and I think that’s something we can all be really proud of.”\n\nWhen asked about broader criticism surrounding non-power programs reaching this stage, Chesney narrowed the focus. The conversation, he said, was never about proving a point. It was about preparation, belief, and opportunity.\n\n“We came here to accomplish a task,” he said. “It doesn’t take away from what we did during the course of the year.”\n\nWhat mattered most to Chesney was the state of the program he was leaving behind.\n\n“This is a program steeped in tradition,” he said. “It believes in itself. It has a community that supports it, and that support is only getting stronger.”\n\nAs Chesney prepares to move on to UCLA, his final message in purple wasn’t about leaving. It was about what remains.\n\n“The sky’s the limit for this program,” he said.\n\nMiami superfan Abella Danger teases ‘quite informative’ reason for cheering on Canes in CFP\n\nKane Wommack says Alabama’s culture showed itself when the punches came\n\nFormer LSU star Livvy Dunne reveals her ambitions for the big screen\n\nThree Clemson defenders projected as first round picks in latest CBS Sports NFL mock draft",

So, we’ve got to keep that feeling going the next couple of weeks and build some momentum.\n\n“I’m having fun playing football,” Burrow said. “Not playing football is not fun. Sitting in the locker room rehabbing all day, that’s not why you do it. This is why you do it right here.”\n\nThis is Burrow’s second game with four touchdown passes in three weeks, giving him 10 in his previous four games since returning from a turf toe injury.\n\nWhile the Bengals will miss the Playoffs for a third straight season, Burrow reminded everybody on Sunday why he is one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL.\n\nYou just hope the Bengals front office can, like they did in 2021, build a strong team around him.

Countless athletes stood out on the gridiron as they represented their schools in quests for glory.\n\nHere are the nominees for the Statesman Journal’s football player of the year.\n\nHere’s information on the nominees.

A senior, he finished the season with 1,459 rushing yards and 21 rushing touchdowns, both being the fourth-highest 6A tallies in the state.\n\nPhillips earned all-state second-team offensive honors.\n\nRivers was a force to be reckoned with on the Dallas defense this season. At the 5A level, the Dragons' senior led the state of Oregon in sacks (11), was fifth in total tackles (99) and tied for third in forced fumbles (3). Rivers was an integral part of a dominant defense that gave up less than 14 points in eight different games this fall.\n\nRivers claimed a spot on the all-state defensive first team.\n\nSingleton was a two-way sensation for the Vikings from the wide receiver and defensive back positions this fall. The North Salem senior delivered 986 yards of total offense and nine touchdowns, while also grabbing two interceptions and 58 tackles.\n\nSingleton earned a spot on all-state second-team defense and offensive all-state honorable mention as a wide receiver and kick returner. He's one of two area players from 6A/5A/4A with three different bids to the all-state rosters.\n\nSilverton's junior Swiss army-knife of a player contributed to both sides of the ball in the Foxes' march to a 5A state championship. Teeney, a junior, fielded as a receiver, defensive back and even running back at times — contributing invaluable reps with the Foxes.\n\nTeeney booked a spot on the all-state defensive first-team lineup.\n\nUitto was a key part of Silverton’s 5A state championship march from the wide receiver and defensive back positions. Uitto, a senior, garnered 798 receiving yards and 13 receiving touchdowns this season, tallies good for fourth and second at the 5A level, respectively.\n\nUitto stamped his name on the all-state offensive first-team roster and earned a bid to the all-state honorable mention defense.\n\nWusstig was a two-way receiver/defensive back for West Salem that excelled in both. Wusstig, a senior, helped the Titans to a 6-4 record and playoff appearance and was consistently one of the most impactful players on any football field he stepped on.\n\nWusstig was named to the defensive all-state second team.\n\nLandon Bartlett covers high school sports and Oregon State for the Statesman Journal.

Or was there a case for a red card to Van de Ven?\n\nRightly or wrongly, defenders are rarely penalised for their challenges after a shot is struck by an attacker. These are tackles which you would expect to be punished if they happened elsewhere on the pitch.\n\nThe Premier League's Key Match Incidents (KMI) panel voted 3-2 that Manchester City should have been awarded a penalty at Newcastle last month.\n\nFabian Schar had kicked through the boot of Phil Foden after he had taken a shot, but there was no VAR intervention.\n\nAs Isak scored there is obviously no case for a penalty. But could the VAR have deemed it a red card for serious foul play?\n\nOpinions may be influenced by the injury to Isak but it does not have to be the result of foul play - it can simply be an unfortunate consequence.\n\nIt is important to look at how Van de Ven makes the challenge, and also how Isak comes to sustain the injury.\n\nAs Isak releases the shot, Van de Ven slides in to try to make a block.\n\nCrucially, it is Isak's shooting foot that gets injured after he plants it.\n\nThe foot lands between Van de Ven's legs, and that is how the Sweden striker's injury appears to happen.\n\nHad Van de Ven gone through Isak's standing foot or tackled his opponent directly this would have been a different discussion.\n\nBut Van de Ven goes to make a block into the space in front of Isak. It was a genuine challenge and should not be seen as a red card.\n\nThat does not mean a defender cannot be sent off if they try to stop a shot and clatter into an attacker.\n\nWe can look at the double leg fracture sustained by Manchester United's Luke Shaw in a Champions League game against PSV Eindhoven in 2015.\n\nShaw had burst into the area to take a shot when Hector Moreno crashed into him, taking his standing foot away in a scissors tackle.\n\nIt came in the days before VAR, so Moreno did not even concede a penalty let alone get a red card. But it is exactly the kind of blocking tackle which should see a player sent off now.\n\nVan de Ven's challenge, however, appears to be an accidental collision as part of a normal defensive action.\n\nWere Newcastle denied 'stonewall' penalty against Chelsea?\n\nIsak injury in chaotic Liverpool win gives Slot more problems\n\nTop and bottom at Christmas - what does it mean?\n\nTottenham boss Thomas Frank was not happy with several decisions which went against his side in Saturday's 2-1 home loss.\n\nXavi Simons was sent off after catching Virgil van Dijk on the back of the calf as he closed down the Liverpool defender.\n\nReferee John Brooks had only shown a yellow card, but was sent to the pitchside monitor by the VAR Stuart Attwell.\n\nFrank said \"the game is gone if that's a red card\". Yet the consensus among former players was it was the right decision.\n\nOn Match of the Day, Joe Hart said: \"That is such a dangerous tackle, he's caught him on the back of the Achilles, it's absolutely a red card.\"\n\nReferees' chief Howard Webb last season made it clear this kind of challenge should lead to a VAR review.\n\nHis comments came after Leicester City's Wilfred Ndidi was not sent off after raking his studs down the calf of Chelsea's Cole Palmer in an incident which was similar to Simons on Van Dijk.\n\nWebb said of Ndidi's foul: \"We've looked at this collectively, among the officials, talked about this, and we would prefer this to be dealt with with a red card. We have to protect player safety.\"\n\nBut what about a possible red card for Alejandro Garnacho earlier in the day? The Chelsea forward only received a caution for his foul on Newcastle's Jacob Ramsey.\n\nThe decision of referee Andy Madley was supported by the VAR Peter Bankes.\n\nThere are some important differences to consider.\n\nThe ball was in playing distance when Garnacho started the challenge. While he did then lead into Ramsey with his studs there was no force or intensity - and only a small amount of contact.\n\nIf a player is stepping into a tackle and mistimes it slightly a caution is seen as an acceptable disciplinary outcome, even if initial contact is above the boot.\n\nChallenges from behind, as with Simons, where there is no possibility of getting to the ball are far more likely to result in a red card.\n\nIf Frank was annoyed about the Simons red, he was even more angry about Liverpool's second goal.\n\nJeremie Frimpong's cross took a slight deflection, and Huge Ekitike rose above Cristian Romero to head home.\n\n\"There is a massive mistake by John [Brooks] on the pitch. Two hands on the back by Ekitike,\" Frank said.\n\n\"Luckily we have VAR so they will bail you out when you need it, which they didn't.\"\n\nEkitike's hands were on Romero, but there did not appear to be any force applied to foul the defender. It looked like a strong, powerful header.\n\nEarlier this season Manchester United scored at Fulham when Leny Yoro had two hands on the back of Calvin Bassey. The goal stood after a VAR check.\n\nThe KMI panel voted 3-2 that it should have been ruled out on the field, but 4-1 that it had not reached the threshold for the VAR to intervene.\n\nYoro had pushed slightly forward on the back of Bassey, but there was no such action from Ekitike on Romero.\n\nIt is very unlikely the panel would see the Ekitike goal as an error by either the referee or the VAR.\n\nFormer Newcastle goalkeeper Shay Given agreed on Match of the Day: \"I think John Brooks has got it right.\"\n\nGet news, insight and fan views on your Premier League team\n\nAll your football quizzes in one place",

    "fullText": "When is Bryan Mbeumo back from AFCON? Cameroon schedule, Man United return date after 2025 Africa Cup of Nations originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nManchester United look like being one of the Premier League teams to be hit hardest by the Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nThe Red Devils have lost Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui for the coming couple of weeks at least. Given that is effectively the entire right-hand side of their first-choice XI, it's a significant puzzle for head coach Ruben Amorim to solve.\n\nAs much as a successful time in Morocco could do wonders for the morale of their players amid another difficult season, United fans will likely hope that their trio are back in England as soon as possible, particularly given the hectic festive fixture schedule and some big games looming in January.\n\nThe Sporting News looks at the games Mbeumo will definitely miss and when he could be back at Amorim's disposal.\n\nMORE:Complete AFCON 2025 schedule and bracket\n\nThe 2025 Africa Cup of Nations will begin on December 21, contested for a month all the way up until the final on January 18.\n\nOriginally scheduled for this past June and July, AFCON was pushed back to the winter due to the 2025 Club World Cup scheduled for action in the United States over the same time.\n\nAll players will return to their clubs from Africa Cup of Nations duty once their team is eliminated from the competition, unless injury or other exception sees them depart early.\n\nCameroon would ordinarily be considered a major contender at any AFCON, but they have endured a troubled year. The five-time champions are embroiled in a chaotic dispute concerning FA president Samuel Eto'o and Marc Brys, the head coach who disputes his own dismissal. There is not even complete certainty over who is in the tournament squad, with two separate rosters announced as part of the ongoing feud.\n\nWith Cameroon drawn into a potentially tricky group alongside 2023 winners Ivory Coast, Gabon and Mozambique, it is hard to predict how well they will perform.\n\nThe earliest Mbeumo or any player could be back with their club would be the end of the group stage on December 31, so it's safer for United fans to assume he will definitely miss three games and probably more like four or five.\n\nMORE:Most successful teams in AFCON history\n\nCameroon being their Group F campaign against Gabon on Christmas Eve, then Ivory Coast on December 28 and Mozambique on December 31.\n\nWinning the group would see them face the runners-up of Group E (Algeria, Burkina Faso, Equatorial Guinea, Sudan) in the Round of 16. Second place in the group would mean a clash with the runners-up of Group B (Egypt, South Africa, Angola, Zimbabwe). They could also progress as one of the four best third-place teams, in which case they would meet the winners of Group C or D, which could mean one of Egypt, Nigeria or Tunisia.\n\nAdrar Stadium (Agadir, Morocco)\n\nMarrakech Stadium (Marrakech, Morocco)\n\nAdrar Stadium (Agadir, Morocco)\n\nMarrakech Stadium (Marrakech, Morocco)\n\nQuarterfinals vs. TBD (1st Group B vs. 3rd place Group A/C/D)\n\nAdrar Stadium (Agadir, Morocco)\n\nTangier Grand Stadium (Tangier, Morocco)\n\nPrince Moulay Abdellah Stadium (Rabat, Morocco)\n\nAl Medina Stadium (Rabat, Morocco)\n\nQuarterfinals vs. TBD (1st Group A vs. 3rd place C/D/E)\n\nPrince Moulay Abdellah Stadium (Rabat, Morocco)\n\nPrince Moulay Abdellah Stadium (Rabat, Morocco)\n\nPrince Moulay Abdellah Stadium (Rabat, Morocco)\n\nMbeumo was granted special dispensation to play for United in their gripping 4-4 draw with Bournemouth on December 15, but he will now miss at least Premier League matches.\n\nIf Cameroon are knocked out in the group stage, Mbeumo would likely be available for United's game at Leeds United on January 4. Should they progress all the way to the final, the forward would be unavailable for United for a further three matches, including the Manchester derby on January 17.\n\nMatches Mbeumo is guaranteed to miss\n\nMatches Mbeumo could potentially miss",

    "fullText": "Whilst Arsenal had a pretty good warm-up game ahead of the League Cup quarter-final by beating Everton on Saturday, Tuesday’s opponents Crystal Palace were losing 4-1 to Leeds United.\n\nThere was definitely a theme to the goals Palace conceded, with Leeds scoring from two long throws, one corner, and one free-kick. It was only thanks to an impressive Dean Henderson save that they didn’t concede a fifth from another corner.\n\nA lot of the talk early in the 2025/26 campaign was about Arsenal’s strength on set-pieces, and Marc Guehi conceded after the Leeds game that their defensive set-piece abilities would be tested again in midweek.\n\n“We will play a team who are better than Leeds at set-pieces,” Guehi admitted. “So if we can defend better and contain them in our low block then counterattack, it will be good for us.\n\n“It is another tough game, so we have to learn quickly and move on.”\n\nWith less than three days between Arsenal and Palace’s weekend fixtures and their midweek League Cup clash, it’s likely there will be some rotation in both teams.\n\nThe two sides will want to progress to the semi-finals if they can, but both played close to their first-choice sides at the weekend. Lasting another 90 minutes on Tuesday won’t be easy for the players involved.\n\nIn conditions like that, perhaps set-pieces could prove to be pivotal once again.",

    "fullText": "annas-archive.li/blog, 2025-12-20, Discuss on Hacker News\n\nWe backed up Spotify (metadata and music files). It’s distributed in bulk torrents (~300TB), grouped by popularity.\n\nThis release includes the largest publicly available music metadata database with 256 million tracks and 186 million unique ISRCs.\n\nIt’s the world’s first “preservation archive” for music which is fully open (meaning it can easily be mirrored by anyone with enough disk space), with 86 million music files, representing around 99.6% of listens.\n\nAnna’s Archive normally focuses on text (e.g. books and papers). We explained in “The critical window of shadow libraries” that we do this because text has the highest information density. But our mission (preserving humanity’s knowledge and culture) doesn’t distinguish among media types. Sometimes an opportunity comes along outside of text. This is such a case.\n\nA while ago, we discovered a way to scrape Spotify at scale. We saw a role for us here to build a music archive primarily aimed at preservation.\n\nGenerally speaking, music is already fairly well preserved. There are many music enthusiasts in the world who digitized their CD and LP collections, shared them through torrents or other digital means, and meticulously catalogued them.\n\nHowever, these existing efforts have some major issues:\n\nThis Spotify scrape is our humble attempt to start such a “preservation archive” for music. Of course Spotify doesn’t have all the music in the world, but it’s a great start.\n\nBefore we dive into the details of this collection, here is a quick overview:\n\nThe data will be released in different stages on our Torrents page:\n\nFor now this is a torrents-only archive aimed at preservation, but if there is enough interest, we could add downloading of individual files to Anna’s Archive. Please let us know if you’d like this.\n\nPlease help preserve these files:\n\nWith your help, humanity’s musical heritage will be forever protected from destruction by natural disasters, wars, budget cuts, and other catastrophes.\n\nIn this blog we will analyze the data and look at details of the release. We hope you enjoy.\n\n— Volunteer “ez” of Anna’s Archive team\n\nLet’s dive into the data! Here's some high-level statistics pulled from the metadata:\n\nSpotify has around 256 million tracks.\n\nThe most convenient available way to sort songs on Spotify is using the popularity metric, defined as follows:\n\nThe popularity of a track is a value between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular. The popularity is calculated by algorithm and is based, in the most part, on the total number of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are.\n\nGenerally speaking, songs that are being played a lot now will have a higher popularity than songs that were played a lot in the past. Duplicate tracks (e.g. the same track from a single and an album) are rated independently. Artist and album popularity is derived mathematically from track popularity.\n\nIf we group songs by popularity, we see that there is an extremely large tail end:\n\n≥70% of songs are ones almost no one ever listens to (stream count < 1000). To see some detail, we can plot this on a logarithmic scale:\n\nThe top 10,000 songs span popularities 70-100. You can view them all in this HTML file (13.8MB gzipped).\n\nAdditionally, we can estimate the number of listens per track and total number per popularity. The stream count data is estimated since it is difficult to fetch at scale, so we sampled it randomly.\n\nAs we can see, most of the listens come from songs with a popularity between 50 and 80, even though there's only 210.000 songs with popularity ≥50, around 0.1% of songs. Note the huge (subjectively estimated) error bar on pop=0 — the reason for this is that Spotify does not publish stream counts for songs with < 1000 streams.\n\nWe can also estimate that the top three songs (as of writing) have a higher total stream count than the bottom 20-100 million songs combined:\n\nNote that the popularity is very time-dependent and not directly translatable into stream counts, so these top songs are basically arbitrary.\n\nWe have archived around 86 million songs from Spotify, ordering by popularity descending. While this only represents 37% of songs, it represents around 99.6% of listens:\n\nPut another way, for any random song a person listens to, there is a 99.6% likelihood that it is part of the archive. We expect this number to be higher if you filter to only human-created songs. Do remember though that the error bar on listens for popularity 0 is large.\n\nFor popularity=0, we ordered tracks by a secondary importance metric based on artist followers and album popularity, and fetched in descending order.\n\nWe have stopped here due to the long tail end with diminishing returns (700TB+ additional storage for minor benefit), as well as the bad quality of songs with popularity=0 (many AI generated, hard to filter).\n\nBefore diving into more fun stats, let’s look at how the collection itself is structured. It’s in two parts: metadata and music files, both of which are distributed through torrents.\n\nThe metadata torrents contain, based on statistical analysis, around 99.9% of artists, albums, tracks. The metadata is published as compact queryable SQLite databases. Care was taken, by doing API response reconstruction, that there is (almost) no data loss in the conversion from the API JSON.\n\nThe metadata for artists, albums, tracks is less than 200 GB compressed. The secondary metadata of audio analysis is 4TB compressed.\n\nWe look at more detail at the structure of the metadata at the end of this blog post.\n\nThe data itself is distributed in the Anna’s Archive Containers (AAC) format. This is a standard which we created a few years ago for distributing files across multiple torrents. It is not to be confused with the Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) encoding format.\n\nSince the original files contain zero metadata, as much metadata as possible was added to the OGG files, including title, url, ISRC, UPC, album art, replaygain information, etc. The invalid OGG data packet Spotify prepends to every track file was stripped — it is present in the track_files db.\n\nFor popularity>0, the quality is the original OGG Vorbis at 160kbit/s. Metadata was added without reencoding the audio (and an archive of diff files is available to reconstruct the original files from Spotify).\n\nFor popularity=0, the audio is reencoded to OGG Opus at 75kbit/s — sounding the same to most people, but noticeable to an expert.\n\nThere is a known bug where the REPLAYGAIN_ALBUM_PEAK vorbiscomment tag value is a copy-paste of REPLAYGAIN_ALBUM_GAIN instead of the correct value for many files.\n\nMany people complain about how Spotify shuffles tracks. Since we have metadata for 99.9+% of tracks on Spotify, we can create a true shuffle across all songs on Spotify!\n\nWe're curious about the peaks at whole minutes (particularly 2:00, 3:00, 4:00). If you know why this is, please let us know!\n\nSome songs, especially popular songs, have 2, 3, or even 20 different versions. We can quantify this by counting number of songs per ISRC:\n\nEach song on Spotify is only available on a specific set of markets. Most songs are available on most markets, but if we filter to popular songs, you can see a difference in availability (without filtering, the graph is almost flat):\n\nSpotify provides a list of genres per artist (not per song). If we count the artists for each genre, we get this result:\n\nSince each genre is very specific, we can also group genres and count the results:\n\nWe can also group artists by popularity. The resulting graph looks very similar to the tracks popularity graph:\n\nThe same graph for albums also looks the same.\n\nIf we group albums by release year, we see that more and more new music is added to Spotify, a lot of it likely automatically generated:\n\nThe amount of procedurally and AI generated content makes it hard to find what is actually valuable.\n\nYou can see that most songs on Spotify are singles, not part of an album.\n\nWe also scraped audio features generated by Spotify. They can be analyzed to find interesting trends.\n\nThis chart contains a lot of information. You can for example see that loudness correlates with energy and that BPM is normally distributed with a mean around 120.\n\nA scrape of the three main APIs of Spotify: artists, albums, tracks. Each track exists in exactly one album, but each track and each album can have multiple artists.\n\nThe tables are an almost lossless representation of Spotify API JSON responses, care was taken during creation by always reconstructing the original JSON based on each inserted row, with minor exceptions.\n\nA scrape of AudioFeatures objects from the Spotify API. One row per track.\n\nA scrape of Playlist objects from the Spotify API. Requires the spotify_clean.sqlite3 database to map track_rowid to track_id.\n\nMost playlists with < 1000 followers were excluded. Completeness unknown.\n\nRow count: 6.6 million playlists with 1.7 billion playlist tracks.\n\nThis is an almost lossless representation of the original Spotify API response. JSON reconstruction was tested during creation of all tables, with minor exceptions. For example, the original response JSON for playlists can be reconstructed with code similar to the following:\n\nThe link between the tracks table in spotify_clean and the actual files we have.\n\nRaw JSON API responses for audiobooks on Spotify.

Contains around 54 million rows. Incomplete.\n\nRedirect responses for the artist endpoint.\n\nRaw JSON API responses for audio analysis on Spotify.\n Contains around 40 million rows, fetched in descending priority order. Many songs do not have an audio analysis (404). Incomplete.\n\nAlbum art files. Correspond to last part of url from album_images.

    "description": ": Rising rack densities are driving changes from grid connection to chip-level delivery",
    "fullText": "Power semiconductors are soon set to become as vital as GPUs and CPUs in datacenters, handling the rapidly increasing loads forecast for AI infrastructure.\n\nThe AI craze has seen datacenter operators stuffing servers with as many accelerators (typically GPUs) as will fit inside, then filling the racks in their data halls with these high-performance boxes.\n\nWith some GPUs now using 700 W of energy each, the power required by an entire rack or datacenter of kit is growing rapidly, putting a strain on electrical distribution infrastructure.\n\nLast year, Nvidia introduced an integrated rack-scale system for AI processing, the DGX GB200 NVL72, which needs 120 kW per unit, while cloud giant Google disclosed this year that it is planning for datacenter racks supporting 1 MW of IT hardware loads.\n\nTo cap it all, some of the key infrastructure components such as transformers are reported to be holding things up through long lead times of 28 weeks or more.\n\nThis is where power semiconductors come into the picture. They enable solid-state transformers (SSTs), which are much smaller and more efficient than their conventional counterparts – perhaps just 500 kg as opposed to multiple tons.\n\n\"What's now being introduced is a solid-state transformer that has a couple of advantages on the supply chain side, but also on this performance side, and that is a pretty new application,\" said Dr Peter Wawer, division president for Green Industrial Power at chipmaker Infineon.\n\nSSTs are a great deal lighter and smaller, Wawer told us, because they operate at very high frequency, a couple of orders of magnitude higher than the AC power supply frequency fed into them. Because the solid-state transformer switches at such high frequency, it requires silicon carbide components.\n\n\"Silicon carbide is the only material that has the capability to switch at high frequency and has high blocking voltages. And for blocking voltage, we mean up to two or three kilovolts (kV), which this semiconductor device will need to block,\" Wawer said. \"But then, of course, you have input voltages of more than 30 kV, and therefore you have to stack more than 10 of the devices in a kind of cascaded structure.\"\n\nInfineon is a prominent supplier of power semiconductors, and so has an interest in pushing the development of solid-state components that are set to be in demand as the datacenter build boom continues.\n\nThe firm expects that SSTs will replace a portion of the datacenter transformer market and could be worth up to $1 billion by 2030, for example.\n\nCircuit breakers are nother application where power semiconductors may replace legacy kit. These electromechanical devices open up in a few milliseconds in the event of a short circuit, but a silicon carbide solid-state version can open much faster, in microseconds – handy if you are dealing with high voltages being supplied to racks full of very expensive GPUs.\n\nPower semiconductors, based on silicon carbide or gallium nitride, are also set to play a part in the power distribution around the datacenter itself.\n\nNvidia has signposted that it sees 800 VDC power supplies as the way forward, as the power demands of AI infrastructure get ever higher, saying this move will be required to support 1 MW IT racks and beyond. It claims this reduces the number of voltage conversions needed, which can introduce inefficiencies and increase the complexity of the electrical system, among other things.\n\nIt is also a way of minimizing losses, according to Infineon, because the power loss is proportional to the square of the current. The trick therefore, when you want to go to a higher power and keep losses under control, is to increase the voltage to a level that means you keep the current constant.\n\n\"Today, you have a combined rack that has the IT payload as well as the power delivery and the backup power. Now, as the GPUs, TPUs, and ASICs increase in power, that means that you need to bring in more power into the racks themselves,\" said Adam White, division president for Power & Sensor Systems at Infineon.\n\n\"So we now move to this potential 800 volt DC supply, but you've also got the plus-minus 400-volt topologies that some vendors [such as Google] may end up using. We call this then the hybrid microgrid.\"\n\n\"Why 800 volts DC? Effectively, you can bring that directly into the motherboards or into the compute trays, using fewer conversion steps,\" he added.\n\nHowever, Infineon believes that before we can get to that step, there will have to be an intermediate stage, where a \"power sidecar\" – effectively a second rack full of power delivery and backup circuitry – will sit alongside the rack of IT kit it serves. Whether this serves just one rack or several will depend on the IT load.\n\nThis arrangement is expected to see racks hitting 600 kW of power, up from the maximum of about 125 kW today, to support configurations using Nvidia's Rubin Ultra, expected to arrive in late 2027.\n\nGoogle also mentions a \"sidecar\" in its plans for 1 MW kit, as a dedicated AC-to-DC power rack that feeds power to the other racks.\n\nAs power demand rises, the power supply unit (PSU) within the rack will need to handle more power, with 8 kW units available now. There will also be a transition to a three-phase design to move from a 12 kW unit to 16 kW or above, which is expected to happen next year. This transition will see greater use of components made with silicon carbide and gallium nitride (GaN), according to Infineon.\n\nFinally, the increasing density of the AI accelerators themselves and the amount of power all those transistors guzzle is starting to have an impact at the chip level.\n\nThe voltage regulator modules (VRMs) are currently discrete packages that sit alongside the accelerator chip package (GPU, ASIC or TPU) on the system board, but as the current to the chip rises, parasitic losses also increase, wasting energy.\n\n\"Some of the industry has already recognized that and started to move to what we call BVM, or back-side vertical power module,\" White said. This moves the VRMs to the other side of the system board, below the accelerator chip package, and simplifies the board layout as well as reducing overall power delivery network losses.\n\nUltimately, the industry would like to get to the point where the VRM moves inside the chip package and is embedded in the substrate directly beneath the chip, but this is a development set for beyond 2027, according to Infineon. ®",

    "fullText": "Ruth Umoh is the Next to Lead editor at Fortune, covering the next generation of C-Suite leaders. She also authors Fortune’s Next to Lead newsletter.\n\nInternal promotions remain the dominant path to the top of America’s largest companies. As of June 30, 2025, nearly 60% of S&P 500 C-suite leaders were appointed from inside their own organizations, reinforcing the enduring value of leadership development and disciplined succession planning.\n\nThat internal bias is even stronger at the very top, according to a Spencer Stuart report. Seventy-six percent of CEOs and 80% of chief operating officers (often a stepping stone to the corner office) were promoted from within their companies, making these roles the most likely to be filled by insiders.\n\nCompany scale plays a meaningful role in these outcomes. Larger organizations, particularly those with multiple business units, tend to generate deeper internal talent benches. More functional leadership roles allow high-potential executives to be developed, tested, and rotated across the enterprise, increasing the odds that boards can look inward when critical roles open.\n\nExternal hiring still remains a vital lever, especially when companies need to strengthen capabilities in highly specialized areas such as technology, but it is typically used selectively rather than as the default.\n\nIndustry dynamics also shape internal promotion rates. In the industrial and consumer sectors, 61% and 62% of C-suite leaders, respectively, were internal appointments. Healthcare and technology trail with 56 percent—the lowest share of insiders among major sectors. Even when companies recruit externally, expectations differ by role. For CEOs and COOs, industry experience remains a strong prerequisite, with fewer than 20% of external hires coming from outside the company’s sector.\n\nTaken together, the data suggest that building a long runway inside an organization, gaining breadth across functions and business units, and developing a track record of industry expertise continue to outweigh external visibility alone when boards make their most consequential decision for the top job.\n\nCheck out the 2026 most powerful rising executives in the Fortune 500\n\nNext to Lead will be off for the holidays and back in your inbox on Jan. 5.\n\nRuth Umoh\nruth.umoh@fortune.com\n\nFlexible futures.

    "title": "Healthcare VCs predict more AI transparency investment, private equity M&A, and a quiet year for IPOs in 2026",
    "description": "It's been a hot year for healthcare venture investment. Backers said they expect investments in AI cost savings in 2026, plus more M&A — but not IPOs.",
    "fullText": "It's been a hot year for healthcare deals — but some investors are predicting a shift in which startups will capture VC attention next year.\n\n2025 saw a welcome surge in healthcare venture funding as investors rushed to back top AI startups. Last December, VCs predicted huge funding rounds for AI scribe startups like Abridge and Ambience Healthcare; indeed, both Abridge and Ambience landed hundreds of millions of dollars in venture funding this year.\n\nInvestors also said in December 2024 that they anticipated a race for those startups to expand beyond AI health scribing into other product lines, like medical coding and billing. That pressure intensified in August, when medical records giant Epic announced it was releasing its own AI tools, including for clinical documentation, in competition with its closest startup partner Abridge.\n\nWith Epic in the mix and tech giants like OpenAI working on their own healthcare AI plays, VCs told Business Insider that they're expecting different profiles of healthcare startups to grab funding next year as companies focus on cost savings, securing patient and provider trust, and ensuring high-quality data.\n\n\"AI has diffused nicely for passive listening in clinical settings, and administrative simplification,\" said Dan Mendelson, the CEO of Morgan Health, JPMorgan's healthcare investing arm. \"AI now needs to show savings to payers by helping consumers make good choices and reducing the burden on clinicians.\"\n\nInvestors are also watching for more healthcare exits in 2026. Two venture-backed digital health companies went public this year: Hinge Health in May, and Omada Health in June. VCs weren't optimistic that 2026 would bring a deluge of new public healthcare companies, but they're looking forward to what many said should be an active year for healthcare M&A.\n\nThis year, investment surged for AI startups tackling administrative burdens for large health systems. AI scribe startups Abridge and Ambience Healthcare notched $5.3 billion and $1.25 billion valuations, respectively, while AI-powered medical knowledge platform OpenEvidence hit a $6 billion valuation with its own raise.\n\nMany such startups have expanded into coding and billing to help hospitals capture more revenue from health insurers. But in 2026, insurers could use AI to fight back, said Todd Cozzens, cofounder and managing partner of Transformation Capital.\n\nCozzens said that many insurers have already partnered with large organizations such as Palantir and Anthropic on custom AI solutions. Next year, he expects those payers to contract with more specialized AI platforms trained on complex clinical data, like providers are already doing.\n\n\"It's a zero-sum game in the end, but like with the nuclear weapons arms race, a lot of money is going to be spent here, and doing nothing is no longer an option for either side of the battle,\" he said.\n\nSeveral VCs suggested that the next wave of healthcare investment will go toward business models that prioritize higher-quality AI behind the scenes.\n\nSapphire Ventures partner Cathy Gao predicted a conscious shift away from \"black box\" AI models in high-stakes industries like healthcare, calling them \"uninvestable.\"\n\n\"The next healthcare unicorns will be 'glass box' platforms where the core product is the digital paper trail,\" she said. \"Any engineering team can build an AI that fills out a medical form. The real opportunity is building the governance layer that proves why the AI made that decision.\"\n\nLiam Donohue, cofounder and managing partner at .406 Ventures, said his firm has also been investing in companies focused on AI decision transparency and data quality.\n\n\"One of the obstacles that needs to be hurdled for AI to be more widely used in enterprise settings is absolutely the ability to go back to the source of why some process happened or why a decision was made. And there's a lot of infrastructure being built to do that,\" he said.\n\nAs insurers cut reimbursement rates for key services, investors are also expecting a surge in business models that prioritize lower-cost care settings and eschew point solutions, paired with AI to reduce administrative spend.\n\nNorwest partner Irem Rami said she expects a boost for in-home care models that incorporate AI agents. Mercedes Bent, cofounder and partner at Premise VC, is watching healthcare startups that aim to support patients across a chosen specialty, like women's health tech that assists patients from fertility tracking through conception.\n\nTech startups that actually provide healthcare have somewhat fallen out of favor with VCs in recent years. The costs of employing providers or running brick-and-mortar clinics can make it tough for those businesses to deliver venture-style returns.\n\nBut in 2026, according to 7wireVentures partner Alyssa Jaffee, \"tech-enabled services is coming back, baby.\"\n\nAfter 2021's venture boom and the subsequent funding drought, some tech-enabled services companies struggled to maintain their growth or hit their next milestone on slim margins, especially at earlier stages, Jaffee said.\n\nBut many startups that have made it to the other side have stronger businesses as a result, including durable relationships with key customers like health plans, she said.\n\nShe also pointed to Hinge Health and Omada Health's successful IPOs; both companies are tech-enabled service providers that sell to employers and health plans.\n\n\"We have a number of those companies in our portfolio that have really hit their stride. It's just a meatier business, and I think we're going to get a lot of interest from later-stage investors coming in to support those kinds of companies,\" Jaffee said.\n\nNorthzone partner Wendy Xiao said that she's now seeing some employers try out a few different tech-enabled services solutions in a given category, such as GLP-1 management, and test them against one another.\n\nContracting with multiple companies could be a tough sell for employers who are already seeing their healthcare costs skyrocket. But Xiao said many of these startups are paid a portion of the money they save employers — a model that dramatically lowers employers' financial exposure.\n\nThere are a few healthcare companies that could be eyeing the exits next year. Virta Health has publicly said it expects to be IPO-ready in 2026. And Business Insider previously reported that two private-equity-backed healthtech companies, Zelis Healthcare and Ensemble Health, have been in talks with bankers about potential IPOs.\n\nStill, no reports have emerged of venture-backed healthcare startups filing their S-1s. By this time last year, Hinge Health and Omada Health were already deep into their IPO preparations.\n\nWhile Xiao thinks a handful of healthtech startups are waiting for their debuts, she's not confident they'll take the plunge before the second half of 2026.\n\n\"I think they'll probably go out in a similar timeframe of, if not late next year, then the year after. There seems to be a lot of momentum pent up around IPO readiness at the organizational level over the past few years. I think a lot of these companies are in pretty good shape in terms of that, and they're just waiting for one of the larger ones to go out,\" Xiao said.\n\nMichael Greeley, the cofounder and general partner at Flare Capital Partners, agreed that the new year is unlikely to bring a steady stream of new healthcare IPOs. But he's anticipating more M&A activity as interest rates come down and private equity buyers look for healthcare AI acquisitions in the VC world.\n\n\"A lot of us are still sitting on a lot of unrealized gains, and the obsession is going to be heightened around liquidity,\" Greeley said. \"We're seeing a lot more interest from the big buyout funds in our sector, who are going down market to buy AI assets to wrap around their legacy platform companies.\"\n\n2025 saw a few such deals. New Mountain Capital, in particular, made several AI acquisitions this year as the PE firm rolled startups onto its existing healthcare bets. Greeley also pointed to firms such as Bain Capital, TPG, Silver Lake, and KKR as potential buyers in 2026.\n\nDonohue is similarly optimistic that 2026 will bring a flurry of exit activity as more companies mull going public, selling, or merging with a competitor. In particular, he expects strategic buyers, such as health plans, to become more active in the second half of 2026.\n\n\"I actually think it'll be a good exit year. I'm seeing lots of signs of life, both within our portfolio and more broadly. There's a lot of activity percolating that you just haven't seen for the last several years,\" he said.",

    "description": "After being laid off by Oracle, Clair Todd has spent about two years job hunting, reselling antiques, and rethinking her pivot to the tech industry.",
    "fullText": "This \"as-told-to\" essay is based on a conversation with Clair Todd, a 40-year-old job seeker from New Hampshire, who worked as a site reliability engineer for Oracle until being laid off in 2023. Business Insider has verified her employment with documentation. This essay has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI started at Oracle in January 2020 as a site reliability engineer. In November 2023, I started hearing that my Oracle coworkers were getting pulled into Zoom meetings and told they had been laid off. I hoped I wouldn't be next, but I was. My entire team was let go.\n\nI didn't start looking for work right away because I'd received some severance pay, and I'd heard it was difficult to land a tech role during the holiday season. I took some time to reassess what I wanted from my career and began my job search in February 2024.\n\nI was optimistic at first because most of my prior job searches hadn't taken too long. As the months dragged on, it became clear I had the wrong impression of the tech hiring landscape.\n\nMore than two years after being laid off, I'm still unemployed.\n\nWhen I was let go from Oracle, my severance, unemployment benefits, and my emergency fund helped for a while. After going through more than $50,000 in savings, I'm now in a tougher position.\n\nI earn between $500 and $1,000 a month by reselling antiques I find and refurbish, including old instruments, electronics, and collectibles that I purchase on Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist. It's a huge drop from the roughly $5,500 a month I used to take home at Oracle.\n\nIn addition to my mortgage, I have about $45,000 in student debt I need to pay off. I'm covering my mortgage and bills by dipping into savings and selling stocks when necessary.\n\nWhen my washer and dryer broke last year, I had to buy a new set on a payment plan — something I'd never done before. In the past, I would've just paid for it outright.\n\nIn my early 30s, I decided to go back to school and pursue a bachelor's degree. I had spent most of my career in sales and customer service roles, but I didn't see a path to earning the kind of income I wanted. I was still living in a small apartment, and I wanted to own a home someday.\n\nWhen I started thinking seriously about a career change, tech was the obvious choice. My dad, mom, and brother all worked in the field, so it felt like I'd be joining the family business. In 2015, I began pursuing a bachelor's degree in information technology.\n\nAfter graduating in 2018, I landed a software engineering role at a small tech firm. I left that position later that year to take on a quality assurance engineering role at Hitachi Vantara.\n\nI took the role because I saw it as a great opportunity, but the downside was that I lived three hours away from the office. The long hours on the road quickly took a toll.\n\nAt the end of 2019, I accepted my former remote position at Oracle, a role I landed after receiving an employee referral.\n\nMy pivot to tech gave me the income I needed to buy my first home. However, after being laid off and struggling to find work, I've sometimes wondered whether it was worthwhile.\n\nMy job search has been challenging because I'm looking for midlevel roles, and a lot of the positions I've seen appear to be targeting either senior-level or entry-level candidates. I've also been targeting competitive remote roles due to a health situation I'm navigating, which makes it difficult for me to commute or work from an office.\n\nI've had several interviews, but I haven't been able to secure an offer. The technical interviews have been challenging. In one interview, it felt like I was on \"Jeopardy!\" because I was being asked what felt like software engineering trivia questions, and most of them didn't seem relevant to the actual role.\n\nMy family warned me that layoffs are fairly common in tech and that I should be prepared. I built a \"just-in-case\" savings fund over the years, but there's not much left.\n\nA few months ago, after more than a year of searching for work, I decided to stop actively looking for employment and focus on building a website development business.\n\nI would like to return to tech, but I need time to recover from the difficult process of applying and getting repeatedly rejected. I also worried that being out of the workforce for so long made it even harder to land a job, so I figured it was wise to start my business as a backup plan.\n\nMy business is still in its early stages and isn't generating income yet, which is one reason I spend time reselling goods.\n\nIt's been challenging mentally because it feels like you're not good enough when you keep getting rejected. On top of that, you have to worry about paying the bills without money coming in. I don't want to say I've given up, but my search has been extremely discouraging.\n\nI'm also not as passionate about tech as I used to be, which is kind of a shame because I was so excited to get my degree and work in the field. If I hadn't been let go by Oracle, it probably would've been a different story.\n\nBefore I scaled back my job search, I'd started focusing less on Big Tech jobs and more on roles at smaller businesses and startups. The interview process at these companies felt more human, and I was more likely to get updates on my applications — even if it was just a polite rejection.\n\nIf I re-enter the job market, I think I'd definitely focus on smaller companies rather than large corporations.",

    "description": "Alex Yang details founding an AI startup with other high schoolers worldwide to improve Alzheimer's diagnostics.",
    "fullText": "My typical morning starts around 3 a.m. I'm instantly met with Messenger notifications from web developers in California, GitHub pings from Florida, and a running document of research papers to read sent from Michigan. By 7:50 a.m. I'm off to class to live my life as an 18-year-old high school senior in Seoul.\n\nThis solitary ritual has become my strange normal after I founded an AI research and development startup with people all around the world, whom I've never met in person. My ambition was to improve Alzheimer's diagnostics, but I had no network, so I built one online.\n\nGrowing up, I heard stories about various family members battling Alzheimer's. I viewed the disease as something truly terrifying, which leaves behind only the shell of who someone once was.\n\nI'd grown up knowing that someday, someone I love might disappear while still standing in front of me. In high school, this fear crystallized into something beyond passive acceptance.\n\nI came across this competition, looking to fund ideas that can make health more accessible, and decided to apply.\n\nI knew I couldn't do the work alone. I had to find people beyond my network with diverse perspectives and skills capable of building something real together.\n\nI started searching for partners by spending my time on internet forums and pitching my vision. I posted detailed research proposals on Discord servers and created GitHub repositories with preliminary code.\n\nAfter a month of \"nos,\" I got one \"yes\" from California. Then Florida. Then Michigan. Until there were six of us. We named ourselves Reteena (pronounced like \"retina\"), a deliberate wordplay symbolizing our mission to bring new vision to Alzheimer's diagnostics.\n\nWe became something none of us expected: a team of high schoolers from around the world who genuinely believed we could fix Alzheimer's.\n\nI didn't set out to target only high schoolers, but I was on servers mainly for students, and those were the people who responded.\n\nWe've been self-funded and started by conducting research on enhancing the image resolution of low-field MRI, which is a portable and more economically accessible MRI machine. We applied machine learning and deep learning techniques to enhance the quality of low-field MRI scans.\n\nOur goal was radical — to make Alzheimer's diagnostics accessible and affordable for underserved communities by making low-field MRI more reliable. Conducting research together, I realized that my abstract dream had become reality, but reality proved far more demanding than any dream.\n\nI staggered under the crushing weight of the time and dedication that my team was giving. The time zone difference was not an excuse for me to make them wait for responses. Lying awake at night, my stomach knotted with anxiety about \"what should I do next,\" I recognized that my wrong decision could waste months of work from people who believed in me.\n\nDuring those suffocating moments, when doubt was a physical pain in my chest, I'd question everything: my abilities, our direction, and whether I was worthy of the faith my team placed in me.\n\nGradually, my leadership improved, and doubts faded when I stopped seeing our differences as obstacles and started viewing them as strengths. I created a \"follow-the-sun\" workflow where I completed tasks before people in the states woke up, with detailed handoff documents in shared Notion workspaces. We were asynchronous, yet somehow more connected.\n\nWhen our first piece of research was published in the IEEE BigData 2024 Conference, a prestigious annual conference for artificial intelligence research, I felt exhilarated. It was proof that we were onto something and justification for every late night. Yet it was only the beginning.\n\nWe expanded from a six-person group chat into an unconventional startup with 12 members. Over the next nine months, we conducted additional Alzheimer's research and presented our findings on how changes in speech patterns and genetic markers could aid in detecting the disease earlier than traditional methods.\n\nAs people who met on the internet, we've also made our growth transparent on the internet, sharing our journey on LinkedIn. By posting our product-building journey and sharing the authentic rationale behind our research and products, we connected with mentors who believed in what we were doing — Y Combinator founders, Pear VC partners, and researchers who took us seriously despite our age.\n\nWe even started receiving messages from students across different countries asking for advice on starting their own health tech projects.\n\nMost recently, we launched our first consumer product, Remembrance, an AI therapeutic service to try to help Alzheimer's patients reconnect with their past. It works by asking gentle questions designed to trigger old memories through reminiscence therapy.\n\nEach recalled memory is automatically organized in knowledge graph databases, making it easy to revisit and build a personal memory repository. Over time, it can suggest related memories on demand, building a personalized memory archive.\n\nThe healthcare market is impenetrable in many ways. When we attempted to approach a local hospital to test our product using actual patient data, we were immediately halted by compliance requirements and institutional review boards.\n\nWe've spent two years discovering that building something in healthcare is harder than we thought. But I wouldn't change it because we learned that at 17 and 18, not at 25 when the stakes feel higher and the fear feels heavier.\n\nReteena might not end up as we imagined, but that's OK. The point was never the destination; it was about learning how to build, understanding that authentic problems matter more than viral success, and realizing you can inspire people by simply trying.\n\nThat's the real experiment. And it's worth every sleepless night.",

    "description": "Soldiers in Ukraine say that grenades are key for close-quarters trench fighting, and Western forces are paying attention.",
    "fullText": "Grenades — a standard but often unglamorous part of modern infantry combat — have become indispensable in Ukraine's close-quarters and grueling fight against Russia's invasion.\n\nThe war blends advanced technologies like drones and electronic warfare with grinding, World War I-style fighting, where soldiers sometimes battle at arm's length in muddy trenches and bunkers. In those confined spaces, Ukrainian and Russian troops alike rely heavily on grenades.\n\nWestern officials and war veterans in Ukraine told Business Insider about the important role they play in Ukraine's trench warfare. Their use has also evolved, with grenades increasingly getting tactical upgrades, including adaptations for drone drops and components made with 3D printing.\n\nThe experience has highlighted a lesson for Western militaries less accustomed to modern trench fighting, the kind of combat that drives enormous demand for basic infantry munitions like grenades.\n\nUkraine's battlefield is littered with trenches unlike anything the West has seen for decades, with soldiers needing hides and defenses from the attack and surveillance drones that fly overhead, and the brutal fighting involves defending and taking these earthworks from the enemy.\n\nA US veteran who fought in Ukraine and spoke with Business Insider on the condition of anonymity said that \"when you go through these trenches, hand grenades are your best fucking friends.\"\n\nHe said the fights are so close-quarters that in some engagements with the Russians, \"you could literally touch them with the muzzle of your rifle at times.\"\n\nTrenches are messy, uneven, and difficult to capture. \"You're basically trying to take the home of another individual who's lived there for days, weeks, months at this point,\" the vet said. \"So they know every nook and cranny; they know every turn.\"\n\nA British man who fought for Ukraine previously told Business Insider that he carried grenades for both assault and reconnaissance missions and described the US and UK-made grenades as \"prized\" among Ukrainians.\n\nLt. Col. Davidson, a leader in the UK-led training program for Ukrainian soldiers called Operation Interflex, told Business Insider last year on the condition that only his rank and last name be used that \"Ukrainians have got a heavy use of grenades.\" That usage was worked into the training in response.\n\nThere is a wide range of grenades in use in battle, everything from fragmentation and explosive to flashbang and chemical.\n\nA Ukrainian officer recently told Business Insider that smoke grenades can help to create poor visibility so injured soldiers can be evacuated, though it can also risk drawing unwanted Russian attention.\n\nCombat video footage shared by Ukrainian units often shows grenades in action, including footage of US volunteers using them in an assault on a Russian trench.\n\nUkraine's grenades come from multiple sources, from old Soviet-era stocks to those of partner nations.\n\nA January 2025 Department of Defense update said the US had provided \"more than 50,000 grenade launchers and small arms\" and \"more than 500,000,000 rounds of small arms ammunition and grenades\" to Ukraine. And the US isn't the only supplier. The volume supplied reflects how central these weapons are to front-line combat. Ukraine also makes its own grenades.\n\nIt's not alone, though. Russia is also heavily using these weapons, including in the booby traps it sets up in trenches and urban environments.\n\nUkraine feels it when it has shortages of grenades. Another US veteran told Business Insider on the condition of anonymity last year that, with US aid stalled and Ukraine suffering weaponry shortages, he was often told to be \"careful practicing with grenades\" so as not to waste too many.\n\nAnd when it was time to swap positions, troops taking over would ask those departing to leave any remaining grenades and ammunition.\n\n\"That's how desperate that situation got to where it's like guys were literally getting ammo and grenades off of dudes leaving the area so that they could keep fighting.\"\n\nGrenades have long been a staple of infantry combat, including in the recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But Ukraine's conflict has pushed their use to levels more typical of large-scale, attritional warfare, where trench systems stretch for miles and fighting drags on for months and years.\n\nWestern militaries did not anticipate the return of large-scale trench warfare, and in Ukraine that fighting has pushed grenades to the center of daily front-line combat.\n\nLong a standard tool in close-quarters fighting, they have become especially prominent amid widespread trenches, ammunition shortages, and evolving tactics.\n\nWhile they're being used in close-quarters combat, grenades are also being dropped from drones in battles all along the front lines, hitting soldiers, bunkers, hideouts, and even vehicles.\n\nVery recent footage from Novopavlivka front, drone dropping grenade RIGHT INTO RUSSIAN TANK HATCH.\n\nIt falls right into the hatch, destroying the tank from the inside.\n\nHonestly, tanks were so rare this year at the battlefield, and this is just BEAUTIFUL to watch. pic.twitter.com/Ns4NKBH2Qp\n\nA US Army Colonel said doing this has \"proved dramatically effective\" for Ukraine. The Army first tested dropping a live grenade from a drone this year. It's catching up.\n\nUkrainian units and engineers are also 3D-printing parts to make old grenades work better with drones while printing plastic casings to fill with explosives to make custom grenades.\n\nWorried about Russia sparking a wider war with Europe, much of the West is watching to see what lessons it can learn from Ukraine.\n\nMaj. Maguire, a British military officer who led part of the Operation Interflex training and helped document lessons from Ukraine, told Business Insider that the scale and importance of grenade use in trench fighting have stood out. He spoke on the condition that only his rank and last name be used.\n\n\"There's a massive demand for grenades,\" he said.\n\nThe West is looking at trench warfare more, too, and rethinking how messy and dangerous trenches can be and the weapons needed for a fight.\n\nUkraine's war has shown that even on a high-tech battlefield, sustained close combat in trenches still depends on basic infantry weapons and on having enough of them.",

    "description": "A Dell sales leader has told teams in three key offices to be in the office eight hours a day.",
    "fullText": "A top sales executive at Dell has called employees back into the office five days a week … again.\n\n\"Effective immediately, all onsite-classified sales team members are expected to be in the RR, NV, and OKC offices five days a week for at least eight hours per day,\" Jackie Miller, Dell's vice president of North American commercial sales, said in an email sent to enterprise sales staff on November 5, which Business Insider has seen.\n\n\"RR, NV, and OKC\" refer to Dell's headquarters in Round Rock, Texas, and its offices in Nashville and Oklahoma City, which are sites with a concentration of sellers.\n\nMiller's email came over a year after Dell first told its global sales teams to be \"on-site five days a week,\" in September 2024. A similar order followed for the rest of the company in January 2025 and took effect in March.\n\nAfter \"recent site visits\" and \"end-of-day walkthroughs,\" leaders noted that the team was not adhering to the policy, Miller informed staff in the email.\n\n\"I want to reinforce our expectations regarding onsite office presence,\" she said. \"Maintaining a strong in-office presence is essential for fostering collaboration, communication, and productivity, and it is company policy.\"\n\nEmployees should use personal business allowance or vacation hours for time spent away from the office, Miller said.\n\n\"Some leaders are reiterating their expectations of working a full day in the office,\" a Dell spokesperson told Business Insider. \"And as we have said, our team members are expected to work a regular working day in the office, but have flexibility as needed.\"\n\n\"Also, team members in global roles may need to take late evening calls and can adjust their in-office hours accordingly,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of corporate giants like JPMorgan, Amazon, and Starbucks, more companies are steadily tightening work-from-home rules. But getting employees back on-site isn't as simple as sending a one-time memo.\n\nDell's RTO policy has not changed since it was first implemented, but there's been a disconnect between leaders and employees over whether coming to the office five days a week also requires spending eight hours there.\n\nIn June, 10 Dell employees across the US told Business Insider that the enforcement of the RTO policy depended on their manager. Some managers understood \"regular working day\" to mean eight hours a day, while others allowed their teams to badge in and leave soon after without repercussions.\n\n\"Expectations for our team members have not changed,\" Dell told Business Insider in June, adding that employees were \"expected to work a regular working day in the office, but have flexibility as needed\" for things like late evening calls on global teams. The policy does not state that eight hours is the requirement.\n\nAn internal FAQ obtained by Business Insider listed examples of when employees may be permitted to work from home, provided they have approval from a leader. These included a temporary medical condition, needing to provide care on a temporary basis, or adjusting in-office hours to avoid peak traffic.\n\n\"This does not apply to regular childcare, care for dependents, or attending to other personal business,\" the FAQ documents state.\n\nTwo sales team employees said that managers had not enforced the rule since the policy was first announced in September 2024. They requested to remain anonymous, as they are not permitted to speak publicly, but Business Insider has verified their employment.\n\n\"A lot of parents previously were told they can leave around 2 p.m. to pick up school-age kids and can finish the day at home,\" said one of the sales employees.\n\nMiller's email meant having to \"rearrange the home life to accommodate, yet another, Dell change in policy,\" the person said.\n\nSince November, sales leaders have clarified that there are no exemptions for children's school schedules, the two sales employees told Business Insider. They said the office is now fuller throughout the day.\n\nAre you a Dell employee with insight to share?

    "description": "Nike's new CEO, Elliott Hill, made significant moves in 2025 to turn around the struggling sportswear brand, including a shake-up of its leadership.",
    "fullText": "Nike CEO Elliott Hill inherited an uphill battle when he took over at the sports giant in October 2024.\n\nSince then, Hill has made changes — both big and small — to the company as part of its turnaround strategy. After retiring from Nike in 2020, the former president of consumer and marketplace returned to guide the company amid declining sales, sluggish growth, and increased pressure from upstart rivals.\n\nDuring the quarter preceding Hill's start, Nike's revenue declined 10% year over year to $11.6 billion, following flat growth in the 2024 fiscal year. Nike shares jumped about 8% on the day Hill's appointment was announced in September.\n\nThe Nike veteran didn't waste time launching his strategy when he took the helm, reevaluating the existing practices and adjusting them as needed.\n\n\"We lost our obsession with sport,\" Hill said on a December 2024 earnings call. \"Moving forward, we will lead with sport and put the athlete at the center of every decision.\"\n\nLast week, during the company’s most recent quarter, Hill told investors that the comeback \"won't be a straight line.\"\n\nHere's what Hill has been up to in 2025.\n\nNike's \"win now\" strategy — Hill described it on last week's earnings call as Nike's \"immediate response to our biggest challenges and opportunities\" — focuses on five key areas: culture, product, marketing, marketplace, and in-person presence.\n\nThe plan leans on a sports-driven reset that has \"realigned\" about 8,000 employees around its core sports categories, the company said. Those categories include running, basketball, football, and training, as well as sportswear.\n\nThe idea is to put the athlete \"at the center of everything that we do,\" Hill said in a March earnings call.\n\nThe running category is leading the effort and reflects the direction Hill is steering the company. Nike said its running business grew by more than 20% last quarter, which ended in November, marking the second consecutive period of comparable growth.\n\nHill shook up Nike's leadership this year.\n\nIn May, he restructured its consumer, product, and brand leadership to focus on three areas: consumer and sport, marketing, and product creation. As part of that overhaul, Nike's former president of consumer, product, and brand retired, and Hill promoted four other Nike insiders to senior roles reporting to him: president of Nike (Amy Montagne), chief innovation, design, and product officer (Phil McCartney), chief marketing officer (Nicole Graham), and chief growth initiatives officer (Tom Clarke).\n\nHill also hired a new communications chief this year, Michael Gonda.\n\nAnd he made another round of changes in December, eliminating the roles of chief technology officer and chief commercial officer. At the same time, Nike established the role of chief operating officer, which reports to Hill. The new job's function is to \"integrate technology more seamlessly into our sport offense,\" Hill said in a note to employees that Nike released publicly. Venkatesh Alagirisamy, a 20-year veteran of Nike, transitioned into the role on December 8.\n\nAs part of the shake-up, general managers in all regions now report directly to Hill.\n\n\"It's clear how important it is to stay closely connected to what's happening on the ground, from intern to CEO, and every role I've held in between, I've felt that way,\" Hill said on last week's earnings call.\n\nHill said Nike's ties with wholesalers such as Foot Locker and Dick's Sporting Goods had frayed amid its aggressive shift toward direct-to-consumer sales.\n\nSince Hill's return, he said he's been mending those relationships. For example, Nike is back on Amazon and has struck partnerships with smaller retailers, such as Urban Outfitters and Aritzia.\n\nNike's wholesale revenues increased 8% year over year to $7.5 billion during its most recent quarter, which ended November 30.\n\nHill said that Nike would strive to provide a more \"elevated\" experience for consumers, speaking in a January interview with Fortune. He said Nike had become \"too promotional\" on its own site.\n\n\"Being premium also means full price,\" Hill told Fortune. \"We'll focus on promotions during traditional retail moments, not at the consistent levels we are today.\"\n\nHe said in March that Nike Digital, which includes its website and app, ran zero promotions in North America in January and February, down from over 30 during the same months in 2024. The cutback on promotions came alongside \"surgical\" price increases Nike made to mitigate tariffs in 2025.\n\nNike's 68,000-square-foot House of Innovation is the blueprint for its stores. It's a six-story flagship store that opened in 2018, showcasing the company's most advanced products. The first floor is dedicated to running, and the rest of the sprawling store is organized by sport, gender, and age.\n\nHill has frequently pointed to the revamped store in his first year as a model for Nike's move to sports-driven retail layouts.\n\n\"It's an immersive sport experience, and the refresh has already led to double-digit revenue increases,\" Hill told investors in September.\n\nNike did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "Solomon also said that the smartest person won't necessarily succeed at Goldman Sachs.",
    "fullText": "If you ask Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, there are some things you can't teach.\n\nSolomon was asked on a recent episode of Sequoia Capital's \"Long Strange Trip\" podcast about the \"slope versus experience\" debate that's popular in Silicon Valley: the notion that founders are hiring young, bright, high slope people over candidates who have been around the corporate block.\n\nIn the more traditional Wall Street world, Solomon said that experience is worth a whole lot, particularly because it breeds good judgment.\n\n\"Hugely underrated. By the way, hugely necessary, and a big differentiator for the firm,\" Solomon said on the December 18 episode. \"You can't teach experience. That doesn't mean somebody without experience can't do very, very well.\"\n\nExperience and the associated judgment matter most when a company is facing challenges, Solomon said.\n\n\"They're not 90-10 judgements. They're 51-49 judgments,\" Solomon said.\n\nGoldman is no stranger to hiring young talent — Solomon said on the podcast that of the firm's 49,000 employees, around 50% of them are in their twenties. (There were 48,300 employees employed at the firm as of September 30, according to Goldman's third-quarter earnings report.) Yet when hiring people, young or old, Solomon said he doesn't just look for the smartest applicants.\n\n\"I'm in the camp of smart enough. You have to be smart enough, but the smartest person in the world without a whole package of other things — not going to navigate Goldman Sachs well,\" he said.\n\nSofter skills, like the ability to connect with others, resilience, and determination, are necessary to succeed, Solomon added. He has previously said that grit and determination are key for young applicants who want to differentiate themselves in a hugely competitive hiring pool, and two Goldman partners told Business Insider that relationship-building is especially important in the AI era.",

    "description": "Entering 2026, managers to watch include giants with new products like Point72 and players making a name for themselves, like Ning Jin's Avantyr.",
    "fullText": "A year that began with artificial intelligence jitters and geopolitical-driven sell-offs is ending with equity markets near record highs, thanks to the continued growth of the world's biggest tech companies.\n\nFor many hedge funds trading these markets, 2025 was a choppy but ultimately strong year. While few funds have been able to match the returns of the S&P 500, the average manager was up 10.7% through November, according to industry data tracker PivotalPath.\n\nIn many ways, the $5 trillion industry is at a crossroads. Hedge funds are more institutionalized than ever, grappling with soaring talent costs, an arms race in technology and AI, and the pressure to deliver market-beating returns from the world's largest pools of capital.\n\nWith that in mind, here are the 10 hedge funds to watch in 2026. There is no particular order to the list, but those selected are managers who, for one reason or another, the industry is talking about. That means new launches from pedigreed founders, evolving titans, struggling upstarts, and more.\n\nThe firms below declined to comment.\n\nPhilippe Laffont's long-running Tiger Cub, Coatue Management, is bigger than ever before and more publicly visible than ever before. The $70 billion firm, long a player in the secretive world of Silicon Valley venture investing, has opened up access to smaller investors with at least $50,000 to invest in a new fund that counts OpenAI and Stripe as significant positions. This year, the firm's executives, including Laffont and his brother, Thomas, have been a constant presence on industry podcasts, conference panels, and CNBC, and the manager is publishing daily, public research notes called C:/Takes.\n\nIt's a significant departure from the insular style hedge funds typically operate with, but it has not slowed the firm's performance. The flagship hedge is up more than 13% through November, a person familiar with the manager's returns told Business Insider.\n\nBobby Jain's firm was one of the industry's biggest launches ever and certainly one of the buzziest. When Jain Global started trading in mid-2024, it immediately began trading different asset classes around the world and competing with industry stalwarts for talent and capital.\n\nEighteen months later, the firm's net performance has lagged its multistrategy peers. A person familiar with the firm's returns said Jain has produced gross gains in the mid-teens since launch, but fees associated with building a new firm from scratch and hiring dozens of investors, tech workers, and risk managers have reduced the end performance to less than 4%. Additionally, the manager, which now runs close to $6 billion, did not immediately start deploying all of its capital, so potential gains were muted as PMs were onboarded.\n\nThe three-year mark, by which many new launches are judged, is still more than a year away, but given the prominence of the launch, there'll be plenty of attention on the end results for Jain in 2026. The manager now has more than 400 employees across five offices and was able to raise $600 million for a bank loan insurance fund run by former D.E. Shaw investor Syril Pathmanathan earlier this year.\n\nSteve Cohen will always be known as a stockpicker, even if he is no longer trading a book for his firm, Point72. It's how he made his name and first billions in finance, and it's what Point72's bread-and-butter still is in many ways. The firm is even starting another equities unit in 2026 to give its portfolio managers more access to top corporate executives.\n\nBut the firm has continued to branch out and diversify. The manager's macro buildout and venture bets are well-known, and, more recently, Point72 launched a dedicated fund for investing in AI and plans to start a $1 billion private credit fund. The firm's quant arm, Cubist, meanwhile, is under new leadership, and people close to the manager told Business Insider that Cohen has told investors that commodities may be the next area of expansion.\n\nWhile launches from a new member of the Tiger Cub family, one of the big multistrategy funds, or even an OpenAI researcher might garner more press, Harvey Capital is the type of hedge fund that could scale quickly.\n\nFounded by King Street Capital partner Paul Goldschmid, Harvey will invest in credit globally and across different complexes and situations. Named after Goldschmid's father, the New York-based manager began trading earlier in the fourth quarter with $1 billion in assets.\n\nAllocators are interested in the steady returns offered by credit funds. Capital flexibility is most critical for credit investors in today's markets as funds need the \"ability to take advantage of opportunities regardless of external conditions,\" according to a recent JPMorgan Asset Management report. For example, distressed-only investors, the report stated, could struggle in certain environments given the \"episodic\" nature of the space.\n\nMore data is better than less. That's part of the pitch for potential investors in CenterBook Partners, a quasi-new-age fund of funds that partners with external managers and selects the best ideas from their portfolios for its own. Started by former Lone Pine executive and Conatus Capital founder David Stemerman in 2023, the firm is up 5.6% this year through November in its main fund and now manages $1.3 billion, a person close to the manager said.\n\nWithin many multistrategy giants, alpha capture has been a significant moneymaker, as a centralized quant team can craft an efficient portfolio, known as a center book, based on the trades and holdings of the dozens of internal teams within their firms. Stemerman and his team are hoping to replicate that return stream, but without the high cost of hiring their own legions of portfolio managers.\n\nPotentially the biggest industry story of 2025 was Millennium selling a stake. The massive firm was valued at $14 billion in the transaction, and, while there's no timeline for founder Izzy Englander to step down, Millennium has built a deep leadership bench ready to take the reins when the billionaire does.\n\nBut it hasn't been completely smooth sledding this year for the firm. The manager lost money during the chaotic period in the spring when President Donald Trump implemented his tariffs. More recently, one of the behemoth's favorite trades, index rebalancing, was hit hard, resulting in November losses in the hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nThe industry's biggest employer enters 2026 with more capital and people than ever and an eye on new private-market strategies.\n\nThe young startup is a mix of a data science company and an investing platform, but big names are certainly interested in what it has to offer. Investors in the firm include macro investing legend Paul Tudor Jones, and Numerai made a deal with JPMorgan's alternative asset management arm this year to give the bank $500 million in capacity.\n\nRight now, the firm manages $550 million, according to a person close to the firm, a total that does not include JPMorgan's capital and is 10 times what Numerai ran in 2021. The firm first launched as a data science competition in 2015 and evolved from there.\n\nThe firm still runs a global competition for data scientists who submit stock market signals to the company. Numerai, which was valued at $500 million in a fundraising round in November, then uses a proprietary AI to blend the signals together into a cohesive strategy that trades global stocks.\n\nThe goal, according to founder and CEO Richard Craib, is to create \"the world's last hedge fund.\" Through November, the fund is up 6.9%, the person close to Numerai said. In 2024, the fund was up 25.5%, its best year on record.\n\nThe Paris-based quant turns 35 next year, but its expansion in recent years has the industry's chattering class abuzz.\n\nPerformance has to do with part of it. CFM's largest fund, Stratus, is up 6.5% through November, according to a person close to the manager, and the firm returned $2 billion to investors after hitting $21 billion in assets earlier this year.\n\nBut an academic, collaborative culture that has drawn doctorates and AI researchers to the firm is also catching the industry's eye. The manager's headcount has gone from 260 in 2020 to roughly 450 today, and CFM opened a new office in Toronto this year.\n\n\"We want to win, but not at the cost of having a work environment that's not sustainable,\" said the firm's president, Philippe Jordan, in an interview with Business Insider earlier this year.\n\nScale is more important than ever in hedge-fund land, but a smaller investment platform decided 2025 was the time to dive into the talent war headfirst. New Holland, which manages $6.8 billion, had been known for investing in emerging funds, and the New York-based firm is active in the space.\n\nBut this year brought the launch of the firm's internal investing platform, called Plum Island Partners, headed by former North Rock executive Omar Qaiser. The focus, the firm said in a note about the new unit, will still be on niche, capacity-constrained strategies — now talent can choose between taking capital and setting up their own shop or coming in-house.\n\n\"We're trying to be indifferent — we want to find good talent and have a home for them,\" said New Holland CEO Scott Radke in an interview with Business Insider about the unit earlier this year.\n\nThe latest Viking Global executive to start his own fund, Ning Jin's new firm has assembled a day-one team with serious pedigrees. Among the investing team are veterans from Coatue, Tourbillon, Blackstone, KKR, and other notable firms.\n\nIt's been a challenge for founders to launch a new fund without accepting money via a separately managed account, which often gives allocators more transparency into a fund and can be a more burdensome operationally for a new launch. Only big names are able to raise significant capital without accepting SMA money, and, according to people close to Avantyr, Jin's new manager falls in that category, with $1.5 billion in the firm's commingled fund.\n\nThe firm started trading in the fourth quarter.",

He's been working a lot trying to talk to players as well.\"\n\nSalford Red Devils were wound up on 3 December after a turbulent year, with a mass player exodus, late wage payments, heavy defeats and ultimately the loss of their Super League status for 2026.\n\nThe High Court decision ended the 152-year-old club but hopes were quickly raised that a phoenix club could be able to enter the second-tier Championship in 2026.\n\nA consortium with former Salford chief executive Chris Irwin was also in the running to lead the new club and the RFL said they hoped the unsuccessful parties could work alongside Caton-Brown's group in a \"mutually beneficial way\".\n\n\"The quality of proposals we received reflects the strength of commitment to rugby league in Salford,\" said RFL interim chief executive officer Abi Ekoku.\n\n\"Our decision, which could not have been made without the clarity and support of Salford City Council and its stadium management team (CosCos), has been taken with the long-term interests of the club, the local community at its heart and the sport of rugby league as a whole.\"",

    "fullText": "This year has brought us many brilliant video games – but as wealth continues to concentrate, and games are used to exert economic and political influence, we need to keep an eye on the top players\n\nI love playing video games, but what interests me most as a journalist are the ways in which games intersect with real life. One of the joys of spending 20 years on this beat has been meeting hundreds of people whose lives have been meaningfully enhanced by games, and as their cultural influence has grown, these stories have become more and more plentiful.\n\nThere is another side to this, however. A couple of decades ago, video games were mostly either ignored or vilified by governments and mainstream culture, leading to an underdog mentality that has persisted even as games have become a nearly $200bn industry. As their popularity has grown, so have their political and cultural relevance. And the ways in which games intersect with real life are now coloured by the economic and political realities of our times.\n\nWhen I look back on this year’s happenings in the world of games, I see a lot of positives. A theme of the past few years has been comparatively small-scale games outperforming expensive blockbusters: the best examples this year have been the now multi-award-winning Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and Hollow Knight: Silksong, which has sold seven million copies. Despite year-long discussions over the finer points of what counts as “indie” and how many people really contribute to games made by “tiny” teams – a lot of them use contractors, who deserve to be acknowledged – the point remains that it is very possible to make brilliant and creative games to extremely high standards without a $100m budget, and that is something to be celebrated.\n\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 was also (finally) announced and released this year, and has been very well received despite Trump’s best efforts to scupper its launch with tariff drama. Having a new console to enjoy tends to revive one’s enthusiasm for games, and though the Switch 2 didn’t feel enormously different from the original Switch, when I go back to my old machine now I really feel the difference.\n\nBut the broader story of 2025 is of a games industry reckoning with the same late-capitalist, techno-feudalistic forces that are threatening every creative industry. Wealth continues to concentrate at the top, while workers continue to face huge instability: more than 5,000 games industry jobs have been lost this year, and have several studios, including Monolith Productions. AI disruption is everywhere, meanwhile, as companies try to force their workforces to justify immense investments in the as-yet-unprofitable technology. AI-generated artwork and voiceovers have made their way into some of this year’s more successful games, and the pushback has been vociferous.\n\nAll this has led to much greater visibility for video game workers’ unions. In March, United Videogame Workers formed in the US and Canada, part of the Communications Workers of America. (They could be found protesting outside the Game Awards earlier this month.) In the UK, the firing of 30 staff from Rockstar Games pushed the UK’s IWGB Game Workers Union into the spotlight. Unionisation is slowly becoming more common even in the US, where there is not a strong culture of workplace organisation.\n\nAnother theme of the past few years has been consolidation: when Microsoft acquired Activision in 2023, it made me feel very uneasy about the concentration of economic power. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) has been buying its way into the games industry for years via esports partnerships and companies such as Savvy Games Group and Scopely, but this year it was kicked into high gear by a $55bn deal for EA. The Saudis also bought Niantic, makers of Pokémon Go, in March. (If you are wondering why the PIF is quite so ethically troubling, and how these video game investments form part of a strategy to whitewash the country’s image and that of its royal family, Eurogamer’s interview with Human Rights Watch from earlier this year is an essential read.)\n\nWhat we see here is money and power concentrating in the video game world in the same way as in the wider world. And games have immense power to influence people’s thoughts and attitudes: the most powerful people in the world have started to realise this. (Even Elon Musk sees the value of appropriating game credibility: he was discovered to be a fake gamer in January after boasting about his Path of Exile 2 character online.) Why else would the Trump administration be tweeting AI-generated images of the president as Halo’s Master Chief? Or using Pokémon and Halo memes to recruit for ICE? Why else would rightwing agitators continue to feed culture war spats over a black samurai in Assassin’s Creed, or a non-binary actor in a PlayStation game?\n\nI don’t pretend to be neutral on any of these things. Earlier this year, after I wrote about the Saudi acquisition of EA, I got an email from a reader asking if “some of this stuff is more editorial opinion rather than fact/news”. The answer to that is: it’s both. I will never report anything here that isn’t true, but I also won’t shy away from delivering my informed opinion on the things that go on in the gaming world. Unsurprisingly for a Guardian journalist, my values are inclusive, left-leaning and somewhat sceptical of corporate power, and of course that informs what I write in Pushing Buttons. I think that those values are vital context in these times.\n\nPlaying games is something a lot of us do for escapism, and a lot of people still react defensively if you talk about their relevance to real-world politics. Don’t we play games to get away from this stuff? Can’t we just concentrate on the hundreds of fantastic games that come out every single year, from creatively fired-up developers and artists all over the world? But games are inextricable from what’s happening in the real world. All art is. As if to symbolise this, this year’s Summer Game Fest – a showcase of forthcoming games held in LA in June – was interrupted by city-wide LA protests against ICE.\n\nIt matters, who has power. Games feel so exciting because they often give so much power to their players, to carve their own paths though their worlds. As players we leave an impression on games, and they leave an impression on us. In an ideal world, players and developers would be the people who held the power in the video games industry, too. If we enjoy video games, it is worth keeping an eye on the biggest players.",

    "fullText": "Journalists find Swiss government rejected company over fears US intelligence might gain access to sensitive data\n\nUK MPs have raised concerns about the government’s contracts with Palantir after an investigation published in Switzerland highlighted allegations about the suitability and security of its products.\n\nThe investigation by the Zurich-based research collective WAV and the Swiss online magazine Republik details Palantir’s efforts, over the course of seven years, to sell its products to Swiss federal agencies.\n\nPalantir is a US company that provides software to integrate and analyse data scattered across different systems, such as in the health service. It also provides artificial intelligence-enabled military targeting systems.\n\nThe investigation cites an expert report, internal to the Swiss army, that assessed Palantir’s status as a US company meant there was a possibility sensitive data shared with it could be accessed by the US government and intelligence services.\n\nBritish MPs have voiced concerns over the US data company in light of the report.\n\n“Palantir … is an organisation that the British government, in terms of the NHS, in terms of contracts, should stay very far away from … I think the Swiss army is right to be suspicious,” said the Labour MP Clive Lewis.\n\nThe government “needs to undertake transparent due diligence” on the conduct of Palantir and other big tech companies, said Rachael Maskell, the MP for York Central.\n\n“I know there were certainly questions in the NHS about Palantir’s capabilities. It’s clearly been handed a lot of money to do the federated data platform. I, as a politician, want to know that these companies are making ethical choices. And if they’re not – whether around weaponry, minerals or the climate – I think we as parliament should be given greater transparency around this.”\n\nThe year-long investigation is based on freedom of information requests to Swiss government departments. It details how Palantir went on a seven-year “shopping trip” trying to convince Swiss authorities to use its products and was rejected at least nine times by different agencies.\n\nIn response to a query from the Guardian, a Palantir spokesperson said: “There is no basis to the claim in the report by the Swiss army about potential access to sensitive data and no truth to it whatsoever.\n\n“We run a business that is predicated on the trust of our customers, which means we also do everything possible – from contractual, procedural, to technical controls – to ensure that our customers are in full control of their data, their operations and their decisions when using Palantir software.”\n\nIn 2020, in the early days of the pandemic, Palantir pitched its services to Swiss health authorities – while touting its work with the NHS, which had just begun to use its tools to manage Covid-19 data.\n\n“We are already doing this in other countries, such as Great Britain, but we feel a special obligation to Switzerland and the federal chancellor,” it wrote.\n\nSwitzerland’s Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) ultimately chose not to work with Palantir in managing the pandemic. The exact reasons for this were redacted: it hired a competitor instead. In meeting minutes obtained by the journalists, the office stated: “Problem: Communications. FOPH demands that Palantir be questioned.”\n\nAt the same time, Palantir was trying to win contracts with the Swiss army. These meetings began in 2018. In 2020, it submitted a bid for the “IT system of the army’s intelligence service” and was rejected for unspecified reasons.\n\nIn 2024, it tried again. By this time, the UK’s Ministry of Defence had signed its first £75m contract with Palantir for data tools. After a meeting between Palantir’s European head and a Swiss army commander, the army commissioned an internal report to evaluate the products Palantir was offering.\n\nThat report, authored by army experts, concluded that it remained unclear – based on their information about Palantir’s products – whether or not US intelligence would be able to access data shared with Palantir as it was a US company, despite Palantir’s official reassurances otherwise.\n\nThe finding is “explosive”, wrote the journalists. “Firstly, because it comes from a high-ranking body of the army and, secondly, because the Swiss Federal Department of Defence (VBS) employs certified cryptologists.”\n\nExperts in the Swiss army also found other issues with Palantir’s offerings to the military, both in terms of its cost and the fact that using Palantir’s technologies might require Palantir specialists to be permanently onsite, which could “limit the army’s ability to act in crisis situations”.\n\nThe Swiss army decided not to contract Palantir. Less than a year after it commissioned the report, the UK military would sign a £750m deal with Palantir to “boost military AI and innovation”.\n\nWAV and Republik’s findings have generated debate across Europe, especially in Germany. The head of Germany’s domestic intelligence service, Sinan Selen, warned European security services to be cautious in any use of US software in public comments last week without naming Palantir specifically.\n\nSeveral German states including Bavaria, Hesse and Baden-Württemberg in recent months have chosen Palantir analysis software for their police forces or, as is the case with North Rhine-Westphalia, paved a legal path toward using it or comparable services.\n\nThe MP Konstantin von Notz, an intelligence expert with the opposition Greens and former head of Germany’s parliamentary oversight committee for the secret services, has been vocal in his opposition to Palantir.\n\nIn an emailed statement to the Guardian after the Swiss revelations, Von Notz underlined his view that the German interior minister, Alexander Dobrindt, who has said he is reviewing whether to allow police across the country to use the US software, “must finally say goodbye to Palantir”.\n\nVon Notz welcomed the Swiss decision to do without the “highly controversial US company which has close ties to Donald Trump”.",

    "title": "Are Cell Phones to Blame for the Youth Loneliness Epidemic?",
    "description": "David Landes, Kimberly...",
    "fullText": "David Landes argues that cell phones represent an isolated life whereas Kimberly Hassel blames the loneliness crisis on a society unable to support or protect its youth.\n\nCell phones are to blame for the youth loneliness crisis—but not in the way you might think. We can’t fault cell phones alone; they are tied up with too many social phenomena for that. But they are emblematic of a way of life—one isolated yet always connected—that so many of us want to escape. Cell phones are portals to monetized digital worlds that depend and feed on loneliness. Teasing out their roles in these complex social dynamics can help us understand how to confront the youth loneliness crisis.\n\nThe prehistory of cell phones provides clues on where to begin. The solitary individual in mass industrial society has long been a research subject of academics and a theme in pop culture. David Riesman’s 1950 sociological study The Lonely Crowd, Francis Ford Coppola’s 1974 film The Conversation, and Sherry Turkle’s 2011 book Alone Together all explore how extending our communicative capacity creates a double bind: We gain something—say, the ability to reach farther and faster—but also lose something, such as memory and in-person conversations. Cell phones accelerate this trend. Astonishing capabilities have been shoehorned into one hand-sized object, but the trade-offs are steep.\n\nYou probably know many of the arguments about how cell phones cause loneliness: the habit-forming, attention-extractive designs; the disembodied digital identities and parasocial relationships; the echo chambers and cultural homogeneity; the hyper-visibility of oneself without control of one’s audience; the data collection and surveillance; the algorithms that determine tastes and fates; the separation from the physical environment; the fleeting consumable pleasures that will never fulfill deeper human needs; and the tech oligopoly’s “enshittification” business model.\n\nBut even these critiques miss something, because we tend to use yesterday’s terms to talk about today’s tech. Our language is awash in the logic of old media: YouTube is like TV; Facebook is like a book. Cell phones are mostly not phones at all; they’re supercomputers that contain an app imitating a phone. We are building our technological world more quickly than we can understand it. To navigate what social media are doing to us, we need to update the language we use.\n\nI study the forms of attention that we use with new media but that we don’t have words for yet. I do this at the Strother School of Radical Attention and at Duke University’s Dialogue Laboratory, where I help students research their phoneless encounters. Together, my students and I examine forms of attention—like those at the root of loneliness, miscommunication, and habit—and try to remake them into practices that yield better alternatives. Through this work, I’ve learned that the youth loneliness crisis, like so much else, flows through our phones, but that simply telling young people to use their phones less is not practical. Phones are the basic infrastructure of our work, leisure, and social lives. So we should ask a more manageable question: In what ways can young people engage with phones so as not to perpetuate the loneliness that phones help create?\n\nSince loneliness is a subjective experience, self-reports make for good starting points. Many people say they want to be on their phones less but feel unable to disconnect individually and also that they relish being in well-designed phone-free spaces. In other words, we want group de-phonification.\n\nWhen we do create these environments, people stop just consuming and start creating experiences together. The key here is attention and using it in the plural: attentions. The attentions used for swiping through TikTok videos are different from the ones you use to talk to a person, write a letter, or contemplate art. The way out of the youth loneliness crisis begins with young people enjoying the types of attention that occur off-screen and then experiencing that with others. This teaches people to see as others see, to listen as others listen.\n\nThese shared attentions create a shared experience, which is natural, fun, and intimate. Kids do it in spontaneous role-playing. We do it with our pets. Interacting with each other through our favorite types of attention is how we create shared worlds and reconnect in new ways—things that cell phones inhibit.\n\nSo how do we reclaim that kind of shared attention in practice? For starters, we can negotiate how we’re allowed to use our phones. In cell-phone stacking, for example, people place their phones in a pile and whoever grabs their phone first pays a consequence, such as picking up the tab for everyone.\n\nIf using a cell phone is like pointing a fire hose at our face, then we are not drowning alone. So many of us are struggling with worlds experienced chiefly through our phones. Let’s use that: Communalizing the struggle against the cell phone can reduce loneliness. If we blame cell phones constructively, we can reengineer the kinds of attention that create what we want and need. Removing or changing technology on its own won’t solve youth loneliness, but generating punkish DIY methods for coming together without screens can.\n\nAs public projects suffer from a lack of funding in the United States, we are seeing a decline of “third places”—locations, such as libraries and parks, that are neither work nor school yet provide opportunities to socialize. Gentrification, rising prices, and the overreliance on cars mean that a simple social outing can burn a hole through our pockets. Overpolicing, gun violence, and the criminalization of youth activities—in which hanging out becomes stigmatized as “loitering”—also work against young people’s efforts to socialize. So who can blame young people for staying home and turning to their devices for social connection? The loneliness epidemic was not caused by cell phones; it is a symptom of late-stage capitalism and a society that is unable to support or protect its youth.\n\nObituary\n\n /\n\n David Klion\n\nI am a sociocultural anthropologist and digital ethnographer who specializes in digital culture, youth culture, and identity in Japan. And my research on young people’s use of social media and cell phones shows that in Japan there are clear conceptions as to what constitutes “proper” or “good” use of digital technologies. There, analog and face-to-face interactions remain privileged over digital ones. Japan has been a leader in mobile communications since the 1990s, and cell phones with Internet have been embedded in the social lives of Japanese youth for decades. This makes Japan a valuable case study in thinking about the perceived relationship between cell phones and the youth loneliness epidemic.\n\nJapan has been facing its own loneliness epidemic for a while and so became a hot spot for the literature on loneliness. Indeed, news and books on solitary death (kodokushi), youth suicide, and Japan as a “relationless society” (muen shakai) emerged in the early 2000s and have proliferated over the years. But the main cause of this epidemic was the bursting of Japan’s bubble economy in the 1990s, which led to a recession and a decline in stable employment.\n\nThose conditions linger, as young people on the cusp of entering the workforce and becoming shakaijin (literally “members of society”) realize that they don’t enjoy the same career paths as the previous generation—such as a lifetime job in a corporation—and instead must navigate a landscape of precarious employment. The demands of securing work create a profound sense of loneliness. The phrase deai ga nai, or the inability to meet people, frequently appeared during my conversations with college graduates. High school and college students, meanwhile, enjoy robust social lives, since their social connections are mediated by their schools.\n\nBefore the Covid-19 pandemic, high schoolers, college students, and postgrads told me that cell phones should supplement in-person social interactions—not replace them. Their views shifted during the pandemic. Because in-person interaction was prohibited, they recalibrated their relationship with the digital. They understood many of the drawbacks of relying on screens for connection, but they also recognized that phones and social media were the key means of finding solidarity during the pandemic. Since then, young people have been using hashtags and platforms to build community. In my research, for example, I have documented how social media has allowed Black Japanese youths to connect with each other and participate in the global movement for racial justice. Social media is crucial in helping people with marginalized identities—for example, queer and trans youth—feel less alone.\n\nClassroom visits in Japan challenged my views on digital sociality and what I—a millennial who grew up in the United States—have taken for granted as “normal” digital practices. Students asked me questions like “Why do Americans show their faces online? Isn’t that dangerous?” and “Why do Americans debate and argue with each other online if it won’t change anything?” One student even commented judgmentally about my screen time (which, admittedly, was excessive). My conversations with young people in Japan show that it is possible to grow up with cell phones and the Internet and still prioritize in-person interactions.\n\nThis is a result of factors such as parenting and Japan’s extensive public-health infrastructure. For example, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has an online portal dedicated to “wise” and “safe” Internet interactions, with scenarios that demonstrate how the digital can negatively affect social connections. When seeing the portal, my students at Duke remarked that they wished they had a similar resource growing up. The US would benefit from developing more educational resources that teach young people media literacy and how to “get along” (tsukiau) with the digital in their lives.\n\nI don’t want to frame Japan as unique or perfect in all this. Japan has its own issues regarding youth mental health. But I do think Americans can learn from Japanese youth. It is hard to be young, especially in the wake of a pandemic. Instead of blaming technology, we can—and should—work toward building the better society that young people deserve.\n\nOver the past year you’ve read Nation writers like Elie Mystal, Kaveh Akbar, John Nichols, Joan Walsh, Bryce Covert, Dave Zirin, Jeet Heer, Michael T.

    "fullText": "Toyota can’t seem to catch a break in court lately. Last month, the company dealt with a $5.7-billion lawsuit over the hydrogen-powered Mirai, with owners saying the car was basically unusable because there’s nowhere to refuel. Now, Toyota’s back in the hot seat, but this time it’s about something significantly more common: automatic transmissions.\n\nThe latest lawsuit was filed this month in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, led by a Camry owner named James LeBoutheller. He says his car’s transmission started acting up, but every time he brought it to the dealer, he was told it was just “normal operation.” Only after things got worse did someone finally find metal shavings in the transmission fluid – a clear sign something inside had failed. By that point, Toyota apparently refused to pay for the full repair.\n\nThe lawsuit claims Toyota kept selling cars with a known transmission defect and didn’t warn buyers about the risk.\n\nThe heart of the issue is Toyota’s UA80 eight-speed automatic. According to the lawsuit, it’s got both a mechanical flaw and software that doesn’t help matters. The result? Too much heat, parts wearing out early, and transmissions that eventually give up. It is said that the transmission is “predisposed to premature failure” due to overheating, degraded fluid, and internal component wear, which may occasionally cause stalling or loss of power.\n\nThe lawsuit covers a wide range of vehicles, including:\n\nToyota Highlander (2017–present)\n\nToyota Grand Highlander (2023–present)\n\nLexus NX 250 / NX 350 (2022–present)\n\nOwners say Toyota tried to quietly fix the problem with service bulletins and behind-the-scenes updates, all while still advertising these cars as reliable.\n\nThis isn’t just a one-off case, either. Earlier this month, another class-action lawsuit popped up in California, asking for about $5 million over the same UA80 transmission. The complaints are almost identical: Toyota knew about the problem, repairs cost a fortune once the warranty runs out, and help from the company is hit or miss.\n\nIn both cases, owners point to online complaints, NHTSA filings, and dealership acknowledgments as evidence that Toyota was well aware of the issue. The Texas lawsuit expands the scope by pushing for nationwide class certification and broader remedies, including warranty extensions or recalls.\n\nWhat happens next is fairly predictable. Toyota is expected to file a motion to dismiss or narrow the claims, while plaintiffs will push for discovery to access internal documents. Whether these cases gain traction or eventually consolidate remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the UA80 transmission isn’t done causing headaches, for owners or for Toyota.\n\nView the 4 images of this gallery on the original article",

    "description": "Clint Crawford has a message for parents who are concerned about the shortage of white-collar entry-level work: open their minds to the possibility of a fulfilling career otherwise.",
    "fullText": "When something breaks—whether it’s the plumbing or a car—the first call most people make is to a blue-collar worker. That was the lesson he wanted his children to understand.\n\nClint Crawford is a 55-year-old automotive technician at Midas Auto and Repair Shop in Arkansas. He has a message for parents who are concerned about the shortage of white-collar entry-level work: open their minds to the possibility of a fulfilling career elsewhere.\n\nLike the conversation Ford CEO Jim Farley described having at his own dinner table with his son, Crawford believes it should be a debate—one that needs to happen at dinner tables across the country.\n\n“They need to be introduced to alternatives, and we need to place an equal importance on technical programs,” he asserts.\n\nCrawford has a 22-year-old daughter and a 21-year-old son. Both went to college, but it wasn’t expected of them as the default while growing up, as he worked to emphasize the dignity and stability that comes with blue-collar careers.\n\n“If something happens with the plumbing, the first call is either the landlord or the plumber,” Crawford tells Fortune, adding that when a car breaks down, the first call goes to a repair shop.\n\n“The first call that most people are going to make is to that blue-collar worker.”\n\nThose were the examples he gave his children when counseling them on what career to pursue, believing that such workers are essential to the running of the economy and to the smooth functioning of everyday life.\n\n“That way, they could understand that there are options,” Crawford says.\n\nHe also urged his children to be realistic, something many parents can now relate to. While the majority of parents still prefer a four-year college education for their children, a new survey from American Student Assistance found that 35% believe some form of technical education or a blue-collar career may be better suited for their child. In 2019, that figure was 13%.\n\nAnd it makes sense. Most white-collar entry-level jobs require a college degree, which has become a severe economic burden for younger generations. According to a 2024 report by the Education Data Initiative, the average Gen Zer has $22,948 of student loan debt. In addition, companies have reduced their rates of hiring entry-level employees, in part due to tariff disruptions as well as AI automating some of these early work experiences.\n\nCrawford himself was concerned when his son decided to study data science, having heard—like many others—about struggles in hiring. But he realized that “it’s something that he enjoys, and he’s good at. And so computer science it is.”\n\nIdeally, Crawford believes schools and parents should start these types of conversations early on. For his kids, they decided college was, in fact, right for them. But they had a conversation, which he encourages others to have.\n\nFor Crawford’s family, career discussions took place before his kids earned college degrees, and he encouraged his kids to be practical.\n\n“I think a lot of times parents are telling their kids, you know, do what makes you happy.” That’s great, he says, but adds that “the reason we work is to pay bills.” If a worker can’t do that or is underpaid, “it just seems pointless.”\n\nCrawford believes people should consider these jobs as valid options that offer stability—something that seems hard-won these days. Young people should be offered aptitude tests to help determine what kind of work best aligns with their skills. When someone is good at math, he believes they should be encouraged to pursue blue-collar careers that require highly logical and math-heavy processes.\n\nCrawford has found that electricians are “incredibly math-oriented” and that liking math doesn’t mean you have to be a mathematician.\n\n“There are plenty of opportunities out there that require a strong background in math that don’t limit you to teaching math at the high school or college level,” he adds.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "description": "\"There is larger uncertainty.\"",
    "fullText": "Researchers have introduced a new temperature dataset that incorporates nearly seven more decades of climate data. Scientists said this more complete picture of our world's climate could reshape how we understand the total human impact on our planet's climate system.\n\n\"It changes our perception of how far we have already pushed the climate system in important ways,\" Peter Thorne, a Maynooth University professor and ICARUS Climate Research Centre director, told CNN.\n\nThe groundbreaking temperature dataset was recently released by a team of scientists based in the United Kingdom. It incorporates climate data dating back to 1781, further into the past than most conventional datasets. Scientists usually measure modern climate change using datasets that begin in 1850, the benchmark behind estimates of nearly 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming.\n\nThe new dataset, referred to as GloSAT, indicates that heat-trapping gases rose by 2.5% between 1750 and 1850, possibly responsible for more warming than previously thought. GloSAT suggests humans are responsible for 0.09 degrees Celsius of warming over the 100-year period.\n\nA second study published last month in the Institute of Physics journal Environmental Research Letters estimates that an additional 0.1 to 0.2 degrees Celsius of warming was caused by early increases in carbon dioxide.\n\n\"Climate simulations of the industrial era typically start in 1850, using the first 50 years as a baseline for 'preindustrial' climate,\" according to the authors of the study. \"However, the period immediately prior to 1850 is of particular interest due to early human influence and heightened volcanic activity, the latter of which led to cooler global temperatures than those observed in the subsequent historical period.\"\n\n\"As the authors themselves make clear, there is larger uncertainty prior to 1850,\" commented Thorne. \"But it is cooler; it's undoubtedly cooler.\" The climate scientist cautions that we need to carefully consider the implications of these findings.\n\nGloSAT indicates the planet was far cooler from the late 1700s through 1849 than during the 1850-1900 preindustrial baseline, in part due to cooling from two major early-1800s volcanic eruptions.\n\nWhile the data shows more warming than once thought, scientists said it doesn't alter climate targets or hasten expected impacts.\n\n\"It does mean we warmed the Earth more, but it doesn't mean the impacts are suddenly going to occur sooner,\" Thorne added, per CNN. \"They are where they are. And they've almost invariably been calculated relative to a much more recent reference period.\"\n\nIn Thorne's view, the research fits into a broader picture that points to rising concern over worsening impacts. \"It changes our perception of how far we have already pushed the climate system in important ways,\" he explained.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's global climate report uses the conventional 176-year record that begins in 1850. The agency's global climate report for November revealed that with an average temperature of 1.18 degrees Celsius (2.12 Fahrenheit) above average for the first 11 months of this year, there is a 99.9% chance that 2025 will rank among the five warmest years on record.\n\nDo you worry about having toxic forever chemicals in your home?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nUsually, when something gets warmed up, heat tends to spread outward before eventually dissipating. But things are a little different in the world of superfluid quantum gas.\n\nFor the first time, MIT scientists have successfully imaged how heat actually travels in a wave, known as a “second sound,” through this exotic fluid.\n\nUnderstanding this dynamic could help answer questions about high-temperature superconductors and neutron stars.\n\nIn the world of average, everyday materials, heat tends to spread out from a localized source. Drop a burning coal into a pot of water, and that liquid will slowly rise in temperature before its heat eventually dissipates. But the world is full of rare, exotic materials that don’t exactly play by these thermal rules.\n\nInstead of spreading out as one would expect, these superfluid quantum gasses “slosh” heat side to side—it essentially propagates as a wave. Scientists call this behavior a material’s “second sound” (the first being ordinary sound via a density wave). Although this phenomenon has been observed before, it’s never been imaged. But recently, scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) were finally able to capture this movement of pure heat by developing a new method of thermography (a.k.a. heat-mapping).\n\nThe results of this study were published in the journal Science, and in an university press release highlighting the achievement, MIT assistant professor and co-author Richard Fletcher continued the boiling pot analogy to describe the inherent strangeness of “second sound” in these exotic superfluids.\n\n“It’s as if you had a tank of water and made one half nearly boiling,” Fletcher said. “If you then watched, the water itself might look totally calm, but suddenly the other side is hot, and then the other side is hot, and the heat goes back and forth, while the water looks totally still.”\n\nThese superfluids are created when a cloud of atoms is subjected to ultra-cold temperatures approaching absolute zero (−459.67 °F). In this rare state, atoms behave differently, as they create an essentially friction-free fluid. It’s in this frictionless state that heat has been theorized to propagate like a wave.\n\n“Second sound is the hallmark of superfluidity, but in ultracold gases so far you could only see it in this faint reflection of the density ripples that go along with it,” lead author Martin Zwierlein said in a press statement. “The character of the heat wave could not be proven before.”\n\nTo finally capture this second sound in action, Zweierlein and his team had to think outside the usual thermal box, as there’s a big problem trying to track heat of an ultracold object—it doesn’t emit the usual infrared radiation. So, MIT scientists designed a way to leverage radio frequencies to track certain subatomic particles known as “lithium-6 fermions,” which can be captured via different frequencies in relation to their temperature (i.e. warmer temperatures mean higher frequencies, and vice versa). This novel technique allowed the researchers to essentially zero in on the “hotter” frequencies (which were still very much cold) and track the resulting second wave over time.\n\nThis might feel like a big “so what?” After all, when’s the last time you had a close encounter with a superfluid quantum gas? But ask a materials scientist or astronomer, and you’ll get an entirely different answer.\n\nWhile exotic superfluids may not fill up our lives (yet), understanding the properties of second wave movement could help questions regarding high-temperature superconductors (again, still at very low temperatures) or the messy physics that lie at the heart of neutron stars.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

Investors have just become choosier about which players might emerge as winners heading into 2026.\n\nTech (XLK) stocks have been on a rollercoaster recently as concerns over funding for Oracle (ORCL) data centers and construction delays from CoreWeave (CRWV) rattled AI plays.\n\n\"I do believe these are all hyper-valid concerns for the theme, and with the market now breaking out the 'scrutiny scalpel' we are finally seeing appropriate 'winners and losers' dispersion, and that's a good thing,\" Nomura Securities equity derivatives analyst Charlie McElligott wrote in a note on Thursday.\n\nHowever, Micron Technology's (MU) blockbuster results sparked a rebound in AI trades. The memory chipmaker beat Wall Street estimates on Q1 revenue and EPS, helped by AI-fueled demand.\n\nMcElligott compared Micron's earnings' \"upside shock\" to Nvidia's (NVDA) results in May 2023, which acted as a catalyst for the broader AI boom.\n\n\"Point-being, there is still blood left in this AI stone,\" McElligott wrote.\n\nInvestors have been watching for potential funding risks within the AI trade after Oracle stock fell following a Financial Times report that Blue Owl Capital would not support Oracle's $10 billion data center project.\n\nThe concerns are particularly notable given the market concentration among the largest tech companies in the S&P 500 (^GSPC).\n\nGoldman Sachs analysts forecast S&P 500 earnings growth of over 12% in 2026, largely driven by the top seven stocks in the index. Those include Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Broadcom (AVGO), and Meta (META). Together, they account for roughly a quarter of the index's earnings.\n\nMeanwhile, the \"Magnificent 7\" tech players are up an average of 21% this year, compared with a 16% gain for the S&P 500, according to Yahoo Finance data.\n\nSevens Report Research founder Tom Essaye told Yahoo Finance he expects to see winners and losers within the group heading into next year.\n\n\"I think we're going to see some pretty massive bifurcation,\" Essaye said.\" The next evolution of this trade, where there are going to be winners and losers within the Mag 7.\"\n\nHe said that his favorite stock is Alphabet because of the growth prospects for Google's Gemini artificial intelligence product.\n\n\"I think companies like Oracle that are not overextended financially, but are sort of raising eyebrows with a lot of the spending that AI, I think that companies like that could struggle,\" he added.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is losing what author Michael Wolff calls “reflex control,” and no one in his inner circle is willing to offer an honest assessment of his capabilities. This, Wolff claims, is leading the president to become increasingly uninhibited in his public pronouncements.\n\nDiscussing the president’s remarks this week on everything from the tragic murders of Rob Reiner and his wife Michele to the mess the FBI made of first lady Melania Trump’s underwear drawer, Wolff told his Inside Trump’s Head podcast co-host Joanna Coles that Trump is exhibiting a problem of “reflex control.”\n\nWolff also discussed comments made by Trump’s Chief of Staff Susie Wiles in a now-viral Vanity Fair story where she described the president as having an “alcoholic’s personality.”\n\n“Susie Wiles might have just as well said, ‘It’s like dealing with a dementia patient.’ I mean, it is the same thing,” Wolff explained. “And because he doesn’t drink, it is probably closer to that, in which he has the uninhibited aspects of his personality—that might be anger, or self-pity, or in his case racism—become increasingly more uninhibited, and that seems to be what’s going on. He opens his mouth and you go, ‘This is a problem.’”\n\nColes highlighted another example, from September, where Trump took the stage at Charlie Kirk’s memorial service and ranted about how much he hated his enemies. “It’s just peculiar at this stage,” Coles added. “And no one around him seems to be saying, ‘Enough already, you sound deranged.’”\n\n“It’s true, no one around them does say that,” Wolff replied, before going on to discuss the fact that the U.S. has had two octogenarian presidents back-to-back, and few people around former President Joe Biden seemed willing to break ranks and disclose his health concerns to the public.\n\n“Joe Biden had enormous cognitive difficulties, and everyone around him closed ranks to protect him until he could no longer be protected,” Wolff said, adding that there is “no way to diagnose the president.”\n\n“There is no way for us to say, ‘OK, he is experiencing cognitive issues of an alarming variety.’ And no one around him is going to say that. Although Susie Wiles, in acknowledging the alcoholic thing, was curious.”\n\nMedical experts have studied the president’s public speeches and mannerisms, as well as his documented health issues, including chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) and the ever-present bandages on his hand, and concluded that he is in decline and perhaps even exhibiting signs of someone with dementia.\n\nMary Trump, the president’s niece, has echoed these concerns, noting that her grandfather—Trump’s father, Fred Sr.—lived with Alzheimer’s for many years.\n\nThe White House has continued to insist that Trump is in excellent health, even going so far as to claim that the MRI he underwent during his most recent physical exam was standard for patients his age. Medical professionals were quick to dispute this.\n\nThe president has also repeatedly bragged about “acing” three separate cognitive assessments, and has described the elementary school-level tests as being “very hard.”\n\n“He bragged about this,” said Wolff of Trump’s claim of acing the medical assessments, “which is yet another symptom, obviously, a heightened sensitivity to this issue and a defensiveness about it.”\n\n“We have a whole set of symptoms here,” Wolff said of the president. “This idea of a president’s mental health, we don’t really have a context for this, when, in fact, the context should be: this is a paramount issue.”\n\n“Obviously, if the president is unwell, we should discuss that. It actually is an issue, probably, of far greater importance than any other political issue.”\n\nWhen reached for comment, White House Communications Director Steven Cheung replied: “Michael Wolff is a lying sack of s--t and has been proven to be a fraud. He routinely fabricates stories originating from his sick and warped imagination, only possible because he has a severe and debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has rotted his peanut-sized brain.”\n\nFind and New episodes of incomparable insight into the psyche of the world’s most talked-about man drop every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday evening on YouTube and Wednesday and Friday mornings on other podcast platforms.",

    "fullText": "The explosion of a SpaceX rocket put multiple passenger planes in danger, with one pilot declaring “Mayday” before being forced to fly through the debris.\n\nThe experimental rocket ship belonging to Elon Musk’s company disintegrated minutes after lift-off in January, which scattered fiery debris across the Caribbean region, causing widespread disruptions to air traffic.\n\nPilots of the three planes, carrying a total of 450 people, were forced to decide whether to fly through a field of rocket debris or risk running low on fuel over water, according to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) documents.\n\nThe files, which the Wall Street Journal reviewed, revealed the Jan 16 explosion posed a greater danger to planes in the air than was publicly known.\n\nThe explosion rained a meteor-like shower of debris across parts of the Caribbean for about 50 minutes and could have put lives at risk, according to the FAA.\n\nFiery trails shooting through the sky were visible from the cockpits and cabins of commercial aircraft and private jets. If a piece of debris had struck an aircraft in flight, it could have caused severe damage to the plane and possible passenger fatalities.\n\nAll flights eventually landed safely.\n\nThe un-crewed Starship test flight was Musk’s seventh attempt at launching a rocket ship into space in his quest to make life on Mars a reality. Responding to the explosion, the billionaire posted on social media: “Success is uncertain, but entertainment is guaranteed!”\n\nDuring the incident, an air-traffic controller told one of the planes, a JetBlue flight en route to Puerto Rico: “You want to go to San Juan, it’s going to be at your own risk.”\n\nThe other two, a private jet and Iberia Airlines flight, also declared fuel emergencies and travelled through the temporary no-fly zone, the WSJ reported.\n\nA controller in Puerto Rico told pilots they would have to declare an emergency to land at the capital. One pilot responded: “In that case, we declare emergency: Mayday. Mayday, Mayday.”\n\nAir traffic controllers working on the issue had to try to divert planes from the debris areas, increasing their workload and causing a “potential extreme safety risk”, according to one FAA report from an air-traffic facility in New York.\n\nAt least two planes flew too close to each other, requiring a controller to intervene to avoid a collision, according to the documents.\n\nAs well as the extreme safety risk, the FAA recorded that SpaceX failed to call an emergency hotline immediately following the explosion. Controllers in Miami first heard of the explosion from pilots seeing the debris, not from Musk’s company.\n\nSpace X, the world’s busiest rocket launcher, has already launched 11 Starship missions and is planning future flights over Florida, Mexico and North Atlantic aeroplane routes. Starship, which stands at 400ft tall, is the most powerful rocket ever developed, according to the company.\n\nThe explosion alarmed airline industry and US government officials because of its impact on air travel and the growing number of space operations.\n\nThe safety risk of debris is set to keep increasing. The FAA predicts an annual average of 200 to 400 rocket launches or re-entries in the years ahead, compared to 24 operations on average each year between 1989 and 2024.\n\nFollowing the January incident, the agency set up a panel of experts to conduct a safety review to examine how to deal with debris risks from spaceflight failures.\n\nFAA officials suspended the review in August, claiming that most of the safety recommendations were already being implemented. The unusual move surprised the panel members.\n\nSince the January explosion, SpaceX has conducted four more Starship launches, two of which were successful, while two failed.\n\nDuring the test in March, the engines failed shortly after lift-off, leading the rocket to spin out of control and explode mid-air. In May, the rocket spun out of control and broke apart near its intended splashdown location in the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe company plans to launch a new, more powerful version next year. Musk has already predicted there would be problems. He said on a podcast in September he warned that the rocket “might have some initial teething pains because it’s such a radical redesign”.\n\nThe Telegraph has approached SpaceX for comment.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "The leaders of Denmark and Greenland insisted Monday that the U.S. won't take over Greenland and demanded respect for their territorial integrity after President Donald Trump ‍​announced ​the appointment of a ‌special envoy to Greenland.\n\nTrump's announcement on Sunday that Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry would be the U.S. special envoy prompted a new flare-up of tensions over Washington's interest in the vast, semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, a NATO ally. Denmark's foreign minister said in comments to Danish broadcasters that he plans to summon the U.S. ambassador.\n\n”We have said it before. Now, we say it again. National borders and the sovereignty of states are rooted in international law,\" Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and her Greenlandic counterpart, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said in a joint statement. “They are fundamental principles. You cannot annex another country. Not even with an argument about international security.”\n\n“Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders and the U.S. shall not take over Greenland,” they added in the statement, emailed by Frederiksen's office. \"We expect respect for our joint territorial integrity.”\n\nTrump called repeatedly during his presidential transition and the early months of his second term for U.S. jurisdiction over Greenland, and has not ruled out military force to take control of the mineral-rich, strategically located Arctic island. In March, Vice President JD Vance visited a remote U.S. military base in Greenland and accused Denmark of underinvesting there.\n\nThe issue gradually drifted out of the headlines, but in August, Danish officials summoned the U.S. ambassador following a report that at least three people with connections to Trump had carried out covert influence operations in Greenland. Denmark is a NATO ally of the United States.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump announced Landry's appointment as ‌special envoy, saying that “Jeff understands how essential Greenland is to our National Security, and will strongly advance our Country’s Interests for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Allies, and indeed, the World.”\n\nLandry wrote in a post on X that “it’s an honor to serve you in this volunteer position to make Greenland a part of the U.S.”\n\nDanish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said in a brief statement that “the appointment confirms the continued American interest in Greenland.”\n\n\"However, we insist that everyone — including the U.S. — must show respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark,” he added.\n\nDanish broadcasters TV2 and DR reported that in comments from the Faroe Islands later Monday, Løkke Rasmussen said he will call in the U.S. ambassador in Copenhagen, Kenneth Howery, for a meeting at the ministry.\n\nBefore issuing the joint statement with Frederiksen, Nielsen wrote on Facebook that Denmark had again woken up to a new announcement from the U.S. president, but it “does not change anything for us at home.”\n\nEarlier this month, the Danish Defense Intelligence Service said in an annual report that the U.S. is using its economic power to “assert its will” and threaten military force against friend and foe alike.\n\nDenmark is a member of the European Union as well as NATO.\n\nAnouar El Anouni, a spokesperson for the EU's executive Commission, told reporters in Brussels Monday that it wasn't for him to comment on U.S. decisions. But he underlined the bloc's position that \"preserving the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark, its sovereignty and the inviolability of its borders is essential for the European Union.”",

Fanil Sarvarov, head of the Operational Training Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces' General Staff, died from his injuries, said Svetlana Petrenko, the spokesperson for Russia’s Investigative Committee, the nation's top criminal investigation agency.\n\n“Investigators are pursuing numerous lines of inquiry regarding the murder. One of these is that the crime was orchestrated by Ukrainian intelligence services,” Petrenko said.\n\nSince Moscow sent troops into Ukraine nearly four years ago, Russian authorities have blamed Ukraine for several assassinations of military officers and public figures in Russia. Ukraine has claimed responsibility for some of them. It has not yet commented on Monday's death.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that President Vladimir Putin had been immediately informed about Sarvarov's killing.\n\nThe Defense Ministry said that Sarvarov had previously fought in Chechnya and taken part in Moscow's military campaign in Syria.\n\nJust over a year ago, Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, the chief of the military’s nuclear, biological and chemical protection forces, was killed by a bomb hidden on an electric scooter outside his apartment building. Kirillov's assistant also died. Ukraine’s security service claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nAn Uzbek man was quickly arrested and charged with killing Kirillov on behalf of the Ukrainian security service.\n\nPutin described Kirillov’s killing as a “major blunder” by Russia’s security agencies, noting they should learn from it and improve their efficiency.\n\nIn April, another senior Russian military officer, Lt. Gen. Yaroslav Moskalik, a deputy head of the main operational department in the General Staff, was killed by an explosive device placed in his car parked near his apartment building just outside Moscow. A suspected perpetrator was quickly arrested.\n\nDays after Moskalik's killing, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he received a report from the head of Ukraine’s foreign intelligence agency on the “liquidation” of top Russian military figures, adding that “justice inevitably comes\" although he didn't mention Moskalik's name.",

    "fullText": "Federal prosecutors have alleged they have dozens of photos showing former Michigan co-offensive coordinator Matt Weiss entering three team offices right before he hacked college students’ personal accounts, according to a search warrant affidavit by the FBI.\n\nMultiple outlets have reported that as part of a filing in Detroit federal court late this week, that investigators included photos of Weiss accessing the football team facilities before allegedly using computers in the quarterbacks and tight ends meeting rooms to get into the accounts.\n\nWeiss was indicted on March 20, with federal authorities accusing him of stealing private photos and videos from more than 3,300 student athletes — with many of them being women — from more than 100 universities across the United States.\n\nThe photo evidence from security footage that prosecutors submitted last week came as Weiss’ legal team attempted to get the charges dismissed through multiple recent motions.\n\nWeiss’ lawyers filed two recent motions in November and December trying to have the charges — 14 counts of unauthorized access and 10 counts of aggravated identity theft — tossed.\n\nThe lawyers have questioned the constitutionality of warrants by the University of Michigan Police Department and the discovery of evidence by the FBI, which they allege came to light through the UMPD’s investigation.\n\nFederal prosecutors responded, according to the Detroit Free Press, that Weiss is pushing back about the way evidence was discovered and not the charges themselves.\n\n“Weiss does not challenge the FBI federal warrant directly. He does not claim that this warrant’s affidavit lacks probable cause. He does not claim that this warrant was overbroad or lacked particularity. And he does not – and cannot – claim that the federal warrant included any information obtained by UMPD during its search of devices pursuant to the warrants that Weiss challenges,” the government’s filing read.\n\nWeiss is also facing a civil lawsuit by more than 70 women who say he hacked into private accounts to steal private photos.\n\nHe was the offensive coordinator under Jim Harbaugh but was fired in February 2023 following the allegations.",

    "description": "An Asheville father has sued Mission Hospital and an employee who was driving a company vehicle when he allegedly struck and killed a cyclist.",
    "fullText": "ASHEVILLE - An Asheville father has filed a lawsuit against Mission Hospital and one of its employees after the employee allegedly struck and killed his son on Swannanoa River Road while driving a company vehicle.\n\nMichael Rozos, the father of Alexander Rozos, filed the lawsuit Dec. 18 in Buncombe County Superior Court against the driver, Mauricio Roberto Melgar Delgado, HCA Healthcare, Mission Hospital and its parent companies.\n\nAn Asheville Police Department investigation showed Alexander Rozos was riding a bicycle west along Swannanoa River Road around 11:42 a.m. July 18, 2024, while a driver identified as Delgado, 48, was driving a white box truck in the same direction behind him. After both Rozos and Delgado passed through the intersection of South Tunnel Road, Delgado overtook Rozos, fatally striking and running him over, an APD incident report confirms.\n\nThe lawsuit reveals that at the time of the crash, Delgado was driving a 2019 Kenworth truck – owned by HCA – “within the course and scope of his employment” with Mission Hospital. Rozos' attorney, Thomas Killoren Jr., described the vehicle as a \"20,000-pound, large delivery vehicle.\"\n\nDelgado drove the truck away before officers arrived, and Alexander Rozos died at the scene of the collision, the Citizen Times previously reported.\n\nRozos was a Haw Creek resident, cyclist and athlete who had been recruited by the military on a fast track to the United States Army Special Forces, his father previously told the Citizen Times. An avid climber, Rozos was riding to a climbing gym when he was struck, Michael Rozos said.\n\n\"He was riding his bike to work and was hit and killed for absolutely no reason. Where do you start to describe the loss that these parents have experienced? It's just devastating and it must stop,\" Killoren Jr. told the Citizen Times Dec. 19.\n\nThe lawsuit claims negligence and wrongful death by Delgado, along with vicarious liability and negligent hiring and supervision by Mission Hospital and HCA. The lawsuit cited a legal doctrine called respondeat superior, which holds an employer legally responsible for the wrongful acts of an employee.\n\n“HCA Defendants are vicariously liable for the negligent, careless, and reckless acts and omissions of their employee/agent,” the lawsuit said.\n\nThe HCA defendants were negligent in hiring and supervision by either failing to have policies in place to train and monitor their drivers or failing to enforce them, the lawsuit claims. The suit also alleges the company failed to have or enforce drivers’ compliance with motor vehicle laws and failed to have or implement an adequate safety program for the “safety and protection of the motoring public.”\n\nMore: Asheville police find, charge driver in hit-and-run death of cyclist; victim named\n\nThe lawsuit goes on to further claim that HCA and Mission Hospital failed to properly investigate Delgado’s driving record and ensure he had the right training, credentials and skills to drive a company vehicle. HCA and Mission Hospital “knew or should have known” Delgado could not drive a vehicle safely and effectively, the lawsuit claims.\n\nThe lawsuit is seeking a jury trial and damages to cover hospital bills, funeral expenses and compensation for pain and suffering.\n\nMission Hospital spokesperson Nancy Lindell did not respond to Citizen Times questions sent Dec. 19, including whether Delgado is still employed by Mission and what guidelines the hospital and HCA have in place for hiring and training drivers.\n\nDelgado was indicted to Buncombe County Superior Court on Nov. 4, 2024, under a charge of felony hit and run inflicting serious injury or death. The Citizen Times attempted to reach Delgado.\n\nMore: 'Deeply flawed:' Asheville ranks 1st in North Carolina for bicyclist deaths per capita\n\nMore: Asheville woman demands road safety changes after fiancé killed in NC 251 bike crash\n\nMore: Restrict skateboards, bikes downtown Marshall?

    "fullText": "Barcelona manager Hansi Flick was forced to deploy a lineup sans-Pedri against Villarreal last night at the Estadio de La Ceramica, and the team did indeed struggle in the buildup phase where the Canary Islander shines the brightest.\n\nThey did, however, take the game by the scruff and dictate terms to good effect from start to finish, registering a 2-0 win and taking three massive points away from Villarreal.\n\nRaphinha earned and scored a penalty in the first half to hand Barcelona the lead. Villarreal then had a man sent off, forcing them to change their plans and handing the visitors more momentum.\n\nThe second goal eventually arrived from the feet of Lamine Yamal past the hour mark, burying the result and securing all three points.\n\nBarça Universal brings you three takeaways from Villarreal 0-2 Barcelona.\n\nBarcelona were dominant throughout their win over Villarreal last night, and the Yellow Submarines barely ever created a threat out of their own effort and precision.\n\nThe chances they did get, however, came directly off errors from Barcelona’s defence through sloppy decision making, poor positioning or lazy passing.\n\nIt would be wrong to single out a particular name as the weak link in defence, for every Barcelona defender seemed to be error-prone. At one point, the Catalans should even have been two goals down just for the quality of chances gifted to Villarreal.\n\nGerard Martin, for starters, had an off game and seemed to be taking too long to make his decision on the ball. The Spaniard fumbled in possession often and even gifted an open chance to score in the first half when he passed directly into Villarreal’s possession.\n\nPau Cubarsi seemed less error-prone, but he too made a fair share of mistakes, including those leading directly to shots on goal.\n\nAlejandro Balde, meanwhile, was possibly Barcelona’s most disappointing presence at the back as he constantly struggled to keep up with Nicholas Pepe and Tajon Buchanan. At one point, he underhit a back-pass and was lucky to have seen the ball cleared off the line.\n\nWhile the result will be celebrated, Barcelona’s defence was simply too error-prone on the day and Flick will take note of the same.\n\nJoan Garcia was top-notch in goal. (Photo by Eric Alonso/Getty Images)\n\nFor all the chances Barcelona’s defence gifted Villarreal at Estadio de La Ceramica, the ball never got past Joan Garcia once from a shot. The only time it got past him was through a deflection off Jules Kounde, but even that was immediately ruled out for offside.\n\nBeyond that one occasion, Garcia was simply impenetrable and put up a stunning show in goal for Barcelona – probably one of the best goalkeeping performances at the club in years.\n\nIn 90 minutes, Garcia made five saves, including four from inside the box, to deny Villarreal any goals. He prevented an xG of close to one and even made nine recoveries.\n\nThe five saves he made, however, are only the ones that reflect on paper and do not include the numerous superhuman saves he made for shots that were eventually called to be from offside moves.\n\nGarcia denied the hosts any chance of scoring even in 1v1s, and at one point in the game, went out in full-stretch to make a stunning save. Later in the game, he again stepped up with a double-save to prevent any roads back into the game for the opposition.\n\nAt this point, every passing game makes the €25 million look like a bigger bargain, for Garcia may well be one of the best shotstoppers on the planet.\n\nBarcelona’s game against Villarreal last night was their final fixture of 2025, and they have bid farewell to the year in the best manner possible.\n\nThe year has been special for the Blaugrana, with them winning three domestic titles and coming within a hair’s breadth of the UEFA Champions League final. The new season started dubiously, but they have well and truly turned their situation around since the Chelsea game.\n\nHaving won all of their last seven games, including every single fixture in December, Barcelona end the year flying high and riding on serious momentum. They will now disperse for Christmas, but not without a significant lead.\n\nThe win over Villarreal on Sunday leaves Barcelona four points clear in the league standings. They sit on 46 points after 18 games, while second-placed Real Madrid are four points behind on 42. Goodbye 2025, indeed.",

    "description": "Williamsville senior running back Matthew Miller made the most of his time as the SJ-R's Small School Football Player of the Year.",
    "fullText": "Matthew Miller relished every morsel of the football season, big and small.\n\nEven practices he embraced with equal fervor.\n\nSee the Small School All-Area Team: Here is the SJ-R's Small School All-Area football team for 2025\n\nHS football around Springfield: See complete coverage from the 2025 season\n\nThe Williamsville senior running back conjured 299 rushing yards and four touchdowns in a glistening Week 8 performance against Sangamo Conference rival Maroa-Forsyth. There was also senior linebacker Devin Fulgenzi’s catch during one particular practice that set off a maelstrom of celebration that will happily remain among Miller’s favorite memories.\n\nMiller truly loved football, pure and simple.\n\nHe ultimately ran for 1,323 yards and 28 touchdowns on 135 carries and caught 23 passes for 222 yards and three scores to become The State Journal-Register's Small School Football Player of the Year after former teammate Braddock Cates won the award last year.\n\nMiller picked up a few cues from Cates, but he also carved out his own path with his own flair.\n\nHe developed a physical presence through wrestling, while he added more explosiveness over the offseason through track and field. It forged a potent blend of power and speed as a key cornerstone of the Williamsville offense that pivoted back to its traditional spread attack.\n\n“Junior year of football, I was like, ‘Man, I’m quick, but I don’t have that breakaway speed,’” Miller said. “So, I did track over the junior spring and it really helped me getting my top speed faster and really focused.”\n\nLast year’s Wing-T equipped Miller with reps, but he more than welcomed the schematic change with a host of other weapons around him — not to mention a robust offensive line.\n\n“I think it was almost easier to run out of the spread because teams couldn’t load the boxes and our pass game did so well,” Miller said. “We could throw the ball as much as we could run the ball, which just opened up everything. It was definitely nice to go back to the spread.”\n\nMiller and Company cruised to a second straight Sangamo title and reached the Class 3A quarterfinals for the first time since the state runner-up campaign in 2022.\n\nThe Illinois High School Football Coaches Association voted Miller to the Class 3A all-state team along the way. Miller was also all-Sangamo first team offensively. He finished his career with 2,148 rushing yards and 45 touchdowns. He averaged nearly 10 yards per carry over that span.\n\nMiller reflected how the team rallied together over the offseason after a couple of disappointing postseason appearances. Those offseason meetings set the tone for the year, according to Miller.\n\n“We did it because we just thought the culture wasn’t the same as years prior,” Miller said. “We just thought we weren’t tight with each other and we had only won one playoff game in the last two years. We needed to figure out things and focus on the correct things.\n\n“When we did that, we had to change our culture. It was just a way we could bond together in those meetings and talk about what we needed to change so we could enjoy practice and enjoy being around each other without getting burned out during the long season.”\n\nMiller indeed did not burn out and even bounced back from a concussion he sustained against Maroa. Miller got this unbridled zest for football from his older brother, Michael, who graduated from Riverton in 2018.\n\n“He was my (JFL) coach in fifth grade and led us to a Super Bowl title,” said Miller, who transferred to Williamsville the following year. “He was always waking me up. He really pushed me to my limits and beyond my limits to make me the best I could be on the field and always want to be the best on the field.\n\n“He set the tone for me. He would always tell me, ‘Are you going to be better than me or are you going to let your big bro be better than you?’ He made it a competition, but it was to make me more hungry.”\n\nMiller continued to turn to his older brother for advice over the phone through high school, where he made the transition to running back.\n\nWhether or not Miller pursues football at the next level is undecided at the moment.\n\nOne thing is certain, however. Miller hopes the Bullets can build on the past season and go even further.\n\nThis article originally appeared on State Journal-Register: Williamsville's Matthew Miller is Small School Football Player of the Year",

    "description": "Texas Tech football has a defense for the ages this season. The architect of the Red Raiders' next best defenses, Richard Bell, died this month.",
    "fullText": "The Texas Tech football team's average yield of 10.92 points per game this season would be a school record for scoring defense in the modern era, defined by the National Football Foundation as 1950 and later.\n\nOver the past 60 years, Tech's next five stingiest defenses by average points allowed came in the five consecutive seasons from 1970-74. Those are the years Richard Bell was the Red Raiders' defensive coordinator, or head defensive coach, as he was commonly referenced.\n\n\"Oh, wow,\" said Tommy Cones, a Red Raiders defensive end who lettered from 1972-74. \"Well, that tells you a lot right there. Numbers don't lie, right?\"\n\n\"That's amazing. That's amazing,\" said Gaines Baty, a defensive end who lettered from 1970-72. \"Well, he was known across the country as a defensive expert.\"\n\nBell died on Dec. 13 in Woodstock, Georgia. He was 88.\n\nMore: Texas Tech football's Jacob Rodriguez on Heisman vote, awards circuit\n\nHis passing prompted reflection among those who played under him.\n\n\"Richard Bell was the epitome of character, integrity, intensity, passion and excellence,\" Baty said. \"He set a high standard for the football team, as well as personally for every player on that team.\"\n\nBell came to Texas Tech from West Virginia with head coach Jim Carlen in 1970 and followed Carlen to South Carolina after the 1974 season. Tech and Vanderbilt played to a 6-6 tie in the Peach Bowl on Dec. 28, 1974, before Vandy coach Steve Sloan switched programs. Late on New Year's Eve, Sloan announced he was staying at Vanderbilt, but he changed his mind and accepted the Texas Tech job on New Year's Day.\n\nThe next day, the Avalanche-Journal reported Bell, according to Texas Tech insiders, \"would have landed the job had Sloan not reconsidered during the wee hours of New Year's morn.\"\n\nBell was a college head coach for only one year, going 4-7 in 1982 at South Carolina.\n\nHis long coaching career included stints as defensive coordinator at West Virginia (1968-69), Texas Tech (1970-74), South Carolina (1975-81), Duke (1983-87), East Carolina (1988), Georgia (1989-93), Navy (1994) and Air Force (1995-2006). The Arkansas native was a captain on Frank Broyles' first Razorbacks team in 1958 and made early coaching stops at Virginia Military (1962-63) and Georgia Tech (1964-67).\n\nHe worked under College Football Hall of Fame coaches Bobby Dodd and Fisher DeBerry at Georgia Tech and Air Force, respectively, and alongside Hall of Fame coach Bobby Bowden when Bowden was offensive coordinator at West Virginia.\n\nBefore leaving Georgia, Bell recruited a young defensive back named Kirby Smart.\n\n\"He just knew how to get the most out of every player,\" Cones said, \"and he had some really, really good pep talks. He was such a professional in terms of communicating, and you'd get really pumped up when he's your coach. He had a certain charisma about him. He would say the right thing, the things you wanted to hear before you went out to win a game for him.\"\n\nFormer Tech defensive tackle David Knaus described Bell as calm, controlled, thorough and confident. Knaus, an all-Southwest Conference honoree in 1973, said Bell's style was a polar opposite of Bill Parcells, who followed him as Tech defensive coordinator.\n\n\"Other than both of them being tremendous coaches, they couldn't have been more different in their styles,\" Knaus said. \"As an example, I never heard profanity ever uttered from coach Bell. He barely ever needed to raise his voice. It was always controlled correction.\"\n\nTech went 8-4 in 1970, holding opponents to 13.5 points per game. The Red Raiders slipped to 4-7 in 1971, though the defense yielded only 12.5 points per game, and defensive back Marc Dove was Southwest Conference defensive player of the year. Bell's units held opponents to 14.2 points per game in 1972, 15.3 in 1973 and 13.8 in 1974.\n\nThe 1972 team finished 8-4 with a Sun Bowl loss to North Carolina. The 1973 team finished 11-1 with a Gator Bowl conquest of Tennessee.\n\nWhile serving as the Red Raiders' defensive coordinator, Bell was position coach for defensive ends and linebackers. End Bruce Dowdy earned all-Southwest Conference recognition in 1970, linebacker Larry Molinare in 1971 and Cones in 1974.\n\n\"He took a lot of running backs and good athletes,\" Baty said, \"and turned them into linebackers and defensive ends. That was kind of his way to do it. He liked a good athlete that would hit you.\"\n\nBaty came to Tech as a running back, quickly moved to linebacker and then played his entire varsity career at defensive end. Noseguard Don Rives was a second-team all-American in 1972. In the spring before that season, Rives called Baty \"the best defensive end in this league\" and \"the most underrated player in this conference.\"\n\nTo the extent that was true, Baty chalked it up to his coach.\n\n\"He made me as a player,\" Baty said. \"Not that I was anything special, but whatever I was is because of Richard Bell.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Lubbock Avalanche-Journal: Remembering Richard Bell, Texas Tech football defensive coordinator",

    "fullText": "Editor's note: This story is the fourth in a series related to Purdue's 2000 football season.\n\nJoe Tiller was big on goal setting and each spring in individual meetings with every member of the Purdue football team, Tiller would tell his players he needed a tangible goal and another intangible goal.\n\nThe responses often varied, but there were some unified checklist items entering the Boilermakers 2000 season.\n\nA Big Ten title and a Rose Bowl trip were common.\n\nFor Kelly Kitchel, a reserve offensive lineman in 2000, his intangible goal always remained the same: Go undefeated and win a national championship.\n\n\"I never wanted to go into a game feeling like we could be beat,\" Kitchel said. \"That may have been the year I truly believed it. When I told him we were going to go undefeated, I truly believed it in my heart because of the guys we had in the room and the staff we had.\"\n\nThere was no question Purdue had the offense, with freshman receiver John Standeford a nice surprise to add into the mix with unquestionably one of the nation's top offensive lines, tight end and quarterback, and a speedy playmaker in Vinny Sutherland.\n\nEntering the season, defensive coordinator Brock Spack was hopeful his side of the ball could hold up its end.\n\n\"I was really nervous going into the year because we had an inexperienced defense,\" Spack said. \"Offensively, we had Drew (Brees) and a really experienced offensive line that was really good. We ran the ball really well. Everybody knew we threw it, but we ran the ball well. Going into the season, I had anxiety about how young we were (on defense). I think we started five true freshmen and I think seven of them played pretty good roles as rotational guys.\"\n\nSpack would worry a lot less about his defense after the season opener.\n\nCentral Michigan totaled just 215 yards at Ross-Ade Stadium on Sept. 2, 2000. Purdue's defense forced four fumbles and recovered three. Matt Mitrione blocked a 33-yard field goal and the Boilermakers posted their first shutout since beating Northwestern 35-0 on Oct. 17, 1981, with a 48-0 thumping of the Chippewas.\n\nSaid linebacker Landon Johnson: \"It was a good start to the season. The first time at a new level you always have nervousness to begin with. Once the game starts, you realize it’s just football. Being a young defense, we had a lot of stuff to learn with all our inexperience. But really, the offense we had at that time helped us a lot defensively being able to grow faster. We took our lumps in practice a lot, but it helped us get better a lot faster.\"\n\nPurdue was in a fourth-and-short and despite being near the 30-yard line, the Boilermakers lined up in a goal-line package.\n\n\"This kind of speaks to Drew's special ability,\" Lougheed said. \"Normally, coming off the goal line, there's not much space. You're just kind of hitting the end zone. Drew said, 'Just keep on going. Don't stop.' I think he knew that play would be successful. I just kept going and he threw a long touchdown, just like he envisioned it.\"\n\nBrees would also throw touchdowns to Tim Stratton and John Standeford, who had a big debut with Sutherland serving a one-game suspension.\n\n\"John Standeford came to camp as a basketball guy but he’s 6-foot-4 and long,\" receivers coach Kevin Sumlin said. \"When he ran, we made him run three times because I didn’t believe he was that fast. We put him in a short area quickness drill and it’s pop, pop, pop. Coach (Jim) Chaney was like, 'Wow, who is recruiting this guy?' Nobody is recruiting him. Coach Chaney is like, 'Let’s take him.' The kid was raw, but, man, what a good player.\"\n\nCentral Michigan threatened the shutout in the final moments, but one of Purdue's freshman standouts saved the day. On third-and-goal from the 1, Gilbert Gardner hit Robbie Mixon in the backfield, popping the ball loose. Tom Vaughan, who was from Lafayette and grew up selling Cokes on game days inside Ross-Ade Stadium, dove on the fumble to preserve the shutout.\n\n\"I was getting ready to run in there and make a play and the next thing you know, the ball is right in front of me,\" Vaughan said. \"I’m either going to jump on it or Brady Doe is going to jump on it. I didn’t have time to think there was all this green in front of me, I could pick it up and run for a touchdown. I saved myself a lot of oxygen by just jumping on it.\"\n\nIt was more of the same in Purdue's second game, a 45-10 win over Kent State when Sutherland was welcomed back with two receiving touchdowns and another on the ground. Brees rushed for two touchdowns and completed 32 of 46 passes for 415 yards, passing Mark Herrmann to become Purdue's career leader in total offense and completions.\n\n\"The mentality was to take care of business early and get out of it injury free because we knew what the next week was,\" Sutherland said. \"You don’t look past anybody. But we knew what we needed to do and we needed to do it early.\"\n\nNotre Dame was playing its third of four straight ranked opponents to open the 2000 season. The Irish were coming off an overtime loss at No. 1 Nebraska. The Boilermakers dug a hole, having an early punt blocked inside the 10 that set up a touchdown. Shane Walton's 60-yard interception return put the Irish up 14-0 in the first quarter.\n\nMontrell Lowe's TD got Purdue on the scoreboard and Brees connected with Sutherland for two touchdowns, the second putting Purdue in front 21-20 with 3:39 to go at Notre Dame Stadium.\n\nNotre Dame’s Nick Setta kicked a game-winning 38-yard field goal as time expired. The Fighting Irish won 23-21. They say you remember the losses more than the wins; 25 years later, there may be some truth to that.\n\nSaid fullback Jacob Rowe: \"We mopped the field with Notre Dame. I can’t believe we lost that game. Every stat. I remember thinking, they’re coming back but who cares. We'd been mopping the field with them all day. We just had a couple bonehead plays and lost the game.\"\n\nSaid right guard Ian Allen: \"There were three plays I can recall letting my boy Lance Legree, who was a teammate of mine with the (New York) Giants. I let him come through the backfield and make a tackle for loss. I was tentative in my steps. Personally, those were three killed drives I could improve on. I actually got benched for two weeks after that. Rob Turner took over and I came back and took the spot back.\"\n\nSaid defensive tackle Rocco Foggio: \"We were better than that Notre Dame team. And, you know, that's a game where I missed three sacks that could have changed the outcome of the game. And then we had a snafu on the punt because of the noise, so we didn't lose because we're outmatched, we lost because we beat ourselves.\"\n\nSaid safety Ben Smith: \"You can go feel sorry for yourself or you can get back and go to work. That is what we did. We had these high expectations for the year. We went back and went to work.\"\n\nSaid linebacker Akin Ayodele: \"It was self-inflicting errors. When we went back and watched it, the difference was making a play. It came down to a couple of plays where we needed to stop Notre Dame’s offense and we didn’t. When we watched the film, it was a matter of 'What if?' We may have had another victory. Guys were able to self reflect and pivot and allow themselves to become better because they were open to feedback.\"\n\nAfter the disappointing loss, Purdue had to redirect its attention with conference play beginning. The Boilermakers needed a strong start and got it in all facets.\n\n\"Losing to a terrible Notre Dame team (Notre Dame finished 9-3, losing to Oregon State in the Fiesta Bowl) didn’t set us off in the right direction, so we needed a bounce-back win and we needed it bad,\" Sutherland said.\n\nPurdue's offensive line paved the way and Brees picked apart the Gophers with early touchdowns to Sutherland and AT Simpson.\n\n\"It was a second-level throw, and Drew threaded the deal,\" Simpson said. \"I just remember like, 'Man, this guy is really good, really accurate.' And I think that was a pretty explosive game if my memory serves me correct. I think we put up some pretty big numbers on the scoreboard.\"\n\nSimpson's memory is a fair portrayal of that game on Sept. 23, 2000.\n\nBrees threw for 409 yards and two touchdowns, while rushing for 88 and scoring another on the ground in a 38-24 win in which Purdue built a 31-3 lead. Ennis punched in two short-yard TDs. Tim Stratton had 105 yards, the tight end's second 100-yard game of the season.\n\nFreshman free safety Stuart Schweigert had an interception for the second straight game, long before he left as Purdue's career record holder for interceptions. Doe, Ayodele, Johnson and Joe Odom had sacks, while Mitrione and Ashante Woodyard each had two tackles for loss.\n\nThe Boilermakers were back on track. Briefly.\n\nPenn State cornerback Adam Taliaferro suffered a career-ending spinal cord injury seven days before the Boilermakers traveled to Happy Valley on Sept. 30, 2000.\n\nIt was a tough day for Dorsch, who botched a pair of punts that set up short Nittany Lion touchdowns, and missed a 46-yard field goal with 2:32 to go, the final heartbreaker in a 22-20 loss.\n\n\"It was very unusual (that) I punted from out of our own end zone in my career — these might have been the only two,\" Dorsch said. \"I remember watching the film the day after the game when we got back to West Lafayette and seeing, the first time I think it was LaVar Arrington and the second time it was another longtime NFL player. One time they jumped over our center and the other time they went right through and knocked two guys over. You have an internal clock. As a kicker and a punter, we know that you have to get the field goal off in 1.3 (seconds) and you have to get the punt off in 1.9. Otherwise it’s getting blocked. I remember both of those catching the ball and feeling like I was already in a pocket. I already had to make a fast decision when I caught the ball. The first one I pulled the ball down because I was like, 'This is going to be a touchdown, they’re going to block it.' Worst case I want to try to get some yards and give our defense a shot to hold them to a field goal. That’s stupid; I am a punter. I was able to dodge and weave and get close to back to the line of scrimmage. Ultimately, that’s a failure. That is not what we’re looking for out of our punt team. Not ideal. That deflates your defense because you’re putting them in a huge hole they aren’t going to have success in.\"\n\nIn a role reversal, Sutherland threw a touchdown pass to Brees early in the second half to give Purdue a 13-6 lead. But thanks to the two punt team miscues, Penn State scored 16 points in a span of 6:23.\n\n\"At the point where there's no turning back. We can't lose these next critical games,\" safety Tim Upshur said. \"So it's either now or never, and it's like you guys are going to squander the potential and the momentum that you've built over the last three years if you are not successful at this point\"\n\n\"When we lost to Notre Dame and Penn State early in the season, it was the day after Penn State, we got chewed out by offensive coordinator Jim Chaney. We went full pads. Coach Tiller was in a pissed off mood,\" receiver Seth Morales said. \"We should have beat Notre Dame on the road and we were the better team against Penn State. They had the kid who got injured and it was a freak accident the game before. The kid was paralyzed and they had a white out rally cry and played good enough to beat us. We were 3-2 and it’s like, 'What is this season going to turn into? Is this a 7-5 season or are we going to make a run at the championship and the Rose Bowl?' We needed those two losses to go through a low point and come out and make that season special.\"\n\nThat full pads practice came on the first day of October. It may have been the turning point of Purdue's season.\n\nThe Boilermakers were about to buckle up for a wild four Saturdays in October.\n\nNathan Baird and Sam King have the best Purdue sports coverage, and \n\nThis article originally appeared on Indianapolis Star: Purdue football Rose Bowl season had errors in loss vs Notre Dame, Penn State",

    "fullText": "Der Rekordmeister head into the winter break unbeaten at the top of the Bundesliga, and while major incomings are off the agenda, FC Bayern sporting director Max Eberl insists that the club will not be completely inactive over the festive period.\n\nSpeaking to Sport1, the 52-year-old acknowledged that departures cannot be entirely ruled out.\n\n“There can always be a player who feels a little less satisfied and, when the injured players return, decides they want to do something else,” Eberl explained.\n\nOne player who could be allowed to leave if the right offer arrives is right-back Sacha Boey. The 25-year-old has struggled for minutes in Munich, and reports from The Standard suggest that Premier League outfit Crystal Palace are interested in bringing in the full-back.\n\nWhile potential exits remain a possibility, Bayern's main focus is on extending key contracts. Several deals are approaching their expiry dates, including those of centre-back Dayot Upamecano and forward Serge Gnabry.\n\n“There are extensions we want to complete, and those are well known,” said Eberl, who hinted that supporters could be treated to some positive news over Christmas. \"Maybe there will be a pleasant phone call before Christmas. I don't know, but sometimes you do get surprised.\n\nBayern are in firm control at the top of the Bundesliga, and contract renewals appear to be the goal set over the coming break.",

    "fullText": "PISCATAWAY – Let the competition begin.\n\nRutgers football will have a new starting quarterback in 2026 and coach Greg Schiano is making it clear whoever gets the job will have to earn it.\n\nWhile AJ Surace, the backup to Athan Kaliakmanis this past season, might be in the driver’s seat, nothing is guaranteed.\n\nAnd Schiano also isn’t ruling out the possibility of bringing in another signal-caller via the transfer portal.\n\n“I love AJ,” Schiano said Dec. 16 during a meeting with a small group of local reporters. “I think he’s a very talented, committed player. I don’t rule out anything as far as – is there going to be something we do in the portal with a quarterback? Maybe. I don’t know. We’re always looking.”\n\nMORE: Rutgers football adds 4-star safety to 2026 recruiting class\n\nWhomever takes over for Kaliakmanis will have big shoes to fill. After transferring from Minnesota prior to the 2024 season, Kaliakmanis became of the more prolific quarterbacks in program history during his two seasons in a Scarlet Knights uniform.\n\nThis past season he threw for 3,124 yards and 20 touchdowns.\n\nRutgers brought Surace in as part of the 2024 recruiting class. The son of longtime Princeton head coach Bob Surace, AJ Surace has garnered praise within the program for his knowledge, decision-making, quick processing, strong arm and high football IQ.\n\nSurace’s game experience is limited – he played in three games this past season, with his most extensive playing time coming in a two-touchdown performance in a blowout win over Norfolk State after Kaliakmanis went to the bench once the game was out of hand.\n\n“I’m confident AJ has worked really hard,” Schiano said. “But there will be a competition. We have other quarterbacks in the program as well.”\n\nThose other quarterbacks include Sean Ashenfelder, who’s heading into his second year with Rutgers, and now true freshman Xavier Stern, who just signed as part of the 2026 recruiting class.\n\nThose are the only three scholarship quarterbacks on the roster.\n\nThat means that right now there’s not a ton of experience behind Surace, who played at Notre Dame High School.\n\nKaliakmanis provided stability and certainty at the quarterback situation the last couple seasons after he won the job over Gavin Wimsatt.\n\nNow Kaliakmanis’ departure ushers in the start of a new era – and a new competition that will kick into high gear once spring practices begin in March.\n\n“Around here everything’s based on competition,” Schiano said, “and quarterback’s no different.”\n\nThis article originally appeared on NorthJersey.com: Rutgers QB competition opens with AJ Surace, Sean Ashenfelder, Xavier Stern",

    "description": "Lake Weir boys basketball has suffered several losses in the last two years. They're taking those lessons to to fuel their best start in over 10 years",
    "fullText": "Lake Weir head basketball coach Freddie Riley gathered his basketball team to deliver the hardest conversation he’s had as a basketball coach two seasons ago. When the news of former Hurricanes guard Tylique Christie's murder left his mouth, he choked back tears.\n\nA few months later, Riley was giving another heart-breaking update. This time they lost Lukas Toste, who would have been a senior this year to suicide.\n\nThe Hurricanes carry their memories on their chest right above their heart in a gold medallion-like emblem encircling the number 14, Christie's old jersey number on every varsity jersey. In spirit they're both helping the Hurricanes to a 7-2 record, their best start to a season since their 6-3 in 2015-16.\n\n“My seniors, they've seen a lot,\" Riley said. \"They've been through a lot together. You know, they just stay focused. We've had different hardships throughout the program. We got some kids in our program that have really tough lives at home. We all, it's important for us to be there for each other. It's important for us to always just share with each other and be happy for each other. We talked about the environment tonight. You got to be pretty tough to playing it, man, but you're telling me these kids are just as tough off the court too.”\n\nThrough the first half of the season the Hurricanes are 7-2. Lake Weir boys basketball has experienced ups and downs over the 18 months. The Hurricanes finished above .500 for the first time under coach Riley's four-year coaching stint.\n\nIt’s the Hurricanes best start to a season in Riley’s tenure, and it may have something to do with their guard play. With their depth and guard play they're becoming a not so dark horse for the Marion Athletic Conference boys basketball championship.\n\nLake Weir has toppled West Port, Dunnellon, and coach Riley's alma mater Vanguard in the first half of the 2025-26 season. If not for Christie encouraging senior point guard Amar Young to become the playmaking threa, he is today they would be a very different team.\n\n“Freshman year, we said we was going to change the narrative,\" Young said. \"Now we are changing the narrative. It's just our turn. We're coming to make statements.”\n\nAntonio Jackson's athletic evolution is responsible for giving Lake Weir arguably the best backcourt duo in the county. According to MaxPreps. Only Forest and Dunnellon’s guards routinely touch Young and Jackson’s combined 24.9 points and 5.1 assists per game.\n\nYoung and Jackson are the anchors of the Hurricanes standout first half of the season. That chemistry forged in years of AAU battles and varsity dogfights drives this team but it’s not the only reason Lake Weir basketball is successful.\n\n“We can't sit back and let people take it from us,\" Jackson said. \"If we want it, we got to truly show on the court, we' going to practice and we're taking it one step at the time. We're trying to just get better from when we started.”\n\nThe Hurricanes move as an athletic unit. Once you look past the scoring column, you’ll find an 8-man rotation responsible for the team’s success.\n\nThe 2025-26 season marks the physical and mental maturity of the Lake Weir Hurricanes who have gritted its teeth through the toughest teacher life has to offer: loss. Now they're using it to make a lasting impression in the Ocala area.\n\n“My boys, they believe, man,” Riley said. “They believe in each other. They love each other. They play for each other; they are always happy for each other. You know, we got a real brotherhood, so we built something special.”\n\nThis article originally appeared on Ocala Star-Banner: How loss empowered Lake Weir basketball to its best start in 10 years",

    "fullText": "After an exciting start to the high school boys basketball season, it's time to look back on the best performances.\n\nRead about the players who stood out last week and let us know who you think should be the HSS North Jersey Player of the Week in the poll at the bottom of this page.\n\nThe junior, a key piece as the Maroons reload after last season’s North 1, Group 4 sectional title, led them to a 2-0 start. He averaged 22.0 points and totaled three charges in double-digit wins over St. Joseph and Passaic Tech.\n\nThe senior displayed his versatility in double-digit wins over Saddle River Day and Glen Rock. He averaged 14.0 points, 11.0 rebounds, 6.0 steals, and 6.0 assists. He had 15 points and nine boards in a 48-32 win over Glen Rock.\n\nThe junior led the Tigers to a 2-0 start, averaging 27.0 points, 4.5 assists, 4.0 rebounds and 3.0 steals in double-digits wins over Cliffside Park and Dwight Morrow. He scored 35 in a 65-51 win over Dwight Morrow.\n\nThe junior paced the Norsemen to victories over Dwight Morrow and St. Joseph. He averaged 25.0 points, 4.5 rebounds, 3.5 assists, and 2.5 steals. He totaled nine three-pointers and made all seven of his free throws.\n\nThe senior led the Panthers to a 2-1 week, with wins over River Dell and Randolph, and averaged 22.3 points.

    "title": "Up in smoke: Inside New York City's chaotic crackdown on unlicensed weed shops",
    "description": "America's largest city wanted to get rid of illegal weed shops. Then came the SWAT teams.",
    "fullText": "On May 28, 2024, Lenore Elfand, the owner of Empire Cannabis Club, an unlicensed dispensary in New York's Chelsea neighborhood, received a frantic call from an employee. NYPD officers and deputies from the city's Sheriff's Office were lined up at the door, poised to raid the shop. Elfand said in an affidavit that when her security guard insisted on filming, officers placed him in handcuffs, killed the security cameras, and stormed in.\n\nElfand arrived 15 minutes later to find news crews interviewing New York City Sheriff Anthony Miranda, who was monitoring the raid. Inside, officers gathered products they suspected to contain THC and carried them away, Elfand said in a deposition. Her security guard was detained without charges for 30 hours. When she was given paperwork to sign, she wrote, the invoice \"had no actual documentation of what they took.\" More troubling was an omission: more than $10,000 in cash that she said officers removed from her store and that she never got back. Her claims were part of a larger suit on behalf of several cannabis merchants, in which a judge found that the Sheriff's Office violated the shop owners' constitutional rights.\n\nWeed, now legal for medical use in 40 states and fully legal in 24, has become one of the most ascendant industries in America. Cannabis retail sales nationwide have tripled since 2019, to a projected $34 billion this year. Now Big Weed is poised to get even bigger. Last week, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to expedite reclassifying cannabis from a Schedule I drug (the same designation as heroin and LSD) to a less dangerous Schedule III drug (like ketamine or Tylenol with codeine). The order doesn't legalize marijuana, but paves the way for further research into its potential benefits and for tax breaks for cannabis companies.\n\nBut building a successful business in a newly legal industry can be chaotic. And one place especially tumultuous has been in America's largest city.\n\nAfter New York State legalized marijuana in 2021, the state-approved industry was slow to materialize. As demand surged, hundreds of opportunistic merchants opened shop without licenses. At one point, The New York Times reported, they outnumbered Starbucks locations. Many were cash-only — making them prime targets for robberies. Teens loitered outside them, passing around medicinal-strength doobies they had purchased without any hassle. And the smell was everywhere: parks, playgrounds, even the steps of the Met — all wafted with dank clouds of ganja.\n\nIn 2024, after a public outcry, Gov. Kathy Hochul granted Mayor Eric Adams the authority to launch Operation Padlock to Protect. It was a sprawling deployment of K-9 units, SWAT vehicles, and officers in tactical gear to raid illegal weed stores, confiscate inventory, strap the merchants with debilitating fines, and potentially shutter them for as long as a year. The mayor heralded the dragnet as a rousing success. By City Hall's estimate, $95 million worth of cannabis products from the unlicensed sellers were seized.\n\nFor Elfand and other operators of unlicensed shops throughout New York, Operation Padlock to Protect has been a nightmare, largely at the discretion of the sheriff. An ex-cop with a gleaming pate, a horseshoe mustache, and a love for TV cameras, Miranda has been the subject of a Department of Investigation probe, three pending federal lawsuits, and a raft of complaints by the union representing his deputies — dozens of whom have reportedly quit.\n\nThe mayor and his office have stood by Miranda and the operation. \"Over the last four years, Mayor Adams has prioritized building a safe, well-regulated cannabis industry,\" a City Hall spokesperson wrote in a statement to Business Insider in response to questions for this article. \"To date, the team has sealed more than 1,600 illegal shops, marking a major step toward protecting communities from dangerous, unregulated products and strengthening a responsible legal market. This progress would not have been possible without Sheriff Miranda's leadership and his commitment to a safer, more equitable, and business-positive city.\" Miranda himself didn't comment to Business Insider.\n\nMiranda and Adams are both ex-cops who agitated for racial justice in the NYPD through organizations they founded: the National Latino Officers Association and 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care, respectively. Miranda's group endorsed Adams in 2021 and he made Miranda sheriff when he was elected.\n\nUnlicensed weed shops were already proliferating when Adams appointed Miranda to take over at the Sheriff's Office, which falls under the city's Department of Finance and enforces court orders, property seizures, and cigarette licensing and taxation.\n\nWhen then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo — who once called marijuana a \"gateway drug\" — legalized the plant in 2021, he let New Yorkers smoke it wherever they were allowed to smoke cigarettes, a far more permissive provision than California, Colorado, and Massachusetts, which require smokers to be on private property. As people were getting their first COVID vaccines and venturing back into public life, suddenly it was legal to take a bong rip on Fifth Avenue.\n\nCuomo also launched a framework for allowing the licensed sale of weed. Critics say the rollout was slow and prohibitive; the state, for example, set aside the first licenses for people who had cannabis convictions. By June 2023, just 15 licensed dispensaries had opened in the city. By comparison, Colorado had 200 in the first six months of legalization. As the city of 8 million yearned to burn, delis and bodegas began slinging THC products from behind the counter. Seemingly overnight, it became possible to buy a joint along with an egg sandwich in the morning. Soon, stores opened for the sole purpose of selling cannabis without a license. They were neon-lit and decorated with posters of stoned cartoon characters. They had names like Best Budz, Cannabis Culture, Flame Zone, Puff & Pass, Zaza City, Zaza Land, and Zaza Waza Smoke Shop.\n\nAnd with them came concerns: The inventory was unregulated and might not be safe, and the stores were magnets for crime. In 2022, there were 593 robberies of smoke shops, a fourfold increase from 2021.\n\nAs the greenrush overtook New York City, the Sheriff's Office scrambled to convince the public that it had control of the situation. After Miranda's office began inspections in September 2022, deputies reportedly found they were seizing more evidence than could fit in their six shipping containers. Their Queens headquarters had so much weed that employees reported breathing problems. The union, which said one deputy was coughing up blood, filed labor complaints.\n\nMiranda's employees also began to question whether they had legal authority to raid the merchants. Eleven deputies who raised concerns about the cannabis raids were suspended on allegations of stealing alcohol seized from bars raided during the pandemic. They were never criminally charged. Nine resigned, and two were found not guilty in an administrative trial.\n\nIn a federal lawsuit which is still in litigation, Deputy Sheriff Furney Canteen alleged that when he raised these concerns, the sheriff withheld his pay and transferred him to a punishing assignment. \"You're a soldier and your job is to follow orders,\" Miranda told him, according to the complaint. When Canteen responded that his job was to follow legal orders, the lawsuit alleges, the sheriff responded sarcastically, \"I'll check on that and get back to you.\"\n\nUntil 2024, the raids had little teeth. Even after deputies confiscated shops' inventory, the unlicensed operators who received fines often ignored them and went right back to selling weed.\n\nIn April 2024, Gov. Kathy Hochul gave Adams and Miranda an assist: The city would have the right to fine landlords renting to unlicensed weed stores, and the sheriff could padlock any business selling unlicensed cannabis. \"We waited far too long for this reckoning with all the illegal shops and your day has come,\" Hochul declared at a press conference.\n\nThree weeks later, Adams launched Operation Padlock to Protect with a fury. The Sheriff's Office conducted hundreds of raids — which via Hochul's initiative did not require warrants — in tandem with the NYPD. They opened safes and cash registers, and removed tens of thousands of dollars in cash from locations across the city. They filled giant garbage bags with weed, THC oils, and edibles. Ingrid Siminovic, spokesperson for the sheriff's union, claims that Miranda \"forced\" deputies to take safes.\n\nNadia Kahnauth, an attorney for more than 100 store owners who have been caught in Miranda's net, told Business Insider that a total of more than $1 million was seized from her clients. She says that as of December 2025, fewer than five of them had recovered their seized cash.\n\nAt a City Council hearing last year, the lawyer testified that \"in each and every location there is significant cash being removed from registers.\" She added, \"I have other stores where there's $25,000 being removed — absolutely no documentation … and no method to recover all this money.\"\n\nKahnauth said that at least 10 of her clients had received calls or visits from unidentified men who demanded donations to \"Latino organizations\" in exchange for protection from raids. One agreed to pay monthly and was raided and shut down after missing an installment, she said. The merchants, who are immigrants, would not speak on the record out of fear of retaliation, she said.\n\nAmong those caught in Miranda's dragnet was Tyler Lehmann. He was the president of the Breckenridge Cannabis Cafe in Williamsburg, which was licensed to sell hemp but not THC, when the Office of Cannabis Management (OCM) conducted a search in January 2024 and seized products its agents believed to contain cannabis, according to a lawsuit Lehman filed. The shop got an administrative hearing, and the violations were ultimately dismissed.\n\nEight months later, the Sheriff's Office showed up.\n\nA team of plain-clothed and uniformed officers in bulletproof vests barged in and searched behind the counter, security footage reviewed by Business Insider shows. Four officers found bottles of tinctures — a type of distillate that can contain THC, CBD, or a mixture of both — and poured them into a clear plastic cup. Once it was filled, an officer took the cup into the bathroom of the store and poured it down the toilet. After the raid, Lehmann received an Order to Cease Unlicensed Activity and a seizure notice that \"THC Drinks\" were removed from his store.\n\nA deputy from Miranda's Public Relations Bureau, Lt. Francesca Rosa claimed under oath in a state lawsuit against the Sheriff's Office last year that \"we are not required to test the product.\" She said that during the raids, the teams decided if a product was illegal based on a review of its packaging and labeling. She also testified that she could smell which products contained THC — a feat that is not humanly possible.\n\nLehman's attorney showed Rosa an order from a judge, who ruled after a hearing with the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings (OATH) that the Sheriff's Office \"failed to establish the store posed an imminent threat\" — allowing the store to reopen to sell non-cannabis products. But the Sheriff's Office still decided that the store did pose an imminent threat, and kept it padlocked.\n\nIn October 2024, a Queens judge ruled that Operation Padlock to Protect was unconstitutional, and found Miranda's enforcement to be \"capricious and arbitrary.\" City Hall appealed, and a decision from the state appeals court is pending. In a separate case, a federal judge ruled there was nothing unconstitutional about Miranda's discretionary padlockings. The New York Post reviewed hundreds of pages of files from OATH hearings and found Miranda kept padlocks on nearly 30% of stores greenlit by a judge to reopen.\n\nThe manpower needed to orchestrate the raids required a drastic reorganization of the Sheriff's Office. The office maxed out its overtime budget and billed the city millions more than it was allotted. Deputies were no longer able to fully attend to other responsibilities, according to a letter from New York City Comptroller Brad Lander to the City's Department of Finance.\n\nIn June 2024, the union filed another complaint against Miranda with the Office of Collective Bargaining and punctuated it with a demand: The sheriff needed to resign.\n\nIn September 2024, the City Council summoned Miranda to a hearing on marijuana legalization and Operation Padlock to Protect.\n\n\"In just a little over four months, the operation has conducted over 5,059 inspections,\" Miranda testified. \"The sheriff's joint compliance task force has sealed 1,078 locations, seized over $67 million in illicit products, and issued $104 million in civil penalties.\" Another statistic he dropped: Of the 1,124 padlock orders he issued, a judge threw out 208 of them, nearly 20%.\n\nDays later, Miranda was back in the headlines with local media reporting a city Department of Investigation probe into the sheriff, reportedly into the claims of improper cash seizures and the alleged protection-money racket.\n\nReporters asked Adams if he still had confidence in Miranda. \"He's doing the job that New York is asking him to do,\" the mayor said. \"This guy has closed down 1,100 smoke shops. Got $78 million of illegal cannabis off of our streets, not in the hands of our children and families. And so, why would I not have confidence?\" Hours later, Adams was hit with a federal indictment for alleged bribery — charges that would be dismissed after President Donald Trump took office.\n\nOn the same day of the indictment, the Department of Investigation was at the Sheriff's Office — to collect tens of thousands of dollars that had been mysteriously discovered there. In a statement about this visit, City Hall said Miranda learned of \"seemingly unvouchered cash held in safe boxes and self-reported the incident to his supervisors,\" who called in investigators. The provenance of the money has not been revealed.\n\nAs the days passed, pressure on Miranda continued to mount. That October 2, DOI asked Kahnauth for the names of clients whose cash was seized during the sweeps. Two city councilmembers fired off a letter asking Miranda to square his testimony that his office did not seize cash with \"subsequent public testimony and recent press coverage\" suggesting it had. They asked for a reply by October 18.\n\n\"To the best of my knowledge, the Sheriff's Office has not seized or vouchered any currency related to Operation Padlock to Protect; the NYPD is responsible for all seizures and vouchering of currency during the Operation,\" Miranda wrote in a letter on November 1. A spokesperson for DOI declined to comment. Its probe is ongoing.\n\nFollowing Zohran Mamdani's historic election as mayor, the sheriff's union took out a full-page ad in the New York Post featuring a picture of Miranda dressed as Woody from \"Toy Story.\"\n\n\"MAYOR-ELECT MAMDANI: YOUR NEW ADMINISTRATION NEEDS QUALIFIED LEADERS! SHADY SHERIFF ANTHONY MIRANDA IS NOT ONE OF THEM,\" it blares above a mock resume listing: \"No new contract negotiated with the union since 2022, 16 labor grievances, a hostile work environment, abuse of authority, tax liens and fines from the municipal government, lies to city council, retaliation against his employees, and civil rights violation lawsuits from approximately 40 smokes shops.\"\n\nIt's not clear whether the Mamdani transition team will keep Miranda on in his current role. In early December, the Sheriff sent a cryptic email that some deputies interpreted to mean his days might be numbered.\n\nWith the subject headline \"Protect Your Standards,\" Miranda implored his employees to \"address failures early and with clear direction\" and \"set firm boundaries so no one pulls you into improper conduct.\"\n\n\"One Final Thought,\" Miranda wrote. \"SILENCE AND TAKING NO ACTION IS ALSO A DECISION, AN ENABLING DECISION.\"\n\nTimmy Facciola reports on politics and striped bass at his Substack, The Judge Street Journal.",

    "description": "Former Meta chief AI scientist Yann LeCun said current and prospective CS students need to focus on skills \"with a long shelf life.\"",
    "fullText": "Yann LeCun said if computer science majors don't spend their time wisely, they may find out their degree doesn't add up.\n\n\"If you are a CS major and take the minimum required math courses for a typical CS curriculum, you might find yourself unable to adapt to major technological shifts,\" LeCun said in an email to Business Insider.\n\nLeCun, who teaches computer science at NYU, said during a recent podcast appearance that he jokes that he's \"a computer science professor arguing against studying computer science\" based on his push on where students should focus their time.\n\n\"My recommendation was not to avoid CS as a major but to take the maximum number of courses on foundations (e.g. math, physics, or EE courses) rather than take courses on the trendy technology du jour,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nThe former chief AI scientist at Meta said his advice is that students \"learn things with a long shelf life.\" Depending on the computer science program, not all of these skills may be baked into a degree.\n\n\"What we should do is learn kind of basic things in mathematics, in modeling, mathematics that can be connected with reality,\" LeCun said on \"The Information Bottleneck\" podcast. \"You tend to learn this kind of stuff in engineering in some schools that's linked with computer science, but sort of electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, et cetera.\"\n\nUniversities and computer science students continue to grapple with how to adapt their programs to the age of generative and increasingly agentic AI. Earlier this year, UC Berkeley professor Hany Farid described the struggle students face in finding jobs, compared to how graduates used to have \"the run of the place.\"\n\nLeaders in the field, including OpenAI's Bret Taylor, have stressed that computer science is about so much more than simply learning to code. Others, including Nobel Laureate Geoffrey Hinton, have stressed that learning critical thinking is what's the key to staying ahead of AI's advancements.\n\n\"Some skills that are always going to be valuable, like knowing some math, and some statistics, and some probability theory, knowing things like linear algebra that will always be valuable,\" Hinton recently told Business Insider. \"That's not knowledge that's going to disappear.\"\n\nLeCun jokingly pointed out that he did not initially study CS. He studied electrical engineering at ESIEE in Paris before earning a Ph.D. CS from the renowned Sorbonne Université in 1987. LeCun said some CS schools are linked to engineering programs, which tend to require more advanced math.\n\n\"Engineering disciplines, you know, in the US, you learn Calculus 1, 2, 3 that gives you a good basis, right?\" he said. In computer science, you can get away with just Calculus 1. That's not enough, right?\"\n\nEngineering also exposes students to concepts like control theory and signal processing, which LeCun said are \"really useful for things like AI.\"\n\nAll of this isn't to say basic programming should be thrown out, LeCun said. Vibe coding is nice, but it's not a substitute for fundamental knowledge.\n\n\"Obviously, you need to learn enough computer science to kind of program and use computers,\" he said. \"And even though AI is going to help you be more efficient at programming, you still need to know how to do this.\"",

    "title": "I give LinkedIn makeovers to executives. Here are 4 ways to brag more effectively on your profile.",
    "description": "Jillian Richardson offers professional LinkedIn makeovers, and she has 4 tips on how to brag more on your profile.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jillian Richardson, a 31-year-old ghostwriter for executives. She's based in Brooklyn. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm a ghostwriter focused on helping executives and founders grow their presence on LinkedIn.\n\nI offer LinkedIn profile polishes for executives, as well as people looking for a new job or trying out self-employment. After helping a number of people edit their profiles, one of my takeaways is that people need to brag more. They are not hyping themselves up nearly enough.\n\nLinkedIn is the place where it's socially acceptable to brag. The point is to discuss your career and where you're going next in life. LinkedIn is also a sea of people, and if you don't share what makes you unique, you won't stand out. People also assume you just need to share something about yourself once, and that's it, but things get lost on social media, so you can share the same thing a few times.\n\nI recently talked to a colleague, and we both have the same experience with ghostwriting clients. When they start posting more on LinkedIn, they'll receive a text from a friend calling them a try-hard or poking fun at them.\n\nThe idea that social media is not entirely real and only shows everyone's best side is what's called \"discernment.\" You're not going to be sharing every horrible moment of your life on social media. If you did, you probably wouldn't be in a super stable place. There are only parts of yourself that you want to share on the internet, and that's up to you. I wouldn't say that's inauthentic. That's just having boundaries.\n\nThere are a lot of places in the profile where the bragging — or lack of it — can show up. These are my suggestions to showcase your accomplishments more effectively:\n\nThe headline is one of the places people share accomplishments. I always recommend that when people write their headline, they think about using the language they would if they were speaking to an individual customer.\n\nYou want to use the headline to let the reader know how you can support them. Just write it as a single sentence. Don't use those divider lines that chop up everything because that's when people get carried away, and then they have 10 different accomplishments that don't connect to the person reading it.\n\nI can't tell you the number of founders I've talked to who literally don't have anything in their 'About' section. If I looked at their LinkedIn, I would assume their company doesn't even exist.\n\nIn the 'About' section, you should share statistics of how you help your customers. This is the place to really brag about how you help people succeed; why people should trust you; and what makes you different from other people in your industry. You should also use client case studies and share testimonials.\n\nI always recommend that people pin a newsletter, a landing page, or a website that brings people outside LinkedIn, where you can collect their email so you can be in contact with them in another place, and continue to have them get familiar with you.\n\nFor example, you could feature a social media moment that you had. Recently, I was featured in Forbes, so I have that there to look like I'm a trustworthy human being. Or, I can pin a LinkedIn post that performed really well to demonstrate my industry expertise.\n\nThe Recommendations section is located toward the bottom of the profile, and many people don't pay attention to it. However, people really look at this section when considering hiring someone. Many people already have testimonials on their website, so I usually suggest asking for recommendations from those people by saying something like, \"Hey, you said this exact thing to me. Would you be willing to copy and paste this on LinkedIn?\"\n\nOr, if somebody just said something nice to you on a call that they maybe didn't write down, just email them being like, \"Hey, I'm looking for recommendations on my LinkedIn. I remember you so generously said this thing. Would you be willing to copy and paste this as a LinkedIn recommendation?\"\n\nMost people will say yes, including a former boss or colleague. As long as you have a good relationship with them, why not reach out and ask? Everybody wants to see their team members succeed, hopefully.",

    "title": "Sundays are the new Mondays",
    "description": "Overachievers and anxious workers are turning the Sunday scaries into an extra day of work.",
    "fullText": "When freelance writer Sam Hindman sits down to work for a few hours on Sundays, she knows it will be quiet. There will be no pings and requests from her clients, no rush to meet an EOD deadline, and no scrambling. While logging hours on the weekend is typically more associated with overwork than freedom, Hindman says that locking in on a Sunday feels like liberation.\n\n\"I'm contributing to my future rest by allocating that time in a way that makes sense,\" she tells me. By working Sundays, she can justify a mid-morning workout Tuesday class or a long Thursday lunch break to meet up with her friend. The idea of work-life balance, Hindman says, has shifted for her from \"working and then clocking out and being done, into work melding and meshing and molding around your life.\"\n\nSlack, email, and smartphones had already made workers ever-reachable. Then the rise of remote work and Zoom during the pandemic further eroded the division between our work and all our other selves. Five years later, some are pushing to claw it back by skipping work on Fridays or drawing hard digital boundaries to silence afterhours messages and emails.\n\nBut another cohort of workers, a new type of white-collar weekend warrior, is embracing those blurred lines. Working a little here and there during the off days doesn't feel overworking, they tell me, but is a way to make the workweek work for them. They take those quiet hours to think creatively and deeply about their work without interruption, and they're all doing it voluntarily, embracing the idea that the strict boundaries of a 9 to 5 can be more restrictive than they are the sole practice of self preservation.\n\nFor many addled, anxious workers in today's addled, anxious white-collar economy, Sundays are the new Mondays.\n\nAs of last year, 5% of white-collar workers in the US logged on during the weekends, a 9% increase from 2023, according to an analysis of the habits of more than 200,000 employees and 777 companies conducted by ActivTrak, a workforce-analytics and productivity-software company. They clocked an average of about 5 hours and 30 minutes on Saturdays and Sundays, and those at mid-size companies of about 1,000 to 5,000 employees were the most likely to work weekends. In 2024, people with bachelor's degrees worked an average of four hours on a weekend, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and about 29% of all employed people worked on weekends.\n\nThe rise in weekend work comes as China's 996 culture — working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week — has taken hold in Silicon Valley. The lazy girl job era has given way to the locked-in era, and some AI companies demand long hours to compete. An analysis of corporate credit card use by Ramp, a business financial operations company, found an uptick in San Francisco on Saturdays of meals ordered from January to August of 2025 when compared to the same time in 2024.\n\nFor some, giving up some weekend hours is a way to carve out schedules that prioritize their families. Joey Sanford, a founding account executive at a startup, says he began working on weekends regularly after he had a baby two years ago. He knows he can be home for bedtime routines and to observe the Jewish Sabbath starting on Friday afternoons if he puts in more work at unconventional hours, like Saturday or Sunday nights, early mornings, and late nights. \"I actually think that by making soft boundaries, you can have extremely hard boundaries,\" he tells me. His team knows he will fully log off from sundown Friday to Saturday, but that he's dependable to meet at other odd hours and to get his heavy workload done. \"It's not that I ever feel forced to do it, it's that I want to do it.\"\n\nOthers say the weekends are their distraction-free days. A 2025 report from Microsoft found that workers experience some 275 distractions each day, or an interruption about every two minutes during the 9 to 5 workday. The average desk worker sits in meetings for nearly 15 hours a week in 2024, according to a survey from AI-powered calendar app Reclaim.ai. Cassaundra Kalba, who works in public relations, says she used to log on Saturday and Sunday mornings to do extra work and get ahead early in her career. That earned her praise from bosses, but it wasn't great for work-life balance. Now, she spends Sunday nights going through emails or getting some work done without distractions of meetings and notifications. \"It turned from something that started like, I want to be the best in this career, so I'm going to work often, to more so, this is actually setting me more up for success during the week.\"\n\nThe melding of work and personal time also is influenced by how people live. People are marrying and having children later in life, if at all, and spending more time alone than ever before. That can leave more hours open for putting in some extra work, and make career a priority. Lindsay Mahaney, who works in PR, doesn't take calls on weekends and strictly logs off when she takes her paid time off. But she's also a self-described workaholic, and tells me she has trouble turning the creative part of her work brain off. \"I'm passionate about what I do, and I want to do it well,\" Mahaney says. She might get ideas while on a run and take time on the weekend to jot it down, or spend Sunday evenings prepping for the week ahead. The \"creative part of the brain, it doesn't turn off.\"\n\nFanni Gabor, chief of flow (a modern twist on chief of staff) at a digital ID security company, tells me that her work is also her main life priority right now. \"I try to optimize for making sure that I spend my time that I care the most about learning and growing,\" she says. If that means spending weekends meeting with her CEO, who has become not just a boss but a mentor and friend, or doing deep work, that's fine. The tradeoff allows her to still exercise, eat healthy, and get enough sleep throughout the week, rather than burning out on a 996-like schedule and then crashing on empty on Sundays.\n\nIn a time when job security feels precarious, the idea of logging extra hours might feel forced. With grindset culture and a push to return to the office, the flexibility workers have carved out for themselves feels at risk. The people I spoke with for this story had a thread in common: They said they truly loved their work, and they weren't forced to live in this sort of always-on mindset, but felt that doing so gave them agency.\n\nTime is \"the limited resource,\" Gabor says. \"We can always make more money, but we don't have the exact same amount of time and we don't know how much we have left.\" For some, turning Sundays into Mondays might be the best way to take control of that time.\n\nAmanda Hoover is a senior correspondent at Business Insider covering the tech industry.

This is not a toe dip. At more than 8% of reported assets, this is now one of the fund’s core holdings, sitting alongside a handful of high-conviction names. That context matters because it suggests the volatility is not scaring the manager away. It is part of the thesis.\n\nThe disconnect is obvious in the numbers. In the third quarter, CCC Intelligent Solutions delivered revenue of $267.1 million, up 12% year over year, while adjusted EBITDA rose to $110.1 million, representing a 41% margin. Free cash flow reached $78.6 million for the quarter, and management lifted full-year guidance to as much as $1.056 billion in revenue and $428 million in adjusted EBITDA. The company also repurchased $44.9 million of stock during the quarter and has already used more than $217 million of its $300 million authorization year to date.\n\nFor patient investors, this is a stock the market cannot seem to agree on, but the business underneath continues to compound. Funds willing to sit through the swings are effectively betting that recurring revenue, entrenched customers, and cash generation eventually matter more than sentiment.",

    "fullText": "TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Kansas lawmakers are poised to vote Monday on a proposal that could lure the Kansas City Chiefs across the state line from Missouri, and replace popular but aging Arrowhead Stadium with a new facility capable of hosting major year-round events.\n\nThe meeting of the Legislative Coordinating Council, which includes the state's top lawmakers, is expected to be attended by Chiefs owner Clark Hunt and other team officials. If the proposal is passed, the Chiefs could move swiftly in announcing plans to depart their 53-year-old home at the Truman Sports Complex for a stadium that could cost upwards of $2 billion.\n\nThe state's proposal would allow for STAR bonds to be issued to cover up to 70% of the overall cost of the project. They would be paid off with state sales and liquor tax revenues generated in a defined area around around the sports complex.\n\nThe same bonding process was used to build Kansas Speedway and the surrounding shopping and entertainment district, known as The Legends, in Kansas City, Kansas — the area where a future stadium for the Chiefs is most likely to be built.\n\nThe area is also home to Children's Mercy Park, where Sporting Kansas City of Major League Soccer plays its home matches.\n\n“The state of Kansas is in active discussions with the Kansas City Chiefs about the prospects of building a new stadium and other facilities in Kansas,” the Kansas Department of Commerce said last week. “No final agreement has been reached, but this would be a massive economic win for Kansas and benefit Kansans for generations to come. We are aggressively pursuing this opportunity.”\n\nThe move by the Chiefs would be a massive blow to Missouri lawmakers and Gov. Mike Kehoe, who have been working on a package of their own to prevent a second NFL franchise in a decade from leaving their borders. The Rams departed St. Louis for Los Angeles a decade ago in part because of their inability to secure funding to help replace The Dome at America’s Center.\n\nKehoe backed a special legislative session in June to authorize bonds covering up to 50% of the cost of new or renovated stadiums, plus up to $50 million of tax credits for each stadium and unspecified aid from local governments.\n\nThe special session came in response to Kansas lawmakers approving their bond package.\n\nThe Chiefs originally planned an $800 million renovation of Arrowhead Stadium in a joint effort with the Kansas City Royals, who are similarly planning to build a new facility to replace Kauffman Stadium — which sits a couple of hundred yards across a parking lot from Arrowhead Stadium — when the two teams' leases with Jackson County, Missouri, expire in January 2031.\n\nBut after county voters soundly defeated a local sales tax extension last year, the Royals and Chiefs began work on separate plans.\n\nThe Royals will not be discussed by Kansas lawmakers Monday, but momentum appears to be building behind their own move across the state line. An affiliate of the club already has purchased the mortgage on a tract of land in Overland Park, Kansas.\n\nQuinton Lucas, the mayor of Kansas City, Missouri, has been working to keep both franchises on the Missouri side of the state line. He said in a statement over the weekend that negotiations had continued with the Chiefs throughout last week.\n\n“We’ll reserve further comment until we hear from the Kansas City Chiefs,” Lucas said.\n\nHunt has long said his preference was to renovate Arrowhead Stadium, which was beloved by his father and team founder, the late Lamar Hunt. It is considered one of the jewels of the NFL, alongside Lambeau Field in Green Bay, and is revered for its tailgating scene and home-field advantage; it currently holds the Guinness World Record for the loudest stadium roar.\n\nThis summer, Arrowhead Stadium will host six World Cup matches, including matches in the Round of 32 and quarterfinals.\n\nThe Hunt family has warmed in recent years to the idea of leaving their own mark by building its replacement, though. Not only would a new, state-of-the-art stadium provide new revenue streams, through luxury seating and accompanying development, but a fixed or retractable roof would allow it to be used year-round. That would mean the potential to host concerts and events, college football bowl games, the Final Four and one of Lamar Hunt's long-held dreams: a Super Bowl.\n\nHanna reported from Topeka.

    "fullText": "Raphinha’s influence in the current Barcelona setup is no longer up for debate.\n\nWhile the team managed to collect results during his absence earlier in the season, his return to the starting XI has clearly altered the rhythm, balance, and intensity of the side.\n\nThe Brazilian winger has brought back elements that were quietly missing, particularly in pressing, transitions, and collective effort without the ball.\n\nIn the weeks Raphinha spent sidelined through injury, Barcelona continued to win, but there was a noticeable drop in the sharpness of the frontline press.\n\nCertain attacking movements looked slower, and the overall aggression that defined last season’s best performances was reduced.\n\nAs such, the structure was still there, but the edge was not.\n\nSince his return, the contrast has been striking, and Barcelona’s results tell part of the story, with eight wins and just one defeat since he came back into the squad.\n\nMore tellingly, when Raphinha has started, the record is perfect – five wins from five games, with the forward scoring four goals and one assist.\n\nRaphiniha was decisive against Villarreal. (Photo by Alex Caparros/Getty Images)\n\nNow, it would be unfair to criticise Marcus Rashford, who performed well during Raphinha’s absence.\n\nHowever, the Brazilian offers something different. Defensively, he is more intense. Tactically, he is more disciplined. And emotionally, he brings an edge that lifts the collective effort.\n\nThe recent clash against Villarreal was a perfect example. Raphinha played with one gear more than everyone else.\n\nHe was aggressive in transitions, relentless in duels, and constantly driving the team forward. He pressed, chased, recovered, and fought every battle as if it were the last.\n\nHis influence was decisive in the opening goal and from that moment on, he never stopped.\n\nThis version of Raphinha is one of the main reasons why the mood around Barcelona has shifted so quickly.\n\nIn just one month, the performances feel more complete and the team arguably looks more connected.",

He is one of the best around at the moment.\n\n\"At the start of the season, Villa fans were booing him because he'd had his head turned! You have to give credit to Emery as manager here for backing him.\n\n\"He didn't take him out of the squad, he left him in there to deal with the pressure. That has taken him to a different level, along with some other players, and you can see Rogers is excited to play because he just glides past players.\n\n\"I would pay good money every week to go and watch him - that is how good he is. \"\n\nListen to the Football Daily podcast on BBC Sounds",

    "fullText": "Barcelona continued their scintillating La Liga form with a 2-0 victory over Villarreal in their final match of 2025. Goals from Raphinha and Lamine Yamal made it eight league wins in a row for the Catalans, who end the year with a four-point lead in the standings.\n\nThe match saw Frenkie de Jong make his return to the starting line-up after a number of weeks on the bench, and he was one of the standouts for Barcelona. As per Sport, he gave his reaction the victory in the mixed zone.\n\n“I’m very happy. We closed the year as leaders, which was the objective. Villarreal come out quickly on the counter and have dangerous players. I felt that we were superior. It was a well-deserved victory. We’re fine. Now is not the time for titles, but we are alive in everything.”\n\nJoan Garcia produced another impressive showing on his way to a clean sheet, and the Barcelona goalkeeper also spoke on the match to the club’s official media channels (via MD).\n\n“We knew it was very important to get the three points in the last game of the year. We have achieved it and we finished top in this first half of the season. There is still a long way to go but we had this objective and we have achieved it.\n\n“When a team is down one player, it always makes things easier for you. We would have liked to kill the game earlier and score the second before and then make a third, but they played very well and knew how to defend with ten men. The important thing is that we got the three points and kept a clean sheet.\n\n“I try to stop the ones that come to me. There are days when I can do it and others I can’t. Today, luckily, we got a clean sheet and I’m very happy.”\n\nGerard Martin also spoke to the media after the match at La Ceramica, and as per MD, he expressed pride over Barcelona’s growth in recent months.\n\n“We have grown a lot since the beginning of the season. We have improved in many things and it is showing in recent games. Villarreal are a difficult team and a difficult ground. We knew they hadn’t lost and it was important to win because we were at the top of the standings. It seems like an easy game, but it was complicated.”",

And now, we have a better idea of what prompted the incident, courtesy of the fan who was attacked.\n\nDuring the Week 16 matchup, the Detroit Free Press spoke with Ryan Kennedy, the fan involved in the altercation with Metcalf, who shared what he said that triggered the crashout seen around the world — calling the Steelers wide receiver by his full name, DeKaylin Zecharius Metcalf.\n\n“He doesn’t like his government name. I called him that and then he grabbed me and ripped my shirt,” Kennedy said via the Detroit Free Press. “I’m a little shocked. Like, everyone’s talking to me. I’m a little rattled, but I just want the Lions to win, baby.”\n\nWith around three minutes remaining in the second quarter, Metcalf was captured grabbing Kennedy, then forcefully shoving him back after the two exchanged words.\n\nThe NFL clarified that Metcalf couldn’t be ejected due to no flag being thrown, but they are investigating the incident, and he could face discipline from the league.\n\nFor up-to-date Steelers coverage, \n\nThis article originally appeared on Steelers Wire: Steelers' DK Metcalf-fan altercation receives strange update",

    "description": "Isak Injury Raises January Signings Questions for LiverpoolLiverpool are facing an uncomfortable period of uncertainty after concerns emerged over the fitness of Alexander Isak, with early indications...",
    "fullText": "Liverpool are facing an uncomfortable period of uncertainty after concerns emerged over the fitness of Alexander Isak, with early indications suggesting the striker could be sidelined for a significant period. While the full extent of the injury is still being assessed, the situation has already sharpened internal discussions around January signings and squad depth during a decisive phase of the season.\n\nIsak’s injury arrives at an awkward moment. Liverpool have invested heavily in attacking options over the past year, yet circumstances have shifted quickly. Injuries, suspensions and international commitments are converging, leaving the club exposed in areas that were expected to be well covered. The coming days, particularly the results of further medical examinations, will play a critical role in shaping Liverpool’s strategy for the winter transfer window.\n\nThere is a deliberate sense of caution around Isak’s condition. Liverpool are waiting for comprehensive scan results before forming a definitive prognosis, but early concern within the club suggests the issue may not be short-term. The striker was visibly distressed when leaving the pitch, and staff were immediately aware that the injury could carry broader implications beyond one match or even one month.\n\nSince his arrival, Isak’s time on Merseyside has already been disrupted by physical setbacks. Another prolonged absence would not only slow his own adaptation but also place additional strain on a forward line that is already being reshaped week by week. Liverpool’s medical team are understood to be taking a conservative approach, prioritising long-term recovery over any rushed return.\n\nLiverpool had been monitoring the January market even before Isak’s injury, but the urgency has increased according to the Telegraph. Recruitment staff are actively reviewing options who could provide immediate cover across the front line, particularly players capable of operating in multiple attacking roles. Flexibility is seen as essential, given the unpredictable nature of injuries and suspensions during the second half of the campaign.\n\nWhile no final decision has been taken, the possibility of January signings is firmly on the table. Liverpool are unlikely to make reactive or inflated deals, yet there is an acceptance internally that the squad may require reinforcement to sustain momentum domestically and in Europe. Financially, the club retains scope to act, having planned prudently despite substantial recent expenditure.\n\nThe preference would be for a player who can contribute straight away rather than a long-term project. Availability, fitness history and adaptability to the Premier League are all being weighed carefully as part of the assessment process.\n\nIsak’s injury is not an isolated issue. Liverpool are managing a growing list of absentees, with several players either unavailable or facing enforced breaks due to suspension and international duty. This congestion is placing additional responsibility on a relatively small group of attackers, increasing the risk of fatigue and further injuries.\n\nFrom a tactical perspective, the coaching staff are already exploring short-term adjustments to manage workloads and maintain attacking output. However, internal belief remains that structural solutions, rather than temporary fixes, may be required if Isak is ruled out for an extended period.\n\nThe January schedule offers little margin for error. League fixtures, cup commitments and the broader demands of a title challenge mean Liverpool cannot afford a prolonged dip in attacking efficiency.\n\nMuch depends on the clarity that emerges from Isak’s medical assessment. A minor setback would likely see Liverpool hold their position and trust the depth already in place. A more serious diagnosis, however, would almost certainly accelerate plans around January signings.\n\nLiverpool’s approach remains calm and methodical. There is no appetite for panic, but there is also a recognition that inaction carries its own risks. The balance between patience and decisiveness will define their winter strategy, with Isak’s injury acting as the central variable.\n\nFor now, the club wait. Yet behind the scenes, preparations are being made to ensure Liverpool are not left short-handed should the worst-case scenario materialise.",

    "fullText": "A much-needed outburst has arrived from the depths of the Allianz Stadium.\n\nGian Piero Gasperini, unrestrained in his words, had a lengthy meeting with Sporting Director Massara, where he laid out in detail all the squad’s needs.\n\nRoma, in fact, isn’t as competitive as the Grugliasco-born coach would like, and in four months of the season, they’ve lost virtually all their head-to-head matches.\n\nHence the need to raise his voice and make it clear that four or five players on the market are needed who can raise the bar and enhance the squad’s quality.\n\nNot just the attack, therefore, but also a midfielder and a defender.\n\nGasperini was all too clear, and on Saturday he prefaced everything to Massara, which he later emphasized repeatedly in front of the cameras.\n\nRoma, writes Il Corriere dello Sport, needs to renew itself, and quickly. The goal is to return to the Champions League after seven years, and the Giallorossi coach wants to repay the faith that the Friedkins and the fans have placed in him.\n\nThe ideas, therefore, are quite clear. Gasp is now waiting for action, with Massara accelerating moves for Zirkzee and Raspadori and also working on finding a new home for Dovbyk. Bailey and Ferguson, on the other hand, are expected to return to Aston Villa and Brighton, respectively.",

    "fullText": "Roma are accelerating, and they’re following a very clear path: sending a strong signal to Gian Piero Gasperini right away.\n\nKeeping him calm—and above all, confident—also depends on the transfer market, and the first name circled in red is Giacomo Raspadori.\n\nThe Atlético Madrid striker has been a target for the Giallorossi manager for years, dating back to his time at Atalanta, and now he could become the first real signing of the winter.\n\nBetween today and tomorrow, Gazzetta dello Sport reports, Massara will make a decisive move, with contacts already scheduled with both the player’s entourage and the Spanish club, to determine if the deal can be completed quickly.\n\nAccording to La Repubblica, an agreement could be reached as early as today.\n\nIn Madrid, Raspadori hasn’t found the playing time he expected. The Colchoneros’ investment was significant, but his performance and playing time aren’t living up to expectations. Hence the openness to a different solution, with Roma moving ahead, initiating initial discussions at the end of last month.\n\nNow, however, the matter has entered the heated phase. The formula is a loan with an option to buy set at €20 million, a proposal that Trigoria believes is sustainable and could satisfy both parties.\n\nAtlético, for their part, is pushing for conditions that would transform the option into an obligation, tying it to the player’s number of appearances. This is the final hurdle to unravel: once the right fit is found, the deal can truly take off.",

    "fullText": "It was telling Rob Edwards referenced the importance of his players showing more character during their home games in the build-up to Brentford.\n\nIn his eyes, Wolves' best performances since taking charge have come during away defeats at Aston Villa and Arsenal. Both were tight matches where you could argue, on another day, they could have earned a point.\n\nThe reality is draws won't get Wolves out of their current predicament. Wins, and I stress the plural, are the only way mere talk of survival isn't greeted with laughter.\n\nWe all know teams are more likely to win at home. However, we also quite often see struggling sides can feel more comfortable on the road.\n\nJorgen Strand-Larsen's missed penalty was a clear example of a player fighting against the 'weight' of the gold and black shirt. Four months ago Newcastle had bids of £50m and £55m for the striker rejected. In the here and now he has one Premier League goal to his name this season, ironically, a spot kick he managed to convert two months earlier against Burnley.\n\nThe limited confidence the Norwegian currently has will have been further eroded after he was mocked by some sections of the home support who chanted in anger following his failure to convert from 12 yards. Molineux at times felt like a roman colosseum, with bloodthirsty fans desperate for a scapegoat, even more so following the departure of Jeff Shi.\n\nAt the other end of the fan vitriol scale is Mateus Mane. At 18-years of age, with just a handful of Premier League appearances to his name, Edwards said to me post-match he clearly lacks the \"scars\" some of his older and more experienced team-mates are currently carrying.\n\nAfter coming on in the 65th minute, the academy product was always positive - not only willing to test defenders and showcase his skill set, he also chased down a lost cause down near the corner flag, which resulted in not only winning the ball back but his subsequent cross led to Wolves a chance.\n\nUnderstandably keen to impress, I was struck by the frequency in which he raised his hand to receive the ball. He wanted to make a difference, and it was his first-time delivery into the box which led to Wolves being awarded a penalty.\n\nIn stark contrast to the treatment dished out to Strand-Larsen, once the full-time whistle had blown, Mane stood and applauded the Sir Jack Haywood stand as the small number of fans still in their seats sang his name back to him.\n\nEdwards told me afterwards supporters can expect to see more of Mane in the coming weeks but Wolves will need much more than the innocence of youth if they want to fend off the inevitable comparisons to the infamous Derby County Premier League campaign of 2007-2008.",

    "fullText": "It has been nine months since Dani Alaves was acquitted on a charge of rape, having successful appealed the original verdict in February 2024. The former Barcelona defender, who recently reappeared as a preacher, is now said to be planning his return to football.\n\nDani Alves last played a professional match in January 2023, days before he was arrested on suspicion of rape following an incident that took place weeks prior. Pumas, his then-club, cancelled his contract upon the news, which means that he has not featured for almost three years.\n\nHowever, it has now been reported by ESPN Brazil (via Marca) that Alves intends to return to football as a player. The 42-year-old, who is still under investigation for rape after the Prosecutor’s Office filed an appeal against his acquitting, is close to purchasing Portuguese third tier side São João de Ver alongside a group of investors, and his plan is to register himself as one of their players once negotiations are finalised.\n\nAlves intends to “sign” for São João de Ver in January, and thus, play the second half of the season with his new club. He would then officially retire from football, before moving into a full-time role as owner.\n\nProvided that a deal is completed, Alves would follow in the footsteps of Vinicius by purchasing a Portuguese club. The Real Madrid man is an investor in the consortium that bought Alverca earlier this year, and the then-second division were promoted to the Liga Portugal at the end of last season.\n\nAlvera currently occupy a very respectable 10th place in the Liga Portugal, ahead of established clubs such as Rio Ave and Santa Clara. Alves will be hoping that he can lead his new club to similar heights in the coming years.",

    "fullText": "Is there any way this season can simply end?\n\nNo, there is not. The Washington Commanders will need to find a way to get through the final two games and see if they can get some players back healthy.\n\nQuarterback Marcus Mariota is battling with an injured quad and hand. Head coach Dan Quinn told the media on Sunday that they may even need to sign a quarterback to help them finish the season.\n\n\"It was [a] cleat that got to his hand on the top,\" Quinn said. \"But I don't know yet. It's swollen. I'd say we're going to, you know, call it day-to-day right now, of where it's at both with the hand and with the quad. And so, let's see what tomorrow is, and the following day. Then I'd say by two days from now, we'll have a very good estimate of where he is.\"\n\nThough Quinn didn't rule out needing to sign another quarterback, he did go ahead and rule out playing Jayden Daniels, the team's starting quarterback, in either of the final two games (Dallas, at Philadelphia). \"We would not consider playing Jayden. So, the first two options are the ones you were leading into of [QB] Josh [Johnson] and [QB] Sam [Hartman]. Would we consider somebody else coming in if he's not able to? Yeah, all those are on the table. That's something that [General Manager] Adam [Peters] and I are discussing tonight, and we did today. But yeah, option A and B, as you had said, but not C.\"\n\nJohnson is simply way beyond his best years, and Hartman? Did you see him in the preseason games? Yet, the Commanders chose to keep Hartman instead of looking elsewhere all season.\n\nQuinn certainly doesn't want to go out and sign a quarterback, bring him to Ashburn, and have him learn to play, if needed, in these final two weeks. You talk about difficult. It's difficult enough to find anyone who can play any position, but you actually think you might consider it for the final two weeks of an NFL regular season? Remember, this is a short week for Washington, which plays the Dallas Cowboys on Christmas Day [Thursday].\n\n\"I think it'd be difficult at any spot, but I think we're looking, let's see where Marcus is, where are we looking for the next two games too. So, that was really kind of our thought behind the discussions of where we are. I would say difficult, not impossible, but definitely difficult. I think we just saw somebody do it last week or two weeks ago pretty quickly. Not on our team [laughs], but I did see it happening. I was pretty impressed by it.\"\n\nYes, this is an NFL season many a Commanders fan might simply wish they could wake up and find this season had all been a bad dream... a really bad dream.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: Who will start at quarterback on Christmas Day?",

    "description": "A practical guide to installing Void Linux on an encrypted ZFS root with LUKS-encrypted swap and working hibernation support.",
    "fullText": "FreeBSD continues to make strides in desktop support, but Linux still holds an advantage in hardware compatibility. After running openSUSE Tumbleweed on my mini PC for several months, I decided it was time to switch to a solution I could control more closely. Not because Tumbleweed doesn't work well - it works great! - but I prefer having direct control over what happens on my machine. And I want native ZFS, because I prefer it over btrfs and it allows me to manage snapshots, backups, and rollbacks just as I do on FreeBSD, using the same tools and procedures.\n\nThe choice of Void Linux comes from its BSD-like approach: modular and free of unnecessary complexity. This makes it an excellent solution for this type of setup.\n\nZFSBootMenu is an extremely powerful tool. It provides an experience similar to FreeBSD's boot loader and natively supports ZFS. I strongly recommend reading the documentation and exploring its features, as some of them - like the built-in SSH daemon - can be genuine lifesavers in recovery scenarios.\n\nThis guide is not for absolute beginners. If you're new to Linux or Unix-like operating systems, you'd be better served by a ready-to-use distribution like openSUSE Leap (or Tumbleweed for a rolling distribution), Linux Mint, Debian, Ubuntu, or Manjaro. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate a stable, upgradeable, and reasonably secure base setup for users already comfortable with system administration. It uses the glibc variant of Void Linux. The musl version requires different commands, for example for locale generation.\n\nThis guide synthesizes instructions from several sources:\n\nIf your setup differs from what's described here (NVMe disk, UEFI boot, Secure Boot disabled), consult the linked guides for explanations and variations.\n\nIf you want to reproduce this setup quickly, I maintain a script that automates the procedure described in this guide: disk partitioning, ZFS pool and dataset creation, encrypted swap for hibernation resume, dracut configuration, and ZFSBootMenu EFI setup. An optional KDE Plasma desktop installation is also supported.\n\nThe script is interactive and will ask for the required parameters (target disk, timezone and keymap, passphrases, desktop options). Requirements, usage instructions, and known limitations are documented in the repository README\n\nThat said, I still recommend going through the manual process at least once. Understanding each step is part of the value of this setup, especially when troubleshooting or adapting it to different hardware.\n\nSince ZFS isn't supported by the base Void Linux image, we'll use hrmpf, an excellent rescue system based on Void Linux that includes ZFS support out of the box.\n\nAfter booting, you can either proceed directly or SSH into the machine to continue remotely. I generally prefer SSH since it makes copy-paste operations much easier - especially when dealing with UUIDs and long commands. To enable SSH access, set a root password and allow root login:\n\nEdit /etc/ssh/sshd_config and enable:\n\nYou can now connect via SSH from another device.\n\nSet up the environment variables and generate a host ID - we need it for ZFS:\n\nIdentify your target disk and set up the partition variables. This approach keeps everything consistent and reduces errors:\n\nVerify your configuration before proceeding:\n\nWarning: This operation will irreversibly destroy all data on the selected disk. Double-check that you've selected the correct disk and be sure to have a complete backup of your system!\n\nIf you're not using UEFI boot, adapt this procedure following the appropriate guide linked at the beginning of this post:\n\nThe swap partition should be slightly larger than your RAM to support hibernation. When you hibernate, the entire contents of RAM are written to swap, so you need enough space to hold it all plus some overhead. In this example, I have 16 GB of RAM, so I'm creating an 18 GB swap partition:\n\nEncrypting the disk is strongly recommended, especially for laptops. Replace SomeKeyphrase with a strong passphrase that's easy to type. Keep in mind that during early boot, the keyboard layout might default to US, so choose a passphrase that's easy to type on a US keyboard layout:\n\nCreate the pool with conservative, well-tested options:\n\nCopy the files we generated earlier to the new system:\n\nNow we'll set up the encrypted swap partition. This is where the hibernation magic happens - by using a separate LUKS-encrypted partition instead of a ZFS zvol, we can properly resume from hibernation.\n\nFormat the swap partition with LUKS:\n\nOpen the encrypted partition, create the swap filesystem, and activate it:\n\nBefore entering the chroot, save the disk variables so they remain available inside the new environment:\n\nFrom this point forward, all commands are executed inside the new system.\n\nFirst, load the saved variables:\n\nAdd the swap entry to /etc/fstab:\n\nTo avoid entering the swap password separately after unlocking the ZFS pool, we'll create a keyfile stored on the encrypted ZFS dataset. This is secure because the keyfile only becomes accessible after the ZFS pool is unlocked.\n\nFirst, install cryptsetup in the new system:\n\nGenerate a random keyfile and add it to the LUKS partition:\n\nAdd the keyfile to /etc/crypttab:\n\nInclude the keyfile and crypttab in the initramfs. Create /etc/dracut.conf.d/10-crypt.conf:\n\nConfigure keyboard layout and hardware clock. Adjust the keymap and timezone to match your location:\n\nNow we need to configure hibernation resume. This is the key insight that makes this setup work: normally, the encrypted ZFS root mounts first, and then it unlocks the swap partition. But when resuming from hibernation, the kernel needs to read the hibernation image from swap before mounting the root filesystem - otherwise, the saved state would be lost.\n\nTo solve this, we tell ZFSBootMenu to unlock the swap partition early, before mounting ZFS, by specifying its LUKS UUID.\n\nGet the UUID of your swap partition:\n\nStore the UUID in a variable for the next step:\n\nNow set the boot parameters using the captured UUID:\n\nCreate and mount the EFI partition:\n\nAdd the EFI partition to /etc/fstab using its UUID:\n\nConfigure the EFI boot entries:\n\nVoid Linux is modular, so you may need to install additional packages for your specific hardware. For the Intel microcode, you need the non-free repo: For example:\n\nAfter installing microcode updates, regenerate the boot images and exit:\n\nIf all you need is a minimal system or a server, you're done and ready to reboot. For a complete desktop environment, continue with the following steps.\n\nFor desktop use, create a non-root user with appropriate group memberships. Replace username with your desired username.\n\nxchroot will bind mount /etc/resolv.conf and leave an empty file. Network Manager won't like it. So let's clean it up:\n\nIf everything went well, after entering your ZFS encryption password, you'll be greeted by the SDDM login screen.\n\nTo verify that hibernation works correctly, you can clock the \"Hibernate\" button or:\n\nThe system should power off. When you turn it back on, ZFSBootMenu will prompt for the password, unlock the swap partition, detect the hibernation image, and resume your session exactly where you left off.\n\nIf resume fails, check that: 1. The LUKS UUID in the ZFS commandline property matches your swap partition 2. The swap partition is large enough for your RAM 3. The dracut configuration includes the crypttab and keyfile\n\nYou now have a fully functional Void Linux system with native ZFS, full disk encryption, and working hibernation. The system is rolling, lightweight, and easy to maintain. Enjoy!",

    "fullText": "Sonair has hit a major milestone: our ADAR firmware now compiles with the latest beta of Ferrocene, moving us closer to safety certification. This keeps us on track to deliver certified, high-performance sensing for autonomous robotics.\n\nSonair can now compile ADAR firmware using the 26.02.00 beta release of Ferrocene, Ferrous Systems’ certified rust compiler and subset of the Rust core library (libcore). Ferrocene 25.11.00 has already been assessed by TÜV SÜD for compliance with IEC 61508 (SIL2), and  26.02.00 (expected early 2026) will expand the certified subset of libcore, giving us all the functionality we need to formally certify our firmware.\n\nThe milestone means Sonair remains on track to achieve safety certification of ADAR.\n\nLibcore is the low‑level library that provides the fundamental “toolbox” Rust programmers build on, especially for no_std and embedded applications. Since libcore has a lot of functionality that will take time to be safety certified, Ferrous has certified a subset of libcore. The first release of a certified subset arrived in the beginning of December. It was still missing functionality we needed for our firmware. The coming version, however, will include everything Sonair needs to complete the job.\n\nWe’ve worked closely with Ferrous Systems in an iterative process to identify the functionality we need from the libcore toolbox and to test beta versions. Ferrous Systems has adopted new techniques that significantly speed up the process, enabling us to reach our deadlines. Sonair views libcore as the foundation of our software “tower.” Without a solid, certified foundation, even well‑designed upper layers might collapse under certification scrutiny or unexpected failure.",

    "fullText": "Japanese authorities have approved a decision to restart the world’s biggest nuclear power plant, which has sat dormant for more than a decade following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, in a pivotal moment as the country looks to looks to shift its energy supply away from fossil fuels.\n\nDespite nerves from many local residents, the Niigata prefectural assembly, home to the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant, approved a bill on Monday that clears the way for utility company Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) to restart one of the plant’s seven reactors.\n\nThe company plans to bring the No. 6 reactor back online around January 20, Japan’s public broadcaster NHK reported.\n\nJapan has taken a cautious approach to nuclear energy since a massive 9.0-magnitude earthquake and tsunami in 2011 triggered a nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. It was the world’s worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986.\n\nFollowing the disaster, Japan shut down all 54 of its nuclear power stations including Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, which sits in the coastal and port region of Niigata about 320 kilometers (200 miles) north of Tokyo on Japan’s main island of Honshu.\n\nJapan has since restarted 14 of the 33 nuclear reactors that remain operable, according to the World Nuclear Association.\n\nThe Niigata plant will be the first to reopen under the operation of TEPCO, the company that ran the Fukushima Daiichi power station. It has been trying to reassure residents of the restart plan is safe.\n\n“We remain firmly committed to never repeating such an accident and ensuring Niigata residents never experience anything similar,” said TEPCO spokesperson Masakatsu Takata, Reuters news agency reported.\n\nBefore the Fukushima disaster, Japan’s nuclear reactors had provided around 30% of the country’s electricity. Since then, Japan has increased its reliance on costly imported fossil fuels, including coal and gas, to power the country and keep the lights on.\n\nAbout 60–70% of Japan’s power generation comes from imported fossil fuels, which cost the country about 10.7 trillion yen ($68 billion) last year alone.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who took office two months ago, is a strong proponent of nuclear power and has pushed to revive the crippled industry to drive down costs, and tackle inflation and a stagnant economy.\n\nJapan is the world’s fifth-largest emitter of carbon dioxide, after China, the United States, India and Russia, according to the International Energy Agency. But it has committed to reaching net zero emissions by 2050, and renewable energy was at the center of its latest energy plan published earlier this year, with a push for greater investments in solar and wind.\n\nThe country’s energy demands are also expected to increase in the coming years due to a boom in energy-hungry data centers that power AI infrastructure.\n\nTo achieve its energy and climate goals, Japan aims to double the share of nuclear power in its electricity mix to 20% by 2040.\n\nBut the memory of the Fukushima disaster endures, and some local residents are wary of reviving nuclear power due to safety concerns.\n\n“We know firsthand the risk of a nuclear accident and cannot dismiss it,” Ayako Oga, 52, told Reuters. Oga had settled in Niigata after fleeing the Fukushima disaster. She told the news agency that her old home was inside the exclusion zone and she still struggles with post-traumatic stress-like symptoms.\n\nA survey published by the Niigata prefecture in October found 60% of residents did not think conditions for the restart had been met. Nearly 70% were worried about TEPCO operating the plant, Reuters reported.\n\nOn its website, TEPCO said Kashiwazaki-Kariwa had undergone multiple inspections and upgrades and that the company had learned “the lessons of Fukushima.”\n\nThe company said new seawalls and watertight doors would provide “stronger protection against tsunamis” and that mobile generators and more fire trucks would be on hand for “cooling support” in an emergency. It also said the plant now had “upgraded filtering systems designed to control the spread of radioactive materials.”\n\nIn late October, TEPCO conducted “a full round of integrity checks” at Unit 6 and declared the reactor fit for startup.",

    "fullText": "With the planned \"digital omnibus\" package, the EU Commission promises a breakthrough against bureaucracy. However, resistance to the initiative is constantly growing. Legal experts from the law firm Spirit Legal are now urgently warning in an expert opinion commissioned by the Federation of German Consumer Organisations (vzbv) that the draft represents a systematic break with the principles of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and endangers the privacy of hundreds of millions of consumers.\n\nAt the center of the criticism is the planned Article 88c, which provides for special relief for data processing in the context of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The experts Peter Hense and David Wagner warn here of an \"unlimited special legal zone\". Since the term \"AI system\" is extremely broadly defined, companies could in the future declare almost any automated data processing as AI-relevant in order to evade strict data protection rules. This would replace the technology-neutral logic of the GDPR with a technology-specific privilege that primarily benefits service providers.\n\nThe lawyers consider the planned relaxation in handling sensitive data such as health information or political views to be alarming. The draft suggests that their processing is all the more justified the larger the data volumes are. This reverses the principle of data minimization: mass data extraction is rewarded as long as it serves to train AI models. The experts see this as dangerous privileges for Big Tech corporations.\n\nThe authors also criticize that essential protective mechanisms are merely shifted to the legally non-binding recitals. One example is technical opt-out procedures with which users can object to the use of their data. Without anchoring in the binding legal text, supervisory authorities lack the means to effectively sanction violations. Especially with web scraping, data of individuals would be collected who often have no opportunity to even become aware of their right of objection.\n\nTo counteract these negative developments, the experts propose a specific legal basis for AI training. Companies should only be allowed to access personal information if they can prove that their goal cannot be achieved with anonymized or synthetic data. Furthermore, it must be ensured that AI models do not reproduce personal information in their answers (\"Data Leakage\"). Strict technical standards are therefore necessary already in the training process.\n\nA chapter is dedicated to the protection of vulnerable groups. Since minors frequently cannot grasp the implications of data processing for AI, the authors advocate for explicit parental consent. In addition, individuals reaching the age of majority should receive an unconditional right to prohibit the further use of their data in existing models. Without such guardrails, the digital sovereignty of the next-generation risks being permanently lost.\n\nAccording to vzbv board member Ramona Pop, the political dimension of these findings is enormous. She warns that the Commission, under the guise of innovation, primarily wants to issue a free pass to US platforms. Big Tech could easily exploit legal grey areas, while European companies and consumers would be left behind. True legal certainty can only be achieved through clear rules. Brussels, on the other hand, is proposing vague exceptions that would have to be judicially clarified over years.\n\nCurrent results of a representative online survey for the vzbv demonstrate that data protection is not a hindrance but an economic factor. According to the survey, trust is the fundamental prerequisite for using digital services for 87 percent of consumers. The GDPR serves as an important anchor: over 60 percent of respondents are more likely to trust companies if they demonstrably comply with European regulations. A dilution of these standards thus also risks the social acceptance of new technologies.\n\nThe Digital Omnibus will now be discussed in the EU Council and Parliament. The objections from civil society can hardly be ignored. The package is suspected of being primarily the result of massive pressure from the US government, rather than representing European citizen and economic interests. The rights of data subjects are being weakened under the guise of \"simplifications,\" it is said. The Commission wants to issue AI companies a blank check to extract European data.\n\nDon't miss any news – Facebook,\n LinkedIn or\n Mastodon.\n\nThis article was originally published in\n\n German.\n\n It was translated with technical assistance and editorially reviewed before publication.",

    "fullText": "Over 115,000 WatchGuard Firebox devices exposed online remain unpatched against a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability actively exploited in attacks.\n\nThe security flaw, tracked as CVE-2025-14733, affects Firebox firewalls running Fireware OS 11.x and later (including 11.12.4_Update1), 12.x or later (including 12.11.5), and 2025.1 up to and including 2025.1.3.\n\nSuccessful exploitation enables unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code remotely on vulnerable devices, following low-complexity attacks that don't require user interaction.\n\nAs WatchGuard explained in a Thursday advisory, when it released CVE-2025-14733 security updates and tagged it as exploited in the wild, unpatched Firebox firewalls are only vulnerable to attacks if configured for IKEv2 VPN. It also warned that even if vulnerable configurations are removed, the firewall may still be at risk if a Branch Office VPN (BOVPN) to a static gateway peer is still configured.\n\n\"WatchGuard Fireware OS iked process contains an out of bounds write vulnerability in the OS iked process,\" an NVD advisory explains. \"This vulnerability may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code and affects both the mobile user VPN with IKEv2 and the branch office VPN using IKEv2 when configured with a dynamic gateway peer.\"\n\nWatchGuard has shared indicators of compromise to help customers identify compromised Firebox appliances on their network, advising those who find signs of malicious activity to rotate all locally stored secrets on vulnerable firewalls. It also provided a temporary workaround for network defenders who can't immediately patch vulnerable devices, requiring them to disable dynamic peer BOVPNs, add new firewall policies, and disable the default system policies that handle VPN traffic.\n\nOn Saturday, the Internet security watchdog group Shadowserver found over 124,658 unpatched Firebox instances exposed online, with 117,490 still exposed on Sunday.\n\n​One day after WatchGuard released patches, CISA added CVE-2025-14733 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog.\n\nThe U.S. cybersecurity agency also ordered Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies (executive branch non-military agencies, such as the Department of Energy, the Department of the Treasury, and the Department of Homeland Security) to patch Firebox firewalls within a week, by December 26th, as mandated by the Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01.\n\n\"This type of vulnerability is a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and poses significant risks to the federal enterprise,\" CISA warned. \"Apply mitigations per vendor instructions, follow applicable BOD 22-01 guidance for cloud services, or discontinue use of the product if mitigations are unavailable.\"\n\nIn September, WatchGuard patched an almost identical RCE vulnerability (CVE-2025-9242) impacting Firebox firewalls. One month later, Shadowserver found over 75,000 Firebox firewalls vulnerable to CVE-2025-9242 attacks, most in North America and Europe, with CISA later tagging the security flaw as actively exploited in the wild and ordering federal agencies to secure their Firebox appliances from ongoing attacks.\n\nTwo years ago, CISA also ordered U.S. government agencies to patch another actively exploited WatchGuard flaw (CVE-2022-23176) impacting Firebox and XTM firewall appliances.\n\nWatchGuard works with over 17,000 security resellers and service providers to protect the networks of more than 250,000 small and mid-sized companies worldwide.\n\nBroken IAM isn't just an IT problem - the impact ripples across your whole business.\n\nThis practical guide covers why traditional IAM practices fail to keep up with modern demands, examples of what \"good\" IAM looks like, and a simple checklist for building a scalable strategy.",

    "fullText": "THIBODAUX, La. (AP) — The teasing was relentless. Nude images of a 13-year-old girl and her friends, generated by artificial intelligence, were circulating on social media and had become the talk of a Louisiana middle school.\n\nThe girls begged for help, first from a school guidance counselor and then from a sheriff’s deputy assigned to their school. But the images were shared on Snapchat, an app that deletes messages seconds after they’re viewed, and the adults couldn’t find them. The principal had doubts they even existed.\n\nAmong the kids, the pictures were still spreading. When the 13-year-old girl stepped onto the Lafourche Parish school bus at the end of the day, a classmate was showing one of them to a friend.\n\n“That’s when I got angry,” the eighth grader recalled at her discipline hearing.\n\nFed up, she attacked a boy on the bus, inviting others to join her. She was kicked out of Sixth Ward Middle School for more than 10 weeks and sent to an alternative school. She said the boy whom she and her friends suspected of creating the images wasn’t sent to that alternative school with her. The 13-year-old girl’s attorneys allege he avoided school discipline altogether.\n\nWhen the sheriff's department looked into the case, they took the opposite actions. They charged two of the boys who'd been accused of sharing explicit images — and not the girl.\n\nThe Louisiana episode highlights the nightmarish potential of AI deepfakes. They can, and do, upend children's lives — at school, and at home. And while schools are working to address artificial intelligence in classroom instruction, they often have done little to prepare for what the new tech means for cyberbullying and harassment.\n\nOnce again, as kids increasingly use new tech to hurt one another, adults are behind the curve, said Sergio Alexander, a research associate at Texas Christian University focused on emerging technology.\n\n“When we ignore the digital harm, the only moment that becomes visible is when the victim finally breaks,” Alexander said.\n\nIn Lafourche Parish, the school district followed all its protocols for reporting misconduct, Superintendent Jarod Martin said in a statement. He said a “one-sided story” had been presented of the case that fails to illustrate its \"totality and complex nature.”\n\nA girl’s nightmare begins with rumors\n\nAfter hearing rumors about the nude images, the 13-year-old said she marched with two friends — one nearly in tears — to the guidance counselor around 7 a.m. on Aug. 26. The Associated Press isn’t naming her because she is a minor and because AP doesn’t normally name victims of sexual crimes.\n\nShe was there for moral support, not initially realizing there were images of her, too, according to testimony at her school disciplinary hearing.\n\nUltimately, the weeks-long investigation at the school in Thibodaux, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) southwest of New Orleans, uncovered AI-generated nude images of eight female middle school students and two adults, the district and sheriff's office said in a joint statement.\n\n“Full nudes with her face put on them” is how the girl’s father, Joseph Daniels, described them.\n\nUntil recently, it took some technical skill to make realistic deepfakes. Technology now makes it easy to pluck a photo off social media, “nudify” it and create a viral nightmare for an unsuspecting classmate.\n\nMost schools are “just kind of burying their heads in the sand, hoping that this isn’t happening,” said Sameer Hinduja, co-director of the Cyberbullying Research Center and professor of criminology at Florida Atlantic University.\n\nLafourche Parish School District was just starting to develop policies on artificial intelligence. The school-level AI guidance mainly addressed academics, according to documents provided through a records request. The district also hadn’t updated its training on cyberbullying to reflect the threat of AI-generated, sexually explicit images. The curriculum its schools used was from 2018.\n\nA school investigation hits obstacles\n\nAlthough the girls at Sixth Ward Middle School hadn’t seen the images firsthand, they heard about them from boys at school. Based on those conversations, the girls accused a classmate and two students from other schools of creating and spreading the nudes on Snapchat and possibly TikTok.\n\nThe principal, Danielle Coriell, said an investigation came up cold that day as no student took responsibility. The deputy assigned to the school searched social media for the images unsuccessfully, according to a recording of the disciplinary hearing.\n\n“I was led to believe that this was just hearsay and rumors,” the girl’s father said, recounting a conversation he had that morning with the school counselor.\n\nBut the girl was miserable, and a police incident report showed more girls were reporting that they were victims, too. The 13-year-old returned to the counselor in the afternoon, asking to call her father. She said she was refused.\n\nHer father says she sent a text message that said, “Dad,” and nothing else. They didn't talk. With the mocking unrelenting, the girl texted her sister, “It’s not getting handled.”\n\nAs the school day wound down, the principal was skeptical. At the disciplinary hearing, the girl’s attorney asked why the sheriff's deputy didn’t check the phone of the boy the girls were accusing and why he was allowed on the same bus as the girl.\n\n“Kids lie a lot,” responded Coriell, the principal. “They lie about all kinds of things. They blow lots of things out of proportion on a daily basis. In 17 years, they do it all the time. So to my knowledge, at 2 o’clock when I checked again, there were no pictures.”\n\nA fight breaks out on the school bus\n\nWhen the girl stepped onto the bus 15 minutes later, the boy was showing the AI-generated images to a friend. Fake nude images of her friends were visible on the boy’s phone, the girl said, a claim backed up by a photo taken on the bus. A video from the school bus showed at least a half-dozen students circulating the images, said Martin, the superintendent, at a school board meeting.\n\n“I went the whole day with getting bullied and getting made fun of about my body,” the girl said at her hearing. When she boarded the bus, she said, anger was building up.\n\nAfter seeing the boy and his phone, she slapped him, said Coriell, the principal. The boy shrugged off the slap, a video shows.\n\nShe hit him a second time. Then, the principal said, the girl asked aloud: “Why am I the only one doing this?” Two classmates hit the boy, the principal said, before the 13-year-old climbed over a seat and punched and stomped on him.\n\nVideo of the fight was posted on Facebook. “Overwhelming social media sentiment was one of outrage and a demand that the students involved in the fight be held accountable,” the district and sheriff’s office said in their joint statement released in November.\n\nThe girl had no past disciplinary problems, but she was assigned to an alternative school as the district moved to expel her for a full semester — 89 school days.\n\nIt was on the day of the girl’s disciplinary hearing, three weeks after the fight, that the first of the boys was charged.\n\nThe student was charged with 10 counts of unlawful dissemination of images created by artificial intelligence under a new Louisiana state law, part of a wave of such legislation around the country. A second boy was charged in December with identical charges, the sheriff's department said. Neither was identified by authorities because of their ages.\n\nThe girl would face no charges because of what the sheriff’s office described as the “totality of the circumstances.”\n\nAt the disciplinary hearing, the principal refused to answer questions from the girl’s attorneys about what kind of school discipline the boy would face.\n\nThe district said in a statement that federal student privacy laws prohibit it from discussing individual students’ disciplinary records. Gregory Miller, an attorney for the girl, said he has no knowledge of any school discipline for the classmate accused of sharing the images.\n\nUltimately, the panel expelled the 13-year-old. She wept, her father said.\n\n“She just felt like she was victimized multiple times — by the pictures and by the school not believing her and by them putting her on a bus and then expelling her for her actions,” he said in an interview.\n\nThe fallout sends a student off course\n\nAfter she was sent to the alternative school, the girl started skipping meals, her father said. Unable to concentrate, she completed none of the school's online work for several days before her father got her into therapy for depression and anxiety.\n\nNobody initially noticed when she stopped doing her assignments, her father said.\n\n“She kind of got left behind,” he said.\n\nHer attorneys appealed to the school board, and another hearing was scheduled for seven weeks later.\n\nFor students who are suspended or expelled, the impact can last years. They're more likely to be suspended again. They become disconnected from their classmates, and they’re more likely to become disengaged from school. They're more likely to have lower grades and lower graduation rates.\n\n“She’s already been out of school enough,” one of the girl's attorneys, Matt Ory, told the board on Nov. 5. “She is a victim.\n\n“She,” he repeated, “is a victim.”\n\nMartin, the superintendent, countered: “Sometimes in life we can be both victims and perpetrators.”\n\nBut the board was swayed. One member, Henry Lafont, said: “There are a lot of things in that video that I don’t like. But I’m also trying to put into perspective what she went through all day.” They allowed her to return to campus immediately. Her first day back at school was Nov. 7, although she will remain on probation until Jan. 29.\n\nThat means no dances, no sports and no extracurricular activities. She already missed out on basketball tryouts, meaning she won’t be able to play this season, her father said. He finds the situation “heartbreaking.”\n\n“I was hoping she would make great friends, they would go to the high school together and, you know, it’d keep everybody out of trouble on the right tracks,” her father said. “I think they ruined that.”\n\nThe Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

    "description": "German car exports to the United States slumped by almost 14% in the first three quarters of 2025, making it the hardest-hit branch of German industry in U.S.",
    "fullText": "BERLIN, Dec 22 (Reuters) - German car exports to the United States slumped by almost 14% in the first three ​quarters of 2025, making it the hardest-hit branch of German ‌industry in U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war, according to a study seen ‌by Reuters on Monday.\n\nUnder an agreement between Washington and Brussels, the U.S. set a 15% baseline tariff on cars from Europe from August 1 - significantly less than Trump's initial rate of 25% on top of ⁠a 2.5% existing levy.\n\nGerman ‌engineering companies have also struggled under the tariff regime, with the study showing exports in that sector ‍to the U.S. declining by 9.5% in the first nine months of 2025.\n\nMachinery exports are subject to a 50% U.S. tariff on steel and aluminium ​products.\n\nThe chemical industry also saw exports to the country's top export ‌market decline by 9.5%, although the report said this could not be blamed solely on tariffs.\n\n\"Other factors are likely to have played a role in the case of chemical products, such as lower production in Germany due to higher energy prices,\" it said.\n\nAcross all ⁠sectors, German exports to the U.S. ​were down 7.8% year on year over ​the three quarters - following average growth of nearly 5% in the comparable periods of 2016 to 2024.\n\n\"Since it ‍must currently be ⁠assumed that U.S. import tariffs will not return to pre-Trump administration levels in the foreseeable future, a significant recovery in German ⁠exports to the U.S. is unlikely,\" study author Samina Sultan said, referring to ‌a \"new normal\" for German exporters.",

    "title": "Why The B-52 Bomber Uses Eight Engines Instead Of Four",
    "description": "Most modern aircraft use four jet engines, but the B-52 bomber has eight. The reasons start in one frantic weekend its designers spent in the 1940s.",
    "fullText": "The B-52 Stratofortress carries eight engines for one simple reason: the technology of the 1940s, when it was designed, wasn't capable of powering it with anything less. Engineers didn't have much choice but to group eight of these early Pratt & Whitney J57s together in the plane's signature twin-pod configuration to achieve the massive thrust necessary to hoist a fully loaded bomber up to the high altitudes needed.\n\nWith modern technology, if the same plane were designed from scratch, it would require no more than four engines, much like what we see in the C-17 Globemaster or the B-1 Lancer or even the twin-engine design of America's next stealth bomber, the B-21. However, the B-52 is a relic of an earlier technological era.\n\nThis defining silhouette was not part of some sort of long-term master plan, but rather the result of a frantic weekend redesign spurred by a crisis in a Dayton, Ohio hotel room. Boeing's first conceptions, the Models 462 and 464, used huge Wright XT-35 turboprops rather than pure jets. The gas turbines were highly complex, though, and engineers were convinced that their propellers would lose efficiency at high speeds. Things came to a head in October, 1948 when Col. Henry \"Pete\" Warden of the Air Materiel Command urged Boeing engineers to once and for all drop the failing turboprop configuration. The team reworked the airframe over that single weekend, returning with Model 464-49, which finally paired the swept-wing design with the eight-engine turbojet layout we see today.\n\nThe Air Force has tried several times over the years to re-engine the B-52 with four high-bypass turbofans, similar to what one would find on commercial airliners. Proposals in 1969, 1980, and even a joint Boeing and Rolls-Royce pitch in 1996 aimed at the modernization of the bomber with drastically fewer engines. These proposals were continuously turned down because the switch would drive a snowball of engineering problems that outweigh any potential benefits.\n\nThere's the B-52's existing airframe, specifically the shorter tail fins and rudders on today's G and H models, which just can't handle the physics of a four-engine setup. The four-engine arrangement could create dangerous asymmetric thrust if one of four large engines were to flame out — the resultant yaw or twist could violently pull the nose toward the dead engine and make it impossible for a pilot to control the plane. The pilot would have to stomp on the rudder to keep the plane flying straight, but the current rudder doesn't have the surface area to fight that kind of drag.\n\nSo the plane would have to have major redesigns in the wings, cockpit, and engine struts, owing to different weight distribution and drag profiles. It would open a Pandora's box of structural risks and delays that the Air Force just isn't willing to touch.\n\nThis commitment to the legacy eight-engine configuration birthed the massive Commercial Engine Replacement Program, which will keep the B-52 flying alongside the next-generation B-21 Raider into the 2050s. In 2021, Rolls-Royce secured a $2.6-billion contract to replace the aged-out Pratt & Whitney TF33 engines with 650 F130 engines, a militarized BR725, on a one-for-one basis, preserving the eight-engine layout.\n\nThat replacement is not to boost the airplane's speed but to provide 30% better fuel efficiency and considerably cut maintenance needs. And the engineers aren't just guessing whether all of it will fit in. Boeing and Rolls-Royce are using \"digital twins\" — exact 3D models of the aircraft — to identify problems such as mismatched hydraulic lines or electrical disconnects before they ever touch a real plane.\n\nThe Boeing B-52 still retains its eight engines because replacing them would amount to breaking the very advantages that have kept it flying. By upgrading the propulsion system without changing its basic airframe architecture, the Air Force has made a wise decision that will help in keeping its oldest jet in the skies until it's 100 years old.\n\nWant more like this?

    "fullText": "TOKYO (AP) — Japan's space agency said its H3 rocket carrying a navigation satellite failed to put the payload into a planned orbit, a setback for the country's new flagship rocket and its space launch program.\n\nMonday's failure is the second for Japan's new flagship rocket after its botched 2023 debut flight and six successful flights.\n\nThe Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency said the H3 rocket carrying the Michibiki 5 satellite took off from the Tanegashima Space Center on a southwestern Japanese island Monday as part of Japan's plans to have a more precise location positioning system of its own.\n\nThe rocket's second-stage engine burn unexpectedly had a premature cutoff and a subsequent separation of the satellite from the rocket could not be confirmed, Masashi Okada, a JAXA executive and launch director, told a news conference.\n\nWhether the satellite was released into space or where it ended up is unknown, and that JAXA is investigating the data to determine the cause and other details, Okada said.\n\nJun Kondo, an official at the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, told reporters that the failure was “extremely regrettable” and that the government set up a task force to investigate the cause and take necessary measures as soon as possible to “regain credibility.”\n\nMonday's failure is a setback for Japan's new flagship that replaced the earlier mainstay H-2A which had near-perfect success record. It also delays Japan’s satellite launch plans, including one to have a more independent geolocation system for smartphones, maritime navigation and drones without relying on the U.S. GPS system.\n\nThe H3 rocket is designed to be more cost-competitive in the global space market. Japan sees a stable, commercially competitive space transport capability as key to its space program and national security.\n\nJAXA's H3 project manager, Makoto Arita, said the new flagship is still in the early stages of operation but can be globally competitive. “We will pull ourselves together so that we won't fall behind rivals. We'll fully investigate the cause and put H3 back on track.”\n\nMonday's launch came five days after JAXA aborted just 17 seconds before liftoff, citing an abnormality of a water spray system at the launch facility, following an earlier problem with the rocket.\n\nIn its debut flight in March 2023, H3 failed to ignite the second-stage engine.\n\nJapan currently has the quasi-zenith satellite system, or QZSS, with five satellites for a regional navigation system that first went into operation in 2018. The Michibiki 5 was to be the sixth of its network.\n\nJapan currently relies partially on American GPS and wants to have a seven-satellite network system by March 2026 and an 11-satellite network by the late 2030s.",

    "fullText": "The artificial intelligence boom is real — but there's more to the AI trade than chips alone, according to a credit investor.\n\n\"This is a super-duper micro cycle that will outlast many investing careers,\" said Scott Goodwin, the cofounder and managing partner of Diameter Capital Partners, a quote he attributed to his partner Jonathan Lewinsohn.\n\nAI represents what Diameter Capital sees as a long-running, disruptive cycle — but buying the most obvious winners isn't the only way to play it, he said on the \"Goldman Sachs Exchanges\" podcast published on Friday.\n\nDiameter Capital, which manages approximately $25 billion in assets, has focused on where AI demand could create less obvious bottlenecks — and where those bottlenecks show up in credit markets.\n\nThat view led Diameter to buy the unsecured debt of a midsize telecommunications company in 2023.\n\nGoodwin said the bet was rooted in the idea that as companies move from training AI models to actually using them, demand shifts away from chips alone and toward the networks that carry data.\n\n\"It had to leave the data center. How would it leave? It would leave on the commercial fiber, the pipes,\" he said.\n\nThe telco went on to sign more than $10 billion in contracts with hyperscale cloud providers, and the debt has rebounded to face value, Goodwin said.\n\nDiameter Capital also made \"a big bet\" on a satellite company tied to the wireless spectrum — a wager that later paid off after the company sold spectrum assets and the debt returned to face value.\n\nGoodwin's comments come amid growing debate over whether sky-high AI valuations are sustainable and whether investors are overlooking other opportunities tied to the technology.\n\nGoodwin warned that parts of the AI-credit boom may be taking on risk that's hard to price, especially in chip finance.\n\nSome investors, he said, are taking on \"residual risk,\" or the riskiest slice of chip-financing deals — betting on what the hardware might be worth years from now. Cutting-edge firms refresh their technology often, so chips can quickly become outdated for some customers.\n\n\"We call up really smart people in Silicon Valley, we call up really smart people at Big Tech companies and ask them what the residual value is on these chips three, four, five, six, seven years forward,\" he said. \"None of them have a clue.\"\n\nGoodwin said the next phase isn't just about spending on infrastructure — it's about competitive disruption rather than capital expenditure.\n\n\"Who are the companies, who are the entities that are going to adopt AI and take a step forward versus their peers? And who are going to be the losers?\" he asked.\n\n\"That is actually a longer cycle than the capex cycle, so that's really interesting,\" he said.",

This season the Rossoneri have lost only once in the league.\n\nIt is a stark difference from last season, when they lost 11 matches and finished eight - their worst league finish in a decade.\n\n\"We all came back in the summer with a point to prove, individually and collectively. We have to attack the season and get back in the Champions League,\" says Tomori, who turned 28 last week.\n\nUnder Allegri, playing in a three-man defence has allowed the centre-half to thrive.\n\n\"Physically it's the best I've felt,\" Tomori says. \"Part of that is knowing where I have to be on the pitch. It's helped me a lot when it comes to reading the game.\n\n\"It's a simple thing, but there's no need to over-extend yourself as a defender. It's about running smarter, not harder.\"\n\nIt is nearly six years since Tomori, who grew up supporting Arsenal, made the leap and left Chelsea, where he came through the ranks. \"I wanted to stabilise my career,\" he says.\n\nTomori has made 194 appearances for Milan since and by now is fluent in Italian and completely immersed in the culture.\n\n\"The accent comes naturally too,\" he says. \"If I don't speak in the accent or switch it on, they won't understand.\n\n\"It's a different way of life, but the biggest difference is how we train. In Italy it's a lot more focus-based in terms of how we'll play, whereas in England training can be more physical and intense.\n\n\"When I was growing up there was a stereotype that English players didn't go abroad, but there's quite a few now, which shows we can go abroad and adapt to a different way of living too.\"",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens' playoff hopes continued to hang in the air entering Week 16.\n\nWith a matchup against the 11-3 New England Patriots on Sunday night, the Ravens certainly weren't given an easy path to maintain their playoff hopes — so when Lamar Jackson exited the prime-time game in the second quarter, it was yet another cause of concern for Baltimore.\n\nJackson, who has had a down year as he's dealt with nagging injuries, was replaced by Tyler Huntley. Baltimore went on to lose 28-24, as Jackson did not return.\n\nHere's the latest on the Ravens' star quarterback's status.\n\nPatriots clinch playoff spot for first time since 2021\n\nHow Patriots wound up benefitting from missed DPI call on Marlon Humphrey\n\nRavens' path to the postseason gets bleaker with loss to Patriots\n\nJackson is dealing with a “bruise of some kind,\" head coach John Harbaugh said, and the Ravens are currently unsure of his status moving forward. Per Jeff Zrebiec, Harbaugh said he has no sense of how much time Jackson could miss with the injury, if any.\n\nJackson was been ruled out for the remainder of Sunday night's game with a back injury after initially being questionable. Tyler Huntley played the entire second half in his absence.\n\nRavens QB Lamar Jackson (back) has been ruled out for the rest of the game\n\n— Jamison Hensley (@jamisonhensley) December 22, 2025\n\nJackson appeared to take a knee to his back/rib area on a run against the Patriots in the second quarter. Soon after that play, the Ravens took a timeout, and Jackson exited for the sideline as he was replaced under center by Huntley.\n\nNow an injury for the #Ravens: Lamar Jackson is going to the locker room.\n\nTyler Huntley is in the game. Will have more updates when available.\n\nThis is what the broadcast showed: pic.twitter.com/oeSRGdLFQ4\n\n— Arye Pulli (@AryePulliNFL) December 22, 2025\n\nJackson was seen visibly frustrated when walking back to the locker room.\n\nThis was Lamar Jackson’s reaction as he went with #Ravens trainers to locker room before halftime #RavensFlockpic.twitter.com/ASrNwsT6FF\n\n— Jerry Coleman (@sportswcoleman) December 22, 2025\n\nOn the NBC broadcast, Jackson was said to have struggled going down the stairs and up the stairs to get into the locker room. His absence came right before halftime, allowing the Ravens some time to check on the quarterback and determine his status for the second half.\n\nHowever, Jackson remained sidelined when the Ravens offense took the field in the third quarter, and he never came back on the field as his team fell to 7-8 this season.\n\nPostgame, Huntley told reporters that Jackson was \"bummed\" about his injury and he could \"barely move.\"\n\nTyler Huntley on Lamar Jackson’s mood after being hurt: “He was bummed. He could barely move.” pic.twitter.com/pWGnTO1gfy\n\n— Jamison Hensley (@jamisonhensley) December 22, 2025\n\nHow Travis Kelce's retirement decision is easy with no Patrick Mahomes\n\nPanthers take control of NFC South with massive win over Buccaneers\n\nMyles Garrett inches closer to NFL sack record with obscure half sack\n\nGardner Minshew suffers potential ACL tear in first Chiefs game without Patrick Mahomes\n\nQuinshon Judkins out for season after gruesome leg injury vs. Bills\n\nJackson took a knee to his rib/back area in the second quarter against the Patriots on Sunday night. He was pulled from the game soon afterward, going to the locker room with what the team called a back injury.\n\nThe Ravens initially ruled him questionable to return, needing a win in the matchup to compete at the top of the AFC North. He didn't return to the game and was ruled out in the third quarter. John Harbaugh said postgame that Jackson was dealing with a \"bruise of some kind.\"\n\nHuntley, in his second career stint with the Ravens, is the team's backup quarterback. He entered for Jackson on Sunday night, taking over the offense. Coming into Week 16, Huntley had already made one start for Baltimore this season, going for 186 passing yards and a touchdown pass against the Bears.\n\nIn his career, Huntley has 3,040 passing yards and 733 rushing yards, at least somewhat of a dual-threat option for Baltimore behind Jackson.\n\nCooper Rush, the former Dallas Cowboys backup, is the QB3 in Baltimore, and the backup to Huntley if Jackson is out. Rush was designated as the team's emergency third quarterback in Week 16.",

He started the year on the PUP list after having his 2024 campaign cut short by a significant knee injury that included a torn ACL, and it makes sense for a rebuilding Saints team to move in another direction.\n\n“I can tell you, I have so much love for the city of New Orleans and this fan base and the way that they’ve embraced me and my family,” Hill said.\n\n“It’s been really special. I wouldn’t want to play somewhere else, but there’s a lot of circumstances that are out of your control and I understand the nature of this business. I’m not thinking that way right now, but we’ll tackle that when we get there.”\n\n“This league talks about trying to find ‘Taysom Hills,’ but no one can duplicate it.”\n\nNew Orleans Saints coach Kellen Moore\n\nNew Orleans first-year coach Kellen Moore, who is Hill’s third head coach in his time with the Saints, shared what Hill has meant to the franchise.\n\n“This league talks about trying to find ‘Taysom Hills,’ but no one can duplicate it,” Moore said. “His ability to play every phase of the offense and contribute on special teams is really special.\n\n“He’s an A-plus person, an A-plus human being and an A-plus player.

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots had their backs against the wall in Sunday's game against the Baltimore Ravens. But there was no stopping quarterback Drake Maye and Mike Vrabel's Patriots under the primetime lights of Sunday Night Football.\n\nThe Patriots rallied from an 11-point deficit in the fourth quarter to knock off a desperate Ravens team on the road at M&T Bank Stadium in a 28-24 win.\n\nIt was an ugly game out of the gates with Maye committing two turnovers—an interception on the Patriots' first offensive drive and a fumble before halftime. The team also got smacked hard with the injury bug, with multiple key players going down, including rookie running back TreVeyon Henderson, who left with a head injury and never returned.\n\nBut the Patriots can't use the injury excuse in a game where Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson missed the entire second half due to a back injury. Ravens backup Tyler Huntley stepped up and filled in well enough to nearly hold off the Patriots.\n\nAnd then Maye burned the Ravens' defense over the top with a ridiculous 37-yard touchdown pass to rookie wide receiver Kyle Williams.\n\nOMG THIS IS BEAUTIFUL 😍\n\n.@DrakeMaye2 | @k_mmoneyyyy \n\n📺 NBC pic.twitter.com/qQpgUkN76K\n\n— New England Patriots (@Patriots) December 22, 2025\n\nThis game was the complete opposite of last week's loss to the Buffalo Bills with the Patriots starting slow and finishing strong against the Ravens.\n\nOn the ensuing offensive series, Maye led the Patriots down the field on a drive that was capped off by a 21-yard touchdown run by running back Rhamondre Stevenson to put New England ahead. It was a clutch drive that overcame one of the worst pass interference no-calls you will ever see.\n\nkayshon boutte; pass interference; patriots vs ravens pic.twitter.com/jiJUbu6Ns8\n\n— ◇ (@F0RGIAT0) December 22, 2025\n\nThe Patriots didn't play their best game, but it was still enough to get a win over a Huntley-led Ravens team on the road. Maye also showed the ability to put the team on his back and carry them across the finish line when the chips are down.\n\nAnd they were plenty down before the fourth quarter comeback on Sunday.\n\nMaye eclipsed 300 yards passing for the first time this season, finishing 31-of-44 for 380 passing yards and two touchdowns. It's another strong performance for the second-year quarterback to hang his helmet on.\n\nWith the win, the Patriots have now clinched a spot in the playoffs. They are also still in the race for the No. 1 seed in the AFC if they win out and the Denver Broncos lose another game. A road trip to MetLife Stadium to take on the New York Jets is next on the itinerary.\n\nFollow Patriots Wire on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Patriots Wire: Instant analysis of Patriots' comeback win to stun Ravens on the road",

Injuries have been a theme for each; for San Francisco, virtually every big name on its veteran roster has missed some kind of time in 2025.\n\nIt's Indianapolis' quarterback situation that will be in the spotlight though, as the 44-year-old Philip Rivers trots back out for his second start after making a shocking return to the NFL in Week 15 as a fill-in starter after Daniel Jones' injury.\n\nAfter nearly taking down the Seahawks last week, Rivers will be seeking his first win in five years against the 49ers. Meanwhile, Kyle Shanahan's unit will be eyeing a win to come closer to locking in a playoff spot.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about watching Monday Night Football, including TV and streaming information for 49ers vs. Colts.\n\nLocation: Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana\n\nThe Colts host the 49ers on Monday Night Football in Week 16, with the game set to be played at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana.\n\nKickoff for Monday Night Football is scheduled for 8:15 p.m. ET on Monday, Dec. 22.\n\nMonday Night Football will be simulcast live on both ABC and ESPN with Joe Buck (play-by-play) in the booth alongside Troy Aikman (analyst).\n\nThe game will stream live on Fubo, which offers a free trial, as well as via the brand-new ESPN app.\n\nNow you can watch ESPN without cable.

    "fullText": "Over the last few days, the Los Angeles Lakers have suddenly become very short-handed. First, they lost Austin Reaves to a calf strain he suffered just over a week ago, and then starting center Deandre Ayton came down with elbow soreness and missed their last two games.\n\nThen, against the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday, they didn't have starting forward Rui Hachimura, who is dealing with a groin ailment. To make matters worse, Luka Doncic sustained a leg contusion during that game and was ruled out for the second half. Without so many key players, the Lakers had a huge lack of offensive firepower and lost 103-88 to the Clippers.\n\nHead coach JJ Redick said that he hopes Hachimura will be back after missing a total of only a few days.\n\nJJ Redick says Rui Hachimura, out tonight with a sore groin, started to feel discomfort in his hip in the UTA game. Redick says “the hope” is Hachimura is only out for 3-5 days\n\n— Dave McMenamin (@mcten) December 21, 2025\n\nHe also added that Ayton and Reaves are improving, although he didn't say whether either of them will play in the team's next game on Tuesday versus the Phoenix Suns.\n\nRedick added that Deandre Ayton (left elbow) and Austin Reaves (left calf) are both progressing and did not rule out either of them playing in PHX on Tuesday https://t.co/GeFicCsrlL\n\n— Dave McMenamin (@mcten) December 21, 2025\n\nThe Lakers have a marquee matchup coming up on Christmas Day versus Kevin Durant and the Houston Rockets, who are 17-8 and right behind the Lakers in fifth place in the Western Conference. Five days later, the Purple and Gold will host the Detroit Pistons, who have the Eastern Conference's best record at 22-6.\n\nNeedless to say, they will need to be somewhere close to full strength in order to defeat either team, let alone both of them.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: JJ Redick gives updates on Rui Hachimura, Austin Reaves, Deandre Ayton",

They'll need to find someone else to make an impact in the passing game alongside George Kittle, Christian McCaffrey and Jauan Jennings.\n\nThe Colts are going the opposite direction, losing their last four games after starting the year with an 8-2 record. With Daniel Jones and Anthony Richardson on injured reserve, they'll give 44-year-old Philip Rivers his second start of the year.\n\nBefore these two teams meet on the field on Sunday, we've gone through picks from roughly 40 experts from different sites/publications to see who they're taking in this matchup.

    "fullText": "Underneath the black stairs at OGC Nice Football Club’s training ground, a colourful photo wall illustrates INEOS’ sporting ventures.\n\nThe men’s teams of Manchester United, Ligue 1 side Nice and Swiss outfit Lausanne-Sport are pictured celebrating, and an INEOS Grenadiers cyclist speeds past. INEOS Britannia, the boat for the America’s Cup, stands majestically. Eliud Kipchoge, sporting a white INEOS shirt, smiles as he becomes the first person to run a marathon in less than two hours, and Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One drivers George Russell and Kimi Antonelli walk side by side. Seven-time F1 world champion Lewis Hamilton, then also with Mercedes, perches atop an INEOS Grenadiers vehicle alongside Sir Jim Ratcliffe.\n\nBetween Ratcliffe and INEOS — the petrochemicals company he founded, co-owns and chairs — more than £2.5billion ($3.3bn) has been invested in the past eight years across sports including football, cycling, sailing and running, according to publicly available information.\n\nYet the interest in women’s sports seems practically non-existent.\n\nIn cycling, INEOS took control of Team Sky in April 2019 — now competing as INEOS Grenadiers — and was urged to start a women’s team by many, including the former head of the UCI, cycling’s world governing body, Brian Cookson. It never happened.\n\n“It’s a surefire miss,” one former professional cyclist tells The Athletic. “I’m baffled as to why Ratcliffe hasn’t done it.”\n\nIn F1, INEOS is a partner and one-third owner of Mercedes-AMG Petronas, which has a French driver, 21-year-old Doriane Pin, in the sport’s all-women F1 Academy series.\n\nRatcliffe has also backed women in leadership positions across the business side of INEOS.\n\nLynn Calder is chief executive of INEOS automotive, makers of the Grenadier 4×4, and Florence Bardot and Natalina Arena hold senior finance roles in the petrochemicals field. Fran Millar was made CEO of Team Sky, INEOS Grenadiers and INEOS’ former fashion business Belstaff, since bought by sportswear group Castore in August but in which INEOS retains an interest through a strategic investment agreed as part of that sale. Her successor was Kerry Byrne. But there are currently no female CEOs across INEOS’ sports interests.\n\nIn sailing, Ratcliffe’s daughters, Julia Ratcliffe and Romane Polli, were named godmothers of INEOS’ boat, Britannia, competing at the America’s Cup off Barcelona, Spain, last year and christened the boat by spraying Nyetimber English sparkling wine on the bow for good luck. INEOS, however, was not the title sponsor for last year’s women’s America’s Cup, the first of its kind.\n\nAfter INEOS bought a minority stake in Manchester United in 2024, Ratcliffe has always been forthright about where the women’s team lie among his priorities. “The men’s team make £800million, the women’s team cost £10m,” he told The Sunday Times in August 2024.\n\nRatcliffe has repeatedly said his focus has been on United’s men’s team because that is “what moves the needle”, as he told BBC Sport in March. “Of our £650million of income, £640m of that comes from the men’s team and £10m comes from the women’s team,” he added.\n\nUnited’s 2023-24 accounts show the club lost £130.7million ($174m at current rates) and the women’s team contributed £100,000 to that loss, around 0.08 per cent.\n\nRevenues in women’s elite sports, according to finance experts Deloitte, are predicted to have risen by 240 per cent from 2022 to 2025. The same firm forecasts global revenues to reach at least $2.35billion (£1.75bn) in 2025. The two highest revenue-generating sports are basketball and football/soccer, and, while this predicted growth does not extend to all disciplines, Deloitte has stated “the growth of women’s sport has continued to exceed expectations”.\n\nSo is INEOS’ apparent lack of interest in women’s sport purely commercially driven? On the INEOS ‘compass’, which the company states was devised by Ratcliffe “as a fun way of attempting to capture how INEOS works”, “kids and sport”, “fitness and health” and “do the right thing” are all in the “things we like” section.\n\nAnd when it launched its support for Kipchoge’s sub-two-hour marathon attempt in May 2019, Ratcliffe said: “We make six or seven billion dollars a year in profit, so what’s wrong with investing a bit of that in sport? On some good challenges, good people, try to inspire people? It’s good fun.”\n\nKipchoge, a member of the NN running team, which had a performance partnership with INEOS until it ended last week, was the athlete in the world most likely to stand any chance of running the marathon’s 26.2 miles in less than two hours. It is understandable INEOS backed a man in its pursuit of smashing such a significant human barrier.\n\nHowever, when three-time Olympic and five-time world champion Faith Kipyegon, who has the same coach as Kipchoge and is also a NN athlete, attempted in June this year to be the first woman to run a mile in under four minutes — a Nike-backed project called Breaking4 — INEOS was not publicly involved. Kipyegon missed the mark by 6.42 seconds.\n\nAs INEOS closes in on the two-year anniversary of its investment in United, The Athletic has spoken to people familiar with its sporting endeavours, many of whom will remain anonymous to protect relationships, about the firm’s approach to women’s sport and women athletes.\n\n“INEOS missed the boat,” is a phrase repeated by many.\n\nAn INEOS spokesperson said: “We are totally committed to supporting our female teams and athletes across all of our sports activities. This is most apparent in football, but also in our support for female cyclists and runners.”\n\nTeam Sky’s Bradley Wiggins, Chris Froome and Geraint Thomas dominated the Tour de France during the mid-2010s.\n\nWhen INEOS took over Team Sky in 2019, it inherited an imperious operation led by Sir Dave Brailsford, who left British Cycling in 2014 after overseeing unprecedented success for men and women at World Championship and Olympic level. It also inherited a team facing questions about whether it had crossed the line in its dominance on the road.\n\nIn 2017, an independent review of British Cycling’s culture from 2012-16 was published, reporting that the “environment was one which some female riders… found uncomfortable” and there were “failings in British Cycling’s governance and leadership”. In February of that year, ahead of the review, Brailsford wrote in The Times that the team was “medallist, not sexist”.\n\nMillar told magazine Rouleur in 2021 that, after the 2012 Olympics in London, she and rider Lizzie Deignan (then Armitstead) raised the prospect of starting a women’s team “at every board meeting” for Team Sky. Some argued a women’s team was not warranted, given the struggling financial landscape of women’s cycling but by the late 2010s and early 2020s, several major men’s teams such as Visma-Lease a Bike, Lidl-Trek and Movistar, which still exist today, had launched women’s teams. Paris-Roubaix started a women’s race in 2021, won by Deignan riding for Trek-Segafredo, and the Tour de France Femmes was revived in 2022.\n\nHowever, INEOS, Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe, Team Bahrain Victorious, Decathlon–AG2R La Mondiale and XDS-Astana still have only men’s outfits.\n\nIn 2018, Natascha Knaven-den Ouden and her husband Servais Knaven, Team Sky’s sports director, set up APB, an under-19 women’s development team with six riders. Along with a French junior men’s team, APB’s women cycled with Team Sky’s pro riders on part of the cobbled Paris-Roubaix course ahead of the main event — for men only — in 2018.\n\nIn a Team Sky video from the time, Brailsford says: “When you’re a team like Team Sky at the highest level, what can you do for younger riders in the sport? Try to inspire. It’s something they and we’ll remember, something for the sport; just enjoyable. Without the fundamentals, the clubs, the youngsters in the sport, we have nothing.”\n\nAt the 2018 Belgian Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, Knaven-den Ouden recalls Team Sky allowing APB riders to see first-hand how a team operates from the inside. They stayed, she says, in the same hotel as Team Sky, had dinner with the men’s riders and staff and were part of the support team on race day, holding wheels and water bottles on the side of the road. And from then until the end of 2020, Team Sky and then INEOS gave APB riders equipment, such as wheels, chains, bike bags and cool boxes.\n\nKnaven-den Ouden then set up an under-23 women’s team, which became a UCI continental team called NXTG Racing. In February 2021, NXTG CEO Marion de Cocq says she sent a proposal via email to INEOS. The vision was to set up a continental team, using NXTG Racing’s under-23s as a feeder, which would cost an estimated €1.5million for the first year — about three per cent of the INEOS men’s team’s €45m (£39.4m/$52.7m at the current rates) budget.\n\n“We need partners who think outside of the box, who want to innovate and pioneer,” it read, according to two people who have seen the email. “Together with INEOS, we can create history in cycling.”\n\nKnaven-den Ouden and De Cocq say they never received a reply. INEOS declined to comment.\n\nThere were other opportunities to invest in women’s cycling, however.\n\nIn November 2022, INEOS signed France’s reigning mountain bike and gravel world champion Pauline Ferrand-Prevot on a two-year contract. She had gold at the 2024 Paris Olympics in her sights, which she duly won, but INEOS did not build a team around Ferrand-Prevot, who then returned to road racing, signed for Visma-Lease A Bike and won the 2025 Tour de France Femmes.\n\n“They’ve given so many young British men a start in the sport at that level,” says the same former professional cyclist quoted earlier in this article. “They really have the opportunity to lift up women’s cycling in Britain in the same way. They signed quality male cyclists, but are only going to sign the top woman ever.”\n\nINEOS has two women among 65 staff members on the racing side, and 12 of 85 overall when including administrative personnel. Visma-Lease A Bike, Ferrand-Prevot’s new team, has 29 female staff overall.\n\nThe same former professional cyclist described INEOS as a “men’s’ club” with an “old-school, blokey mentality” that is “palpable” around the cycling paddock. “It wouldn’t be a welcoming place for a female team unless they have the staff dedicated to making a concerted shift in the culture,” was the person’s verdict.\n\nThe America’s Cup is the oldest international sports competition, and one the British entrant has not won since 1851.\n\nRatcliffe, though, loves a challenge and invested in INEOS’ Britannia’s campaigns in the 36th and 37th America’s Cups in 2021 and 2024, led by team principal and skipper Sir Ben Ainslie. Its financial accounts detail a total of £226.5million of sponsorship income from 2019 to 2024, though there were other sponsorship sources besides INEOS.\n\nIn order to compete in the 2024 America’s Cup, each team had to supply a women’s and youth team for their respective regattas.\n\nBritain entered under the name Athena Pathway, part of Ainslie’s Athena Sports Group, which was set up in 2022 by the world’s most successful Olympic sailors, Ainslie and Hannah Mills. The programme gives women and younger sailors, male and female, more opportunities in high-performance sailing and tries to increase diversity in the sport.\n\nThe women’s edition was the first in history but Athena Pathway had no involvement with or sponsorship from INEOS. Instead, it was sponsored by Cobham-Ultra, an innovator in aerospace and maritime technology. By contrast, Italy, France, Switzerland, New Zealand and the United States all sponsored their men’s, women’s and youth teams in their respective regattas.\n\nINEOS’ website proudly details how INEOS Britannia “made history as the first British team in 60 years to reach the Cup Match, the first in 90 years to score points, and the first ever to win the Challenger Series — marking Britain’s most successful campaign”. Athena Pathway women’s team, led by Mills, also made history by advancing to the final, narrowly finishing second in a single match-race shootout, while the youth team finished third.\n\nIn April this year, INEOS Britannia withdrew its challenge for the next America’s Cup in 2027, saying its decision was due to “protracted negotiations” with Athena Racing.\n\nSpeaking to The Athletic in April, Ainslie said: “We competed under Athena Pathway and part of the Athena Sports Group. We had some other sponsors, that were fantastic, who came in to back them (the women’s team). It’s not for me to comment on INEOS’ approach.”\n\nOn the football front, as well as being co-owners of Manchester United, INEOS has owned Swiss club Lausanne since 2017 and French side Nice since 2019. All three have women’s teams, and the latter two sport INEOS’ logo on their shirts.\n\nIn November 2023, Nice’s former general manager Jean-Luc Donati told local newspaper Nice-Matin there were more registered girls than boys in their youth sector. His goal was for the senior women’s team to one day reach the top flight too, and stay there. In the 2023-24 season, Nice’s women finished fourth in the French second division.\n\nIn French football, clubs are associations and the vast majority have just one commercial entity, usually the men’s team. The rest, such as the men’s academy, women’s team and football school fall under the management of the association. They do not tend to generate enough revenue to sustain costs and so require funding from the men’s side to support them.\n\nThe men’s first-team budget at Nice is estimated to be around €80million (£70m; $93.7m) per year. Before the 2024-25 season, the women’s team’s annual budget was around €1.4m. INEOS reduced that figure to €1m, and its support has been capped at €350,000 per year. Also ahead of that same 2024-25 campaign, around 10 players and former head coach Matthieu Esposito’s assistant and physios left the club, followed by Esposito himself in February.\n\nBefore that season, the French Football Federation introduced new rules to professionalise the women’s second division and stated teams must have a minimum of 11 players under federal contracts, similar to professional contracts, with working hours at least equal to part-time. If not, a club could be fined €1,250 per match.\n\nLast season, Nice, according to French media, only had three players on such contracts, the lowest in the league. Some teams in division three had more players on federal contracts than they did.\n\nNice managed to avoid relegation by two points, finishing ninth, last season. They sit in the same position in this campaign.\n\nLausanne’s women play in the third division and are the only club in the men’s elite competition not to have a women’s team in Switzerland’s top two divisions.\n\nIn November, an article on the club website detailed how the youth team ran laps around a pitch and raised 20,000 Swiss francs (around £18,800; $25,100) to support the women’s development section. The money, the report stated, will be used to pay for bus travel, team meals and a training camp, as well as team-building activities.\n\n“INEOS does not really show it wants to have a truly successful women’s team,” says Florian Paccaud, a sports journalist covering women’s football in Switzerland.\n\nAt Manchester United, over two years, INEOS has injected £238.5million into the club, excluding the cost of buying shares.\n\nThe women’s team’s total expenditure from the 2022-23 and 2023-24 seasons was £16million, as per club accounts. That is slightly inferior to Manchester City (£18m) and dwarfed by the outlay at Arsenal (£26m) and Chelsea (£33m).\n\nDr Christina Philippou, associate professor in sport finance at the University of Portsmouth, thinks INEOS is missing a trick by not investing \n\n“There’s still a lot of potential money coming in,” says Philippou. “If you invest, there is potential for money to keep coming your way.\n\n“If you don’t invest now, and others are willing to, that can be very problematic for your brand. You can fall away pretty quickly. Just because you have a big name in men’s football does not mean you will be thought of from a brand and commercial perspective if your women’s team is not competitive. That is the problem with not investing… If you don’t invest now, you could miss the boat for quite a few years.”\n\nBut, for some, women’s football is also a corporate social responsibility project or a positive PR move, and old-school perceptions remain.\n\n“You can’t remove the sexism angle,” says Philippou, talking generally about the attitude to investment in women’s football in the UK. “There is definitely an element of that, and you see it a lot with how women’s sport is still viewed by executives, fans and media.”\n\nA major organisation such as INEOS could significantly influence the culture of women’s sport — if it wanted to. “They’ll be on the wrong side of history if they don’t,” says the ex-pro cyclist.\n\nThe overwhelming sentiment expressed by many is that 73-year-old Ratcliffe and key decision-makers are from a past generation, one in which women’s professional sport did not exist in anything like the same way it does today. Ratcliffe, Andrew Currie, John Reece, Jonathan Ginns and Simon Morland form an all-male board at INEOS Limited, the parent company which sits at the top of the sprawling INEOS group. The board’s average age is 60.\n\nINEOS says it has a number of female CEOs and CEO-level executives, but they are on the petrochemicals side of the organisation. When asked who sits on the INEOS sports board alongside CEO Jean-Claude Blanc, it said it does not publish details of individual board members.\n\nINEOS’ sporting success on the men’s side has also been mixed, despite the huge investment.\n\nRatcliffe remarked in March, via BBC Sport, that Manchester United’s women’s team “are frankly doing better than the men’s team”, pointing to their second-place league position at the time and 2024 FA Cup final win, while a sale of Nice is being explored, as reported in May.\n\nKipchoge’s feat was historic, but INEOS ended its NN running team partnership and also withdrew from the America’s Cup challenge, having split with Ainslie in January. INEOS Grenadiers are in decline, registering their worst performance at the Tour de France since 2010 this summer, and INEOS settled a sponsorship dispute with New Zealand Rugby (NZR) in April, and another case with Tottenham Hotspur of the Premier League last month.\n\n“Five years ago, they could have done a lot,” says one observer with experience in the field. “Now… most people would say, ‘Focus on what you have, because you’re not doing very well’.”\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nManchester United, Premier League, Ligue 1, Sports Business, Women's Soccer, Global Sports, Cycling\n\n2025 The Athletic Media Company",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nRanking all 32 teams in the NFL from best to worst for every week in the 2025 regular season has been a wild ride. With such a top-heavy league, the hierarchy can see a big change based on a few particular results.\n\nThat has often caused teams to jump high or fade fast in relation to the others near the top. Even the back end has seen some significant reshuffling of late.\n\nHere's Sporting News' latest breakdown from the tippy top to rock bottom coming out of Week 16:\n\nMORE: Updated AFC, NFC playoff picture after Week 16 results\n\nThe Seahawks won that thriller over the Rams with the offense rebounding after a slow passing start. They need Sam Darnold to cut down on the mistakes and keep raising the big plays to live up to their lofty playoff position.\n\nThe Patriots went into more of an offensive slump in Baltimore with Drake Maye cooling and being contained again, putting their chances of stealing the AFC East in serious jeopardy.\n\nMORE: Patriots clinch playoff spot for first time since 2021\n\nThe Rams had no problems moving the ball without Davante Adams with Matthew Stafford spreading the ball around and getting more from the running game. But the secondary issues in Seattle became more prevalent when the front cannot get pressure.\n\nThe Broncos couldn't find enough clean offense from Bo Nix to make another fourth-quarter comeback in what looked more like a blowout loss to the Jaguars. Their defense, having key lapses, is a shaky late development.\n\nThe Jaguars had their true statement victory in Denver, making six straight wins. Their road domination and finishing well in the fourth quarter bodes well for their playoff profile.\n\nMORE: 6 reasons why Jaguars are legitimate Super Bowl contenders\n\nThe Bears should be thrilled to have the late-game comeback mode of Caleb Williams, always giving them a chance. Chicago is pushing toward being a tough out in the playoffs.\n\nMORE: Bears take control of NFC North with win over Packers\n\nThe Bills were caught in a tough battle down the road in Cleveland as Josh Allen's clunker against a tough defense was saved by James Cook and the running game. The defense was fortunate to face a team with limited weapons to survive\n\nThe Chargers went into Dallas and used it for a get-well offensive game with more juice from their defense, too. Justin Herbert needed that and so did Jim Harbaugh.\n\nThe 49ers should have loved the fact that the Seahawks took down the Rams on Thursday night. Their offense is red-hot and a win over the Colts would give them control of the division in the final two weeks.\n\nThe Eagles have got their offensive groove back with Saquon Barkley running well and Jalen Hurts' passing efficiently everywhere to silence the critics. They don't need to worry about the division anymore and can focus on getting into top shape for their Super Bowl defense in the playoffs.\n\nThe Packers saw Jordan Love get concussed in Chicago with Malik Willis playing well enough to win, but had too many offensive, defensive and special teams lapses to create a bigger mess than injuries.\n\nThe Texans were able to hold off the Raiders with resilient offense and just enough of their trademark defense. The hiccup is excusable with a win, but much must be fixed before facing the Chargers next week.\n\nMORE: Texans keep playoff hopes alive by escaping with win over Raiders\n\nThe Steelers found their running game again in Detroit to balance out the stellar run defense. They keep getting better at the right time to get into the playoffs on an uptick with Aaron Rodgers.\n\nThe Lions have been struggling to run the ball at will like they did last season and taking that element away, as the Steelers did. That and an injury-depleted defense have been the downfall for Detroit as a playoff contender.\n\nThe Panthers showed a lot of moxie in outlasting the Buccaneers with Bryce Young winning the biggest passing duel of his career. They have a great shot at making some noise should they get into the NFC playoffs.\n\nMORE: Panthers take control of NFC South with massive win over Buccaneers\n\nThe Colts will try to do more with a game Philip Rivers on Monday night against the 49ers with their season on the line, but the defense also may not oblige in a tough spot.\n\nThe Ravens had another defensive meltdown and other fourth-quarter big mistakes to blow another big lead, this time vs. the Patriots, spelling doom for a bad overall season, now maybe with Lamar Jackson not finishing healthy.\n\nMORE: Ravens' path to the postseason gets bleaker with loss to Patriots\n\nThe Buccaneers are making too many mistakes late in games, from the defense to Baker Mayfield. They can still get into the playoffs but there will be less inspiration for them to last long against a tough wild-card draw.\n\nThe Vikings can't seem to keep J.J. McCarthy healthy right when he builds positive momentum, but they still grounded out another win with enough clutch plays and more needed tough defense against what was a promising Giants offense.\n\nThe Cowboys look like they're running out of gas offensively to keep trying to make up for historically horrible all-around defense. This disappointment can't be blamed on Dak Prescott.\n\nThe Falcons are working to finish strong with wins over the Buccaneers and Cardinals making them feel better about the future of Raheem Morris as head coach. Credit Morris for getting them to be inspired with nothing left on the line.\n\nThe Chiefs can't be expected to win with their defense not having a pass rush and their offense not having a passing game minus Patrick Mahomes, Gardner Minshew and their top wide receiver. The fact they lost so easily on the road to the Titans is just so shocking.\n\nMORE: How Travis Kelce's retirement decision is easy with no Patrick Mahomes\n\nThe Saints took care of the lesser Jets at home with Tyler Shough chucking well with help from diverse weapons under Kellen Moore. He should go into Year 2 as the starting QB and the defense is also playing with a lot of late conviction.\n\nThe Bengals showed almost no life in Week 15 against the Ravens but got up off the mat to rip an overmatched and lesser-motivated Dolphins team with Joe Burrow needing that get-well performance late to try to end the season on a positive.\n\nThe Dolphins have faded fast from their rally back into playoff contention with dismal performances against the Steelers and Bengals in consecutive losses. Mike McDaniel can feel the heat again with the Tua Tagovailoa benching backfiring.\n\nThe Commanders just haven't fielded enough reliable defense all season long, with their age and youth showing in all the wrong places. They will just hope everything will change again with a healthy Jayden Daniels leading the offense.\n\nThe Titans are seeing a much-improved Cam Ward in recent weeks and it added up to a nice confidence-building win against the reeling Chiefs at home.\n\nThe Browns fought hard against the Bills with Shedeur Sanders showing the kind of fight and play that gets him a full-season audition as the starter in 2026 despite the defense falling apart around Myles Garrett.\n\nMORE: Myles Garrett inches closer to NFL sack record with obscure half sack\n\nThe Cardinals' positive offensive vibes have hit a wall with Jacoby Brissett and the rest of their backups, who have had too much pressure to compensate for a Jonathan Gannon potential lame-duck defense.\n\nThe Jets did their best to stay competitive with Brady Cook starting again at quarterback but the bigger problem is Aaron Glenn's shell of an overall defense. They are a really lost, bad team.\n\nMORE: Updated NFL draft order after Week 16\n\nJaxson Dart was due for a clunker and the Vikings' defense delivered it to him. The lumps have been there enough to go forward with a new coaching system all-around.\n\nThe Raiders showed more life with their offense in of all places, Houston against the Texans' nasty defense. They also played their most inspired defensive game in weeks. It still wasn't enough to overcome their lack of execution.",

    "description": "’Twas the last night at Delta Center, and the Utah Mammoth played Winnipeg on the Sabbath.",
    "fullText": "’Twas the last night at Delta Center, and the Utah Mammoth played Winnipeg on the Sabbath.\n\nNot a player was scoring — except Clayton Keller, whose overtime goal was so good it even surprised Tusky the Mammoth.\n\nTHE CAPTAIN GETS IT DONE 🫡\n\nClayton Keller scores the winner in @Energizer overtime! pic.twitter.com/lwC8no1aOM\n\nComing away with a 4-3 overtime win against the Winnipeg Jets, Keller and the Utah Mammoth delivered the best gift a Mammoth fan could ask for — an exciting overtime win at home ahead of the Christmas break.\n\nBut perhaps Dylan Guenther was the one who gave the best gift during this game, as he opted to give the puck up to Keller rather than take a shot of his own despite it having an open look.\n\n\"Me and Gunner [Guenther] actually chatted before overtime started,\" said Keller. \"He was like, let's come with a lot of speed and, you know, I think that was something that was in my head as I came on the ice.\"\n\nAdditionally, Guenther gave Keller a new record, as he recorded the fastest goal in Utah Mammoth history, scoring just 13 seconds into overtime and overtaking Lawson Crouse’s previous mark of 16 seconds against the Kraken on April 8.\n\nKnowing Guenther’s success — he has scored a game-winning goal in 19 of his 186 NHL games — it would have come as no surprise if he elected to shoot the puck himself. He was coming in with plenty of speed on a 2-on-1 and was in a great position to shoot.\n\nThat’s just it, though. Everyone in the stands, Jets goalie Connor Hellebuyck and maybe even the Utah bench was thinking Guenther would take the shot.\n\nSo rather than trying to add another overtime game-winner under his belt — specifically his fourth of the season had he scored the goal— Guenther made the smart play and passed the puck to a wide-open Keller.\n\n\"You cannot teach that. You just make the right play,\" said André Tourigny. \"If we will have odds to know 'Does he shoot that puck?,' the entire building will have said he will have [shot] it. The goalie probably thought the same. That's why he passed it.\"\n\nIt may have looked a bit different for Guenther, but the result was the same: The Utah Mammoth got a win, thanks in part to his play.\n\nGuenther is sure to be happy adding an overtime game-winning assist to his résumé, especially if it meant giving his captain a game-winner of his own.\n\nIt is the season of giving, after all.\n\nNo lead is safe in the NHL, and Utah knows that very well thanks to its last overtime win — a 5-4 victory against the Penguins in which Utah came back from three goals down. Fittingly, Guenther scored the overtime goal in that game.\n\nBut in this game, it was Winnipeg fighting for a comeback, not the Mammoth.\n\nDown 3-0 just three minutes into the second period, the Jets were struggling to keep the Mammoth away from their own net. Every attempt to clear the puck was met by a Utah player’s stick jarring it loose, leading to long shifts in the offensive zone and even a couple of goals going the Mammoth's way.\n\nJJ makes it 2-0! Way to play, fellas! 🔥 pic.twitter.com/WNqRQZRJlW\n\n— Utah Mammoth (@utahmammoth) December 22, 2025\n\nTo make matters worse, three of Utah’s four lines found themselves getting the puck into the back of the net, including fourth-liner Alexander Kerfoot, who scored in just his second game back from injury after missing Utah's first 36 games.\n\nThe Mammoth were scoring at will, and it didn’t matter who was on the ice. But just as things were beginning to look bleak, the Jets dug deeper and began to play harder.\n\nAt first, it started with just a couple of hard hits when Utah entered its offensive zone. Rather than letting Utah make any pass it wanted, Winnipeg upped its physicality and forced Utah to endure big hits.\n\nIt was a small change, but it showed the Jets were done allowing the Mammoth easy access to the net. Thanks to that physicality, Winnipeg eventually generated some offense of its own and drew a Utah penalty, with Kyle Connor scoring on the power play.\n\nMr. 300 goals 🚨🍗 pic.twitter.com/8sefqxqLmO\n\n— Winnipeg Jets (@NHLJets) December 22, 2025\n\nThe Jets had a long way to go, but they were able to cut Utah’s lead to 3-1 entering the third period and gained a bit of momentum.\n\nThough Utah played good defense for most of the third, Winnipeg struck, scoring two goals in just 25 seconds to tie the game 3-3, prompting a timeout from Tourigny.\n\nBANG BANG TO TIE IT ‼️ pic.twitter.com/emiOSlGi5P\n\n— Winnipeg Jets (@NHLJets) December 22, 2025\n\nWhile Keller eventually won the game for the Mammoth in overtime, it still allowed a division rival, fighting for a playoff spot, to snag a point it shouldn't have had.\n\n\"I think our third (period) there is obviously not great,\" said Keller. \"We still have to make plays, even if we're winning. Whatever the score is, they're gonna make a push. That's something that we've talked about and tried to get better at... I think that's something that we have to learn from and do moving forward.\"\n\nBut just like the Whos down in Whoville, Utah will still celebrate the win at the end of the day, even if it comes in overtime and the Grinch has already stolen the last can of Who hash.\n\nAre we sure Alexander Kerfoot has only played two games for the Mammoth? Because his performance against the Jets showed no signs of rust.\n\nAlready, in just his second game, Kerfoot’s time on ice has gone drastically up — from 8:14 against New Jersey the game prior to 13:49 — and he certainly deserves it if he’s going to keep scoring goals on the fourth line.\n\nBack like he never left! 👏\n\n🚨 Kerfy makes it 3-0, Mammoth! pic.twitter.com/3mA0oqkkkS\n\n— Utah Mammoth (@utahmammoth) December 22, 2025\n\n\"He’s such a great player. He can play anywhere in the lineup. He’s a great leader, someone that we missed when he was out. Just all the little things that he does on the bench, during the game, in the locker room. I can’t say enough great things about Kerf and how good of a person he is and player as well,\" said Keller. \"It's awesome getting him back. We definitely have had more juice since he's been back.\"\n\nConsidering how much the Mammoth relied on Kerfoot last year when dealing with injuries, it makes sense that Utah immediately had chemistry with him.\n\nBut in addition to his chemistry, Kerfoot is invaluable for Utah’s penalty kill. Against the Jets, he was already back to his disruptive ways, blocking shots and sending pucks back to Hellebuyck throughout the game.\n\nThe Mammoth were already the sixth-best penalty-kill unit in the league, killing 83% of opponent power plays before his return to the lineup. Imagine what Utah will be able to do now that he’s back in the lineup.",

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots are back in the win column thanks to a 28-24 win over the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday night. The victory, which helped New England secure a spot in the NFL playoffs for the first time since 2021, was hard-earned and saw the team overcome an 11-point deficit in the early fourth quarter.\n\nHere is a Patriots-centric view at some of the key moments of the game.\n\nDerrick Henry's 117th career rushing TD!\n\nNEvsBAL on NBC\nStream on @NFLPlus + Peacock pic.twitter.com/63luTxitUR\n\nThe Patriots defense couldn’t stop a nose bleed in the second half against the Buffalo Bills last Sunday, and things did not start any better against the Ravens. After receiving the opening kickoff, it took Baltimore only five plays to cover 65 yards and find the end zone on a 21-yard untouched Derrick Henry touchdown.\n\nMarlon Humphrey picks off Drake Maye!\n\nNEvsBAL on NBC\nStream on @NFLPlus + Peacock pic.twitter.com/8HQQe2GUE8\n\nLike the Ravens, the Patriots had some success on their opening possession. However, while they managed to drive into the Baltimore red zone their series found a quick and disappointing end: facing a 3rd-and-14, Drake Maye escaped the pocket to his right only to throw an interception to cornerback Marlon Humphrey with wide receiver Kayshon Boutte in the vicinity.\n\nHawkins knocks the ball loose from Henry for the turnover\n\nNEvsBAL on NBC\nStream on @NFLPlus + Peacock pic.twitter.com/dEZa8NZFCG\n\nAfter registering just three takeaways in their last six games, New England’s defense was able to get a big one in the late first quarter. While trying to fight for extra yards, Ravens running back Derrick Henry got the ball punched out on a gang tackle by Jaylinn Hawkins and Carlton Davis. Fellow Patriots DB Craig Woodson fell onto the ball for the recovery, preventing Baltimore from potentially going up by multiple scores.\n\nMaye to Henry to tie it up!\n\nNEvsBAL on NBC\nStream on @NFLPlus + Peacock pic.twitter.com/e2kloG2JrQ\n\nThe Patriots took full advantage of their fumble recovery, driving down the field in 10 plays to score their first points of the night. Selling a handoff to Rhamondre Stevenson, Drake Maye found Hunter Henry wide open in the end zone for a 1-yard touchdown to tie the game.\n\nAr'Darius Washington forces the Drake Maye fumble before half\n\nNEvsBAL on NBC\nStream on @NFLPlus + Peacock pic.twitter.com/iAZblTUjXD\n\nThe Patriots had a chance to get the upper hand at the end of the first half, moving into Andy Borregales’ field goal range for a fourth time. However, just like the first of those opportunities, New England came up empty-handed: Drake Maye was sacked from behind, coughing the ball up in the process. The Ravens fell on the fumble for their second takeaway of the game.\n\nThe Patriots fake punt cannot convert!\n\nNEvsBAL on NBC\nStream on @NFLPlus + Peacock pic.twitter.com/FN6q20LMae\n\nFacing a 4th-and-10 down four points in the late third quarter, and with the Ravens down to their backup quarterback, the Patriots decided to make a head-scratching decision. Instead of punting the ball, they ran a fake with personal protector Marte Mapu trying to execute a pass. However, the play was doomed from the start and Mapu eventually unable to salvage it. Seven plays later, the Ravens scored a touchdown to go up 24-13.\n\nDRAKE MAYE TO KYLE WILLIAMS.\n\nNEvsBAL on NBC\nStream on @NFLPlus + Peacock pic.twitter.com/ToEf565k29\n\nDown 11 points, the Patriots were in dire need of some offensive momentum. They found it in the form of a big touchdown pass from Drake Maye to Kyle Williams. New England’s quarterback hit the rookie down the right sideline for a 36-yard score. While not the most actively-involved member of the team’s wide receiver group, Williams has now caught three touchdowns on the season and is averaging 30 yards per catch. For Maye, meanwhile, the score put him over 300 yards in a game for the first time in his career.\n\nWhen the Patriots took over with 5:02 left in the game, they were still down three points. While that meant a field goal would tie the game, they had their sights set on victory. And a big fourth-down catch by wide receiver Stefon Diggs helped them accomplish that goal.\n\nMaye. Diggs. 4th down. Clutch.\n\nNEvsBAL on NBC\nStream on @NFLPlus + Peacock pic.twitter.com/6qywqsJnCi\n\nDiggs’ 21-yard gain on 4th-and-2 proved to be pivotal moment for the Patriots. Instead of potentially giving the ball back to Balti\n\nRHAMONDRE FOR THE LEAD.\n\nNEvsBAL on NBC\nStream on @NFLPlus + Peacock pic.twitter.com/VzcKV8z7Wd\n\nThe Patriots relied heavily on Rhamondre Stevenson against the Ravens, especially after rookie TreVeyon Henderson was lost to a head injury in the second quarter. Stevenson finished the game with eight carries for 51 yards, and also found the end zone twice: first on a two-point conversion after the Kyle Williams TD, and then on a 21-yard run to put New England up by four just outside the two-minute warning.\n\nCHAISSON FORCES THE FUMBLE.\n\nNEvsBAL on NBC\nStream on @NFLPlus + Peacock pic.twitter.com/k1qFLyors9\n\nThe Patriots defense collapsed in the second half against Buffalo last Sunday, but they held firm versus the Ravens. Tasked with preserving a four-point lead inside the two-minute warning, the unit delivered: on one of the better hustle plays you will see, K’Lavon Chaisson turned from pass rusher to pursuit player to force a Zay Flowers fumble that was recovered by Marcus Jones, giving the Patriots the ball and a chance to run out the clock.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIn most league formats, the fantasy football playoffs start in Week 16. For the quarterback position, all starters are in play -- for better or worse.\n\nWell, except for Patrick Mahomes, who suffered a season-ending torn ACL as the Chiefs' playoff hopes for this season also ended.\n\nLuckily, in most fantasy games, quarterback replacements from the waiver wire at least have a high weekly floor compared to other positions, and Mahomes managers have plenty of replacements.\n\n➕ UPGRADE YOUR PLAYOFF TOOLS: \nThese Week 17 quarterback rankings are based on 4-point passing touchdowns and one point for every 25 passing yards.\n\n↕️ Fantasy Rankings for Week 17\n\n📋 BEST PLAYOFF PICKUPS: Week 17 waiver wire guide\n\nThe Ravens' Lamar Jackson (back) left Sunday Night Football with a back injury, replaced by Tyler Huntley.\n\nJordan Love (concussion) was replaced by Malik Willis during the Packers' Saturday night loss to the rival Bears.\n\nJ.J. McCarthy (hand) might need season-ending surgery, leaving the Vikings to be stuck with potentially another Max Brosmer experiment.\n\nMarcus Mariota (throwing hand/quadriceps) day-to-day for the Commanders, leaving the definition of \"journeyman\" Josh Johnson as a possible replacement with Jayden Daniels (elbow) already shut down for the season.\n\nThe Chiefs fear that Gardner Minshew suffered some type of season-ending knee injury. With Patrick Mahomes (torn ACL) already done for the year, that leaves Chris Oladokun as a possibility to take snaps while Kansas City plays out the string on its lost season.\n\nWho's left? Trevor Lawrence has etched his name into the \"breakout star\" list from this season, who heading into his three-touchdown Week 16 hadn't finished lower than QB13 in his previous six outings -- including back-to-back QB1 overall finishes before Sunday.\n\nThe magical Liam Coen potion has revitalized another lost quarterback at the best possible time for fantasy players.\n\nThat being said, Lawrence sits behind Drake Maye and Matthew Stafford, who thrived even with Davante Adams (hamstring) on the sidelines.\n\n🐐 See where Trevor Lawrence ranks among QBs: Who has the most fantasy points in a game?\n\nWhile calling them \"sleepers\" is a stretch, the fact that every healthy QB is available shouldn't keep us from giving these names a boost:\n\nWith the surging 49ers' full cast of characters healthy, Brock Purdy is a strong top-5 option against a Bears secondary that caught a break with Jordan Love's injury Saturday. That defensive backfield will wilt against San Francisco's cadre of pass-catchers.\n\nKeep rolling out Joe Burrow (vs. Cardinals) and Dak Prescott (at Commanders), despite both teams' elimination from postseason contention.\n\nThe Buccaneers' Baker Mayfield should rebound after a tough draw against the Panthers against a Dolphins defense that won't contain Mike Evans and co.\n\nTyler Shough (at Titans), Kirk Cousins (vs. Rams), and even Quinn Ewers (vs. Buccaneers) deserve superflex/2QB matchup consideration, too, especially if you've lost Mahomes or Daniels recently and/or could face more injury woes with any of the handful in jeopardy.\n\nNEW - FANTASY TOOLS: NFL Player Stats | NFL Transactions | NFL Depth Charts | Fantasy Injury Reports\n\nWe're not keen on taking any of the top 13 quarterbacks out of lineups, but if you're streaming, Sam Darnold could fall short of QB1 expectations against a Panthers defense that can contain top quarterbacks.\n\nSame goes for Justin Herbert, who must deal with the Texans' elite pass defense.\n\nThe NFL has no more weekly byes for the 2025 regular season.

    "fullText": "Before leaving the game with a back injury late in the second quarter, Lamar Jackson appeared on his way to a strong outing. Jackson had completed 7-of-10 passes for 101 yards and made multiple off-script throws after buying time in the pocket. He connected with Zay Flowers for several long gains through the air and one of his three incompletions was a dropped pass. In Jackson’s relief, Tyler Huntley did a respectable job in the second half, leading consecutive touchdown drives at one point. Huntley completed all but one of his 10 pass attempts but only threw for 65 yards, with two yards on the ground.\n\nDerrick Henry’s lost fumble late in the first quarter was an early negative turning point, as it killed the Ravens’ momentum. They ultimately rebounded enough to take a double-digit lead later in the game. Henry had already rushed for a touchdown and 51 yards before fumbling and rumbled for more production after the blemish. He finished with 128 rushing yards in total on 18 carries with two touchdowns. Henry was strangely on the sidelines for the final two drives of the game despite dominating in the third quarter. It was quiet night from the rest of the running back room. Keaton Mitchell gained only 13 yards on nine carries while Rasheen Ali had two catches for two yards.\n\nFlowers did just about everything right all game until his final touch of the night, where he lost a fumble with just under two minutes remaining. The Ravens may not have driven down the field and scored a go-ahead touchdown anyways, but Flowers’ fumble sealed the fate of a loss. In total, Flowers finished with seven catches for 84 yards and added an 18-yard rushing touchdown in the third quarter. He made big catches and moved the sticks but the fumble, which has been his achilles heal, is a costly blemish. Deandre Hopkins had a strong performance with four receptions for 41 yards with multiple third-down contested catches to extend drives. Rashod Bateman was once again blanked on both his targets and Devontez Walker was not targeted.\n\nMark Andrews was a minimal factor in the passing game again with just two catches for 21 yards. He almost had a costly turnover as well with a head-scratching lateral pass attempt before halftime. It was ruled an illegal forward throw, which prevented a fumble that would have given the Patriots the ball in scoring range. Charlie Kolar had a nice 18-yard grab and Isaiah Likely was surprisingly not a factor with no targets. The tight ends collectively made a positive impact in run blocking and helped create some lanes for Henry.\n\nAside from some frustrating false start penalties on the same drive, the Ravens’ offensive line appeared to have one of their better games in recent weeks. Jackson was not sacked in the first half and Huntley was sacked only once across several drives. The Patriots managed five quarterback hits, but Baltimore’s pass protection was pretty solid. In run blocking, they drove open lanes for Henry all night and also helped create space for Flowers to find the end zone on his 18-yard end-around touchdown. As a team, the Ravens finished with 171 rushing yards and three touchdowns while averaging 5.2 yards per carry.\n\nThe Ravens’ defensive line was stout against the run for nearly the entire game, before Rhamondre Stevenson broke them down with a pair of long rushes late in the fourth quarter. Stevenson’s 21-yard touchdown and 11-yard first down pickup were back-breakers. Drake Maye and Treyveon Henderson were otherwise contained on the ground. In terms of pass rush, the Ravens’ defensive front did very little to get pressure through the interior on Maye. Travis Jones had one quarterback hit, but there was a lack of noticeable push up front.\n\nSpeaking of a lack of pass rush, that issue extends outside to the edge rushers as well. The final numbers of four sacks and 10 quarterback hits look good on paper, but too often Maye had clean pockets and plenty of time to throw for multiple plays in a row. Dre’Mont Jones had another solid showing with a timely sack and two quarterback hits, and Kyle Van Noy broke up a pass attempt that would have been a touchdown catch. The Ravens’ edge rushers deserve some credit for playing solid run defense for much of the game, but they badly needed more juice and disruption.\n\nRoquan Smith recorded a team-high 10 tackles and, along with Trenton Simpson, made some plays against the run. Smith’s lack of splash plays, however, is disappointing when considering his prominent role. Simpson had a sack and two tackles-for-loss in a starting role with Teddye Buchanan (knee) out for the rest of the year. The former third-round pick had a nice open-field tackle against Henderson. The Patriots were able to complete some longer throws over the middle of the field above the heads of the linebackers. Their tight ends Hunter Henry and Austin Hooper combined for eight catches and 69 yards with a touchdown.\n\nMarlon Humphrey’s night started off well after he corralled an interception on the Patriots’ opening drive of the game. From there on out, his performance went downhill. Humphrey was beat for a long touchdown in single coverage of Kyle Williams, which gave the Patriots much-needed life in the fourth quarter. He also ceded several catches to Stefon Diggs as the primary defender and should have been called for defensive pass interference on a long pass attempt to Keyshon Boutte late. Nate Wiggins had two pass breakups and nearly came up with a huge interception late in the game. He timed a break on a slant route perfectly but could not pull down the ball, which would have given the Ravens the ball back with the lead and a few minutes remaining. The Ravens surely would have liked to have had the services of Chidobe Awuzie, who was inactive with a foot injury.\n\nAlohi Gilman had an up-and-down night, as he was victimized by some missed open-field tackles but also finished with eight total and a pass breakup as well. Kyle Hamilton had a strong tackle-for-loss to prevent a long Henderson run and a pass breakup of his own, too. Ar’Darius Washington was party to one of the defensive plays of the game, where he forced a fumble on Maye just before halftime. That prevented the Patriots from getting a field goal or touchdown and taking a lead into the break. Washington finished with two quarterback hits, a sack, and a tackle-for-loss. He was beaten by Diggs in coverage on a key fourth-and-short pass late in the game. Malaki Starks had three solo tackles on the night.\n\nThe play of the game on special teams was the Ravens dismantling a fake punt attempt by the Patriots late in the third quarter, which was defended nicely by Devontez Walker. It wasn’t a great night for the unit aside from that moment. Tyler Loop was well short on a 56-yard attempt in the second quarter while making his other try and all three extra points. Jordan Stout’s two punts went for 40 and 45 yards, respectively.",

    "title": "‘Utah brings out the worst in us’: Mammoth’s hot start frustrates Jets, Utah wins in OT",
    "description": "It took overtime to get it done, but the Mammoth move into a playoff spot after their 4-3 win over the Jets.",
    "fullText": "If the Utah Mammoth make the playoffs this season, it’s incredibly likely that the Winnipeg Jets don’t — and vice versa.\n\nFor that reason, their matchup on Sunday was among the more important games either team will play this year. The Mammoth pulled off the win, but it took the skin of their teeth to get it done. Here’s the story.\n\nWhen the Mammoth took a 3-0 lead 23 minutes in, it looked like they’d waltz away with a regulation win against the Jets for the second time this season.\n\nBut hockey is a 60-minute game. It doesn’t end when one team takes a three-goal lead.\n\nKyle Connor began the Jets’ comeback with a power play goal midway through the second period. He doubled up with a nearly identical tally late in the third, and 15 seconds later, Morgan Barron struck to tie the game.\n\n“We would have loved to close the game right there. I think we got a little bit nervous,” said Mammoth head coach André Tourigny. “We lost our composure with the puck. I often say there’s two (important things) when you’re protecting a lead: Having poise with the puck ... and to have a lot of pace defensively, which is our strength.\n\n“... We became a little bit too conservative and they were able to come back.”\n\nIf there’s one aspect of Utah’s game that strikes fear into opponents, though, it’s when Dylan Guenther has the puck in overtime.\n\nHe’s tied for the league lead in both overtime goals and game-winning goals this season, and he finished in the top six in both categories last year.\n\nOn Sunday, it was his passing that made him a threat.\n\nGuenther collected the puck in the defensive zone, dipsy-doodled around his man in the neutral zone and found Clayton Keller in the offensive zone.\n\nAll it took was a perfectly placed shot for the captain to net the OT winner.\n\nCLAYTON KELLER OT FIST BUMPS! pic.twitter.com/1XAZqc8kdk\n\n— Utah Mammoth (@utahmammoth) December 22, 2025\n\nUtah winning in regulation prevents the other team from getting a point in the standings, so given the tightness of the playoff race the Mammoth would have liked to get it done earlier, but this was their second-best outcome.\n\n“Utah brings out the worst in us,” said Jets head coach Scott Arniel after the game. “That’s a bad start by everybody, and it just got us behind the 8-ball and then we’re chasing the game.”\n\nOf course, some of Arniel’s greatest success came in Utah: He won the Turner Cup while playing for the Utah Grizzlies in 1996.\n\nAfter returning from the first long-term injury of his NHL career last Friday, there was a question mark regarding how quickly Alexander Kerfoot would be able to get back to his old self.\n\nHe’d played the second-fewest minutes on the team against the New Jersey Devils on Friday and he hadn’t participated in a single proper practice this season until Saturday.\n\nNobody would have blamed him for taking a few games to get his stride back, but he didn’t waste any time.\n\nKerfoot scored on Sunday, sneaking behind the Jets’ defenseman and sending a perfect one-timer past Connor Hellebuyck, who’s widely considered the best goalie in the world.\n\nAdditionally, Kerfoot played a perfect 1:39 on the penalty kill and increased his ice time by more than five and a half minutes game over game.\n\nBack like he never left! 👏\n\n🚨 Kerfy makes it 3-0, Mammoth! pic.twitter.com/3mA0oqkkkS\n\n— Utah Mammoth (@utahmammoth) December 22, 2025\n\n“He’s such a great player,” Keller said of Kerfoot. “He can play up and down the lineup. He’s a great leader. Something that we missed while he was out, like, just all the little things that he does on the bench, during the game, in the locker room, like, I can’t say enough great things about Kerf and how good of a person he is — and player as well.\"\n\nFor the second time in his NHL career, Sean Durzi is on a five-game point streak. He also has six points in his last seven games.\n\nHe’s done it quietly, though: a goal here, an assist there. Utah’s second power play unit, which he quarterbacks, has shown vast improvement in recent weeks and for the most part, Durzi has been good defensively, too.\n\nTourigny chalked it up to good chemistry between Durzi and his defense partner, Mikhail Sergachev, who added a pair of assists on Sunday for eight points in his last 10 games.\n\n“Durz, every game, makes really good plays,” Tourigny said. “He needs to keep improving his consistency. The upside is there. The fact he missed a lot of hockey two seasons in a row, sometimes can affect his consistency.\n\n“That said, lately he’s getting better every game, so we like that.”\n\nEvery good team has a reliable top defense pairing that’s capable of playing big minutes while keeping the puck out of their net and contributing frequent offense. If Durzi and Sergachev can keep this type of play up over long stretches, the Mammoth will be in a good position going forward.\n\nOn a night when Sidney Crosby passed Mario Lemieux for most points in Pittsburgh Penguins franchise history, Kyle Connor won’t get as many flowers as he otherwise might, so we’ll give him some here.\n\nConnor scored career goals number 300 and 301 on Sunday, and they’ve all come in a Jets uniform. He trails only Mark Scheifele and Ilya Kovalchuk for most goals in franchise history, and he’s second in that category since the franchise’s move to Winnipeg.\n\nOn the league-wide all-time list, he jumped active San Jose Sharks forward Tyler Toffoli and tied himself with Ulf Dahlen for 239th place, and at age 29, he has plenty of time left to soar much higher.\n\nAlso, he’s the second-fastest American to reach the 300-goal plateau.\n\n“Pretty cool milestone,” Connor said after the game. “Once you look back on your career, that’s the kind of stuff you’ll remember, but right now, it’s focusing on winning and trying to be the best player I can and help out, so it doesn’t really mean much right now.”\n\nAt this point last season, Lawson Crouse had six goals and nine points. This year, he’s at nine and 15, respectively — a pace much closer to what his norm from Arizona.\n\n“I think probably my mindset,” he said when asked what the difference between the two seasons is. “Trying not to let little things bother me, try to be a little bit easier on myself, and I think that’s been paying off.”\n\nWhat a shot from the Sheriff! 🤠\n\n1-0, Utah! pic.twitter.com/CsNxm4M7S7\n\n— Utah Mammoth (@utahmammoth) December 22, 2025",

    "fullText": "The Patriots celebrated a crucial victory on “Sunday Night Football,” defeating the Baltimore Ravens 28-24. This win not only secured New England a playoff spot but also boosted quarterback Drake Maye’s standing in the MVP race.\n\nMaye threw for 380 yards, completing two touchdowns and one interception. As of Monday, FanDuel listed Maye with the second-best odds to win the MVP at +170, just behind Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford, who is at -195.\n\nStafford and the Rams lost to the Seattle Seahawks on Thursday. However, the defeat wasn’t due to Stafford’s performance, as he threw for an impressive 457 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nMaye still has a shot at winning MVP, but he’ll need Stafford to struggle in the next couple of weeks. Los Angeles will face the Atlanta Falcons and the Arizona Cardinals during that time, both of which are teams already eliminated from postseason contention, which could make it hard for Stafford to struggle.\n\nMaye will have an opportunity to improve his stats when the Patriots play against the New York Jets and the Miami Dolphins the next two weeks.\n\nEven if Maye doesn’t win the MVP this season, he will likely have a chance to earn the award in the coming years if he keeps up his impressive performance.\n\nMike Vrabel Gives Honest Reaction To Patriots’ Playoff-Clinching Win",

    "description": "How is early voting looking for Andruw Jones and the Hall of Fame?",
    "fullText": "With the week of Christmas here, many of the top free agents in baseball remained unsigned. This includes some of the best starting pitching arms, including Framber Valdez, Zac Gallen, Ranger Suarez, and Tatsuya Imai. While this development is not entirely surprising, the timing of when signings could occur now becomes a bit harder to predict, especially with the holidays over the next two weeks.\n\nThe Braves likely remain involved in many of the conversations focusing on adding a starting pitcher. And with the added bonus of not having traded away any prospects to feel their offseason needs, they could always pivot to the trade market as well. The good thing is that many avenues remain available for the Braves to strengthen their already strong rotation, even if it could into the new year when the move finally occurs.\n\nWe are less than away from the 2026 MLB Hall of Fame class being announced, which currently is scheduled for 01/20/2026/. In the very early going, Andruw Jones and Carlos Beltran are at the top of the class in votes. Both are at 78% per Ryan Thibodaux’s vote tracking on BlueSky. While this should be taking with a grain of salt with less than 10% of the votes known, it is an encouraging start.\n\nMunetaka Murakami signed a two-year, $34M deal with the Chicago White Sox. With his deadline to sign happening Monday, Murakami found a home in Chicago that he hopes can lead to a bigger deal down the road.\n\nThe Blue Jays are the latest team to reportedly have interest in Alex Bregman.",

    "fullText": "Bayern Munich returned to winning ways yesterday, claiming an emphatic 4-0 away win over Heidenheim with Harry Kane putting the gloss on proceedings, bagging the final goal in 90+2.\n\nThe England international missed some big chances earlier but eventually netted to take his tally of goals in 2025 for club and country to 60.\n\nHe has registered 30 goals in 25 appearances this season.\n\nKane has now tallied 19 goals and three assists in the Bundesliga this season, taking him to 100 goal contributions (81G & 19A) in only 78 appearances, becoming the fastest player to do so.\n\nHe has surpassed the record previously held by Bayern legend Arjen Robben, who took 119 games to reach the 100-mark tally.\n\nInterestingly, Kane also captained Bayern in the absence of Manuel Neuer and Joshua Kimmich, jumping ahead of the queue for the armband due to his leadership qualities.\n\nNo one has more goal contributions than the Bayern ace in Europe’s top five leagues in the past three seasons.\n\nKane has continued to break record after record in Germany. Just weeks ago, he became the fastest player to reach 10 hat-tricks, achieving it after just 76 Bundesliga appearances.\n\nIt took the great Robert Lewandowski 324 games to tally that figure.\n\nKane looks set to spearhead Bayern to another Bundesliga crown, and Die Rekordmeister will have one eye on the UEFA Champions League title.\n\nWith the mercurial Englishman leading the line, they can claim that elusive seventh Champions League crown.\n\nElsewhere, England boss Thomas Tuchel will be hoping the 32-year-old can avoid any serious injuries and carry this form till the end of the season.\n\nThe Three Lions head to the 2026 World Cup at the end of the season as one of the favourites for the title, and Kane will be key to their chances of success.\n\nHe has been excellent under Tuchel, and the German tactician will be banking on the former Tottenham Hotspur star to fire England over the line.",

    "description": "Former England forward Wayne Rooney hails Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice as a \"future captain of England\".",
    "fullText": "Former England striker Wayne Rooney has hailed Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice as a \"future captain\" of the Three Lions after watching the 26-year-old help the Gunners return to the top of the Premier League with victory at Everton.\n\nRooney, who captained England for three years from 2014 to 2017, was at the Hill Dickinson Stadium to see Mikel Arteta's side secure a scrappy 1-0 win on Saturday evening.\n\nRice, who has won 72 caps at senior international level, has worn the armband twice before in the absence of current skipper Harry Kane – in a 2-2 draw with Belgium in March 2024 and a 3-0 win over Wales in October this year.\n\n\"For me, he's the one who's probably waiting for Harry to hang up his boots at some point,\" Rooney said in the latest episode of BBC Sport's The Wayne Rooney Show.\n\n\"He was all over the pitch [against Everton]. His decision-making – when to pass it, where to pass it, what foot to pass it to, his detail on his pass – it was a pleasure to watch. He was absolutely incredible.\n\n\"He was splitting centre-backs, taking the ball off [Arsenal's] centre-backs, acting as a third centre-back, then next minute he's in the box, trying to score a goal. Sometimes, some of the stuff he does is a bit underrated.\n\n\"He's the right one to take over [Kane] for me, because [of] his drive, his personality. Everyone seems to love him, who knows him, who's close to him. He's irreplaceable for England.\"\n\nAfter a difficult start to his Leeds United career, Rooney's former Everton team-mate Dominic Calvert-Lewin has hit a purple patch in recent weeks.\n\nThe 28-year-old had scored just once in 10 league appearances prior to Leeds' 3-2 defeat at Manchester City last month but has now found the net in each of his past five outings, scoring twice in Saturday's 4-1 win over Crystal Palace at Elland Road.\n\nRooney feels the striker could yet force his way into Thomas Tuchel's squad for next summer's World Cup in the USA, Mexico and Canada.\n\n\"If he continues this, then there's no reason why he shouldn't be talked about – or even get an opportunity – to go to the World Cup, purely because of the lack of forwards England have got,\" Rooney said.\n\n\"He competes, he's great in the air, he's good in both boxes. When he's in a run of form and scoring goals like he is, he's a handful to play against.\n\n\"You forget, he's still quite young, he's still got a bit left in him and you forget how good a player he is.\"\n\nCalvert-Lewin scored 71 goals during his time at Everton but only found the net three times in his final season with the club, missing over three months of the campaign with a hamstring injury.\n\n\"I think Everton made the right decision [to let him go],\" Rooney continued. \"Over the past couple of seasons, he was never fit, really, and he was out of contract.\n\n\"It would have been very difficult for Everton to give him a new contract with his injury record, but he's gone to Leeds, kept himself fit. The physios are doing a good job with him there.\"\n\nDespite scoring the only goal against David Moyes' side, Arsenal striker Viktor Gyokeres has struggled for form since his summer move from Sporting.\n\nThe Sweden international's emphatic penalty was his seventh goal in all competitions this season – and first since a 2-0 victory at Burnley on 1 November.\n\nRooney, though, feels Gyokeres should not only be judged by his goalscoring record.\n\n\"He does a bit more than what you see,\" he said. \"Even [on Saturday], he occupies the two centre-backs, [James] Tarkowski and Michael Keane. That creates a bit more space for your number 10 or your wide players who are coming inside.\n\n\"I think he's important for Arsenal. He's doing a job which helps other players, he just hasn't got the goals which you'd expect from him.\n\n\"You maybe don't see it, it's not eye-catching, but he does occupy the centre-back. Can he be better? Of course he can. Should he score more goals playing in that team? Yeah, he should.\n\n\"But I think if Arsenal go on to win the league, then he'll have had a big role to play, definitely.\"\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "A couple of months ago, I received a request from a random Internet user to add CSRF protection to my little web framework Microdot, and I thought it was a fantastic idea.When I set off to do this…",
    "fullText": "A couple of months ago, I received a request from a random Internet user to add CSRF protection to my little web framework Microdot, and I thought it was a fantastic idea.\n\nWhen I set off to do this work in early November I expected I was going to have to deal with anti-CSRF tokens, double-submit cookies and hidden form fields, pretty much the traditional elements that we have used to build a defense against CSRF for years. And I did start along this tedious route. But then I bumped into a new way some people are dealing with CSRF attacks that is way simpler, which I describe below.\n\nAn often shared piece of advice is that you should never implement security features yourself. Instead, you should look for well established solutions built by people who think about security day in and day out.\n\nUnfortunately, as the lead (and only) maintainer of Microdot, I do not have an ecosystem of existing solutions available to me. Even though I gladly accept external contributions, most of the framework has been built by myself out of nothing. So in this case, like many other times before, I felt I had no choice but to go against the standard advice and write CSRF protection code by myself, because if I didn't do it then the feature would not be built.\n\nWhat is the first step when you need to build a security feature? Check out what OWASP has to say about the matter.\n\nSo, in early November, I opened OWASP's CSRF Prevention Cheat Sheet page to see what was new and interesting in the world of CSRF protection. And I found that nothing of significance had changed.\n\nAccording to OWASP, the best CSRF protection you could get (at the time I checked) was still built around the idea of using anti-CSRF tokens. So I set off to implement this for Microdot.\n\nI was happily making progress on my CSRF implementation, and then in early December, another random Internet user dropped an issue on the Flask repository, proposing that Flask adds support for \"modern\" CSRF protection. Modern? How could there be a new way to protect against CSRF that isn't mentioned by OWASP?\n\nThis led me down a rabbit hole of blog posts and discussions spanning the Go and Ruby communities, plus a long discussion about this method on the OWASP GitHub repository itself, resulting in a pull request that added a mention of this method to the CSRF Cheat Sheet, only a couple of weeks after I went to this page looking for guidance for my own implementation.\n\nThe so called \"modern\" method to protect against CSRF attacks is based on the Sec-Fetch-Site header, which all modern desktop and mobile browsers include in the requests they send to servers. According to Mozilla, all browsers released since March 2023 have support for this header.\n\nThe Sec-Fetch-Site header can have one of four values:\n\nThe value of this header cannot be set via JavaScript, so the server can assume that a) if this header is present, then the client is a web browser, and b) the value of the header can be trusted. So basically, the server can reject requests that come with this header set to cross-site, and in essence that is all you need to do to protect against CSRF!\n\nAfter seeing this, I paused my work on the token-based CSRF implementation and spent a few hours to implement this modern approach. As always, the devil is in the details, so let's see what else I needed to do to build a complete solution.\n\nFirst of all, in some cases subdomains sharing the same registered domain may operate independently, and as such, it is not out of the question that one subdomain may attempt to attack another through CSRF. Depending on the level of trust an application has for other subdomains, a server may want to block requests that come with the Sec-Fetch-Site header set to same-site. In Microdot, I have added an argument allow_subdomains to cover this case. I decided to err on the side of security, so the default is False, meaning that requests from subdomains are also blocked.\n\nThe other big problem is that not everyone is using a recent browser that implements this header. Looking at the browser compatibility for the Sec-Fetch-Site header, you can see that most browsers implemented this feature long ago, between 2019 and 2021, with one notable exception: Safari. Apple added this header to its browser in 2023, so it is reasonable to assume that there are still users out there running older browsers that do not support it.\n\nOne option is to reject all requests that do not have the Sec-Fetch-Site header. This keeps everyone secure, but of course, there's going to be some unhappy users of old devices that will not be able to use your application. Plus, this would also reject HTTP clients that are not browsers. If this is not a problem for your use case, then great, but it isn't a good solution overall.\n\nFrom what I gathered from looking at other implementations of this method, an accepted solution is to use the Origin header as fallback when Sec-Fetch-Site is not implemented, since this header has been around for much longer. The last of the major browsers to add it were Firefox desktop in 2019 and Edge and Firefox mobile in 2020. Like Sec-Fetch-Site, the Origin header is also a restricted header that is set by the browser, so it can also be used to determine from where a request is coming from.\n\nThe problem with using the Origin header is that it isn't always easy to know what is the correct origin that applies to a web application. The standard option is to compare the value of the Origin header against the value of the Host header, but Host only includes the hostname and port, while Origin also includes the scheme. Also, the Host header is overwritten as it passes through reverse proxies. So comparing these two headers is actually not easy.\n\nAnother, more direct option is to ask the user to configure the expected origin name explicitly. To keep things simple, in Microdot I opted for the explicit configuration, for which I linked to the existing Cross-Origin Request Sharing (CORS) support. The CORS feature already maintains a list of allowed origins, so my CSRF logic automatically trusts these. I decided to not complicate myself adding support for Host header checks at this time, but maybe I'll add this in the future.\n\nFilippo Valsorda, a security developer active in the Go ecosystem (and author of the popular mkcert tool) wrote a blog post about this method that you may want to check out if you want to learn more details about it. He seems to be the first to propose this method and has implemented it for the Go standard library.\n\nAlso if you are interested, feel free to review my implementation of CSRF protection in Microdot. Have a look at the documentation, the code and an example, and let me know if you have any improvements or fixes to suggest.\n\nAs I mentioned above, the CSRF Prevention Cheat Sheet page from OWASP was updated in early December to include the use of the Sec-Fetch-Site header in the list of prevention methods. But this method is listed as a defense in depth mechanism, and not a complete solution.\n\nI referenced the discussion in the OWASP GitHub repository that resulted in the recent changes made to the Cheat Sheet page. Several participants in that discussion have suggested that this method should be upgraded to a complete alternative to the standard token-based approaches. The OWASP maintainer was initially skeptical, but towards the end of the thread they appear to be warming up to the idea and in search of opinions from other leading security experts. So it is quite possible that this method will become mainstream in the near future.\n\nI consider that in Microdot, going from no CSRF support at all to this is a great step forward that is also consistent with the minimalist ethos of the project. I will be keeping an eye on the OWASP CSRF Cheat Sheet page to see if they end up elevating this new protection method to the top level, and if they don't, I still have a mostly complete implementation of double-submit anti-CSRF tokens that I can bring into my project.\n\nWhat I like the most about working in open source is that all the work happens in the open, so it is a permanent record that can be searched and reviewed. My CSRF protection journey started as a somewhat tedious exercise in the use of cryptography and cookies, but then thanks to an unexpected lead it turned into a fun and exciting learning opportunity for me.",

    "description": "When I first built our AI assistant, it had five tools. Look up an order. Process a refund. Check ticket availability. Simple stuff.",
    "fullText": "When I first built our AI assistant, it had five tools. Look up an order. Process a refund. Check ticket availability. Simple stuff. Fast forward six months and we're at nearly 40 tools spanning orders, events, marketing campaigns, contests, and customer management.\n\nThe problem became obvious during a routine cost review: we were burning thousands of tokens on every single request just describing tools the model would never use. Someone asks \"What time does my show start?\" and we're sending the full spec for process_refund, create_email_campaign, and manage_contest_prizes. Wasteful.\n\nEach tool definition isn't trivial. You need a name, a description detailed enough for the LLM to understand when to use it, and parameter specifications with types and constraints. Here's what one looks like in our codebase:\n\nMultiply by 40 and you're looking at 3,000+ tokens before the user even says anything. The costs add up, latency increases, and here's the kicker: having too many tools actually makes the model worse at picking the right one. More noise, more confusion.\n\nThe fix is conceptually simple. Instead of sending every tool on every request, we embed all tool descriptions into vectors and store them in Postgres using pgvector. When a query comes in, we embed it too, then find the 5-10 most semantically similar tools using cosine distance.\n\nThe query \"refund order #12345\" gets embedded, compared against all tool embeddings, and returns process_refund, calculate_refund_amount, get_order_details. We send only those to the LLM.\n\nThis cuts our tool payload by 75-90% on most requests. The model sees fewer, more relevant options and picks better.\n\nWe debated two main approaches: calling OpenAI's embedding API or running our own model.\n\nOpenAI's text-embedding-3-small is the path of least resistance. It's a REST call, returns 1536-dimensional vectors, costs about a hundredth of a cent per embedding, and just works. The semantic understanding is excellent. The downside is the external dependency. Every query needs a network round-trip, your data touches their servers, and you're subject to their rate limits and outages.\n\nRunning something like ModernBERT locally is appealing for different reasons. Zero marginal cost, sub-millisecond latency since there's no network hop, and complete data privacy. But now you're managing infrastructure. You need a server running the model, monitoring, scaling considerations, and you're on the hook for model selection and updates. For a small team, that operational burden is real.\n\nThere's also a hybrid approach: use OpenAI in production for reliability, run a local model in development and testing to avoid API costs and flakiness. We built our system with a provider abstraction to make this possible:\n\nSwitching providers is a config change. The abstraction cost an extra hour upfront but buys flexibility later.\n\nFor our volume, OpenAI was the obvious choice. We process hundreds of queries daily, not millions. At $0.00001 per embedding, we're talking pennies per month. The reliability is excellent, the semantic quality is strong for our e-commerce domain, and there's zero infrastructure to manage.\n\nIf we were processing millions of queries or had strict data residency requirements, the calculus would be different. But for a small team running a ticketing platform, paying a few cents to avoid running another service is a good trade.\n\nAdding a new tool or updating an existing one means regenerating embeddings. In development, it's a mix task:\n\nThis iterates through all tool definitions, calls OpenAI for each, and upserts the results into the tool_embeddings table. Takes about 10 seconds for 40 tools. The task is idempotent so you can run it whenever.\n\nThe implementation is straightforward. We convert each ToolDefinition to embedding text that captures the name, description, and parameter info, then store the vector alongside the tool name and model ID.\n\nFor production, we built a simple admin page. Navigate to the AI operations screen, see the current embedding count, click a button to regenerate. Non-technical team members can trigger it after tool updates without touching the console.\n\nThe alternative is shelling into the production console:\n\nEither way, regeneration is safe to run anytime. It deletes existing embeddings and creates fresh ones. The whole process takes seconds.\n\nOne gotcha: if you ever switch embedding providers, you must regenerate everything. OpenAI's 1536-dimension vectors are incompatible with a local model's 768-dimension vectors. We store model_id with each embedding to catch mismatches and make debugging easier.\n\nPure similarity search has a gap. If someone says \"refund order #12345\", we'll find process_refund. But the LLM also needs get_order_details to look up the order before it can refund anything. Those two tools aren't semantically similar enough to both appear in the top results.\n\nWe solved this with category expansion. Each tool has a category like :orders, :refunds, or :events. When we select tools via similarity, we expand to include related categories:\n\nSo finding process_refund (category :refunds) automatically pulls in order lookup tools. The LLM gets everything it needs for multi-step workflows.\n\nFor those curious about the database side, here's the actual query we run:\n\nThe <=> operator is pgvector's cosine distance. We filter by a similarity threshold (0.4 by default) to avoid returning completely irrelevant tools, then take the top K results. The whole thing runs in under 10ms.\n\nWe use Mimic for mocking in tests. Every test that touches tool selection stubs the embedding provider to return consistent vectors:\n\nThis keeps tests fast, deterministic, and free of API dependencies. We can simulate failures too, testing that the system gracefully falls back to using all tools when embedding generation fails.\n\nA few things surprised us along the way.\n\nThe similarity threshold matters more than we expected. Too high and you filter out useful tools. Too low and you're back to noise. We settled on 0.4 after some experimentation but it's worth tuning for your domain.\n\nCategory expansion was an afterthought that became essential. Pure semantic similarity misses the dependencies between tools. If your assistant does multi-step operations, you need something like this.\n\nThe provider abstraction was worth it even though we haven't switched providers. It forced us to think cleanly about the interface and made testing much easier. The Mimic stubs work because there's a clear boundary to mock.\n\nCold start is a real concern. If your embeddings table is empty, you need a fallback. We log a warning and use all tools, which isn't ideal but prevents complete failure.\n\nAfter rolling this out, our per-request token usage for tool definitions dropped 60-80%. Latency improved by about 200ms since the model processes fewer tokens. Tool selection accuracy actually got slightly better because there's less noise confusing the model.\n\nThe embedding costs are negligible. We're at maybe $0.01 per day for our volume. The whole system adds a 10ms database query per request, which disappears in the noise of the LLM call.\n\nFor anyone dealing with tool explosion in their AI agents, this approach is worth considering. The implementation isn't complex, the costs are minimal, and the benefits compound as your tool count grows.",

From those with an established tale to tell, to games where your choices really matter, these story-based games ask a little more of us, but give a whole lot back.\n\nHere, we've rounded up the best story games every narrative game lover should play, plus some surprises from games that don't push their story front and center, but still tick all the boxes. Plenty of these titles would also be at home in the best indie games hall of fame, but we've snuck in a few AAA games with great stories as well. Some are subversive games that will mess with your head, while others craft a cozy game narrative where you can be the hero of your own story. There's something here for every kind of gamer.\n\nThen of course, once you're finished here, go and figure out what book you should read based on your favourite game.\n\nClair Obscur: Expedition 33 has been arguably the biggest hit of 2025 so far. A gorgeous RPG that mixes thrilling turn-based combat with a heartbreaking, challenging story – if you play just one game this year, make it this one. Even the legendary Hideo Kojima has said he's a big fan of the game, so we're among excellent company.\n\nIn our review of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, we were most struck by the complex and honest reflections on death, fate, and inevitability – how do you stay strong in the face of a seemingly set ending? Where do you gather your strength when the odds seem stacked against you? Clair Obscur has many strengths in its combat and world design, but it's the story that will stick with you long after completion, making it a great entry to kick off this list.\n\nFanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fandom.\n\nMuch is made of its brutal combat, but Elden Ring's worldbuilding is also the stuff of legend. It's got it all – sinister locations rich with history, rounded characters tied by the strands of fate, and a vast open-world where the story unravels at the player's own pace. With Nightreign – an experimental, multiplayer non-sequel – fans can glean more information about the mysterious world of Elden Ring through new events and stories.\n\nIn our review of Elden Ring Nightreign, we were surprised by the quality of the stories despite the multiplayer-centric structure. If you're craving more forays into this grim fantasy landscape, you won't want to let this one pass you by. You don't have to go in unprepared, either. We've already put together a list of the best Elden Ring Nightreign mods, as well as a range of Elden Ring Nightreign guides on anything from picking a class to how to beat the Darkdrift Knight Boss.\n\nWanderstop is a calming, yet challenging, tea shop management simulator with a twist from the creator of The Stanley Parable. The game begins with a mystery: a fierce, unstoppable fighter suddenly finds themselves unable to wield their sword properly. Again and again they're beaten in battle, until it becomes clear they're experiencing some kind of burnout. Their method of pushing through the pain begins to fail, and they're made to slow down with a job at a tea shop. They hate every minute of it.\n\nIn our review of Wanderstop, we praised the game's writing as brutally honest about the impact of burnout and the sacrifices recovery sometimes asks of us. The management side is good fun, allowing you to brew teas with just about any ingredients you can find, but the tender story is the star of the show. If you find your perfectionist brain starting to creep in, we've put together this Wanderstop Recipes Guide, featuring all the tea recipes and how to make them. We love a happy customer.\n\nLost Records: Bloom and Rage is a two-part adventure from the team behind Life is Strange. Set across the dual timelines of 1995 and 2022, the player inhabits the shoes of Swann, a young girl starting a punk band with her best friends. Using a camcorder to record your experience, and making fast-thinking choices to decide how events play out, you'll uncover the mystery behind a dark event that no one has dared speak about until now.\n\nLost Records is a deeply immersive game that never shies away from being raw, messy, and honest. We noted in our review of Lost Records: Bloom and Rage that it perfectly captures the magic and melodrama of our teenage years, and the way these events get muddied over time.\n\n1000XResist is a groundbreaking, heartrending, sci-fi epic told across the span of a thousand years of whispers and lies. Taking on the coveted role of Watcher in an underground all-female society, you're shown snippets of what came before – the disease that wiped out the rest of humanity, the giant humanoid aliens that drove you beneath the surface, and memories of the young woman of whose DNA you are a clone.\n\n1000xResist doesn't have combat, but you'll find plenty of tense moments between cinematic turns and exploratory segments. As a recent winner of the Peabody Award for Interactive & Immersive Work and a nominee for the Nebula Award for Best Game Writing, it's an unforgettable journey nestled inside a largely narrative-led game, offering multiple endings depending on your moral choices.\n\nSet in the eponymous Louisiana town of Norco, this surreal Southern Gothic tale is perfectly pitched between cinematic narrative and immersive mystery. In our Norco review, we praised its \"beautiful, evocative, and contemplative storytelling\", presenting a rich dystopian world that pits corporate greed against the horrifying resilience of nature.\n\nStrange, terrible, and often funny encounters with an eclectic cast seem to link the lead character's mother's disappearance with the local oil refinery and a mysteriously omnipresent odd-jobs app. Tinged with grief and fear, the story knows when to ramp up the tension, and when to deliver an emotional blow. It's a beautifully crafted piece of storytelling and one of the best point-and-click games around.\n\n2024's Still Wakes the Deep is a masterfully told psychological horror set on a collapsing oil rig in the North Sea. The problems of an already fragile crew are elevated to the stuff of nightmares as a dredged up eldritch horror begins to tear their minds (and the precarious rig) apart. None of the crew have any superhuman skills, lead character Caz isn't particularly strong or brave himself, you'll not find any overpowered weapons here and – as we noted in our Still Wakes the Deep review – the odds feel like they're perpetually collapsing around you. All you can really do is hide and pray.\n\nIt's a claustrophobic fight to survive, squeezing through vents and pounding your way down flooding corridors, yet still the tender stories of those around you still break through in moments of melancholic relief. What makes Still Wakes the Deep stand out is its emphasis on the fact that you're not alone. Having no one to rely on is scary, but perhaps having people rely on you is worse.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Great Circle not only has a great story, but tells it by giving you the starring role in a movie. Through stealth sections, puzzles, platforming, and scrappy combat, this action adventure – featuring everyone's favourite behatted ophidiophobe – has a bit of everything. Set between the events of Raiders of the Lost Ark and those of The Last Crusade, The Great Circle tells a brand new story framed by familiar faces.\n\nThere's plenty of freedom to explore, outsmart enemies, and solve environmental riddles in a number of huge open-ended levels, making this a story you can tell in your own way. In our Indiana Jones and the Great Circle review, we were especially impressed by how the game captures the look, sound, and spirit of the movies, presenting a riveting story with an unexpected focus on stealth and freeform exploration.\n\nHarold Halibut's entire premise is the strength of the story and characters within. Playing it is akin to sitting down with a box-set series and watching it all in one go on a rainy Saturday afternoon. It's mostly a walking simulator, taking you through a beautiful story set on a crashed spaceship far out in the cosmos, where everyone is just trying to figure out a way back home.\n\nHarold Halibut invites us to connect with people and their perspectives with an open heart. Each character is richly realised, with hopes and dreams and fears all of their own, while – as we pointed out in our Harold Halibut review – the hand-made aesthetics of the game make each location feel alive and lived-in. As Buddy the in-game mailman would have it, \"each person aboard this ship is a world of their own.\"\n\nOld Skies is one of the best games to come out in 2025, a tale of love and loss with plenty of mystery holding it together. Wadjet Eye Games continue their long run of exceptionally good point-and-click adventures, with the gorgeous art, complex puzzles, and immersive voice acting we've come to expect.\n\nAs a professional time traveler, Fia Quinn is tasked with zipping between various eras of New York City at the whim of her wealthy clients, toeing the thin line between tiny historical tweaks and upsetting the balance of the entire future. In our review of Old Skies, we especially liked how the story surprises with its exploration into the negatives of not influencing the flow of time, of being someone that no one remembers, regardless of what you accomplish.\n\nIt might sound like a rogue choice to suggest a game that isn't quite finished, but the completed Chapters 1-4 of Deltarune are already enough to get excited about. Deltarune is funny, irreverent, and occasionally tragic, as well as being beautifully accommodating to both Undertale fans who can't get enough of Toby Fox's twisting, subversive narratives, and new players who want to see what all the fuss is about.\n\nDeltarune's Chapter 2 made GameSpot's Best of 2021 despite being half the size it is now, and we know the wait for Deltarune's next chapter won't be very long in comparison. The release of four chapters in one go has given fans plenty to dig into, whether it's the main story's themes of friendship and mercy, or the countless hidden easter eggs and secrets peppered throughout the varied worlds of each chapter.\n\nOne of the games recently brought to PlayStation as part of a wider Xbox strategy, Pentiment is a visually stunning point-and-click adventure with a twist. The character of Andreas Maler not only solves puzzles and problems as a tumultuous time of political unrest threatens a 16th century Alpine town, but also makes decisions that will come to affect the lives of those around him in unexpected ways.\n\nFilled with gorgeous artwork based on illustrated manuscripts and ancient religious works, the game uses fonts as an unconventional way to signify class and accents between characters. Minor details show such care and attention, and the overarching plot is both fascinating and emotionally wrought. The story of Pentiment is one you won't forget.\n\nThe Excavation of Hob's Barrow is a point-and-click adventure absolutely drenched in creepy folklore and dark magic. Arriving in the quaint English town of Bewlay to conduct some excavations, Thomasina Bateman soon finds herself thrown into a horrifying conspiracy that goes back centuries, tying her family and the townsfolk to an unimaginable evil.\n\nAlongside the story's folk horror themes are meditations on loss, family, and the fragility of memory. Lost in Cult have recently kicked off their new line of physical games with The Excavation of Hob's Barrow, featuring original artwork and an essay booklet, a testament to the game's poignant story and its impact on those who have played it.\n\nMetaphor: ReFantazio took the gaming world by storm when it first came out, but it's not too late to get stuck in. One of very few games in the history of Gamespot to earn a 10/10 review, and undoubtedly one of the best PC games to play in 2025, if you're looking for a game that ticks every box – gameplay, story, combat, art – you'll want to jump on this one.\n\nMetaphor: ReFantazio follows a young boy whose initial mission to deliver a letter evolves into a sprawling journey packed with giant monstrosities to battle and a world at war with itself. The game reaches deep into topics of politics, religion, and community, inviting the player to have frank conversations about the impact of each of these things on our wider world. Metaphor: ReFantazio really is a modern masterpiece.\n\nDespite its indie status, Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector is one of the biggest game releases of January 2025. Building on the success of 2022's Citizen Sleeper, the sequel is packed with character-rich storylines, beautifully-written dialogue, and moral challenges. The story starts in much the same way as the original, you awake as a sleeper (a sentient android housing a human mind) and have to find a way to stop your robot body malfunctioning and hide from the mercenaries coming after you.\n\nIt's a wonderfully-realised story that allows us to learn from our missteps as much as our triumphs, emphasising that the choices we make matter – especially when the odds are stacked against us.\n\nThe Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy is the brain child of directors Kazutaka Kodaka and Kotaro Uchikoshi, best known for the Danganronpa and Zero Escape series, respectively. Their team-up has resulted in a game that bears some resemblance to both those series, but blown up massively. The branching story of The Hundred Line - which follows a group of teenagers who find themselves locked into the titular academy for 100 days, told that it's their job to protect it from an invading alien force that's trying to wipe out humanity - features over 100 distinct endings. Unlocking all of them will take well over 100 hours. \n\nBut this is a list of the games with the best stories, not the most stories, and thankfully The Hundred Line's enormous script is thoroughly entertaining. Getting to know all the different characters across multiple scenarios and temporalities is a real treat, and many of the revelations you'll uncover while unlocking and exploring different story paths are hugely surprising. The turn-based strategy battles peppered throughout The Hundred Line are good fun too, but it's the twisty, strange storytelling that will keep you hooked.\n\nSilent Hill f is simultaneously both a departure from the usual Silent Hill formula, and yet deeply familiar. The game trades the series' usual American settings for 1960s Japan, where teenage girl Shimizu Hinako finds herself beset by a coterie of monsters shambling out of the series' familiar fog. Despite a new close-combat system and a very different environment, Silent Hill f carries the same eeriness and creeping tension as its predecessors.\n\nSilent Hill f is written by Ryukishi07, a Japanese writer best known for the When They Cry visual novel series. The story digs deep into some dark themes, including familial abuse and sexism; as you might expect from the Silent Hill series, there's a lot going on under the surface. There are five endings, and to get the whole story you'll have to finish the game multiple times, but persistence is rewarded with some of the best, smartest storytelling in any game released in 2025.\n\nManagement sims aren't known for their storylines, but Promise Mascot Agency has one of the best stories you could hope for if your jam is irreverent, chaotic, surreal Japanese mysteries. The game – from the makers of Paradise Killer – made our list of the best Steam Deck games to play in 2025, and for good reason.\n\nTaking on the role of an exiled Yakuza sent to a cursed town to make back the money he lost, you'll have to recruit sentient mascots to prop up your new business front. In amongst the everyday business management, there are individual stories of self-fulfillment to explore, the overarching murder mystery at the heart of your exile, and a range of activities to bring a once-prosperous town back into the limelight.\n\nDIspatch is the return of the episodic, choice-based narrative adventure games that developer Telltale Games popularized in the early 2010s. The whole series is available now, but players who jumped on the game at launch were able to experience a weekly drop of episodes, each one following the journey of former superhero Robert Robertson III in his new role as a superhero dispatcher.\n\nDispatch deepens its world and characters across its eight episodes, mixing the worlds of superpowered beings and office politics well. As you choose how Robert will respond to different situations, the story changes and adapts based on who you get close to, when you speak honestly, and how effectively you run your team. The sharp humor, clever twists on superhero storytelling, and fantastic animation make Dispatch feel like an excellent playable television show. The game has been successful enough that a second season is likely, and it's coming to Switch and Switch 2 soon, as well.\n\nDeveloper: Supergiant Games\nRelease Date: September 25, 2025\nPlatforms: PC, Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch\nGenre: Action roguelike \n\nSupergiant Games' second go around with the Greek pantheon yielded a rare GameSpot 10/10, and a large part of that is the game's incredible storytelling. In Hades 2 you play as Melinoe, sister of Hades protagonist Zagreus, who must face off against the titan Chronos after the time master seizes the throne from her father. The central tale of Melinoe's struggle is compelling, but what really elevates this game's storytelling is all the incidental conversations you'll encounter.\n\nThe gods bicker, fuss, and gossip with you, as do all the other characters you'll encounter, whose backstories slowly spill out over many meetings. The writing is witty and sharp, and the voice acting, across the board, is excellent, imbuing each character with depth (if not always a lot of nuance). It will take a long, long playtime with Hades 2 to run out of new unique interactions.",

    "description": "Rare recordings of E.E. Cummings, Mary Oliver and more offer a tour through literary history led by authors in their own words — and voices. Take a listen.",
    "fullText": "Tom Wolfe was a fast talker. Eudora Welty had a musical Southern drawl. Kurt Vonnegut’s jokes got belly laughs.\n\nEach of these authors once spoke to audiences at the 92nd Street Y Unterberg Poetry Center in New York City, which has hosted some of the most celebrated writers of the past several generations, from Isaac Asimov to Anaïs Nin and Kazuo Ishiguro to Margaret Atwood. Now, the Poetry Center has digitized audio recordings of its literary events stretching back to 1949 — hundreds of which have never been released before — in a collection that offers a glimpse into history and a taste of what the writers themselves were like in public.\n\nIn 1965, for example, the year before he became consultant in poetry to the Library of Congress, James Dickey complained that his 14-year-old son had acquired a taste for rock ’n’ roll and a transistor radio. The sound of electric guitars had taken over his house. He was joined onstage that night by the poet Theodore Weiss, but it could have been Truman Capote, Joseph Heller or Adrienne Rich, who also visited the Poetry Center over the years.\n\n“Historically, it’s been the premier place to read your work in public in the United States,” said Billy Collins, a former U.S. poet laureate, who has read at the Poetry Center many times. “Maybe short of the White House or Carnegie Hall — but most poets don’t get to Carnegie Hall no matter how hard they practice.”\n\nYou can listen to some clips from the archive below.\n\nBaldwin was a gifted public speaker, compelling and quick on his feet. The eldest son of a preacher, Baldwin turned his own oratorical skills to advocacy and debate after a short stint at the pulpit as a teenager. Here, he talks about the mysteries of the writing process.\n\nIn this recording, Didion reads from her book “The Year of Magical Thinking,” which recounts her daughter’s grave illness and the sudden death of her husband, John Gregory Dunne. Didion and Dunne had been married for 40 years when, after visiting their daughter at the hospital, Dunne collapsed at the dinner table from a heart attack. He was pronounced dead a few hours later. The book offers a portrait of both loss and the long marriage that preceded it.\n\nThe prolific and prizewinning poet reads “Wild Geese,” one of her most celebrated poems. Oliver, who died in 2019, read at the Poetry Center three times during her life. On each of those visits, she made sure to include this fan favorite.\n\nVonnegut was best known for his novels, including “Slaughterhouse-Five” and “Cat’s Cradle,” but because he was at the Poetry Center, he thought he should read some poems. How he met the moment was quintessential Vonnegut: genial and cheeky in equal measure.\n\nWolfe, an author and journalist, was known both for novels including “The Bonfire of the Vanities” and for the role he played in helping to create “New Journalism,” which employed novelistic techniques in nonfiction. Wolfe was also an exceptionally snappy dresser, and he was often photographed wearing a bespoke three-piece white suit — although he chose a different outfit for the reporting trip he recounts here.\n\nThe earliest recording in the collection is of the American poet E.E. Cummings, who read at the Poetry Center in 1949. Cummings was born in 1894 and died in 1962, so even readers who love his distinctive style — with its unusual, almost sculptural line breaks and formatting — may not be familiar with his stately reading voice.\n\nThis selection is pulled from a Q. and A. with the playwright behind such classics of American theater as “The Crucible” and “Death of a Salesman.” A member of the audience asked about Miller’s play “The American Clock,” which is set during the Great Depression and was first staged in 1980: was Miller, the audience member asked, expecting another economic calamity when he wrote it?\n\n“dying is fine,” from “The Complete Poems: 1904-1962,” by E.E.

    "description": "Outside the gym, Martha Stewart says she tries to stay active by walking, gardening, and working.",
    "fullText": "Fitness trends come and go, but at 84, Martha Stewart remains loyal to the workout routine she has followed for years.\n\n\"I've worked out ever since I can remember,\" Stewart told Women's Health in an interview published on Friday. Even outside the gym, she makes it a point to stay active.\n\n\"I walk a whole lot. I garden a whole lot. I go to work in New York [City] pretty much five days a week or do my traveling,\" she said.\n\nStewart said her go-to exercises haven't changed much.\n\n\"I might not be as energetic as I used to be, but I'm pretty good,\" she said. \"The amount of weights and things that I use are pretty much the same as they've always been, so I'm strong. I'm very strong.\"\n\nAt 6:30 a.m. on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Stewart heads into a mat and reformer Pilates session with her instructor. \"I do a very intense program, and it's nonstop for 45 minutes,\" she said.\n\nSince she regularly commutes into the city by car, Stewart says Pilates helps her stay loose and flexible. \"It also is very good for strengthening one's bones, keeping one limber, working with aches and pains, stretching out,\" she said.\n\nShe practices yoga too, though less frequently than Pilates.\n\n\"Pilates reminds me a little bit of yoga,\" she said. \"I end with yoga stretches on blocks at Pilates.\"\n\nHer Tuesday and Thursday mornings are reserved for 45 minutes of strength training with her trainer, using mostly dumbbells and machines.\n\nDespite her busy schedule, Stewart remains committed to her fitness. \"Even when I get home late at night, I still go and do my workout,\" she added.\n\nA key part of her wellness routine also involves drinking green juice every morning, made with fresh vegetables from her garden. \"That's a priority,\" she said.\n\nTo make the green juice, Stewart typically mixes spinach, cucumbers, parsley, celery, and mint, and sometimes adds ginger or half an orange, including the peel.\n\n\"I grow that [produce] year-round,\" she said. \"It's very important that they be grown in my own organic soil, and it makes delicious juice.\"\n\nIn 2023, Stewart told Business Insider that Pilates and green juice helped her prepare for her iconic Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue cover.\n\n\"If you have my green juice every day, you would just feel great all the time,\" she said.\n\nStewart is one of several Hollywood stars who believe wellness comes down to sticking with what works.\n\nSpeaking to People in January, Jane Fonda said her workout routine hasn't changed much over the years either.\n\n\"I essentially do everything I used to do, just slower,\" Fonda, now 88, said. \"I used to be a runner, but now I love walking. I love being outdoors in the woods, especially up and down hills.\"\n\nIn April, Helen Mirren told The Times that she still considers a 12-minute military workout developed by the Royal Canadian Air Force in the 1950s to be her go-to exercise.\n\nShe also encouraged those in their 50s and 60s to incorporate low-impact physical activities into their lives.\n\n\"It doesn't have to be joining a gym. It can be small changes like taking a short walk or practicing yoga, which I still enjoy,\" she said.",

    "fullText": "The world's largest technology companies are scrambling to manage a growing crisis affecting thousands of their employees on work visas, as new social media screening requirements trigger delays at US embassies and consulates worldwide.\n\nGoogle, Apple, Microsoft, and ServiceNow have all sent advisories to visa-holding employees in recent days, warning them against international travel and describing appointment delays stretching up to a year.\n\nThe memos, sent by immigration law firms representing these companies or by their internal legal teams, paint a picture of mounting uncertainty for foreign workers who form a critical part of the tech industry's workforce.\n\nThe warnings come as American embassies have postponed routine visa stamping appointments, leaving some employees already abroad unable to return to work in the US for extended periods.\n\nFor H-1B holders, the primary work visa used by tech companies, the situation creates a particularly difficult bind. If their visa stamp expires and they travel abroad, they must obtain a new stamp at a consulate before re-entering the US. With appointments now being rescheduled months into the future, what would typically be a routine trip home has become a potential career disruption lasting up to a year.\n\nOn Friday, a spokesperson for the Department of State told Business Insider it was now conducting \"online presence reviews for applicants.\" The department said it may move appointments as resources change, with applicants able to request expedited slots on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\"While in the past the emphasis may have been on processing cases quickly and reducing wait times, our embassies and consulates around the world, including in India, are now prioritizing thoroughly vetting each visa case above all else,\" the State Department spokesperson said. Appointments in Ireland and Vietnam have also been postponed, according to immigration firm Reddy Neumann Brown PC.\n\nBelow are the full texts of the internal memos sent to employees at these companies, obtained by Business Insider, which reveal how corporate America is responding to the visa processing slowdown.\n\nGoogle and Microsoft declined to comment, while Apple and ServiceNow did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nBelow is the text of a memo sent by Jack Chen, Microsoft's associate general counsel for immigration.\n\nBelow is the text of an email sent by Berry Appleman & Leiden LLP (BAL), the immigration firm that represents Google.\n\nBelow is the text of an email sent by Apple's immigration team.\n\nBelow is the text of an email sent by ServiceNow's Global Mobility Team.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "At a revised 984 feet, the new Turkish ship would approach the length range of the American Nimitz and Ford-class carriers.",
    "fullText": "Turkey announced on Saturday that the length of its coming first-ever aircraft carrier is now meant to be 300 meters, or roughly 984 feet, making the vessel one of the longest operated by NATO allies.\n\nThe country's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, highlighted the carrier's revised size as he spoke at an Istanbul shipyard about Turkey's naval construction industry.\n\nErdogan said work had already started on the new carrier, which he called an \"older brother\" to the TCG Anadolu, an amphibious assault ship operated by the Turkish navy that is 261 feet long.\n\nThe length of a warship doesn't necessarily translate into actual size, which is more accurately measured in tons of water displaced.\n\nHowever, a carrier's length can significantly influence the space available on its flight deck, with profound impacts on capabilities such as the number of aircraft that can be accommodated, runway length, and the type of catapult launch system or ramp used.\n\nWhen Turkey began unveiling details in late 2024 for its carrier — for now dubbed the MUGEM-class — the vessel was designed to displace 60,000 tons of water, with a length of 935 feet.\n\nOriginally announced plans said the carrier would accommodate up to 50 aircraft, including 20 stationed on the flight deck, with a crew of 800.\n\nIt's now approaching the length range of American carriers, which are the largest in the world. The USS Gerald R. Ford is 1,107 feet long and has a displacement of 100,000 tons at full load, while the older Nimitz-class carriers are roughly 1,092 feet long with a displacement of around 100,000 tons, too.\n\nThe Turkish ship's new length is also being pushed far past that of the UK's Queen Elizabeth-class ships, which are 932 feet long and displace roughly 80,000 tons, and France's Charles De Gaulle, a much older vessel that's 857 feet long and displaces about 42,500 tons.\n\nAlthough part of NATO, Turkey has long sought to achieve defense autonomy through its own military technology.\n\nThe new carrier was originally meant to feature a ski-jump ramp for aircraft takeoff, but is now expected to use a locally made catapult system. Turkey is unlikely to deploy vertical-takeoff F-35Bs on the ship, since it was removed from the fighter program by the US after purchasing Russian S-400s in 2019.\n\nAt the Saturday event, Erdogan also announced the commissioning of the TCG Hızırreis, the second of Turkey's Reis-class submarines, and highlighted a new uncrewed surface vessel called the ULAQ.\n\nTurkey maintains NATO's second-largest standing military, behind only the US in the number of active personnel.",

    "description": "An AI security researcher says companies lack the talent to handle AI security problems — and traditional cybersecurity teams aren't enough.",
    "fullText": "Companies may have cybersecurity teams in place, but many still aren't prepared for how AI systems actually fail, says an AI security researcher.\n\nSander Schulhoff, who wrote one of the earliest prompt engineering guides and focuses on AI system vulnerabilities, said on an episode of \"Lenny's Podcast\" published Sunday that many organizations lack the talent needed to understand and fix AI security risks.\n\nTraditional cybersecurity teams are trained to patch bugs and address known vulnerabilities, but AI doesn't behave that way.\n\n\"You can patch a bug, but you can't patch a brain,\" Schulhoff said, describing what he sees as a mismatch between how security teams think and how large language models fail.\n\n\"There's this disconnect about how AI works compared to classical cybersecurity,\" he added.\n\nThat gap shows up in real-world deployments. Cybersecurity professionals may review an AI system for technical flaws without asking: \"What if someone tricks the AI into doing something it shouldn't?\" said Schulhoff, who runs a prompt engineering platform and an AI red-teaming hackathon.\n\nUnlike traditional software, AI systems can be manipulated through language and indirect instructions, he added.\n\nSchulhoff said people with experience in both AI security and cybersecurity would know what to do if an AI model is tricked into generating malicious code. For example, they would run the code in a container and ensure the AI's output doesn't affect the rest of the system.\n\nThe intersection of AI security and traditional cybersecurity is where \"the security jobs of the future are,\" he added.\n\nSchulhoff also said that many AI security startups are pitching guardrails that don't offer real protection. Because AI systems can be manipulated in countless ways, claims that these tools can \"catch everything\" are misleading.\n\n\"That's a complete lie,\" he said, adding that there would be a market correction in which \"the revenue just completely dries up for these guardrails and automated red-teaming companies.\"\n\nAI security startups have been riding the wave of investor interest. Big Tech and venture capital firms have poured money into the space as companies rush to secure AI systems.\n\nIn March, Google bought cybersecurity startup Wiz for $32 billion, a deal aimed at strengthening its cloud security business.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai said AI was introducing \"new risks\" at a time when multi-cloud and hybrid setups are becoming more common.\n\n\"Against this backdrop, organizations are looking for cybersecurity solutions that improve cloud security and span multiple clouds,\" he added.\n\nBusiness Insider reported last year that growing security concerns around AI models have helped fuel a wave of startups pitching tools to monitor, test, and secure AI systems.",

    "fullText": "GREENBELT, Md. (AP) — A federal judge on Monday will hear arguments about whether Kilmar Abrego Garcia should be returned to immigration custody after being free for just over a week.\n\nAbrego Garcia, whose mistaken deportation to El Salvador has become a lightning rod for both sides of the immigration debate, had been in immigration detention since August. In that time, the government has said it planned to deport him to Uganda, Eswatini, Ghana and, most recently, Liberia. However, officials have made no effort to deport him to the one country he has agreed to go to — Costa Rica. U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, in Maryland, has even accused the government of misleading her by falsely claiming that Costa Rica was unwilling to take him.\n\nThe government's “persistent refusal to acknowledge Costa Rica as a viable removal option, their threats to send Abrego Garcia to African countries that never agreed to take him, and their misrepresentation to the Court that Liberia is now the only country available to Abrego Garcia, all reflect that whatever purpose was behind his detention, it was not for the ‘basic purpose’ of timely third-country removal,” she wrote.\n\nXinis’ Dec. 11 order that Abrego Garcia be released from immigration custody also concluded that the immigration judge who heard his case in 2019 had failed to issue an order of removal from the U.S., and he cannot be deported anywhere without a removal order.\n\nAbrego Garcia has an American wife and child and has lived in Maryland for years, but he immigrated to the U.S. illegally from El Salvador as a teenager. In 2019, an immigration judge granted him protection from being deported back to his home country, finding he faced danger there from a gang that had targeted his family. In March, he was mistakenly deported there anyway. U.S. officials resisted calls to bring him back until the Supreme Court weighed in. However, officials have said he cannot stay in the U.S. and have vowed to deport him to a third country.\n\nIn filings last week, government attorneys argued that, with or without a final order of removal, they are still working to deport Abrego Garcia, so they can legally detain him during the process.\n\n“If there is no final order of removal, immigration proceedings are ongoing, and Petitioner is subject to pre-final order detention,” they wrote.\n\nMeanwhile, Abrego Garcia's attorneys cited a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that “because immigration proceedings ‘are civil, not criminal’ detention must be ‘nonpunitive.’” They argued that in Abrego Garcia's case, detention is punitive because the government wants to be allowed to hold him indefinitely without a viable plan to deport him.\n\n“If immigration detention does not serve the legitimate purpose of effectuating reasonably foreseeable removal, it is punitive, potentially indefinite, and unconstitutional,” they wrote.",

The boat they'd been using for their trip had been scheduled to return at about sunset.\n\nThe pair went out in a 42-foot Freeman boat named \"Unstopp-A-Bull,\" according to Luis Garcia, the supervisor on watch for the Coast Guard sector in St. Petersburg. The Coast Guard found the boat floating upright in the Gulf about 70 miles off the coast of Naples, with no signs of the missing boaters.\n\nNow, one of the largest searches in Southwest Florida history is underway, with a large community effort behind it.\n\nHere's what we know so far, as of noon, Sunday, Dec. 21.\n\nAs of 10 a.m. Sunday, Dec. 21, Randall Spivey and Brandon Billmaier, the Florida boaters reported missing Dec. 19 after a fishing trip off the coast of Naples, had not been found, according to Billmaier's wife, Deborah.\n\n\"Updates after speaking with the U.S. Coast Guard this morning,\" Deborah Billmaier wrote in a Facebook post Sunday. \"The EPIRB (Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon) was unfortunately still on the boat. They were bottom fishing when the incident occurred (still not sure exactly what occurred.)\"\n\nThe post also mentioned that a couple of life jackets were not found on the boat, indicating that Spivey and Billmaier may be wearing them.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard Sector St. Petersburg posted news of the search on social media Saturday morning, Dec. 20.\n\nAccording to the Facebook post, air and surface crews from the agency and partner agencies U.S. Coast Guard Station Fort Myers Beach, U.S. Coast Guard Air Station Clearwater, U.S. Coast Guard Air Station Miami and Lee County Sheriff's Office are involved in the search.\n\n\"The search effort support features an 87-foot boat on water, 45-foot boat, 60-foot helicopter, 144 plane, 6130 Air Force from Patrick Air Force Base and an 144 continuing through the day (not sure if this is a boat or a plane),\" Deborah Billmaier wrote in her post the following morning.\n\nAn urgent marine broadcast has also been issued to all vessels in the area to help expand the search range, said Billmaier.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard coordinated one of the largest search parties in Southwest Florida history Sunday morning, Dec. 21, starting at first light, according to Deborah Billmaier, wife of Brandon, Billmaier. In her Facebook post, she asked those with capable vessels to help out.\n\nFlorida Rep. Peggy Gossett-Seidman shared the post on X.\n\nErin Shaw Harrel of Facebook group SWFL Boaters urged people Saturday to take to the water to search for the missing boaters, providing these coordinates for the search: 25-51.67N 083-12.16W.\n\nBrent Stokes, owner of Stokes Marine, also asked for volunteers to help search.\n\nAccording to Stokes, anyone willing to help with the search could call Tricia Spivey at 239-896-4099 or the U.S. Coast Guard at 727-322-4180.\n\nAttorney Randall Spivey, 57, and his 33-year-old nephew Brandon Billmaier were reported missing at about 9 p.m. Friday, Dec. 19.\n\nTricia Spivey reported her husband and nephew missing Friday night, said Luis Garcia, supervisor on watch for the Coast Guard sector in St. Petersburg. “They were going to fish about 102 miles offshore.”\n\nSpivey is a white male, 6’1”, 245lbs, with brown hair and brown eyes. He was last seen wearing khaki pants and a dark in color shirt, according to Lee County Sheriff's Office. Billmaier is a white male, 6’2”, 250lbs, with strawberry hair and brown eyes.\n\nThe pair went out in a 42-foot Freeman boat named \"Unstopp-A-Bull,\" Garcia said. The Coast Guard later found the boat floating upright in the Gulf about 70 miles off the coast of Naples, but no signs of the missing boaters.\n\nTricia Spivey says GPS coordinates from the boat's spot tracker led them to that location near Marco Island and Flamingo. That's where the search has been concentrated.\n\nThe Lee County Sheriff's Office requested the public's help in locating Spivey and Billmaier.\n\nIf anyone knows about the pair's whereabouts, they can call 911, if applicable, or call the sheriff's office at 477-1000.

    "description": "ChatGPT recommended one retirement strategy for 2026: Maximize Roth accounts before tax rates rise. Here's why this simple move could save thousands.",
    "fullText": "When it comes to retirement planning, everyone’s got an opinion. Financial advisors push complicated portfolios, bloggers swear by extreme savings and your neighbor won’t stop talking about their real estate investments.\n\nBe Aware: Major 401(k) Change Coming in 2026 — High Earners Must Act Now\n\nRead Next: 5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up To $1K Per Month From Home\n\nSo I decided to cut through the noise and ask ChatGPT directly: What’s the single smartest retirement move to make in 2026?\n\nThe answer was surprisingly straightforward — and it has everything to do with timing.\n\nChatGPT’s response was clear: Maximize your tax-advantaged accounts with a Roth-first strategy while tax rates are still relatively low.\n\nThat means prioritizing Roth IRA contributions, Roth 401(k) contributions and Roth conversions over traditional pretax retirement accounts. The reason this matters so much right now comes down to one major deadline.\n\nLearn More: This ‘Boring’ Investment Could Be the Secret To Never Running Out of Retirement Income\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisions expire after 2025. That means many Americans will face higher federal tax rates starting in 2026 and beyond.\n\nIf you convert money from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA before rates go up, you pay taxes at today’s lower rates. Then that money grows tax-free forever and you never pay taxes on it again — even when rates are higher.\n\nChatGPT explained that this creates a perfect opportunity. Lock in lower tax rates now by moving money into Roth accounts before the window closes. For people who expect to be in a similar or higher tax bracket in retirement, this move could save thousands of dollars over a lifetime.\n\nThe Roth-first strategy isn’t complicated, but it requires action in three areas.\n\nFirst, contribute to a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) instead of the traditional versions. If your income is too high for direct Roth IRA contributions, you can use the backdoor Roth strategy by contributing to a traditional IRA and immediately converting it.\n\nSecond, consider converting some of your existing traditional IRA money to a Roth. You’ll pay taxes on the conversion amount this year, but then that money grows tax-free. The key is converting when your income is lower or tax rates are favorable — which is exactly what 2025 and early 2026 represent before rates potentially rise.\n\nThird, if you have a 401(k) with Roth options, funnel as much as possible into the Roth side. For 2025, the 401(k) contribution limit is $23,000 for people under 50 and $30,500 for those 50 and older.",

    "fullText": "The rise of illegal off-roading throughout Rhode Island's management areas is reaching a boiling point for many local residents. As a result, some are urging officials to take immediate action to curb the problem before it causes irreparable harm to the region.\n\nAs ecoRI News reported, the use of all-terrain vehicles and dirt bikes inside state-managed lands, such as parks, forests, and wildlife refuges, is such a large issue that it has become impossible to ignore.\n\nRhode Island Department of Environmental Management spokesperson Evan LaCross reiterated that Rhode Island law prohibits all-terrain vehicles from operating inside management areas. LaCross notes that the DEM's Division of Law Enforcement has received around 1,660 reports of illegal off-roading in the last five years.\n\nHowever, Rhode Island residents say that nothing has stopped off-roaders. Andy Grover, an experienced hiker who enjoys exploring Rhode Island's scenic trails, described the growing concern with off-roading in these protected areas. According to Grover, the problem stems from a lack of enforcement.\n\n\"This stuff tends to be what happens when agencies are gutted,\" Grover said. \"The General Assembly needs to see that if they have the manpower, then you can say, 'Why aren't you patrolling?' Between the off-roading jetting through here and the logging, the forest is being destroyed.\"\n\nOff-roading in vulnerable management areas can cause untold damage to the landscape. Deep ruts left behind by all-terrain vehicles can lead to severe soil erosion and even habitat destruction for wildlife. Over time, this may disrupt vital ecosystems in the state.\n\nAn anonymous source shared two separate satellite images with ecoRI News that demonstrated just how prevalent the use of all-terrain vehicles has become throughout the region. The images revealed countless off-roading trails that not only affected Rhode Island, but neighboring Connecticut as well.\n\n\"Local officials are well aware of the activities that take place along these trails but short of patrolling them on a regular basis, there is not a lot they can do about it,\" the source wrote in an email sent to ecoRI News. \"A good part of these activities occur in the evenings and on weekends when there are very few RI DEM staff available.\"\n\nDo you think the government should ban gas-powered lawn tools?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Stocks rallied on Friday to cap a mixed week for the major averages in what served as the final full trading week of 2025.\n\nFor the week, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose about 0.4%, while the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell about 0.7% and the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) closed little changed.\n\nAll three major indexes will enter the final seven trading sessions of 2025 within 3% of their record highs.\n\nIn the week ahead, those investors still around during the holidays will turn their attention to the prospects of a \"Santa Claus rally,\" while a few pieces of economic data out on Tuesday will clean up some of the lagging data delayed as a result of the government shutdown.\n\nTuesday morning's read on consumer confidence from the Conference Board should be the key focus, with one of 2025's defining narratives centering on the K-shaped economy that has emerged among American shoppers.\n\nMarkets in the US will be open for half a day on Wednesday and closed on Thursday for Christmas. Many international markets will remain closed on Friday as well.\n\nAmerican consumers are heading into the holidays with a bit less joy than last year.\n\nWhile data from the University of Michigan released Friday showed a moderate uptick in consumer sentiment in December versus November, at 52.9 the index is 28.5% below last December's reading.\n\nSimilarly, housing sales ticked up for the third month in a row in November, but 2025 sales are looking likely to finish the year at a 25-year low, according to data from the National Association of Realtors.\n\n\"Consumers are loud and clear that they believe that the outlook for the economy has soured quite a bit since the beginning of the year,\" said Joanne Hsu, the director of the survey of consumers for the University of Michigan.\n\nWhile consumer spending has by and large held up throughout the back half of the year, according to Bank of America, US households in the upper third of incomes are driving more than half of that spending; around a quarter of households are living paycheck to paycheck.\n\n\"The ‘K-shaped’ economy makes for a fragmented consumer,\" said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial. \"The affluent are fine, if not thriving, while lower-income households struggle with high rent payments, rising delinquencies, and job uncertainty.\"\n\nPerhaps another reason why Thursday's inflation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics arrived as such a surprise.\n\nAt a 2.7% headline increase in prices over the last 12 months, the November reading came in significantly below expectations. The reading should give the Federal Reserve the vote of confidence it needs to cut rates again next year, building on a total 75 basis points' worth of cuts in 2025, said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank.",

    "description": "Jeffrey Epstein demanded that young girls show their school IDs to prove they were underage.",
    "fullText": "Jeffrey Epstein demanded that young girls show their school IDs to prove they were underage.\n\nMarina Lacerda, who was abused by Epstein from the age of 14, said the paedophile was “furious” when an 18-year-old was brought to him, immediately sending her away.\n\nMs Lacerda, now 37, was forced to recruit other victims, and told The Telegraph that Epstein instructed her to only present him with girls who had a student school ID.\n\nBrazilian-born Ms Lacerda said Epstein stopped abusing her when she was 16 or 17 because he thought she was too old and she was not bringing him girls who were young enough.\n\n“I did bring him somebody at the age of 18, and he booted her out... He just looked at her and knew she wasn’t the age of 14, 15, or 16. And he really, he was like, ‘Get the f--- out’... he was aggressive,” Ms Lacerda said.\n\n“He turned to me, and he was like, ‘I’m done.’ He’s like, ‘You need to start bringing me IDs when you bring girls here... I want school IDs.’”\n\nAfter the partial release of the Epstein files, Ms Lacerda accused the government of orchestrating a “cover-up” by redacting swathes of documents and failing to release everything it held to “protect” powerful men.\n\nThe US justice department released thousands of files on Friday and Saturday, but hundreds of pages were heavily redacted, and a huge tranche of documents is yet to be released.\n\nMs Lacerda’s testimony about being subjected to years of abuse was critical in securing the 2019 charges against the paedophile months before he died in jail.\n\nShe is referred to as “Minor-Victim 1” in the 2019 indictment and spoke publicly for the first time in September to call for the release of the Epstein files.\n\nShe said she had looked through some of the recently released files and saw notes about Epstein demanding to see girls’ IDs, information that appeared to be from her interview with the FBI in 2019, two months before Epstein’s arrest.\n\nOn Saturday, she also said the paedophile would “brag” to his powerful friends that he was being massaged by a “beautiful girl” while on a call, and make her say hello to them.\n\n“We did speak to a lot of people on the phone who were, you know, politicians, some were princes... [they] were very important people,” she told The Telegraph.\n\nHe would “make it clear that he knew everybody and he owned everybody... he manipulated us,” she said.\n\nAfter lying down for a massage, Epstein would ring his contacts to “talk business and would always bring up the fact like, ‘oh, you know, I have this nice, young, beautiful girl giving me a massage.’”\n\nHe would hand her the phone and tell her to “just say hello”, Ms Lacerda said. She would tell the men something like “Hey, how are you?” but would not discuss anything “deep”.\n\nMs Lacerda said Epstein never explicitly told the powerful men that she was underage.\n\nShe met one Hollywood star she had spoken to on the phone in person, but was not abused by them or anyone else, other than Epstein.\n\nMs Lacerda is one of a number of Epstein’s survivors who have been calling for the full release of the files, believing there is information about men in his orbit that has not been disclosed.\n\nOnly a fraction of the government’s files on the paedophile have been released, some of which have been heavily redacted, prompting bipartisan outcry about an alleged cover-up.\n\nAt least 16 files, including one photograph of Donald Trump, the US president, were also deleted from the justice department website after being published on Friday.\n\nIn Friday’s release, dozens of photographs of Bill Clinton, including one of the former US president topless in a hot tub, were published for the first time, as well as pictures showing Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor sprawled over the laps of five women with Ghislaine Maxwell grinning behind him at the Royal family’s Sandringham retreat.\n\n“There’s a reason why everything’s redacted,” Ms Lacerda said, adding that it was “100 per cent a total cover-up”.\n\n“It’s almost like a joke, right? Like, we have to look at it as it’s like, this has to be a comedy show. Like, why did you even put out all these files?”\n\nShe added: “Who are we really trying to protect? Are we protecting survivors, or are we protecting these powerful men?... We’re tired of it. It’s gotten to the point where, you know, we’ve protected these powerful men for a long time.”\n\nThere is no suggestion Mr Clinton has done anything wrong. The former president, who admits travelling on Epstein’s private plane, wrote in his memoir that he had “stopped contact” with Epstein before he was first arrested in 2005, for soliciting a child for prostitution.\n\nHe said that he always thought Epstein was “odd” but “had no inkling of the crimes he was committing”.\n\nMr Mountbatten-Windsor was ordered to leave Royal Lodge, his residence in Windsor, following weeks of scrutiny over his links to Epstein and Virginia Giuffre, his accuser. He has always denied the claims and any other wrongdoing.\n\nMs Lacerda met Epstein in 2002 when she was recruited by a friend, who did not give her details other than that she could make money massaging someone.\n\nMs Lacerda, a Brazilian immigrant, was sharing a single bedroom with her mother and sister at the time and saw it as an opportunity to support her family.\n\n“It got to the point where I think I got really desperate for money,” she said. However, she could not face working for him any more after being forced to recruit young girls.\n\nShe said: “I didn’t want to bring any more underage girls, being 17 and having some knowledge of what was really going on there.\n\n“You had no choice but to bring him somebody because he’s so persistent and just he wanted to have, you know, a new face, a new girl.”\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "description": "\"60 Minutes\" abruptly dropped a segment about Trump deportees sent to a megaprison in El Salvador Sunday — two hours before it was set to air.",
    "fullText": "“60 Minutes” abruptly pulled a segment Sunday on the Trump administration deporting hundreds of Venezuelan migrants to a megaprison in El Salvador, a stunning move that comes on the heels of President Donald Trump complaining that the CBS newsmagazine has “treated him far worse” under new management.\n\nFor days, CBS had been promoting Sunday’s segment, “Inside CECOT,” which promised to reveal “brutal and torturous conditions” inside El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center. Correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi had spoken to now released deportees, according to a Friday press release. But the segment was pulled Sunday evening, around two hours before it was to set to air.\n\n“The 60 Minutes report on ‘Inside CECOT’ will air in a future broadcast,” CBS told TheWrap in a statement. “We determined it needed additional reporting.”\n\nAlfonsi sent an indignant internal memo to colleagues saying that pulling the segment “is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.” The memo was immediately leaked.\n\nShe wrote: “If the standard for airing a story is that ‘the government must agree to be interviewed,’ then the government effectively gains control over the 60 Minutes broadcast. We go from an investigative powerhouse to a stenographer for the state.”\n\nHere is Sharyn Alfonsi’s email to her ‘60 Minutes’ colleagues in full: pic.twitter.com/ilGoSROQEs\n\n— Michael M. Grynbaum (@grynbaum) December 22, 2025\n\nAlfonsi said the segment had been screened and fact-checked by CBS lawyers and Standards and Practices. Editor-in-chief Bari Weiss, who watched it Friday, decided to hold it.\n\nWeiss responded on Sunday: “My job is to make sure that all stories we publish are the best they can be. Holding stories that aren’t ready for whatever reason—that they lack sufficient context, say, or that they are missing critical voices—happens every day in every newsroom. I look forward to airing this important piece when it’s ready.”\n\nBut the decision to pull such a heavily promoted and presumably hard-hitting segment on the Trump administration is sure to come under intense scrutiny given the president’s recent comments about “60 Minutes” and his relationship with David Ellison, who now runs CBS News-parent Paramount.\n\nSocial media exploded on Sunday night with criticism of Weiss, declaring that she had failed her own standard that she announced in ascending to the role of running CBS News, “to seek the truth and tell it plainly.”\n\n“If this decision is not reversed, if CBS News will only run a piece if WH comments, giving them veto power over journalism, any staff member w integrity will likely quit, bc it isn’t a news division anymore. It’s TASS,” said veteran reporter Bill Carter, referring to the Soviet-era news agency.\n\nIf this decision is not reversed, if CBS News will only run a piece if WH comments, giving them veto power over journalism, any staff member w integrity will likely quit, bc it isn't a news division anymore. It's TASS. https://t.co/RjjZNX7nHm\n\n— Bill Carter (@wjcarter) December 22, 2025\n\nBut “60 Minutes” has lately run afoul of Trump yet again. Earlier this month, after “60 Minutes” aired an interview with his former ally turned critic Marjorie Taylor Greene, Trump referenced the settlement in taking aim at ownership.\n\nLast week, Trump unloaded again, “For those people that think I am close with the new owners of CBS, please understand that ‘60 Minutes’ has treated me far worse since the so-called ‘takeover,’ than they have ever treated me before. If they are friends, I’d hate to see my enemies.”\n\nTrump sued CBS last year over how “60 Minutes” edited an interview with his then-2024 rival, Kamala Harris. The network initially dismissed Trump’s suit as “without merit” and vowed to “vigorously defend” itself. But CBS-parent Paramount settled with Trump for $16 million in July as the company was seeking FCC approval to merge with Ellison’s Skydance.\n\nSince the merger, Ellison appointed Weiss, the co-founder of the Free Press, to serve as editor-in-chief. Trump has praised Weiss in the past, as well as Ellison, who is now vying to takeover Warner Bros. Discovery, the parent company of CNN. Ellison’s father, billionaire Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, is a Trump supporter.\n\nTrump returned to “60 Minutes” last month for his first interview since the settlement. “I see good things happening in the news. I really do. And I think one of the best things to happen is this show and new ownership, CBS and new ownership,” Trump said. “I think it’s the greatest thing that’s happened in a long time to a free and open and good press.”\n\nWatch a teaser for the “60 Minutes” segment below:\n\nHere's the deleted trailer for the now-\"delayed\" segment. It's almost impressive how much damage Bari Weiss has done to CBS News in such a short period of time. \n\nSomeone quickly schedule a prime-time Town Hall with Alan Dershowitz to rectify the harm:pic.twitter.com/382gRG5Lgp https://t.co/3gHRKNES2y\n\n— Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) December 21, 2025\n\nThe post ‘60 Minutes’ Abruptly Pulls Segment on Trump Deportees Sent to El Salvador Megaprison appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Dec 22 (Reuters) - A revamp of China's electricity market is boosting the economics of storing power just as international demand surges, sparking a boom for the Chinese energy storage manufacturers that already dominate globally.\n\nChinese firms are on track for a 75% jump this year in global shipments of lithium-ion battery cells for energy storage, ​according to one estimate.\n\nThey have exported more than $65 billion worth of storage and electric-vehicle batteries this year, cementing their dominance in a sector vital to backing up wind and solar ‌and keeping power coursing through artificial-intelligence data centres.\n\nThe surge in sales is driven by data centres and renewables domestically, as well as by Chinese reforms and subsidies that are boosting general demand for energy storage. International demand is rising in tandem with the ‌surging growth in data centres, a need to back up Europe's ageing grid and China's burgeoning renewable energy business in the Middle East, analysts say.\n\n\"These leading energy storage cell makers, they have full orders. Many of them are basically working double shifts now to try and meet demand,\" said analyst Cosimo Ries at policy research firm Trivium China. The boom \"is one of the biggest surprises of the year, I think, in China's energy space.\"\n\nUBS last month raised its 2026 forecast for global battery-energy storage installations by 25%.\n\nThe International Energy Agency forecasts global investment in battery storage facilities will rise 16% this year to $66 billion. Much of that is ⁠set to be captured by Chinese firms because while Tesla is number ‌one in energy storage systems, China dominates production of the tiny cells inside them.\n\nAll of the six top global cell suppliers - Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd (CATL), HiTHIUM, EVE Energy, BYD, CALB and REPT BATTERO - are Chinese, according to a January-to-September ranking by consultancy Infolink. Of the top 10, only Japan's AESC is not from China.\n\nEVE's ‍energy storage sales volumes rose 35.51% in the first three quarters from the same period last year. REPT BATTERO's third-quarter shipments of all batteries set a record high. Top EV players CATL and BYD did not break out energy storage shipments through the third quarter. Storage has historically made up less of their revenue than automotive batteries and EVs, although the proportion is growing.\n\n\"Pairing solar with storage has effectively become the only solution for meeting U.S. AI ​data-centre power needs,\" UBS analyst Yishu Yan told a media briefing. \"U.S. AI data centre power demand is very robust, but power is the biggest bottleneck, and U.S. baseload power - gas, nuclear, thermal - they ‌won't grow much in the next five years.\"",

    "fullText": "A White House envoy said Sunday he held “productive and constructive” talks in Florida with Ukrainian and European representatives to end the nearly four-year war between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nPosting on social media, Steve Witkoff said the talks aimed at aligning on a shared strategic approach between Ukraine, the United States and Europe.\n\n“Our shared priority is to stop the killing, ensure guaranteed security, and create conditions for Ukraine’s recovery, stability, and long-term prosperity. Peace must be not only a cessation of hostilities, but also a dignified foundation for a stable future,\" U.S. President Donald Trump's envoy said.\n\nThe talks are part of the Trump administration’s monthslong push for peace. Trump has unleashed an extensive diplomatic push to end the war, but his efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands by Moscow and Kyiv. Putin has recently signaled he is digging in on his maximalist demands on Ukraine, as Moscow’s troops inch forward on the battlefield despite huge losses.\n\nWitkoff's assessment comes as negotiations have been proceeding with Russia as well. A Kremlin envoy said Saturday that the talks were pressing on “constructively” in Florida.\n\n“The discussions are proceeding constructively. They began earlier and will continue today, and will also continue tomorrow,” Kirill Dmitriev told reporters in Miami on Saturday. There were no immediate updates on the talks with Russia on Sunday.\n\nDmitriev met with Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported.\n\nFor Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram Sunday that diplomatic efforts were “moving forward quite quickly, and our team in Florida has been working with the American side.”\n\nThe Kremlin denied Sunday that trilateral talks involving Ukraine, Russia and the U.S. were under discussion, after Zelenskyy said Saturday that Washington had proposed the idea of three-way discussions.\n\n“At present, no one has seriously discussed this initiative, and to my knowledge it is not being prepared,” Russian President Vladimir Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov said, according to Russian state news agencies.\n\nUkrainian civilians moved to Russia\n\nIn Ukraine, the country’s human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets on Sunday accused Russian forces of forcibly removing about 50 Ukrainian civilians from the Ukrainian Sumy border region to Russian territory.\n\nWriting on Telegram, he said that Russian forces illegally detained the residents in the village of Hrabovske on Thursday, before moving them to Russia on Saturday.\n\nLubinets said he contacted Russia’s human rights commissioner, requesting information on the civilians’ whereabouts and conditions, and demanding their immediate return to Ukraine.\n\nThe French presidency on Sunday welcomed Putin’s willingness to speak with President Emmanuel Macron, saying it would decide how to proceed “in the coming days.”\n\n“As soon as the prospect of a ceasefire and peace negotiations becomes clearer, it becomes useful again to speak with Putin,” Macron’s office said in a statement. “It is welcome that the Kremlin publicly agrees to this approach.”\n\nThe statement came after reports that Putin was open to holding talks with the French president if there was mutual political will.\n\nEuropean Union leaders agreed on Friday to provide 90 billion euros ($106 billion) to Ukraine to meet its military and economic needs for the next two years, although they failed to bridge differences with Belgium that would have allowed them to use frozen Russian assets to raise the funds. Instead, they were borrowed from capital markets.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump has fueled new speculation about his health after an awkward descent on Air Force One’s stairs.\n\nA video of the 79-year-old president exiting the plane at Palm Beach International Airport on Saturday morning, posted by MAGA influencer Paul Villarreal, has drawn attention online for Trump’s odd hand movement and slow, careful descent.\n\nIn the video, Trump appears at the aircraft door and slaps his right leg three times with his right hand before heading down the stairs. He cautiously navigates the steps while gripping tightly onto the railing, taking about 18 seconds to reach the bottom of the short staircase.\n\nPresident Trump exited Air Force One tonight in West Palm Beach. He is headed to Mar-a-Lago.\n. pic.twitter.com/Z4vBY8qobw\n\n— Paul Villarreal (AKA Vince Manfeld) (@AureliusStoic1) December 20, 2025\n\nHe then plops into “The Beast,” the heavily armored presidential car, where he is seen drinking what appears to be a Diet Coke. Trump is spending Christmas at his Mar-a-Lago estate.\n\nCritics online were quick to note the president’s apparent frailty and peculiar leg-slapping.\n\n“Tapping that leg to make sure it works going down,” one X user commented.\n\nAnother wrote, “I wish he concentrated on the economy like he concentrated on going down those stairs.”\n\nOne person hypothesized about his hand motions, “It is not his leg he is touching, but he is trying to get life back into his hand.”\n\nThe elderly president’s supporters defended him, however, with many pointing out that Trump had just wrapped up a long day, including a rally in Rocky Mount, North Carolina.\n\nTrump—who was filmed stumbling on Air Force One’s stairs during a visit to New Jersey in June this year—has frequently spoken about being “very careful” about walking down stairs to avoid the perils of his predecessor, Joe Biden.\n\n“I’m very careful. You know, when I walk downstairs—like I’m on stairs like these stairs—I walk very slowly,“ Trump said while addressing the nation’s top generals in September.\n\nA few days later, he brought up the subject again while taking shots at Biden during a speech to Navy sailors.\n\n“We had a horrible, horrible president who had no clue what the hell was happening. The chances of him walking down those stairs successfully were not good,” he said. “And I have to be careful because one day I’m gonna probably fall.”\n\nThe commander-in-chief then revealed what he apparently tells himself while walking down stairs: “I always say, ‘Walk down the steps nice and slowly.’ You ever notice? I don’t have to bop down the stairs. ‘Walk nice and slowly.’”\n\nQuestions around Trump’s health have dogged him in his second term, particularly after he let slip that he had undergone an MRI scan in October.\n\nThe White House eventually said it was a “preventative” look at his heart and abdomen, a claim met with skepticism from medical experts who stressed that there was “nothing standard” about the scan.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",

Will you take the lump sum payment or the annuity payout?\n\nAccording to Mega Millions' website, those electing to take the annuity option get one immediate payment followed by 29 annual payments.

Jeff Landry to serve as the U.S. ‌special envoy to Greenland, the vast, semi-autonomous territory of Denmark that Trump has said the U.S. needs to take over.\n\n“Jeff understands how essential Greenland is to our National Security, and will strongly advance our Country’s Interests for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Allies, and indeed, the World,” Trump said in announcing the appointment.\n\nTrump during his presidential transition and in the early months of his return to the White House repeatedly called for U.S. jurisdiction over Greenland, and has not ruled out military force to take control of the mineral-rich, strategically located Arctic island.\n\nThe issue had drifted out of the headlines in recent months, but in August, Danish officials summoned the U.S. ambassador following a report that at least three people with connections to Trump had carried out covert influence operations in Greenland.\n\nEarlier this year, Vice President JD Vance visited a remote U.S. military base on the island and accused Denmark of underinvesting there.\n\nTrump has said that Greenland is crucial for U.S. security and hasn’t ruled out taking the island by military force, even though Denmark is a NATO ally of the U.S.\n\nLandry took office as governor in January 2024. His term ends in January 2028.\n\n“It's an honor to serve you in this volunteer position to make Greenland a part of the U.S.,” Landry wrote in a posting on X in which he thanked Trump for the appointment. He added, \"This in no way affects my position as Governor of Louisiana!”\n\nDenmark, a NATO ally of the U.S., and Greenland have said the island is not for sale and condemned reports of the U.S. gathering intelligence there. The U.S. push for Greenland is also opposed by Russia and much of Europe.\n\nThe Embassy of Denmark in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment about Landry's appointment.\n\nThe Danish Defense Intelligence Service said in a report earlier this month that the United States is using its economic power to “assert its will” and threaten military force against friend and foe alike.\n\nThe service, in its annual assessment, said Washington’s greater assertiveness under the Trump administration also comes as China and Russia seek to diminish Western, especially American, influence.\n\n\"The strategic importance of the Arctic is rising as the conflict between Russia and the West intensifies, and the growing security and strategic focus on the Arctic by the United States will further accelerate these developments,” the report said.",

    "description": "The story behind Wales-based Wunda Group, which designs and supplies energy-efficient underfloor heating systems.",
    "fullText": "When entrepreneurs Charles and Josephine Pugh rented a property with \"uncomfortable and uncontrollable\" underfloor heating (UFH), it sparked a move away from the made-to-order furniture world they had been invested in since the late 1970s.\n\nThe couple, who had founded British retailer Multiyork in 1978, set up Wunda Group in 2006 at the height of the 'green homes revolution' when barn conversions and self-builds were de rigueur.\n\nThe Pughs’ home heating issue had centred on underfloor screed — a level layer of concrete where piping has traditionally been embedded into — with pipe centres too far apart. With no controls, there was a slow response time to heat and the floor became too hot. The Pughs thought the existing systems were \"slow and antiquated\".\n\nMonmouthshire-based Wunda now designs and supplies energy-efficient UFH systems and has cut through to the DIY consumer at a time of rising energy bills. The company employs 90 staff and says it has booked over £10m in sales this year.\n\nThe heating firm is also a family affair. With Charles as CEO and Josephine CFO, their daughter Josephine is managing director, while grandson Sam Jump is currently head of business development.\n\nThe business took off in 2008 when Wunda reorientated as installers looked for kits and components after the self-build market collapsed.\n\nIn 2010, their former base near Chepstow was in an old chicken farm shed renovated to offices. The Pughs still visited trade shows and had come across one American exhibitor’s aluminum chip board panel with grooves, which was employed as a last fix in the build.\n\nThey pioneered a version with high-compressed polystyrene and put a sample down in the chicken shed, with a heat pump which moved outside thermal energy internally. The closer piping also meant it could be run at lower temperatures.\n\nJump, who was working in the warehouse at the time and previously led a team of outreachers offering membership, recalled: “Everyone was walking around in T-shirts during winter and the response rate was unreal, the heat pump was operating at the optimum flow temperature with a co-efficient performance.”\n\nHowever, their product was initially met with scepticism from installers unwilling to test new products. “Where most people think of UFH as this uncomfortable system, we now have a rapid response system and it warms up as fast as radiators, if not quicker.”\n\nA booming DIY industry, renovating homes or building extensions instead of moving, has helped boost Wunda’s profits.",

    "fullText": "Palantir (PLTR) trades at 552 times trailing earnings and 175 times forward earnings. Bank of America set a $255 price target.\n\nMichael Burry bought $9.2 million in Palantir put options at a $50 strike price expiring in 2027.\n\nPalantir maintains a 50% free cash flow margin with full-year FCF estimated at $2.1 billion.\n\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nMichael Burry has been butting heads with the bulls on Wall Street, specifically regarding Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR). The bulls have won big so far, and the price targets have gotten even bolder. On the other hand, most analysts are sitting on the fence with a \"Hold\" rating, with three analysts having \"Sell\" ratings on the stock. There are four \"Strong Buy\" ratings, with the highest price target at $255, from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).\n\nBurry believes PLTR stock may be on the cusp of an implosion, with his bearish thesis focusing on the sky-high valuation of the stock. PLTR stock trades at 156 times trailing sales and at 552 times trailing earnings. It still trades at 175 times next year's expected earnings, which is an unprecedented valuation that no other big tech stock has seen since the Dot Com era.\n\nThis may be old news by now, but it's worth a refresher before we get to the meat.\n\nBurry holds put options on approximately 5 million Palantir shares, with a notional value of around $912 million. This is the largest bearish bet in his portfolio and constitutes 66% of his reported holdings. The true amount involved is much lower. Burry himself posted on X, saying that he spent $9.2 million buying 50,000 put options on Palantir.\n\nThese options expire in 2027 at a strike price of $50. Burry is betting that PLTR stock will decline well below $50, allowing him to sell higher at the strike price when it expires.\n\nRegardless, this is a drop in the bucket compared to how much Burry's spending power. The notional value did lead to dramatic headlines and lured in comments from Palantir CEO Alex Karp, who called Burry \"batshit crazy\" during an interview.\n\nThe bulls' argument is essentially that Palantir is an extraordinary company that deserves an extraordinary valuation. It has managed to grow significantly after getting its foot in the door at any company/agency. What truly makes this growth special is that the company has a free cash flow margin of nearly 50%. For a company believed to be early on in its growth cycle, Palantir is truly exceptional.",

    "description": "A look at the Patriots’ game day roster for their Week 16 game on Sunday night.",
    "fullText": "With Robert Spillane sidelined throughout the game, the New England Patriots’ linebacker group had a disappointing outing last week versus the Buffalo Bills. The challenge will not be any easier for the position on Sunday night against the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nNot only will Spillane miss a second straight game because of an ankle injury, the Ravens feature one of the best run games in the NFL. Led by the two-headed monster of quarterback Lamar Jackson and running back Derrick Henry, they are entering Sunday as the league leaders in yards per carry (5.2).\n\nWith Spillane out, that means the task on stopping this potent an attack will fall on replacement starting duo Jack Gibbens and Christian Elliss. As head coach Mike Vrabel pointed out on Friday, however, they will not be the only one in the spotlight.\n\n“Everybody that goes to the game is going to play and have a role, and we ask everybody to prepare as starters,” Vrabel explained. “That’s something that’s important. And so, Gibby will start in there, and then different guys will play, packages and everything else.”\n\nNew England’s full game day roster against the Ravens looks as follows:\n\nQuarterback (2): Drake Maye (10), Joshua Dobbs (11)\n\nRunning back (4): Rhamondre Stevenson (38), TreVeyon Henderson (32), D’Ernest Johnson (34), Jack Westover (37 | FB/TE)\n\nWide receiver (5): Kayshon Boutte (9), Stefon Diggs (8), Mack Hollins (13), DeMario Douglas (3), Kyle Williams (18 | KR)\n\nTight end (2): Hunter Henry (85), Austin Hooper (81)\n\nOffensive tackle (3): Vederian Lowe (59 | LT), Morgan Moses (76 | RT), Thayer Munford Jr. (74)\n\nInterior offensive line (5): Jared Wilson (58 | LG), Garrett Bradbury (65 | C), Mike Onwenu (71 | RG), Ben Brown (77), Caedan Wallace (70)\n\nInterior defensive line (5): Christian Barmore (90), Khyiris Tonga (95 | FB), Cory Durden (94), Eric Gregory (55), Joshua Farmer (92)\n\nDefensive edge (5): Harold Landry III (2), K’Lavon Chaisson (44), Elijah Ponder (91), Anfernee Jennings (33), Bradyn Swinson (43)\n\nLinebacker (5): Jack Gibbens (51), Christian Elliss (53), Jahlani Tavai (48), Marte Mapu (15), Chad Muma (49)\n\nCornerback (5): Christian Gonzalez (0), Carlton Davis III (7), Marcus Jones (25 | PR), Charles Woods (22), Miles Battle (35)\n\nSafety (4): Jaylinn Hawkins (21), Craig Woodson (31), Dell Pettus (24), Brenden Schooler (41)\n\nSpecialists (3): Andy Borregales (36 | K), Bryce Baringer (17 | P/H), Julian Ashby (47 | LS)\n\nThe Patriots’ front seven is seeing some changes compared to last week. Not only is Chad Muma active as extra depth at linebacker and on special teams just five days after getting claimed off waivers from the Indianapolis Colts, two recent inactives are also up this week: Eric Gregory will provide additional depth at defensive tackle, while Bradyn Swinson should help on the edge.\n\nSwinson’s presence on the game day roster comes in light of starter Harold Landry being questionable with a knee injury. The fifth-round rookie has appeared in one game so far, playing 10 snaps in the kicking game but none on defense.\n\nInactives (5): QB3 Tommy DeVito (16), WR Efton Chism III (86), TE C.J. Dippre (82), OT Marcus Bryant (52), LB Robert Spillane (14)\n\nPractice squad (16): RB Jashaun Corbin (30), WR John Jiles (83), WR Jeremiah Webb (29), OL Sebastian Gutierrez (72), OL Andrew Rupcich (67), OL Brenden Jaimes (61), OL Mehki Butler (63), DT Jeremiah Pharms Jr. (98), DT Leonard Taylor III (93), DT Fabien Lovett Sr. (96), LB Amari Gainer (45), LB Otis Reese (54), CB Brandon Crossley (46), CB Kobee Minor (19), S Richie Grant (39), S John Saunders Jr. (23)\n\nPractice squad/exempt (1): TE Thomas Odukoya (88 | IPPP)\n\nPractice squad/injured (2): RB Craig Reynolds, LB Darius Harris\n\nReserve/injured (11): FB Brock Lampe, OT Yasir Durant, CB Marcellas Dial Jr., DT Jaquelin Roy, RB Lan Larison, RB Deneric Prince, DT Isaiah Iton, RB Antonio Gibson, DT Milton Williams, CB Alex Austin, OT Will Campbell, RB Terrell Jennings\n\nReserve/retired (1): OL Wes Schweitzer\n\nWith no players elevated from the practice squad, a total of five players were ruled out on Sunday. The list includes no surprises, with Spillane, who was deemed inactive ahead of the weekend already, as the only noteworthy absence.\n\nThe Patriots’ game against the Ravens will kick off at 8:20 p.m. ET at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore.",

    "fullText": "The Denver Broncos rolled into Week 16 against the Jacksonville Jaguars riding an 11-game win streak with visions of clinching the No. 1 seed in the AFC playoffs.\n\nThe Jaguars had other ideas. Sparked by another big game from quarterback Trevor Lawrence, the Jaguars steamrolled the vaunted Broncos' defense in Denver to secure a 34-20 win.\n\nWith the win, the Jaguars improve to 11-4 while turning the race for the No. 1 seed in the AFC into a five-team contest. The Broncos drop to 12-3, while the 11-4 Chargers, 11-4 Bills and 11-3 Patriots (ahead of Sunday night's game against the Ravens) all remain in the race for the first-round bye in the AFC playoff bracket.\n\nLawrence led the way while completing 23 of 36 passes for for 279 yards with 3 touchdowns and no interceptions. He added 20 yards and a fourth touchdown on the ground.\n\nThis, a week after Lawrence led a 48-20 romp over the Jets with 330 passing yards, 5 touchdowns and no turnovers. But that was against the Jets.\n\nSunday was against a Super Bowl-contending Broncos team with one of the best defenses in football. And if you weren't counting the Jaguars among Super Bowl contenders before, it's time to reconsider that stance.\n\nThe early portion of Sunday's contest was a back-and-forth affair that saw the Broncos tie the game at 17-17 early in the third quarter. But the tenor of the game took a dramatic shift on Jacksonville's first possession of the second half.\n\nSparked by a pair of big penalties, the Jaguars drove 75 yards for a touchdown. A roughing the passing penalty for bodyweight on a hit of Lawrence on first down moved the Jaguars across midfield and riled up the raucous Denver crowd.\n\nThen in the red zone on second down, the Broncos got flagged for pass interference in the end zone when Jahdae Barron grabbed Parker Washington's arm while the ball was in the air. This brought the home crowd into a frenzy.\n\nLawrence responded by running untouched into the end zone for 24-17 lead Jaguars lead.\n\nBack and forth we goooo@trevorlawrence | #JAXvsDEN on FOXpic.twitter.com/ySt0CgOLMW\n\n— Jacksonville Jaguars (@Jaguars) December 21, 2025\n\nThe Broncos had multiple chances to answer, but there was no Bo Nix magic in the second half this time.\n\nDenver punted after four plays on its ensuing possession. Following another Jaguars touchdown for a 31-17 lead, a botched handoff from Nix to Jaleel McLaughlin resulted in Denver's first turnover of the game. The Jaguars converted that fumble into a field goal for a 34-17 lead.\n\nThen with 8:08 remaining, Nix forced a sideline pass to Pat Bryant in tight coverage. Jarrian Jones was there for the interception to all but ice the Jacksonville win.\n\nBo Nix is intercepted by Jarrian Jones 👀\n\n📺 FOX pic.twitter.com/4pNMf0lkHU\n\n— FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) December 21, 2025\n\nFor the day, Nix completed 28 of 47 passes for 352 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception. He was credited with a lost fumble on the botched handoff in the third quarter. And the Jaguars finished the game with a 2-0 advantage in takeaways. Those turnovers ultimately tanked any hope of a Broncos comeback.\n\nEven with the loss, the Broncos maintain control of that No. 1 seed. Their 12-3 record remains alone atop the AFC. And they hold the tiebreaker over the Patriots if the Patriots win Sunday night.\n\nBut with two weeks remaining in the season, the race for that No. 1 seed is anything but settled. And the Chargers could still win the AFC West. The Broncos and Chargers will face off in Week 18, when the division title could be at stake.",

    "fullText": "Denver Broncos wide receiver Pat Bryant was carted off the field after taking a hard hit from Jacksonville Jaguars cornerback Montaric Brown on one of the final plays of Sunday's game at Empower Field at Mile High.\n\nBrown was initially penalized for the hit, but officials picked up the flag after the cornerback was deemed to have hit Bryant in the chest, not in the head. Players for both teams gathered around Bryant while he was on the ground. Denver quarterback Bo Nix slammed his helmet on the ground after the play.\n\nBryant was placed on a backboard and carted to the locker room with 31 seconds remaining. Nix then threw a short pass to running back Tyler Badie, who went down after two yards, sealing a 34-20 loss for the Broncos.\n\nBryant had five catches for 42 yards before suffering the injury.

    "fullText": "We are three months into the NBA season, and the two former superstars for Rutgers men’s basketball are proving why they were drafted high and are showing potential to dominate the league for years to come.\n\nAce Bailey, despite a slower start to the season, is playing his best basketball as of late. Bailey started the year by averaging 4.4 points per game in October. However, in the two months since then, Bailey has averaged 12.1 points in November and 11.5 points in December. He has already had three 20-point games and has all but three games in double-digit points in December. He has recorded several highlight-worthy shots, including the one below.\n\nBailey still has a lot of development to do to reach his maximum potential in the NBA. If his time so far is any indication, he is on an upward trajectory to reach that level. He was viewed as an all-around project when he was drafted by the Jazz. In particular, his field goal shooting percentage, defense, and rebounding still need a lot of work. Regardless, he has looked better and better with each passing game.\n\nHERE COMES ACE BAILEY ‼️\n\nTHE ROOK JUST ROCKED THE RIM IN UTAH.\n\nTap to watch: https://t.co/nnbneYnnKu pic.twitter.com/2bnTNCCWqB\n\nArguably, the more NBA-ready of the two when they declared for the draft, Dylan Harper has already demonstrated an ability to take over games, despite playing in the NBA for less than three whole months. Against Washington earlier in the month, Harper recorded 24 points and five rebounds in San Antonio’s dominating 119-94 win over the Wizards. This is not the first time this season he has recorded a similar stat line, as he has recorded games with 20 or more points and six or more rebounds two other times.\n\nHarper is averaging 48.2 percent on field goals, which is just above the average for NBA players, which has been 46.9 percent this season. However, this three-point percentage needs some work, as he is averaging 30.2 percent per game this season when the league average for three-point percentage per game is 35.8 percent.\n\nDylan Harper 24 Points, 5 Rebs, 3 Assists full highlight vs Wizards I 25-26 NBA Season pic.twitter.com/XfqF8sWvYR\n\n— Hoops Showtime (@HoopsShowtime12) December 19, 2025\n\nBoth have shown their ability to score so far in this league. Now they need to prove that they can be contributors in the other statistics. Those will likely start to click as they get more experience on an NBA court.\n\nRon Harper Jr. has spent most of his time this season on the Boston Celtics G League squad, the Maine Celtics. However, he has been called up to the main roster a few times, where he was largely used as a rotational piece due to injuries. Harper has seen action in four NBA games this season, seeing 20 minutes on the floor across all four. He has 8 points so far this season, with six of them coming in the Celtics game against the Memphis Grizzlies. He has three rebounds on the year as well, all of which came against Houston.",

    "fullText": "Toronto Blue Jays President and CEO Mark Shapiro believes the Boston Red Sox could be the team to beat.\n\nThe Red Sox made the playoffs last season and have been active this offseason, adding the likes of Sonny Gray and Johan Oviedo to round out their pitching staff.\n\nYet, Boston is still led by a young core that features the likes of Roman Anthony, Marcelo Mayer, and Cedanne Rafaela, while Garrett Crochet is the team’s ace. With that, Shapiro believes no team is better set up for the next five years than the Red Sox.\n\n“Boston is probably positioned as well as any team in all of Major League Baseball,” Shapiro said on MLB Network Radio on Sunday. “I don’t know if there is a team that is positioned for the next five years better than the Boston Red Sox with young talent and flexibility.”\n\nIt’s a bold take from the Blue Jays CEO, as the Red Sox are a division rival of Toronto, but Shapiro clearly likes what he sees from Boston.\n\nWith Shapiro expecting the Red Sox to be better, he knows the AL East will be a tough division to win this year.\n\n“We already knew Baltimore was going to be better than they were last year,” Shapiro added. “All you have to do is look at them in the second half. They clearly have gotten better with Taylor Ward, with Shane Baz, and others.\n\n“They’ve had a good offseason, and I don’t think they are done. The Yankees are clearly, you know, they are not done. Tampa is going to be better; they are never bad, they are going to be better.”\n\nAlthough Shapiro believes everyone in the AL East will be better, his comments about the Red Sox stand out.\n\nRed Sox Reportedly Swing Huge Trade For Three-Time All-Star",

    "title": "Instant reaction: Broncos’ defense fizzles out as Jaguars route Denver 34-20",
    "description": "The Denver Broncos had their 11-game winning streak come to an end with their 34-20 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars.",
    "fullText": "The Denver Broncos hosted the roaring Jacksonville Jaguars in their Week 16 matchup. A gridiron battle of two division leaders, this one was expected to be a close and hard-fought matchup. It turned out to be the opposite, with the Jaguars throttling the Broncos 34-20 and ending their 11-game winning streak. Here are some instant reactions and key takeaways from today’s game.\n\nPenalties, drops, and miscues plague Broncos’ offensive effort\n\nLast week against the Green Bay Packers, Bo Nix and the offense had one of their most complete games of the season. In order to defeat the Jaguars, they needed to replicate some of that success. Sadly, that was far from the case with only several good drives through sixty minutes of play.\n\nAfter struggling in the first quarter, they were able muster a quality scoring drive early on in the second quarter. A 15-yard fade to Courtland Sutton tied the game up. A few drives later, Wil Lutz was able to connect on a 54-yard field goal to give the Broncos a 10-7 lead—but that was short-lived with Denver being down 17-10 at halftime.\n\nDenver’s first drive of the second half couldn’t have gone any better. Rookie running back RJ Harvey broke a few tackles and dove for the pylon to cap off a 38-yard touchdown scamper that tied the game up at 17. It was an absolutely marvelous play by the second-round pick. After that? There wasn’t much to write home about.\n\nThree-and-outs and stalled drives were a theme for the Broncos thereafter. A failed handoff exchange between Nix and Jaleel McLaughlin late in the third quarter was the straw that broke the camel’s back with Denver already down 31-17. In the fourth quarter down 34-20, Nix threw an interception on fourth down that officially ended any hopes of a miracle comeback.\n\nPenalties, drops, turnovers, and miscues all played a culprit in the Broncos’ regression on offense against the Jaguars. Ther only bright spot on offense was Harvey’s performance. It was in a losing effort, but over 120 all-purpose yards and a touchdown is praiseworthy. The team will continue to need him to play at a high level in the final weeks of the season to help secure the division title and top seed in the AFC.\n\nJarrian Jones picks off Nix!\n\nJAXvsDEN on FOX/FOX Onehttps://t.co/HkKw7uXnxV pic.twitter.com/F9MjGz2RRZ\n\nDefense fails to show up in worst performance of the season\n\nThe Jaguars entered today’s contest averaging well over 30 points a game since their bye week. Both Trevor Lawrence and Travis Etienne were on hot streaks. It was a big task for the Broncos to slow them down. Unfortunately, they struggled all game long and had their worst performance of the year. It was ugly throughout four quarters.\n\nOne area of concern I had was how safety P.J. Locke would hold up in coverage. He surrendered a touchdown reception to tight end Brenton Strange in the second quarter—aided by a clear push off by Strange. However, he was also targeted often on the Jaguars’ scoring drive right before halftime and also in the second half. It’s clear that Brandon Jones’ presence in the backend of Denver’s secondary was sorely missed.\n\nOn top of that, Lawrence was able to light up the Broncos’ red zone defense. Entering today’s game, Denver’s red zone defense was best in the NFL in ‘25 and a huge strength. Today? They gave up four touchdowns in Jacksonville’s first four trips inside the 20. That’s certainly not a recipe for success. It was Murphy’s Law for the Broncos on defense this afternoon.\n\nMissed tackles, missed coverage assignments, and penalties hampered Denver’s ability to thwart Jacksonville’s offensive endeavors. The Jaguars were routinely able to create yards after the catch and blow past Broncos defenders. It’s been a long time since we have seen them play this poorly. But perhaps a wakeup call was eventually in order. It’s really not worth mentioning ‘elite’ and this defense in the same sentence any longer.\n\nAfter multiple weeks of showing concerning weaknesses, all of the Broncos’ biggest flaws were exposed today. With only two games remaining before the playoffs, the team doesn’t have long to correct them. If they can’t, their hopes of a strong postseason push may be in jeopardy. Defensive Coordinator Vance Joseph and his players have their work cut out for them.\n\nThis Bronco Defense is all kinds of out of sorts. \n\nBusting coverages, not setting edges, no QB player on obvious Zone Read situations. \n\nTrevor Lawrence & Liam Cohen continue to punch the bruise. \n\nThe Brandon Jones loss looms larger than I would have expected.\n\n— Coach Mike Sanford (@Coach_Sanford2) December 21, 2025\n\nDenver can’t let this loss linger. Recalibrate and beat the Chiefs on Christmas.\n\nAll good things come to an end. It’s been an awesome season for the Broncos, but their eleven-game winning streak is now over. Getting pummeled at home by the Jaguars wasn’t on the radar for me. I thought the Broncos would win in a close game.\n\nA huge credit to Jacksonville for being the better team today. They executed a great gameplan on both sides of the ball. They also delivered Denver their first loss at home since October of last season. That’s pretty wild when you think about it.\n\nThat being said, the Broncos can’t afford to dwell on this loss and let it linger. They need to shift gears quickly and be prepared to defeat the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium on Christmas. There usually isn’t a good way to spin a loss, but this sort of adversity might be important for the Broncos to experience before the postseason hits.\n\nIt can serve as a bit of a reality check for them. Moreover, it’s certainly a woeful performance where there will be ample tape to show what they need to correct and improve upon. The next two games are against division rivals. They are must-win games for Denver to win the AFC West and find a way to edge out the competition for that coveted first-round bye and homefield advantage that comes with the #1 seed.\n\nWill the Broncos be able to show some tenacity and resiliency over the next two weeks? I sure hope so. So much is at stake. Let’s hope they can finish off the season strong with back-to-back wins. Although it isn’t going to be easy, especially with Pat Bryant and Dre Greenlaw being injured late in today’s game.\n\nProbably a good time to note that the Broncos can lose today and still get the No. 1 seed with 2 wins.\n\nAnd also that every time they've won the SB they've had back-to-back December losses. (Not saying you want that here, because that means losing to a KC team w/ its No. 3 QB)\n\n— Andrew Mason (@MaseDenver) December 21, 2025",

    "fullText": "Things went from bad to worse for the Kansas City Chiefs at the quarterback position on Sunday against the Tennessee Titans.\n\nThe Chiefs had already taken a major blow as they lost starting quarterback and multi-time Super Bowl Champion Patrick Mahomes last week to a torn ACL in a loss to the Chargers that eliminated the team from playoff contention for the first time in over a decade. But just when Chiefs fans thought the tough times couldn't get much tougher, that is exactly what happened as backup quarterback Gardner Minshew left the game against the Titans due to injury.\n\nThe real kicker? Early reports indicate that Minshew also tore his ACL, becoming the second quarterback for the Chiefs to do so in two weeks – and forcing Kansas City into a position where they will have to finish their last two games without their top two quarterbacks.\n\nChiefs are concerned that QB Gardner Minshew tore his ACL, as @mattderrick also reported. There will be additional tests but Minshew could be the second Chiefs’ quarterback in two games to tear his ACL. pic.twitter.com/vDVoxOTGKb\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) December 21, 2025\n\nTo add insult to (literal) injury, the Chiefs would end up losing the game to the Titans 26-9, handing Tennessee just their third win of the season in the process. Kansas City dropped to 6-9 overall with the loss, further worsening an already disappointing season for the Chiefs which still features an upcoming game with the AFC West leader and potential top AFC playoff seed the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe Chiefs will now turn to third-string quarterback Chris Oladokun, who starred in college at South Florida, Samford, and South Dakota State before being drafted in the seventh round of the 2022 NFL Draft by the Steelers before eventually landing in Kansas City.\n\nHe entered Sunday's loss to the Chiefs following the injury to Minshew, and completed his first career pass on a touchdown to Travis Kelce. He would finish the game 11-of-16 with 111 passing yards and two carries for seven yards, but it was not enough to help the Chiefs to victory.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Touchdown Wire: Brutal QB luck continues for Chiefs with Gardner Minshew injury",

    "fullText": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Carolina Panthers rookie safety Lathan Ransom has experienced the dramatic highs and lows of playing in the NFL in his first season.\n\nOne week after a crucial penalty that led to a costly loss to the New Orleans Saints, Ransom redeemed himself on Sunday by intercepting Baker Mayfield with 42 seconds left to seal the Panthers' 23-20 win over the Buccaneers — allowing Carolina to vault into sole possession of first place in the NFC South.\n\n“I faced a lot of adversity, and I heard noise from everybody last week,” Ransom said. “... (But) that’s how you shake back.”\n\nRansom couldn't have felt much worse last week on the flight home from New Orleans after he was flagged for hitting sliding Saints quarterback Tyler Shough with 9 seconds left on a bang-bang play. Officials flagged Ransom for unnecessary roughness, and the 15-yard penalty turned a difficult 61-yard field goal attempt into a far more makable one from 46 yards.\n\nCharlie Smyth put it through the uprights to complete the Saints' 20-17 come-from-behind win.\n\nHad the Panthers defeated the Saints, they would have only needed to beat the Bucs on Sunday to clinch the NFC South and end a seven-year playoff drought. Instead, the loss left the Panthers on the outside of the playoff bubble.\n\nRansom said he was hard on himself.\n\nBut the fourth-draft pick from Ohio State decided early last week that instead of dwelling on the mistake he'd use it as motivation.\n\n“I understand that the game is not won or lost by one play, but people behind their phone are going to have their own opinions,” Ransom said. “I just heard all the noise — listened to it and used it as fuel for this game.”\n\nRansom leaned on the support last week of veteran defensive leaders such as Jaycee Horn, Derrick Brown and Mike Jackson, who shares the locker next to him.\n\nJackson and others advised to look ahead, not back and keeping playing at full speed.\n\n“He responded like a grown man should,\" Jackson said. “At the end of day, everyone was talking trash to him, like he shouldn't be in the game and this and that. And today he responded like he should be. I'll just say I'm proud of him. Because at the end of the day it's grown man football and he showed that.”\n\nPanthers coach Dave Canales greeted Ransom on the sideline with a huge hug after interception, and smiled as he spoke about the rookie after the game.\n\n“That’s a great story,” Canales said. “That’s fantastic and it’s just about belief and having confidence in our guys to be able to be studs about the things we need to work on and be studs about the different decisions that come up. I love that for Lathan — for him to be able to make the winning play, the biggest play of the game for us.”\n\nThe Panthers will need more big plays from Ransom and other young players if they hope to dethrone the Buccaneers, who have won the last four NFC South titles.\n\nCarolina can clinch the division with a win next week against Seattle and a Tampa Bay loss to Miami. But if the Bucs win, it will come down to a rematch in Week 18 for the division title.\n\n“I’ve learned a bunch throughout the season, especially from that first game,” Ransom said. “You’re going to learn. It’s a learning process. You’re playing with the best of the best. I learn more and more every game and I try to take those teachings into the next game.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

    "fullText": "Game result: The Texans beat the Raiders, 23-21, in Week 16. Houston improves to 10-5 on the year and stays at the No. 7 seed in the AFC Playoff picture. Houston remains a game behind the Jacksonville Jaguars in the AFC South, who moved to 11-4 with their win over the Denver Broncos on Week 16.\n\nThe Houston Texans are closing in on a playoff berth, but it will be at least another week before they will have a clinching scenario. The Texans host the Las Vegas Raiders in Week 16 and this is a game they absolutely cannot lose.\n\nThe Texans are 9-5 and have won six straight in a streak that has included wins over the Jaguars, Bills, Colts, and Chiefs. They beat the Cardinals 40-20 last week. The Texans face a Raiders squad that is 2-12 and has lost eight straight games. Last week, the Raiders were thumped by the Eagles 31-0 in Philly.\n\nHouston is a 14.5-point favorite, which is the biggest spread of Week 16.\n\nThe Texans are in second place in the division sitting one game back of the Jaguars. Houston and Jacksonville split their season series and the Texans have a half game lead for the divisional tiebreaker (4-1 vs. 3-1). The Jaguars are traveling to face the Broncos this weekend, so if they lose that but win their two remaining games, the tiebreaker would go to record in common games.\n\nMeanwhile, the Colts sit a game back of the Texans and still has one game left with them. Houston won the first game in Week 13. The Colts need to see the Texans lose in Week 16 or 17 to create a situation in which the Colts can finish ahead of them.\n\nThe Texans are in seventh place and hold the final wild card spot ahead of the 8-6 Colts and 7-7 Ravens. If the Texans win and the Colts lose, Houston would have a wild card clinching scenario in Week 17 when they travel to face the Chargers. The Texans enter Week 16 with a 98% chance of making the playoffs at The Athletic’s playoff simulator. Houston has a 58% chance of claiming a wild card berth and a 40% chance of winning the division.\n\nThe Raiders are a common opponent for the Texans and Jaguars. There is a very real chance the Texans and Jaguars finish tied and it common opponents. They are also a common opponent with the Chargers, but Houston and LA will have a head-to-head tiebreaker sorted out when they meet in Week 17.",

    "fullText": "GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Bijan Robinson gained 171 yards from scrimmage and had a touchdown catch, Kirk Cousins threw two TD passes and ran for a score, and the Atlanta Falcons held on to beat the Arizona Cardinals 26-19 on Sunday.\n\nThe Falcons (6-9) won for the second straight week, with both coming on the road.\n\nArizona's defense made a fourth-down stop at its own 40-yard line with 2:05 left, setting up a chance to tie the game or take the lead, but Atlanta's C.J. Henderson made a diving interception of Jacoby Brissett's pass with 1:30 remaining to seal it.\n\nRobinson had 92 yards receiving on seven catches, including a 13-yard touchdown, and added 76 yards rushing on 16 carries. The 23-year-old became the third player in franchise history to gain at least 2,000 yards from scrimmage in a season, joining Jamal Anderson (1998) and William Andrews (1981 and 1983).\n\nArizona (3-12) has lost seven straight and 12 of 13 since starting the season 2-0.\n\nThe Falcons pushed ahead 26-16 early in the fourth quarter when Cousins scored on a 1-yard run, which capped a 12-play, 66-yard drive. Arizona cut the deficit to 26-19 with 4:37 left on Chad Ryland's 34-yard field goal, taking advantage of Cousins' fumble at midfield.\n\nBrissett completed 16 of 31 passes for 203 yards with a touchdown and an interception. The veteran has a 1-9 record as the Cardinals' starter since taking over for the injured Kyler Murray in Week 6.\n\nArizona tight end Elijah Higgins had 91 yards receiving on seven catches.\n\nAtlanta rallied from an early 10-point deficit to tie the game at 16-all heading into halftime. Cousins hit Kyle Pitts for an 11-yard touchdown with 25 seconds left in the second quarter. Calais Campbell, Arizona's 39-year-old defensive end, blocked the extra-point attempt to keep the Falcons from taking the lead.\n\nArizona tried a 50-yard field goal to take the lead just before the break, but Ryland's kick was no good, bouncing off the right upright.\n\nRyland also missed a 44-yard attempt in the third quarter wide right.\n\nThe Cardinals took a 10-0 lead midway through the first quarter after Michael Wilson made a circus catch for a 32-yard touchdown. Falcons cornerback Cobee Bryant and Wilson tumbled into the end zone as they fought for possession and the ball bounced between them, eventually settling between Wilson's legs without hitting the ground.\n\nCardinals: CB Max Melton (heel), LT Paris Johnson Jr. (knee) and S Jalen Thompson (hamstring) were among six inactives. ... CB Garrett Williams (Achilles tendon) left in the first quarter and had to be carted off the field after the non-contact injury. ... Rookie DL Walter Nolen III (knee) was carted off in the third quarter. ... DL Josh Sweat (ankle) was hurt during the first quarter and initially returned, but was ruled out in the third quarter.\n\nFalcons: Host the Los Angeles Rams on Monday, Dec. 29.\n\nCardinals: At Cincinnati next Sunday.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

Oh, and the Eagles also beat the Commanders — which eliminated the Chargers’ opponent this week, the Dallas Cowboys, from playoff contention. And heading into Sunday, we could see some big shifts in the AFC playoff picture.\n\nThe Broncos entered the week with the possibility of clinching the top AFC seed on the table. They needed to beat the Jaguars, and they needed the Chargers to beat the Cowboys to make it happen. The Chargers pulled it off, but the Jaguars shocked the Broncos with a 34-20 win.\n\nBut the most important shift we could still see in Week 16 is the Chargers clinching a playoff spot. That will happen with a win over the Cowboys, a box the Chargers checked, plus either a Texans loss to the Raiders (didn’t happen, though the Raiders made it a game) or a Colts loss to the 49ers on Monday Night Football.\n\nHere’s where the Chargers stand after the late afternoon slate, and the win over the Cowboys.\n\nDenver Broncos 12-3 (clinched playoff berth)",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers have struggled from three-point range this season, shooting 34.3%, 25th in the NBA.\n\nIn a 15-point loss last night against the Clippers, the Lakers shot an abysmal 16% from three (6-for-38). With Rui Hachimura and Deandre Ayton sidelined, Jake LaRavia entered the starting lineup.\n\nAlthough the fourth-year forward posted a double-double with 12 points, 11 rebounds and six assists, he continues to struggle from beyond the arc.\n\nLaRavia shot 0-for-4 from deep in what has been an inefficient shooting season. His 30.5% from deep is a career-low, after averaging a career-high 42.3% from beyond the arc last season.\n\nFollowing the game, LaRavia spoke on his shooting struggles, expecting to get back on track soon.  “I know I’m a good shooter, everyone on the staff knows I’m a good shooter, everyone on the team knows I’m a good shooter,” LaRavia said. “At some point, I have to make shots. Obviously, been in a slump pretty much this entire season outside of that first stretch of games where I was making some. But they’ll drop.”\n\nFor Los Angeles, they'll need LaRavia to step up, especially if Luka Doncic is sidelined for an extended period. Even when Los Angeles is fully healthy, 34.3% from deep isn't a recipe for success in the modern NBA.\n\nIn addition to LaRavia, role players like Marcus Smart, Gabe Vincent and Dalton Knecht will be relied upon to knock down threes in support of Doncic, LeBron James and Austin Reaves.\n\nThe Lakers will return to action Tuesday against the Phoenix Suns.\n\nFormer NBA Champion reveals he nearly signed with the Lakers\n\nDylan Harper shares his thoughts after crushing NBA Cup defeat\n\nKnicks' Karl-Anthony Towns makes classy gesture after NBA Cup victory\n\nPat Riley nearly paired Dwayne Wade with Allen Iverson\n\nDanny Wolf's stock continues to rise\n\nMichael Porter Jr. is lighting it up in the month of December",

Jacksonville entered the week sitting at the top of the AFC South … but we did see some shakeups in the AFC playoff picture in Week 16 — and there may be more to come, including the Jaguars clinching the division.\n\nThe Broncos were also in position to clinch the AFC West with a win over the Jags, and a Chargers loss to the Cowboys, who were eliminated from NFC playoff contention with the Eagles’ win over the Commanders on Saturday and did lose to the Chargers on Sunday. Jacksonville played spoiler in an incredible road upset, blocking the Broncos’ path to the No. 1 seed in the AFC for now at least. The Broncos’ top-seed clinching scenario included the aforementioned Chargers loss that didn’t happen, plus a Patriots loss to the Ravens on Sunday Night Football (which seems possible at least) and a Bills loss to the Browns (which did not happen).\n\nThe Jaguars had two potential paths on Sunday to clinch the AFC South: A Texans loss to the Raiders (the Raiders kept it close, but ultimately added a ninth game to their losing streak) OR a Colts loss to the 49ers on Monday Night Football will solidify the Jags as the division winner. So we’ll see what happens when the Colts take on the 49ers on Monday.\n\nHere’s where things stand after the Jaguars’ massive win in Denver and the rest of the late afternoon slate of games. .\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nDenver Broncos 12-2 (clinched playoff berth)",

    "fullText": "ATLANTA (AP) — Trae Young is quickly returning to his All-Star form after missing 21 games with a knee injury.\n\nNow, the Atlanta Hawks can shift their focus to healing their ailing defense.\n\nThe Hawks ranked 22nd in scoring defense before Sunday's 152-150 loss to the Chicago Bulls in the NBA's highest-scoring game this season.\n\nThe Bulls had nine scorers in double figures, led by Matas Buzelis with 28 points. The Bulls' 152 points set a season high. They also set season highs with 41 assists, 57.6% field goal percentage and 47.6% 3-point shooting (20 of 42).\n\nYoung scored a season-high 35 points with nine assists. Jalen Johnson had 36 points with 11 rebounds and nine assists.\n\nThe Hawks also had Onyeka Okongwu score 23 points and Vit Krejci add 20. Young's encouraging showing and all the offense wasn't enough to overcome the leaky defense. The Bulls set another season high by scoring 83 points in the first half.\n\n“It’s kind of tough winning games when you give up 80 points in the first half,” Johnson said. “It’s kind of embarrassing in a sense. …. Hopefully we cut down on some of the things we’re doing.”\n\nThe Hawks (15-15) have lost three straight and seven of nine to fall back to .500.\n\nYoung started for the second time in three games after missing 21 games with a right MCL sprain.\n\n“I think everybody is excited to have Trae back,” Johnson said. “He’s been out for a while. ... The fact he’s found his rhythm already in his second game is a good sign.”\n\nCoach Quin Snyder said Young may need more time before he's ready to play back-to-back games.\n\nYoung logged 26 minutes against Chicago, which he said was his limit for his second game back.\n\n“I feel amazing,” Young said. “They did their job, put me right at 26 minutes. They weren’t allowing me to do any more. ... I feel great.”\n\nYoung led the NBA in assists last season and is a four-time All-Star. He scored only eight points in 20 minutes in his first game back, a 133-126 loss at Charlotte on Thursday night. He was back in his high-scoring form against Chicago but missed a last-second jumper that would have tied the game.\n\n“Those are shots that he makes,\" Snyder said. “You feel good about getting the ball in the right guy’s hands.”\n\nSnyder said the Hawks “had a lot of breakdowns in execution” on defense in the first half. The Bulls scored 69 points in the second half and made 54.3% of their shots from the field, but Snyder said his defense “did a better job with that in the second half as far as making them work hard.”\n\nYoung said the high-scoring pace was no surprise.\n\n“It’s how both teams play,” Young said. \"Both teams play fast. Teams are coming in here and playing fast against us. We’ve got to figure out how to stop a team that can only play fast.'\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

    "description": "Trevon Diggs has come clean about how his October concussion. He also acknowledges that he is uncertain if he'll stay on with the Cowboys in 2026.",
    "fullText": "After two months of rampant speculation and mysterious silence on the subject, Cowboys cornerback has finally given an explanation for how he got a concussion back in mid-October, an incident that kickstarted his latest string of eight missed games.\n\nHis version of events, however, may not do much to quiet the calls for Dallas to cut ties with him.\n\nThe two-time Pro Bowler himself acknowledged that Sunday's loss may have been his final game at AT&T Stadium in a Cowboys uniform.\n\nIn the days leading up to the 2025 home finale versus the Chargers, NFL insider Jane Slater reported that Diggs had shared with her how he got the concussion. She classified his explanation then as \"far less nefarious than some of the rumors\" that had been circulating online.\n\nAfter Sunday's 34-17 loss to Los Angeles, Slater shared- with Diggs's permission- that Diggs says he took a hit to the head while trying to install a TV from his ceiling. The pole mount, he said, fell on his head.\n\n\"I was trying to be a handyman,\" he reportedly told her.\n\nPer Slater, Diggs \"didn't think it was a big deal and didn't need to be addressed but speculation on the internet went way too far.\"\n\nSome of you wanted to know how Trevon Diggs got concussed. It was never that crazy but the lack of answers made it sound like it was. With his permission he shared and here’s the video of it.\n\nHe says a tv he was trying to install from the ceiling with the pole mount fell on his… pic.twitter.com/3ooFFZFWDb\n\n— Jane Slater (@SlaterNFL) December 21, 2025\n\nDiggs reportedly came to the Cowboys facility on Oct. 16 exhibiting concussion symptoms. He was declared out for the team's Week 7 contest versus Washington. The team moved him to injured reserve after that game, but reported the cause as a knee issue. He sat out longer than the mandated three games and was only elevated to the active roster this past Saturday, the final day of his evaluation window.\n\nDiggs and the Cowboys were at odds for some time over why he wasn't back in the lineup sooner. Diggs had been claiming that he was fully healthy and ready to return; owner Jerry Jones disputed that, based on what he had exhibited in practice. Head coach Brian Schottenheimer alluded to consistency issues that had more to do with Diggs's all-around behavior.\n\nNow pressed into service for the final three games due in large part to DaRon Bland's move to injured reserve, Diggs is faced with the possibility of being irreparably on the outs with the team that gave him a $97 million contract just two years ago.\n\n\"Yeah, possibly,\" he told reporters after the loss Sunday. \"If this is my last [home] game with the Cowboys, it's tough.\"\n\nDiggs got the start on Sunday in place of Bland. And while he was in on six tackles on the day, he was also notably the closest defender on a 25-yard second-quarter touchdown throw to Ladd McConkey and was repeatedly targeted by Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert, who threw for 300 yards and two touchdowns and finished with a spectacular passer rating of 132.8.\n\nDespite the rollercoaster of drama that has marked his difficult 2025 season, Diggs has said he wants to return to Dallas next year.\n\n\"After the season, I guess we'll figure it out.\"\n\nTodd is on X at @ToddBrock24f7.

    "fullText": "Despite a sloppy start, UConn men’s basketball moved to 2-0 in the Big East with a convincing road win over DePaul in Chicago. While the Huskies (12-1, 2-0 Big East) looked out of sorts in the first half without star guard Solo Ball, they snapped out of it just in time to cruise to a comfortable 72-54 win.\n\nBall was surprisingly listed as inactive, ruled out with a wrist injury suffered after a hard fall in the conference opener against Butler on Tuesday. With Ball out, Jaylin Stewart returned to the starting lineup.\n\nThe Huskies were entirely out of sorts early on, turning it over six times in the first eight minutes alone, leading to 12 DePaul points.\n\nThe home team led for most of the start of the first half, up by as much as eight with 10:54 to play after Layden Blocker capped off a 7-0 run with a layup to lead 15-7. But Silas Demary Jr. and Alex Karaban did everything in their power to keep things from getting too out of hand. Demary Jr. helped UConn punch back, scoring five-straight points as part of a 9-0 run to give the Huskies their first lead of the night.\n\nUConn would take the lead for good off a nifty reverse layup from Jaylin Stewart with 6:17 left to play, and Karaban and Demary helped stretch the lead to as much as five in the first half, combining for a 5-0 run in the final minutes before a Blocker buzzer beater cut the halftime lead to three.\n\nKaraban was a much-needed stabilizing force throughout the entire first 20 minutes, scoring 10 points on a perfect 6-6 shooting from the field. He scored five of UConn’s first seven points as the offense sputtered out of the gate, and stretched the floor effectively with two 3-pointers. Demary Jr. started out on pace for a shot at another triple-double with seven points, five assists, and six boards in just the first half alone.\n\nDespite only really being able to lean on those two and coughing up the ball 13 times for 16 Blue Demons points, UConn managed to lead 33-30 at the break after arguably its worst half of the season.\n\nThe Huskies looked revitalized after halftime and came out hot, scoring four quick points to go up seven. With the offense back on track, UConn rattled off a 12-2 run capped off with a Braylon Mulins jumper to lead 52-36 with 11:53 to play. The Huskies’ defense tightened the clamps on the Blue Demons in the second half, with DePaul scoring just eight points in the first 10 minutes of the final period.\n\nWith the defense humming and the offense back on track, UConn stretched the lead to as much as 17 after a putback from Tarris Reed Jr. made it 58-41 with just under eight minutes to play. The Blue Demons did make one last attempt to get back in it by cutting the lead to 10 with four minutes to play, but a Reed fadeaway jumper off the glass extended the lead back to 12.\n\nOn the next possession, Karaban walled up and altered a DePaul shot on the block, then found Mullins for a three on the next possession to put the game away for good. Mullins would hit one more three-pointer the next time down for the cherry on top and finished the night with eight points.\n\nKaraban led all scorers with 21 points, and added six rebounds, two assists, and a block. Reed Jr. posted his second double-double of the season with 14 points and 11 boards, and added four assists and three blocks. Demary Jr., who appeared to be under the weather, flirted with a triple-double and finished with 14 points, seven assists, eight rebounds, two blocks, and a steal.\n\nUConn now embarks on a 10-day break for the holidays, with the Huskies returning to action on New Year’s Eve with a road game against Xavier. Tip-off against the Musketeers is set for 5:00 p.m. ET, with the game set to be broadcast on NBC Sports and available to stream on Peacock.",

My hat goes off for the guys that put together all these years. “ That’s part of it,” said Reid. “We can learn from it, and we need to do that going forward.” Sometimes a good kick in the tail helps you there. Coaches and players.”\n\nAfter only one catch for six receiving yards in Week 16, tight end Travis Kelce recorded his 12th consecutive season with 800 receiving yards, tying Pro Football Hall of Fame wide receiver Jerry Rice for first all-time. The catch extended his reception streak to 189 straight games, which is the fifth-longest reception streak regardless of position.\n\n\"I appreciate Chris (Jones), (Nick) Bolton, Trey (Smith), Creed (Humohrey), those are guys who could very easily have taken a day off,” said Reid, “I appreciate the effort they put in.”\n\nBolton up the middle for the third down sack! pic.twitter.com/YBi43YKLzX\n\n— Kansas City Chiefs (@Chiefs) December 21, 2025\n\nBolton’s four solo tackles against the Titans moved him into sixth place for most solo tackles by a linebacker in Chiefs history, surpassing Marvcus Patton’s 348 and bringing his total to 352 solo tackles.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Chiefs HC Andy Reid praises the effort from veteran players in Week 16",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers' form in the second half of the season has been horrible, and the ending to the 23-20 loss to the Carolina Panthers perhaps perfectly encapsulates that.\n\nWith the Buccaneers at the Panthers' 42-yard line and just about in field goal range, facing a second-and-nine, the offense could have picked up a few yards and been in good shape.\n\nBut Baker Mayfield threw a game-ending interception. Mike Evans was the target, and when he got to the top of his route, he cut inside, Baker threw it outside, and the rest is history.\n\nHead coach Todd Bowles stated it looked like a simple miscommunication.\n\nYeah, unfortunately it was,\" Mayfield said. \"I was trying to find a lane to step through and make the throw to him, and he thought I was going to scramble, which, based on some of the scrambles earlier to that, you can't blame him.

    "description": "The Arizona Cardinals lost for the 12th time this season, falling by a score of 26-19 to the Atlanta Falcons in front of a thin home crowd at State Farm...",
    "fullText": "The Arizona Cardinals lost for the 12th time this season, falling by a score of 26-19 to the Atlanta Falcons in front of a thin home crowd at State Farm Stadium. Arizona’s overall effort was a mixed bag, but injuries truly began to pile up as a brutal season continued trending in a dismal direction. With two games remaining (one against a Los Angeles Rams team desperate to win the division), there’s little hope to see another game in the win column this season.\n\nArizona did finally play a close game for the first time in multiple weeks. Although it did come down to the final drive, it was another game that felt ugly, disjointed and tough to watch. While injuries have been pointed to as a culprit of this particularly poor season, Sunday’s bout of maladies may carry impact into 2026.\n\nThe Cardinals’ offense was able to run the ball better than most efforts this season. For what felt like the first time in many weeks, Arizona put up 100-plus yards on the ground. A combination of Michael Carter, Corey Kiner and Emari Demercado were finally able to find some running room, combining for 127 yards on 22 carries — a rate of just over 5.7 yards per carry.\n\nUnfortunately, the passing attack that has been quite lethal in terms of overall volume production was nearly silent. QB Jacoby Brissett struggled, managing to complete just 16 of his 31 passes for 203 yards and one score. There were some key drops, but Brissett’s accuracy felt erratic.\n\nTE trey McBride was held to just 27 yards on four receptions, and the Cardinals’ leading receiver was backup TE Elijah Higgins.\n\nDefensively, Arizona managed two turnovers. Their defensive front was able to get pressure on an immobile Kirk Cousins. DL Darius Robinson had an excellent game with seven tackles, a TFL, a pass defended and a fumble recovery. CB Will Johnson locked up Falcons WR Drake London one-on-one. In some ways, it might have been considered a mild bounce-back performance — if not for the fact that star RB Bijan Robinson collected 168 total yards and a touchdown.\n\nIt was the type of effort one can expect from a team that has now lost seven straight. While the final score was ultimately close, it never felt that the Cardinals — after holding a 16-10 lead late in the first half — had a chance to put together enough offense to stay ahead of Atlanta.\n\nBut the most brutal reality of Sunday’s game is a tough one to accept. In a game that meant nothing in terms of standings or the playoff picture, Arizona lost multiple high-level contributors to injury.\n\nOLB Josh Sweat was helped off the field with an ankle injury. C Hjalte Froholdt suffered an elbow injury. Even the ironclad Budda Baker had to exit the game for a concussion evaluation, though he did eventually return.\n\nBut two of the Cardinals’ biggest defensive contributors suffered more concerning injuries. CB Garrett Williams left the game after a non-contact incident, and was quickly ruled out with an achilles injury — words that ring ominous to his availability next season. And DL Walter Nolen III, who had not struggled with injuries in his football career prior to 2025, left on the cart, visibly emotional with a knee injury.\n\nIt’s one thing to lose games. In fact, many would likely prefer to see the Cardinals’ draft stock increase. But to watch some of the more promising players on this defense leave with injuries of the non-contact variety is, somehow, the only way to make this brutal season a worse experience for loyal Cardinals fans.",

The Jags were efficient on offense, moving the ball well against Denver's vaunted defense and cashing in against the league's best red-zone defense.\n\nTrevor Lawrence, coming off the best game of his career last week, had another gem on Sunday, completing 23 of 36 passes for 279 yards with three touchdowns. Parker Washington had 145 yards receiving on six catches, forcing several missed tackles throughout the contest.\n\nThe Broncos had their chances to respond to the big shots being delivered by the Jaguars, but two second-half turnovers by Bo Nix knocked the Broncos out.\n\nThe Jaguars continued their historically good play in the Mile High City and now have a winning record of 5-4 all-time there.

    "fullText": "The San Francisco 49ers are heading back to the postseason despite not suiting up yet in Week 16.\n\nTo clinch a playoff spot the 49ers needed the Pittsburgh Steelers to beat the Detroit Lions at Ford Field on Sunday. The seven-point underdog Steelers did San Francisco a favor by upsetting the Lions 29-24 while the 49ers sat in Indianapolis awaiting their Monday night showdown with the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nThe 49ers clinched thanks to the NFL's tiebreaking procedures.\n\nSan Francisco's maximum losses is seven, and Detroit on Sunday suffered their seventh defeat. The Lions are the only other team in the NFC that can reach 10 wins. At worst the 49ers could finished tied with the Lions at 10-7.\n\nSince they didn't play head-to-head this season, the tiebreaking procedure moves to best record in conference games. The Lions are 5-5 within the NFC while the 49ers are sitting at 8-2. With only two games left against NFC opponents, the 49ers have clinched a better conference record than Detroit.\n\nClinching a playoff spot doesn't mean the 49ers will be in cruise control the rest of the way, however. They can still earn the NFC's No. 1 seed and a first-round bye if they win their final three games against the Colts, Chicago Bears and Seattle Seahawks.\n\nA win over the Colts will clinch a top-six seed for the 49ers since the Green Bay Packers fell to the Chicago Bears on Saturday and dropped to 9-6-1, meaning their maximum number of wins would be 10, and one shy of the 11 the 49ers would reach with a win Monday night.\n\nThe 49ers and Colts are slated to kick off at 5:15pm Pacific Time on Monday.\n\nMore 49ers: Kyle Shanahan blames 49ers WR for not reaching $500,000 incentive yet\n\nThis article originally appeared on Niners Wire: San Francisco 49ers clinch playoff spot after Steelers upset Lions",

    "fullText": "The Detroit Lions' 2025 NFL playoff hopes were just crushed.\n\nNeeding a victory to virtually keep their postseason hopes alive, the Lions came up short at Ford Field on Sunday, Dec. 21, against the Pittsburgh Steelers, losing the Week 16 game, 29-24.\n\nThe Lions will be eliminated if the Packers win either of their final two games against the Baltimore Ravens or Minnesota Vikings.\n\nIt was an ugly and uninspired performance, especially with the season on the line, despite a late comeback effort.\n\nBIG STORY: Lions fan says DK Metcalf swung at him after he used star's full name\n\nThe Lions took a 10-3 lead on an impressive 20-yard touchdown catch from rookie Isaac TeSlaa with 1:55 left in the first half, but it was all down hill from there. The Steelers went 80 yards and scored on a miracle TD with two seconds left before the break when running back Kenneth Gainwell made an impressive catch through contact, fell down but wasn't touched by linebacker Alex Anzalone and ran into the end zone to tie the game.\n\nThe momentum carried into the third quarter. The Lions ran just three plays in the period, tied for the fewest in a quarter for any team this season, according to the CBS broadcast, and one of those plays was a safety when Goff took a sack in the end zone.\n\nThe Lions were dominated in nearly every facet, particularly in the second half, but the real difference was on the ground. The Steelers rushed for 230 yards and broke two 45-yard TD runs in the fourth quarter, while the Lions rushed for just 15 yards.\n\nOutside of the massive playoff implications, one of the biggest stories of the day took place in the stands. Steelers star wide receiver DK Metcalf got into an altercation with a Lions fan who was leaning over the ledge to talk with him and Metcalf took a swing at him.\n\nMetcalf was not ejected from the game as officials did not see the play and thus couldn't throw a flag, meaning he couldn't be thrown out.\n\n“There was no flag on the field, so New York cannot weigh in with regard to a potential disqualification,” the NFL said in a statement.\n\nMetcalf had a quiet day, finishing with four catches for just 42 yards.\n\nDave Birkett covers the Lions for the Detroit Free Press.

    "description": "To prevent ramming attacks at Christmas markets, German officials have installed concrete blocks, chain barriers and, in one case, metal bollards removed by a hand-cranked crane.",
    "fullText": "Reporting from the Christmas market in Augsburg, Germany.\n\nFor as long as anyone can remember, the highlight of the annual Christmas market in Augsburg, a wealthy 2,000-year-old city in southern Germany, was the magnificent Christmas tree at the market’s center.\n\nThis year, the most popular attractions are the removable security bollards at the market’s edge, newly installed to prevent cars ramming into the holiday crowds.\n\nOn a recent December afternoon, half a dozen captivated bystanders stood around three of these mundane-looking posts. Wielding their cellphones, most of them were filming municipal employees as they used a hand-cranked crane to remove the 770-pound bollards every time a tram needed to pass through. During rush hour, that involved removing the bollards roughly once a minute.\n\n“These things are terrible,” said Hannelore Hendrick, 67, a rare bystander who did not take out her phone. “They remind me of the dangers of being here.”\n\nFor centuries, Christmas markets have appeared in town squares across Germany during Advent, bringing a sense of community, tradition and seasonal cheer to the darkest days of the central European year. Augsburg’s Christmas market has been held in the city for more than half a millennium, with the only documented breaks occurring during World War II and the coronavirus pandemic. Revelers can buy mulled wine, steak buns and Christmas decorations from brightly decorated wooden kiosks.\n\nThis year, the carefree spirit of the country’s roughly 3,200 Christmas markets has been somewhat dimmed. Security at these markets has been a national concern since 2016, when a man steered a stolen truck into crowds in Berlin. Ever since, municipal officials across Germany have tried to prevent further attacks by encircling markets with barriers.\n\nNow, officials are taking things a step further after another attack last December in Magdeburg, eastern Germany, which highlighted a flaw in the existing security measures. A man plowed a rented S.U.V. into the crowds there, killing six and injuring hundreds, after squeezing the car through a narrow gap in the barriers that had been left open for emergency vehicles. To fix that problem 12 months later, the authorities in various cities have blocked such gaps with police vans, metal gates and concrete blocks.\n\nAugsburg, where trams run through the protected zone, is unique in installing bollards that need to be moved hundreds of times a day. The contraption is so unwieldy that it has become a national symbol of the new security environment, attracting attention across Germany.\n\nThe mechanism first became famous through social media in late November, prompting coverage from the national news networks. Eventually, a well-known televised comedy show made a segment about it, leading to the charge that the city might be overdoing it, or doing it wrong.\n\nAugsburg’s mayor, Eva Weber, insists that securing the market is worth a few late-night quips.\n\n“It’s better for people to laugh at Augsburg than for people to cry with Augsburg,” she said in an interview.\n\nOn a recent visit, I found the security crews hard at work, at one point moving the crane roughly once a minute, attaching the bollard to a hook, whirling the crane’s handles to lift the bollard, and then pushing the whole contraption out of the way of waiting trams.\n\nOnce each tram passed, the workers reversed the whole procedure — to the amusement of a small crowd of onlookers.\n\n“At least they don’t need to go the gym,” said Elke Noll, 58, smiling at the physical effort required to make it work.\n\nComic though the system was, no one I met was opposed to its installation. Reinhold Hohenögger, 59, who has sold metal signs at the market for a decade, said that many of his friends no longer come there for fear of attacks. Lena Beuerle, 23, who was drinking mulled wine with her friends, said that while they can still get into the Christmas spirit, they have become more vigilant as they move through the market.\n\nA national poll last month found that 62 percent of respondents were at least somewhat worried about attacks on Christmas markets; only 35 percent said they weren’t worried at all.\n\nThe city is spending roughly 50,000 euros, or $58,000, to secure the Christmas market, according to Ms. Weber, the mayor. That cost includes the wages of a six-person crew that staffs two sets of bollards and cranes for more than 60 hours a week. And it is a small fraction of the estimated million euros that the little market earns each year, she said.\n\n“It would be reckless not to consider how large events can be protected,” said Ms. Weber.\n\nThough the barriers have their critics, some vendors at the market think the eccentric system has helped to attract more visitors to the market. “We are definitely getting more people than last year — and it’s not just Germans but people coming from abroad too,” said Sina Hefele, 21, who sells Christmas-tree-shaped ornaments at a booth a few yards away from the bollards.\n\n“If you want people to come,” said Mr. Hohenögger, the seller of metal signs, “you have to show them that you have thought about security measures.”",

    "fullText": "400-Mile-Long Fog Blankets California For Weeks\n\nPretty much everyone feels like they see endless gray skies in winter, but California’s Central Valley is taking things a step further with three weeks of foggy conditions from a phenomenon called \"tule fog.\"\n\nSatellite imagery from NASA and CIRA has revealed how pervasive the fog has been for the region, with day-after-day and week-after-week fogginess never letting up.\n\nThe fog started to develop on Nov. 22 and was firmly in place by Nov. 24 — and it's pretty much been there ever since (though it has grown and shrunk a little on a day-to-day basis).\n\nSoil in the Central Valley has been nice and moist following a rainy autumn.\n\nIn fact, precipitation totals from September through November ranked among the top 10% wettest on record for most of central and southern California. Modesto and Hanford, California, each broke the record for the wettest meteorological fall since records began.\n\nSo we have moist air for the equation.\n\nIn late November, a stable high-pressure system developed over California, helping to trap all of that moisture.\n\nThe fog layer has kept things cool in the valley as the rest of the Southwest has been basking in above-average temperatures.\n\nNow we have our temperature inversion.\n\nIs the end coming soon? Until a storm comes in to clear out the moist air, there's no anticipated end to the foggy conditions. The National Weather Service in Hanford, California, is warning of fog at least through Friday of this week.\n\nSara Tonks is a content meteorologist with weather.com and has a bachelor’s and a master’s degree from Georgia Tech in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences along with a master’s degree from Unity Environmental University in Marine Science.",

    "fullText": "With street lights out and wireless data limited, the Waymo vehicles were causing backups across the city.\n\nWith street lights out and wireless data limited, the Waymo vehicles were causing backups across the city.\n\nA power outage struck San Francisco on Saturday that blacked out about 130,000 customers at its peak, according to Pacific Gas and Electric Company, but also caused another problem: stranded Waymo vehicles. Posts all over social media showed the company’s autonomous SUVs sitting still in the streets and causing traffic jams.\n\nSome people posted videos of Teslas using their FSD feature to navigate the same streets, and Elon Musk tweeted that “Tesla Robotaxis were unaffected by the SF power outage.”\n\nIn response to an inquiry from The Verge, Waymo spokesperson Suzanne Philion sent a statement saying, “We have temporarily suspended our ride-hailing services given the broad power outage in San Francisco. We are focused on keeping our riders safe and ensuring emergency personnel have the clear access they need to do their work.” PG&E reported as of 7AM PT that “Crews have restored about 110,000 customers and PG&E continues to work on restoring the remaining 21,000 customers, primarily in the Presidio, Richmond District, Golden Gate Park and small areas of downtown San Francisco,” as it continued repairs after a fire at a five-story power substation.\n\nExactly why the cars weren’t moving remains unclear, with no public updates we could find on the company’s social media channels, but speculation centered on spotty wireless data connections, with cell towers either down or overloaded by people who no longer had access to Wi-Fi, and/or the street lights that weren’t operating without power.\n\nThese problems have occurred before, though, as seen in TikTok videos from earlier this year showing Waymos frozen by a malfunctioning street light and during a power outage in Austin, Texas. In a reply to a Reddit post showing another similar situation last year, someone saying they were a former employee commented explaining that the vehicle would send a request to a remote assistant and wait for their response before proceeding.\n\nAccording to a company blog post, it reaches out to a human response agent when the car encounters “unique interactions,” providing them with live and recorded views from its cameras in addition to a 3D map of what the sensors are picking up. However, those may require bandwidth that’s hard to find during a significant power outage. I couldn’t find any statistics on how many remote assistance operators Waymo has available at a given time, but in November, the company announced it passed a third-party audit by Tüv Süd, a German tech inspection company that evaluated its remote assistance program against industry best practices.",

    "description": "From Denny's breakfasts to hotel gift exchanges, we turned my pilot husband's flight schedule into creative, meaningful holiday memories.",
    "fullText": "There is so much pressure on women to make the holidays perfect for everyone. I had to accept the fact that I was unable to provide the consistent traditions that I enjoyed as a child. Instead, I learned to create memories while my pilot husband flew during the holidays.\n\nWith my husband's flight schedule, holidays never looked traditional or perfectly planned. There were tears, and some years were harder than others. As hard as some of those years were, they became the memories we still talk about and cherish today.\n\nI grew up with consistent holiday traditions. My grandparents visited on Christmas Eve. We ate together, opened gifts, and my great-grandmother played the piano. I would struggle to sleep, but I would wake up to gifts with my parents and my brother. After the chaos of gift opening, we would take a drive to see my other grandparents and eat, and then open presents. Like clockwork, I knew what to expect every year.\n\nI knew my husband would work holidays when we married. Living with that reality was more difficult than I expected. I missed the comfort of my childhood traditions. I felt sad that my kids wouldn't share those same experiences. My dream of creating consistent family traditions was not going to happen. I could fight it and cry, or I could find ways to make the holidays fun and meaningful, no matter the date on the calendar.\n\nOne Christmas, while he was flying, the kids and I spent Christmas morning at a Denny's coloring. We colored pages for my grandmother, who was living in an assisted living facility. We packed our artwork and picked up some holiday treats from home. Then, we drove over for a surprise visit on Christmas morning. We had already opened gifts with her, but this was a special visit. My grandfather had passed, and she was alone. Her memory was fading, and she spent a lot of time in her little apartment. Her face lit up when we walked into the room. We spent the morning looking through old photos. She hung up the pictures the kids had brought over, and we walked around the facility saying hi to the residents. Spending Christmas morning with her is a memory that I'll cherish forever.\n\nThat Christmas morning at Denny's, I saw it for the first time. This wasn't about loss or compromise. Every year, my kids experienced something new and special. This was different from my traditional upbringing. That one Christmas morning with my grandmother, I saw the opportunity. The opportunity to provide my kids with something different and unique every year.\n\nThe following year, his schedule was even worse. He was flying over Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and even a few days after Christmas. That year was tough to prepare for. We decided to celebrate Christmas on the 28th. This was tough. Kids count down to a specific date all year, only to hear that they have to wait even longer. By a stroke of luck, he had a schedule change and was able to drive home, and we woke the kids up at midnight. We opened gifts, laughed, ate treats, and went back to bed. The next morning, he drove back to the airport for his Christmas Day flight.\n\nAs the kids got older, we would anxiously wait for his schedule so that we could plan our Christmas. One year, we took a last-minute cruise, came home to open gifts, and then saw him off for his Christmas Day flights.\n\nOne year, his overnight was close enough that we were able to load up some presents and drive to his hotel. We spent the day as a family. We saw a movie, ate at a restaurant, opened presents, and then the kids and I drove home.\n\nThis holiday season will be the last with my husband flying, as he retires next year. Even though he will now be home, we will always have a unique way of celebrating.",

I might visit my local warehouse needing toothbrushes, some coffee, and maybe dress socks, then leave with a canoe or a giant teddy bear.\n\nCostco Founder Jim Sinegal explained the magic of the chain's model.\n\n\"We have created a Treasure Hunt atmosphere. When customers come in, they may find at one time we have a Coach handbag, and they come back, and we don’t have the Coach handbag, but perhaps we have some Levi’s we are selling at a hot price,\" he told Masters Invest.\n\nIt's all about making members feel the need to not miss out.\n\n\"We try to create a sense of urgency, that if you see the product, you’d better buy it because chances are it won’t be there next time. We purposely run out of merchandise to create that sense of urgency in our customers,” he added.\n\nNow, current Costco CEO Ron Vachris has shared some new big-name retail partnerships that the warehouse club will use to drive sales.\n\nThe treasure hunt model powers the Costco brand.\n\n\"Costco’s 'treasure hunt' shopping experience has become one of the most iconic and influential pieces of modern retail psychology. Customers walk through the warehouse expecting not only value but surprise. This element of discovery — the possibility of finding an unexpected deal, an unusually high-quality brand, or a limited-time item — is a cornerstone of Costco’s business strategy,\" shared Mojo Sales and Strategy.\n\nThe warehouse club, way back in Sinegal's days, knew how to drive human behaviour.\n\n\"It is not accidental. It is engineered psychology, and when understood correctly, it becomes a powerful tool for vendors who want to thrive inside Costco’s ecosystem,\" Mojo Sales and Strategy added.\n\nThe treasure-hunt concept is built on the behavioral principle that people are motivated by variability.\n\nCostco sees major shift in member behavior\n\nRetail chain shuts all locations as legal changes hit industry\n\nLululemon struggles to reverse concerning customer behavior\n\nT-Mobile launches free offer for customers after major loss\n\nCostco has continued to add to that variability by surprising members by adding new items from big brands.\n\n\"We added a number of new national brand partnerships across a range of non-food categories in Q1, including Gap and Ulta gift cards, Vera Bradley apparel, and Upper Deck trading cards,\" shared CFO Gary Millerchip during the chain's first-quarter earnings call.",

    "description": "Karen Gilchrist jokes that her \"maternal instincts kicked in late,\" but by 2024 she and her husband, Pablo Slough, decided to prioritize family over climbing the corporate ladder.",
    "fullText": "Over two decades of working in demanding roles managing teams around the world had taken a toll.\n\n\"I worked straight out of college, and then it was one job to the other job,\" Slough, 53, told Business Insider. \"It was always fast-paced, high stress.\"\n\nFor Gilchrist, turning 50 last summer drove her to reflect about how she'd spent her time and what she wanted to do moving forward.\n\n\"I joke sometimes that my maternal instincts kicked in late,\" Gilchrist told Business Insider. \"But it felt like the right moment to dedicate more time to my family than to work and climbing the corporate ladder.\"\n\nTheir oldest son, Luka, 18, is in his senior year and plans to head off to college in the fall. The other two, Mateo, 15, and Joaquin, 12, aren't far behind.\n\nTaking a gap year would give the couple a chance to step away from work, travel with their kids, and figure out their next steps.\n\nBut they didn't jump in immediately. The couple, based in Boulder, Colorado, hired a financial advisor a year in advance to make sure the plan was financially feasible.\n\n\"We also decided that we're going to rent our house out while we're traveling, so we could get some income,\" Slough said.\n\nAs their plans to quit became more concrete, the couple talked through everything with their kids. Funnily enough, it was their sons who seemed unsure at first.\n\n\"We were a bit surprised that our parents would actually do it because they have always been very focused on their careers,\" their second son, Mateo, told Business Insider.\n\nBut one of the reasons the couple wanted to do this was to show their kids that life isn't just about work, Gilchrist said.\n\n\"It's about life. It's about balancing things. It's about family,\" she said, adding that they hoped the experience would show their kids that life doesn't always have to follow a fixed path.\n\nThe couple considered it a career break, but the plan was not to travel the whole time.\n\n\"We didn't want to disrupt school,\" Slough said. \"So we just thought we'll come back for school, and then whatever free time we have, we'll travel.\"\n\nThe family spent the summer of 2024 traveling around Europe, a trip planned around their eldest son's three-week business course at a university in Barcelona.\n\nTheir travels began in Turkey, before they hopped on a cruise through Greece, Croatia, Malta, and Montenegro. After dropping their son off for his program, they explored Spain and Portugal before reuniting and heading to Colombia. They were back in Colorado a week before school started.\n\nThis year, their summer took them to Asia, with stops in Hong Kong, several cities in Thailand, Vietnam, China, and finally Japan.\n\n\"We all wanted to go to Asia, so we were really excited about it,\" Luka, their oldest son, told Business Insider.\n\nTo budget for their trips, the couple created an Excel sheet to track their daily expenses.\n\n\"We had an average spend per day that we wanted to aim for. It meant that in some places, we splurged because we wanted a really nice hotel. And in other places, we were a little bit more frugal,\" Gilchrist said, adding that they would update their expenses in real time to see if they were within their budget.\n\nLooking back on the trips, the family says they loved every moment.\n\n\"It felt like our parents were more present and flexible with us,\" Joaquin, their youngest, told Business Insider. \"We also learned more about each other's preferences, from the experiences and foods we enjoy to how each of us likes to spend our free time.\"\n\nDuring the months they weren't traveling, the couple spent their time at home doing things they rarely had time for before, such as exercising together, reading, and going to the movies every week.\n\n\"Now, we have this objective of cooking something completely new every day,\" Gilchrist said.\n\nThe couple says they feel less stressed, sleep better, and have genuinely enjoyed spending more time together.\n\n\"We're like, 'OK, we're going to be together all day long. What is that going to look like?' And truthfully, I think it's been amazing,\" Gilchrist said.\n\nBut the biggest benefit of taking time away from work has been having the space to reflect on what they wanted to do next, Slough said. He started teaching three days a week at a local university.\n\n\"It's something I've always wanted to do,\" Slough said. \"And then it just happened to come my way.\"\n\nHad he been working full-time, taking up this offer would have been out of the question, he said.\n\nThey also realized they didn't have to return to their corporate jobs to live comfortably. They could earn a portion of what they once made and still maintain their lifestyle.\n\nWorking with a financial advisor helped them identify areas where they were overspending and set a goal to cut their regular expenses by 30%. Before that, the couple had never closely tracked their finances.\n\n\"We were spending so much that we thought we needed really high-paying jobs to be able to continue,\" Slough said.\n\nKyle D. Dennehy, a financial advisor at California Financial Advisor who wasn't involved in the couple's planning, told Business Insider that the first step in preparing for a career break is to create a detailed budget that outlines all income sources, expenses, and savings goals.\n\n\"Once you have your 'normal' budget, estimate how each specific category will shift during an adult gap year, but keep your long-term goal savings like retirement contributions included in the gap year budget,\" Dennehy said.\n\nOnce the difference between the regular and new budgets is clear, a plan can be created to regularly contribute toward the updated savings goal, Dennehy said.\n\nNow, the couple is exploring whether to buy and run a small local business rather than slip back into corporate jobs. Gilchrist said they might never have considered entrepreneurship without the break.\n\n\"We joke, and we say that this time has also been a research and development phase for us on, 'OK, what does being productive over the next 10, 20 years look like?'\" Gilchrist said.\n\nOf course, there are risks that come with taking an extended career break, but careful financial planning has helped them manage those uncertainties.\n\n\"Plan it properly. It can't just be like, 'Oh, I quit my job this weekend, and we're going to travel for a year.' It will not work,\" Slough said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about taking a career break?

    "description": "As iRobot's founder Colin Angle looks back on its path to bankruptcy, he says it was hard to overcome competitors in China.",
    "fullText": "If there's one lesson iRobot founder Colin Angle took from the company's bankruptcy, it's never to underestimate competitors.\n\nOn December 14, iRobot, maker of the popular robotic vacuum Roomba, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and will be acquired by its primary contract manufacturer, Chinese company Picea Robotics.\n\nAngle said one of his biggest takeaways as iRobot enters its next phase is that even market leaders must remain alert to competition from China.\n\n\"It's certainly the advent of this new type of competitor, the Chinese fast follower, who had access to the Chinese marketplace, which iRobot effectively did not,\" he said on the tech podcast \"Hard Fork\" on Friday.\n\niRobot was founded in 1990 by Angle, Helen Greiner, and Rodney Brooks — roboticists at MIT — who had a \"vision of making practical robots a reality,\" the company says on its website. It released its popular robot vacuum, Roomba, in 2002, which effectively created the category of consumer robotics.\n\nFor the next two decades, Angle said that the company grew the category and, for a brief period, was the leading manufacturer of vacuuming robots in China. The company reached its peak revenue in 2021, at $1.56 billion.\n\nIn the years that followed, however, Angle said the home robotics market was upended by new entrants from China, such as Roborock, which had been chipping away at iRobot's dominance since its arrival in 2018. Other Chinese competitors include Dreame, Ecovacs, and Shar.\n\nAngle said that companies like Roborock had an advantage against iRobot because they had a \"protected market to cut your teeth on for the competition.\"\n\nChina made several moves to ensure that Chinese manufacturers in the category had an advantage by providing direct subsidies to iRobot's competitors, Angle said.\n\nOver the past few years, China has made significant strides toward becoming a global hub for robotics innovation and adoption, rolling out multiple strategic plans across several sectors. As part of those efforts, the government has subsidized robot purchases at an average rate of about 17.5% of equipment costs, according to the Asian Robotics Review.\n\nIn some cases, iRobot's features simply lagged behind its competitors.\n\n\"Honestly, we got wet mopping wrong,\" he said. Scuba, iRobot's mopping robot, never took off as an independent product.\n\n\"It certainly got hard, and it got increasingly competitive,\" Angle said. \"Ultimately, we were open to other strategies to enable us to continue to innovate.\"\n\nOne of those was striking a deal with Amazon, which attempted to acquire the company for $1.4 billion, but the deal was terminated following an antitrust review by the Federal Trade Commission and European regulators.\n\n\"The Commission's probe focused on Amazon's ability and incentive to favor its own products and disfavor rivals, and associated effects on innovation, entry barriers, and consumer privacy,\" the FTC said in a statement in 2024. \"The Commission's investigation revealed significant concerns about the transaction's potential competitive effects.\"\n\nAngle said the deal should have been a \"no-brainer\" in a recent interview with TechCrunch.\n\n\"What happened was that iRobot and Amazon came together for the expressed purpose of creating more innovation, more consumer choice, at a time when iRobot's trajectory was honestly different from where it was several years earlier,\" he told TechCrunch.\n\nHe said the FTC and the European Commission's investigation should not have gone longer than three or four weeks.\n\n\"What happened instead was a year and a half of pendency, which had a very challenging impact on the ability to operate a company and ultimately having the acquisition blocked,\" he said.\n\nHe said iRobot should serve as a cautionary tale for the future of US manufacturing.\n\n\"The net result, which, I have argued, was done with eyes wide open, was putting the consumer robot industry in a box, gift-wrapping it, and handing it to someone else,\" he told \"Hard Fork.\"",

The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI started dancing when I was three years old, after asking my mom for ballet lessons as we walked past a studio.\n\nFrom then on, all I wanted to do was dance. That love eventually led me somewhere I, as an introvert, never expected: Hong Kong Disneyland.\n\nIt started in 2017, when Hong Kong Disneyland held an audition at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts in Singapore, where I was studying for my diploma in dance.\n\nI went with a friend who didn't want to go alone. I had no expectations and just wanted to see how a professional audition works.\n\nAbout 50 dancers from the region participated in the audition.\n\nThey gave us a short jazz combination and had us perform it in small groups, cutting dancers until about 20 of us were left. They took our photos, measured our height, and recorded our body measurements.\n\nMonths later, while I was studying for my fine arts degree in New York, I was offered a standard one-year contract as a parade dancer at Hong Kong Disneyland.\n\nWhen I arrived in May 2018, I realized I was the only Singaporean parade dancer at the time. The team included dancers from Hong Kong, Japan, the Philippines, Russia, Taiwan, and Thailand.\n\nA typical day started around 11 a.m. We had a warm-up class, followed by makeup and costumes.\n\nWe typically performed two parades a day, one in the afternoon and one at night, for about 30 minutes each. During festive seasons like Christmas, we could have up to four parades a day.\n\nIn the middle of each parade, we would stop in front of the castle for a short \"show stop\" to interact with guests.\n\nRehearsals for the Halloween parades sometimes ended around 2 a.m. because they took place after the park closed for the night.\n\nThe Hong Kong heat can be terrible, and the night-parade costumes had lights wired through and batteries attached. You could feel the weight pressing on your shoulders.\n\nSometimes I felt homesick or lonely, but once you're in costume, you have to bring your full energy.\n\nWhen you step into Disneyland, you should feel like you're transported to a different world — a place where you can disconnect, forget your problems for a while, and just be happy.\n\nThis is why guests would never see dancers working out during breaks, because Disney wanted to keep the illusion. We were also not allowed to take any backstage photos or videos.\n\nThe magic is the reason some guests come to every parade. There were adults who followed the route, taking photos, and kids who waved at us every day. I remember a teenage boy who came almost every weekend, dancing beside the route the whole time.\n\nSome of them recognized us outside the park without our costumes. Others gave us prints of photos they had taken of us.\n\nIt was more than just branding and the experience.\n\nAt Hong Kong Disneyland, everyone, from the dancers to the sound crew, respected one another. Even when people were tired, they were still polite. That attitude really stuck with me.\n\nI learned that how I treat people — not just the audience, but also my colleagues, the costume team, and the stage managers — really affects how smoothly everything runs and whether people want to be around you.\n\nOn the other side, Disney valued its performers. It was very serious about safety and well-being. We had good medical insurance, which is important for dancers.\n\nAfter one year, I decided not to re-audition for contract renewal. I wanted to explore new challenges.\n\nI'm now a freelance dancer, teacher, and choreographer in Singapore, where I try to infuse Disney's spirit of \"magic\" into my work.\n\nDance training can be stressful for kids, especially during exams or competitions, so I try to keep that sense of fun alive and create an environment where my students feel safe and excited to learn.\n\nThe magic is about creating that little moment in class where someone feels proud or inspired.\n\nI also try to bring that same magic into my choreography. AI plays a small part in helping me express my ideas.\n\nAs a choreographer, I often have to write synopses for school performances or competitions, and that part is difficult because dancers think in movement, not in sentences.\n\nRecently, I started using ChatGPT to help organize my ideas. I don't let it write for me, but I use it to structure what I already have and express my thoughts more clearly.\n\nI'm also open to trying AI software for large-scale productions with apps that can help with pinpoint formations, map things out, and visualise spacing.\n\nOver the past two years, I was a choreographer for Singapore's National Day Parade performances, overseeing close to 600 students for one of them. I remember spending weeks figuring out formations by hand, staying up until 3 a.m. or 4 a.m., moving people around in Excel.\n\nIf AI could help with that, it would save so much time.\n\nBut technology can only assist — the emotion behind the movement still has to come from people.",

    "fullText": "When a power outage hit San Francisco on Saturday, local drivers had to navigate more than just darkened roads and inactive stoplights.\n\nFootage shared on social media shows some Waymo robotaxis stalled in traffic, clogging roadways and causing disruptions. One video on X showed at least five Waymos crowding an intersection, forcing human drivers to maneuver around them.\n\nThe power outage in San Francisco has caused Waymo’s self-driving cars to come to a halt, leading to traffic disruptions across the city. https://t.co/8vPCrKF9ze pic.twitter.com/kXjOJ3UN4c\n\nWaymo suspended its ride-hailing services on Saturday in response to the power outage, which affected about 130,000 Pacific Gas & Electric customers.\n\nOn Sunday, a spokesperson for Waymo told Business Insider that the company had resumed its service in the area.\n\n\"Yesterday's power outage was a widespread event that caused gridlock across San Francisco, with non-functioning traffic signals and transit disruptions,\" the spokesperson said. \"While the failure of the utility infrastructure was significant, we are committed to ensuring our technology adjusts to traffic flow during such events.\"\n\nOn X, Tesla CEO Elon Musk used the incident to promote his company's own robotaxis. \"Tesla Robotaxis were unaffected by the SF power outage,\" he wrote.\n\nTesla and Waymo are direct competitors in the autonomous ride-hailing market, but are relying on different technologies to get them there.\n\nTesla robotaxis use cameras and AI to find their way around. Waymo uses a suite of light sensors, radar, cameras, and detailed maps that are uploaded and regularly updated. That means sudden changes to the areas where a Waymo robotaxi operates could impact its ability to navigate.\n\nWaymo, owned by Alphabet Inc., debuted its autonomous ride-hailing service to the public in 2018 in the Phoenix metro area.\n\nThe company has expanded its services to other cities, including Austin and Atlanta, through a partnership with Uber, but it hasn't all been smooth sailing.\n\nIn May, Waymo recalled the software for more than 1,200 cars after some collided with \"chains or gates.\" More recently, a Waymo vehicle hit and killed a beloved bodega cat in San Francisco, sparking outrage from residents.",

    "fullText": "The Israeli military said it shot dead a Palestinian “suspected of hurling a block” at soldiers on Saturday during an operation in the occupied West Bank town of Qabatiya.\n\nVideo reviewed by CNN shows a soldier shooting the teen when he is just feet away. In an earlier statement, the military did not use the word “suspected,” and said the person “hurled a block toward the soldiers.”\n\nThe Palestinian was identified as 16-year-old Rayan Muhammad Abdul Qader Abu Mualla by the Ministry of Health, citing the Palestinian General Authority of Civil Affairs (PGACA), who said his body is still being held by Israel after he was killed in the Al-Sab’aneh neighborhood in Qabatiya.\n\nA 26-second security camera video shared on social media and geolocated by CNN to Al-Sab’aneh, shows what appears to be the moment Israeli troops shot Abu Mualla.\n\nIn the video, a person walks down an alley towards two helmeted soldiers crouched partially behind a corner. The person is just about to reach the corner when one soldier raises his rifle and fires at point blank range, causing the person to collapse backwards.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in its initial statement that its soldiers had been attacked by a “terrorist.” The video shows the 18 seconds before the shooting, in which time nothing appears to be thrown from the alley the Palestinian teenager comes from. His left hand, however, is obscured. It was not immediately clear who captured the footage, who initially released it, or what happened before the video begins.\n\nOn Saturday, the Israeli news site Ynet published what it says is a photo of Abu Mualla’s left hand clutching a chunk of concrete, taken after his death. CNN could not verify whether the photo is of the same person in the security footage.\n\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent said that Israeli troops blocked its emergency workers from reaching the scene of the shooting.\n\nA set of videos geolocated by CNN show an ambulance, with its emergency lights on, stopped about 650 feet away from the site of the shooting.\n\nAsked for comment on the video and the allegation that emergency workers were blocked from reaching Abu Mualla, the IDF said: “Yesterday (Saturday), a Palestinian suspected of hurling a block at IDF soldiers was shot. The incident is under review.”\n\nLate on Saturday, Abu Mualla’s school announced on Facebook that it would close on Sunday in honor of his memory and pushed exams a week ahead.\n\nIn a separate incident on Saturday, the Ministry of Health said the IDF shot and killed a 22-year-old Palestinian man named Ahmed Saed Ziyoud in Silat al-Harathiya, a town north of Jenin in the West Bank.\n\nThe IDF said in a statement on Telegram that it shot an individual in Silat al-Harathiya who “hurled an explosive” toward soldiers.\n\nOn Sunday, the military wing of the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine, said he was a fighter in the Al-Quds Brigades. He was shot by an Israeli sniper’s bullet during the IDF storming of the town.\n\nCNN’s Dana Karni contributed to this report.",

    "description": "Excavations revealed everything from a 14th-century Black Death group burial to three skeletons from the late 12th or early 13th centuries buried in coffins.",
    "fullText": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nHere’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nThe first excavation at the famed Tower of London in a generation uncovered more than 20 skeletal remains.\n\nExcavations revealed everything from a 14th-century Black Death group burial to three skeletons from the late 12th or early 13th centuries buried in coffins.\n\nThe on-site chapel is serving as a tell-all of London’s medieval history.\n\nA rare dig into the soil of the famed Tower of London—the first excavation at the site in a generation—yielded two skeletons from around 1500. As archaeologists dug deeper into the ground, they found roughly 20 more burials, including one group grave likely tied to the 1348 “Black Death” plague.\n\n“Undertaking these two excavations has provided us with a generational opportunity to enhance our understanding of the evolution off the Chapel of Saint Peter ad Vincula, and the buildings which stood before it,” Alfred Hawkins, curator of historic buildings at Historic Royal Palaces, the organization that oversees the Tower, said in a statement.\n\nThe dig began as a trial excavation in 2019 to prepare the on-site Chapel Royal of St Peter ad Vincula for a new elevator. The archaeologists helming the excavation discovered the remains of two skeletons. Subsequent excavations outside the chapel as deep as 10 feet below the surface revealed everything from a 14th-century Black Death group burial to three skeletons from the late 12th or early 13th centuries buried in coffins—an unusually expensive burial for that time.\n\nJane Sidell, principal inspector of ancient monuments at Historic England, said the team is already gaining insight into the residents of the Tower in a way they never have before. “This is just the tip of the iceberg,” she said in a statement. “There is so much more to learn through further analysis about the people as well as the buildings of one of England’s most evocative historic monuments.”\n\nThe Tower of London was built alongside the River Thames in the 1070s as a royal palace. It also served as a prison for high-status individuals (including King Henry VI), and housed the country’s Royal Mint. But it has seemingly almost always had a chapel on its grounds.\n\nThe current parish church for the residents of the Tower of London was built in 1520, after a 1512 fire devoured the one King Edward I built in 1287. A compacted layer of stone found in the recent excavation could be a 1240 project at the site led by Henry III, showing there was a chapel before 1287.\n\nAnd since the current chapel sits atop the same land as the Tower’s previous chapel foundations, burials aplenty are to be expected. Of the recent finds, the older burials could have even been buried inside one of the long-destroyed chapels. “Typically, if you’re buried closer to the church, you’re more important, and if you’re buried inside the church, you’re much, much more important, and if you’re buried under the altar, you are the most important person,” Hawkins said, according to National Geographic.\n\nKnown burials at the site include three queens and two Catholic saints, but finding out more about the unknown skeletons could help piece together the medieval story of the site.\n\n“The new excavations provide the opportunity to transform our understanding of the Tower’s community,” Katie Faillace from Cardiff University’s School of History, Archaeology, and Religion, said in a statement. “Our work uses a biomolecular technique known as isotope analysis, which tells us about health, diet, and mobility in the past, all from a tiny fragment of a tooth. This cutting-edge method was unparalleled potential for reconstructing the experiences of the people who lived and died at the Tower, allowing us to build a rich picture of individuals’ lives.”\n\nThe analysis on the first two skeletons starts developing that picture. Richard Madgwick, archaeological scientist at Cardiff University and part of the team, told National Geographic that one individual was likely a middle-aged female who died between 1480 and 1550. Clues indicate she likely lived as far away as Wales at one point, and had a diet featuring sugar—an expensive ingredient at the time.\n\nThe second skeleton belonged to a younger man who died around the same time. Details of his remains show a high-stress life that likely played out just north of London. His diet was much less exotic.\n\n“I’m looking forward to starting analysis of some of the other amazing finds we have uncovered along the way,” Hawkins said. “This is a very, very rare opportunity to get this information.”\n\nAlong with the remains, the team found a rare burial shroud from the late 12th or early 13th century (fabric doesn’t usually last through the ages), jewelry, shards of stained glass, and rare grave goods in the form of funerary incense pots dated to between 1150 and 1250 (with charcoal still inside them).\n\n“At the moment we’ve got these lovely two biographies,” Madgwick said. “It hints at the dynamic movement of people and the dynamic life trajectories of the people who were buried in the Tower, but it’s going to be really exciting to see whether we’ve picked two anomalies, or whether we see the broader range of lifeways that we see of those buried here.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

The boss reportedly bought himself a Ferrari and gave his 17-year-old daughter a brand-new Lamborghini Urus. Meanwhile, employees were denied a cost-of-living adjustment and forced into a cheaper health insurance plan.\n\nThe employee wrote, “This man and his attorneys have the gall to deny us a cost of living increase and just switched our health insurance to United Healthcare to save a few dollars.”\n\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nDeloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\n\nOne moment that particularly stung involved a coworker who died in a car accident. The company owner sent the widow a card with $50 in cash and a $50  gift card. The employees, by contrast, pooled $1,800 of their own money to support the grieving family.\n\n“The employees contributed to the funeral and final expenses,” the poster added. “And he sent her $50 and a gift card.”\n\nThis touched off many responses from other workers with similar stories. One commenter wrote, “This happened at my husband’s old job. Everyone in the family got brand new cars, and they took away paid holidays and [paid time off]… they lost three people within a month.”\n\nAnother said they discovered their boss was sending offers on used Rolls-Royces on eBay, while refusing to increase pay.\n\nTrending: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace—Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\n\nThe post resonated because it reflects a broader frustration among American workers. Many commenters noted that lavish executive lifestyles often come directly at the expense of employees.\n\n“He isn't buying luxury cars despite not paying you and switching you to cheaper insurance,” one person wrote. “He is buying luxury cars because he's not paying you… That is your money.”\n\nAnother commenter summed it up like this: “Record profits are stolen wages.”\n\nPeople shared stories of bosses who slashed hours, removed retirement contributions, and still found ways to upgrade their luxury lifestyles. Several said they were pushed to donate paid time off to terminally ill coworkers while the owners hoarded profits.\n\nOne person recalled, “Two weeks later [after saying he couldn’t afford raises], he bought a fully loaded Rivian R1T in cash.”\n\nSee Also: Missed Tesla?

Another added, “Striking is reasonable, but starting a competing firm with highly motivated team members is even better.”\n\nStill, some felt hopeless, arguing that these issues are systemic. One commenter wrote, “This is 2025 USA in a nutshell.”\n\nWhether or not anything changes for the workers in the original post, the message from the thread is that when employees are asked to sacrifice while their bosses flaunt obscene wealth, it's not just bad optics; it feels like a slap in the face.\n\nRead Next: Wall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors — Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

    "fullText": "West Ham are set to appoint Rita Guarino as their women's team manager following the sacking of Rehanne Skinner.\n\nThe Italian, who picked up 99 caps for her national team as a player, has not yet managed outside of Italy.\n\nShe was most recently in charge of Inter Milan between 2021 and 2024, having previously led Juventus to four successive Serie A titles.\n\nThe 54-year-old has experience working with youth teams from her time with Italy's under-17s, who she acted as head coach and assistant for.\n\nSkinner was sacked by West Ham on Thursday after winning only one of their 11 Women's Super League matches this season.\n\nIt is believed West Ham had been monitoring the availability of Guarino before the winter break, with a view to appointing her.\n\nGuarino's arrival will be seen as a bold move by West Ham because she is a relative unknown in England.\n\nOne of her first priorities will be to navigate the January transfer window as West Ham look to move up the table. They currently sit second bottom, two points above Liverpool.",

    "description": "Watters, 47, recounted the alleged conversation to a large crowd at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest in Phoenix on Dec. 20",
    "fullText": "Fox News host Jesse Watters claimed that President Donald Trump told him he is building the new White House ballroom as a “monument” to himself\n\nHe added that Trump said he was doing so because “no one else will”\n\nWatters recounted the alleged conversation while speaking at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest in Phoenix on Dec. 20\n\nJesse Watters claims President Donald Trump told him he is constructing the new White House ballroom as a “monument” to himself — and that he’s doing it “because no one else will.”\n\nThe Fox News host recounted the alleged conversation while speaking at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest, a multiday conservative conference and festival in Phoenix, on Saturday, Dec. 20. A video of the moment has since been posted on X.\n\nWatters, 47, told the large crowd that he was sharing a meal with Trump, 79, when the president asked him if he wanted to see a rendition of “the big, beautiful ballroom.”\n\n“I said, ‘Sure, let me see it,’ “ Watters continued. “He [Trump] rolls the whole thing out. And guys, I don't know if you know this — the ballroom is huge. Like, I said, ‘Mr. President, the ballroom is four times the size of the White House.' ”\n\n“He said, ‘Jesse, it's a monument. I'm building a monument to myself — because no one else will,' \" Watters added, eliciting loud laughs from the audience.\n\nThe PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now!\n\nTrump recently said that the 90,000-square-foot ballroom, which is being built on the site of the former East Wing, will now cost $400 million — a significant jump from earlier estimates.\n\nTrump announced the updated price tag on Dec. 17 during a Hanukkah reception at the White House, where he also revealed that a federal judge has allowed construction on the controversial project to move forward. He repeated the figure multiple times while thanking the official for clearing the way for continued construction, describing the ruling as an act of “courage.”\n\nThe ballroom — which is being funded entirely by private donors, including a contribution from Trump himself — is expected to be completed by summer 2028.\n\nTrump has argued that the sprawling ballroom is needed so future presidents can host large events indoors rather than on the South Lawn.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nIt's unclear just how many people the space can accommodate. Trump told NBC News in September that it would hold up to 900 people; BBC reporting cites plans for a capacity of 1,350.\n\nOn Dec. 16, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon rejected a request from the National Trust for Historic Preservation to temporarily halt construction while the project undergoes additional review, the Associated Press reported.\n\nHowever, the judge said he plans to hold a hearing in January on the group’s request for a preliminary injunction and warned the administration not to make underground construction decisions that would lock in the design of the ballroom above ground, per Bloomberg.",

    "description": "Chief cricket reporter Stephan Shemilt marks the performances of the Australia and England teams after the third Test in Adelaide.",
    "fullText": "Australia have beaten England by 82 runs in the third Test to go 3-0 up and secure the Ashes at the earliest opportunity.\n\nHere are our player ratings for the Adelaide contest:\n\nBen Duckett – 2 – Arrived with a reputation as one of the best openers in the world, only to suffer a collapse in form and presence. Failures of others were predictable, Duckett's was not and is a huge concern.\n\nZak Crawley – 6 – Showed admirable fight and adaptability in England's second innings, but probably needs a hundred to be immune from a post-series clearout.\n\nOllie Pope – 2 – Test career over for now? Averages 17.6 in Ashes Tests. Since 1900, only England's Dennis Amiss has had as many as Pope's 16 innings in the top six in Ashes Tests and averaged less.\n\nJoe Root – 4 – Two starts, without making a telling contribution. Twice dismissed by Cummins, for whom Root is a bunny. The Yorkshireman must be pleased the Australia captain missed the first two Tests of the series.\n\nHarry Brook – 5 – Largely stayed true to his promise to \"rein it in\", but the second-innings dismissal reverse-sweeping Lyon was ugly. Would be a huge waste if Australia does not see his best on this tour.\n\nBen Stokes – 6 – Battled bravely in England's first innings, even if his resistance never seemed likely to turn into a trademark miracle. Did not bowl when England needed him on day three.\n\nJamie Smith – 6 – Finally got into the series with a counter-attacking 60 in the second innings, now has to kick on in Melbourne and Sydney.\n\nWill Jacks – 6 – A part-time spinner unfairly asked to do the job of a veteran. Resisted admirably with the bat, making himself harder to leave out.\n\nBrydon Carse – 5 – Continuing a bizarre tour of picking up wickets despite not bowling well. England have a decision to make over the Durham man in Melbourne.\n\nJofra Archer – 8 – Emerging as England's player of the tour. A maiden Test half-century and first five-wicket haul in six years. Demonstrating it was more than worth the wait for him to return to full fitness.\n\nJosh Tongue – 6 – Encouraging return after being overlooked for the first two Tests. Was the unfortunate bowler for the Khawaja drop and Carey Snicko shocker. Should get another go in Melbourne.\n\nJake Weatherald - 2 - Quiet game after a promising start to his Test career. Would be a potential Australian weakness for England to exploit had the Ashes not already been lost.\n\nTravis Head – 8 – Any flicker of hope England might have had was snuffed out by a century from South Australia's favourite son in the second innings. Head's promotion to open the batting is a defining moment in the outcome of the series.\n\nMarnus Labuschagne – 5 – No real contribution with the bat, but gets an extra mark apiece for two sensational catches at second slip. Still a nagging doubt he has a big score in him before the end of the series.\n\nUsman Khawaja – 7 – Took his chance after Steve Smith's illness, albeit via a life from Harry Brook. Should keep his place for Sydney.\n\nCameron Green – 4 – Could not produce a performance to match his huge Indian Premier League pricetag and batting two places too high. Took the important wicket of Brook in the first innings.\n\nAlex Carey – 8 – Challenging Mitchell Starc as player of the series. Loses a point because he should have been given out in the first innings.\n\nJosh Inglis – 4 – An important 32 when England sensed momentum on the first day, but hasn't fully taken his chance. Could be squeezed out when Smith returns.\n\nPat Cummins – 7 – How has this man not bowled since July? Immediately into the groove with relentless accuracy. Once again an Ashes-winning captain.\n\nMitchell Starc – 6 – Not touching the heights of the first two Tests, though bowled with high pace in the first innings and took the key wickets of Jamie Smith and Will Jacks on the final day.\n\nNathan Lyon – 6 – Broke England's resistance with a triple-wicket burst on the fourth evening, only to hobble off with a hamstring injury on the final day. Could be out for the series.\n\nScott Boland – 6 – Unsung hero of Australia's attack, keeping up the pressure when the superstars rest. Will be in the conversation to rest in Melbourne, the venue where he destroyed England four years ago.\n\n'Bazball as we knew it is in the skip - but McCullum has England future'\n\nBooze, beach, beaten – how England lost the Ashes\n\nThe 10 moments that decided the Ashes\n\nStokes wants to remain captain despite Ashes defeat",

    "fullText": "On the winter solstice, some light finally illuminated the darkness of Wilfried Nancy's opening 17 days as Celtic manager.\n\nAt the fifth time of trying, the Frenchman oversaw his first victory after four wretched defeats across the Scottish Premiership, League Cup and Europa League.\n\nIt keeps them within six points of leaders Hearts, having played a game fewer, and was likely as deserved a win as he has ever achieved given just how dominant his side were against Aberdeen at Celtic Park.\n\nFor 20 second-half minutes, Celtic were scintillating. Like a throwback to the good old days under Brendan Rodgers, Ange Postecoglou or even Martin O'Neill.\n\nWith 31 shots on goal, 10 on target and an xG (expected goals) of 4.5, Celtic should have been out of sight. The only thing for supporters to worry about should have been some last-minute Christmas shopping.\n\nBut when Kenan Bilalovic thudded his shot under Kasper Schmeichel to draw 10-man Aberdeen inexplicably level with 16 minutes to remaining, concerns were firmly focused on Nancy again.\n\nSince taking change from O'Neill less than three weeks ago, many fans will have wondered if he realised what he'd walked into.\n\nAnd while Nancy would be forgiven for failing to make sense of Sunday's ridiculous contest, he'll not be given so much leeway if the rays of light on show against Aberdeen don't turn into a full new dawn.",

    "fullText": "Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse pushed back hard against a fresh XRP manipulation claim after the token slid to $1.77 before rebounding toward $1.88 during a choppy December. The move capped a 5% weekly drop. Even though XRP still trades in a higher range since Ripple’s courtroom win over the SEC.\n\nThe comments arrive in a market where new XRP futures, ETFs, and a Ripple-backed stablecoin are all reshaping how money flows around the beloved community asset.\n\nGarlinghouse told CNN that “nobody is in a position to manipulate XRP prices.” he noted that XRP trades with multi‑billion‑dollar daily volume and tracks the crypto market rather than Ripple’s internal decisions. He said XRP is now too big and too liquid for one actor, Ripple’s backend included, to move it like a tiny micro‑cap coin.\n\nThink of liquidity like the size of the swimming pool. A small bucket of water can change the level in a kiddie pool, but not in an Olympic one. Garlinghouse said low‑liquidity tokens are vulnerable to pump‑and‑dump games, but XRP’s scale makes that far harder.\n\nAccording to CoinDesk, XRP futures volume alone recently ran toward $4 billion during a sharp move, which is not the profile of a thin, easily pushed market. Although it’s dropping now, so does the crypto market.\n\n(source – Ripple Future Volume Today, CoinGecko)\n\nHe also emphasized that banks using Ripple’s payment technology purchase XRP on the open market, not through undisclosed sweetheart deals. These large buyers often agree to lockup terms so they cannot instantly flip all their tokens back into cash, which helps smooth out sudden dumps. For a beginner, this means institutional players usually face guardrails that you, as a small trader, do not see but still benefit from.\n\nDISCOVER: 16+ New and Upcoming Binance Listings in 2025\n\nOne long‑running fear in the XRP community: Ripple owns a huge stash and might “dump” it on the market. Ripple now keeps around 34.4 billion XRP in escrow and 5.1 billion in spendable wallets, releasing 1 billion each month, then relocking most of it. That schedule informs you in advance how much XRP might enter the market, which is important because sudden selling is what usually scares prices the most.\n\nGarlinghouse said Ripple usually keeps only about 200 million XRP per month for operations and returns the rest to escrow. He admitted in an older Financial Times quote that Ripple would not be cash-flow positive without XRP sales, but he argued that those sales now follow a predictable and transparent pattern. As a beginner, you do not need to love that model, but you at least know the faucet is on a timer, not a random fire hose.",

Those affected by the shake-up are not losing their foreign service jobs but will be returning to Washington for other assignments should they wish to take them, the officials said.\n\nThe State Department declined to comment on specific numbers or ambassadors affected, but defended the changes, calling them “a standard process in any administration.” It noted that an ambassador is “a personal representative of the president and it is the president’s right to ensure that he has individuals in these countries who advance the America First agenda.”\n\nAfrica is the continent most affected by the removals, with ambassadors from 13 countries being removed: Burundi, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Madagascar, Mauritius, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Somalia and Uganda.\n\nSecond is Asia, with ambassadorial changes coming to six countries: Fiji, Laos, the Marshall Islands, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines and Vietnam affected.\n\nFour countries in Europe (Armenia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Slovakia) are affected; as are two each in the Middle East (Algeria and Egypt); South and Central Asia (Nepal and Sri Lanka); and the Western Hemisphere (Guatemala and Suriname).\n\nPolitico was the first to report on the ambassadorial recalls, which have drawn concern from some lawmakers and the union representing American diplomats.",

    "fullText": "The Kennedy Center is already losing performers after Donald Trump slapped his name on the storied arts institution.\n\nKristy Lee, a folk singer scheduled to perform at the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts on Jan. 14, is in talks to cancel her appearance, her spokesperson told NOTUS, as other artists also move to sever ties with the venue.\n\nOne performer, who spoke to NOTUS on the condition of anonymity, said Trump’s renaming had left a permanent “stain” on the center.\n\nAnother lamented what the Kennedy Center once represented—for artists and for the country at large. “I feel really badly for performers, not just for performers but for the people who work there,” they said.\n\n“Kennedy Center is supposed to be a memorial, focusing on being nonpartisan. A place where people, it doesn’t matter what party they believe in, should be performing and experiencing the arts together regardless of what their party is. And it has not become that.”\n\nOther artists who reluctantly chose to keep their scheduled performances at the center told NOTUS they are doing so as an act of resistance to the 79-year-old president.\n\n“Reality show personality and con artist aren’t the type of artist the center showcases,” one artist said. They added that they “don’t associate the arts, or this building, with Trump.”\n\n“And I guess the real debate up till now is what you boycott it and help ensure it goes down the tubes,” the musician added. “Or do you do the concerts and keep the audiences that love going to the Kennedy Center. And make sure there’s something there after this guy leaves. And it could be restored from however he trashes it.”\n\nThe backlash follows an announcement Thursday from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt that the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts would be tackily renamed to include Trump’s name after a vote by the venue’s board, which is now stacked with MAGA loyalists.\n\n“Congratulations to President Donald J. Trump, and likewise, congratulations to President Kennedy, because this will be a truly great team long into the future!” she wrote on X. “The building will no doubt attain new levels of success and grandeur.”\n\nThe board includes White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles; Attorney General Pam Bondi; second lady Usha Vance; Deputy White House Chief of Staff Dan Scavino; and Allison Lutnick, the wife of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.\n\nA source told CNN that Trump phoned into Thursday’s meeting ahead of the vote.\n\nA day later, the president’s name was quickly and tackily plastered onto the center’s building, which now reads: “The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.”\n\nDemocrats and historians, however, have insisted that renaming the venue requires an act of Congress.\n\n“The Kennedy Center was named by law. To change the name would require a revision of that 1964 law,” Ray Smock, a former House historian, wrote in an email to the Associated Press. “The Kennedy Center board is not a lawmaking entity. Congress makes laws.”\n\nMeanwhile, many of Kennedy’s relatives have expressed their outrage.\n\n“Three years and one month from today, I’m going to grab a pickax and pull those letters off that building, but I’m going to need help holding the ladder,” Kerry Kennedy, 66, wrote on X Friday.\n\nThe lawyer and former president’s niece added: “Are you in? Applying for my carpenter’s card today, so it’ll be a union job!!!”\n\nTrump set his sights on the center months ago and has repeatedly suggested it be renamed the Trump-Kennedy Center in public remarks and on social media. At the same time, ticket sales have reportedly plummeted and audiences thinned since Trump’s takeover.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",
