    "fullText": "Raphinha’s influence in the current Barcelona setup is no longer up for debate.\n\nWhile the team managed to collect results during his absence earlier in the season, his return to the starting XI has clearly altered the rhythm, balance, and intensity of the side.\n\nThe Brazilian winger has brought back elements that were quietly missing, particularly in pressing, transitions, and collective effort without the ball.\n\nIn the weeks Raphinha spent sidelined through injury, Barcelona continued to win, but there was a noticeable drop in the sharpness of the frontline press.\n\nCertain attacking movements looked slower, and the overall aggression that defined last season’s best performances was reduced.\n\nAs such, the structure was still there, but the edge was not.\n\nSince his return, the contrast has been striking, and Barcelona’s results tell part of the story, with eight wins and just one defeat since he came back into the squad.\n\nMore tellingly, when Raphinha has started, the record is perfect – five wins from five games, with the forward scoring four goals and one assist.\n\nRaphiniha was decisive against Villarreal. (Photo by Alex Caparros/Getty Images)\n\nNow, it would be unfair to criticise Marcus Rashford, who performed well during Raphinha’s absence.\n\nHowever, the Brazilian offers something different. Defensively, he is more intense. Tactically, he is more disciplined. And emotionally, he brings an edge that lifts the collective effort.\n\nThe recent clash against Villarreal was a perfect example. Raphinha played with one gear more than everyone else.\n\nHe was aggressive in transitions, relentless in duels, and constantly driving the team forward. He pressed, chased, recovered, and fought every battle as if it were the last.\n\nHis influence was decisive in the opening goal and from that moment on, he never stopped.\n\nThis version of Raphinha is one of the main reasons why the mood around Barcelona has shifted so quickly.\n\nIn just one month, the performances feel more complete and the team arguably looks more connected.",

He is one of the best around at the moment.\n\n\"At the start of the season, Villa fans were booing him because he'd had his head turned! You have to give credit to Emery as manager here for backing him.\n\n\"He didn't take him out of the squad, he left him in there to deal with the pressure. That has taken him to a different level, along with some other players, and you can see Rogers is excited to play because he just glides past players.\n\n\"I would pay good money every week to go and watch him - that is how good he is. \"\n\nListen to the Football Daily podcast on BBC Sounds",

    "fullText": "Barcelona continued their scintillating La Liga form with a 2-0 victory over Villarreal in their final match of 2025. Goals from Raphinha and Lamine Yamal made it eight league wins in a row for the Catalans, who end the year with a four-point lead in the standings.\n\nThe match saw Frenkie de Jong make his return to the starting line-up after a number of weeks on the bench, and he was one of the standouts for Barcelona. As per Sport, he gave his reaction the victory in the mixed zone.\n\n“I’m very happy. We closed the year as leaders, which was the objective. Villarreal come out quickly on the counter and have dangerous players. I felt that we were superior. It was a well-deserved victory. We’re fine. Now is not the time for titles, but we are alive in everything.”\n\nJoan Garcia produced another impressive showing on his way to a clean sheet, and the Barcelona goalkeeper also spoke on the match to the club’s official media channels (via MD).\n\n“We knew it was very important to get the three points in the last game of the year. We have achieved it and we finished top in this first half of the season. There is still a long way to go but we had this objective and we have achieved it.\n\n“When a team is down one player, it always makes things easier for you. We would have liked to kill the game earlier and score the second before and then make a third, but they played very well and knew how to defend with ten men. The important thing is that we got the three points and kept a clean sheet.\n\n“I try to stop the ones that come to me. There are days when I can do it and others I can’t. Today, luckily, we got a clean sheet and I’m very happy.”\n\nGerard Martin also spoke to the media after the match at La Ceramica, and as per MD, he expressed pride over Barcelona’s growth in recent months.\n\n“We have grown a lot since the beginning of the season. We have improved in many things and it is showing in recent games. Villarreal are a difficult team and a difficult ground. We knew they hadn’t lost and it was important to win because we were at the top of the standings. It seems like an easy game, but it was complicated.”",

And now, we have a better idea of what prompted the incident, courtesy of the fan who was attacked.\n\nDuring the Week 16 matchup, the Detroit Free Press spoke with Ryan Kennedy, the fan involved in the altercation with Metcalf, who shared what he said that triggered the crashout seen around the world — calling the Steelers wide receiver by his full name, DeKaylin Zecharius Metcalf.\n\n“He doesn’t like his government name. I called him that and then he grabbed me and ripped my shirt,” Kennedy said via the Detroit Free Press. “I’m a little shocked. Like, everyone’s talking to me. I’m a little rattled, but I just want the Lions to win, baby.”\n\nWith around three minutes remaining in the second quarter, Metcalf was captured grabbing Kennedy, then forcefully shoving him back after the two exchanged words.\n\nThe NFL clarified that Metcalf couldn’t be ejected due to no flag being thrown, but they are investigating the incident, and he could face discipline from the league.\n\nFor up-to-date Steelers coverage, \n\nThis article originally appeared on Steelers Wire: Steelers' DK Metcalf-fan altercation receives strange update",

They can't afford to have him out while Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo are away [at Afcon].\n\n\"He is so crucial to the team so hopefully it will only be a few weeks.

    "fullText": "It was a case of better late than never for the Hoops against Aberdeen at Celtic Park this afternoon, with Kieran Tierney putting Celtic 2-1 ahead with a few minutes to go before James Forrest made it 3-1 in stoppage time though, in truth, it was a result that the Hoops thoroughly deserved.\n\nIt was a significant goal from Forrest, not least of all because it made the three points secure, but because it meant that the club’s most decorated player extended his scoring run to an incredible 17 consecutive seasons.\n\nWhilst that number on its own is mightily impressive in its own right, the context of that achievement has to be considered to fully appreciate the importance of Forrest's goal today.\n\nIt means that the 34-year-old, who has picked up 26 major honours in the Hoops, has now scored in more consecutive seasons than Paul McStay and the club’s greatest goalscorer, Jimmy McGrory.\n\nIt also means that, after surpassing Bobby Lennox’s trophy haul earlier this year, he has now equalled the Lisbon Lion’s record of goals in 17 consecutive seasons, with only the early 1900s legend, Jimmy McMenemy ahead of him on 18 seasons.\n\nSpeaking to Celtic TV alongside Kieran Tierney after the match, James Forrest reflected on today’s achievement.\n\nHe said: “To play at this club for such a long time has been unbelievable and I’ve enjoyed every minute.\n\n“It’s great to help the lads and keep going, and I think that all the boys showed character today. Hopefully we can kick on from here.”\n\nYou can watch James Forrest and Kieran Tierney’s full post-match interview below.\n\nCeltic Vs.

    "fullText": "Liverpool are facing an uncomfortable period of uncertainty after concerns emerged over the fitness of Alexander Isak, with early indications suggesting the striker could be sidelined for a significant period. While the full extent of the injury is still being assessed, the situation has already sharpened internal discussions around January signings and squad depth during a decisive phase of the season.\n\nIsak’s injury arrives at an awkward moment. Liverpool have invested heavily in attacking options over the past year, yet circumstances have shifted quickly. Injuries, suspensions and international commitments are converging, leaving the club exposed in areas that were expected to be well covered. The coming days, particularly the results of further medical examinations, will play a critical role in shaping Liverpool’s strategy for the winter transfer window.\n\nThere is a deliberate sense of caution around Isak’s condition. Liverpool are waiting for comprehensive scan results before forming a definitive prognosis, but early concern within the club suggests the issue may not be short-term. The striker was visibly distressed when leaving the pitch, and staff were immediately aware that the injury could carry broader implications beyond one match or even one month.\n\nSince his arrival, Isak’s time on Merseyside has already been disrupted by physical setbacks. Another prolonged absence would not only slow his own adaptation but also place additional strain on a forward line that is already being reshaped week by week. Liverpool’s medical team are understood to be taking a conservative approach, prioritising long-term recovery over any rushed return.\n\nLiverpool had been monitoring the January market even before Isak’s injury, but the urgency has increased according to the Telegraph. Recruitment staff are actively reviewing options who could provide immediate cover across the front line, particularly players capable of operating in multiple attacking roles. Flexibility is seen as essential, given the unpredictable nature of injuries and suspensions during the second half of the campaign.\n\nWhile no final decision has been taken, the possibility of January signings is firmly on the table. Liverpool are unlikely to make reactive or inflated deals, yet there is an acceptance internally that the squad may require reinforcement to sustain momentum domestically and in Europe. Financially, the club retains scope to act, having planned prudently despite substantial recent expenditure.\n\nThe preference would be for a player who can contribute straight away rather than a long-term project. Availability, fitness history and adaptability to the Premier League are all being weighed carefully as part of the assessment process.\n\nIsak’s injury is not an isolated issue. Liverpool are managing a growing list of absentees, with several players either unavailable or facing enforced breaks due to suspension and international duty. This congestion is placing additional responsibility on a relatively small group of attackers, increasing the risk of fatigue and further injuries.\n\nFrom a tactical perspective, the coaching staff are already exploring short-term adjustments to manage workloads and maintain attacking output. However, internal belief remains that structural solutions, rather than temporary fixes, may be required if Isak is ruled out for an extended period.\n\nThe January schedule offers little margin for error. League fixtures, cup commitments and the broader demands of a title challenge mean Liverpool cannot afford a prolonged dip in attacking efficiency.\n\nMuch depends on the clarity that emerges from Isak’s medical assessment. A minor setback would likely see Liverpool hold their position and trust the depth already in place. A more serious diagnosis, however, would almost certainly accelerate plans around January signings.\n\nLiverpool’s approach remains calm and methodical. There is no appetite for panic, but there is also a recognition that inaction carries its own risks. The balance between patience and decisiveness will define their winter strategy, with Isak’s injury acting as the central variable.\n\nFor now, the club wait. Yet behind the scenes, preparations are being made to ensure Liverpool are not left short-handed should the worst-case scenario materialise.",

The goal is to return to the Champions League after seven years, and the Giallorossi coach wants to repay the faith that the Friedkins and the fans have placed in him.\n\nThe ideas, therefore, are quite clear. Gasp is now waiting for action, with Massara accelerating moves for Zirkzee and Raspadori and also working on finding a new home for Dovbyk.

    "fullText": "Roma are accelerating, and they’re following a very clear path: sending a strong signal to Gian Piero Gasperini right away.\n\nKeeping him calm—and above all, confident—also depends on the transfer market, and the first name circled in red is Giacomo Raspadori.\n\nThe Atlético Madrid striker has been a target for the Giallorossi manager for years, dating back to his time at Atalanta, and now he could become the first real signing of the winter.\n\nBetween today and tomorrow, Gazzetta dello Sport reports, Massara will make a decisive move, with contacts already scheduled with both the player’s entourage and the Spanish club, to determine if the deal can be completed quickly.\n\nAccording to La Repubblica, an agreement could be reached as early as today.\n\nIn Madrid, Raspadori hasn’t found the playing time he expected. The Colchoneros’ investment was significant, but his performance and playing time aren’t living up to expectations. Hence the openness to a different solution, with Roma moving ahead, initiating initial discussions at the end of last month.\n\nNow, however, the matter has entered the heated phase. The formula is a loan with an option to buy set at €20 million, a proposal that Trigoria believes is sustainable and could satisfy both parties.\n\nAtlético, for their part, is pushing for conditions that would transform the option into an obligation, tying it to the player’s number of appearances. This is the final hurdle to unravel: once the right fit is found, the deal can truly take off.",

    "fullText": "It was telling Rob Edwards referenced the importance of his players showing more character during their home games in the build-up to Brentford.\n\nIn his eyes, Wolves' best performances since taking charge have come during away defeats at Aston Villa and Arsenal. Both were tight matches where you could argue, on another day, they could have earned a point.\n\nThe reality is draws won't get Wolves out of their current predicament. Wins, and I stress the plural, are the only way mere talk of survival isn't greeted with laughter.\n\nWe all know teams are more likely to win at home. However, we also quite often see struggling sides can feel more comfortable on the road.\n\nJorgen Strand-Larsen's missed penalty was a clear example of a player fighting against the 'weight' of the gold and black shirt. Four months ago Newcastle had bids of £50m and £55m for the striker rejected. In the here and now he has one Premier League goal to his name this season, ironically, a spot kick he managed to convert two months earlier against Burnley.\n\nThe limited confidence the Norwegian currently has will have been further eroded after he was mocked by some sections of the home support who chanted in anger following his failure to convert from 12 yards. Molineux at times felt like a roman colosseum, with bloodthirsty fans desperate for a scapegoat, even more so following the departure of Jeff Shi.\n\nAt the other end of the fan vitriol scale is Mateus Mane. At 18-years of age, with just a handful of Premier League appearances to his name, Edwards said to me post-match he clearly lacks the \"scars\" some of his older and more experienced team-mates are currently carrying.\n\nAfter coming on in the 65th minute, the academy product was always positive - not only willing to test defenders and showcase his skill set, he also chased down a lost cause down near the corner flag, which resulted in not only winning the ball back but his subsequent cross led to Wolves a chance.\n\nUnderstandably keen to impress, I was struck by the frequency in which he raised his hand to receive the ball. He wanted to make a difference, and it was his first-time delivery into the box which led to Wolves being awarded a penalty.\n\nIn stark contrast to the treatment dished out to Strand-Larsen, once the full-time whistle had blown, Mane stood and applauded the Sir Jack Haywood stand as the small number of fans still in their seats sang his name back to him.\n\nEdwards told me afterwards supporters can expect to see more of Mane in the coming weeks but Wolves will need much more than the innocence of youth if they want to fend off the inevitable comparisons to the infamous Derby County Premier League campaign of 2007-2008.",

    "fullText": "It has been nine months since Dani Alaves was acquitted on a charge of rape, having successful appealed the original verdict in February 2024. The former Barcelona defender, who recently reappeared as a preacher, is now said to be planning his return to football.\n\nDani Alves last played a professional match in January 2023, days before he was arrested on suspicion of rape following an incident that took place weeks prior. Pumas, his then-club, cancelled his contract upon the news, which means that he has not featured for almost three years.\n\nHowever, it has now been reported by ESPN Brazil (via Marca) that Alves intends to return to football as a player. The 42-year-old, who is still under investigation for rape after the Prosecutor’s Office filed an appeal against his acquitting, is close to purchasing Portuguese third tier side São João de Ver alongside a group of investors, and his plan is to register himself as one of their players once negotiations are finalised.\n\nAlves intends to “sign” for São João de Ver in January, and thus, play the second half of the season with his new club. He would then officially retire from football, before moving into a full-time role as owner.\n\nProvided that a deal is completed, Alves would follow in the footsteps of Vinicius by purchasing a Portuguese club. The Real Madrid man is an investor in the consortium that bought Alverca earlier this year, and the then-second division were promoted to the Liga Portugal at the end of last season.\n\nAlvera currently occupy a very respectable 10th place in the Liga Portugal, ahead of established clubs such as Rio Ave and Santa Clara. Alves will be hoping that he can lead his new club to similar heights in the coming years.",

    "fullText": "Is there any way this season can simply end?\n\nNo, there is not. The Washington Commanders will need to find a way to get through the final two games and see if they can get some players back healthy.\n\nQuarterback Marcus Mariota is battling with an injured quad and hand. Head coach Dan Quinn told the media on Sunday that they may even need to sign a quarterback to help them finish the season.\n\n\"It was [a] cleat that got to his hand on the top,\" Quinn said. \"But I don't know yet. It's swollen. I'd say we're going to, you know, call it day-to-day right now, of where it's at both with the hand and with the quad. And so, let's see what tomorrow is, and the following day. Then I'd say by two days from now, we'll have a very good estimate of where he is.\"\n\nThough Quinn didn't rule out needing to sign another quarterback, he did go ahead and rule out playing Jayden Daniels, the team's starting quarterback, in either of the final two games (Dallas, at Philadelphia). \"We would not consider playing Jayden. So, the first two options are the ones you were leading into of [QB] Josh [Johnson] and [QB] Sam [Hartman]. Would we consider somebody else coming in if he's not able to? Yeah, all those are on the table. That's something that [General Manager] Adam [Peters] and I are discussing tonight, and we did today. But yeah, option A and B, as you had said, but not C.\"\n\nJohnson is simply way beyond his best years, and Hartman? Did you see him in the preseason games? Yet, the Commanders chose to keep Hartman instead of looking elsewhere all season.\n\nQuinn certainly doesn't want to go out and sign a quarterback, bring him to Ashburn, and have him learn to play, if needed, in these final two weeks. You talk about difficult. It's difficult enough to find anyone who can play any position, but you actually think you might consider it for the final two weeks of an NFL regular season? Remember, this is a short week for Washington, which plays the Dallas Cowboys on Christmas Day [Thursday].\n\n\"I think it'd be difficult at any spot, but I think we're looking, let's see where Marcus is, where are we looking for the next two games too. So, that was really kind of our thought behind the discussions of where we are. I would say difficult, not impossible, but definitely difficult. I think we just saw somebody do it last week or two weeks ago pretty quickly. Not on our team [laughs], but I did see it happening. I was pretty impressed by it.\"\n\nYes, this is an NFL season many a Commanders fan might simply wish they could wake up and find this season had all been a bad dream... a really bad dream.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: Who will start at quarterback on Christmas Day?",

    "description": "A practical guide to installing Void Linux on an encrypted ZFS root with LUKS-encrypted swap and working hibernation support.",
    "fullText": "FreeBSD continues to make strides in desktop support, but Linux still holds an advantage in hardware compatibility. After running openSUSE Tumbleweed on my mini PC for several months, I decided it was time to switch to a solution I could control more closely. Not because Tumbleweed doesn't work well - it works great! - but I prefer having direct control over what happens on my machine. And I want native ZFS, because I prefer it over btrfs and it allows me to manage snapshots, backups, and rollbacks just as I do on FreeBSD, using the same tools and procedures.\n\nThe choice of Void Linux comes from its BSD-like approach: modular and free of unnecessary complexity. This makes it an excellent solution for this type of setup.\n\nZFSBootMenu is an extremely powerful tool. It provides an experience similar to FreeBSD's boot loader and natively supports ZFS. I strongly recommend reading the documentation and exploring its features, as some of them - like the built-in SSH daemon - can be genuine lifesavers in recovery scenarios.\n\nThis guide is not for absolute beginners. If you're new to Linux or Unix-like operating systems, you'd be better served by a ready-to-use distribution like openSUSE Leap (or Tumbleweed for a rolling distribution), Linux Mint, Debian, Ubuntu, or Manjaro. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate a stable, upgradeable, and reasonably secure base setup for users already comfortable with system administration. It uses the glibc variant of Void Linux. The musl version requires different commands, for example for locale generation.\n\nThis guide synthesizes instructions from several sources:\n\nIf your setup differs from what's described here (NVMe disk, UEFI boot, Secure Boot disabled), consult the linked guides for explanations and variations.\n\nIf you want to reproduce this setup quickly, I maintain a script that automates the procedure described in this guide: disk partitioning, ZFS pool and dataset creation, encrypted swap for hibernation resume, dracut configuration, and ZFSBootMenu EFI setup. An optional KDE Plasma desktop installation is also supported.\n\nThe script is interactive and will ask for the required parameters (target disk, timezone and keymap, passphrases, desktop options). Requirements, usage instructions, and known limitations are documented in the repository README\n\nThat said, I still recommend going through the manual process at least once. Understanding each step is part of the value of this setup, especially when troubleshooting or adapting it to different hardware.\n\nSince ZFS isn't supported by the base Void Linux image, we'll use hrmpf, an excellent rescue system based on Void Linux that includes ZFS support out of the box.\n\nAfter booting, you can either proceed directly or SSH into the machine to continue remotely. I generally prefer SSH since it makes copy-paste operations much easier - especially when dealing with UUIDs and long commands. To enable SSH access, set a root password and allow root login:\n\nEdit /etc/ssh/sshd_config and enable:\n\nYou can now connect via SSH from another device.\n\nSet up the environment variables and generate a host ID - we need it for ZFS:\n\nIdentify your target disk and set up the partition variables. This approach keeps everything consistent and reduces errors:\n\nVerify your configuration before proceeding:\n\nWarning: This operation will irreversibly destroy all data on the selected disk. Double-check that you've selected the correct disk and be sure to have a complete backup of your system!\n\nIf you're not using UEFI boot, adapt this procedure following the appropriate guide linked at the beginning of this post:\n\nThe swap partition should be slightly larger than your RAM to support hibernation. When you hibernate, the entire contents of RAM are written to swap, so you need enough space to hold it all plus some overhead. In this example, I have 16 GB of RAM, so I'm creating an 18 GB swap partition:\n\nEncrypting the disk is strongly recommended, especially for laptops. Replace SomeKeyphrase with a strong passphrase that's easy to type. Keep in mind that during early boot, the keyboard layout might default to US, so choose a passphrase that's easy to type on a US keyboard layout:\n\nCreate the pool with conservative, well-tested options:\n\nCopy the files we generated earlier to the new system:\n\nNow we'll set up the encrypted swap partition. This is where the hibernation magic happens - by using a separate LUKS-encrypted partition instead of a ZFS zvol, we can properly resume from hibernation.\n\nFormat the swap partition with LUKS:\n\nOpen the encrypted partition, create the swap filesystem, and activate it:\n\nBefore entering the chroot, save the disk variables so they remain available inside the new environment:\n\nFrom this point forward, all commands are executed inside the new system.\n\nFirst, load the saved variables:\n\nAdd the swap entry to /etc/fstab:\n\nTo avoid entering the swap password separately after unlocking the ZFS pool, we'll create a keyfile stored on the encrypted ZFS dataset. This is secure because the keyfile only becomes accessible after the ZFS pool is unlocked.\n\nFirst, install cryptsetup in the new system:\n\nGenerate a random keyfile and add it to the LUKS partition:\n\nAdd the keyfile to /etc/crypttab:\n\nInclude the keyfile and crypttab in the initramfs. Create /etc/dracut.conf.d/10-crypt.conf:\n\nConfigure keyboard layout and hardware clock. Adjust the keymap and timezone to match your location:\n\nNow we need to configure hibernation resume. This is the key insight that makes this setup work: normally, the encrypted ZFS root mounts first, and then it unlocks the swap partition. But when resuming from hibernation, the kernel needs to read the hibernation image from swap before mounting the root filesystem - otherwise, the saved state would be lost.\n\nTo solve this, we tell ZFSBootMenu to unlock the swap partition early, before mounting ZFS, by specifying its LUKS UUID.\n\nGet the UUID of your swap partition:\n\nStore the UUID in a variable for the next step:\n\nNow set the boot parameters using the captured UUID:\n\nCreate and mount the EFI partition:\n\nAdd the EFI partition to /etc/fstab using its UUID:\n\nConfigure the EFI boot entries:\n\nVoid Linux is modular, so you may need to install additional packages for your specific hardware. For the Intel microcode, you need the non-free repo: For example:\n\nAfter installing microcode updates, regenerate the boot images and exit:\n\nIf all you need is a minimal system or a server, you're done and ready to reboot. For a complete desktop environment, continue with the following steps.\n\nFor desktop use, create a non-root user with appropriate group memberships. Replace username with your desired username.\n\nxchroot will bind mount /etc/resolv.conf and leave an empty file. Network Manager won't like it. So let's clean it up:\n\nIf everything went well, after entering your ZFS encryption password, you'll be greeted by the SDDM login screen.\n\nTo verify that hibernation works correctly, you can clock the \"Hibernate\" button or:\n\nThe system should power off. When you turn it back on, ZFSBootMenu will prompt for the password, unlock the swap partition, detect the hibernation image, and resume your session exactly where you left off.\n\nIf resume fails, check that: 1. The LUKS UUID in the ZFS commandline property matches your swap partition 2. The swap partition is large enough for your RAM 3. The dracut configuration includes the crypttab and keyfile\n\nYou now have a fully functional Void Linux system with native ZFS, full disk encryption, and working hibernation. The system is rolling, lightweight, and easy to maintain. Enjoy!",

    "fullText": "Sonair has hit a major milestone: our ADAR firmware now compiles with the latest beta of Ferrocene, moving us closer to safety certification. This keeps us on track to deliver certified, high-performance sensing for autonomous robotics.\n\nSonair can now compile ADAR firmware using the 26.02.00 beta release of Ferrocene, Ferrous Systems’ certified rust compiler and subset of the Rust core library (libcore). Ferrocene 25.11.00 has already been assessed by TÜV SÜD for compliance with IEC 61508 (SIL2), and  26.02.00 (expected early 2026) will expand the certified subset of libcore, giving us all the functionality we need to formally certify our firmware.\n\nThe milestone means Sonair remains on track to achieve safety certification of ADAR.\n\nLibcore is the low‑level library that provides the fundamental “toolbox” Rust programmers build on, especially for no_std and embedded applications. Since libcore has a lot of functionality that will take time to be safety certified, Ferrous has certified a subset of libcore. The first release of a certified subset arrived in the beginning of December. It was still missing functionality we needed for our firmware. The coming version, however, will include everything Sonair needs to complete the job.\n\nWe’ve worked closely with Ferrous Systems in an iterative process to identify the functionality we need from the libcore toolbox and to test beta versions. Ferrous Systems has adopted new techniques that significantly speed up the process, enabling us to reach our deadlines. Sonair views libcore as the foundation of our software “tower.” Without a solid, certified foundation, even well‑designed upper layers might collapse under certification scrutiny or unexpected failure.",

    "fullText": "Japanese authorities have approved a decision to restart the world’s biggest nuclear power plant, which has sat dormant for more than a decade following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, in a pivotal moment as the country looks to looks to shift its energy supply away from fossil fuels.\n\nDespite nerves from many local residents, the Niigata prefectural assembly, home to the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant, approved a bill on Monday that clears the way for utility company Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) to restart one of the plant’s seven reactors.\n\nThe company plans to bring the No. 6 reactor back online around January 20, Japan’s public broadcaster NHK reported.\n\nJapan has taken a cautious approach to nuclear energy since a massive 9.0-magnitude earthquake and tsunami in 2011 triggered a nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. It was the world’s worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986.\n\nFollowing the disaster, Japan shut down all 54 of its nuclear power stations including Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, which sits in the coastal and port region of Niigata about 320 kilometers (200 miles) north of Tokyo on Japan’s main island of Honshu.\n\nJapan has since restarted 14 of the 33 nuclear reactors that remain operable, according to the World Nuclear Association.\n\nThe Niigata plant will be the first to reopen under the operation of TEPCO, the company that ran the Fukushima Daiichi power station. It has been trying to reassure residents of the restart plan is safe.\n\n“We remain firmly committed to never repeating such an accident and ensuring Niigata residents never experience anything similar,” said TEPCO spokesperson Masakatsu Takata, Reuters news agency reported.\n\nBefore the Fukushima disaster, Japan’s nuclear reactors had provided around 30% of the country’s electricity. Since then, Japan has increased its reliance on costly imported fossil fuels, including coal and gas, to power the country and keep the lights on.\n\nAbout 60–70% of Japan’s power generation comes from imported fossil fuels, which cost the country about 10.7 trillion yen ($68 billion) last year alone.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who took office two months ago, is a strong proponent of nuclear power and has pushed to revive the crippled industry to drive down costs, and tackle inflation and a stagnant economy.\n\nJapan is the world’s fifth-largest emitter of carbon dioxide, after China, the United States, India and Russia, according to the International Energy Agency. But it has committed to reaching net zero emissions by 2050, and renewable energy was at the center of its latest energy plan published earlier this year, with a push for greater investments in solar and wind.\n\nThe country’s energy demands are also expected to increase in the coming years due to a boom in energy-hungry data centers that power AI infrastructure.\n\nTo achieve its energy and climate goals, Japan aims to double the share of nuclear power in its electricity mix to 20% by 2040.\n\nBut the memory of the Fukushima disaster endures, and some local residents are wary of reviving nuclear power due to safety concerns.\n\n“We know firsthand the risk of a nuclear accident and cannot dismiss it,” Ayako Oga, 52, told Reuters. Oga had settled in Niigata after fleeing the Fukushima disaster. She told the news agency that her old home was inside the exclusion zone and she still struggles with post-traumatic stress-like symptoms.\n\nA survey published by the Niigata prefecture in October found 60% of residents did not think conditions for the restart had been met. Nearly 70% were worried about TEPCO operating the plant, Reuters reported.\n\nOn its website, TEPCO said Kashiwazaki-Kariwa had undergone multiple inspections and upgrades and that the company had learned “the lessons of Fukushima.”\n\nThe company said new seawalls and watertight doors would provide “stronger protection against tsunamis” and that mobile generators and more fire trucks would be on hand for “cooling support” in an emergency. It also said the plant now had “upgraded filtering systems designed to control the spread of radioactive materials.”\n\nIn late October, TEPCO conducted “a full round of integrity checks” at Unit 6 and declared the reactor fit for startup.",

    "title": "Expert: EU Commission wants an \"unlimited special legal zone\" for AI",
    "description": "In a legal analysis for consumer advocates, experts warn of massive protection gaps due to the planned \"digital EU omnibus\". Big Tech is favored.",
    "fullText": "With the planned \"digital omnibus\" package, the EU Commission promises a breakthrough against bureaucracy. However, resistance to the initiative is constantly growing. Legal experts from the law firm Spirit Legal are now urgently warning in an expert opinion commissioned by the Federation of German Consumer Organisations (vzbv) that the draft represents a systematic break with the principles of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and endangers the privacy of hundreds of millions of consumers.\n\nAt the center of the criticism is the planned Article 88c, which provides for special relief for data processing in the context of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The experts Peter Hense and David Wagner warn here of an \"unlimited special legal zone\". Since the term \"AI system\" is extremely broadly defined, companies could in the future declare almost any automated data processing as AI-relevant in order to evade strict data protection rules. This would replace the technology-neutral logic of the GDPR with a technology-specific privilege that primarily benefits service providers.\n\nThe lawyers consider the planned relaxation in handling sensitive data such as health information or political views to be alarming. The draft suggests that their processing is all the more justified the larger the data volumes are. This reverses the principle of data minimization: mass data extraction is rewarded as long as it serves to train AI models. The experts see this as dangerous privileges for Big Tech corporations.\n\nThe authors also criticize that essential protective mechanisms are merely shifted to the legally non-binding recitals. One example is technical opt-out procedures with which users can object to the use of their data. Without anchoring in the binding legal text, supervisory authorities lack the means to effectively sanction violations. Especially with web scraping, data of individuals would be collected who often have no opportunity to even become aware of their right of objection.\n\nTo counteract these negative developments, the experts propose a specific legal basis for AI training. Companies should only be allowed to access personal information if they can prove that their goal cannot be achieved with anonymized or synthetic data. Furthermore, it must be ensured that AI models do not reproduce personal information in their answers (\"Data Leakage\"). Strict technical standards are therefore necessary already in the training process.\n\nA chapter is dedicated to the protection of vulnerable groups. Since minors frequently cannot grasp the implications of data processing for AI, the authors advocate for explicit parental consent. In addition, individuals reaching the age of majority should receive an unconditional right to prohibit the further use of their data in existing models. Without such guardrails, the digital sovereignty of the next-generation risks being permanently lost.\n\nAccording to vzbv board member Ramona Pop, the political dimension of these findings is enormous. She warns that the Commission, under the guise of innovation, primarily wants to issue a free pass to US platforms. Big Tech could easily exploit legal grey areas, while European companies and consumers would be left behind. True legal certainty can only be achieved through clear rules. Brussels, on the other hand, is proposing vague exceptions that would have to be judicially clarified over years.\n\nCurrent results of a representative online survey for the vzbv demonstrate that data protection is not a hindrance but an economic factor. According to the survey, trust is the fundamental prerequisite for using digital services for 87 percent of consumers. The GDPR serves as an important anchor: over 60 percent of respondents are more likely to trust companies if they demonstrably comply with European regulations. A dilution of these standards thus also risks the social acceptance of new technologies.\n\nThe Digital Omnibus will now be discussed in the EU Council and Parliament. The objections from civil society can hardly be ignored. The package is suspected of being primarily the result of massive pressure from the US government, rather than representing European citizen and economic interests. The rights of data subjects are being weakened under the guise of \"simplifications,\" it is said. The Commission wants to issue AI companies a blank check to extract European data.\n\nDon't miss any news – Facebook,\n LinkedIn or\n Mastodon.\n\nThis article was originally published in\n\n German.\n\n It was translated with technical assistance and editorially reviewed before publication.",

It also warned that even if vulnerable configurations are removed, the firewall may still be at risk if a Branch Office VPN (BOVPN) to a static gateway peer is still configured.\n\n\"WatchGuard Fireware OS iked process contains an out of bounds write vulnerability in the OS iked process,\" an NVD advisory explains. \"This vulnerability may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code and affects both the mobile user VPN with IKEv2 and the branch office VPN using IKEv2 when configured with a dynamic gateway peer.\"\n\nWatchGuard has shared indicators of compromise to help customers identify compromised Firebox appliances on their network, advising those who find signs of malicious activity to rotate all locally stored secrets on vulnerable firewalls. It also provided a temporary workaround for network defenders who can't immediately patch vulnerable devices, requiring them to disable dynamic peer BOVPNs, add new firewall policies, and disable the default system policies that handle VPN traffic.\n\nOn Saturday, the Internet security watchdog group Shadowserver found over 124,658 unpatched Firebox instances exposed online, with 117,490 still exposed on Sunday.\n\n​One day after WatchGuard released patches, CISA added CVE-2025-14733 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog.\n\nThe U.S. cybersecurity agency also ordered Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies (executive branch non-military agencies, such as the Department of Energy, the Department of the Treasury, and the Department of Homeland Security) to patch Firebox firewalls within a week, by December 26th, as mandated by the Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01.\n\n\"This type of vulnerability is a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and poses significant risks to the federal enterprise,\" CISA warned. \"Apply mitigations per vendor instructions, follow applicable BOD 22-01 guidance for cloud services, or discontinue use of the product if mitigations are unavailable.\"\n\nIn September, WatchGuard patched an almost identical RCE vulnerability (CVE-2025-9242) impacting Firebox firewalls. One month later, Shadowserver found over 75,000 Firebox firewalls vulnerable to CVE-2025-9242 attacks, most in North America and Europe, with CISA later tagging the security flaw as actively exploited in the wild and ordering federal agencies to secure their Firebox appliances from ongoing attacks.\n\nTwo years ago, CISA also ordered U.S. government agencies to patch another actively exploited WatchGuard flaw (CVE-2022-23176) impacting Firebox and XTM firewall appliances.\n\nWatchGuard works with over 17,000 security resellers and service providers to protect the networks of more than 250,000 small and mid-sized companies worldwide.\n\nBroken IAM isn't just an IT problem - the impact ripples across your whole business.\n\nThis practical guide covers why traditional IAM practices fail to keep up with modern demands, examples of what \"good\" IAM looks like, and a simple checklist for building a scalable strategy.",

    "fullText": "THIBODAUX, La. (AP) — The teasing was relentless. Nude images of a 13-year-old girl and her friends, generated by artificial intelligence, were circulating on social media and had become the talk of a Louisiana middle school.\n\nThe girls begged for help, first from a school guidance counselor and then from a sheriff’s deputy assigned to their school. But the images were shared on Snapchat, an app that deletes messages seconds after they’re viewed, and the adults couldn’t find them. The principal had doubts they even existed.\n\nAmong the kids, the pictures were still spreading. When the 13-year-old girl stepped onto the Lafourche Parish school bus at the end of the day, a classmate was showing one of them to a friend.\n\n“That’s when I got angry,” the eighth grader recalled at her discipline hearing.\n\nFed up, she attacked a boy on the bus, inviting others to join her. She was kicked out of Sixth Ward Middle School for more than 10 weeks and sent to an alternative school. She said the boy whom she and her friends suspected of creating the images wasn’t sent to that alternative school with her. The 13-year-old girl’s attorneys allege he avoided school discipline altogether.\n\nWhen the sheriff's department looked into the case, they took the opposite actions. They charged two of the boys who'd been accused of sharing explicit images — and not the girl.\n\nThe Louisiana episode highlights the nightmarish potential of AI deepfakes. They can, and do, upend children's lives — at school, and at home. And while schools are working to address artificial intelligence in classroom instruction, they often have done little to prepare for what the new tech means for cyberbullying and harassment.\n\nOnce again, as kids increasingly use new tech to hurt one another, adults are behind the curve, said Sergio Alexander, a research associate at Texas Christian University focused on emerging technology.\n\n“When we ignore the digital harm, the only moment that becomes visible is when the victim finally breaks,” Alexander said.\n\nIn Lafourche Parish, the school district followed all its protocols for reporting misconduct, Superintendent Jarod Martin said in a statement. He said a “one-sided story” had been presented of the case that fails to illustrate its \"totality and complex nature.”\n\nA girl’s nightmare begins with rumors\n\nAfter hearing rumors about the nude images, the 13-year-old said she marched with two friends — one nearly in tears — to the guidance counselor around 7 a.m. on Aug. 26. The Associated Press isn’t naming her because she is a minor and because AP doesn’t normally name victims of sexual crimes.\n\nShe was there for moral support, not initially realizing there were images of her, too, according to testimony at her school disciplinary hearing.\n\nUltimately, the weeks-long investigation at the school in Thibodaux, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) southwest of New Orleans, uncovered AI-generated nude images of eight female middle school students and two adults, the district and sheriff's office said in a joint statement.\n\n“Full nudes with her face put on them” is how the girl’s father, Joseph Daniels, described them.\n\nUntil recently, it took some technical skill to make realistic deepfakes. Technology now makes it easy to pluck a photo off social media, “nudify” it and create a viral nightmare for an unsuspecting classmate.\n\nMost schools are “just kind of burying their heads in the sand, hoping that this isn’t happening,” said Sameer Hinduja, co-director of the Cyberbullying Research Center and professor of criminology at Florida Atlantic University.\n\nLafourche Parish School District was just starting to develop policies on artificial intelligence. The school-level AI guidance mainly addressed academics, according to documents provided through a records request. The district also hadn’t updated its training on cyberbullying to reflect the threat of AI-generated, sexually explicit images. The curriculum its schools used was from 2018.\n\nA school investigation hits obstacles\n\nAlthough the girls at Sixth Ward Middle School hadn’t seen the images firsthand, they heard about them from boys at school. Based on those conversations, the girls accused a classmate and two students from other schools of creating and spreading the nudes on Snapchat and possibly TikTok.\n\nThe principal, Danielle Coriell, said an investigation came up cold that day as no student took responsibility. The deputy assigned to the school searched social media for the images unsuccessfully, according to a recording of the disciplinary hearing.\n\n“I was led to believe that this was just hearsay and rumors,” the girl’s father said, recounting a conversation he had that morning with the school counselor.\n\nBut the girl was miserable, and a police incident report showed more girls were reporting that they were victims, too. The 13-year-old returned to the counselor in the afternoon, asking to call her father. She said she was refused.\n\nHer father says she sent a text message that said, “Dad,” and nothing else. They didn't talk. With the mocking unrelenting, the girl texted her sister, “It’s not getting handled.”\n\nAs the school day wound down, the principal was skeptical. At the disciplinary hearing, the girl’s attorney asked why the sheriff's deputy didn’t check the phone of the boy the girls were accusing and why he was allowed on the same bus as the girl.\n\n“Kids lie a lot,” responded Coriell, the principal. “They lie about all kinds of things. They blow lots of things out of proportion on a daily basis. In 17 years, they do it all the time. So to my knowledge, at 2 o’clock when I checked again, there were no pictures.”\n\nA fight breaks out on the school bus\n\nWhen the girl stepped onto the bus 15 minutes later, the boy was showing the AI-generated images to a friend. Fake nude images of her friends were visible on the boy’s phone, the girl said, a claim backed up by a photo taken on the bus. A video from the school bus showed at least a half-dozen students circulating the images, said Martin, the superintendent, at a school board meeting.\n\n“I went the whole day with getting bullied and getting made fun of about my body,” the girl said at her hearing. When she boarded the bus, she said, anger was building up.\n\nAfter seeing the boy and his phone, she slapped him, said Coriell, the principal. The boy shrugged off the slap, a video shows.\n\nShe hit him a second time. Then, the principal said, the girl asked aloud: “Why am I the only one doing this?” Two classmates hit the boy, the principal said, before the 13-year-old climbed over a seat and punched and stomped on him.\n\nVideo of the fight was posted on Facebook. “Overwhelming social media sentiment was one of outrage and a demand that the students involved in the fight be held accountable,” the district and sheriff’s office said in their joint statement released in November.\n\nThe girl had no past disciplinary problems, but she was assigned to an alternative school as the district moved to expel her for a full semester — 89 school days.\n\nIt was on the day of the girl’s disciplinary hearing, three weeks after the fight, that the first of the boys was charged.\n\nThe student was charged with 10 counts of unlawful dissemination of images created by artificial intelligence under a new Louisiana state law, part of a wave of such legislation around the country. A second boy was charged in December with identical charges, the sheriff's department said. Neither was identified by authorities because of their ages.\n\nThe girl would face no charges because of what the sheriff’s office described as the “totality of the circumstances.”\n\nAt the disciplinary hearing, the principal refused to answer questions from the girl’s attorneys about what kind of school discipline the boy would face.\n\nThe district said in a statement that federal student privacy laws prohibit it from discussing individual students’ disciplinary records. Gregory Miller, an attorney for the girl, said he has no knowledge of any school discipline for the classmate accused of sharing the images.\n\nUltimately, the panel expelled the 13-year-old. She wept, her father said.\n\n“She just felt like she was victimized multiple times — by the pictures and by the school not believing her and by them putting her on a bus and then expelling her for her actions,” he said in an interview.\n\nThe fallout sends a student off course\n\nAfter she was sent to the alternative school, the girl started skipping meals, her father said. Unable to concentrate, she completed none of the school's online work for several days before her father got her into therapy for depression and anxiety.\n\nNobody initially noticed when she stopped doing her assignments, her father said.\n\n“She kind of got left behind,” he said.\n\nHer attorneys appealed to the school board, and another hearing was scheduled for seven weeks later.\n\nFor students who are suspended or expelled, the impact can last years. They're more likely to be suspended again. They become disconnected from their classmates, and they’re more likely to become disengaged from school. They're more likely to have lower grades and lower graduation rates.\n\n“She’s already been out of school enough,” one of the girl's attorneys, Matt Ory, told the board on Nov. 5. “She is a victim.\n\n“She,” he repeated, “is a victim.”\n\nMartin, the superintendent, countered: “Sometimes in life we can be both victims and perpetrators.”\n\nBut the board was swayed. One member, Henry Lafont, said: “There are a lot of things in that video that I don’t like. But I’m also trying to put into perspective what she went through all day.” They allowed her to return to campus immediately. Her first day back at school was Nov. 7, although she will remain on probation until Jan. 29.\n\nThat means no dances, no sports and no extracurricular activities. She already missed out on basketball tryouts, meaning she won’t be able to play this season, her father said. He finds the situation “heartbreaking.”\n\n“I was hoping she would make great friends, they would go to the high school together and, you know, it’d keep everybody out of trouble on the right tracks,” her father said. “I think they ruined that.”\n\nThe Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

    "fullText": "BERLIN, Dec 22 (Reuters) - German car exports to the United States slumped by almost 14% in the first three ​quarters of 2025, making it the hardest-hit branch of German ‌industry in U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war, according to a study seen ‌by Reuters on Monday.\n\nUnder an agreement between Washington and Brussels, the U.S. set a 15% baseline tariff on cars from Europe from August 1 - significantly less than Trump's initial rate of 25% on top of ⁠a 2.5% existing levy.\n\nGerman ‌engineering companies have also struggled under the tariff regime, with the study showing exports in that sector ‍to the U.S. declining by 9.5% in the first nine months of 2025.\n\nMachinery exports are subject to a 50% U.S. tariff on steel and aluminium ​products.\n\nThe chemical industry also saw exports to the country's top export ‌market decline by 9.5%, although the report said this could not be blamed solely on tariffs.\n\n\"Other factors are likely to have played a role in the case of chemical products, such as lower production in Germany due to higher energy prices,\" it said.\n\nAcross all ⁠sectors, German exports to the U.S. ​were down 7.8% year on year over ​the three quarters - following average growth of nearly 5% in the comparable periods of 2016 to 2024.\n\n\"Since it ‍must currently be ⁠assumed that U.S. import tariffs will not return to pre-Trump administration levels in the foreseeable future, a significant recovery in German ⁠exports to the U.S. is unlikely,\" study author Samina Sultan said, referring to ‌a \"new normal\" for German exporters.",

    "title": "Why The B-52 Bomber Uses Eight Engines Instead Of Four",
    "description": "Most modern aircraft use four jet engines, but the B-52 bomber has eight. The reasons start in one frantic weekend its designers spent in the 1940s.",
    "fullText": "The B-52 Stratofortress carries eight engines for one simple reason: the technology of the 1940s, when it was designed, wasn't capable of powering it with anything less. Engineers didn't have much choice but to group eight of these early Pratt & Whitney J57s together in the plane's signature twin-pod configuration to achieve the massive thrust necessary to hoist a fully loaded bomber up to the high altitudes needed.\n\nWith modern technology, if the same plane were designed from scratch, it would require no more than four engines, much like what we see in the C-17 Globemaster or the B-1 Lancer or even the twin-engine design of America's next stealth bomber, the B-21. However, the B-52 is a relic of an earlier technological era.\n\nThis defining silhouette was not part of some sort of long-term master plan, but rather the result of a frantic weekend redesign spurred by a crisis in a Dayton, Ohio hotel room. Boeing's first conceptions, the Models 462 and 464, used huge Wright XT-35 turboprops rather than pure jets. The gas turbines were highly complex, though, and engineers were convinced that their propellers would lose efficiency at high speeds. Things came to a head in October, 1948 when Col. Henry \"Pete\" Warden of the Air Materiel Command urged Boeing engineers to once and for all drop the failing turboprop configuration. The team reworked the airframe over that single weekend, returning with Model 464-49, which finally paired the swept-wing design with the eight-engine turbojet layout we see today.\n\nThe Air Force has tried several times over the years to re-engine the B-52 with four high-bypass turbofans, similar to what one would find on commercial airliners. Proposals in 1969, 1980, and even a joint Boeing and Rolls-Royce pitch in 1996 aimed at the modernization of the bomber with drastically fewer engines. These proposals were continuously turned down because the switch would drive a snowball of engineering problems that outweigh any potential benefits.\n\nThere's the B-52's existing airframe, specifically the shorter tail fins and rudders on today's G and H models, which just can't handle the physics of a four-engine setup. The four-engine arrangement could create dangerous asymmetric thrust if one of four large engines were to flame out — the resultant yaw or twist could violently pull the nose toward the dead engine and make it impossible for a pilot to control the plane. The pilot would have to stomp on the rudder to keep the plane flying straight, but the current rudder doesn't have the surface area to fight that kind of drag.\n\nSo the plane would have to have major redesigns in the wings, cockpit, and engine struts, owing to different weight distribution and drag profiles. It would open a Pandora's box of structural risks and delays that the Air Force just isn't willing to touch.\n\nThis commitment to the legacy eight-engine configuration birthed the massive Commercial Engine Replacement Program, which will keep the B-52 flying alongside the next-generation B-21 Raider into the 2050s. In 2021, Rolls-Royce secured a $2.6-billion contract to replace the aged-out Pratt & Whitney TF33 engines with 650 F130 engines, a militarized BR725, on a one-for-one basis, preserving the eight-engine layout.\n\nThat replacement is not to boost the airplane's speed but to provide 30% better fuel efficiency and considerably cut maintenance needs. And the engineers aren't just guessing whether all of it will fit in. Boeing and Rolls-Royce are using \"digital twins\" — exact 3D models of the aircraft — to identify problems such as mismatched hydraulic lines or electrical disconnects before they ever touch a real plane.\n\nThe Boeing B-52 still retains its eight engines because replacing them would amount to breaking the very advantages that have kept it flying. By upgrading the propulsion system without changing its basic airframe architecture, the Air Force has made a wise decision that will help in keeping its oldest jet in the skies until it's 100 years old.\n\nWant more like this?

    "fullText": "TOKYO (AP) — Japan's space agency said its H3 rocket carrying a navigation satellite failed to put the payload into a planned orbit, a setback for the country's new flagship rocket and its space launch program.\n\nMonday's failure is the second for Japan's new flagship rocket after its botched 2023 debut flight and six successful flights.\n\nThe Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency said the H3 rocket carrying the Michibiki 5 satellite took off from the Tanegashima Space Center on a southwestern Japanese island Monday as part of Japan's plans to have a more precise location positioning system of its own.\n\nThe rocket's second-stage engine burn unexpectedly had a premature cutoff and a subsequent separation of the satellite from the rocket could not be confirmed, Masashi Okada, a JAXA executive and launch director, told a news conference.\n\nWhether the satellite was released into space or where it ended up is unknown, and that JAXA is investigating the data to determine the cause and other details, Okada said.\n\nJun Kondo, an official at the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, told reporters that the failure was “extremely regrettable” and that the government set up a task force to investigate the cause and take necessary measures as soon as possible to “regain credibility.”\n\nMonday's failure is a setback for Japan's new flagship that replaced the earlier mainstay H-2A which had near-perfect success record. It also delays Japan’s satellite launch plans, including one to have a more independent geolocation system for smartphones, maritime navigation and drones without relying on the U.S. GPS system.\n\nThe H3 rocket is designed to be more cost-competitive in the global space market. Japan sees a stable, commercially competitive space transport capability as key to its space program and national security.\n\nJAXA's H3 project manager, Makoto Arita, said the new flagship is still in the early stages of operation but can be globally competitive. “We will pull ourselves together so that we won't fall behind rivals. We'll fully investigate the cause and put H3 back on track.”\n\nMonday's launch came five days after JAXA aborted just 17 seconds before liftoff, citing an abnormality of a water spray system at the launch facility, following an earlier problem with the rocket.\n\nIn its debut flight in March 2023, H3 failed to ignite the second-stage engine.\n\nJapan currently has the quasi-zenith satellite system, or QZSS, with five satellites for a regional navigation system that first went into operation in 2018. The Michibiki 5 was to be the sixth of its network.\n\nJapan currently relies partially on American GPS and wants to have a seven-satellite network system by March 2026 and an 11-satellite network by the late 2030s.",

    "description": "Diameter Capital Partners made successful telecom and satellite bets as AI demand spread beyond chips.",
    "fullText": "The artificial intelligence boom is real — but there's more to the AI trade than chips alone, according to a credit investor.\n\n\"This is a super-duper micro cycle that will outlast many investing careers,\" said Scott Goodwin, the cofounder and managing partner of Diameter Capital Partners, a quote he attributed to his partner Jonathan Lewinsohn.\n\nAI represents what Diameter Capital sees as a long-running, disruptive cycle — but buying the most obvious winners isn't the only way to play it, he said on the \"Goldman Sachs Exchanges\" podcast published on Friday.\n\nDiameter Capital, which manages approximately $25 billion in assets, has focused on where AI demand could create less obvious bottlenecks — and where those bottlenecks show up in credit markets.\n\nThat view led Diameter to buy the unsecured debt of a midsize telecommunications company in 2023.\n\nGoodwin said the bet was rooted in the idea that as companies move from training AI models to actually using them, demand shifts away from chips alone and toward the networks that carry data.\n\n\"It had to leave the data center. How would it leave? It would leave on the commercial fiber, the pipes,\" he said.\n\nThe telco went on to sign more than $10 billion in contracts with hyperscale cloud providers, and the debt has rebounded to face value, Goodwin said.\n\nDiameter Capital also made \"a big bet\" on a satellite company tied to the wireless spectrum — a wager that later paid off after the company sold spectrum assets and the debt returned to face value.\n\nGoodwin's comments come amid growing debate over whether sky-high AI valuations are sustainable and whether investors are overlooking other opportunities tied to the technology.\n\nGoodwin warned that parts of the AI-credit boom may be taking on risk that's hard to price, especially in chip finance.\n\nSome investors, he said, are taking on \"residual risk,\" or the riskiest slice of chip-financing deals — betting on what the hardware might be worth years from now. Cutting-edge firms refresh their technology often, so chips can quickly become outdated for some customers.\n\n\"We call up really smart people in Silicon Valley, we call up really smart people at Big Tech companies and ask them what the residual value is on these chips three, four, five, six, seven years forward,\" he said. \"None of them have a clue.\"\n\nGoodwin said the next phase isn't just about spending on infrastructure — it's about competitive disruption rather than capital expenditure.\n\n\"Who are the companies, who are the entities that are going to adopt AI and take a step forward versus their peers? And who are going to be the losers?\" he asked.\n\n\"That is actually a longer cycle than the capex cycle, so that's really interesting,\" he said.",

I'm so happy, I can't explain it.\"",

    "fullText": "Unknown to most, Fikayo Tomori's full name is Oluwafikayomi Oluwadamilola Tomori.\n\nIn Milan, like in most places during his footballing career, they stick to calling him \"Fik\".\n\nBut the story behind Tomori's full name is worth telling.\n\n\"My parents are Nigerian so the names come from their tribes,\" Tomori tells BBC Sport.\n\n\"Each tribe has a sentence which is shortened to a name, so Oluwafikayomi means 'God has filled me with joy' and Oluwadamilola means 'God has filled me with wealth'.\n\nThis season, there is plenty of joy so far in Milan.\n\nUnder Massimiliano Allegri, AC Milan are second in Serie A, only one point behind Inter Milan and with eyes set on winning a first Scudetto since 2021-22.\n\nBack then, Milan ended an 11-year wait for the title. This season the Rossoneri have lost only once in the league.\n\nIt is a stark difference from last season, when they lost 11 matches and finished eight - their worst league finish in a decade.\n\n\"We all came back in the summer with a point to prove, individually and collectively. We have to attack the season and get back in the Champions League,\" says Tomori, who turned 28 last week.\n\nUnder Allegri, playing in a three-man defence has allowed the centre-half to thrive.\n\n\"Physically it's the best I've felt,\" Tomori says. \"Part of that is knowing where I have to be on the pitch. It's helped me a lot when it comes to reading the game.\n\n\"It's a simple thing, but there's no need to over-extend yourself as a defender. It's about running smarter, not harder.\"\n\nIt is nearly six years since Tomori, who grew up supporting Arsenal, made the leap and left Chelsea, where he came through the ranks. \"I wanted to stabilise my career,\" he says.\n\nTomori has made 194 appearances for Milan since and by now is fluent in Italian and completely immersed in the culture.\n\n\"The accent comes naturally too,\" he says. \"If I don't speak in the accent or switch it on, they won't understand.\n\n\"It's a different way of life, but the biggest difference is how we train. In Italy it's a lot more focus-based in terms of how we'll play, whereas in England training can be more physical and intense.\n\n\"When I was growing up there was a stereotype that English players didn't go abroad, but there's quite a few now, which shows we can go abroad and adapt to a different way of living too.\"",

Baltimore went on to lose 28-24, as Jackson did not return.\n\nHere's the latest on the Ravens' star quarterback's status.\n\nPatriots clinch playoff spot for first time since 2021\n\nHow Patriots wound up benefitting from missed DPI call on Marlon Humphrey\n\nRavens' path to the postseason gets bleaker with loss to Patriots\n\nJackson is dealing with a “bruise of some kind,\" head coach John Harbaugh said, and the Ravens are currently unsure of his status moving forward. Per Jeff Zrebiec, Harbaugh said he has no sense of how much time Jackson could miss with the injury, if any.\n\nJackson was been ruled out for the remainder of Sunday night's game with a back injury after initially being questionable. Tyler Huntley played the entire second half in his absence.\n\nRavens QB Lamar Jackson (back) has been ruled out for the rest of the game\n\n— Jamison Hensley (@jamisonhensley) December 22, 2025\n\nJackson appeared to take a knee to his back/rib area on a run against the Patriots in the second quarter. Soon after that play, the Ravens took a timeout, and Jackson exited for the sideline as he was replaced under center by Huntley.\n\nNow an injury for the #Ravens: Lamar Jackson is going to the locker room.\n\nTyler Huntley is in the game. Will have more updates when available.\n\nThis is what the broadcast showed: pic.twitter.com/oeSRGdLFQ4\n\n— Arye Pulli (@AryePulliNFL) December 22, 2025\n\nJackson was seen visibly frustrated when walking back to the locker room.\n\nThis was Lamar Jackson’s reaction as he went with #Ravens trainers to locker room before halftime #RavensFlockpic.twitter.com/ASrNwsT6FF\n\n— Jerry Coleman (@sportswcoleman) December 22, 2025\n\nOn the NBC broadcast, Jackson was said to have struggled going down the stairs and up the stairs to get into the locker room. His absence came right before halftime, allowing the Ravens some time to check on the quarterback and determine his status for the second half.\n\nHowever, Jackson remained sidelined when the Ravens offense took the field in the third quarter, and he never came back on the field as his team fell to 7-8 this season.\n\nPostgame, Huntley told reporters that Jackson was \"bummed\" about his injury and he could \"barely move.\"\n\nTyler Huntley on Lamar Jackson’s mood after being hurt: “He was bummed.

He was pulled from the game soon afterward, going to the locker room with what the team called a back injury.\n\nThe Ravens initially ruled him questionable to return, needing a win in the matchup to compete at the top of the AFC North. He didn't return to the game and was ruled out in the third quarter. John Harbaugh said postgame that Jackson was dealing with a \"bruise of some kind.\"\n\nHuntley, in his second career stint with the Ravens, is the team's backup quarterback. He entered for Jackson on Sunday night, taking over the offense. Coming into Week 16, Huntley had already made one start for Baltimore this season, going for 186 passing yards and a touchdown pass against the Bears.\n\nIn his career, Huntley has 3,040 passing yards and 733 rushing yards, at least somewhat of a dual-threat option for Baltimore behind Jackson.\n\nCooper Rush, the former Dallas Cowboys backup, is the QB3 in Baltimore, and the backup to Huntley if Jackson is out. Rush was designated as the team's emergency third quarterback in Week 16.",

It’s been a great experience here today and I don’t know what the future holds for me, but it was a special day for me and my family.”\n\n.@T_Hill4 on the past 9 years in New Orleans and what this city means to him pic.twitter.com/xSyUa2O99c\n\n— New Orleans Saints (@Saints) December 21, 2025\n\nHill restructured his contract last offseason, and there are no contractual ties to keep him in New Orleans beyond 2025. He started the year on the PUP list after having his 2024 campaign cut short by a significant knee injury that included a torn ACL, and it makes sense for a rebuilding Saints team to move in another direction.\n\n“I can tell you, I have so much love for the city of New Orleans and this fan base and the way that they’ve embraced me and my family,” Hill said.\n\n“It’s been really special. I wouldn’t want to play somewhere else, but there’s a lot of circumstances that are out of your control and I understand the nature of this business. I’m not thinking that way right now, but we’ll tackle that when we get there.”\n\n“This league talks about trying to find ‘Taysom Hills,’ but no one can duplicate it.”\n\nNew Orleans Saints coach Kellen Moore\n\nNew Orleans first-year coach Kellen Moore, who is Hill’s third head coach in his time with the Saints, shared what Hill has meant to the franchise.\n\n“This league talks about trying to find ‘Taysom Hills,’ but no one can duplicate it,” Moore said. “His ability to play every phase of the offense and contribute on special teams is really special.\n\n“He’s an A-plus person, an A-plus human being and an A-plus player.

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots had their backs against the wall in Sunday's game against the Baltimore Ravens. But there was no stopping quarterback Drake Maye and Mike Vrabel's Patriots under the primetime lights of Sunday Night Football.\n\nThe Patriots rallied from an 11-point deficit in the fourth quarter to knock off a desperate Ravens team on the road at M&T Bank Stadium in a 28-24 win.\n\nIt was an ugly game out of the gates with Maye committing two turnovers—an interception on the Patriots' first offensive drive and a fumble before halftime. The team also got smacked hard with the injury bug, with multiple key players going down, including rookie running back TreVeyon Henderson, who left with a head injury and never returned.\n\nBut the Patriots can't use the injury excuse in a game where Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson missed the entire second half due to a back injury. Ravens backup Tyler Huntley stepped up and filled in well enough to nearly hold off the Patriots.\n\nAnd then Maye burned the Ravens' defense over the top with a ridiculous 37-yard touchdown pass to rookie wide receiver Kyle Williams.\n\nOMG THIS IS BEAUTIFUL 😍\n\n.@DrakeMaye2 | @k_mmoneyyyy \n\n📺 NBC pic.twitter.com/qQpgUkN76K\n\n— New England Patriots (@Patriots) December 22, 2025\n\nThis game was the complete opposite of last week's loss to the Buffalo Bills with the Patriots starting slow and finishing strong against the Ravens.\n\nOn the ensuing offensive series, Maye led the Patriots down the field on a drive that was capped off by a 21-yard touchdown run by running back Rhamondre Stevenson to put New England ahead. It was a clutch drive that overcame one of the worst pass interference no-calls you will ever see.\n\nkayshon boutte; pass interference; patriots vs ravens pic.twitter.com/jiJUbu6Ns8\n\n— ◇ (@F0RGIAT0) December 22, 2025\n\nThe Patriots didn't play their best game, but it was still enough to get a win over a Huntley-led Ravens team on the road. Maye also showed the ability to put the team on his back and carry them across the finish line when the chips are down.\n\nAnd they were plenty down before the fourth quarter comeback on Sunday.\n\nMaye eclipsed 300 yards passing for the first time this season, finishing 31-of-44 for 380 passing yards and two touchdowns. It's another strong performance for the second-year quarterback to hang his helmet on.\n\nWith the win, the Patriots have now clinched a spot in the playoffs. They are also still in the race for the No. 1 seed in the AFC if they win out and the Denver Broncos lose another game. A road trip to MetLife Stadium to take on the New York Jets is next on the itinerary.\n\nFollow Patriots Wire on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Patriots Wire: Instant analysis of Patriots' comeback win to stun Ravens on the road",

    "description": "The Lakers are very short-handed right now, and they need to get healthier, as they have two big matchups in the coming days.",
    "fullText": "Over the last few days, the Los Angeles Lakers have suddenly become very short-handed. First, they lost Austin Reaves to a calf strain he suffered just over a week ago, and then starting center Deandre Ayton came down with elbow soreness and missed their last two games.\n\nThen, against the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday, they didn't have starting forward Rui Hachimura, who is dealing with a groin ailment. To make matters worse, Luka Doncic sustained a leg contusion during that game and was ruled out for the second half. Without so many key players, the Lakers had a huge lack of offensive firepower and lost 103-88 to the Clippers.\n\nHead coach JJ Redick said that he hopes Hachimura will be back after missing a total of only a few days.\n\nJJ Redick says Rui Hachimura, out tonight with a sore groin, started to feel discomfort in his hip in the UTA game. Redick says “the hope” is Hachimura is only out for 3-5 days\n\n— Dave McMenamin (@mcten) December 21, 2025\n\nHe also added that Ayton and Reaves are improving, although he didn't say whether either of them will play in the team's next game on Tuesday versus the Phoenix Suns.\n\nRedick added that Deandre Ayton (left elbow) and Austin Reaves (left calf) are both progressing and did not rule out either of them playing in PHX on Tuesday https://t.co/GeFicCsrlL\n\n— Dave McMenamin (@mcten) December 21, 2025\n\nThe Lakers have a marquee matchup coming up on Christmas Day versus Kevin Durant and the Houston Rockets, who are 17-8 and right behind the Lakers in fifth place in the Western Conference. Five days later, the Purple and Gold will host the Detroit Pistons, who have the Eastern Conference's best record at 22-6.\n\nNeedless to say, they will need to be somewhere close to full strength in order to defeat either team, let alone both of them.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: JJ Redick gives updates on Rui Hachimura, Austin Reaves, Deandre Ayton",

Texas outscored the Jackrabbits by five in the second quarter, hitting 47.1 percent from the field to keep a 33-24 lead at halftime.\n\nIn the third quarter, South Dakota State cut the Texas lead to eight, but Harmon foundBooker for an elbow jumper to keep the Longhorns ahead by 10 points.

    "fullText": "Underneath the black stairs at OGC Nice Football Club’s training ground, a colourful photo wall illustrates INEOS’ sporting ventures.\n\nThe men’s teams of Manchester United, Ligue 1 side Nice and Swiss outfit Lausanne-Sport are pictured celebrating, and an INEOS Grenadiers cyclist speeds past. INEOS Britannia, the boat for the America’s Cup, stands majestically. Eliud Kipchoge, sporting a white INEOS shirt, smiles as he becomes the first person to run a marathon in less than two hours, and Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One drivers George Russell and Kimi Antonelli walk side by side. Seven-time F1 world champion Lewis Hamilton, then also with Mercedes, perches atop an INEOS Grenadiers vehicle alongside Sir Jim Ratcliffe.\n\nBetween Ratcliffe and INEOS — the petrochemicals company he founded, co-owns and chairs — more than £2.5billion ($3.3bn) has been invested in the past eight years across sports including football, cycling, sailing and running, according to publicly available information.\n\nYet the interest in women’s sports seems practically non-existent.\n\nIn cycling, INEOS took control of Team Sky in April 2019 — now competing as INEOS Grenadiers — and was urged to start a women’s team by many, including the former head of the UCI, cycling’s world governing body, Brian Cookson. It never happened.\n\n“It’s a surefire miss,” one former professional cyclist tells The Athletic. “I’m baffled as to why Ratcliffe hasn’t done it.”\n\nIn F1, INEOS is a partner and one-third owner of Mercedes-AMG Petronas, which has a French driver, 21-year-old Doriane Pin, in the sport’s all-women F1 Academy series.\n\nRatcliffe has also backed women in leadership positions across the business side of INEOS.\n\nLynn Calder is chief executive of INEOS automotive, makers of the Grenadier 4×4, and Florence Bardot and Natalina Arena hold senior finance roles in the petrochemicals field. Fran Millar was made CEO of Team Sky, INEOS Grenadiers and INEOS’ former fashion business Belstaff, since bought by sportswear group Castore in August but in which INEOS retains an interest through a strategic investment agreed as part of that sale. Her successor was Kerry Byrne. But there are currently no female CEOs across INEOS’ sports interests.\n\nIn sailing, Ratcliffe’s daughters, Julia Ratcliffe and Romane Polli, were named godmothers of INEOS’ boat, Britannia, competing at the America’s Cup off Barcelona, Spain, last year and christened the boat by spraying Nyetimber English sparkling wine on the bow for good luck. INEOS, however, was not the title sponsor for last year’s women’s America’s Cup, the first of its kind.\n\nAfter INEOS bought a minority stake in Manchester United in 2024, Ratcliffe has always been forthright about where the women’s team lie among his priorities. “The men’s team make £800million, the women’s team cost £10m,” he told The Sunday Times in August 2024.\n\nRatcliffe has repeatedly said his focus has been on United’s men’s team because that is “what moves the needle”, as he told BBC Sport in March. “Of our £650million of income, £640m of that comes from the men’s team and £10m comes from the women’s team,” he added.\n\nUnited’s 2023-24 accounts show the club lost £130.7million ($174m at current rates) and the women’s team contributed £100,000 to that loss, around 0.08 per cent.\n\nRevenues in women’s elite sports, according to finance experts Deloitte, are predicted to have risen by 240 per cent from 2022 to 2025. The same firm forecasts global revenues to reach at least $2.35billion (£1.75bn) in 2025. The two highest revenue-generating sports are basketball and football/soccer, and, while this predicted growth does not extend to all disciplines, Deloitte has stated “the growth of women’s sport has continued to exceed expectations”.\n\nSo is INEOS’ apparent lack of interest in women’s sport purely commercially driven? On the INEOS ‘compass’, which the company states was devised by Ratcliffe “as a fun way of attempting to capture how INEOS works”, “kids and sport”, “fitness and health” and “do the right thing” are all in the “things we like” section.\n\nAnd when it launched its support for Kipchoge’s sub-two-hour marathon attempt in May 2019, Ratcliffe said: “We make six or seven billion dollars a year in profit, so what’s wrong with investing a bit of that in sport? On some good challenges, good people, try to inspire people? It’s good fun.”\n\nKipchoge, a member of the NN running team, which had a performance partnership with INEOS until it ended last week, was the athlete in the world most likely to stand any chance of running the marathon’s 26.2 miles in less than two hours. It is understandable INEOS backed a man in its pursuit of smashing such a significant human barrier.\n\nHowever, when three-time Olympic and five-time world champion Faith Kipyegon, who has the same coach as Kipchoge and is also a NN athlete, attempted in June this year to be the first woman to run a mile in under four minutes — a Nike-backed project called Breaking4 — INEOS was not publicly involved. Kipyegon missed the mark by 6.42 seconds.\n\nAs INEOS closes in on the two-year anniversary of its investment in United, The Athletic has spoken to people familiar with its sporting endeavours, many of whom will remain anonymous to protect relationships, about the firm’s approach to women’s sport and women athletes.\n\n“INEOS missed the boat,” is a phrase repeated by many.\n\nAn INEOS spokesperson said: “We are totally committed to supporting our female teams and athletes across all of our sports activities. This is most apparent in football, but also in our support for female cyclists and runners.”\n\nTeam Sky’s Bradley Wiggins, Chris Froome and Geraint Thomas dominated the Tour de France during the mid-2010s.\n\nWhen INEOS took over Team Sky in 2019, it inherited an imperious operation led by Sir Dave Brailsford, who left British Cycling in 2014 after overseeing unprecedented success for men and women at World Championship and Olympic level. It also inherited a team facing questions about whether it had crossed the line in its dominance on the road.\n\nIn 2017, an independent review of British Cycling’s culture from 2012-16 was published, reporting that the “environment was one which some female riders… found uncomfortable” and there were “failings in British Cycling’s governance and leadership”. In February of that year, ahead of the review, Brailsford wrote in The Times that the team was “medallist, not sexist”.\n\nMillar told magazine Rouleur in 2021 that, after the 2012 Olympics in London, she and rider Lizzie Deignan (then Armitstead) raised the prospect of starting a women’s team “at every board meeting” for Team Sky. Some argued a women’s team was not warranted, given the struggling financial landscape of women’s cycling but by the late 2010s and early 2020s, several major men’s teams such as Visma-Lease a Bike, Lidl-Trek and Movistar, which still exist today, had launched women’s teams. Paris-Roubaix started a women’s race in 2021, won by Deignan riding for Trek-Segafredo, and the Tour de France Femmes was revived in 2022.\n\nHowever, INEOS, Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe, Team Bahrain Victorious, Decathlon–AG2R La Mondiale and XDS-Astana still have only men’s outfits.\n\nIn 2018, Natascha Knaven-den Ouden and her husband Servais Knaven, Team Sky’s sports director, set up APB, an under-19 women’s development team with six riders. Along with a French junior men’s team, APB’s women cycled with Team Sky’s pro riders on part of the cobbled Paris-Roubaix course ahead of the main event — for men only — in 2018.\n\nIn a Team Sky video from the time, Brailsford says: “When you’re a team like Team Sky at the highest level, what can you do for younger riders in the sport? Try to inspire. It’s something they and we’ll remember, something for the sport; just enjoyable. Without the fundamentals, the clubs, the youngsters in the sport, we have nothing.”\n\nAt the 2018 Belgian Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, Knaven-den Ouden recalls Team Sky allowing APB riders to see first-hand how a team operates from the inside. They stayed, she says, in the same hotel as Team Sky, had dinner with the men’s riders and staff and were part of the support team on race day, holding wheels and water bottles on the side of the road. And from then until the end of 2020, Team Sky and then INEOS gave APB riders equipment, such as wheels, chains, bike bags and cool boxes.\n\nKnaven-den Ouden then set up an under-23 women’s team, which became a UCI continental team called NXTG Racing. In February 2021, NXTG CEO Marion de Cocq says she sent a proposal via email to INEOS. The vision was to set up a continental team, using NXTG Racing’s under-23s as a feeder, which would cost an estimated €1.5million for the first year — about three per cent of the INEOS men’s team’s €45m (£39.4m/$52.7m at the current rates) budget.\n\n“We need partners who think outside of the box, who want to innovate and pioneer,” it read, according to two people who have seen the email. “Together with INEOS, we can create history in cycling.”\n\nKnaven-den Ouden and De Cocq say they never received a reply. INEOS declined to comment.\n\nThere were other opportunities to invest in women’s cycling, however.\n\nIn November 2022, INEOS signed France’s reigning mountain bike and gravel world champion Pauline Ferrand-Prevot on a two-year contract. She had gold at the 2024 Paris Olympics in her sights, which she duly won, but INEOS did not build a team around Ferrand-Prevot, who then returned to road racing, signed for Visma-Lease A Bike and won the 2025 Tour de France Femmes.\n\n“They’ve given so many young British men a start in the sport at that level,” says the same former professional cyclist quoted earlier in this article. “They really have the opportunity to lift up women’s cycling in Britain in the same way. They signed quality male cyclists, but are only going to sign the top woman ever.”\n\nINEOS has two women among 65 staff members on the racing side, and 12 of 85 overall when including administrative personnel. Visma-Lease A Bike, Ferrand-Prevot’s new team, has 29 female staff overall.\n\nThe same former professional cyclist described INEOS as a “men’s’ club” with an “old-school, blokey mentality” that is “palpable” around the cycling paddock. “It wouldn’t be a welcoming place for a female team unless they have the staff dedicated to making a concerted shift in the culture,” was the person’s verdict.\n\nThe America’s Cup is the oldest international sports competition, and one the British entrant has not won since 1851.\n\nRatcliffe, though, loves a challenge and invested in INEOS’ Britannia’s campaigns in the 36th and 37th America’s Cups in 2021 and 2024, led by team principal and skipper Sir Ben Ainslie. Its financial accounts detail a total of £226.5million of sponsorship income from 2019 to 2024, though there were other sponsorship sources besides INEOS.\n\nIn order to compete in the 2024 America’s Cup, each team had to supply a women’s and youth team for their respective regattas.\n\nBritain entered under the name Athena Pathway, part of Ainslie’s Athena Sports Group, which was set up in 2022 by the world’s most successful Olympic sailors, Ainslie and Hannah Mills. The programme gives women and younger sailors, male and female, more opportunities in high-performance sailing and tries to increase diversity in the sport.\n\nThe women’s edition was the first in history but Athena Pathway had no involvement with or sponsorship from INEOS. Instead, it was sponsored by Cobham-Ultra, an innovator in aerospace and maritime technology. By contrast, Italy, France, Switzerland, New Zealand and the United States all sponsored their men’s, women’s and youth teams in their respective regattas.\n\nINEOS’ website proudly details how INEOS Britannia “made history as the first British team in 60 years to reach the Cup Match, the first in 90 years to score points, and the first ever to win the Challenger Series — marking Britain’s most successful campaign”. Athena Pathway women’s team, led by Mills, also made history by advancing to the final, narrowly finishing second in a single match-race shootout, while the youth team finished third.\n\nIn April this year, INEOS Britannia withdrew its challenge for the next America’s Cup in 2027, saying its decision was due to “protracted negotiations” with Athena Racing.\n\nSpeaking to The Athletic in April, Ainslie said: “We competed under Athena Pathway and part of the Athena Sports Group. We had some other sponsors, that were fantastic, who came in to back them (the women’s team). It’s not for me to comment on INEOS’ approach.”\n\nOn the football front, as well as being co-owners of Manchester United, INEOS has owned Swiss club Lausanne since 2017 and French side Nice since 2019. All three have women’s teams, and the latter two sport INEOS’ logo on their shirts.\n\nIn November 2023, Nice’s former general manager Jean-Luc Donati told local newspaper Nice-Matin there were more registered girls than boys in their youth sector. His goal was for the senior women’s team to one day reach the top flight too, and stay there. In the 2023-24 season, Nice’s women finished fourth in the French second division.\n\nIn French football, clubs are associations and the vast majority have just one commercial entity, usually the men’s team. The rest, such as the men’s academy, women’s team and football school fall under the management of the association. They do not tend to generate enough revenue to sustain costs and so require funding from the men’s side to support them.\n\nThe men’s first-team budget at Nice is estimated to be around €80million (£70m; $93.7m) per year. Before the 2024-25 season, the women’s team’s annual budget was around €1.4m. INEOS reduced that figure to €1m, and its support has been capped at €350,000 per year. Also ahead of that same 2024-25 campaign, around 10 players and former head coach Matthieu Esposito’s assistant and physios left the club, followed by Esposito himself in February.\n\nBefore that season, the French Football Federation introduced new rules to professionalise the women’s second division and stated teams must have a minimum of 11 players under federal contracts, similar to professional contracts, with working hours at least equal to part-time. If not, a club could be fined €1,250 per match.\n\nLast season, Nice, according to French media, only had three players on such contracts, the lowest in the league. Some teams in division three had more players on federal contracts than they did.\n\nNice managed to avoid relegation by two points, finishing ninth, last season. They sit in the same position in this campaign.\n\nLausanne’s women play in the third division and are the only club in the men’s elite competition not to have a women’s team in Switzerland’s top two divisions.\n\nIn November, an article on the club website detailed how the youth team ran laps around a pitch and raised 20,000 Swiss francs (around £18,800; $25,100) to support the women’s development section. The money, the report stated, will be used to pay for bus travel, team meals and a training camp, as well as team-building activities.\n\n“INEOS does not really show it wants to have a truly successful women’s team,” says Florian Paccaud, a sports journalist covering women’s football in Switzerland.\n\nAt Manchester United, over two years, INEOS has injected £238.5million into the club, excluding the cost of buying shares.\n\nThe women’s team’s total expenditure from the 2022-23 and 2023-24 seasons was £16million, as per club accounts. That is slightly inferior to Manchester City (£18m) and dwarfed by the outlay at Arsenal (£26m) and Chelsea (£33m).\n\nDr Christina Philippou, associate professor in sport finance at the University of Portsmouth, thinks INEOS is missing a trick by not investing \n\n“There’s still a lot of potential money coming in,” says Philippou. “If you invest, there is potential for money to keep coming your way.\n\n“If you don’t invest now, and others are willing to, that can be very problematic for your brand. You can fall away pretty quickly. Just because you have a big name in men’s football does not mean you will be thought of from a brand and commercial perspective if your women’s team is not competitive. That is the problem with not investing… If you don’t invest now, you could miss the boat for quite a few years.”\n\nBut, for some, women’s football is also a corporate social responsibility project or a positive PR move, and old-school perceptions remain.\n\n“You can’t remove the sexism angle,” says Philippou, talking generally about the attitude to investment in women’s football in the UK. “There is definitely an element of that, and you see it a lot with how women’s sport is still viewed by executives, fans and media.”\n\nA major organisation such as INEOS could significantly influence the culture of women’s sport — if it wanted to. “They’ll be on the wrong side of history if they don’t,” says the ex-pro cyclist.\n\nThe overwhelming sentiment expressed by many is that 73-year-old Ratcliffe and key decision-makers are from a past generation, one in which women’s professional sport did not exist in anything like the same way it does today. Ratcliffe, Andrew Currie, John Reece, Jonathan Ginns and Simon Morland form an all-male board at INEOS Limited, the parent company which sits at the top of the sprawling INEOS group. The board’s average age is 60.\n\nINEOS says it has a number of female CEOs and CEO-level executives, but they are on the petrochemicals side of the organisation. When asked who sits on the INEOS sports board alongside CEO Jean-Claude Blanc, it said it does not publish details of individual board members.\n\nINEOS’ sporting success on the men’s side has also been mixed, despite the huge investment.\n\nRatcliffe remarked in March, via BBC Sport, that Manchester United’s women’s team “are frankly doing better than the men’s team”, pointing to their second-place league position at the time and 2024 FA Cup final win, while a sale of Nice is being explored, as reported in May.\n\nKipchoge’s feat was historic, but INEOS ended its NN running team partnership and also withdrew from the America’s Cup challenge, having split with Ainslie in January. INEOS Grenadiers are in decline, registering their worst performance at the Tour de France since 2010 this summer, and INEOS settled a sponsorship dispute with New Zealand Rugby (NZR) in April, and another case with Tottenham Hotspur of the Premier League last month.\n\n“Five years ago, they could have done a lot,” says one observer with experience in the field. “Now… most people would say, ‘Focus on what you have, because you’re not doing very well’.”\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nManchester United, Premier League, Ligue 1, Sports Business, Women's Soccer, Global Sports, Cycling\n\n2025 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "NFL power rankings: Seahawks edge Patriots for new No. 1; Jaguars, Bears also rise; Packers fade for Week 17 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nRanking all 32 teams in the NFL from best to worst for every week in the 2025 regular season has been a wild ride. With such a top-heavy league, the hierarchy can see a big change based on a few particular results.\n\nThat has often caused teams to jump high or fade fast in relation to the others near the top. Even the back end has seen some significant reshuffling of late.\n\nHere's Sporting News' latest breakdown from the tippy top to rock bottom coming out of Week 16:\n\nMORE: Updated AFC, NFC playoff picture after Week 16 results\n\nThe Seahawks won that thriller over the Rams with the offense rebounding after a slow passing start. They need Sam Darnold to cut down on the mistakes and keep raising the big plays to live up to their lofty playoff position.\n\nThe Patriots went into more of an offensive slump in Baltimore with Drake Maye cooling and being contained again, putting their chances of stealing the AFC East in serious jeopardy.\n\nMORE: Patriots clinch playoff spot for first time since 2021\n\nThe Rams had no problems moving the ball without Davante Adams with Matthew Stafford spreading the ball around and getting more from the running game. But the secondary issues in Seattle became more prevalent when the front cannot get pressure.\n\nThe Broncos couldn't find enough clean offense from Bo Nix to make another fourth-quarter comeback in what looked more like a blowout loss to the Jaguars. Their defense, having key lapses, is a shaky late development.\n\nThe Jaguars had their true statement victory in Denver, making six straight wins. Their road domination and finishing well in the fourth quarter bodes well for their playoff profile.\n\nMORE: 6 reasons why Jaguars are legitimate Super Bowl contenders\n\nThe Bears should be thrilled to have the late-game comeback mode of Caleb Williams, always giving them a chance. Chicago is pushing toward being a tough out in the playoffs.\n\nMORE: Bears take control of NFC North with win over Packers\n\nThe Bills were caught in a tough battle down the road in Cleveland as Josh Allen's clunker against a tough defense was saved by James Cook and the running game. The defense was fortunate to face a team with limited weapons to survive\n\nThe Chargers went into Dallas and used it for a get-well offensive game with more juice from their defense, too. Justin Herbert needed that and so did Jim Harbaugh.\n\nThe 49ers should have loved the fact that the Seahawks took down the Rams on Thursday night. Their offense is red-hot and a win over the Colts would give them control of the division in the final two weeks.\n\nThe Eagles have got their offensive groove back with Saquon Barkley running well and Jalen Hurts' passing efficiently everywhere to silence the critics. They don't need to worry about the division anymore and can focus on getting into top shape for their Super Bowl defense in the playoffs.\n\nThe Packers saw Jordan Love get concussed in Chicago with Malik Willis playing well enough to win, but had too many offensive, defensive and special teams lapses to create a bigger mess than injuries.\n\nThe Texans were able to hold off the Raiders with resilient offense and just enough of their trademark defense. The hiccup is excusable with a win, but much must be fixed before facing the Chargers next week.\n\nMORE: Texans keep playoff hopes alive by escaping with win over Raiders\n\nThe Steelers found their running game again in Detroit to balance out the stellar run defense. They keep getting better at the right time to get into the playoffs on an uptick with Aaron Rodgers.\n\nThe Lions have been struggling to run the ball at will like they did last season and taking that element away, as the Steelers did. That and an injury-depleted defense have been the downfall for Detroit as a playoff contender.\n\nThe Panthers showed a lot of moxie in outlasting the Buccaneers with Bryce Young winning the biggest passing duel of his career. They have a great shot at making some noise should they get into the NFC playoffs.\n\nMORE: Panthers take control of NFC South with massive win over Buccaneers\n\nThe Colts will try to do more with a game Philip Rivers on Monday night against the 49ers with their season on the line, but the defense also may not oblige in a tough spot.\n\nThe Ravens had another defensive meltdown and other fourth-quarter big mistakes to blow another big lead, this time vs. the Patriots, spelling doom for a bad overall season, now maybe with Lamar Jackson not finishing healthy.\n\nMORE: Ravens' path to the postseason gets bleaker with loss to Patriots\n\nThe Buccaneers are making too many mistakes late in games, from the defense to Baker Mayfield. They can still get into the playoffs but there will be less inspiration for them to last long against a tough wild-card draw.\n\nThe Vikings can't seem to keep J.J. McCarthy healthy right when he builds positive momentum, but they still grounded out another win with enough clutch plays and more needed tough defense against what was a promising Giants offense.\n\nThe Cowboys look like they're running out of gas offensively to keep trying to make up for historically horrible all-around defense. This disappointment can't be blamed on Dak Prescott.\n\nThe Falcons are working to finish strong with wins over the Buccaneers and Cardinals making them feel better about the future of Raheem Morris as head coach. Credit Morris for getting them to be inspired with nothing left on the line.\n\nThe Chiefs can't be expected to win with their defense not having a pass rush and their offense not having a passing game minus Patrick Mahomes, Gardner Minshew and their top wide receiver. The fact they lost so easily on the road to the Titans is just so shocking.\n\nMORE: How Travis Kelce's retirement decision is easy with no Patrick Mahomes\n\nThe Saints took care of the lesser Jets at home with Tyler Shough chucking well with help from diverse weapons under Kellen Moore. He should go into Year 2 as the starting QB and the defense is also playing with a lot of late conviction.\n\nThe Bengals showed almost no life in Week 15 against the Ravens but got up off the mat to rip an overmatched and lesser-motivated Dolphins team with Joe Burrow needing that get-well performance late to try to end the season on a positive.\n\nThe Dolphins have faded fast from their rally back into playoff contention with dismal performances against the Steelers and Bengals in consecutive losses. Mike McDaniel can feel the heat again with the Tua Tagovailoa benching backfiring.\n\nThe Commanders just haven't fielded enough reliable defense all season long, with their age and youth showing in all the wrong places. They will just hope everything will change again with a healthy Jayden Daniels leading the offense.\n\nThe Titans are seeing a much-improved Cam Ward in recent weeks and it added up to a nice confidence-building win against the reeling Chiefs at home.\n\nThe Browns fought hard against the Bills with Shedeur Sanders showing the kind of fight and play that gets him a full-season audition as the starter in 2026 despite the defense falling apart around Myles Garrett.\n\nMORE: Myles Garrett inches closer to NFL sack record with obscure half sack\n\nThe Cardinals' positive offensive vibes have hit a wall with Jacoby Brissett and the rest of their backups, who have had too much pressure to compensate for a Jonathan Gannon potential lame-duck defense.\n\nThe Jets did their best to stay competitive with Brady Cook starting again at quarterback but the bigger problem is Aaron Glenn's shell of an overall defense. They are a really lost, bad team.\n\nMORE: Updated NFL draft order after Week 16\n\nJaxson Dart was due for a clunker and the Vikings' defense delivered it to him. The lumps have been there enough to go forward with a new coaching system all-around.\n\nThe Raiders showed more life with their offense in of all places, Houston against the Texans' nasty defense. They also played their most inspired defensive game in weeks. It still wasn't enough to overcome their lack of execution.",

    "description": "’Twas the last night at Delta Center, and the Utah Mammoth played Winnipeg on the Sabbath.",
    "fullText": "’Twas the last night at Delta Center, and the Utah Mammoth played Winnipeg on the Sabbath.\n\nNot a player was scoring — except Clayton Keller, whose overtime goal was so good it even surprised Tusky the Mammoth.\n\nTHE CAPTAIN GETS IT DONE 🫡\n\nClayton Keller scores the winner in @Energizer overtime! pic.twitter.com/lwC8no1aOM\n\nComing away with a 4-3 overtime win against the Winnipeg Jets, Keller and the Utah Mammoth delivered the best gift a Mammoth fan could ask for — an exciting overtime win at home ahead of the Christmas break.\n\nBut perhaps Dylan Guenther was the one who gave the best gift during this game, as he opted to give the puck up to Keller rather than take a shot of his own despite it having an open look.\n\n\"Me and Gunner [Guenther] actually chatted before overtime started,\" said Keller. \"He was like, let's come with a lot of speed and, you know, I think that was something that was in my head as I came on the ice.\"\n\nAdditionally, Guenther gave Keller a new record, as he recorded the fastest goal in Utah Mammoth history, scoring just 13 seconds into overtime and overtaking Lawson Crouse’s previous mark of 16 seconds against the Kraken on April 8.\n\nKnowing Guenther’s success — he has scored a game-winning goal in 19 of his 186 NHL games — it would have come as no surprise if he elected to shoot the puck himself. He was coming in with plenty of speed on a 2-on-1 and was in a great position to shoot.\n\nThat’s just it, though. Everyone in the stands, Jets goalie Connor Hellebuyck and maybe even the Utah bench was thinking Guenther would take the shot.\n\nSo rather than trying to add another overtime game-winner under his belt — specifically his fourth of the season had he scored the goal— Guenther made the smart play and passed the puck to a wide-open Keller.\n\n\"You cannot teach that. You just make the right play,\" said André Tourigny. \"If we will have odds to know 'Does he shoot that puck?,' the entire building will have said he will have [shot] it. The goalie probably thought the same. That's why he passed it.\"\n\nIt may have looked a bit different for Guenther, but the result was the same: The Utah Mammoth got a win, thanks in part to his play.\n\nGuenther is sure to be happy adding an overtime game-winning assist to his résumé, especially if it meant giving his captain a game-winner of his own.\n\nIt is the season of giving, after all.\n\nNo lead is safe in the NHL, and Utah knows that very well thanks to its last overtime win — a 5-4 victory against the Penguins in which Utah came back from three goals down. Fittingly, Guenther scored the overtime goal in that game.\n\nBut in this game, it was Winnipeg fighting for a comeback, not the Mammoth.\n\nDown 3-0 just three minutes into the second period, the Jets were struggling to keep the Mammoth away from their own net. Every attempt to clear the puck was met by a Utah player’s stick jarring it loose, leading to long shifts in the offensive zone and even a couple of goals going the Mammoth's way.\n\nJJ makes it 2-0! Way to play, fellas! 🔥 pic.twitter.com/WNqRQZRJlW\n\n— Utah Mammoth (@utahmammoth) December 22, 2025\n\nTo make matters worse, three of Utah’s four lines found themselves getting the puck into the back of the net, including fourth-liner Alexander Kerfoot, who scored in just his second game back from injury after missing Utah's first 36 games.\n\nThe Mammoth were scoring at will, and it didn’t matter who was on the ice. But just as things were beginning to look bleak, the Jets dug deeper and began to play harder.\n\nAt first, it started with just a couple of hard hits when Utah entered its offensive zone. Rather than letting Utah make any pass it wanted, Winnipeg upped its physicality and forced Utah to endure big hits.\n\nIt was a small change, but it showed the Jets were done allowing the Mammoth easy access to the net. Thanks to that physicality, Winnipeg eventually generated some offense of its own and drew a Utah penalty, with Kyle Connor scoring on the power play.\n\nMr. 300 goals 🚨🍗 pic.twitter.com/8sefqxqLmO\n\n— Winnipeg Jets (@NHLJets) December 22, 2025\n\nThe Jets had a long way to go, but they were able to cut Utah’s lead to 3-1 entering the third period and gained a bit of momentum.\n\nThough Utah played good defense for most of the third, Winnipeg struck, scoring two goals in just 25 seconds to tie the game 3-3, prompting a timeout from Tourigny.\n\nBANG BANG TO TIE IT ‼️ pic.twitter.com/emiOSlGi5P\n\n— Winnipeg Jets (@NHLJets) December 22, 2025\n\nWhile Keller eventually won the game for the Mammoth in overtime, it still allowed a division rival, fighting for a playoff spot, to snag a point it shouldn't have had.\n\n\"I think our third (period) there is obviously not great,\" said Keller. \"We still have to make plays, even if we're winning. Whatever the score is, they're gonna make a push. That's something that we've talked about and tried to get better at... I think that's something that we have to learn from and do moving forward.\"\n\nBut just like the Whos down in Whoville, Utah will still celebrate the win at the end of the day, even if it comes in overtime and the Grinch has already stolen the last can of Who hash.\n\nAre we sure Alexander Kerfoot has only played two games for the Mammoth? Because his performance against the Jets showed no signs of rust.\n\nAlready, in just his second game, Kerfoot’s time on ice has gone drastically up — from 8:14 against New Jersey the game prior to 13:49 — and he certainly deserves it if he’s going to keep scoring goals on the fourth line.\n\nBack like he never left! 👏\n\n🚨 Kerfy makes it 3-0, Mammoth! pic.twitter.com/3mA0oqkkkS\n\n— Utah Mammoth (@utahmammoth) December 22, 2025\n\n\"He’s such a great player. He can play anywhere in the lineup. He’s a great leader, someone that we missed when he was out. Just all the little things that he does on the bench, during the game, in the locker room. I can’t say enough great things about Kerf and how good of a person he is and player as well,\" said Keller. \"It's awesome getting him back. We definitely have had more juice since he's been back.\"\n\nConsidering how much the Mammoth relied on Kerfoot last year when dealing with injuries, it makes sense that Utah immediately had chemistry with him.\n\nBut in addition to his chemistry, Kerfoot is invaluable for Utah’s penalty kill. Against the Jets, he was already back to his disruptive ways, blocking shots and sending pucks back to Hellebuyck throughout the game.\n\nThe Mammoth were already the sixth-best penalty-kill unit in the league, killing 83% of opponent power plays before his return to the lineup. Imagine what Utah will be able to do now that he’s back in the lineup.",

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots are back in the win column thanks to a 28-24 win over the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday night. The victory, which helped New England secure a spot in the NFL playoffs for the first time since 2021, was hard-earned and saw the team overcome an 11-point deficit in the early fourth quarter.\n\nHere is a Patriots-centric view at some of the key moments of the game.\n\nDerrick Henry's 117th career rushing TD!\n\nNEvsBAL on NBC\nStream on @NFLPlus + Peacock pic.twitter.com/63luTxitUR\n\nThe Patriots defense couldn’t stop a nose bleed in the second half against the Buffalo Bills last Sunday, and things did not start any better against the Ravens. After receiving the opening kickoff, it took Baltimore only five plays to cover 65 yards and find the end zone on a 21-yard untouched Derrick Henry touchdown.\n\nMarlon Humphrey picks off Drake Maye!\n\nNEvsBAL on NBC\nStream on @NFLPlus + Peacock pic.twitter.com/8HQQe2GUE8\n\nLike the Ravens, the Patriots had some success on their opening possession. However, while they managed to drive into the Baltimore red zone their series found a quick and disappointing end: facing a 3rd-and-14, Drake Maye escaped the pocket to his right only to throw an interception to cornerback Marlon Humphrey with wide receiver Kayshon Boutte in the vicinity.\n\nHawkins knocks the ball loose from Henry for the turnover\n\nNEvsBAL on NBC\nStream on @NFLPlus + Peacock pic.twitter.com/dEZa8NZFCG\n\nAfter registering just three takeaways in their last six games, New England’s defense was able to get a big one in the late first quarter. While trying to fight for extra yards, Ravens running back Derrick Henry got the ball punched out on a gang tackle by Jaylinn Hawkins and Carlton Davis. Fellow Patriots DB Craig Woodson fell onto the ball for the recovery, preventing Baltimore from potentially going up by multiple scores.\n\nMaye to Henry to tie it up!\n\nNEvsBAL on NBC\nStream on @NFLPlus + Peacock pic.twitter.com/e2kloG2JrQ\n\nThe Patriots took full advantage of their fumble recovery, driving down the field in 10 plays to score their first points of the night.

However, just like the first of those opportunities, New England came up empty-handed: Drake Maye was sacked from behind, coughing the ball up in the process. The Ravens fell on the fumble for their second takeaway of the game.\n\nThe Patriots fake punt cannot convert!\n\nNEvsBAL on NBC\nStream on @NFLPlus + Peacock pic.twitter.com/FN6q20LMae\n\nFacing a 4th-and-10 down four points in the late third quarter, and with the Ravens down to their backup quarterback, the Patriots decided to make a head-scratching decision. Instead of punting the ball, they ran a fake with personal protector Marte Mapu trying to execute a pass. However, the play was doomed from the start and Mapu eventually unable to salvage it. Seven plays later, the Ravens scored a touchdown to go up 24-13.\n\nDRAKE MAYE TO KYLE WILLIAMS.\n\nNEvsBAL on NBC\nStream on @NFLPlus + Peacock pic.twitter.com/ToEf565k29\n\nDown 11 points, the Patriots were in dire need of some offensive momentum. They found it in the form of a big touchdown pass from Drake Maye to Kyle Williams. New England’s quarterback hit the rookie down the right sideline for a 36-yard score. While not the most actively-involved member of the team’s wide receiver group, Williams has now caught three touchdowns on the season and is averaging 30 yards per catch. For Maye, meanwhile, the score put him over 300 yards in a game for the first time in his career.\n\nWhen the Patriots took over with 5:02 left in the game, they were still down three points. While that meant a field goal would tie the game, they had their sights set on victory. And a big fourth-down catch by wide receiver Stefon Diggs helped them accomplish that goal.\n\nMaye. Diggs. 4th down. Clutch.\n\nNEvsBAL on NBC\nStream on @NFLPlus + Peacock pic.twitter.com/6qywqsJnCi\n\nDiggs’ 21-yard gain on 4th-and-2 proved to be pivotal moment for the Patriots.

Stevenson finished the game with eight carries for 51 yards, and also found the end zone twice: first on a two-point conversion after the Kyle Williams TD, and then on a 21-yard run to put New England up by four just outside the two-minute warning.\n\nCHAISSON FORCES THE FUMBLE.\n\nNEvsBAL on NBC\nStream on @NFLPlus + Peacock pic.twitter.com/k1qFLyors9\n\nThe Patriots defense collapsed in the second half against Buffalo last Sunday, but they held firm versus the Ravens. Tasked with preserving a four-point lead inside the two-minute warning, the unit delivered: on one of the better hustle plays you will see, K’Lavon Chaisson turned from pass rusher to pursuit player to force a Zay Flowers fumble that was recovered by Marcus Jones, giving the Patriots the ball and a chance to run out the clock.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIn most league formats, the fantasy football playoffs start in Week 16. For the quarterback position, all starters are in play -- for better or worse.\n\nWell, except for Patrick Mahomes, who suffered a season-ending torn ACL as the Chiefs' playoff hopes for this season also ended.\n\nLuckily, in most fantasy games, quarterback replacements from the waiver wire at least have a high weekly floor compared to other positions, and Mahomes managers have plenty of replacements.\n\n➕ UPGRADE YOUR PLAYOFF TOOLS: \nThese Week 17 quarterback rankings are based on 4-point passing touchdowns and one point for every 25 passing yards.\n\n↕️ Fantasy Rankings for Week 17\n\n📋 BEST PLAYOFF PICKUPS: Week 17 waiver wire guide\n\nThe Ravens' Lamar Jackson (back) left Sunday Night Football with a back injury, replaced by Tyler Huntley.\n\nJordan Love (concussion) was replaced by Malik Willis during the Packers' Saturday night loss to the rival Bears.\n\nJ.J. McCarthy (hand) might need season-ending surgery, leaving the Vikings to be stuck with potentially another Max Brosmer experiment.\n\nMarcus Mariota (throwing hand/quadriceps) day-to-day for the Commanders, leaving the definition of \"journeyman\" Josh Johnson as a possible replacement with Jayden Daniels (elbow) already shut down for the season.\n\nThe Chiefs fear that Gardner Minshew suffered some type of season-ending knee injury. With Patrick Mahomes (torn ACL) already done for the year, that leaves Chris Oladokun as a possibility to take snaps while Kansas City plays out the string on its lost season.\n\nWho's left? Trevor Lawrence has etched his name into the \"breakout star\" list from this season, who heading into his three-touchdown Week 16 hadn't finished lower than QB13 in his previous six outings -- including back-to-back QB1 overall finishes before Sunday.\n\nThe magical Liam Coen potion has revitalized another lost quarterback at the best possible time for fantasy players.\n\nThat being said, Lawrence sits behind Drake Maye and Matthew Stafford, who thrived even with Davante Adams (hamstring) on the sidelines.\n\n🐐 See where Trevor Lawrence ranks among QBs: Who has the most fantasy points in a game?\n\nWhile calling them \"sleepers\" is a stretch, the fact that every healthy QB is available shouldn't keep us from giving these names a boost:\n\nWith the surging 49ers' full cast of characters healthy, Brock Purdy is a strong top-5 option against a Bears secondary that caught a break with Jordan Love's injury Saturday. That defensive backfield will wilt against San Francisco's cadre of pass-catchers.\n\nKeep rolling out Joe Burrow (vs. Cardinals) and Dak Prescott (at Commanders), despite both teams' elimination from postseason contention.\n\nThe Buccaneers' Baker Mayfield should rebound after a tough draw against the Panthers against a Dolphins defense that won't contain Mike Evans and co.\n\nTyler Shough (at Titans), Kirk Cousins (vs. Rams), and even Quinn Ewers (vs. Buccaneers) deserve superflex/2QB matchup consideration, too, especially if you've lost Mahomes or Daniels recently and/or could face more injury woes with any of the handful in jeopardy.\n\nNEW - FANTASY TOOLS: NFL Player Stats | NFL Transactions | NFL Depth Charts | Fantasy Injury Reports\n\nWe're not keen on taking any of the top 13 quarterbacks out of lineups, but if you're streaming, Sam Darnold could fall short of QB1 expectations against a Panthers defense that can contain top quarterbacks.\n\nSame goes for Justin Herbert, who must deal with the Texans' elite pass defense.\n\nThe NFL has no more weekly byes for the 2025 regular season.

    "fullText": "Before leaving the game with a back injury late in the second quarter, Lamar Jackson appeared on his way to a strong outing. Jackson had completed 7-of-10 passes for 101 yards and made multiple off-script throws after buying time in the pocket. He connected with Zay Flowers for several long gains through the air and one of his three incompletions was a dropped pass. In Jackson’s relief, Tyler Huntley did a respectable job in the second half, leading consecutive touchdown drives at one point. Huntley completed all but one of his 10 pass attempts but only threw for 65 yards, with two yards on the ground.\n\nDerrick Henry’s lost fumble late in the first quarter was an early negative turning point, as it killed the Ravens’ momentum. They ultimately rebounded enough to take a double-digit lead later in the game. Henry had already rushed for a touchdown and 51 yards before fumbling and rumbled for more production after the blemish. He finished with 128 rushing yards in total on 18 carries with two touchdowns. Henry was strangely on the sidelines for the final two drives of the game despite dominating in the third quarter. It was quiet night from the rest of the running back room. Keaton Mitchell gained only 13 yards on nine carries while Rasheen Ali had two catches for two yards.\n\nFlowers did just about everything right all game until his final touch of the night, where he lost a fumble with just under two minutes remaining. The Ravens may not have driven down the field and scored a go-ahead touchdown anyways, but Flowers’ fumble sealed the fate of a loss. In total, Flowers finished with seven catches for 84 yards and added an 18-yard rushing touchdown in the third quarter. He made big catches and moved the sticks but the fumble, which has been his achilles heal, is a costly blemish. Deandre Hopkins had a strong performance with four receptions for 41 yards with multiple third-down contested catches to extend drives. Rashod Bateman was once again blanked on both his targets and Devontez Walker was not targeted.\n\nMark Andrews was a minimal factor in the passing game again with just two catches for 21 yards. He almost had a costly turnover as well with a head-scratching lateral pass attempt before halftime. It was ruled an illegal forward throw, which prevented a fumble that would have given the Patriots the ball in scoring range. Charlie Kolar had a nice 18-yard grab and Isaiah Likely was surprisingly not a factor with no targets. The tight ends collectively made a positive impact in run blocking and helped create some lanes for Henry.\n\nAside from some frustrating false start penalties on the same drive, the Ravens’ offensive line appeared to have one of their better games in recent weeks. Jackson was not sacked in the first half and Huntley was sacked only once across several drives. The Patriots managed five quarterback hits, but Baltimore’s pass protection was pretty solid. In run blocking, they drove open lanes for Henry all night and also helped create space for Flowers to find the end zone on his 18-yard end-around touchdown. As a team, the Ravens finished with 171 rushing yards and three touchdowns while averaging 5.2 yards per carry.\n\nThe Ravens’ defensive line was stout against the run for nearly the entire game, before Rhamondre Stevenson broke them down with a pair of long rushes late in the fourth quarter. Stevenson’s 21-yard touchdown and 11-yard first down pickup were back-breakers. Drake Maye and Treyveon Henderson were otherwise contained on the ground. In terms of pass rush, the Ravens’ defensive front did very little to get pressure through the interior on Maye. Travis Jones had one quarterback hit, but there was a lack of noticeable push up front.\n\nSpeaking of a lack of pass rush, that issue extends outside to the edge rushers as well. The final numbers of four sacks and 10 quarterback hits look good on paper, but too often Maye had clean pockets and plenty of time to throw for multiple plays in a row. Dre’Mont Jones had another solid showing with a timely sack and two quarterback hits, and Kyle Van Noy broke up a pass attempt that would have been a touchdown catch. The Ravens’ edge rushers deserve some credit for playing solid run defense for much of the game, but they badly needed more juice and disruption.\n\nRoquan Smith recorded a team-high 10 tackles and, along with Trenton Simpson, made some plays against the run. Smith’s lack of splash plays, however, is disappointing when considering his prominent role. Simpson had a sack and two tackles-for-loss in a starting role with Teddye Buchanan (knee) out for the rest of the year. The former third-round pick had a nice open-field tackle against Henderson. The Patriots were able to complete some longer throws over the middle of the field above the heads of the linebackers. Their tight ends Hunter Henry and Austin Hooper combined for eight catches and 69 yards with a touchdown.\n\nMarlon Humphrey’s night started off well after he corralled an interception on the Patriots’ opening drive of the game. From there on out, his performance went downhill. Humphrey was beat for a long touchdown in single coverage of Kyle Williams, which gave the Patriots much-needed life in the fourth quarter. He also ceded several catches to Stefon Diggs as the primary defender and should have been called for defensive pass interference on a long pass attempt to Keyshon Boutte late. Nate Wiggins had two pass breakups and nearly came up with a huge interception late in the game. He timed a break on a slant route perfectly but could not pull down the ball, which would have given the Ravens the ball back with the lead and a few minutes remaining. The Ravens surely would have liked to have had the services of Chidobe Awuzie, who was inactive with a foot injury.\n\nAlohi Gilman had an up-and-down night, as he was victimized by some missed open-field tackles but also finished with eight total and a pass breakup as well. Kyle Hamilton had a strong tackle-for-loss to prevent a long Henderson run and a pass breakup of his own, too. Ar’Darius Washington was party to one of the defensive plays of the game, where he forced a fumble on Maye just before halftime. That prevented the Patriots from getting a field goal or touchdown and taking a lead into the break. Washington finished with two quarterback hits, a sack, and a tackle-for-loss. He was beaten by Diggs in coverage on a key fourth-and-short pass late in the game. Malaki Starks had three solo tackles on the night.\n\nThe play of the game on special teams was the Ravens dismantling a fake punt attempt by the Patriots late in the third quarter, which was defended nicely by Devontez Walker. It wasn’t a great night for the unit aside from that moment. Tyler Loop was well short on a 56-yard attempt in the second quarter while making his other try and all three extra points. Jordan Stout’s two punts went for 40 and 45 yards, respectively.",

    "description": "It took overtime to get it done, but the Mammoth move into a playoff spot after their 4-3 win over the Jets.",
    "fullText": "If the Utah Mammoth make the playoffs this season, it’s incredibly likely that the Winnipeg Jets don’t — and vice versa.\n\nFor that reason, their matchup on Sunday was among the more important games either team will play this year. The Mammoth pulled off the win, but it took the skin of their teeth to get it done. Here’s the story.\n\nWhen the Mammoth took a 3-0 lead 23 minutes in, it looked like they’d waltz away with a regulation win against the Jets for the second time this season.\n\nBut hockey is a 60-minute game. It doesn’t end when one team takes a three-goal lead.\n\nKyle Connor began the Jets’ comeback with a power play goal midway through the second period. He doubled up with a nearly identical tally late in the third, and 15 seconds later, Morgan Barron struck to tie the game.\n\n“We would have loved to close the game right there. I think we got a little bit nervous,” said Mammoth head coach André Tourigny. “We lost our composure with the puck. I often say there’s two (important things) when you’re protecting a lead: Having poise with the puck ... and to have a lot of pace defensively, which is our strength.\n\n“... We became a little bit too conservative and they were able to come back.”\n\nIf there’s one aspect of Utah’s game that strikes fear into opponents, though, it’s when Dylan Guenther has the puck in overtime.\n\nHe’s tied for the league lead in both overtime goals and game-winning goals this season, and he finished in the top six in both categories last year.\n\nOn Sunday, it was his passing that made him a threat.\n\nGuenther collected the puck in the defensive zone, dipsy-doodled around his man in the neutral zone and found Clayton Keller in the offensive zone.\n\nAll it took was a perfectly placed shot for the captain to net the OT winner.\n\nCLAYTON KELLER OT FIST BUMPS! pic.twitter.com/1XAZqc8kdk\n\n— Utah Mammoth (@utahmammoth) December 22, 2025\n\nUtah winning in regulation prevents the other team from getting a point in the standings, so given the tightness of the playoff race the Mammoth would have liked to get it done earlier, but this was their second-best outcome.\n\n“Utah brings out the worst in us,” said Jets head coach Scott Arniel after the game. “That’s a bad start by everybody, and it just got us behind the 8-ball and then we’re chasing the game.”\n\nOf course, some of Arniel’s greatest success came in Utah: He won the Turner Cup while playing for the Utah Grizzlies in 1996.\n\nAfter returning from the first long-term injury of his NHL career last Friday, there was a question mark regarding how quickly Alexander Kerfoot would be able to get back to his old self.\n\nHe’d played the second-fewest minutes on the team against the New Jersey Devils on Friday and he hadn’t participated in a single proper practice this season until Saturday.\n\nNobody would have blamed him for taking a few games to get his stride back, but he didn’t waste any time.\n\nKerfoot scored on Sunday, sneaking behind the Jets’ defenseman and sending a perfect one-timer past Connor Hellebuyck, who’s widely considered the best goalie in the world.\n\nAdditionally, Kerfoot played a perfect 1:39 on the penalty kill and increased his ice time by more than five and a half minutes game over game.\n\nBack like he never left! 👏\n\n🚨 Kerfy makes it 3-0, Mammoth! pic.twitter.com/3mA0oqkkkS\n\n— Utah Mammoth (@utahmammoth) December 22, 2025\n\n“He’s such a great player,” Keller said of Kerfoot. “He can play up and down the lineup. He’s a great leader. Something that we missed while he was out, like, just all the little things that he does on the bench, during the game, in the locker room, like, I can’t say enough great things about Kerf and how good of a person he is — and player as well.\"\n\nFor the second time in his NHL career, Sean Durzi is on a five-game point streak. He also has six points in his last seven games.\n\nHe’s done it quietly, though: a goal here, an assist there. Utah’s second power play unit, which he quarterbacks, has shown vast improvement in recent weeks and for the most part, Durzi has been good defensively, too.\n\nTourigny chalked it up to good chemistry between Durzi and his defense partner, Mikhail Sergachev, who added a pair of assists on Sunday for eight points in his last 10 games.\n\n“Durz, every game, makes really good plays,” Tourigny said. “He needs to keep improving his consistency. The upside is there. The fact he missed a lot of hockey two seasons in a row, sometimes can affect his consistency.\n\n“That said, lately he’s getting better every game, so we like that.”\n\nEvery good team has a reliable top defense pairing that’s capable of playing big minutes while keeping the puck out of their net and contributing frequent offense. If Durzi and Sergachev can keep this type of play up over long stretches, the Mammoth will be in a good position going forward.\n\nOn a night when Sidney Crosby passed Mario Lemieux for most points in Pittsburgh Penguins franchise history, Kyle Connor won’t get as many flowers as he otherwise might, so we’ll give him some here.\n\nConnor scored career goals number 300 and 301 on Sunday, and they’ve all come in a Jets uniform. He trails only Mark Scheifele and Ilya Kovalchuk for most goals in franchise history, and he’s second in that category since the franchise’s move to Winnipeg.\n\nOn the league-wide all-time list, he jumped active San Jose Sharks forward Tyler Toffoli and tied himself with Ulf Dahlen for 239th place, and at age 29, he has plenty of time left to soar much higher.\n\nAlso, he’s the second-fastest American to reach the 300-goal plateau.\n\n“Pretty cool milestone,” Connor said after the game. “Once you look back on your career, that’s the kind of stuff you’ll remember, but right now, it’s focusing on winning and trying to be the best player I can and help out, so it doesn’t really mean much right now.”\n\nAt this point last season, Lawson Crouse had six goals and nine points. This year, he’s at nine and 15, respectively — a pace much closer to what his norm from Arizona.\n\n“I think probably my mindset,” he said when asked what the difference between the two seasons is. “Trying not to let little things bother me, try to be a little bit easier on myself, and I think that’s been paying off.”\n\nWhat a shot from the Sheriff! 🤠\n\n1-0, Utah! pic.twitter.com/CsNxm4M7S7\n\n— Utah Mammoth (@utahmammoth) December 22, 2025",

    "fullText": "The Patriots celebrated a crucial victory on “Sunday Night Football,” defeating the Baltimore Ravens 28-24. This win not only secured New England a playoff spot but also boosted quarterback Drake Maye’s standing in the MVP race.\n\nMaye threw for 380 yards, completing two touchdowns and one interception. As of Monday, FanDuel listed Maye with the second-best odds to win the MVP at +170, just behind Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford, who is at -195.\n\nStafford and the Rams lost to the Seattle Seahawks on Thursday. However, the defeat wasn’t due to Stafford’s performance, as he threw for an impressive 457 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nMaye still has a shot at winning MVP, but he’ll need Stafford to struggle in the next couple of weeks. Los Angeles will face the Atlanta Falcons and the Arizona Cardinals during that time, both of which are teams already eliminated from postseason contention, which could make it hard for Stafford to struggle.\n\nMaye will have an opportunity to improve his stats when the Patriots play against the New York Jets and the Miami Dolphins the next two weeks.\n\nEven if Maye doesn’t win the MVP this season, he will likely have a chance to earn the award in the coming years if he keeps up his impressive performance.\n\nMike Vrabel Gives Honest Reaction To Patriots’ Playoff-Clinching Win",

    "description": "How is early voting looking for Andruw Jones and the Hall of Fame?",
    "fullText": "With the week of Christmas here, many of the top free agents in baseball remained unsigned. This includes some of the best starting pitching arms, including Framber Valdez, Zac Gallen, Ranger Suarez, and Tatsuya Imai. While this development is not entirely surprising, the timing of when signings could occur now becomes a bit harder to predict, especially with the holidays over the next two weeks.\n\nThe Braves likely remain involved in many of the conversations focusing on adding a starting pitcher. And with the added bonus of not having traded away any prospects to feel their offseason needs, they could always pivot to the trade market as well. The good thing is that many avenues remain available for the Braves to strengthen their already strong rotation, even if it could into the new year when the move finally occurs.\n\nWe are less than away from the 2026 MLB Hall of Fame class being announced, which currently is scheduled for 01/20/2026/. In the very early going, Andruw Jones and Carlos Beltran are at the top of the class in votes. Both are at 78% per Ryan Thibodaux’s vote tracking on BlueSky. While this should be taking with a grain of salt with less than 10% of the votes known, it is an encouraging start.\n\nMunetaka Murakami signed a two-year, $34M deal with the Chicago White Sox. With his deadline to sign happening Monday, Murakami found a home in Chicago that he hopes can lead to a bigger deal down the road.\n\nThe Blue Jays are the latest team to reportedly have interest in Alex Bregman.",

    "fullText": "Bayern Munich returned to winning ways yesterday, claiming an emphatic 4-0 away win over Heidenheim with Harry Kane putting the gloss on proceedings, bagging the final goal in 90+2.\n\nThe England international missed some big chances earlier but eventually netted to take his tally of goals in 2025 for club and country to 60.\n\nHe has registered 30 goals in 25 appearances this season.\n\nKane has now tallied 19 goals and three assists in the Bundesliga this season, taking him to 100 goal contributions (81G & 19A) in only 78 appearances, becoming the fastest player to do so.\n\nHe has surpassed the record previously held by Bayern legend Arjen Robben, who took 119 games to reach the 100-mark tally.\n\nInterestingly, Kane also captained Bayern in the absence of Manuel Neuer and Joshua Kimmich, jumping ahead of the queue for the armband due to his leadership qualities.\n\nNo one has more goal contributions than the Bayern ace in Europe’s top five leagues in the past three seasons.\n\nKane has continued to break record after record in Germany. Just weeks ago, he became the fastest player to reach 10 hat-tricks, achieving it after just 76 Bundesliga appearances.\n\nIt took the great Robert Lewandowski 324 games to tally that figure.\n\nKane looks set to spearhead Bayern to another Bundesliga crown, and Die Rekordmeister will have one eye on the UEFA Champions League title.\n\nWith the mercurial Englishman leading the line, they can claim that elusive seventh Champions League crown.\n\nElsewhere, England boss Thomas Tuchel will be hoping the 32-year-old can avoid any serious injuries and carry this form till the end of the season.\n\nThe Three Lions head to the 2026 World Cup at the end of the season as one of the favourites for the title, and Kane will be key to their chances of success.\n\nHe has been excellent under Tuchel, and the German tactician will be banking on the former Tottenham Hotspur star to fire England over the line.",

    "description": "Former England forward Wayne Rooney hails Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice as a \"future captain of England\".",
    "fullText": "Former England striker Wayne Rooney has hailed Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice as a \"future captain\" of the Three Lions after watching the 26-year-old help the Gunners return to the top of the Premier League with victory at Everton.\n\nRooney, who captained England for three years from 2014 to 2017, was at the Hill Dickinson Stadium to see Mikel Arteta's side secure a scrappy 1-0 win on Saturday evening.\n\nRice, who has won 72 caps at senior international level, has worn the armband twice before in the absence of current skipper Harry Kane – in a 2-2 draw with Belgium in March 2024 and a 3-0 win over Wales in October this year.\n\n\"For me, he's the one who's probably waiting for Harry to hang up his boots at some point,\" Rooney said in the latest episode of BBC Sport's The Wayne Rooney Show.\n\n\"He was all over the pitch [against Everton]. His decision-making – when to pass it, where to pass it, what foot to pass it to, his detail on his pass – it was a pleasure to watch. He was absolutely incredible.\n\n\"He was splitting centre-backs, taking the ball off [Arsenal's] centre-backs, acting as a third centre-back, then next minute he's in the box, trying to score a goal. Sometimes, some of the stuff he does is a bit underrated.\n\n\"He's the right one to take over [Kane] for me, because [of] his drive, his personality. Everyone seems to love him, who knows him, who's close to him. He's irreplaceable for England.\"\n\nAfter a difficult start to his Leeds United career, Rooney's former Everton team-mate Dominic Calvert-Lewin has hit a purple patch in recent weeks.\n\nThe 28-year-old had scored just once in 10 league appearances prior to Leeds' 3-2 defeat at Manchester City last month but has now found the net in each of his past five outings, scoring twice in Saturday's 4-1 win over Crystal Palace at Elland Road.\n\nRooney feels the striker could yet force his way into Thomas Tuchel's squad for next summer's World Cup in the USA, Mexico and Canada.\n\n\"If he continues this, then there's no reason why he shouldn't be talked about – or even get an opportunity – to go to the World Cup, purely because of the lack of forwards England have got,\" Rooney said.\n\n\"He competes, he's great in the air, he's good in both boxes. When he's in a run of form and scoring goals like he is, he's a handful to play against.\n\n\"You forget, he's still quite young, he's still got a bit left in him and you forget how good a player he is.\"\n\nCalvert-Lewin scored 71 goals during his time at Everton but only found the net three times in his final season with the club, missing over three months of the campaign with a hamstring injury.\n\n\"I think Everton made the right decision [to let him go],\" Rooney continued. \"Over the past couple of seasons, he was never fit, really, and he was out of contract.\n\n\"It would have been very difficult for Everton to give him a new contract with his injury record, but he's gone to Leeds, kept himself fit. The physios are doing a good job with him there.\"\n\nDespite scoring the only goal against David Moyes' side, Arsenal striker Viktor Gyokeres has struggled for form since his summer move from Sporting.\n\nThe Sweden international's emphatic penalty was his seventh goal in all competitions this season – and first since a 2-0 victory at Burnley on 1 November.\n\nRooney, though, feels Gyokeres should not only be judged by his goalscoring record.\n\n\"He does a bit more than what you see,\" he said. \"Even [on Saturday], he occupies the two centre-backs, [James] Tarkowski and Michael Keane. That creates a bit more space for your number 10 or your wide players who are coming inside.\n\n\"I think he's important for Arsenal. He's doing a job which helps other players, he just hasn't got the goals which you'd expect from him.\n\n\"You maybe don't see it, it's not eye-catching, but he does occupy the centre-back. Can he be better? Of course he can. Should he score more goals playing in that team? Yeah, he should.\n\n\"But I think if Arsenal go on to win the league, then he'll have had a big role to play, definitely.\"\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "A couple of months ago, I received a request from a random Internet user to add CSRF protection to my little web framework Microdot, and I thought it was a fantastic idea.\n\nWhen I set off to do this work in early November I expected I was going to have to deal with anti-CSRF tokens, double-submit cookies and hidden form fields, pretty much the traditional elements that we have used to build a defense against CSRF for years. And I did start along this tedious route. But then I bumped into a new way some people are dealing with CSRF attacks that is way simpler, which I describe below.\n\nAn often shared piece of advice is that you should never implement security features yourself. Instead, you should look for well established solutions built by people who think about security day in and day out.\n\nUnfortunately, as the lead (and only) maintainer of Microdot, I do not have an ecosystem of existing solutions available to me. Even though I gladly accept external contributions, most of the framework has been built by myself out of nothing. So in this case, like many other times before, I felt I had no choice but to go against the standard advice and write CSRF protection code by myself, because if I didn't do it then the feature would not be built.\n\nWhat is the first step when you need to build a security feature? Check out what OWASP has to say about the matter.\n\nSo, in early November, I opened OWASP's CSRF Prevention Cheat Sheet page to see what was new and interesting in the world of CSRF protection. And I found that nothing of significance had changed.\n\nAccording to OWASP, the best CSRF protection you could get (at the time I checked) was still built around the idea of using anti-CSRF tokens. So I set off to implement this for Microdot.\n\nI was happily making progress on my CSRF implementation, and then in early December, another random Internet user dropped an issue on the Flask repository, proposing that Flask adds support for \"modern\" CSRF protection. Modern? How could there be a new way to protect against CSRF that isn't mentioned by OWASP?\n\nThis led me down a rabbit hole of blog posts and discussions spanning the Go and Ruby communities, plus a long discussion about this method on the OWASP GitHub repository itself, resulting in a pull request that added a mention of this method to the CSRF Cheat Sheet, only a couple of weeks after I went to this page looking for guidance for my own implementation.\n\nThe so called \"modern\" method to protect against CSRF attacks is based on the Sec-Fetch-Site header, which all modern desktop and mobile browsers include in the requests they send to servers. According to Mozilla, all browsers released since March 2023 have support for this header.\n\nThe Sec-Fetch-Site header can have one of four values:\n\nThe value of this header cannot be set via JavaScript, so the server can assume that a) if this header is present, then the client is a web browser, and b) the value of the header can be trusted. So basically, the server can reject requests that come with this header set to cross-site, and in essence that is all you need to do to protect against CSRF!\n\nAfter seeing this, I paused my work on the token-based CSRF implementation and spent a few hours to implement this modern approach. As always, the devil is in the details, so let's see what else I needed to do to build a complete solution.\n\nFirst of all, in some cases subdomains sharing the same registered domain may operate independently, and as such, it is not out of the question that one subdomain may attempt to attack another through CSRF. Depending on the level of trust an application has for other subdomains, a server may want to block requests that come with the Sec-Fetch-Site header set to same-site. In Microdot, I have added an argument allow_subdomains to cover this case. I decided to err on the side of security, so the default is False, meaning that requests from subdomains are also blocked.\n\nThe other big problem is that not everyone is using a recent browser that implements this header. Looking at the browser compatibility for the Sec-Fetch-Site header, you can see that most browsers implemented this feature long ago, between 2019 and 2021, with one notable exception: Safari. Apple added this header to its browser in 2023, so it is reasonable to assume that there are still users out there running older browsers that do not support it.\n\nOne option is to reject all requests that do not have the Sec-Fetch-Site header. This keeps everyone secure, but of course, there's going to be some unhappy users of old devices that will not be able to use your application. Plus, this would also reject HTTP clients that are not browsers. If this is not a problem for your use case, then great, but it isn't a good solution overall.\n\nFrom what I gathered from looking at other implementations of this method, an accepted solution is to use the Origin header as fallback when Sec-Fetch-Site is not implemented, since this header has been around for much longer. The last of the major browsers to add it were Firefox desktop in 2019 and Edge and Firefox mobile in 2020. Like Sec-Fetch-Site, the Origin header is also a restricted header that is set by the browser, so it can also be used to determine from where a request is coming from.\n\nThe problem with using the Origin header is that it isn't always easy to know what is the correct origin that applies to a web application. The standard option is to compare the value of the Origin header against the value of the Host header, but Host only includes the hostname and port, while Origin also includes the scheme. Also, the Host header is overwritten as it passes through reverse proxies. So comparing these two headers is actually not easy.\n\nAnother, more direct option is to ask the user to configure the expected origin name explicitly. To keep things simple, in Microdot I opted for the explicit configuration, for which I linked to the existing Cross-Origin Request Sharing (CORS) support. The CORS feature already maintains a list of allowed origins, so my CSRF logic automatically trusts these. I decided to not complicate myself adding support for Host header checks at this time, but maybe I'll add this in the future.\n\nFilippo Valsorda, a security developer active in the Go ecosystem (and author of the popular mkcert tool) wrote a blog post about this method that you may want to check out if you want to learn more details about it. He seems to be the first to propose this method and has implemented it for the Go standard library.\n\nAlso if you are interested, feel free to review my implementation of CSRF protection in Microdot. Have a look at the documentation, the code and an example, and let me know if you have any improvements or fixes to suggest.\n\nAs I mentioned above, the CSRF Prevention Cheat Sheet page from OWASP was updated in early December to include the use of the Sec-Fetch-Site header in the list of prevention methods. But this method is listed as a defense in depth mechanism, and not a complete solution.\n\nI referenced the discussion in the OWASP GitHub repository that resulted in the recent changes made to the Cheat Sheet page. Several participants in that discussion have suggested that this method should be upgraded to a complete alternative to the standard token-based approaches. The OWASP maintainer was initially skeptical, but towards the end of the thread they appear to be warming up to the idea and in search of opinions from other leading security experts. So it is quite possible that this method will become mainstream in the near future.\n\nI consider that in Microdot, going from no CSRF support at all to this is a great step forward that is also consistent with the minimalist ethos of the project. I will be keeping an eye on the OWASP CSRF Cheat Sheet page to see if they end up elevating this new protection method to the top level, and if they don't, I still have a mostly complete implementation of double-submit anti-CSRF tokens that I can bring into my project.\n\nWhat I like the most about working in open source is that all the work happens in the open, so it is a permanent record that can be searched and reviewed. My CSRF protection journey started as a somewhat tedious exercise in the use of cryptography and cookies, but then thanks to an unexpected lead it turned into a fun and exciting learning opportunity for me.",

    "description": "When I first built our AI assistant, it had five tools. Look up an order. Process a refund. Check ticket availability. Simple stuff.",
    "fullText": "When I first built our AI assistant, it had five tools. Look up an order. Process a refund. Check ticket availability. Simple stuff. Fast forward six months and we're at nearly 40 tools spanning orders, events, marketing campaigns, contests, and customer management.\n\nThe problem became obvious during a routine cost review: we were burning thousands of tokens on every single request just describing tools the model would never use. Someone asks \"What time does my show start?\" and we're sending the full spec for process_refund, create_email_campaign, and manage_contest_prizes. Wasteful.\n\nEach tool definition isn't trivial. You need a name, a description detailed enough for the LLM to understand when to use it, and parameter specifications with types and constraints. Here's what one looks like in our codebase:\n\nMultiply by 40 and you're looking at 3,000+ tokens before the user even says anything. The costs add up, latency increases, and here's the kicker: having too many tools actually makes the model worse at picking the right one. More noise, more confusion.\n\nThe fix is conceptually simple. Instead of sending every tool on every request, we embed all tool descriptions into vectors and store them in Postgres using pgvector. When a query comes in, we embed it too, then find the 5-10 most semantically similar tools using cosine distance.\n\nThe query \"refund order #12345\" gets embedded, compared against all tool embeddings, and returns process_refund, calculate_refund_amount, get_order_details. We send only those to the LLM.\n\nThis cuts our tool payload by 75-90% on most requests. The model sees fewer, more relevant options and picks better.\n\nWe debated two main approaches: calling OpenAI's embedding API or running our own model.\n\nOpenAI's text-embedding-3-small is the path of least resistance. It's a REST call, returns 1536-dimensional vectors, costs about a hundredth of a cent per embedding, and just works. The semantic understanding is excellent. The downside is the external dependency. Every query needs a network round-trip, your data touches their servers, and you're subject to their rate limits and outages.\n\nRunning something like ModernBERT locally is appealing for different reasons. Zero marginal cost, sub-millisecond latency since there's no network hop, and complete data privacy. But now you're managing infrastructure. You need a server running the model, monitoring, scaling considerations, and you're on the hook for model selection and updates. For a small team, that operational burden is real.\n\nThere's also a hybrid approach: use OpenAI in production for reliability, run a local model in development and testing to avoid API costs and flakiness. We built our system with a provider abstraction to make this possible:\n\nSwitching providers is a config change. The abstraction cost an extra hour upfront but buys flexibility later.\n\nFor our volume, OpenAI was the obvious choice. We process hundreds of queries daily, not millions. At $0.00001 per embedding, we're talking pennies per month. The reliability is excellent, the semantic quality is strong for our e-commerce domain, and there's zero infrastructure to manage.\n\nIf we were processing millions of queries or had strict data residency requirements, the calculus would be different. But for a small team running a ticketing platform, paying a few cents to avoid running another service is a good trade.\n\nAdding a new tool or updating an existing one means regenerating embeddings. In development, it's a mix task:\n\nThis iterates through all tool definitions, calls OpenAI for each, and upserts the results into the tool_embeddings table. Takes about 10 seconds for 40 tools. The task is idempotent so you can run it whenever.\n\nThe implementation is straightforward. We convert each ToolDefinition to embedding text that captures the name, description, and parameter info, then store the vector alongside the tool name and model ID.\n\nFor production, we built a simple admin page. Navigate to the AI operations screen, see the current embedding count, click a button to regenerate. Non-technical team members can trigger it after tool updates without touching the console.\n\nThe alternative is shelling into the production console:\n\nEither way, regeneration is safe to run anytime. It deletes existing embeddings and creates fresh ones. The whole process takes seconds.\n\nOne gotcha: if you ever switch embedding providers, you must regenerate everything. OpenAI's 1536-dimension vectors are incompatible with a local model's 768-dimension vectors. We store model_id with each embedding to catch mismatches and make debugging easier.\n\nPure similarity search has a gap. If someone says \"refund order #12345\", we'll find process_refund. But the LLM also needs get_order_details to look up the order before it can refund anything. Those two tools aren't semantically similar enough to both appear in the top results.\n\nWe solved this with category expansion. Each tool has a category like :orders, :refunds, or :events. When we select tools via similarity, we expand to include related categories:\n\nSo finding process_refund (category :refunds) automatically pulls in order lookup tools. The LLM gets everything it needs for multi-step workflows.\n\nFor those curious about the database side, here's the actual query we run:\n\nThe <=> operator is pgvector's cosine distance. We filter by a similarity threshold (0.4 by default) to avoid returning completely irrelevant tools, then take the top K results. The whole thing runs in under 10ms.\n\nWe use Mimic for mocking in tests. Every test that touches tool selection stubs the embedding provider to return consistent vectors:\n\nThis keeps tests fast, deterministic, and free of API dependencies. We can simulate failures too, testing that the system gracefully falls back to using all tools when embedding generation fails.\n\nA few things surprised us along the way.\n\nThe similarity threshold matters more than we expected. Too high and you filter out useful tools. Too low and you're back to noise. We settled on 0.4 after some experimentation but it's worth tuning for your domain.\n\nCategory expansion was an afterthought that became essential. Pure semantic similarity misses the dependencies between tools. If your assistant does multi-step operations, you need something like this.\n\nThe provider abstraction was worth it even though we haven't switched providers. It forced us to think cleanly about the interface and made testing much easier. The Mimic stubs work because there's a clear boundary to mock.\n\nCold start is a real concern. If your embeddings table is empty, you need a fallback. We log a warning and use all tools, which isn't ideal but prevents complete failure.\n\nAfter rolling this out, our per-request token usage for tool definitions dropped 60-80%. Latency improved by about 200ms since the model processes fewer tokens. Tool selection accuracy actually got slightly better because there's less noise confusing the model.\n\nThe embedding costs are negligible. We're at maybe $0.01 per day for our volume. The whole system adds a 10ms database query per request, which disappears in the noise of the LLM call.\n\nFor anyone dealing with tool explosion in their AI agents, this approach is worth considering. The implementation isn't complex, the costs are minimal, and the benefits compound as your tool count grows.",

Clair Obscur has many strengths in its combat and world design, but it's the story that will stick with you long after completion, making it a great entry to kick off this list.\n\nFanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fandom.\n\nMuch is made of its brutal combat, but Elden Ring's worldbuilding is also the stuff of legend. It's got it all – sinister locations rich with history, rounded characters tied by the strands of fate, and a vast open-world where the story unravels at the player's own pace. With Nightreign – an experimental, multiplayer non-sequel – fans can glean more information about the mysterious world of Elden Ring through new events and stories.\n\nIn our review of Elden Ring Nightreign, we were surprised by the quality of the stories despite the multiplayer-centric structure. If you're craving more forays into this grim fantasy landscape, you won't want to let this one pass you by. You don't have to go in unprepared, either. We've already put together a list of the best Elden Ring Nightreign mods, as well as a range of Elden Ring Nightreign guides on anything from picking a class to how to beat the Darkdrift Knight Boss.\n\nWanderstop is a calming, yet challenging, tea shop management simulator with a twist from the creator of The Stanley Parable. The game begins with a mystery: a fierce, unstoppable fighter suddenly finds themselves unable to wield their sword properly. Again and again they're beaten in battle, until it becomes clear they're experiencing some kind of burnout. Their method of pushing through the pain begins to fail, and they're made to slow down with a job at a tea shop. They hate every minute of it.\n\nIn our review of Wanderstop, we praised the game's writing as brutally honest about the impact of burnout and the sacrifices recovery sometimes asks of us. The management side is good fun, allowing you to brew teas with just about any ingredients you can find, but the tender story is the star of the show. If you find your perfectionist brain starting to creep in, we've put together this Wanderstop Recipes Guide, featuring all the tea recipes and how to make them. We love a happy customer.\n\nLost Records: Bloom and Rage is a two-part adventure from the team behind Life is Strange. Set across the dual timelines of 1995 and 2022, the player inhabits the shoes of Swann, a young girl starting a punk band with her best friends. Using a camcorder to record your experience, and making fast-thinking choices to decide how events play out, you'll uncover the mystery behind a dark event that no one has dared speak about until now.\n\nLost Records is a deeply immersive game that never shies away from being raw, messy, and honest. We noted in our review of Lost Records: Bloom and Rage that it perfectly captures the magic and melodrama of our teenage years, and the way these events get muddied over time.\n\n1000XResist is a groundbreaking, heartrending, sci-fi epic told across the span of a thousand years of whispers and lies. Taking on the coveted role of Watcher in an underground all-female society, you're shown snippets of what came before – the disease that wiped out the rest of humanity, the giant humanoid aliens that drove you beneath the surface, and memories of the young woman of whose DNA you are a clone.\n\n1000xResist doesn't have combat, but you'll find plenty of tense moments between cinematic turns and exploratory segments. As a recent winner of the Peabody Award for Interactive & Immersive Work and a nominee for the Nebula Award for Best Game Writing, it's an unforgettable journey nestled inside a largely narrative-led game, offering multiple endings depending on your moral choices.\n\nSet in the eponymous Louisiana town of Norco, this surreal Southern Gothic tale is perfectly pitched between cinematic narrative and immersive mystery. In our Norco review, we praised its \"beautiful, evocative, and contemplative storytelling\", presenting a rich dystopian world that pits corporate greed against the horrifying resilience of nature.\n\nStrange, terrible, and often funny encounters with an eclectic cast seem to link the lead character's mother's disappearance with the local oil refinery and a mysteriously omnipresent odd-jobs app. Tinged with grief and fear, the story knows when to ramp up the tension, and when to deliver an emotional blow. It's a beautifully crafted piece of storytelling and one of the best point-and-click games around.\n\n2024's Still Wakes the Deep is a masterfully told psychological horror set on a collapsing oil rig in the North Sea. The problems of an already fragile crew are elevated to the stuff of nightmares as a dredged up eldritch horror begins to tear their minds (and the precarious rig) apart. None of the crew have any superhuman skills, lead character Caz isn't particularly strong or brave himself, you'll not find any overpowered weapons here and – as we noted in our Still Wakes the Deep review – the odds feel like they're perpetually collapsing around you. All you can really do is hide and pray.\n\nIt's a claustrophobic fight to survive, squeezing through vents and pounding your way down flooding corridors, yet still the tender stories of those around you still break through in moments of melancholic relief. What makes Still Wakes the Deep stand out is its emphasis on the fact that you're not alone. Having no one to rely on is scary, but perhaps having people rely on you is worse.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Great Circle not only has a great story, but tells it by giving you the starring role in a movie. Through stealth sections, puzzles, platforming, and scrappy combat, this action adventure – featuring everyone's favourite behatted ophidiophobe – has a bit of everything. Set between the events of Raiders of the Lost Ark and those of The Last Crusade, The Great Circle tells a brand new story framed by familiar faces.\n\nThere's plenty of freedom to explore, outsmart enemies, and solve environmental riddles in a number of huge open-ended levels, making this a story you can tell in your own way. In our Indiana Jones and the Great Circle review, we were especially impressed by how the game captures the look, sound, and spirit of the movies, presenting a riveting story with an unexpected focus on stealth and freeform exploration.\n\nHarold Halibut's entire premise is the strength of the story and characters within. Playing it is akin to sitting down with a box-set series and watching it all in one go on a rainy Saturday afternoon. It's mostly a walking simulator, taking you through a beautiful story set on a crashed spaceship far out in the cosmos, where everyone is just trying to figure out a way back home.\n\nHarold Halibut invites us to connect with people and their perspectives with an open heart. Each character is richly realised, with hopes and dreams and fears all of their own, while – as we pointed out in our Harold Halibut review – the hand-made aesthetics of the game make each location feel alive and lived-in. As Buddy the in-game mailman would have it, \"each person aboard this ship is a world of their own.\"\n\nOld Skies is one of the best games to come out in 2025, a tale of love and loss with plenty of mystery holding it together. Wadjet Eye Games continue their long run of exceptionally good point-and-click adventures, with the gorgeous art, complex puzzles, and immersive voice acting we've come to expect.\n\nAs a professional time traveler, Fia Quinn is tasked with zipping between various eras of New York City at the whim of her wealthy clients, toeing the thin line between tiny historical tweaks and upsetting the balance of the entire future. In our review of Old Skies, we especially liked how the story surprises with its exploration into the negatives of not influencing the flow of time, of being someone that no one remembers, regardless of what you accomplish.\n\nIt might sound like a rogue choice to suggest a game that isn't quite finished, but the completed Chapters 1-4 of Deltarune are already enough to get excited about. Deltarune is funny, irreverent, and occasionally tragic, as well as being beautifully accommodating to both Undertale fans who can't get enough of Toby Fox's twisting, subversive narratives, and new players who want to see what all the fuss is about.\n\nDeltarune's Chapter 2 made GameSpot's Best of 2021 despite being half the size it is now, and we know the wait for Deltarune's next chapter won't be very long in comparison. The release of four chapters in one go has given fans plenty to dig into, whether it's the main story's themes of friendship and mercy, or the countless hidden easter eggs and secrets peppered throughout the varied worlds of each chapter.\n\nOne of the games recently brought to PlayStation as part of a wider Xbox strategy, Pentiment is a visually stunning point-and-click adventure with a twist. The character of Andreas Maler not only solves puzzles and problems as a tumultuous time of political unrest threatens a 16th century Alpine town, but also makes decisions that will come to affect the lives of those around him in unexpected ways.\n\nFilled with gorgeous artwork based on illustrated manuscripts and ancient religious works, the game uses fonts as an unconventional way to signify class and accents between characters. Minor details show such care and attention, and the overarching plot is both fascinating and emotionally wrought. The story of Pentiment is one you won't forget.\n\nThe Excavation of Hob's Barrow is a point-and-click adventure absolutely drenched in creepy folklore and dark magic. Arriving in the quaint English town of Bewlay to conduct some excavations, Thomasina Bateman soon finds herself thrown into a horrifying conspiracy that goes back centuries, tying her family and the townsfolk to an unimaginable evil.\n\nAlongside the story's folk horror themes are meditations on loss, family, and the fragility of memory. Lost in Cult have recently kicked off their new line of physical games with The Excavation of Hob's Barrow, featuring original artwork and an essay booklet, a testament to the game's poignant story and its impact on those who have played it.\n\nMetaphor: ReFantazio took the gaming world by storm when it first came out, but it's not too late to get stuck in. One of very few games in the history of Gamespot to earn a 10/10 review, and undoubtedly one of the best PC games to play in 2025, if you're looking for a game that ticks every box – gameplay, story, combat, art – you'll want to jump on this one.\n\nMetaphor: ReFantazio follows a young boy whose initial mission to deliver a letter evolves into a sprawling journey packed with giant monstrosities to battle and a world at war with itself. The game reaches deep into topics of politics, religion, and community, inviting the player to have frank conversations about the impact of each of these things on our wider world. Metaphor: ReFantazio really is a modern masterpiece.\n\nDespite its indie status, Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector is one of the biggest game releases of January 2025. Building on the success of 2022's Citizen Sleeper, the sequel is packed with character-rich storylines, beautifully-written dialogue, and moral challenges. The story starts in much the same way as the original, you awake as a sleeper (a sentient android housing a human mind) and have to find a way to stop your robot body malfunctioning and hide from the mercenaries coming after you.\n\nIt's a wonderfully-realised story that allows us to learn from our missteps as much as our triumphs, emphasising that the choices we make matter – especially when the odds are stacked against us.\n\nThe Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy is the brain child of directors Kazutaka Kodaka and Kotaro Uchikoshi, best known for the Danganronpa and Zero Escape series, respectively. Their team-up has resulted in a game that bears some resemblance to both those series, but blown up massively. The branching story of The Hundred Line - which follows a group of teenagers who find themselves locked into the titular academy for 100 days, told that it's their job to protect it from an invading alien force that's trying to wipe out humanity - features over 100 distinct endings. Unlocking all of them will take well over 100 hours. \n\nBut this is a list of the games with the best stories, not the most stories, and thankfully The Hundred Line's enormous script is thoroughly entertaining. Getting to know all the different characters across multiple scenarios and temporalities is a real treat, and many of the revelations you'll uncover while unlocking and exploring different story paths are hugely surprising. The turn-based strategy battles peppered throughout The Hundred Line are good fun too, but it's the twisty, strange storytelling that will keep you hooked.\n\nSilent Hill f is simultaneously both a departure from the usual Silent Hill formula, and yet deeply familiar. The game trades the series' usual American settings for 1960s Japan, where teenage girl Shimizu Hinako finds herself beset by a coterie of monsters shambling out of the series' familiar fog. Despite a new close-combat system and a very different environment, Silent Hill f carries the same eeriness and creeping tension as its predecessors.\n\nSilent Hill f is written by Ryukishi07, a Japanese writer best known for the When They Cry visual novel series. The story digs deep into some dark themes, including familial abuse and sexism; as you might expect from the Silent Hill series, there's a lot going on under the surface. There are five endings, and to get the whole story you'll have to finish the game multiple times, but persistence is rewarded with some of the best, smartest storytelling in any game released in 2025.\n\nManagement sims aren't known for their storylines, but Promise Mascot Agency has one of the best stories you could hope for if your jam is irreverent, chaotic, surreal Japanese mysteries. The game – from the makers of Paradise Killer – made our list of the best Steam Deck games to play in 2025, and for good reason.\n\nTaking on the role of an exiled Yakuza sent to a cursed town to make back the money he lost, you'll have to recruit sentient mascots to prop up your new business front. In amongst the everyday business management, there are individual stories of self-fulfillment to explore, the overarching murder mystery at the heart of your exile, and a range of activities to bring a once-prosperous town back into the limelight.\n\nDIspatch is the return of the episodic, choice-based narrative adventure games that developer Telltale Games popularized in the early 2010s. The whole series is available now, but players who jumped on the game at launch were able to experience a weekly drop of episodes, each one following the journey of former superhero Robert Robertson III in his new role as a superhero dispatcher.\n\nDispatch deepens its world and characters across its eight episodes, mixing the worlds of superpowered beings and office politics well. As you choose how Robert will respond to different situations, the story changes and adapts based on who you get close to, when you speak honestly, and how effectively you run your team. The sharp humor, clever twists on superhero storytelling, and fantastic animation make Dispatch feel like an excellent playable television show. The game has been successful enough that a second season is likely, and it's coming to Switch and Switch 2 soon, as well.\n\nDeveloper: Supergiant Games\nRelease Date: September 25, 2025\nPlatforms: PC, Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch\nGenre: Action roguelike \n\nSupergiant Games' second go around with the Greek pantheon yielded a rare GameSpot 10/10, and a large part of that is the game's incredible storytelling. In Hades 2 you play as Melinoe, sister of Hades protagonist Zagreus, who must face off against the titan Chronos after the time master seizes the throne from her father. The central tale of Melinoe's struggle is compelling, but what really elevates this game's storytelling is all the incidental conversations you'll encounter.\n\nThe gods bicker, fuss, and gossip with you, as do all the other characters you'll encounter, whose backstories slowly spill out over many meetings. The writing is witty and sharp, and the voice acting, across the board, is excellent, imbuing each character with depth (if not always a lot of nuance). It will take a long, long playtime with Hades 2 to run out of new unique interactions.",

    "description": "Rare recordings of E.E. Cummings, Mary Oliver and more offer a tour through literary history led by authors in their own words — and voices. Take a listen.",
    "fullText": "Tom Wolfe was a fast talker. Eudora Welty had a musical Southern drawl. Kurt Vonnegut’s jokes got belly laughs.\n\nEach of these authors once spoke to audiences at the 92nd Street Y Unterberg Poetry Center in New York City, which has hosted some of the most celebrated writers of the past several generations, from Isaac Asimov to Anaïs Nin and Kazuo Ishiguro to Margaret Atwood. Now, the Poetry Center has digitized audio recordings of its literary events stretching back to 1949 — hundreds of which have never been released before — in a collection that offers a glimpse into history and a taste of what the writers themselves were like in public.\n\nIn 1965, for example, the year before he became consultant in poetry to the Library of Congress, James Dickey complained that his 14-year-old son had acquired a taste for rock ’n’ roll and a transistor radio. The sound of electric guitars had taken over his house. He was joined onstage that night by the poet Theodore Weiss, but it could have been Truman Capote, Joseph Heller or Adrienne Rich, who also visited the Poetry Center over the years.\n\n“Historically, it’s been the premier place to read your work in public in the United States,” said Billy Collins, a former U.S. poet laureate, who has read at the Poetry Center many times. “Maybe short of the White House or Carnegie Hall — but most poets don’t get to Carnegie Hall no matter how hard they practice.”\n\nYou can listen to some clips from the archive below.\n\nBaldwin was a gifted public speaker, compelling and quick on his feet. The eldest son of a preacher, Baldwin turned his own oratorical skills to advocacy and debate after a short stint at the pulpit as a teenager. Here, he talks about the mysteries of the writing process.\n\nIn this recording, Didion reads from her book “The Year of Magical Thinking,” which recounts her daughter’s grave illness and the sudden death of her husband, John Gregory Dunne. Didion and Dunne had been married for 40 years when, after visiting their daughter at the hospital, Dunne collapsed at the dinner table from a heart attack. He was pronounced dead a few hours later. The book offers a portrait of both loss and the long marriage that preceded it.\n\nThe prolific and prizewinning poet reads “Wild Geese,” one of her most celebrated poems. Oliver, who died in 2019, read at the Poetry Center three times during her life. On each of those visits, she made sure to include this fan favorite.\n\nVonnegut was best known for his novels, including “Slaughterhouse-Five” and “Cat’s Cradle,” but because he was at the Poetry Center, he thought he should read some poems. How he met the moment was quintessential Vonnegut: genial and cheeky in equal measure.\n\nWolfe, an author and journalist, was known both for novels including “The Bonfire of the Vanities” and for the role he played in helping to create “New Journalism,” which employed novelistic techniques in nonfiction. Wolfe was also an exceptionally snappy dresser, and he was often photographed wearing a bespoke three-piece white suit — although he chose a different outfit for the reporting trip he recounts here.\n\nThe earliest recording in the collection is of the American poet E.E. Cummings, who read at the Poetry Center in 1949. Cummings was born in 1894 and died in 1962, so even readers who love his distinctive style — with its unusual, almost sculptural line breaks and formatting — may not be familiar with his stately reading voice.\n\nThis selection is pulled from a Q. and A. with the playwright behind such classics of American theater as “The Crucible” and “Death of a Salesman.” A member of the audience asked about Miller’s play “The American Clock,” which is set during the Great Depression and was first staged in 1980: was Miller, the audience member asked, expecting another economic calamity when he wrote it?\n\n“dying is fine,” from “The Complete Poems: 1904-1962,” by E.E.

    "description": "Outside the gym, Martha Stewart says she tries to stay active by walking, gardening, and working.",
    "fullText": "Fitness trends come and go, but at 84, Martha Stewart remains loyal to the workout routine she has followed for years.\n\n\"I've worked out ever since I can remember,\" Stewart told Women's Health in an interview published on Friday. Even outside the gym, she makes it a point to stay active.\n\n\"I walk a whole lot. I garden a whole lot. I go to work in New York [City] pretty much five days a week or do my traveling,\" she said.\n\nStewart said her go-to exercises haven't changed much.\n\n\"I might not be as energetic as I used to be, but I'm pretty good,\" she said. \"The amount of weights and things that I use are pretty much the same as they've always been, so I'm strong. I'm very strong.\"\n\nAt 6:30 a.m. on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Stewart heads into a mat and reformer Pilates session with her instructor. \"I do a very intense program, and it's nonstop for 45 minutes,\" she said.\n\nSince she regularly commutes into the city by car, Stewart says Pilates helps her stay loose and flexible. \"It also is very good for strengthening one's bones, keeping one limber, working with aches and pains, stretching out,\" she said.\n\nShe practices yoga too, though less frequently than Pilates.\n\n\"Pilates reminds me a little bit of yoga,\" she said. \"I end with yoga stretches on blocks at Pilates.\"\n\nHer Tuesday and Thursday mornings are reserved for 45 minutes of strength training with her trainer, using mostly dumbbells and machines.\n\nDespite her busy schedule, Stewart remains committed to her fitness. \"Even when I get home late at night, I still go and do my workout,\" she added.\n\nA key part of her wellness routine also involves drinking green juice every morning, made with fresh vegetables from her garden. \"That's a priority,\" she said.\n\nTo make the green juice, Stewart typically mixes spinach, cucumbers, parsley, celery, and mint, and sometimes adds ginger or half an orange, including the peel.\n\n\"I grow that [produce] year-round,\" she said. \"It's very important that they be grown in my own organic soil, and it makes delicious juice.\"\n\nIn 2023, Stewart told Business Insider that Pilates and green juice helped her prepare for her iconic Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue cover.\n\n\"If you have my green juice every day, you would just feel great all the time,\" she said.\n\nStewart is one of several Hollywood stars who believe wellness comes down to sticking with what works.\n\nSpeaking to People in January, Jane Fonda said her workout routine hasn't changed much over the years either.\n\n\"I essentially do everything I used to do, just slower,\" Fonda, now 88, said. \"I used to be a runner, but now I love walking. I love being outdoors in the woods, especially up and down hills.\"\n\nIn April, Helen Mirren told The Times that she still considers a 12-minute military workout developed by the Royal Canadian Air Force in the 1950s to be her go-to exercise.\n\nShe also encouraged those in their 50s and 60s to incorporate low-impact physical activities into their lives.\n\n\"It doesn't have to be joining a gym. It can be small changes like taking a short walk or practicing yoga, which I still enjoy,\" she said.",

    "description": "The US is now reviewing the social media of some visa applicants. Several major tech companies are warning visa holders not to leave the country.",
    "fullText": "The world's largest technology companies are scrambling to manage a growing crisis affecting thousands of their employees on work visas, as new social media screening requirements trigger delays at US embassies and consulates worldwide.\n\nGoogle, Apple, Microsoft, and ServiceNow have all sent advisories to visa-holding employees in recent days, warning them against international travel and describing appointment delays stretching up to a year.\n\nThe memos, sent by immigration law firms representing these companies or by their internal legal teams, paint a picture of mounting uncertainty for foreign workers who form a critical part of the tech industry's workforce.\n\nThe warnings come as American embassies have postponed routine visa stamping appointments, leaving some employees already abroad unable to return to work in the US for extended periods.\n\nFor H-1B holders, the primary work visa used by tech companies, the situation creates a particularly difficult bind. If their visa stamp expires and they travel abroad, they must obtain a new stamp at a consulate before re-entering the US. With appointments now being rescheduled months into the future, what would typically be a routine trip home has become a potential career disruption lasting up to a year.\n\nOn Friday, a spokesperson for the Department of State told Business Insider it was now conducting \"online presence reviews for applicants.\" The department said it may move appointments as resources change, with applicants able to request expedited slots on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\"While in the past the emphasis may have been on processing cases quickly and reducing wait times, our embassies and consulates around the world, including in India, are now prioritizing thoroughly vetting each visa case above all else,\" the State Department spokesperson said. Appointments in Ireland and Vietnam have also been postponed, according to immigration firm Reddy Neumann Brown PC.\n\nBelow are the full texts of the internal memos sent to employees at these companies, obtained by Business Insider, which reveal how corporate America is responding to the visa processing slowdown.\n\nGoogle and Microsoft declined to comment, while Apple and ServiceNow did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nBelow is the text of a memo sent by Jack Chen, Microsoft's associate general counsel for immigration.\n\nBelow is the text of an email sent by Berry Appleman & Leiden LLP (BAL), the immigration firm that represents Google.\n\nBelow is the text of an email sent by Apple's immigration team.\n\nBelow is the text of an email sent by ServiceNow's Global Mobility Team.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "At a revised 984 feet, the new Turkish ship would approach the length range of the American Nimitz and Ford-class carriers.",
    "fullText": "Turkey announced on Saturday that the length of its coming first-ever aircraft carrier is now meant to be 300 meters, or roughly 984 feet, making the vessel one of the longest operated by NATO allies.\n\nThe country's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, highlighted the carrier's revised size as he spoke at an Istanbul shipyard about Turkey's naval construction industry.\n\nErdogan said work had already started on the new carrier, which he called an \"older brother\" to the TCG Anadolu, an amphibious assault ship operated by the Turkish navy that is 261 feet long.\n\nThe length of a warship doesn't necessarily translate into actual size, which is more accurately measured in tons of water displaced.\n\nHowever, a carrier's length can significantly influence the space available on its flight deck, with profound impacts on capabilities such as the number of aircraft that can be accommodated, runway length, and the type of catapult launch system or ramp used.\n\nWhen Turkey began unveiling details in late 2024 for its carrier — for now dubbed the MUGEM-class — the vessel was designed to displace 60,000 tons of water, with a length of 935 feet.\n\nOriginally announced plans said the carrier would accommodate up to 50 aircraft, including 20 stationed on the flight deck, with a crew of 800.\n\nIt's now approaching the length range of American carriers, which are the largest in the world. The USS Gerald R. Ford is 1,107 feet long and has a displacement of 100,000 tons at full load, while the older Nimitz-class carriers are roughly 1,092 feet long with a displacement of around 100,000 tons, too.\n\nThe Turkish ship's new length is also being pushed far past that of the UK's Queen Elizabeth-class ships, which are 932 feet long and displace roughly 80,000 tons, and France's Charles De Gaulle, a much older vessel that's 857 feet long and displaces about 42,500 tons.\n\nAlthough part of NATO, Turkey has long sought to achieve defense autonomy through its own military technology.\n\nThe new carrier was originally meant to feature a ski-jump ramp for aircraft takeoff, but is now expected to use a locally made catapult system. Turkey is unlikely to deploy vertical-takeoff F-35Bs on the ship, since it was removed from the fighter program by the US after purchasing Russian S-400s in 2019.\n\nAt the Saturday event, Erdogan also announced the commissioning of the TCG Hızırreis, the second of Turkey's Reis-class submarines, and highlighted a new uncrewed surface vessel called the ULAQ.\n\nTurkey maintains NATO's second-largest standing military, behind only the US in the number of active personnel.",

    "description": "An AI security researcher says companies lack the talent to handle AI security problems — and traditional cybersecurity teams aren't enough.",
    "fullText": "Companies may have cybersecurity teams in place, but many still aren't prepared for how AI systems actually fail, says an AI security researcher.\n\nSander Schulhoff, who wrote one of the earliest prompt engineering guides and focuses on AI system vulnerabilities, said on an episode of \"Lenny's Podcast\" published Sunday that many organizations lack the talent needed to understand and fix AI security risks.\n\nTraditional cybersecurity teams are trained to patch bugs and address known vulnerabilities, but AI doesn't behave that way.\n\n\"You can patch a bug, but you can't patch a brain,\" Schulhoff said, describing what he sees as a mismatch between how security teams think and how large language models fail.\n\n\"There's this disconnect about how AI works compared to classical cybersecurity,\" he added.\n\nThat gap shows up in real-world deployments. Cybersecurity professionals may review an AI system for technical flaws without asking: \"What if someone tricks the AI into doing something it shouldn't?\" said Schulhoff, who runs a prompt engineering platform and an AI red-teaming hackathon.\n\nUnlike traditional software, AI systems can be manipulated through language and indirect instructions, he added.\n\nSchulhoff said people with experience in both AI security and cybersecurity would know what to do if an AI model is tricked into generating malicious code. For example, they would run the code in a container and ensure the AI's output doesn't affect the rest of the system.\n\nThe intersection of AI security and traditional cybersecurity is where \"the security jobs of the future are,\" he added.\n\nSchulhoff also said that many AI security startups are pitching guardrails that don't offer real protection. Because AI systems can be manipulated in countless ways, claims that these tools can \"catch everything\" are misleading.\n\n\"That's a complete lie,\" he said, adding that there would be a market correction in which \"the revenue just completely dries up for these guardrails and automated red-teaming companies.\"\n\nAI security startups have been riding the wave of investor interest. Big Tech and venture capital firms have poured money into the space as companies rush to secure AI systems.\n\nIn March, Google bought cybersecurity startup Wiz for $32 billion, a deal aimed at strengthening its cloud security business.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai said AI was introducing \"new risks\" at a time when multi-cloud and hybrid setups are becoming more common.\n\n\"Against this backdrop, organizations are looking for cybersecurity solutions that improve cloud security and span multiple clouds,\" he added.\n\nBusiness Insider reported last year that growing security concerns around AI models have helped fuel a wave of startups pitching tools to monitor, test, and secure AI systems.",

    "fullText": "GREENBELT, Md. (AP) — A federal judge on Monday will hear arguments about whether Kilmar Abrego Garcia should be returned to immigration custody after being free for just over a week.\n\nAbrego Garcia, whose mistaken deportation to El Salvador has become a lightning rod for both sides of the immigration debate, had been in immigration detention since August. In that time, the government has said it planned to deport him to Uganda, Eswatini, Ghana and, most recently, Liberia. However, officials have made no effort to deport him to the one country he has agreed to go to — Costa Rica. U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, in Maryland, has even accused the government of misleading her by falsely claiming that Costa Rica was unwilling to take him.\n\nThe government's “persistent refusal to acknowledge Costa Rica as a viable removal option, their threats to send Abrego Garcia to African countries that never agreed to take him, and their misrepresentation to the Court that Liberia is now the only country available to Abrego Garcia, all reflect that whatever purpose was behind his detention, it was not for the ‘basic purpose’ of timely third-country removal,” she wrote.\n\nXinis’ Dec. 11 order that Abrego Garcia be released from immigration custody also concluded that the immigration judge who heard his case in 2019 had failed to issue an order of removal from the U.S., and he cannot be deported anywhere without a removal order.\n\nAbrego Garcia has an American wife and child and has lived in Maryland for years, but he immigrated to the U.S. illegally from El Salvador as a teenager. In 2019, an immigration judge granted him protection from being deported back to his home country, finding he faced danger there from a gang that had targeted his family. In March, he was mistakenly deported there anyway. U.S. officials resisted calls to bring him back until the Supreme Court weighed in. However, officials have said he cannot stay in the U.S. and have vowed to deport him to a third country.\n\nIn filings last week, government attorneys argued that, with or without a final order of removal, they are still working to deport Abrego Garcia, so they can legally detain him during the process.\n\n“If there is no final order of removal, immigration proceedings are ongoing, and Petitioner is subject to pre-final order detention,” they wrote.\n\nMeanwhile, Abrego Garcia's attorneys cited a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that “because immigration proceedings ‘are civil, not criminal’ detention must be ‘nonpunitive.’” They argued that in Abrego Garcia's case, detention is punitive because the government wants to be allowed to hold him indefinitely without a viable plan to deport him.\n\n“If immigration detention does not serve the legitimate purpose of effectuating reasonably foreseeable removal, it is punitive, potentially indefinite, and unconstitutional,” they wrote.",

The boat they'd been using for their trip had been scheduled to return at about sunset.\n\nThe pair went out in a 42-foot Freeman boat named \"Unstopp-A-Bull,\" according to Luis Garcia, the supervisor on watch for the Coast Guard sector in St. Petersburg. The Coast Guard found the boat floating upright in the Gulf about 70 miles off the coast of Naples, with no signs of the missing boaters.\n\nNow, one of the largest searches in Southwest Florida history is underway, with a large community effort behind it.\n\nHere's what we know so far, as of noon, Sunday, Dec. 21.\n\nAs of 10 a.m. Sunday, Dec. 21, Randall Spivey and Brandon Billmaier, the Florida boaters reported missing Dec. 19 after a fishing trip off the coast of Naples, had not been found, according to Billmaier's wife, Deborah.\n\n\"Updates after speaking with the U.S. Coast Guard this morning,\" Deborah Billmaier wrote in a Facebook post Sunday. \"The EPIRB (Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon) was unfortunately still on the boat. They were bottom fishing when the incident occurred (still not sure exactly what occurred.)\"\n\nThe post also mentioned that a couple of life jackets were not found on the boat, indicating that Spivey and Billmaier may be wearing them.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard Sector St. Petersburg posted news of the search on social media Saturday morning, Dec. 20.\n\nAccording to the Facebook post, air and surface crews from the agency and partner agencies U.S. Coast Guard Station Fort Myers Beach, U.S. Coast Guard Air Station Clearwater, U.S. Coast Guard Air Station Miami and Lee County Sheriff's Office are involved in the search.\n\n\"The search effort support features an 87-foot boat on water, 45-foot boat, 60-foot helicopter, 144 plane, 6130 Air Force from Patrick Air Force Base and an 144 continuing through the day (not sure if this is a boat or a plane),\" Deborah Billmaier wrote in her post the following morning.\n\nAn urgent marine broadcast has also been issued to all vessels in the area to help expand the search range, said Billmaier.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard coordinated one of the largest search parties in Southwest Florida history Sunday morning, Dec. 21, starting at first light, according to Deborah Billmaier, wife of Brandon, Billmaier. In her Facebook post, she asked those with capable vessels to help out.\n\nFlorida Rep. Peggy Gossett-Seidman shared the post on X.\n\nErin Shaw Harrel of Facebook group SWFL Boaters urged people Saturday to take to the water to search for the missing boaters, providing these coordinates for the search: 25-51.67N 083-12.16W.\n\nBrent Stokes, owner of Stokes Marine, also asked for volunteers to help search.\n\nAccording to Stokes, anyone willing to help with the search could call Tricia Spivey at 239-896-4099 or the U.S. Coast Guard at 727-322-4180.\n\nAttorney Randall Spivey, 57, and his 33-year-old nephew Brandon Billmaier were reported missing at about 9 p.m. Friday, Dec. 19.\n\nTricia Spivey reported her husband and nephew missing Friday night, said Luis Garcia, supervisor on watch for the Coast Guard sector in St. Petersburg. “They were going to fish about 102 miles offshore.”\n\nSpivey is a white male, 6’1”, 245lbs, with brown hair and brown eyes. He was last seen wearing khaki pants and a dark in color shirt, according to Lee County Sheriff's Office. Billmaier is a white male, 6’2”, 250lbs, with strawberry hair and brown eyes.\n\nThe pair went out in a 42-foot Freeman boat named \"Unstopp-A-Bull,\" Garcia said. The Coast Guard later found the boat floating upright in the Gulf about 70 miles off the coast of Naples, but no signs of the missing boaters.\n\nTricia Spivey says GPS coordinates from the boat's spot tracker led them to that location near Marco Island and Flamingo. That's where the search has been concentrated.\n\nThe Lee County Sheriff's Office requested the public's help in locating Spivey and Billmaier.\n\nIf anyone knows about the pair's whereabouts, they can call 911, if applicable, or call the sheriff's office at 477-1000.

    "description": "ChatGPT recommended one retirement strategy for 2026: Maximize Roth accounts before tax rates rise. Here's why this simple move could save thousands.",
    "fullText": "When it comes to retirement planning, everyone’s got an opinion. Financial advisors push complicated portfolios, bloggers swear by extreme savings and your neighbor won’t stop talking about their real estate investments.\n\nBe Aware: Major 401(k) Change Coming in 2026 — High Earners Must Act Now\n\nRead Next: 5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up To $1K Per Month From Home\n\nSo I decided to cut through the noise and ask ChatGPT directly: What’s the single smartest retirement move to make in 2026?\n\nThe answer was surprisingly straightforward — and it has everything to do with timing.\n\nChatGPT’s response was clear: Maximize your tax-advantaged accounts with a Roth-first strategy while tax rates are still relatively low.\n\nThat means prioritizing Roth IRA contributions, Roth 401(k) contributions and Roth conversions over traditional pretax retirement accounts. The reason this matters so much right now comes down to one major deadline.\n\nLearn More: This ‘Boring’ Investment Could Be the Secret To Never Running Out of Retirement Income\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisions expire after 2025. That means many Americans will face higher federal tax rates starting in 2026 and beyond.\n\nIf you convert money from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA before rates go up, you pay taxes at today’s lower rates. Then that money grows tax-free forever and you never pay taxes on it again — even when rates are higher.\n\nChatGPT explained that this creates a perfect opportunity. Lock in lower tax rates now by moving money into Roth accounts before the window closes. For people who expect to be in a similar or higher tax bracket in retirement, this move could save thousands of dollars over a lifetime.\n\nThe Roth-first strategy isn’t complicated, but it requires action in three areas.\n\nFirst, contribute to a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) instead of the traditional versions. If your income is too high for direct Roth IRA contributions, you can use the backdoor Roth strategy by contributing to a traditional IRA and immediately converting it.\n\nSecond, consider converting some of your existing traditional IRA money to a Roth. You’ll pay taxes on the conversion amount this year, but then that money grows tax-free. The key is converting when your income is lower or tax rates are favorable — which is exactly what 2025 and early 2026 represent before rates potentially rise.\n\nThird, if you have a 401(k) with Roth options, funnel as much as possible into the Roth side. For 2025, the 401(k) contribution limit is $23,000 for people under 50 and $30,500 for those 50 and older.",

    "fullText": "The rise of illegal off-roading throughout Rhode Island's management areas is reaching a boiling point for many local residents. As a result, some are urging officials to take immediate action to curb the problem before it causes irreparable harm to the region.\n\nAs ecoRI News reported, the use of all-terrain vehicles and dirt bikes inside state-managed lands, such as parks, forests, and wildlife refuges, is such a large issue that it has become impossible to ignore.\n\nRhode Island Department of Environmental Management spokesperson Evan LaCross reiterated that Rhode Island law prohibits all-terrain vehicles from operating inside management areas. LaCross notes that the DEM's Division of Law Enforcement has received around 1,660 reports of illegal off-roading in the last five years.\n\nHowever, Rhode Island residents say that nothing has stopped off-roaders. Andy Grover, an experienced hiker who enjoys exploring Rhode Island's scenic trails, described the growing concern with off-roading in these protected areas. According to Grover, the problem stems from a lack of enforcement.\n\n\"This stuff tends to be what happens when agencies are gutted,\" Grover said. \"The General Assembly needs to see that if they have the manpower, then you can say, 'Why aren't you patrolling?' Between the off-roading jetting through here and the logging, the forest is being destroyed.\"\n\nOff-roading in vulnerable management areas can cause untold damage to the landscape. Deep ruts left behind by all-terrain vehicles can lead to severe soil erosion and even habitat destruction for wildlife. Over time, this may disrupt vital ecosystems in the state.\n\nAn anonymous source shared two separate satellite images with ecoRI News that demonstrated just how prevalent the use of all-terrain vehicles has become throughout the region. The images revealed countless off-roading trails that not only affected Rhode Island, but neighboring Connecticut as well.\n\n\"Local officials are well aware of the activities that take place along these trails but short of patrolling them on a regular basis, there is not a lot they can do about it,\" the source wrote in an email sent to ecoRI News. \"A good part of these activities occur in the evenings and on weekends when there are very few RI DEM staff available.\"\n\nDo you think the government should ban gas-powered lawn tools?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Stocks rallied on Friday to cap a mixed week for the major averages in what served as the final full trading week of 2025.\n\nFor the week, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose about 0.4%, while the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell about 0.7% and the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) closed little changed.\n\nAll three major indexes will enter the final seven trading sessions of 2025 within 3% of their record highs.\n\nIn the week ahead, those investors still around during the holidays will turn their attention to the prospects of a \"Santa Claus rally,\" while a few pieces of economic data out on Tuesday will clean up some of the lagging data delayed as a result of the government shutdown.\n\nTuesday morning's read on consumer confidence from the Conference Board should be the key focus, with one of 2025's defining narratives centering on the K-shaped economy that has emerged among American shoppers.\n\nMarkets in the US will be open for half a day on Wednesday and closed on Thursday for Christmas. Many international markets will remain closed on Friday as well.\n\nAmerican consumers are heading into the holidays with a bit less joy than last year.\n\nWhile data from the University of Michigan released Friday showed a moderate uptick in consumer sentiment in December versus November, at 52.9 the index is 28.5% below last December's reading.\n\nSimilarly, housing sales ticked up for the third month in a row in November, but 2025 sales are looking likely to finish the year at a 25-year low, according to data from the National Association of Realtors.\n\n\"Consumers are loud and clear that they believe that the outlook for the economy has soured quite a bit since the beginning of the year,\" said Joanne Hsu, the director of the survey of consumers for the University of Michigan.\n\nWhile consumer spending has by and large held up throughout the back half of the year, according to Bank of America, US households in the upper third of incomes are driving more than half of that spending; around a quarter of households are living paycheck to paycheck.\n\n\"The ‘K-shaped’ economy makes for a fragmented consumer,\" said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial. \"The affluent are fine, if not thriving, while lower-income households struggle with high rent payments, rising delinquencies, and job uncertainty.\"\n\nPerhaps another reason why Thursday's inflation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics arrived as such a surprise.\n\nAt a 2.7% headline increase in prices over the last 12 months, the November reading came in significantly below expectations. The reading should give the Federal Reserve the vote of confidence it needs to cut rates again next year, building on a total 75 basis points' worth of cuts in 2025, said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank.",

    "description": "Jeffrey Epstein demanded that young girls show their school IDs to prove they were underage.",
    "fullText": "Jeffrey Epstein demanded that young girls show their school IDs to prove they were underage.\n\nMarina Lacerda, who was abused by Epstein from the age of 14, said the paedophile was “furious” when an 18-year-old was brought to him, immediately sending her away.\n\nMs Lacerda, now 37, was forced to recruit other victims, and told The Telegraph that Epstein instructed her to only present him with girls who had a student school ID.\n\nBrazilian-born Ms Lacerda said Epstein stopped abusing her when she was 16 or 17 because he thought she was too old and she was not bringing him girls who were young enough.\n\n“I did bring him somebody at the age of 18, and he booted her out... He just looked at her and knew she wasn’t the age of 14, 15, or 16. And he really, he was like, ‘Get the f--- out’... he was aggressive,” Ms Lacerda said.\n\n“He turned to me, and he was like, ‘I’m done.’ He’s like, ‘You need to start bringing me IDs when you bring girls here... I want school IDs.’”\n\nAfter the partial release of the Epstein files, Ms Lacerda accused the government of orchestrating a “cover-up” by redacting swathes of documents and failing to release everything it held to “protect” powerful men.\n\nThe US justice department released thousands of files on Friday and Saturday, but hundreds of pages were heavily redacted, and a huge tranche of documents is yet to be released.\n\nMs Lacerda’s testimony about being subjected to years of abuse was critical in securing the 2019 charges against the paedophile months before he died in jail.\n\nShe is referred to as “Minor-Victim 1” in the 2019 indictment and spoke publicly for the first time in September to call for the release of the Epstein files.\n\nShe said she had looked through some of the recently released files and saw notes about Epstein demanding to see girls’ IDs, information that appeared to be from her interview with the FBI in 2019, two months before Epstein’s arrest.\n\nOn Saturday, she also said the paedophile would “brag” to his powerful friends that he was being massaged by a “beautiful girl” while on a call, and make her say hello to them.\n\n“We did speak to a lot of people on the phone who were, you know, politicians, some were princes... [they] were very important people,” she told The Telegraph.\n\nHe would “make it clear that he knew everybody and he owned everybody... he manipulated us,” she said.\n\nAfter lying down for a massage, Epstein would ring his contacts to “talk business and would always bring up the fact like, ‘oh, you know, I have this nice, young, beautiful girl giving me a massage.’”\n\nHe would hand her the phone and tell her to “just say hello”, Ms Lacerda said. She would tell the men something like “Hey, how are you?” but would not discuss anything “deep”.\n\nMs Lacerda said Epstein never explicitly told the powerful men that she was underage.\n\nShe met one Hollywood star she had spoken to on the phone in person, but was not abused by them or anyone else, other than Epstein.\n\nMs Lacerda is one of a number of Epstein’s survivors who have been calling for the full release of the files, believing there is information about men in his orbit that has not been disclosed.\n\nOnly a fraction of the government’s files on the paedophile have been released, some of which have been heavily redacted, prompting bipartisan outcry about an alleged cover-up.\n\nAt least 16 files, including one photograph of Donald Trump, the US president, were also deleted from the justice department website after being published on Friday.\n\nIn Friday’s release, dozens of photographs of Bill Clinton, including one of the former US president topless in a hot tub, were published for the first time, as well as pictures showing Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor sprawled over the laps of five women with Ghislaine Maxwell grinning behind him at the Royal family’s Sandringham retreat.\n\n“There’s a reason why everything’s redacted,” Ms Lacerda said, adding that it was “100 per cent a total cover-up”.\n\n“It’s almost like a joke, right? Like, we have to look at it as it’s like, this has to be a comedy show. Like, why did you even put out all these files?”\n\nShe added: “Who are we really trying to protect? Are we protecting survivors, or are we protecting these powerful men?... We’re tired of it. It’s gotten to the point where, you know, we’ve protected these powerful men for a long time.”\n\nThere is no suggestion Mr Clinton has done anything wrong. The former president, who admits travelling on Epstein’s private plane, wrote in his memoir that he had “stopped contact” with Epstein before he was first arrested in 2005, for soliciting a child for prostitution.\n\nHe said that he always thought Epstein was “odd” but “had no inkling of the crimes he was committing”.\n\nMr Mountbatten-Windsor was ordered to leave Royal Lodge, his residence in Windsor, following weeks of scrutiny over his links to Epstein and Virginia Giuffre, his accuser. He has always denied the claims and any other wrongdoing.\n\nMs Lacerda met Epstein in 2002 when she was recruited by a friend, who did not give her details other than that she could make money massaging someone.\n\nMs Lacerda, a Brazilian immigrant, was sharing a single bedroom with her mother and sister at the time and saw it as an opportunity to support her family.\n\n“It got to the point where I think I got really desperate for money,” she said. However, she could not face working for him any more after being forced to recruit young girls.\n\nShe said: “I didn’t want to bring any more underage girls, being 17 and having some knowledge of what was really going on there.\n\n“You had no choice but to bring him somebody because he’s so persistent and just he wanted to have, you know, a new face, a new girl.”\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "description": "\"60 Minutes\" abruptly dropped a segment about Trump deportees sent to a megaprison in El Salvador Sunday — two hours before it was set to air.",
    "fullText": "“60 Minutes” abruptly pulled a segment Sunday on the Trump administration deporting hundreds of Venezuelan migrants to a megaprison in El Salvador, a stunning move that comes on the heels of President Donald Trump complaining that the CBS newsmagazine has “treated him far worse” under new management.\n\nFor days, CBS had been promoting Sunday’s segment, “Inside CECOT,” which promised to reveal “brutal and torturous conditions” inside El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center. Correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi had spoken to now released deportees, according to a Friday press release. But the segment was pulled Sunday evening, around two hours before it was to set to air.\n\n“The 60 Minutes report on ‘Inside CECOT’ will air in a future broadcast,” CBS told TheWrap in a statement. “We determined it needed additional reporting.”\n\nAlfonsi sent an indignant internal memo to colleagues saying that pulling the segment “is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.” The memo was immediately leaked.\n\nShe wrote: “If the standard for airing a story is that ‘the government must agree to be interviewed,’ then the government effectively gains control over the 60 Minutes broadcast. We go from an investigative powerhouse to a stenographer for the state.”\n\nHere is Sharyn Alfonsi’s email to her ‘60 Minutes’ colleagues in full: pic.twitter.com/ilGoSROQEs\n\n— Michael M. Grynbaum (@grynbaum) December 22, 2025\n\nAlfonsi said the segment had been screened and fact-checked by CBS lawyers and Standards and Practices. Editor-in-chief Bari Weiss, who watched it Friday, decided to hold it.\n\nWeiss responded on Sunday: “My job is to make sure that all stories we publish are the best they can be. Holding stories that aren’t ready for whatever reason—that they lack sufficient context, say, or that they are missing critical voices—happens every day in every newsroom. I look forward to airing this important piece when it’s ready.”\n\nBut the decision to pull such a heavily promoted and presumably hard-hitting segment on the Trump administration is sure to come under intense scrutiny given the president’s recent comments about “60 Minutes” and his relationship with David Ellison, who now runs CBS News-parent Paramount.\n\nSocial media exploded on Sunday night with criticism of Weiss, declaring that she had failed her own standard that she announced in ascending to the role of running CBS News, “to seek the truth and tell it plainly.”\n\n“If this decision is not reversed, if CBS News will only run a piece if WH comments, giving them veto power over journalism, any staff member w integrity will likely quit, bc it isn’t a news division anymore. It’s TASS,” said veteran reporter Bill Carter, referring to the Soviet-era news agency.\n\nIf this decision is not reversed, if CBS News will only run a piece if WH comments, giving them veto power over journalism, any staff member w integrity will likely quit, bc it isn't a news division anymore. It's TASS. https://t.co/RjjZNX7nHm\n\n— Bill Carter (@wjcarter) December 22, 2025\n\nBut “60 Minutes” has lately run afoul of Trump yet again. Earlier this month, after “60 Minutes” aired an interview with his former ally turned critic Marjorie Taylor Greene, Trump referenced the settlement in taking aim at ownership.\n\nLast week, Trump unloaded again, “For those people that think I am close with the new owners of CBS, please understand that ‘60 Minutes’ has treated me far worse since the so-called ‘takeover,’ than they have ever treated me before. If they are friends, I’d hate to see my enemies.”\n\nTrump sued CBS last year over how “60 Minutes” edited an interview with his then-2024 rival, Kamala Harris. The network initially dismissed Trump’s suit as “without merit” and vowed to “vigorously defend” itself. But CBS-parent Paramount settled with Trump for $16 million in July as the company was seeking FCC approval to merge with Ellison’s Skydance.\n\nSince the merger, Ellison appointed Weiss, the co-founder of the Free Press, to serve as editor-in-chief. Trump has praised Weiss in the past, as well as Ellison, who is now vying to takeover Warner Bros. Discovery, the parent company of CNN. Ellison’s father, billionaire Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, is a Trump supporter.\n\nTrump returned to “60 Minutes” last month for his first interview since the settlement. “I see good things happening in the news. I really do. And I think one of the best things to happen is this show and new ownership, CBS and new ownership,” Trump said. “I think it’s the greatest thing that’s happened in a long time to a free and open and good press.”\n\nWatch a teaser for the “60 Minutes” segment below:\n\nHere's the deleted trailer for the now-\"delayed\" segment. It's almost impressive how much damage Bari Weiss has done to CBS News in such a short period of time. \n\nSomeone quickly schedule a prime-time Town Hall with Alan Dershowitz to rectify the harm:pic.twitter.com/382gRG5Lgp https://t.co/3gHRKNES2y\n\n— Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) December 21, 2025\n\nThe post ‘60 Minutes’ Abruptly Pulls Segment on Trump Deportees Sent to El Salvador Megaprison appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Dec 22 (Reuters) - A revamp of China's electricity market is boosting the economics of storing power just as international demand surges, sparking a boom for the Chinese energy storage manufacturers that already dominate globally.\n\nChinese firms are on track for a 75% jump this year in global shipments of lithium-ion battery cells for energy storage, ​according to one estimate.\n\nThey have exported more than $65 billion worth of storage and electric-vehicle batteries this year, cementing their dominance in a sector vital to backing up wind and solar ‌and keeping power coursing through artificial-intelligence data centres.\n\nThe surge in sales is driven by data centres and renewables domestically, as well as by Chinese reforms and subsidies that are boosting general demand for energy storage. International demand is rising in tandem with the ‌surging growth in data centres, a need to back up Europe's ageing grid and China's burgeoning renewable energy business in the Middle East, analysts say.\n\n\"These leading energy storage cell makers, they have full orders. Many of them are basically working double shifts now to try and meet demand,\" said analyst Cosimo Ries at policy research firm Trivium China. The boom \"is one of the biggest surprises of the year, I think, in China's energy space.\"\n\nUBS last month raised its 2026 forecast for global battery-energy storage installations by 25%.\n\nThe International Energy Agency forecasts global investment in battery storage facilities will rise 16% this year to $66 billion. Much of that is ⁠set to be captured by Chinese firms because while Tesla is number ‌one in energy storage systems, China dominates production of the tiny cells inside them.\n\nAll of the six top global cell suppliers - Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd (CATL), HiTHIUM, EVE Energy, BYD, CALB and REPT BATTERO - are Chinese, according to a January-to-September ranking by consultancy Infolink. Of the top 10, only Japan's AESC is not from China.\n\nEVE's ‍energy storage sales volumes rose 35.51% in the first three quarters from the same period last year. REPT BATTERO's third-quarter shipments of all batteries set a record high. Top EV players CATL and BYD did not break out energy storage shipments through the third quarter. Storage has historically made up less of their revenue than automotive batteries and EVs, although the proportion is growing.\n\n\"Pairing solar with storage has effectively become the only solution for meeting U.S. AI ​data-centre power needs,\" UBS analyst Yishu Yan told a media briefing. \"U.S. AI data centre power demand is very robust, but power is the biggest bottleneck, and U.S. baseload power - gas, nuclear, thermal - they ‌won't grow much in the next five years.\"",

    "fullText": "A White House envoy said Sunday he held “productive and constructive” talks in Florida with Ukrainian and European representatives to end the nearly four-year war between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nPosting on social media, Steve Witkoff said the talks aimed at aligning on a shared strategic approach between Ukraine, the United States and Europe.\n\n“Our shared priority is to stop the killing, ensure guaranteed security, and create conditions for Ukraine’s recovery, stability, and long-term prosperity. Peace must be not only a cessation of hostilities, but also a dignified foundation for a stable future,\" U.S. President Donald Trump's envoy said.\n\nThe talks are part of the Trump administration’s monthslong push for peace. Trump has unleashed an extensive diplomatic push to end the war, but his efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands by Moscow and Kyiv. Putin has recently signaled he is digging in on his maximalist demands on Ukraine, as Moscow’s troops inch forward on the battlefield despite huge losses.\n\nWitkoff's assessment comes as negotiations have been proceeding with Russia as well. A Kremlin envoy said Saturday that the talks were pressing on “constructively” in Florida.\n\n“The discussions are proceeding constructively. They began earlier and will continue today, and will also continue tomorrow,” Kirill Dmitriev told reporters in Miami on Saturday. There were no immediate updates on the talks with Russia on Sunday.\n\nDmitriev met with Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported.\n\nFor Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram Sunday that diplomatic efforts were “moving forward quite quickly, and our team in Florida has been working with the American side.”\n\nThe Kremlin denied Sunday that trilateral talks involving Ukraine, Russia and the U.S. were under discussion, after Zelenskyy said Saturday that Washington had proposed the idea of three-way discussions.\n\n“At present, no one has seriously discussed this initiative, and to my knowledge it is not being prepared,” Russian President Vladimir Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov said, according to Russian state news agencies.\n\nUkrainian civilians moved to Russia\n\nIn Ukraine, the country’s human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets on Sunday accused Russian forces of forcibly removing about 50 Ukrainian civilians from the Ukrainian Sumy border region to Russian territory.\n\nWriting on Telegram, he said that Russian forces illegally detained the residents in the village of Hrabovske on Thursday, before moving them to Russia on Saturday.\n\nLubinets said he contacted Russia’s human rights commissioner, requesting information on the civilians’ whereabouts and conditions, and demanding their immediate return to Ukraine.\n\nThe French presidency on Sunday welcomed Putin’s willingness to speak with President Emmanuel Macron, saying it would decide how to proceed “in the coming days.”\n\n“As soon as the prospect of a ceasefire and peace negotiations becomes clearer, it becomes useful again to speak with Putin,” Macron’s office said in a statement. “It is welcome that the Kremlin publicly agrees to this approach.”\n\nThe statement came after reports that Putin was open to holding talks with the French president if there was mutual political will.\n\nEuropean Union leaders agreed on Friday to provide 90 billion euros ($106 billion) to Ukraine to meet its military and economic needs for the next two years, although they failed to bridge differences with Belgium that would have allowed them to use frozen Russian assets to raise the funds. Instead, they were borrowed from capital markets.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump has fueled new speculation about his health after an awkward descent on Air Force One’s stairs.\n\nA video of the 79-year-old president exiting the plane at Palm Beach International Airport on Saturday morning, posted by MAGA influencer Paul Villarreal, has drawn attention online for Trump’s odd hand movement and slow, careful descent.\n\nIn the video, Trump appears at the aircraft door and slaps his right leg three times with his right hand before heading down the stairs. He cautiously navigates the steps while gripping tightly onto the railing, taking about 18 seconds to reach the bottom of the short staircase.\n\nPresident Trump exited Air Force One tonight in West Palm Beach. He is headed to Mar-a-Lago.\n. pic.twitter.com/Z4vBY8qobw\n\n— Paul Villarreal (AKA Vince Manfeld) (@AureliusStoic1) December 20, 2025\n\nHe then plops into “The Beast,” the heavily armored presidential car, where he is seen drinking what appears to be a Diet Coke. Trump is spending Christmas at his Mar-a-Lago estate.\n\nCritics online were quick to note the president’s apparent frailty and peculiar leg-slapping.\n\n“Tapping that leg to make sure it works going down,” one X user commented.\n\nAnother wrote, “I wish he concentrated on the economy like he concentrated on going down those stairs.”\n\nOne person hypothesized about his hand motions, “It is not his leg he is touching, but he is trying to get life back into his hand.”\n\nThe elderly president’s supporters defended him, however, with many pointing out that Trump had just wrapped up a long day, including a rally in Rocky Mount, North Carolina.\n\nTrump—who was filmed stumbling on Air Force One’s stairs during a visit to New Jersey in June this year—has frequently spoken about being “very careful” about walking down stairs to avoid the perils of his predecessor, Joe Biden.\n\n“I’m very careful. You know, when I walk downstairs—like I’m on stairs like these stairs—I walk very slowly,“ Trump said while addressing the nation’s top generals in September.\n\nA few days later, he brought up the subject again while taking shots at Biden during a speech to Navy sailors.\n\n“We had a horrible, horrible president who had no clue what the hell was happening. The chances of him walking down those stairs successfully were not good,” he said. “And I have to be careful because one day I’m gonna probably fall.”\n\nThe commander-in-chief then revealed what he apparently tells himself while walking down stairs: “I always say, ‘Walk down the steps nice and slowly.’ You ever notice? I don’t have to bop down the stairs. ‘Walk nice and slowly.’”\n\nQuestions around Trump’s health have dogged him in his second term, particularly after he let slip that he had undergone an MRI scan in October.\n\nThe White House eventually said it was a “preventative” look at his heart and abdomen, a claim met with skepticism from medical experts who stressed that there was “nothing standard” about the scan.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",

    "fullText": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump ‍on Sunday ​announced ​he ⁠is appointing Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry to serve as the U.S. ‌special envoy to Greenland, the vast, semi-autonomous territory of Denmark that Trump has said the U.S. needs to take over.\n\n“Jeff understands how essential Greenland is to our National Security, and will strongly advance our Country’s Interests for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Allies, and indeed, the World,” Trump said in announcing the appointment.\n\nTrump during his presidential transition and in the early months of his return to the White House repeatedly called for U.S. jurisdiction over Greenland, and has not ruled out military force to take control of the mineral-rich, strategically located Arctic island.\n\nThe issue had drifted out of the headlines in recent months, but in August, Danish officials summoned the U.S. ambassador following a report that at least three people with connections to Trump had carried out covert influence operations in Greenland.\n\nEarlier this year, Vice President JD Vance visited a remote U.S. military base on the island and accused Denmark of underinvesting there.\n\nTrump has said that Greenland is crucial for U.S. security and hasn’t ruled out taking the island by military force, even though Denmark is a NATO ally of the U.S.\n\nLandry took office as governor in January 2024. His term ends in January 2028.\n\n“It's an honor to serve you in this volunteer position to make Greenland a part of the U.S.,” Landry wrote in a posting on X in which he thanked Trump for the appointment. He added, \"This in no way affects my position as Governor of Louisiana!”\n\nDenmark, a NATO ally of the U.S., and Greenland have said the island is not for sale and condemned reports of the U.S. gathering intelligence there. The U.S. push for Greenland is also opposed by Russia and much of Europe.\n\nThe Embassy of Denmark in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment about Landry's appointment.\n\nThe Danish Defense Intelligence Service said in a report earlier this month that the United States is using its economic power to “assert its will” and threaten military force against friend and foe alike.\n\nThe service, in its annual assessment, said Washington’s greater assertiveness under the Trump administration also comes as China and Russia seek to diminish Western, especially American, influence.\n\n\"The strategic importance of the Arctic is rising as the conflict between Russia and the West intensifies, and the growing security and strategic focus on the Arctic by the United States will further accelerate these developments,” the report said.",

    "description": "The story behind Wales-based Wunda Group, which designs and supplies energy-efficient underfloor heating systems.",
    "fullText": "When entrepreneurs Charles and Josephine Pugh rented a property with \"uncomfortable and uncontrollable\" underfloor heating (UFH), it sparked a move away from the made-to-order furniture world they had been invested in since the late 1970s.\n\nThe couple, who had founded British retailer Multiyork in 1978, set up Wunda Group in 2006 at the height of the 'green homes revolution' when barn conversions and self-builds were de rigueur.\n\nThe Pughs’ home heating issue had centred on underfloor screed — a level layer of concrete where piping has traditionally been embedded into — with pipe centres too far apart. With no controls, there was a slow response time to heat and the floor became too hot. The Pughs thought the existing systems were \"slow and antiquated\".\n\nMonmouthshire-based Wunda now designs and supplies energy-efficient UFH systems and has cut through to the DIY consumer at a time of rising energy bills. The company employs 90 staff and says it has booked over £10m in sales this year.\n\nThe heating firm is also a family affair. With Charles as CEO and Josephine CFO, their daughter Josephine is managing director, while grandson Sam Jump is currently head of business development.\n\nThe business took off in 2008 when Wunda reorientated as installers looked for kits and components after the self-build market collapsed.\n\nIn 2010, their former base near Chepstow was in an old chicken farm shed renovated to offices. The Pughs still visited trade shows and had come across one American exhibitor’s aluminum chip board panel with grooves, which was employed as a last fix in the build.\n\nThey pioneered a version with high-compressed polystyrene and put a sample down in the chicken shed, with a heat pump which moved outside thermal energy internally. The closer piping also meant it could be run at lower temperatures.\n\nJump, who was working in the warehouse at the time and previously led a team of outreachers offering membership, recalled: “Everyone was walking around in T-shirts during winter and the response rate was unreal, the heat pump was operating at the optimum flow temperature with a co-efficient performance.”\n\nHowever, their product was initially met with scepticism from installers unwilling to test new products. “Where most people think of UFH as this uncomfortable system, we now have a rapid response system and it warms up as fast as radiators, if not quicker.”\n\nA booming DIY industry, renovating homes or building extensions instead of moving, has helped boost Wunda’s profits.",

    "fullText": "Palantir (PLTR) trades at 552 times trailing earnings and 175 times forward earnings. Bank of America set a $255 price target.\n\nMichael Burry bought $9.2 million in Palantir put options at a $50 strike price expiring in 2027.\n\nPalantir maintains a 50% free cash flow margin with full-year FCF estimated at $2.1 billion.\n\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nMichael Burry has been butting heads with the bulls on Wall Street, specifically regarding Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR). The bulls have won big so far, and the price targets have gotten even bolder. On the other hand, most analysts are sitting on the fence with a \"Hold\" rating, with three analysts having \"Sell\" ratings on the stock. There are four \"Strong Buy\" ratings, with the highest price target at $255, from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).\n\nBurry believes PLTR stock may be on the cusp of an implosion, with his bearish thesis focusing on the sky-high valuation of the stock. PLTR stock trades at 156 times trailing sales and at 552 times trailing earnings. It still trades at 175 times next year's expected earnings, which is an unprecedented valuation that no other big tech stock has seen since the Dot Com era.\n\nThis may be old news by now, but it's worth a refresher before we get to the meat.\n\nBurry holds put options on approximately 5 million Palantir shares, with a notional value of around $912 million. This is the largest bearish bet in his portfolio and constitutes 66% of his reported holdings. The true amount involved is much lower. Burry himself posted on X, saying that he spent $9.2 million buying 50,000 put options on Palantir.\n\nThese options expire in 2027 at a strike price of $50. Burry is betting that PLTR stock will decline well below $50, allowing him to sell higher at the strike price when it expires.\n\nRegardless, this is a drop in the bucket compared to how much Burry's spending power. The notional value did lead to dramatic headlines and lured in comments from Palantir CEO Alex Karp, who called Burry \"batshit crazy\" during an interview.\n\nThe bulls' argument is essentially that Palantir is an extraordinary company that deserves an extraordinary valuation. It has managed to grow significantly after getting its foot in the door at any company/agency. What truly makes this growth special is that the company has a free cash flow margin of nearly 50%. For a company believed to be early on in its growth cycle, Palantir is truly exceptional.",

    "description": "A look at the Patriots’ game day roster for their Week 16 game on Sunday night.",
    "fullText": "With Robert Spillane sidelined throughout the game, the New England Patriots’ linebacker group had a disappointing outing last week versus the Buffalo Bills. The challenge will not be any easier for the position on Sunday night against the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nNot only will Spillane miss a second straight game because of an ankle injury, the Ravens feature one of the best run games in the NFL. Led by the two-headed monster of quarterback Lamar Jackson and running back Derrick Henry, they are entering Sunday as the league leaders in yards per carry (5.2).\n\nWith Spillane out, that means the task on stopping this potent an attack will fall on replacement starting duo Jack Gibbens and Christian Elliss. As head coach Mike Vrabel pointed out on Friday, however, they will not be the only one in the spotlight.\n\n“Everybody that goes to the game is going to play and have a role, and we ask everybody to prepare as starters,” Vrabel explained. “That’s something that’s important. And so, Gibby will start in there, and then different guys will play, packages and everything else.”\n\nNew England’s full game day roster against the Ravens looks as follows:\n\nQuarterback (2): Drake Maye (10), Joshua Dobbs (11)\n\nRunning back (4): Rhamondre Stevenson (38), TreVeyon Henderson (32), D’Ernest Johnson (34), Jack Westover (37 | FB/TE)\n\nWide receiver (5): Kayshon Boutte (9), Stefon Diggs (8), Mack Hollins (13), DeMario Douglas (3), Kyle Williams (18 | KR)\n\nTight end (2): Hunter Henry (85), Austin Hooper (81)\n\nOffensive tackle (3): Vederian Lowe (59 | LT), Morgan Moses (76 | RT), Thayer Munford Jr. (74)\n\nInterior offensive line (5): Jared Wilson (58 | LG), Garrett Bradbury (65 | C), Mike Onwenu (71 | RG), Ben Brown (77), Caedan Wallace (70)\n\nInterior defensive line (5): Christian Barmore (90), Khyiris Tonga (95 | FB), Cory Durden (94), Eric Gregory (55), Joshua Farmer (92)\n\nDefensive edge (5): Harold Landry III (2), K’Lavon Chaisson (44), Elijah Ponder (91), Anfernee Jennings (33), Bradyn Swinson (43)\n\nLinebacker (5): Jack Gibbens (51), Christian Elliss (53), Jahlani Tavai (48), Marte Mapu (15), Chad Muma (49)\n\nCornerback (5): Christian Gonzalez (0), Carlton Davis III (7), Marcus Jones (25 | PR), Charles Woods (22), Miles Battle (35)\n\nSafety (4): Jaylinn Hawkins (21), Craig Woodson (31), Dell Pettus (24), Brenden Schooler (41)\n\nSpecialists (3): Andy Borregales (36 | K), Bryce Baringer (17 | P/H), Julian Ashby (47 | LS)\n\nThe Patriots’ front seven is seeing some changes compared to last week. Not only is Chad Muma active as extra depth at linebacker and on special teams just five days after getting claimed off waivers from the Indianapolis Colts, two recent inactives are also up this week: Eric Gregory will provide additional depth at defensive tackle, while Bradyn Swinson should help on the edge.\n\nSwinson’s presence on the game day roster comes in light of starter Harold Landry being questionable with a knee injury. The fifth-round rookie has appeared in one game so far, playing 10 snaps in the kicking game but none on defense.\n\nInactives (5): QB3 Tommy DeVito (16), WR Efton Chism III (86), TE C.J. Dippre (82), OT Marcus Bryant (52), LB Robert Spillane (14)\n\nPractice squad (16): RB Jashaun Corbin (30), WR John Jiles (83), WR Jeremiah Webb (29), OL Sebastian Gutierrez (72), OL Andrew Rupcich (67), OL Brenden Jaimes (61), OL Mehki Butler (63), DT Jeremiah Pharms Jr. (98), DT Leonard Taylor III (93), DT Fabien Lovett Sr. (96), LB Amari Gainer (45), LB Otis Reese (54), CB Brandon Crossley (46), CB Kobee Minor (19), S Richie Grant (39), S John Saunders Jr. (23)\n\nPractice squad/exempt (1): TE Thomas Odukoya (88 | IPPP)\n\nPractice squad/injured (2): RB Craig Reynolds, LB Darius Harris\n\nReserve/injured (11): FB Brock Lampe, OT Yasir Durant, CB Marcellas Dial Jr., DT Jaquelin Roy, RB Lan Larison, RB Deneric Prince, DT Isaiah Iton, RB Antonio Gibson, DT Milton Williams, CB Alex Austin, OT Will Campbell, RB Terrell Jennings\n\nReserve/retired (1): OL Wes Schweitzer\n\nWith no players elevated from the practice squad, a total of five players were ruled out on Sunday. The list includes no surprises, with Spillane, who was deemed inactive ahead of the weekend already, as the only noteworthy absence.\n\nThe Patriots’ game against the Ravens will kick off at 8:20 p.m. ET at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore.",

    "fullText": "The Denver Broncos rolled into Week 16 against the Jacksonville Jaguars riding an 11-game win streak with visions of clinching the No. 1 seed in the AFC playoffs.\n\nThe Jaguars had other ideas. Sparked by another big game from quarterback Trevor Lawrence, the Jaguars steamrolled the vaunted Broncos' defense in Denver to secure a 34-20 win.\n\nWith the win, the Jaguars improve to 11-4 while turning the race for the No. 1 seed in the AFC into a five-team contest. The Broncos drop to 12-3, while the 11-4 Chargers, 11-4 Bills and 11-3 Patriots (ahead of Sunday night's game against the Ravens) all remain in the race for the first-round bye in the AFC playoff bracket.\n\nLawrence led the way while completing 23 of 36 passes for for 279 yards with 3 touchdowns and no interceptions. He added 20 yards and a fourth touchdown on the ground.\n\nThis, a week after Lawrence led a 48-20 romp over the Jets with 330 passing yards, 5 touchdowns and no turnovers. But that was against the Jets.\n\nSunday was against a Super Bowl-contending Broncos team with one of the best defenses in football. And if you weren't counting the Jaguars among Super Bowl contenders before, it's time to reconsider that stance.\n\nThe early portion of Sunday's contest was a back-and-forth affair that saw the Broncos tie the game at 17-17 early in the third quarter. But the tenor of the game took a dramatic shift on Jacksonville's first possession of the second half.\n\nSparked by a pair of big penalties, the Jaguars drove 75 yards for a touchdown. A roughing the passing penalty for bodyweight on a hit of Lawrence on first down moved the Jaguars across midfield and riled up the raucous Denver crowd.\n\nThen in the red zone on second down, the Broncos got flagged for pass interference in the end zone when Jahdae Barron grabbed Parker Washington's arm while the ball was in the air. This brought the home crowd into a frenzy.\n\nLawrence responded by running untouched into the end zone for 24-17 lead Jaguars lead.\n\nBack and forth we goooo@trevorlawrence | #JAXvsDEN on FOXpic.twitter.com/ySt0CgOLMW\n\n— Jacksonville Jaguars (@Jaguars) December 21, 2025\n\nThe Broncos had multiple chances to answer, but there was no Bo Nix magic in the second half this time.\n\nDenver punted after four plays on its ensuing possession. Following another Jaguars touchdown for a 31-17 lead, a botched handoff from Nix to Jaleel McLaughlin resulted in Denver's first turnover of the game. The Jaguars converted that fumble into a field goal for a 34-17 lead.\n\nThen with 8:08 remaining, Nix forced a sideline pass to Pat Bryant in tight coverage. Jarrian Jones was there for the interception to all but ice the Jacksonville win.\n\nBo Nix is intercepted by Jarrian Jones 👀\n\n📺 FOX pic.twitter.com/4pNMf0lkHU\n\n— FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) December 21, 2025\n\nFor the day, Nix completed 28 of 47 passes for 352 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception. He was credited with a lost fumble on the botched handoff in the third quarter. And the Jaguars finished the game with a 2-0 advantage in takeaways. Those turnovers ultimately tanked any hope of a Broncos comeback.\n\nEven with the loss, the Broncos maintain control of that No. 1 seed. Their 12-3 record remains alone atop the AFC. And they hold the tiebreaker over the Patriots if the Patriots win Sunday night.\n\nBut with two weeks remaining in the season, the race for that No. 1 seed is anything but settled. And the Chargers could still win the AFC West. The Broncos and Chargers will face off in Week 18, when the division title could be at stake.",

Nix then threw a short pass to running back Tyler Badie, who went down after two yards, sealing a 34-20 loss for the Broncos.\n\nBryant had five catches for 42 yards before suffering the injury. The third-round pick out of Illinois had totaled 22 receptions for 305 yards and one score going into the game.\n\nSocial: Follow Broncos Wire on Facebook and Twitter/X! Did you know: These 25 celebrities are Broncos fans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Broncos Wire: NFL news: Broncos WR Pat Bryant carted off field vs. Jaguars",

    "fullText": "We are three months into the NBA season, and the two former superstars for Rutgers men’s basketball are proving why they were drafted high and are showing potential to dominate the league for years to come.\n\nAce Bailey, despite a slower start to the season, is playing his best basketball as of late. Bailey started the year by averaging 4.4 points per game in October. However, in the two months since then, Bailey has averaged 12.1 points in November and 11.5 points in December. He has already had three 20-point games and has all but three games in double-digit points in December. He has recorded several highlight-worthy shots, including the one below.\n\nBailey still has a lot of development to do to reach his maximum potential in the NBA. If his time so far is any indication, he is on an upward trajectory to reach that level. He was viewed as an all-around project when he was drafted by the Jazz. In particular, his field goal shooting percentage, defense, and rebounding still need a lot of work. Regardless, he has looked better and better with each passing game.\n\nHERE COMES ACE BAILEY ‼️\n\nTHE ROOK JUST ROCKED THE RIM IN UTAH.\n\nTap to watch: https://t.co/nnbneYnnKu pic.twitter.com/2bnTNCCWqB\n\nArguably, the more NBA-ready of the two when they declared for the draft, Dylan Harper has already demonstrated an ability to take over games, despite playing in the NBA for less than three whole months. Against Washington earlier in the month, Harper recorded 24 points and five rebounds in San Antonio’s dominating 119-94 win over the Wizards. This is not the first time this season he has recorded a similar stat line, as he has recorded games with 20 or more points and six or more rebounds two other times.\n\nHarper is averaging 48.2 percent on field goals, which is just above the average for NBA players, which has been 46.9 percent this season. However, this three-point percentage needs some work, as he is averaging 30.2 percent per game this season when the league average for three-point percentage per game is 35.8 percent.\n\nDylan Harper 24 Points, 5 Rebs, 3 Assists full highlight vs Wizards I 25-26 NBA Season pic.twitter.com/XfqF8sWvYR\n\n— Hoops Showtime (@HoopsShowtime12) December 19, 2025\n\nBoth have shown their ability to score so far in this league. Now they need to prove that they can be contributors in the other statistics. Those will likely start to click as they get more experience on an NBA court.\n\nRon Harper Jr. has spent most of his time this season on the Boston Celtics G League squad, the Maine Celtics. However, he has been called up to the main roster a few times, where he was largely used as a rotational piece due to injuries. Harper has seen action in four NBA games this season, seeing 20 minutes on the floor across all four. He has 8 points so far this season, with six of them coming in the Celtics game against the Memphis Grizzlies. He has three rebounds on the year as well, all of which came against Houston.",

    "fullText": "Toronto Blue Jays President and CEO Mark Shapiro believes the Boston Red Sox could be the team to beat.\n\nThe Red Sox made the playoffs last season and have been active this offseason, adding the likes of Sonny Gray and Johan Oviedo to round out their pitching staff.\n\nYet, Boston is still led by a young core that features the likes of Roman Anthony, Marcelo Mayer, and Cedanne Rafaela, while Garrett Crochet is the team’s ace. With that, Shapiro believes no team is better set up for the next five years than the Red Sox.\n\n“Boston is probably positioned as well as any team in all of Major League Baseball,” Shapiro said on MLB Network Radio on Sunday. “I don’t know if there is a team that is positioned for the next five years better than the Boston Red Sox with young talent and flexibility.”\n\nIt’s a bold take from the Blue Jays CEO, as the Red Sox are a division rival of Toronto, but Shapiro clearly likes what he sees from Boston.\n\nWith Shapiro expecting the Red Sox to be better, he knows the AL East will be a tough division to win this year.\n\n“We already knew Baltimore was going to be better than they were last year,” Shapiro added. “All you have to do is look at them in the second half. They clearly have gotten better with Taylor Ward, with Shane Baz, and others.\n\n“They’ve had a good offseason, and I don’t think they are done. The Yankees are clearly, you know, they are not done. Tampa is going to be better; they are never bad, they are going to be better.”\n\nAlthough Shapiro believes everyone in the AL East will be better, his comments about the Red Sox stand out.\n\nRed Sox Reportedly Swing Huge Trade For Three-Time All-Star",

    "title": "Instant reaction: Broncos’ defense fizzles out as Jaguars route Denver 34-20",
    "description": "The Denver Broncos had their 11-game winning streak come to an end with their 34-20 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars.",
    "fullText": "The Denver Broncos hosted the roaring Jacksonville Jaguars in their Week 16 matchup. A gridiron battle of two division leaders, this one was expected to be a close and hard-fought matchup. It turned out to be the opposite, with the Jaguars throttling the Broncos 34-20 and ending their 11-game winning streak. Here are some instant reactions and key takeaways from today’s game.\n\nPenalties, drops, and miscues plague Broncos’ offensive effort\n\nLast week against the Green Bay Packers, Bo Nix and the offense had one of their most complete games of the season. In order to defeat the Jaguars, they needed to replicate some of that success. Sadly, that was far from the case with only several good drives through sixty minutes of play.\n\nAfter struggling in the first quarter, they were able muster a quality scoring drive early on in the second quarter. A 15-yard fade to Courtland Sutton tied the game up. A few drives later, Wil Lutz was able to connect on a 54-yard field goal to give the Broncos a 10-7 lead—but that was short-lived with Denver being down 17-10 at halftime.\n\nDenver’s first drive of the second half couldn’t have gone any better. Rookie running back RJ Harvey broke a few tackles and dove for the pylon to cap off a 38-yard touchdown scamper that tied the game up at 17. It was an absolutely marvelous play by the second-round pick. After that? There wasn’t much to write home about.\n\nThree-and-outs and stalled drives were a theme for the Broncos thereafter. A failed handoff exchange between Nix and Jaleel McLaughlin late in the third quarter was the straw that broke the camel’s back with Denver already down 31-17. In the fourth quarter down 34-20, Nix threw an interception on fourth down that officially ended any hopes of a miracle comeback.\n\nPenalties, drops, turnovers, and miscues all played a culprit in the Broncos’ regression on offense against the Jaguars. Ther only bright spot on offense was Harvey’s performance. It was in a losing effort, but over 120 all-purpose yards and a touchdown is praiseworthy. The team will continue to need him to play at a high level in the final weeks of the season to help secure the division title and top seed in the AFC.\n\nJarrian Jones picks off Nix!\n\nJAXvsDEN on FOX/FOX Onehttps://t.co/HkKw7uXnxV pic.twitter.com/F9MjGz2RRZ\n\nDefense fails to show up in worst performance of the season\n\nThe Jaguars entered today’s contest averaging well over 30 points a game since their bye week. Both Trevor Lawrence and Travis Etienne were on hot streaks. It was a big task for the Broncos to slow them down. Unfortunately, they struggled all game long and had their worst performance of the year. It was ugly throughout four quarters.\n\nOne area of concern I had was how safety P.J. Locke would hold up in coverage. He surrendered a touchdown reception to tight end Brenton Strange in the second quarter—aided by a clear push off by Strange. However, he was also targeted often on the Jaguars’ scoring drive right before halftime and also in the second half. It’s clear that Brandon Jones’ presence in the backend of Denver’s secondary was sorely missed.\n\nOn top of that, Lawrence was able to light up the Broncos’ red zone defense. Entering today’s game, Denver’s red zone defense was best in the NFL in ‘25 and a huge strength. Today? They gave up four touchdowns in Jacksonville’s first four trips inside the 20. That’s certainly not a recipe for success. It was Murphy’s Law for the Broncos on defense this afternoon.\n\nMissed tackles, missed coverage assignments, and penalties hampered Denver’s ability to thwart Jacksonville’s offensive endeavors. The Jaguars were routinely able to create yards after the catch and blow past Broncos defenders. It’s been a long time since we have seen them play this poorly. But perhaps a wakeup call was eventually in order. It’s really not worth mentioning ‘elite’ and this defense in the same sentence any longer.\n\nAfter multiple weeks of showing concerning weaknesses, all of the Broncos’ biggest flaws were exposed today. With only two games remaining before the playoffs, the team doesn’t have long to correct them. If they can’t, their hopes of a strong postseason push may be in jeopardy. Defensive Coordinator Vance Joseph and his players have their work cut out for them.\n\nThis Bronco Defense is all kinds of out of sorts. \n\nBusting coverages, not setting edges, no QB player on obvious Zone Read situations. \n\nTrevor Lawrence & Liam Cohen continue to punch the bruise. \n\nThe Brandon Jones loss looms larger than I would have expected.\n\n— Coach Mike Sanford (@Coach_Sanford2) December 21, 2025\n\nDenver can’t let this loss linger. Recalibrate and beat the Chiefs on Christmas.\n\nAll good things come to an end. It’s been an awesome season for the Broncos, but their eleven-game winning streak is now over. Getting pummeled at home by the Jaguars wasn’t on the radar for me. I thought the Broncos would win in a close game.\n\nA huge credit to Jacksonville for being the better team today. They executed a great gameplan on both sides of the ball. They also delivered Denver their first loss at home since October of last season. That’s pretty wild when you think about it.\n\nThat being said, the Broncos can’t afford to dwell on this loss and let it linger. They need to shift gears quickly and be prepared to defeat the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium on Christmas. There usually isn’t a good way to spin a loss, but this sort of adversity might be important for the Broncos to experience before the postseason hits.\n\nIt can serve as a bit of a reality check for them. Moreover, it’s certainly a woeful performance where there will be ample tape to show what they need to correct and improve upon. The next two games are against division rivals. They are must-win games for Denver to win the AFC West and find a way to edge out the competition for that coveted first-round bye and homefield advantage that comes with the #1 seed.\n\nWill the Broncos be able to show some tenacity and resiliency over the next two weeks? I sure hope so. So much is at stake. Let’s hope they can finish off the season strong with back-to-back wins. Although it isn’t going to be easy, especially with Pat Bryant and Dre Greenlaw being injured late in today’s game.\n\nProbably a good time to note that the Broncos can lose today and still get the No. 1 seed with 2 wins.\n\nAnd also that every time they've won the SB they've had back-to-back December losses. (Not saying you want that here, because that means losing to a KC team w/ its No. 3 QB)\n\n— Andrew Mason (@MaseDenver) December 21, 2025",

    "fullText": "Things went from bad to worse for the Kansas City Chiefs at the quarterback position on Sunday against the Tennessee Titans.\n\nThe Chiefs had already taken a major blow as they lost starting quarterback and multi-time Super Bowl Champion Patrick Mahomes last week to a torn ACL in a loss to the Chargers that eliminated the team from playoff contention for the first time in over a decade. But just when Chiefs fans thought the tough times couldn't get much tougher, that is exactly what happened as backup quarterback Gardner Minshew left the game against the Titans due to injury.\n\nThe real kicker? Early reports indicate that Minshew also tore his ACL, becoming the second quarterback for the Chiefs to do so in two weeks – and forcing Kansas City into a position where they will have to finish their last two games without their top two quarterbacks.\n\nChiefs are concerned that QB Gardner Minshew tore his ACL, as @mattderrick also reported. There will be additional tests but Minshew could be the second Chiefs’ quarterback in two games to tear his ACL. pic.twitter.com/vDVoxOTGKb\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) December 21, 2025\n\nTo add insult to (literal) injury, the Chiefs would end up losing the game to the Titans 26-9, handing Tennessee just their third win of the season in the process. Kansas City dropped to 6-9 overall with the loss, further worsening an already disappointing season for the Chiefs which still features an upcoming game with the AFC West leader and potential top AFC playoff seed the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe Chiefs will now turn to third-string quarterback Chris Oladokun, who starred in college at South Florida, Samford, and South Dakota State before being drafted in the seventh round of the 2022 NFL Draft by the Steelers before eventually landing in Kansas City.\n\nHe entered Sunday's loss to the Chiefs following the injury to Minshew, and completed his first career pass on a touchdown to Travis Kelce. He would finish the game 11-of-16 with 111 passing yards and two carries for seven yards, but it was not enough to help the Chiefs to victory.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Touchdown Wire: Brutal QB luck continues for Chiefs with Gardner Minshew injury",

    "fullText": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Carolina Panthers rookie safety Lathan Ransom has experienced the dramatic highs and lows of playing in the NFL in his first season.\n\nOne week after a crucial penalty that led to a costly loss to the New Orleans Saints, Ransom redeemed himself on Sunday by intercepting Baker Mayfield with 42 seconds left to seal the Panthers' 23-20 win over the Buccaneers — allowing Carolina to vault into sole possession of first place in the NFC South.\n\n“I faced a lot of adversity, and I heard noise from everybody last week,” Ransom said. “... (But) that’s how you shake back.”\n\nRansom couldn't have felt much worse last week on the flight home from New Orleans after he was flagged for hitting sliding Saints quarterback Tyler Shough with 9 seconds left on a bang-bang play. Officials flagged Ransom for unnecessary roughness, and the 15-yard penalty turned a difficult 61-yard field goal attempt into a far more makable one from 46 yards.\n\nCharlie Smyth put it through the uprights to complete the Saints' 20-17 come-from-behind win.\n\nHad the Panthers defeated the Saints, they would have only needed to beat the Bucs on Sunday to clinch the NFC South and end a seven-year playoff drought. Instead, the loss left the Panthers on the outside of the playoff bubble.\n\nRansom said he was hard on himself.\n\nBut the fourth-draft pick from Ohio State decided early last week that instead of dwelling on the mistake he'd use it as motivation.\n\n“I understand that the game is not won or lost by one play, but people behind their phone are going to have their own opinions,” Ransom said. “I just heard all the noise — listened to it and used it as fuel for this game.”\n\nRansom leaned on the support last week of veteran defensive leaders such as Jaycee Horn, Derrick Brown and Mike Jackson, who shares the locker next to him.\n\nJackson and others advised to look ahead, not back and keeping playing at full speed.\n\n“He responded like a grown man should,\" Jackson said. “At the end of day, everyone was talking trash to him, like he shouldn't be in the game and this and that. And today he responded like he should be. I'll just say I'm proud of him. Because at the end of the day it's grown man football and he showed that.”\n\nPanthers coach Dave Canales greeted Ransom on the sideline with a huge hug after interception, and smiled as he spoke about the rookie after the game.\n\n“That’s a great story,” Canales said. “That’s fantastic and it’s just about belief and having confidence in our guys to be able to be studs about the things we need to work on and be studs about the different decisions that come up. I love that for Lathan — for him to be able to make the winning play, the biggest play of the game for us.”\n\nThe Panthers will need more big plays from Ransom and other young players if they hope to dethrone the Buccaneers, who have won the last four NFC South titles.\n\nCarolina can clinch the division with a win next week against Seattle and a Tampa Bay loss to Miami. But if the Bucs win, it will come down to a rematch in Week 18 for the division title.\n\n“I’ve learned a bunch throughout the season, especially from that first game,” Ransom said. “You’re going to learn. It’s a learning process. You’re playing with the best of the best. I learn more and more every game and I try to take those teachings into the next game.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

    "fullText": "Game result: The Texans beat the Raiders, 23-21, in Week 16. Houston improves to 10-5 on the year and stays at the No. 7 seed in the AFC Playoff picture. Houston remains a game behind the Jacksonville Jaguars in the AFC South, who moved to 11-4 with their win over the Denver Broncos on Week 16.\n\nThe Houston Texans are closing in on a playoff berth, but it will be at least another week before they will have a clinching scenario. The Texans host the Las Vegas Raiders in Week 16 and this is a game they absolutely cannot lose.\n\nThe Texans are 9-5 and have won six straight in a streak that has included wins over the Jaguars, Bills, Colts, and Chiefs. They beat the Cardinals 40-20 last week. The Texans face a Raiders squad that is 2-12 and has lost eight straight games. Last week, the Raiders were thumped by the Eagles 31-0 in Philly.\n\nHouston is a 14.5-point favorite, which is the biggest spread of Week 16.\n\nThe Texans are in second place in the division sitting one game back of the Jaguars. Houston and Jacksonville split their season series and the Texans have a half game lead for the divisional tiebreaker (4-1 vs. 3-1). The Jaguars are traveling to face the Broncos this weekend, so if they lose that but win their two remaining games, the tiebreaker would go to record in common games.\n\nMeanwhile, the Colts sit a game back of the Texans and still has one game left with them. Houston won the first game in Week 13. The Colts need to see the Texans lose in Week 16 or 17 to create a situation in which the Colts can finish ahead of them.\n\nThe Texans are in seventh place and hold the final wild card spot ahead of the 8-6 Colts and 7-7 Ravens. If the Texans win and the Colts lose, Houston would have a wild card clinching scenario in Week 17 when they travel to face the Chargers. The Texans enter Week 16 with a 98% chance of making the playoffs at The Athletic’s playoff simulator. Houston has a 58% chance of claiming a wild card berth and a 40% chance of winning the division.\n\nThe Raiders are a common opponent for the Texans and Jaguars. There is a very real chance the Texans and Jaguars finish tied and it common opponents. They are also a common opponent with the Chargers, but Houston and LA will have a head-to-head tiebreaker sorted out when they meet in Week 17.",

    "fullText": "GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Bijan Robinson gained 171 yards from scrimmage and had a touchdown catch, Kirk Cousins threw two TD passes and ran for a score, and the Atlanta Falcons held on to beat the Arizona Cardinals 26-19 on Sunday.\n\nThe Falcons (6-9) won for the second straight week, with both coming on the road.\n\nArizona's defense made a fourth-down stop at its own 40-yard line with 2:05 left, setting up a chance to tie the game or take the lead, but Atlanta's C.J. Henderson made a diving interception of Jacoby Brissett's pass with 1:30 remaining to seal it.\n\nRobinson had 92 yards receiving on seven catches, including a 13-yard touchdown, and added 76 yards rushing on 16 carries. The 23-year-old became the third player in franchise history to gain at least 2,000 yards from scrimmage in a season, joining Jamal Anderson (1998) and William Andrews (1981 and 1983).\n\nArizona (3-12) has lost seven straight and 12 of 13 since starting the season 2-0.\n\nThe Falcons pushed ahead 26-16 early in the fourth quarter when Cousins scored on a 1-yard run, which capped a 12-play, 66-yard drive. Arizona cut the deficit to 26-19 with 4:37 left on Chad Ryland's 34-yard field goal, taking advantage of Cousins' fumble at midfield.\n\nBrissett completed 16 of 31 passes for 203 yards with a touchdown and an interception. The veteran has a 1-9 record as the Cardinals' starter since taking over for the injured Kyler Murray in Week 6.\n\nArizona tight end Elijah Higgins had 91 yards receiving on seven catches.\n\nAtlanta rallied from an early 10-point deficit to tie the game at 16-all heading into halftime. Cousins hit Kyle Pitts for an 11-yard touchdown with 25 seconds left in the second quarter. Calais Campbell, Arizona's 39-year-old defensive end, blocked the extra-point attempt to keep the Falcons from taking the lead.\n\nArizona tried a 50-yard field goal to take the lead just before the break, but Ryland's kick was no good, bouncing off the right upright.\n\nRyland also missed a 44-yard attempt in the third quarter wide right.\n\nThe Cardinals took a 10-0 lead midway through the first quarter after Michael Wilson made a circus catch for a 32-yard touchdown. Falcons cornerback Cobee Bryant and Wilson tumbled into the end zone as they fought for possession and the ball bounced between them, eventually settling between Wilson's legs without hitting the ground.\n\nCardinals: CB Max Melton (heel), LT Paris Johnson Jr. (knee) and S Jalen Thompson (hamstring) were among six inactives. ... CB Garrett Williams (Achilles tendon) left in the first quarter and had to be carted off the field after the non-contact injury. ... Rookie DL Walter Nolen III (knee) was carted off in the third quarter. ... DL Josh Sweat (ankle) was hurt during the first quarter and initially returned, but was ruled out in the third quarter.\n\nFalcons: Host the Los Angeles Rams on Monday, Dec. 29.\n\nCardinals: At Cincinnati next Sunday.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

Oh, and the Eagles also beat the Commanders — which eliminated the Chargers’ opponent this week, the Dallas Cowboys, from playoff contention. And heading into Sunday, we could see some big shifts in the AFC playoff picture.\n\nThe Broncos entered the week with the possibility of clinching the top AFC seed on the table. They needed to beat the Jaguars, and they needed the Chargers to beat the Cowboys to make it happen. The Chargers pulled it off, but the Jaguars shocked the Broncos with a 34-20 win.\n\nBut the most important shift we could still see in Week 16 is the Chargers clinching a playoff spot. That will happen with a win over the Cowboys, a box the Chargers checked, plus either a Texans loss to the Raiders (didn’t happen, though the Raiders made it a game) or a Colts loss to the 49ers on Monday Night Football.\n\nHere’s where the Chargers stand after the late afternoon slate, and the win over the Cowboys.\n\nDenver Broncos 12-3 (clinched playoff berth)",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers have struggled from three-point range this season, shooting 34.3%, 25th in the NBA.\n\nIn a 15-point loss last night against the Clippers, the Lakers shot an abysmal 16% from three (6-for-38). With Rui Hachimura and Deandre Ayton sidelined, Jake LaRavia entered the starting lineup.\n\nAlthough the fourth-year forward posted a double-double with 12 points, 11 rebounds and six assists, he continues to struggle from beyond the arc.\n\nLaRavia shot 0-for-4 from deep in what has been an inefficient shooting season. His 30.5% from deep is a career-low, after averaging a career-high 42.3% from beyond the arc last season.\n\nFollowing the game, LaRavia spoke on his shooting struggles, expecting to get back on track soon.  “I know I’m a good shooter, everyone on the staff knows I’m a good shooter, everyone on the team knows I’m a good shooter,” LaRavia said. “At some point, I have to make shots. Obviously, been in a slump pretty much this entire season outside of that first stretch of games where I was making some. But they’ll drop.”\n\nFor Los Angeles, they'll need LaRavia to step up, especially if Luka Doncic is sidelined for an extended period. Even when Los Angeles is fully healthy, 34.3% from deep isn't a recipe for success in the modern NBA.\n\nIn addition to LaRavia, role players like Marcus Smart, Gabe Vincent and Dalton Knecht will be relied upon to knock down threes in support of Doncic, LeBron James and Austin Reaves.\n\nThe Lakers will return to action Tuesday against the Phoenix Suns.\n\nFormer NBA Champion reveals he nearly signed with the Lakers\n\nDylan Harper shares his thoughts after crushing NBA Cup defeat\n\nKnicks' Karl-Anthony Towns makes classy gesture after NBA Cup victory\n\nPat Riley nearly paired Dwayne Wade with Allen Iverson\n\nDanny Wolf's stock continues to rise\n\nMichael Porter Jr. is lighting it up in the month of December",

Jacksonville entered the week sitting at the top of the AFC South … but we did see some shakeups in the AFC playoff picture in Week 16 — and there may be more to come, including the Jaguars clinching the division.\n\nThe Broncos were also in position to clinch the AFC West with a win over the Jags, and a Chargers loss to the Cowboys, who were eliminated from NFC playoff contention with the Eagles’ win over the Commanders on Saturday and did lose to the Chargers on Sunday. Jacksonville played spoiler in an incredible road upset, blocking the Broncos’ path to the No. 1 seed in the AFC for now at least. The Broncos’ top-seed clinching scenario included the aforementioned Chargers loss that didn’t happen, plus a Patriots loss to the Ravens on Sunday Night Football (which seems possible at least) and a Bills loss to the Browns (which did not happen).\n\nThe Jaguars had two potential paths on Sunday to clinch the AFC South: A Texans loss to the Raiders (the Raiders kept it close, but ultimately added a ninth game to their losing streak) OR a Colts loss to the 49ers on Monday Night Football will solidify the Jags as the division winner. So we’ll see what happens when the Colts take on the 49ers on Monday.\n\nHere’s where things stand after the Jaguars’ massive win in Denver and the rest of the late afternoon slate of games. .\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nDenver Broncos 12-2 (clinched playoff berth)",

    "fullText": "ATLANTA (AP) — Trae Young is quickly returning to his All-Star form after missing 21 games with a knee injury.\n\nNow, the Atlanta Hawks can shift their focus to healing their ailing defense.\n\nThe Hawks ranked 22nd in scoring defense before Sunday's 152-150 loss to the Chicago Bulls in the NBA's highest-scoring game this season.\n\nThe Bulls had nine scorers in double figures, led by Matas Buzelis with 28 points. The Bulls' 152 points set a season high. They also set season highs with 41 assists, 57.6% field goal percentage and 47.6% 3-point shooting (20 of 42).\n\nYoung scored a season-high 35 points with nine assists. Jalen Johnson had 36 points with 11 rebounds and nine assists.\n\nThe Hawks also had Onyeka Okongwu score 23 points and Vit Krejci add 20. Young's encouraging showing and all the offense wasn't enough to overcome the leaky defense. The Bulls set another season high by scoring 83 points in the first half.\n\n“It’s kind of tough winning games when you give up 80 points in the first half,” Johnson said. “It’s kind of embarrassing in a sense. …. Hopefully we cut down on some of the things we’re doing.”\n\nThe Hawks (15-15) have lost three straight and seven of nine to fall back to .500.\n\nYoung started for the second time in three games after missing 21 games with a right MCL sprain.\n\n“I think everybody is excited to have Trae back,” Johnson said. “He’s been out for a while. ... The fact he’s found his rhythm already in his second game is a good sign.”\n\nCoach Quin Snyder said Young may need more time before he's ready to play back-to-back games.\n\nYoung logged 26 minutes against Chicago, which he said was his limit for his second game back.\n\n“I feel amazing,” Young said. “They did their job, put me right at 26 minutes. They weren’t allowing me to do any more. ... I feel great.”\n\nYoung led the NBA in assists last season and is a four-time All-Star. He scored only eight points in 20 minutes in his first game back, a 133-126 loss at Charlotte on Thursday night. He was back in his high-scoring form against Chicago but missed a last-second jumper that would have tied the game.\n\n“Those are shots that he makes,\" Snyder said. “You feel good about getting the ball in the right guy’s hands.”\n\nSnyder said the Hawks “had a lot of breakdowns in execution” on defense in the first half. The Bulls scored 69 points in the second half and made 54.3% of their shots from the field, but Snyder said his defense “did a better job with that in the second half as far as making them work hard.”\n\nYoung said the high-scoring pace was no surprise.\n\n“It’s how both teams play,” Young said. \"Both teams play fast. Teams are coming in here and playing fast against us. We’ve got to figure out how to stop a team that can only play fast.'\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

    "description": "Trevon Diggs has come clean about how his October concussion. He also acknowledges that he is uncertain if he'll stay on with the Cowboys in 2026.",
    "fullText": "After two months of rampant speculation and mysterious silence on the subject, Cowboys cornerback has finally given an explanation for how he got a concussion back in mid-October, an incident that kickstarted his latest string of eight missed games.\n\nHis version of events, however, may not do much to quiet the calls for Dallas to cut ties with him.\n\nThe two-time Pro Bowler himself acknowledged that Sunday's loss may have been his final game at AT&T Stadium in a Cowboys uniform.\n\nIn the days leading up to the 2025 home finale versus the Chargers, NFL insider Jane Slater reported that Diggs had shared with her how he got the concussion. She classified his explanation then as \"far less nefarious than some of the rumors\" that had been circulating online.\n\nAfter Sunday's 34-17 loss to Los Angeles, Slater shared- with Diggs's permission- that Diggs says he took a hit to the head while trying to install a TV from his ceiling. The pole mount, he said, fell on his head.\n\n\"I was trying to be a handyman,\" he reportedly told her.\n\nPer Slater, Diggs \"didn't think it was a big deal and didn't need to be addressed but speculation on the internet went way too far.\"\n\nSome of you wanted to know how Trevon Diggs got concussed. It was never that crazy but the lack of answers made it sound like it was. With his permission he shared and here’s the video of it.\n\nHe says a tv he was trying to install from the ceiling with the pole mount fell on his… pic.twitter.com/3ooFFZFWDb\n\n— Jane Slater (@SlaterNFL) December 21, 2025\n\nDiggs reportedly came to the Cowboys facility on Oct. 16 exhibiting concussion symptoms. He was declared out for the team's Week 7 contest versus Washington. The team moved him to injured reserve after that game, but reported the cause as a knee issue. He sat out longer than the mandated three games and was only elevated to the active roster this past Saturday, the final day of his evaluation window.\n\nDiggs and the Cowboys were at odds for some time over why he wasn't back in the lineup sooner. Diggs had been claiming that he was fully healthy and ready to return; owner Jerry Jones disputed that, based on what he had exhibited in practice. Head coach Brian Schottenheimer alluded to consistency issues that had more to do with Diggs's all-around behavior.\n\nNow pressed into service for the final three games due in large part to DaRon Bland's move to injured reserve, Diggs is faced with the possibility of being irreparably on the outs with the team that gave him a $97 million contract just two years ago.\n\n\"Yeah, possibly,\" he told reporters after the loss Sunday. \"If this is my last [home] game with the Cowboys, it's tough.\"\n\nDiggs got the start on Sunday in place of Bland. And while he was in on six tackles on the day, he was also notably the closest defender on a 25-yard second-quarter touchdown throw to Ladd McConkey and was repeatedly targeted by Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert, who threw for 300 yards and two touchdowns and finished with a spectacular passer rating of 132.8.\n\nDespite the rollercoaster of drama that has marked his difficult 2025 season, Diggs has said he wants to return to Dallas next year.\n\n\"After the season, I guess we'll figure it out.\"\n\nTodd is on X at @ToddBrock24f7.

    "fullText": "Despite a sloppy start, UConn men’s basketball moved to 2-0 in the Big East with a convincing road win over DePaul in Chicago. While the Huskies (12-1, 2-0 Big East) looked out of sorts in the first half without star guard Solo Ball, they snapped out of it just in time to cruise to a comfortable 72-54 win.\n\nBall was surprisingly listed as inactive, ruled out with a wrist injury suffered after a hard fall in the conference opener against Butler on Tuesday. With Ball out, Jaylin Stewart returned to the starting lineup.\n\nThe Huskies were entirely out of sorts early on, turning it over six times in the first eight minutes alone, leading to 12 DePaul points.\n\nThe home team led for most of the start of the first half, up by as much as eight with 10:54 to play after Layden Blocker capped off a 7-0 run with a layup to lead 15-7. But Silas Demary Jr. and Alex Karaban did everything in their power to keep things from getting too out of hand. Demary Jr. helped UConn punch back, scoring five-straight points as part of a 9-0 run to give the Huskies their first lead of the night.\n\nUConn would take the lead for good off a nifty reverse layup from Jaylin Stewart with 6:17 left to play, and Karaban and Demary helped stretch the lead to as much as five in the first half, combining for a 5-0 run in the final minutes before a Blocker buzzer beater cut the halftime lead to three.\n\nKaraban was a much-needed stabilizing force throughout the entire first 20 minutes, scoring 10 points on a perfect 6-6 shooting from the field. He scored five of UConn’s first seven points as the offense sputtered out of the gate, and stretched the floor effectively with two 3-pointers. Demary Jr. started out on pace for a shot at another triple-double with seven points, five assists, and six boards in just the first half alone.\n\nDespite only really being able to lean on those two and coughing up the ball 13 times for 16 Blue Demons points, UConn managed to lead 33-30 at the break after arguably its worst half of the season.\n\nThe Huskies looked revitalized after halftime and came out hot, scoring four quick points to go up seven. With the offense back on track, UConn rattled off a 12-2 run capped off with a Braylon Mulins jumper to lead 52-36 with 11:53 to play. The Huskies’ defense tightened the clamps on the Blue Demons in the second half, with DePaul scoring just eight points in the first 10 minutes of the final period.\n\nWith the defense humming and the offense back on track, UConn stretched the lead to as much as 17 after a putback from Tarris Reed Jr. made it 58-41 with just under eight minutes to play. The Blue Demons did make one last attempt to get back in it by cutting the lead to 10 with four minutes to play, but a Reed fadeaway jumper off the glass extended the lead back to 12.\n\nOn the next possession, Karaban walled up and altered a DePaul shot on the block, then found Mullins for a three on the next possession to put the game away for good. Mullins would hit one more three-pointer the next time down for the cherry on top and finished the night with eight points.\n\nKaraban led all scorers with 21 points, and added six rebounds, two assists, and a block. Reed Jr. posted his second double-double of the season with 14 points and 11 boards, and added four assists and three blocks. Demary Jr., who appeared to be under the weather, flirted with a triple-double and finished with 14 points, seven assists, eight rebounds, two blocks, and a steal.\n\nUConn now embarks on a 10-day break for the holidays, with the Huskies returning to action on New Year’s Eve with a road game against Xavier. Tip-off against the Musketeers is set for 5:00 p.m. ET, with the game set to be broadcast on NBC Sports and available to stream on Peacock.",

My hat goes off for the guys that put together all these years. “ That’s part of it,” said Reid. “We can learn from it, and we need to do that going forward.” Sometimes a good kick in the tail helps you there. Coaches and players.”\n\nAfter only one catch for six receiving yards in Week 16, tight end Travis Kelce recorded his 12th consecutive season with 800 receiving yards, tying Pro Football Hall of Fame wide receiver Jerry Rice for first all-time.

    "description": "The Arizona Cardinals lost for the 12th time this season, falling by a score of 26-19 to the Atlanta Falcons in front of a thin home crowd at State Farm...",
    "fullText": "The Arizona Cardinals lost for the 12th time this season, falling by a score of 26-19 to the Atlanta Falcons in front of a thin home crowd at State Farm Stadium. Arizona’s overall effort was a mixed bag, but injuries truly began to pile up as a brutal season continued trending in a dismal direction. With two games remaining (one against a Los Angeles Rams team desperate to win the division), there’s little hope to see another game in the win column this season.\n\nArizona did finally play a close game for the first time in multiple weeks. Although it did come down to the final drive, it was another game that felt ugly, disjointed and tough to watch. While injuries have been pointed to as a culprit of this particularly poor season, Sunday’s bout of maladies may carry impact into 2026.\n\nThe Cardinals’ offense was able to run the ball better than most efforts this season. For what felt like the first time in many weeks, Arizona put up 100-plus yards on the ground. A combination of Michael Carter, Corey Kiner and Emari Demercado were finally able to find some running room, combining for 127 yards on 22 carries — a rate of just over 5.7 yards per carry.\n\nUnfortunately, the passing attack that has been quite lethal in terms of overall volume production was nearly silent. QB Jacoby Brissett struggled, managing to complete just 16 of his 31 passes for 203 yards and one score. There were some key drops, but Brissett’s accuracy felt erratic.\n\nTE trey McBride was held to just 27 yards on four receptions, and the Cardinals’ leading receiver was backup TE Elijah Higgins.\n\nDefensively, Arizona managed two turnovers. Their defensive front was able to get pressure on an immobile Kirk Cousins. DL Darius Robinson had an excellent game with seven tackles, a TFL, a pass defended and a fumble recovery. CB Will Johnson locked up Falcons WR Drake London one-on-one. In some ways, it might have been considered a mild bounce-back performance — if not for the fact that star RB Bijan Robinson collected 168 total yards and a touchdown.\n\nIt was the type of effort one can expect from a team that has now lost seven straight. While the final score was ultimately close, it never felt that the Cardinals — after holding a 16-10 lead late in the first half — had a chance to put together enough offense to stay ahead of Atlanta.\n\nBut the most brutal reality of Sunday’s game is a tough one to accept. In a game that meant nothing in terms of standings or the playoff picture, Arizona lost multiple high-level contributors to injury.\n\nOLB Josh Sweat was helped off the field with an ankle injury. C Hjalte Froholdt suffered an elbow injury. Even the ironclad Budda Baker had to exit the game for a concussion evaluation, though he did eventually return.\n\nBut two of the Cardinals’ biggest defensive contributors suffered more concerning injuries. CB Garrett Williams left the game after a non-contact incident, and was quickly ruled out with an achilles injury — words that ring ominous to his availability next season. And DL Walter Nolen III, who had not struggled with injuries in his football career prior to 2025, left on the cart, visibly emotional with a knee injury.\n\nIt’s one thing to lose games. In fact, many would likely prefer to see the Cardinals’ draft stock increase. But to watch some of the more promising players on this defense leave with injuries of the non-contact variety is, somehow, the only way to make this brutal season a worse experience for loyal Cardinals fans.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Denver Broncos had not lost a game since September 21. That changed on Sunday, when the Jacksonville Jaguars strolled into Empower Field and handed them a 34-20 defeat.\n\nThe loss tightens things up on the AFC playoff race as the Broncos are now just one game ahead of the Los Angeles Chargers in the AFC West and could be tied with the New England Patriots for the No. 1 overall seed, depending on what happens in New England's Sunday night tilt with the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nThe story of this game was much more about what Jacksonville did right than what Denver did wrong. The Jags were efficient on offense, moving the ball well against Denver's vaunted defense and cashing in against the league's best red-zone defense.\n\nTrevor Lawrence, coming off the best game of his career last week, had another gem on Sunday, completing 23 of 36 passes for 279 yards with three touchdowns. Parker Washington had 145 yards receiving on six catches, forcing several missed tackles throughout the contest.\n\nThe Broncos had their chances to respond to the big shots being delivered by the Jaguars, but two second-half turnovers by Bo Nix knocked the Broncos out.\n\nThe Jaguars continued their historically good play in the Mile High City and now have a winning record of 5-4 all-time there.

    "fullText": "The San Francisco 49ers are heading back to the postseason despite not suiting up yet in Week 16.\n\nTo clinch a playoff spot the 49ers needed the Pittsburgh Steelers to beat the Detroit Lions at Ford Field on Sunday. The seven-point underdog Steelers did San Francisco a favor by upsetting the Lions 29-24 while the 49ers sat in Indianapolis awaiting their Monday night showdown with the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nThe 49ers clinched thanks to the NFL's tiebreaking procedures.\n\nSan Francisco's maximum losses is seven, and Detroit on Sunday suffered their seventh defeat. The Lions are the only other team in the NFC that can reach 10 wins. At worst the 49ers could finished tied with the Lions at 10-7.\n\nSince they didn't play head-to-head this season, the tiebreaking procedure moves to best record in conference games. The Lions are 5-5 within the NFC while the 49ers are sitting at 8-2. With only two games left against NFC opponents, the 49ers have clinched a better conference record than Detroit.\n\nClinching a playoff spot doesn't mean the 49ers will be in cruise control the rest of the way, however. They can still earn the NFC's No. 1 seed and a first-round bye if they win their final three games against the Colts, Chicago Bears and Seattle Seahawks.\n\nA win over the Colts will clinch a top-six seed for the 49ers since the Green Bay Packers fell to the Chicago Bears on Saturday and dropped to 9-6-1, meaning their maximum number of wins would be 10, and one shy of the 11 the 49ers would reach with a win Monday night.\n\nThe 49ers and Colts are slated to kick off at 5:15pm Pacific Time on Monday.\n\nMore 49ers: Kyle Shanahan blames 49ers WR for not reaching $500,000 incentive yet\n\nThis article originally appeared on Niners Wire: San Francisco 49ers clinch playoff spot after Steelers upset Lions",

    "fullText": "The Detroit Lions' 2025 NFL playoff hopes were just crushed.\n\nNeeding a victory to virtually keep their postseason hopes alive, the Lions came up short at Ford Field on Sunday, Dec. 21, against the Pittsburgh Steelers, losing the Week 16 game, 29-24.\n\nThe Lions will be eliminated if the Packers win either of their final two games against the Baltimore Ravens or Minnesota Vikings.\n\nIt was an ugly and uninspired performance, especially with the season on the line, despite a late comeback effort.\n\nBIG STORY: Lions fan says DK Metcalf swung at him after he used star's full name\n\nThe Lions took a 10-3 lead on an impressive 20-yard touchdown catch from rookie Isaac TeSlaa with 1:55 left in the first half, but it was all down hill from there. The Steelers went 80 yards and scored on a miracle TD with two seconds left before the break when running back Kenneth Gainwell made an impressive catch through contact, fell down but wasn't touched by linebacker Alex Anzalone and ran into the end zone to tie the game.\n\nThe momentum carried into the third quarter. The Lions ran just three plays in the period, tied for the fewest in a quarter for any team this season, according to the CBS broadcast, and one of those plays was a safety when Goff took a sack in the end zone.\n\nThe Lions were dominated in nearly every facet, particularly in the second half, but the real difference was on the ground. The Steelers rushed for 230 yards and broke two 45-yard TD runs in the fourth quarter, while the Lions rushed for just 15 yards.\n\nOutside of the massive playoff implications, one of the biggest stories of the day took place in the stands. Steelers star wide receiver DK Metcalf got into an altercation with a Lions fan who was leaning over the ledge to talk with him and Metcalf took a swing at him.\n\nMetcalf was not ejected from the game as officials did not see the play and thus couldn't throw a flag, meaning he couldn't be thrown out.\n\n“There was no flag on the field, so New York cannot weigh in with regard to a potential disqualification,” the NFL said in a statement.\n\nMetcalf had a quiet day, finishing with four catches for just 42 yards.\n\nDave Birkett covers the Lions for the Detroit Free Press.

    "description": "To prevent ramming attacks at Christmas markets, German officials have installed concrete blocks, chain barriers and, in one case, metal bollards removed by a hand-cranked crane.",
    "fullText": "Reporting from the Christmas market in Augsburg, Germany.\n\nFor as long as anyone can remember, the highlight of the annual Christmas market in Augsburg, a wealthy 2,000-year-old city in southern Germany, was the magnificent Christmas tree at the market’s center.\n\nThis year, the most popular attractions are the removable security bollards at the market’s edge, newly installed to prevent cars ramming into the holiday crowds.\n\nOn a recent December afternoon, half a dozen captivated bystanders stood around three of these mundane-looking posts. Wielding their cellphones, most of them were filming municipal employees as they used a hand-cranked crane to remove the 770-pound bollards every time a tram needed to pass through. During rush hour, that involved removing the bollards roughly once a minute.\n\n“These things are terrible,” said Hannelore Hendrick, 67, a rare bystander who did not take out her phone. “They remind me of the dangers of being here.”\n\nFor centuries, Christmas markets have appeared in town squares across Germany during Advent, bringing a sense of community, tradition and seasonal cheer to the darkest days of the central European year. Augsburg’s Christmas market has been held in the city for more than half a millennium, with the only documented breaks occurring during World War II and the coronavirus pandemic. Revelers can buy mulled wine, steak buns and Christmas decorations from brightly decorated wooden kiosks.\n\nThis year, the carefree spirit of the country’s roughly 3,200 Christmas markets has been somewhat dimmed. Security at these markets has been a national concern since 2016, when a man steered a stolen truck into crowds in Berlin. Ever since, municipal officials across Germany have tried to prevent further attacks by encircling markets with barriers.\n\nNow, officials are taking things a step further after another attack last December in Magdeburg, eastern Germany, which highlighted a flaw in the existing security measures. A man plowed a rented S.U.V. into the crowds there, killing six and injuring hundreds, after squeezing the car through a narrow gap in the barriers that had been left open for emergency vehicles. To fix that problem 12 months later, the authorities in various cities have blocked such gaps with police vans, metal gates and concrete blocks.\n\nAugsburg, where trams run through the protected zone, is unique in installing bollards that need to be moved hundreds of times a day. The contraption is so unwieldy that it has become a national symbol of the new security environment, attracting attention across Germany.\n\nThe mechanism first became famous through social media in late November, prompting coverage from the national news networks. Eventually, a well-known televised comedy show made a segment about it, leading to the charge that the city might be overdoing it, or doing it wrong.\n\nAugsburg’s mayor, Eva Weber, insists that securing the market is worth a few late-night quips.\n\n“It’s better for people to laugh at Augsburg than for people to cry with Augsburg,” she said in an interview.\n\nOn a recent visit, I found the security crews hard at work, at one point moving the crane roughly once a minute, attaching the bollard to a hook, whirling the crane’s handles to lift the bollard, and then pushing the whole contraption out of the way of waiting trams.\n\nOnce each tram passed, the workers reversed the whole procedure — to the amusement of a small crowd of onlookers.\n\n“At least they don’t need to go the gym,” said Elke Noll, 58, smiling at the physical effort required to make it work.\n\nComic though the system was, no one I met was opposed to its installation. Reinhold Hohenögger, 59, who has sold metal signs at the market for a decade, said that many of his friends no longer come there for fear of attacks. Lena Beuerle, 23, who was drinking mulled wine with her friends, said that while they can still get into the Christmas spirit, they have become more vigilant as they move through the market.\n\nA national poll last month found that 62 percent of respondents were at least somewhat worried about attacks on Christmas markets; only 35 percent said they weren’t worried at all.\n\nThe city is spending roughly 50,000 euros, or $58,000, to secure the Christmas market, according to Ms. Weber, the mayor. That cost includes the wages of a six-person crew that staffs two sets of bollards and cranes for more than 60 hours a week. And it is a small fraction of the estimated million euros that the little market earns each year, she said.\n\n“It would be reckless not to consider how large events can be protected,” said Ms. Weber.\n\nThough the barriers have their critics, some vendors at the market think the eccentric system has helped to attract more visitors to the market. “We are definitely getting more people than last year — and it’s not just Germans but people coming from abroad too,” said Sina Hefele, 21, who sells Christmas-tree-shaped ornaments at a booth a few yards away from the bollards.\n\n“If you want people to come,” said Mr. Hohenögger, the seller of metal signs, “you have to show them that you have thought about security measures.”",

    "fullText": "400-Mile-Long Fog Blankets California For Weeks\n\nPretty much everyone feels like they see endless gray skies in winter, but California’s Central Valley is taking things a step further with three weeks of foggy conditions from a phenomenon called \"tule fog.\"\n\nSatellite imagery from NASA and CIRA has revealed how pervasive the fog has been for the region, with day-after-day and week-after-week fogginess never letting up.\n\nThe fog started to develop on Nov. 22 and was firmly in place by Nov. 24 — and it's pretty much been there ever since (though it has grown and shrunk a little on a day-to-day basis).\n\nSoil in the Central Valley has been nice and moist following a rainy autumn.\n\nIn fact, precipitation totals from September through November ranked among the top 10% wettest on record for most of central and southern California. Modesto and Hanford, California, each broke the record for the wettest meteorological fall since records began.\n\nSo we have moist air for the equation.\n\nIn late November, a stable high-pressure system developed over California, helping to trap all of that moisture.\n\nThe fog layer has kept things cool in the valley as the rest of the Southwest has been basking in above-average temperatures.\n\nNow we have our temperature inversion.\n\nIs the end coming soon? Until a storm comes in to clear out the moist air, there's no anticipated end to the foggy conditions. The National Weather Service in Hanford, California, is warning of fog at least through Friday of this week.\n\nSara Tonks is a content meteorologist with weather.com and has a bachelor’s and a master’s degree from Georgia Tech in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences along with a master’s degree from Unity Environmental University in Marine Science.",

    "fullText": "With street lights out and wireless data limited, the Waymo vehicles were causing backups across the city.\n\nWith street lights out and wireless data limited, the Waymo vehicles were causing backups across the city.\n\nA power outage struck San Francisco on Saturday that blacked out about 130,000 customers at its peak, according to Pacific Gas and Electric Company, but also caused another problem: stranded Waymo vehicles. Posts all over social media showed the company’s autonomous SUVs sitting still in the streets and causing traffic jams.\n\nSome people posted videos of Teslas using their FSD feature to navigate the same streets, and Elon Musk tweeted that “Tesla Robotaxis were unaffected by the SF power outage.”\n\nIn response to an inquiry from The Verge, Waymo spokesperson Suzanne Philion sent a statement saying, “We have temporarily suspended our ride-hailing services given the broad power outage in San Francisco. We are focused on keeping our riders safe and ensuring emergency personnel have the clear access they need to do their work.” PG&E reported as of 7AM PT that “Crews have restored about 110,000 customers and PG&E continues to work on restoring the remaining 21,000 customers, primarily in the Presidio, Richmond District, Golden Gate Park and small areas of downtown San Francisco,” as it continued repairs after a fire at a five-story power substation.\n\nExactly why the cars weren’t moving remains unclear, with no public updates we could find on the company’s social media channels, but speculation centered on spotty wireless data connections, with cell towers either down or overloaded by people who no longer had access to Wi-Fi, and/or the street lights that weren’t operating without power.\n\nThese problems have occurred before, though, as seen in TikTok videos from earlier this year showing Waymos frozen by a malfunctioning street light and during a power outage in Austin, Texas. In a reply to a Reddit post showing another similar situation last year, someone saying they were a former employee commented explaining that the vehicle would send a request to a remote assistant and wait for their response before proceeding.\n\nAccording to a company blog post, it reaches out to a human response agent when the car encounters “unique interactions,” providing them with live and recorded views from its cameras in addition to a 3D map of what the sensors are picking up. However, those may require bandwidth that’s hard to find during a significant power outage. I couldn’t find any statistics on how many remote assistance operators Waymo has available at a given time, but in November, the company announced it passed a third-party audit by Tüv Süd, a German tech inspection company that evaluated its remote assistance program against industry best practices.",

    "description": "From Denny's breakfasts to hotel gift exchanges, we turned my pilot husband's flight schedule into creative, meaningful holiday memories.",
    "fullText": "There is so much pressure on women to make the holidays perfect for everyone. I had to accept the fact that I was unable to provide the consistent traditions that I enjoyed as a child. Instead, I learned to create memories while my pilot husband flew during the holidays.\n\nWith my husband's flight schedule, holidays never looked traditional or perfectly planned. There were tears, and some years were harder than others. As hard as some of those years were, they became the memories we still talk about and cherish today.\n\nI grew up with consistent holiday traditions. My grandparents visited on Christmas Eve. We ate together, opened gifts, and my great-grandmother played the piano. I would struggle to sleep, but I would wake up to gifts with my parents and my brother. After the chaos of gift opening, we would take a drive to see my other grandparents and eat, and then open presents. Like clockwork, I knew what to expect every year.\n\nI knew my husband would work holidays when we married. Living with that reality was more difficult than I expected. I missed the comfort of my childhood traditions. I felt sad that my kids wouldn't share those same experiences. My dream of creating consistent family traditions was not going to happen. I could fight it and cry, or I could find ways to make the holidays fun and meaningful, no matter the date on the calendar.\n\nOne Christmas, while he was flying, the kids and I spent Christmas morning at a Denny's coloring. We colored pages for my grandmother, who was living in an assisted living facility. We packed our artwork and picked up some holiday treats from home. Then, we drove over for a surprise visit on Christmas morning. We had already opened gifts with her, but this was a special visit. My grandfather had passed, and she was alone. Her memory was fading, and she spent a lot of time in her little apartment. Her face lit up when we walked into the room. We spent the morning looking through old photos. She hung up the pictures the kids had brought over, and we walked around the facility saying hi to the residents. Spending Christmas morning with her is a memory that I'll cherish forever.\n\nThat Christmas morning at Denny's, I saw it for the first time. This wasn't about loss or compromise. Every year, my kids experienced something new and special. This was different from my traditional upbringing. That one Christmas morning with my grandmother, I saw the opportunity. The opportunity to provide my kids with something different and unique every year.\n\nThe following year, his schedule was even worse. He was flying over Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and even a few days after Christmas. That year was tough to prepare for. We decided to celebrate Christmas on the 28th. This was tough. Kids count down to a specific date all year, only to hear that they have to wait even longer. By a stroke of luck, he had a schedule change and was able to drive home, and we woke the kids up at midnight. We opened gifts, laughed, ate treats, and went back to bed. The next morning, he drove back to the airport for his Christmas Day flight.\n\nAs the kids got older, we would anxiously wait for his schedule so that we could plan our Christmas. One year, we took a last-minute cruise, came home to open gifts, and then saw him off for his Christmas Day flights.\n\nOne year, his overnight was close enough that we were able to load up some presents and drive to his hotel. We spent the day as a family. We saw a movie, ate at a restaurant, opened presents, and then the kids and I drove home.\n\nThis holiday season will be the last with my husband flying, as he retires next year. Even though he will now be home, we will always have a unique way of celebrating.",

    "fullText": "Costco endlessly mixes up its merchandise mix, offering everything from big-name retailers to its well-regarded Kirkland Signature house brand.\n\nPart of the joy of the brand is its treasure hunt model, where members never know exactly what to expect. I might visit my local warehouse needing toothbrushes, some coffee, and maybe dress socks, then leave with a canoe or a giant teddy bear.\n\nCostco Founder Jim Sinegal explained the magic of the chain's model.\n\n\"We have created a Treasure Hunt atmosphere. When customers come in, they may find at one time we have a Coach handbag, and they come back, and we don’t have the Coach handbag, but perhaps we have some Levi’s we are selling at a hot price,\" he told Masters Invest.\n\nIt's all about making members feel the need to not miss out.\n\n\"We try to create a sense of urgency, that if you see the product, you’d better buy it because chances are it won’t be there next time. We purposely run out of merchandise to create that sense of urgency in our customers,” he added.\n\nNow, current Costco CEO Ron Vachris has shared some new big-name retail partnerships that the warehouse club will use to drive sales.\n\nThe treasure hunt model powers the Costco brand.\n\n\"Costco’s 'treasure hunt' shopping experience has become one of the most iconic and influential pieces of modern retail psychology. Customers walk through the warehouse expecting not only value but surprise. This element of discovery — the possibility of finding an unexpected deal, an unusually high-quality brand, or a limited-time item — is a cornerstone of Costco’s business strategy,\" shared Mojo Sales and Strategy.\n\nThe warehouse club, way back in Sinegal's days, knew how to drive human behaviour.\n\n\"It is not accidental. It is engineered psychology, and when understood correctly, it becomes a powerful tool for vendors who want to thrive inside Costco’s ecosystem,\" Mojo Sales and Strategy added.\n\nThe treasure-hunt concept is built on the behavioral principle that people are motivated by variability.\n\nCostco sees major shift in member behavior\n\nRetail chain shuts all locations as legal changes hit industry\n\nLululemon struggles to reverse concerning customer behavior\n\nT-Mobile launches free offer for customers after major loss\n\nCostco has continued to add to that variability by surprising members by adding new items from big brands.\n\n\"We added a number of new national brand partnerships across a range of non-food categories in Q1, including Gap and Ulta gift cards, Vera Bradley apparel, and Upper Deck trading cards,\" shared CFO Gary Millerchip during the chain's first-quarter earnings call.",

    "description": "Karen Gilchrist jokes that her \"maternal instincts kicked in late,\" but by 2024 she and her husband, Pablo Slough, decided to prioritize family over climbing the corporate ladder.",
    "fullText": "Over two decades of working in demanding roles managing teams around the world had taken a toll.\n\n\"I worked straight out of college, and then it was one job to the other job,\" Slough, 53, told Business Insider. \"It was always fast-paced, high stress.\"\n\nFor Gilchrist, turning 50 last summer drove her to reflect about how she'd spent her time and what she wanted to do moving forward.\n\n\"I joke sometimes that my maternal instincts kicked in late,\" Gilchrist told Business Insider. \"But it felt like the right moment to dedicate more time to my family than to work and climbing the corporate ladder.\"\n\nTheir oldest son, Luka, 18, is in his senior year and plans to head off to college in the fall. The other two, Mateo, 15, and Joaquin, 12, aren't far behind.\n\nTaking a gap year would give the couple a chance to step away from work, travel with their kids, and figure out their next steps.\n\nBut they didn't jump in immediately. The couple, based in Boulder, Colorado, hired a financial advisor a year in advance to make sure the plan was financially feasible.\n\n\"We also decided that we're going to rent our house out while we're traveling, so we could get some income,\" Slough said.\n\nAs their plans to quit became more concrete, the couple talked through everything with their kids. Funnily enough, it was their sons who seemed unsure at first.\n\n\"We were a bit surprised that our parents would actually do it because they have always been very focused on their careers,\" their second son, Mateo, told Business Insider.\n\nBut one of the reasons the couple wanted to do this was to show their kids that life isn't just about work, Gilchrist said.\n\n\"It's about life. It's about balancing things. It's about family,\" she said, adding that they hoped the experience would show their kids that life doesn't always have to follow a fixed path.\n\nThe couple considered it a career break, but the plan was not to travel the whole time.\n\n\"We didn't want to disrupt school,\" Slough said. \"So we just thought we'll come back for school, and then whatever free time we have, we'll travel.\"\n\nThe family spent the summer of 2024 traveling around Europe, a trip planned around their eldest son's three-week business course at a university in Barcelona.\n\nTheir travels began in Turkey, before they hopped on a cruise through Greece, Croatia, Malta, and Montenegro. After dropping their son off for his program, they explored Spain and Portugal before reuniting and heading to Colombia. They were back in Colorado a week before school started.\n\nThis year, their summer took them to Asia, with stops in Hong Kong, several cities in Thailand, Vietnam, China, and finally Japan.\n\n\"We all wanted to go to Asia, so we were really excited about it,\" Luka, their oldest son, told Business Insider.\n\nTo budget for their trips, the couple created an Excel sheet to track their daily expenses.\n\n\"We had an average spend per day that we wanted to aim for. It meant that in some places, we splurged because we wanted a really nice hotel. And in other places, we were a little bit more frugal,\" Gilchrist said, adding that they would update their expenses in real time to see if they were within their budget.\n\nLooking back on the trips, the family says they loved every moment.\n\n\"It felt like our parents were more present and flexible with us,\" Joaquin, their youngest, told Business Insider. \"We also learned more about each other's preferences, from the experiences and foods we enjoy to how each of us likes to spend our free time.\"\n\nDuring the months they weren't traveling, the couple spent their time at home doing things they rarely had time for before, such as exercising together, reading, and going to the movies every week.\n\n\"Now, we have this objective of cooking something completely new every day,\" Gilchrist said.\n\nThe couple says they feel less stressed, sleep better, and have genuinely enjoyed spending more time together.\n\n\"We're like, 'OK, we're going to be together all day long. What is that going to look like?' And truthfully, I think it's been amazing,\" Gilchrist said.\n\nBut the biggest benefit of taking time away from work has been having the space to reflect on what they wanted to do next, Slough said. He started teaching three days a week at a local university.\n\n\"It's something I've always wanted to do,\" Slough said. \"And then it just happened to come my way.\"\n\nHad he been working full-time, taking up this offer would have been out of the question, he said.\n\nThey also realized they didn't have to return to their corporate jobs to live comfortably. They could earn a portion of what they once made and still maintain their lifestyle.\n\nWorking with a financial advisor helped them identify areas where they were overspending and set a goal to cut their regular expenses by 30%. Before that, the couple had never closely tracked their finances.\n\n\"We were spending so much that we thought we needed really high-paying jobs to be able to continue,\" Slough said.\n\nKyle D. Dennehy, a financial advisor at California Financial Advisor who wasn't involved in the couple's planning, told Business Insider that the first step in preparing for a career break is to create a detailed budget that outlines all income sources, expenses, and savings goals.\n\n\"Once you have your 'normal' budget, estimate how each specific category will shift during an adult gap year, but keep your long-term goal savings like retirement contributions included in the gap year budget,\" Dennehy said.\n\nOnce the difference between the regular and new budgets is clear, a plan can be created to regularly contribute toward the updated savings goal, Dennehy said.\n\nNow, the couple is exploring whether to buy and run a small local business rather than slip back into corporate jobs. Gilchrist said they might never have considered entrepreneurship without the break.\n\n\"We joke, and we say that this time has also been a research and development phase for us on, 'OK, what does being productive over the next 10, 20 years look like?'\" Gilchrist said.\n\nOf course, there are risks that come with taking an extended career break, but careful financial planning has helped them manage those uncertainties.\n\n\"Plan it properly. It can't just be like, 'Oh, I quit my job this weekend, and we're going to travel for a year.' It will not work,\" Slough said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about taking a career break?

    "description": "As iRobot's founder Colin Angle looks back on its path to bankruptcy, he says it was hard to overcome competitors in China.",
    "fullText": "If there's one lesson iRobot founder Colin Angle took from the company's bankruptcy, it's never to underestimate competitors.\n\nOn December 14, iRobot, maker of the popular robotic vacuum Roomba, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and will be acquired by its primary contract manufacturer, Chinese company Picea Robotics.\n\nAngle said one of his biggest takeaways as iRobot enters its next phase is that even market leaders must remain alert to competition from China.\n\n\"It's certainly the advent of this new type of competitor, the Chinese fast follower, who had access to the Chinese marketplace, which iRobot effectively did not,\" he said on the tech podcast \"Hard Fork\" on Friday.\n\niRobot was founded in 1990 by Angle, Helen Greiner, and Rodney Brooks — roboticists at MIT — who had a \"vision of making practical robots a reality,\" the company says on its website. It released its popular robot vacuum, Roomba, in 2002, which effectively created the category of consumer robotics.\n\nFor the next two decades, Angle said that the company grew the category and, for a brief period, was the leading manufacturer of vacuuming robots in China. The company reached its peak revenue in 2021, at $1.56 billion.\n\nIn the years that followed, however, Angle said the home robotics market was upended by new entrants from China, such as Roborock, which had been chipping away at iRobot's dominance since its arrival in 2018. Other Chinese competitors include Dreame, Ecovacs, and Shar.\n\nAngle said that companies like Roborock had an advantage against iRobot because they had a \"protected market to cut your teeth on for the competition.\"\n\nChina made several moves to ensure that Chinese manufacturers in the category had an advantage by providing direct subsidies to iRobot's competitors, Angle said.\n\nOver the past few years, China has made significant strides toward becoming a global hub for robotics innovation and adoption, rolling out multiple strategic plans across several sectors. As part of those efforts, the government has subsidized robot purchases at an average rate of about 17.5% of equipment costs, according to the Asian Robotics Review.\n\nIn some cases, iRobot's features simply lagged behind its competitors.\n\n\"Honestly, we got wet mopping wrong,\" he said. Scuba, iRobot's mopping robot, never took off as an independent product.\n\n\"It certainly got hard, and it got increasingly competitive,\" Angle said. \"Ultimately, we were open to other strategies to enable us to continue to innovate.\"\n\nOne of those was striking a deal with Amazon, which attempted to acquire the company for $1.4 billion, but the deal was terminated following an antitrust review by the Federal Trade Commission and European regulators.\n\n\"The Commission's probe focused on Amazon's ability and incentive to favor its own products and disfavor rivals, and associated effects on innovation, entry barriers, and consumer privacy,\" the FTC said in a statement in 2024. \"The Commission's investigation revealed significant concerns about the transaction's potential competitive effects.\"\n\nAngle said the deal should have been a \"no-brainer\" in a recent interview with TechCrunch.\n\n\"What happened was that iRobot and Amazon came together for the expressed purpose of creating more innovation, more consumer choice, at a time when iRobot's trajectory was honestly different from where it was several years earlier,\" he told TechCrunch.\n\nHe said the FTC and the European Commission's investigation should not have gone longer than three or four weeks.\n\n\"What happened instead was a year and a half of pendency, which had a very challenging impact on the ability to operate a company and ultimately having the acquisition blocked,\" he said.\n\nHe said iRobot should serve as a cautionary tale for the future of US manufacturing.\n\n\"The net result, which, I have argued, was done with eyes wide open, was putting the consumer robot industry in a box, gift-wrapping it, and handing it to someone else,\" he told \"Hard Fork.\"",

    "description": "Lee Wan Yu, a former Disneyland parade dancer, shares a behind-the-scenes look at the audition process and what she learned from Disney's magic.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Lee Wan Yu, 30, a Hong Kong Disneyland parade dancer turned freelance dance artist, teacher, and choreographer. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI started dancing when I was three years old, after asking my mom for ballet lessons as we walked past a studio.\n\nFrom then on, all I wanted to do was dance. That love eventually led me somewhere I, as an introvert, never expected: Hong Kong Disneyland.\n\nIt started in 2017, when Hong Kong Disneyland held an audition at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts in Singapore, where I was studying for my diploma in dance.\n\nI went with a friend who didn't want to go alone. I had no expectations and just wanted to see how a professional audition works.\n\nAbout 50 dancers from the region participated in the audition.\n\nThey gave us a short jazz combination and had us perform it in small groups, cutting dancers until about 20 of us were left. They took our photos, measured our height, and recorded our body measurements.\n\nMonths later, while I was studying for my fine arts degree in New York, I was offered a standard one-year contract as a parade dancer at Hong Kong Disneyland.\n\nWhen I arrived in May 2018, I realized I was the only Singaporean parade dancer at the time. The team included dancers from Hong Kong, Japan, the Philippines, Russia, Taiwan, and Thailand.\n\nA typical day started around 11 a.m. We had a warm-up class, followed by makeup and costumes.\n\nWe typically performed two parades a day, one in the afternoon and one at night, for about 30 minutes each. During festive seasons like Christmas, we could have up to four parades a day.\n\nIn the middle of each parade, we would stop in front of the castle for a short \"show stop\" to interact with guests.\n\nRehearsals for the Halloween parades sometimes ended around 2 a.m. because they took place after the park closed for the night.\n\nThe Hong Kong heat can be terrible, and the night-parade costumes had lights wired through and batteries attached. You could feel the weight pressing on your shoulders.\n\nSometimes I felt homesick or lonely, but once you're in costume, you have to bring your full energy.\n\nWhen you step into Disneyland, you should feel like you're transported to a different world — a place where you can disconnect, forget your problems for a while, and just be happy.\n\nThis is why guests would never see dancers working out during breaks, because Disney wanted to keep the illusion. We were also not allowed to take any backstage photos or videos.\n\nThe magic is the reason some guests come to every parade. There were adults who followed the route, taking photos, and kids who waved at us every day. I remember a teenage boy who came almost every weekend, dancing beside the route the whole time.\n\nSome of them recognized us outside the park without our costumes. Others gave us prints of photos they had taken of us.\n\nIt was more than just branding and the experience.\n\nAt Hong Kong Disneyland, everyone, from the dancers to the sound crew, respected one another. Even when people were tired, they were still polite. That attitude really stuck with me.\n\nI learned that how I treat people — not just the audience, but also my colleagues, the costume team, and the stage managers — really affects how smoothly everything runs and whether people want to be around you.\n\nOn the other side, Disney valued its performers. It was very serious about safety and well-being. We had good medical insurance, which is important for dancers.\n\nAfter one year, I decided not to re-audition for contract renewal. I wanted to explore new challenges.\n\nI'm now a freelance dancer, teacher, and choreographer in Singapore, where I try to infuse Disney's spirit of \"magic\" into my work.\n\nDance training can be stressful for kids, especially during exams or competitions, so I try to keep that sense of fun alive and create an environment where my students feel safe and excited to learn.\n\nThe magic is about creating that little moment in class where someone feels proud or inspired.\n\nI also try to bring that same magic into my choreography. AI plays a small part in helping me express my ideas.\n\nAs a choreographer, I often have to write synopses for school performances or competitions, and that part is difficult because dancers think in movement, not in sentences.\n\nRecently, I started using ChatGPT to help organize my ideas. I don't let it write for me, but I use it to structure what I already have and express my thoughts more clearly.\n\nI'm also open to trying AI software for large-scale productions with apps that can help with pinpoint formations, map things out, and visualise spacing.\n\nOver the past two years, I was a choreographer for Singapore's National Day Parade performances, overseeing close to 600 students for one of them. I remember spending weeks figuring out formations by hand, staying up until 3 a.m. or 4 a.m., moving people around in Excel.\n\nIf AI could help with that, it would save so much time.\n\nBut technology can only assist — the emotion behind the movement still has to come from people.",

One video on X showed at least five Waymos crowding an intersection, forcing human drivers to maneuver around them.\n\nThe power outage in San Francisco has caused Waymo’s self-driving cars to come to a halt, leading to traffic disruptions across the city. https://t.co/8vPCrKF9ze pic.twitter.com/kXjOJ3UN4c\n\nWaymo suspended its ride-hailing services on Saturday in response to the power outage, which affected about 130,000 Pacific Gas & Electric customers.\n\nOn Sunday, a spokesperson for Waymo told Business Insider that the company had resumed its service in the area.\n\n\"Yesterday's power outage was a widespread event that caused gridlock across San Francisco, with non-functioning traffic signals and transit disruptions,\" the spokesperson said. \"While the failure of the utility infrastructure was significant, we are committed to ensuring our technology adjusts to traffic flow during such events.\"\n\nOn X, Tesla CEO Elon Musk used the incident to promote his company's own robotaxis. \"Tesla Robotaxis were unaffected by the SF power outage,\" he wrote.\n\nTesla and Waymo are direct competitors in the autonomous ride-hailing market, but are relying on different technologies to get them there.\n\nTesla robotaxis use cameras and AI to find their way around. Waymo uses a suite of light sensors, radar, cameras, and detailed maps that are uploaded and regularly updated. That means sudden changes to the areas where a Waymo robotaxi operates could impact its ability to navigate.\n\nWaymo, owned by Alphabet Inc., debuted its autonomous ride-hailing service to the public in 2018 in the Phoenix metro area.\n\nThe company has expanded its services to other cities, including Austin and Atlanta, through a partnership with Uber, but it hasn't all been smooth sailing.\n\nIn May, Waymo recalled the software for more than 1,200 cars after some collided with \"chains or gates.\" More recently, a Waymo vehicle hit and killed a beloved bodega cat in San Francisco, sparking outrage from residents.",

    "fullText": "The Israeli military said it shot dead a Palestinian “suspected of hurling a block” at soldiers on Saturday during an operation in the occupied West Bank town of Qabatiya.\n\nVideo reviewed by CNN shows a soldier shooting the teen when he is just feet away. In an earlier statement, the military did not use the word “suspected,” and said the person “hurled a block toward the soldiers.”\n\nThe Palestinian was identified as 16-year-old Rayan Muhammad Abdul Qader Abu Mualla by the Ministry of Health, citing the Palestinian General Authority of Civil Affairs (PGACA), who said his body is still being held by Israel after he was killed in the Al-Sab’aneh neighborhood in Qabatiya.\n\nA 26-second security camera video shared on social media and geolocated by CNN to Al-Sab’aneh, shows what appears to be the moment Israeli troops shot Abu Mualla.\n\nIn the video, a person walks down an alley towards two helmeted soldiers crouched partially behind a corner. The person is just about to reach the corner when one soldier raises his rifle and fires at point blank range, causing the person to collapse backwards.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in its initial statement that its soldiers had been attacked by a “terrorist.” The video shows the 18 seconds before the shooting, in which time nothing appears to be thrown from the alley the Palestinian teenager comes from. His left hand, however, is obscured. It was not immediately clear who captured the footage, who initially released it, or what happened before the video begins.\n\nOn Saturday, the Israeli news site Ynet published what it says is a photo of Abu Mualla’s left hand clutching a chunk of concrete, taken after his death. CNN could not verify whether the photo is of the same person in the security footage.\n\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent said that Israeli troops blocked its emergency workers from reaching the scene of the shooting.\n\nA set of videos geolocated by CNN show an ambulance, with its emergency lights on, stopped about 650 feet away from the site of the shooting.\n\nAsked for comment on the video and the allegation that emergency workers were blocked from reaching Abu Mualla, the IDF said: “Yesterday (Saturday), a Palestinian suspected of hurling a block at IDF soldiers was shot. The incident is under review.”\n\nLate on Saturday, Abu Mualla’s school announced on Facebook that it would close on Sunday in honor of his memory and pushed exams a week ahead.\n\nIn a separate incident on Saturday, the Ministry of Health said the IDF shot and killed a 22-year-old Palestinian man named Ahmed Saed Ziyoud in Silat al-Harathiya, a town north of Jenin in the West Bank.\n\nThe IDF said in a statement on Telegram that it shot an individual in Silat al-Harathiya who “hurled an explosive” toward soldiers.\n\nOn Sunday, the military wing of the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine, said he was a fighter in the Al-Quds Brigades. He was shot by an Israeli sniper’s bullet during the IDF storming of the town.\n\nCNN’s Dana Karni contributed to this report.",

    "description": "Excavations revealed everything from a 14th-century Black Death group burial to three skeletons from the late 12th or early 13th centuries buried in coffins.",
    "fullText": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nHere’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nThe first excavation at the famed Tower of London in a generation uncovered more than 20 skeletal remains.\n\nExcavations revealed everything from a 14th-century Black Death group burial to three skeletons from the late 12th or early 13th centuries buried in coffins.\n\nThe on-site chapel is serving as a tell-all of London’s medieval history.\n\nA rare dig into the soil of the famed Tower of London—the first excavation at the site in a generation—yielded two skeletons from around 1500. As archaeologists dug deeper into the ground, they found roughly 20 more burials, including one group grave likely tied to the 1348 “Black Death” plague.\n\n“Undertaking these two excavations has provided us with a generational opportunity to enhance our understanding of the evolution off the Chapel of Saint Peter ad Vincula, and the buildings which stood before it,” Alfred Hawkins, curator of historic buildings at Historic Royal Palaces, the organization that oversees the Tower, said in a statement.\n\nThe dig began as a trial excavation in 2019 to prepare the on-site Chapel Royal of St Peter ad Vincula for a new elevator. The archaeologists helming the excavation discovered the remains of two skeletons. Subsequent excavations outside the chapel as deep as 10 feet below the surface revealed everything from a 14th-century Black Death group burial to three skeletons from the late 12th or early 13th centuries buried in coffins—an unusually expensive burial for that time.\n\nJane Sidell, principal inspector of ancient monuments at Historic England, said the team is already gaining insight into the residents of the Tower in a way they never have before. “This is just the tip of the iceberg,” she said in a statement. “There is so much more to learn through further analysis about the people as well as the buildings of one of England’s most evocative historic monuments.”\n\nThe Tower of London was built alongside the River Thames in the 1070s as a royal palace. It also served as a prison for high-status individuals (including King Henry VI), and housed the country’s Royal Mint. But it has seemingly almost always had a chapel on its grounds.\n\nThe current parish church for the residents of the Tower of London was built in 1520, after a 1512 fire devoured the one King Edward I built in 1287. A compacted layer of stone found in the recent excavation could be a 1240 project at the site led by Henry III, showing there was a chapel before 1287.\n\nAnd since the current chapel sits atop the same land as the Tower’s previous chapel foundations, burials aplenty are to be expected. Of the recent finds, the older burials could have even been buried inside one of the long-destroyed chapels. “Typically, if you’re buried closer to the church, you’re more important, and if you’re buried inside the church, you’re much, much more important, and if you’re buried under the altar, you are the most important person,” Hawkins said, according to National Geographic.\n\nKnown burials at the site include three queens and two Catholic saints, but finding out more about the unknown skeletons could help piece together the medieval story of the site.\n\n“The new excavations provide the opportunity to transform our understanding of the Tower’s community,” Katie Faillace from Cardiff University’s School of History, Archaeology, and Religion, said in a statement. “Our work uses a biomolecular technique known as isotope analysis, which tells us about health, diet, and mobility in the past, all from a tiny fragment of a tooth. This cutting-edge method was unparalleled potential for reconstructing the experiences of the people who lived and died at the Tower, allowing us to build a rich picture of individuals’ lives.”\n\nThe analysis on the first two skeletons starts developing that picture. Richard Madgwick, archaeological scientist at Cardiff University and part of the team, told National Geographic that one individual was likely a middle-aged female who died between 1480 and 1550. Clues indicate she likely lived as far away as Wales at one point, and had a diet featuring sugar—an expensive ingredient at the time.\n\nThe second skeleton belonged to a younger man who died around the same time. Details of his remains show a high-stress life that likely played out just north of London. His diet was much less exotic.\n\n“I’m looking forward to starting analysis of some of the other amazing finds we have uncovered along the way,” Hawkins said. “This is a very, very rare opportunity to get this information.”\n\nAlong with the remains, the team found a rare burial shroud from the late 12th or early 13th century (fabric doesn’t usually last through the ages), jewelry, shards of stained glass, and rare grave goods in the form of funerary incense pots dated to between 1150 and 1250 (with charcoal still inside them).\n\n“At the moment we’ve got these lovely two biographies,” Madgwick said. “It hints at the dynamic movement of people and the dynamic life trajectories of the people who were buried in the Tower, but it’s going to be really exciting to see whether we’ve picked two anomalies, or whether we see the broader range of lifeways that we see of those buried here.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

The boss reportedly bought himself a Ferrari and gave his 17-year-old daughter a brand-new Lamborghini Urus. Meanwhile, employees were denied a cost-of-living adjustment and forced into a cheaper health insurance plan.\n\nThe employee wrote, “This man and his attorneys have the gall to deny us a cost of living increase and just switched our health insurance to United Healthcare to save a few dollars.”\n\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nDeloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\n\nOne moment that particularly stung involved a coworker who died in a car accident. The company owner sent the widow a card with $50 in cash and a $50  gift card. The employees, by contrast, pooled $1,800 of their own money to support the grieving family.\n\n“The employees contributed to the funeral and final expenses,” the poster added. “And he sent her $50 and a gift card.”\n\nThis touched off many responses from other workers with similar stories. One commenter wrote, “This happened at my husband’s old job. Everyone in the family got brand new cars, and they took away paid holidays and [paid time off]… they lost three people within a month.”\n\nAnother said they discovered their boss was sending offers on used Rolls-Royces on eBay, while refusing to increase pay.\n\nTrending: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace—Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\n\nThe post resonated because it reflects a broader frustration among American workers. Many commenters noted that lavish executive lifestyles often come directly at the expense of employees.\n\n“He isn't buying luxury cars despite not paying you and switching you to cheaper insurance,” one person wrote. “He is buying luxury cars because he's not paying you… That is your money.”\n\nAnother commenter summed it up like this: “Record profits are stolen wages.”\n\nPeople shared stories of bosses who slashed hours, removed retirement contributions, and still found ways to upgrade their luxury lifestyles. Several said they were pushed to donate paid time off to terminally ill coworkers while the owners hoarded profits.\n\nOne person recalled, “Two weeks later [after saying he couldn’t afford raises], he bought a fully loaded Rivian R1T in cash.”\n\nSee Also: Missed Tesla?

Another added, “Striking is reasonable, but starting a competing firm with highly motivated team members is even better.”\n\nStill, some felt hopeless, arguing that these issues are systemic. One commenter wrote, “This is 2025 USA in a nutshell.”\n\nWhether or not anything changes for the workers in the original post, the message from the thread is that when employees are asked to sacrifice while their bosses flaunt obscene wealth, it's not just bad optics; it feels like a slap in the face.\n\nRead Next: Wall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors — Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

    "description": "Watters, 47, recounted the alleged conversation to a large crowd at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest in Phoenix on Dec. 20",
    "fullText": "Fox News host Jesse Watters claimed that President Donald Trump told him he is building the new White House ballroom as a “monument” to himself\n\nHe added that Trump said he was doing so because “no one else will”\n\nWatters recounted the alleged conversation while speaking at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest in Phoenix on Dec. 20\n\nJesse Watters claims President Donald Trump told him he is constructing the new White House ballroom as a “monument” to himself — and that he’s doing it “because no one else will.”\n\nThe Fox News host recounted the alleged conversation while speaking at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest, a multiday conservative conference and festival in Phoenix, on Saturday, Dec. 20. A video of the moment has since been posted on X.\n\nWatters, 47, told the large crowd that he was sharing a meal with Trump, 79, when the president asked him if he wanted to see a rendition of “the big, beautiful ballroom.”\n\n“I said, ‘Sure, let me see it,’ “ Watters continued. “He [Trump] rolls the whole thing out. And guys, I don't know if you know this — the ballroom is huge. Like, I said, ‘Mr. President, the ballroom is four times the size of the White House.' ”\n\n“He said, ‘Jesse, it's a monument. I'm building a monument to myself — because no one else will,' \" Watters added, eliciting loud laughs from the audience.\n\nThe PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now!\n\nTrump recently said that the 90,000-square-foot ballroom, which is being built on the site of the former East Wing, will now cost $400 million — a significant jump from earlier estimates.\n\nTrump announced the updated price tag on Dec. 17 during a Hanukkah reception at the White House, where he also revealed that a federal judge has allowed construction on the controversial project to move forward. He repeated the figure multiple times while thanking the official for clearing the way for continued construction, describing the ruling as an act of “courage.”\n\nThe ballroom — which is being funded entirely by private donors, including a contribution from Trump himself — is expected to be completed by summer 2028.\n\nTrump has argued that the sprawling ballroom is needed so future presidents can host large events indoors rather than on the South Lawn.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nIt's unclear just how many people the space can accommodate. Trump told NBC News in September that it would hold up to 900 people; BBC reporting cites plans for a capacity of 1,350.\n\nOn Dec. 16, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon rejected a request from the National Trust for Historic Preservation to temporarily halt construction while the project undergoes additional review, the Associated Press reported.\n\nHowever, the judge said he plans to hold a hearing in January on the group’s request for a preliminary injunction and warned the administration not to make underground construction decisions that would lock in the design of the ballroom above ground, per Bloomberg.",

    "description": "Chief cricket reporter Stephan Shemilt marks the performances of the Australia and England teams after the third Test in Adelaide.",
    "fullText": "Australia have beaten England by 82 runs in the third Test to go 3-0 up and secure the Ashes at the earliest opportunity.\n\nHere are our player ratings for the Adelaide contest:\n\nBen Duckett – 2 – Arrived with a reputation as one of the best openers in the world, only to suffer a collapse in form and presence. Failures of others were predictable, Duckett's was not and is a huge concern.\n\nZak Crawley – 6 – Showed admirable fight and adaptability in England's second innings, but probably needs a hundred to be immune from a post-series clearout.\n\nOllie Pope – 2 – Test career over for now? Averages 17.6 in Ashes Tests. Since 1900, only England's Dennis Amiss has had as many as Pope's 16 innings in the top six in Ashes Tests and averaged less.\n\nJoe Root – 4 – Two starts, without making a telling contribution. Twice dismissed by Cummins, for whom Root is a bunny. The Yorkshireman must be pleased the Australia captain missed the first two Tests of the series.\n\nHarry Brook – 5 – Largely stayed true to his promise to \"rein it in\", but the second-innings dismissal reverse-sweeping Lyon was ugly. Would be a huge waste if Australia does not see his best on this tour.\n\nBen Stokes – 6 – Battled bravely in England's first innings, even if his resistance never seemed likely to turn into a trademark miracle. Did not bowl when England needed him on day three.\n\nJamie Smith – 6 – Finally got into the series with a counter-attacking 60 in the second innings, now has to kick on in Melbourne and Sydney.\n\nWill Jacks – 6 – A part-time spinner unfairly asked to do the job of a veteran. Resisted admirably with the bat, making himself harder to leave out.\n\nBrydon Carse – 5 – Continuing a bizarre tour of picking up wickets despite not bowling well. England have a decision to make over the Durham man in Melbourne.\n\nJofra Archer – 8 – Emerging as England's player of the tour. A maiden Test half-century and first five-wicket haul in six years. Demonstrating it was more than worth the wait for him to return to full fitness.\n\nJosh Tongue – 6 – Encouraging return after being overlooked for the first two Tests. Was the unfortunate bowler for the Khawaja drop and Carey Snicko shocker. Should get another go in Melbourne.\n\nJake Weatherald - 2 - Quiet game after a promising start to his Test career. Would be a potential Australian weakness for England to exploit had the Ashes not already been lost.\n\nTravis Head – 8 – Any flicker of hope England might have had was snuffed out by a century from South Australia's favourite son in the second innings. Head's promotion to open the batting is a defining moment in the outcome of the series.\n\nMarnus Labuschagne – 5 – No real contribution with the bat, but gets an extra mark apiece for two sensational catches at second slip. Still a nagging doubt he has a big score in him before the end of the series.\n\nUsman Khawaja – 7 – Took his chance after Steve Smith's illness, albeit via a life from Harry Brook. Should keep his place for Sydney.\n\nCameron Green – 4 – Could not produce a performance to match his huge Indian Premier League pricetag and batting two places too high. Took the important wicket of Brook in the first innings.\n\nAlex Carey – 8 – Challenging Mitchell Starc as player of the series. Loses a point because he should have been given out in the first innings.\n\nJosh Inglis – 4 – An important 32 when England sensed momentum on the first day, but hasn't fully taken his chance. Could be squeezed out when Smith returns.\n\nPat Cummins – 7 – How has this man not bowled since July? Immediately into the groove with relentless accuracy. Once again an Ashes-winning captain.\n\nMitchell Starc – 6 – Not touching the heights of the first two Tests, though bowled with high pace in the first innings and took the key wickets of Jamie Smith and Will Jacks on the final day.\n\nNathan Lyon – 6 – Broke England's resistance with a triple-wicket burst on the fourth evening, only to hobble off with a hamstring injury on the final day. Could be out for the series.\n\nScott Boland – 6 – Unsung hero of Australia's attack, keeping up the pressure when the superstars rest. Will be in the conversation to rest in Melbourne, the venue where he destroyed England four years ago.\n\n'Bazball as we knew it is in the skip - but McCullum has England future'\n\nBooze, beach, beaten – how England lost the Ashes\n\nThe 10 moments that decided the Ashes\n\nStokes wants to remain captain despite Ashes defeat",

    "fullText": "On the winter solstice, some light finally illuminated the darkness of Wilfried Nancy's opening 17 days as Celtic manager.\n\nAt the fifth time of trying, the Frenchman oversaw his first victory after four wretched defeats across the Scottish Premiership, League Cup and Europa League.\n\nIt keeps them within six points of leaders Hearts, having played a game fewer, and was likely as deserved a win as he has ever achieved given just how dominant his side were against Aberdeen at Celtic Park.\n\nFor 20 second-half minutes, Celtic were scintillating. Like a throwback to the good old days under Brendan Rodgers, Ange Postecoglou or even Martin O'Neill.\n\nWith 31 shots on goal, 10 on target and an xG (expected goals) of 4.5, Celtic should have been out of sight. The only thing for supporters to worry about should have been some last-minute Christmas shopping.\n\nBut when Kenan Bilalovic thudded his shot under Kasper Schmeichel to draw 10-man Aberdeen inexplicably level with 16 minutes to remaining, concerns were firmly focused on Nancy again.\n\nSince taking change from O'Neill less than three weeks ago, many fans will have wondered if he realised what he'd walked into.\n\nAnd while Nancy would be forgiven for failing to make sense of Sunday's ridiculous contest, he'll not be given so much leeway if the rays of light on show against Aberdeen don't turn into a full new dawn.",

    "fullText": "Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse pushed back hard against a fresh XRP manipulation claim after the token slid to $1.77 before rebounding toward $1.88 during a choppy December. The move capped a 5% weekly drop. Even though XRP still trades in a higher range since Ripple’s courtroom win over the SEC.\n\nThe comments arrive in a market where new XRP futures, ETFs, and a Ripple-backed stablecoin are all reshaping how money flows around the beloved community asset.\n\nGarlinghouse told CNN that “nobody is in a position to manipulate XRP prices.” he noted that XRP trades with multi‑billion‑dollar daily volume and tracks the crypto market rather than Ripple’s internal decisions. He said XRP is now too big and too liquid for one actor, Ripple’s backend included, to move it like a tiny micro‑cap coin.\n\nThink of liquidity like the size of the swimming pool. A small bucket of water can change the level in a kiddie pool, but not in an Olympic one. Garlinghouse said low‑liquidity tokens are vulnerable to pump‑and‑dump games, but XRP’s scale makes that far harder.\n\nAccording to CoinDesk, XRP futures volume alone recently ran toward $4 billion during a sharp move, which is not the profile of a thin, easily pushed market. Although it’s dropping now, so does the crypto market.\n\n(source – Ripple Future Volume Today, CoinGecko)\n\nHe also emphasized that banks using Ripple’s payment technology purchase XRP on the open market, not through undisclosed sweetheart deals. These large buyers often agree to lockup terms so they cannot instantly flip all their tokens back into cash, which helps smooth out sudden dumps. For a beginner, this means institutional players usually face guardrails that you, as a small trader, do not see but still benefit from.\n\nDISCOVER: 16+ New and Upcoming Binance Listings in 2025\n\nOne long‑running fear in the XRP community: Ripple owns a huge stash and might “dump” it on the market. Ripple now keeps around 34.4 billion XRP in escrow and 5.1 billion in spendable wallets, releasing 1 billion each month, then relocking most of it. That schedule informs you in advance how much XRP might enter the market, which is important because sudden selling is what usually scares prices the most.\n\nGarlinghouse said Ripple usually keeps only about 200 million XRP per month for operations and returns the rest to escrow. He admitted in an older Financial Times quote that Ripple would not be cash-flow positive without XRP sales, but he argued that those sales now follow a predictable and transparent pattern. As a beginner, you do not need to love that model, but you at least know the faucet is on a timer, not a random fire hose.",

Those affected by the shake-up are not losing their foreign service jobs but will be returning to Washington for other assignments should they wish to take them, the officials said.\n\nThe State Department declined to comment on specific numbers or ambassadors affected, but defended the changes, calling them “a standard process in any administration.” It noted that an ambassador is “a personal representative of the president and it is the president’s right to ensure that he has individuals in these countries who advance the America First agenda.”\n\nAfrica is the continent most affected by the removals, with ambassadors from 13 countries being removed: Burundi, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Madagascar, Mauritius, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Somalia and Uganda.\n\nSecond is Asia, with ambassadorial changes coming to six countries: Fiji, Laos, the Marshall Islands, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines and Vietnam affected.\n\nFour countries in Europe (Armenia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Slovakia) are affected; as are two each in the Middle East (Algeria and Egypt); South and Central Asia (Nepal and Sri Lanka); and the Western Hemisphere (Guatemala and Suriname).\n\nPolitico was the first to report on the ambassadorial recalls, which have drawn concern from some lawmakers and the union representing American diplomats.",

    "fullText": "The Kennedy Center is already losing performers after Donald Trump slapped his name on the storied arts institution.\n\nKristy Lee, a folk singer scheduled to perform at the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts on Jan. 14, is in talks to cancel her appearance, her spokesperson told NOTUS, as other artists also move to sever ties with the venue.\n\nOne performer, who spoke to NOTUS on the condition of anonymity, said Trump’s renaming had left a permanent “stain” on the center.\n\nAnother lamented what the Kennedy Center once represented—for artists and for the country at large. “I feel really badly for performers, not just for performers but for the people who work there,” they said.\n\n“Kennedy Center is supposed to be a memorial, focusing on being nonpartisan. A place where people, it doesn’t matter what party they believe in, should be performing and experiencing the arts together regardless of what their party is. And it has not become that.”\n\nOther artists who reluctantly chose to keep their scheduled performances at the center told NOTUS they are doing so as an act of resistance to the 79-year-old president.\n\n“Reality show personality and con artist aren’t the type of artist the center showcases,” one artist said. They added that they “don’t associate the arts, or this building, with Trump.”\n\n“And I guess the real debate up till now is what you boycott it and help ensure it goes down the tubes,” the musician added. “Or do you do the concerts and keep the audiences that love going to the Kennedy Center. And make sure there’s something there after this guy leaves. And it could be restored from however he trashes it.”\n\nThe backlash follows an announcement Thursday from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt that the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts would be tackily renamed to include Trump’s name after a vote by the venue’s board, which is now stacked with MAGA loyalists.\n\n“Congratulations to President Donald J. Trump, and likewise, congratulations to President Kennedy, because this will be a truly great team long into the future!” she wrote on X. “The building will no doubt attain new levels of success and grandeur.”\n\nThe board includes White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles; Attorney General Pam Bondi; second lady Usha Vance; Deputy White House Chief of Staff Dan Scavino; and Allison Lutnick, the wife of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.\n\nA source told CNN that Trump phoned into Thursday’s meeting ahead of the vote.\n\nA day later, the president’s name was quickly and tackily plastered onto the center’s building, which now reads: “The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.”\n\nDemocrats and historians, however, have insisted that renaming the venue requires an act of Congress.\n\n“The Kennedy Center was named by law. To change the name would require a revision of that 1964 law,” Ray Smock, a former House historian, wrote in an email to the Associated Press. “The Kennedy Center board is not a lawmaking entity. Congress makes laws.”\n\nMeanwhile, many of Kennedy’s relatives have expressed their outrage.\n\n“Three years and one month from today, I’m going to grab a pickax and pull those letters off that building, but I’m going to need help holding the ladder,” Kerry Kennedy, 66, wrote on X Friday.\n\nThe lawyer and former president’s niece added: “Are you in? Applying for my carpenter’s card today, so it’ll be a union job!!!”\n\nTrump set his sights on the center months ago and has repeatedly suggested it be renamed the Trump-Kennedy Center in public remarks and on social media. At the same time, ticket sales have reportedly plummeted and audiences thinned since Trump’s takeover.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",
