    "fullText": "Mets slammed as “doomed” by former MLB execs after Alonso news originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIt took less than a day for the mood of New York Mets’ observers to hit rock bottom. After losing All-Star closer Edwin Diaz to the Los Angeles Dodgers, former MLB general managers Jim Duquette, Jim Bowden and Steve Phillips spent the morning on MLB Network Radio suggesting the New York Mets should be “panicked.” Hours later, it was reported that Pete Alonso agreed to a five-year, $155 million deal with the Baltimore Orioles, and the same group reportedly shifted their tone to “doomed.”\n\nSNY broadcaster and former Met Ron Darling on MLB Network’s MLB Tonight said he was “flabbergasted.”\n\nAlonso’s departure is not only a big blow to the Mets’ offseason plans, but it ends a franchise era.\n\nAlonso, who turned 31 Sunday,  hit .272 with 38 home runs, 126 RBI and an .871 OPS over 162 games last season. He finishes his Mets tenure with 264 career home runs, the most in franchise history, along with 712 RBI and a .253 career batting average.\n\nThat’s elite middle-of-the-order production vanishing overnight.\n\nNew York also missed on a potential left-handed power fit when Kyle Schwarber re-signed with Philadelphia.  Brandon Nimmo’s departure via trade to the Texas Rangers for Marcus Semien creates even more questions for the Mets.\n\nEven at closer, the Mets are asked to trust Devin Williams, a new arrival and high-pressure answer after Diaz left for Los Angeles on a three-year, $69 million deal. Mets GM David Stearns said they think that Williams’ career-worst year against the Mets in 2025 was because he was “unlucky.”\n\nWith the biggest names gone, Stearns must get creative. Options remain, but none come without risk — and none replace Alonso’s presence by themselves.\n\nHere are the most realistic paths still on the board:\n\nCody Bellinger\nA lefty bat with defensive flexibility in the outfield and at first base. Once an MVP-caliber slugger, he hit .272 with 29 homers last season.\n\nOne of the few impact bats left on the market after 2025: last season he hit .266 with 22 home runs, 73 RBI, 91 runs scored, and compiled an .841 OPS in 136 games.\n\nAlex Bregman\nA high-floor infielder who could stabilize the batting order, but doesn’t replace pure first-base power. He’s one of the bigger bats still available.\n\nBo Bichette\nMore contact hitter than slugger, but an impact offensive piece who could reshape the overall lineup profile.\n\nThose names provide lineup value, but the Mets lost production and popular players.\n\nAlsono was not only a durable first baseman who has led the MLB in home runs since his debut. Diaz was a closer who electrified Citi Field with his entrances and dominated in high leverage.  Fans identified with them, and their teammates reportedly embraced them.\n\nThe former GMs on MLB Network Radio have seen enough offseasons to know when desperation is creeping in. Two franchise pillars are gone. The division remains brutal. And the fan base just watched its most iconic slugger pack for Baltimore.\n\nDarling was blunt in his assessment, too.\n\n\"This is a real loss for the New York Mets,\" Darling said.\n\nIf the Mets don’t respond aggressively and fast, this winter may be remembered not as a turning point but as a full-scale collapse.",

    "description": "When looking at John Cena’s legacy, it boils down to a trio of personas that embodied the superstar who defined a generation.",
    "fullText": "How do you effectively sum up the career of a legend?\n\nHow do you take a quarter-century worth of accomplishments, championships and memories and boil them down into something easily digestible, yet appropriately meaningful at the same time?\n\nHow do you quantify a once-in-a-generation run in a realm that doesn’t track bumps taken, finishers hit or smiles delivered?\n\nIn an industry as unquantifiable as professional wrestling, you swerve everyone, and look at the numbers.\n\nThere’s the biggest one, 17, representing the record number of world championships won. There’s 26, the number of years wrestled when all is said and done. There’s 1,554, the tally of matches to this point in the career. There’s 100, the number of victories at premium live events — when the lights are brightest.\n\nAll of those are great, but they fail to encapsulate John Cena, who, on Saturday, will wrestle for the final time in a WWE ring. For Cena, the number that should exemplify his legacy is three.\n\nThere’s an intended irony in describing a retiring pro wrestler’s career with the number three, as it represents a finality in the ring, but when looking at Cena’s legacy, it boils down to a trio of personas that embodied the superstar who defined a generation.\n\nFrom an in-ring perspective, Cena’s style worked incredibly well for what it was.\n\nNever a high-flyer or traditional worker — there’s a reason it took until his final months for Cena to capture the WWE Intercontinental Championship, known as the worker’s title — the early portions of Cena’s career became defined by a power-based attack and a moveset that came to be known as the “Five Moves of Doom,” which would usually be unleashed after taking a beating from his opponent and ultimately result in a win. The rinse-and-repeat formula earned him the nickname “Super Cena” from fans who were disenfranchised with the repetitive nature of his matches.\n\nStill, there were many high points that proved these criticisms of Cena to be largely unfounded and subjective.\n\nDuring the late 2000s, Cena’s rivalries with Shawn Michaels, Randy Orton and Edge produced classics that still hold up today. His return at the 2008 Royal Rumble is among the biggest in the history of the event. Cena headlined six WrestleManias, including three consecutive from 2011 to 2013, wrestling a pair of underrated matches against Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson in a proverbial passing-of-the-torch moment. His 2011 Money in the Bank championship match against CM Punk still stands out as one of the best of his career and helped cement Punk’s status as a legend in WWE.\n\nCena’s style was what fit for himself and WWE at the time. It was part of what made him such an excellent contrast with the likes of Michaels, Edge, Punk and, later in his career, AJ Styles, all of whom had higher in-ring work rates. He also had seemingly limitless strength, lifting Big Show, Mark Henry and, at times, multiple wrestlers onto his shoulders for his Attitude Adjustment finisher.\n\nThe arrival of Styles helped Cena shed any perceived slights about his in-ring ability. Cena and Styles met for the first time on a WWE PLE at Money in the Bank in 2016, but their best match of that initial run came at SummerSlam that same year. It was an instant classic, showcasing the contrasting styles of both men and seemingly unlocking something in Cena as the quality of his matches quickly began to outweigh the sheer quantity of them.\n\nThroughout the 2010s, Cena also quelled misconceptions about burying talent. Alongside the “Super Cena” critiques came the notion that his star shined at the expense of younger talent. While it’s not an uncommon criticism at the top of the card in professional wrestling, in Cena's case, he played a pivotal role in introducing the Nexus and elevating the United States Championship, with his open challenge serving as the main roster introductions for the likes of Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn.\n\nThis final run as an in-ring performer has been among Cena’s best — again, quality over quantity.\n\nCena’s shown a mastery of ring psychology, an expanded moveset and the same Herculean power that made him one of the greatest of all time. Renewed rivalries with Orton and Punk have hit every note of nostalgia you would expect. His final match with Cody Rhodes provided both another five-star effort and his own passing-of-the-torch moment, 12 years after WrestleMania 29. His reunion with AJ Styles was a swan song for two icons that will not be matched any time soon. Perhaps the most telling thing about Cena's entire run is that, despite what he has said in interviews about this final year, he never appeared to slow down in the ring.\n\nIn many ways, Cena probably shouldn’t have been as successful as he has been. After bursting onto the scene in 2001 more as “The Prototype” than “John Cena,” it took the Massachusetts native some time to find his footing in WWE.\n\nUltimately, Cena’s charisma and talent as an entertainer won out, leading to his freestyle-rapping, jersey-wearing “Doctor of Thuganomics” character. What feels dated in 2025 worked immensely for Cena 20 years ago, connecting him with the crowd in a way that would only enhance and evolve at seemingly every turn for the next two decades.\n\nCena faced two major transitional hurdles in his career, particularly as he moved up the card in WWE.\n\nFirst, with Stone Cold Steve Austin retired and The Rock focused on Hollywood, there was a void as WWE moved from the beloved “Attitude Era” around 2002 into what is now looked back on as the “Ruthless Aggression Era.” Cena — and fellow OVW standouts Batista, Brock Lesnar and Orton — helped bridge the gap, even with legends like The Undertaker, Michaels and Triple H still occupying main-event slots, but none reached the heights that Cena did.\n\nThe second challenge ran parallel to the first. While violence and sex appeal helped WWE win the Monday Night Wars, the company was set to move into a more family-friendly direction by the summer of 2008: The “PG Era.”\n\nCena, after rising to fame as the “Doctor of Thuganomics,” essentially scrubbed his character, trading the throwback jerseys for brightly colored WWE-branded merch, renaming his signature move from its original moniker — the F-U — and weaving in themes of patriotism and military after starring in “The Marine.” While the trademark intensity was still there, the message and tone shifted in a way that matched the direction WWE wanted to go and cemented Cena as the purest babyface character of the past quarter century.\n\nThroughout all of it, Cena’s ability to connect with an audience and deliver meaningful promos never wavered. There was merchandise, catchphrases, a rap album — including his own now-timeless theme — movies, commercials and plenty more that all played a role in building Cena up into one of the most impactful entertainers in pro-wrestling history.\n\nAs Cena’s career progressed, particularly as he shifted from full-time WWE superstar to dipping his foot into the Hollywood pond, a new authenticity came when he picked up the microphone in the ring. Rather than sticking strictly to kayfabe, Cena consistently broke the fourth wall in a way that elevated his segments, while also serving as a wink and a nod to a professional wrestling culture that was increasingly online and connected to behind-the-scenes happenings.\n\nEven during his retirement tour, Cena showed new depth as an entertainer. Say what you will about his overall 2025 heel run, Cena strung us along in the early part of the year and the turn itself was arguably as stunning as we’ve seen since July 7, 1996. Then, when it was time to turn again, Cena flipped the switch and it was back to business.\n\nThe final pillar of Cena’s legacy is perhaps the most important. Beyond the 17 world championships or the millions of dollars in merchandise and tickets sold stands Cena’s role as an ambassador for WWE.\n\nFor 20 years, Cena served as a reliable spokesperson for WWE, capable of presenting the very best the company had to offer with a squeaky-clean image and charisma for days.\n\nWWE needed to promote an event? Send Cena to Kimmel or Conan.\n\nNickelodeon needs a host for the Kid’s Choice Awards? Call Cena.\n\nFor a billion-dollar company, Cena was the QB1 of QB1s when it came to public relations, but it stretched beyond that.\n\nCena has worked extensively with Make-A-Wish throughout his career, granting more than 650 wishes for sick children and their families as the current Guinness World Record holder for the foundation. As much as the IWC will debate star ratings or get into tribal feuds over promotions, Cena’s generosity and kind heart are an undeniable measure of his greatness not just as a performer, but as a human being.\n\nCena embraced his role as a real-life superhero for millions of kids, offering up just a few minutes of his time to brighten up the lives of those who needed it most.\n\nHaving examined the elements that made Cena who he is today, we have to ask how do you sum it all up?\n\nHave there been and will there be better wrestlers than Cena? Yes.\n\nHave there been and will there be better entertainers than Cena? Yes, but there’s so much subjectivity involved that it’s very much up for debate.\n\nHave there been or will there be better ambassadors than Cena? Almost certainly not.\n\nIn a world built on kayfabe, Cena brought an authenticity that overcame industry-wide shifts, thriving across multiple decades, showcasing longevity that lasted from flip phones to FaceTime.\n\nIn a landscape that begs for change — in character or company — Cena embodied his motto, “hustle, loyalty, respect\" better than maybe anyone ever, and when he did turn, the wrestling world collectively said “no thanks, we like it better the old way.”\n\nWith the last time finally being now, it’s all clear:\n\nWe won’t see another John Cena again.",

    "fullText": "43 degrees at MetLife Stadium in December taint so bad.\n\nSure; it’s the Jets (and a Jets team with a boatload of injuries, to boot). But being up 21-0 with 3:39 left in the 1st quarter is a pretty solid opening salvo.\n\nHeavy sets, extra linemen masquerading as tight ends, tight ends who value blocking as much as running routes, fullbacks, et al, all in support of Dominant De’Von (Achane), plus the (albeit brief so far) emergence of Jaylen Wright, and a little sprinkle of OGII action on top have made for a pretty prolific rushing offense as of late.\n\nIt’s almost as if a head coach who came to Miami from a run-first team in San Francisco where he served as the run game coordinator could prioritize the run game a bit.\n\nI think Mike McDaniel got distracted by the shiny jangly keys that are Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle, found a method that highlighted their abilities, and went bananas with it until it fell to pieces.\n\nIf he can remember the face of his father and continue to build the offense on a solid foundation of ground and pound backed by play action, supplemented by ‘eye candy’, and seasoned with explosive plays, that’s a scheme that can find sustained success, even if the quarterback isn’t a world beater on his own (aka current form Tua).\n\nThe pass game has gone from elite timing with receivers running free as recently as only two seasons ago to borderline chaos with multiple throws per game that should be easy turnovers. Minimizing that risk is yet another reason to keep conducting the Totin’ Train over and over until the defense just goes home.\n\nSure; it’s the Jets (and a Jets team with a first time UDFA rookie quarterback, to boot). But 6 sacks, 3 INTs, and 228 total yards given up is a pretty solid second act.\n\nThe four man rush of Bradley Chubb, Chop Robinson, Zach Sieler, and a rotating rookie DT, has finally found a way to generate consistent pressure. Jordyn Brooks continues to rack up tackles in the middle, while the backend, led by Rasul Douglas, Jack Jones, and Minkah Fitzpatrick, has been smothering opposing pass catchers.\n\nIt may end up being too little too late, but when considering the team’s long term prospects, it’s encouraging to note that the younger players, particularly the rookie defensive tackles Kenneth Grant, Jordan Phillips, and Zeek Biggers, have begun to find their footing.\n\nSome of the depth players got reps against the Jets, which is a very un-Dolphin like development. Ethan Bonner even had the audacity to pull down a one-handed interception to seal the game, as if he played for a team for whom things like that happen.\n\nWhile it would certainly be preferable that the defense came out swinging from day one (which they most certainly did not), it’s better late than never, assuming they can all carry that growth into the future without needing another ~7 week spin up time each year. If the team could land some top tier talent at only a handful of spots on defense (linebacker and cornerback, especially when factoring in depth), they could really be cooking with peanut oil.\n\nSure; it’s the Jet— wait, that doesn’t apply to this one. The Dolphins’ Special Teams was bad, even though the Jets are bad.\n\nThere’s nothing quite like surrendering a punt return touchdown to snuff out the previously total domination of momentum and ensuring that the game couldn’t be a complete cake walk.\n\nThe sad reality is: it doesn’t take a lot to derail a middling team. And, despite their current four game win streak, Miami is a middling team (as evidenced by a 6-7 record).\n\nWithin minutes, this game went from a massive blowout to within two scores while Miami threw incompletions and near interceptions galore.\n\nSuddenly, it seemed like the game would be a back and forth affair. At one point, the teams traded punts five times before Miami hit a field goal. Then, they traded punts five more times.\n\nI’m just saying: If the Special Teams unit doesn’t give up that punt return touchdown, maybe everyone doesn’t bog down for 10 drives and Miami cruises to an even easier win.\n\nAlso, Jake Bailey kicked a bunch and, despite Spero Dedes insisting on calling him ‘The Pro Bowler’ all game, he wasn’t Pro Bowl caliber.\n\nAnd you know what else? They also went ahead and surrendered a fake punt conversion on a 4th and 8, just for funsies.\n\nExcept for Riley Patterson. He’s still kicking it (hah!), including a field goal over 50 yards, which is historically his bugaboo.\n\nEveryone be more like that guy.\n\nDe’Von Achane went down with a rib injury, which has since been determined to not be a broken bone, which is supes lucky.\n\nI love Achane and I demand you all do too but, in his stead, Jaylen Wright, who earlier in the season had been a healthy scratch on more than one occasion, carried the ball 24 times for 107 yards and 1 TD.\n\nWhile it’s obvious that Achane is RB1, and nearly RB1 of the entire league, it’s extremely reassuring that Miami’s backups can excel to the level they did in his absence.\n\nIt’s not an absence any of us wants to see for more than about 10 snaps at a time, but not having the kind of drop off that Miami typically experiences when a starter goes down (looking at you O-line of the past 20-ish years) is nothing short of a miracle.\n\n“Heresy!” you scream as you throw open your windows to scare the neighbors into agreement.\n\n“We always draft offensive linemen in the early rounds of the draft and it always works out! Just think of them all: Jake Long, Ja’Wuan James, Laremy Tunsil, Jonathan Martin, John Jerry, Dallas Thomas, Billy Turner, Michael Deiter, and now I’m depressed and I’ve forgotten my point and I’m going to have to let these people go before the cops get here!”\n\nI don’t have the data to back this up. I’m certain someone who pays for PFT does, but then I’d have to talk to another person and that sounds terrible. I just know that the Fins have racked up a ton of rushing yards over their four game win streak and, historically, they’ve been really bad at run blocking.\n\nPatrick Paul is up and coming, Savi has been improving throughout his rookie season, and Aaron Brewer is solid in the middle. Austin Jackson just came back from injury but, when healthy, is a good player. That just leaves Cole Strange, the formerly backup RG who [checks notes] was a *Patriots 1st round pick in 2022.\n\nI think the Fins might have a respectable offensive line.\n\nI don’t feel at home in this world anymore.\n\nThink Miami will extend their winning streak to five games? Think they’ll rush for over 100 yards against Pittsburgh? Think anything at all? Try to fire some neurons in the comments below.",

    "fullText": "Arsenal travel to Brussels to take on Club Brugge on Matchday 6 of the Champions League league phase. The Gunners have the only remaining perfect record in the competition and a win would all but guarantee one of those coveted top eight spots. Brugge have struggled in the CL this season, earning just four points through five matches. They need a result to keep themselves in the running for one of the last playoff round spots.\n\nIn a surprise move, Brugge sacked their manager Nicky Hayen on Monday, replacing him with Gent manager Ivan Leko. Here you go, Ivan. Your first match in charge is against Arsenal and you’ve had two days to prepare.\n\nThe Gunners are coming off a gut-punch, last-second loss to Aston Villa that snapped a long unbeaten streak in all competitions. They’ll be looking to get back to their winning ways quickly and probably appreciate having a game just a few days later to get right. Club Brugge have lost three of their last four matches — two in the league and a 3-0 humbling at Sporting CP. They are shipping goals at a concerning rate — three in each of their last three Champions League matches and have not kept a clean sheet in 10 straight in the competition. They’ve also struggled against English clubs in European competition lately to the tune of a 1W, 3D, 12L record.\n\nArsenal looked tired and leggy against Aston Villa. Mikel Arteta needs to get key guys some rest. But I don’t think that’s going to come in the Champions League, at least not from the start. If Arsenal get out to a multiple goal lead, Arteta will hopefully give guys a break, but the Arsenal manager has consistently shown that CL matches get first-choice lineups or close to it.\n\nOne name that will absolutely be on the teamsheet — Riccardo Calafiori. The Italian has to serve a yellow card suspension in the Premier League this coming weekend, so that’ll be his time off. Gabriel Jesus should be among the Arsenal substitutes. The Brazilian was added to the registered CL squad earlier this week in place of Max Dowman, who is expected to miss about two months with an ankle injury suffered in a closed-doors friendly.\n\nArsenal will be without the services of William Saliba (muscle problem), Declan Rice (illness), and Leandro Trossard (calf knock), but they could all be back for the weekend. Cristhian Mosquera (ankle), Gabriel (thigh), and Kai Havertz (knee) are out longer term for the Gunners.\n\nBrugge are down two keepers. Familiar face Simon Mignolet is out with a groin injury. His backup, Nordin Jackers, broke his ribs against Sporting in the CL. Dani van den Heuvel is between the sticks. Romeo Vermant may return from concussion. Midfielders Ludovit Reis and Lynnt Audoor are doubtful. Centerback Zaid Romero is questionable.\n\nLineups will be posted when available.\n\nWHO: Arsenal at Club Brugge\nWHAT: Champions League league phase match day 6.\nWHEN: Wednesday, December 10th, 12:00 pm PT | 3:oo pm ET | 8:00 pm GMT\nWHERE: Jan Breydel Stadium, Brussels\nHOW TO WATCH: Streaming on the Paramount+ app\n\nFor all your international streaming needs, check LiveSoccerTV.com.

There have been rumors suggesting the Los Angeles Dodgers could be closing in on a trade for Skubal; however, those rumors have been shut down.\n\nThe “Skubal to Dodgers” rumors at the Winter Meetings are all smoke and “not real,” as reported by FanSided’s Robert Murray on The Baseball Insiders. As of now, it doesn’t appear that Skubal will be traded from Detroit, but if an offer blows away the organization, it could entice them to pull the trigger.\n\nThe Tigers want to keep Skubal and pursue a trip to the 2026 World Series, but more needs to be done. If Detroit keeps the back-to-back AL Cy Young Award winner, it needs to make moves to maximize the 2026 season. If not, the Tigers would be better off trading Skubal to maximize his value.\n\nSkubal would demand a very, very big trade package, and unless a team is willing to meet Detroit’s demands, it doesn’t seem likely to happen this winter. The Tigers need to pick a lane on Skubal, but for now, the rumors of a trade to the Dodgers don’t seem to have any legs.\n\nBaltimore Orioles sign Pete Alonso to massive five-year contract\n\nBaltimore Orioles discussing historic trade with Washington in 2025\n\nLatest MLB Rumors on Braves Caution, Reds-Marte, Mets-Alonso, Blue Jays Trade",

    "description": "Why having a developmental program isn't bad.",
    "fullText": "Rutgers head coach Greg Schiano has made many claims that the Scarlet Knights are a “developmental program”, and for good reason. Over the years, Schiano and his company have taken lower-graded talent, even walk-ons, and turned them into capable starters at the college level. A few recent notable examples of this are offensive tackle Hollin Pierce (walk-on), wide receiver Christian Dremel (walk-on), cornerback Christian Braswell (two-star), safety Christian Izien (three-star), and running back Kyle Monangai (a low three-star). Out of those five players, four have landed on NFL teams, largely due to their exceptional development in college.\n\nThat development has continued into 2025 and has paid dividends on offense last season. Players like KJ Duff, Antwan Raymond, Athan Kaliakmanis, and many of the offensive linemen looked better this season than last. In other words, their college development continued at a very solid pace through the offseason. However, that trend did not continue on the defensive side of the ball. In fact, many players regressed in some areas.\n\nFor example, many of the transfers Rutgers brought in were completely ineffective. There were questions on whether grabbing players from lower levels would help the Knights, since it is a large jump from the group of five to the Big Ten, but to be reduced to what they were just doesn’t make sense. Not only were players like Bradley Weaver, Jett Elad, Eric O’Neill, and Jacobie Henderson solid starters at the lower level, they were stars. Stars who should have been able to adjust to the Big Ten if given the proper guidance. If a few of the defensive portal additions didn’t adjust properly, that would be a different story. However, since none of them did, other than Elad and O’Neill to a very late and very limited degree, it becomes clear that they were not developed properly to compete at this level once they got here.\n\nThe examples continue with returning players as well. Linebacker Dariel Djabome was a star for Rutgers last season. Safety Kaj Sanders showed a lot of promise in his freshman season. Both of them took a step back this season under new position coaches. Players don’t just forget how to play football. Stars don’t just forget how to be stars. The development from last year to this year did not continue, and as a result, players regressed.\n\nMany of the Rutgers faithful are disgruntled with the term “developmental program.” However, how much of that hostility has stemmed from the reality that this so-called developmental program did not develop much last season on defense? If the transfers were developed to be Big Ten-ready, and if the talent from last season on defense continued its progression, the term developmental program would seem more fitting. Perhaps it is not the notion of being a developmental program that’s the issue, but rather the execution of those claims.\n\nRutgers under Greg Schiano will always have the mindset of being a developmental program, and that isn’t necessarily a bad thing, especially for a program like Rutgers that can’t just recruit several five stars year in and year out. On offense this season, they showed that they can do just that. However, it is the several poor and inexperienced defensive coaching hires that the Knights have made that have made them deviate from actually developing the players on that side of the ball. If Rutgers football can make the appropriate coaching hires on defense this offseason, it should be able to get back on track towards becoming a better overall team.",

    "fullText": "The International Olympic Committee said on Wednesday it would announce eligibility criteria for transgender athletes early next year, after months of deliberation as it seeks to find a consensus on how to protect the female category.\n\nThe issue has been a source of controversy with no universal rule in place for the participation of transgender athletes at the Olympic Games.\n\nThe IOC, under new president Kirsty Coventry, did a U-turn in June, deciding to take the lead in setting eligibility criteria for Olympic participation, having previously handed responsibility to the individual sports federations, leading to a confusing patchwork of different approaches.\n\nIn September, Coventry set up the 'Protection of the Female Category' working group, made up of experts as well as representatives of international federations, to look into how best to protect the female category in sports.\n\n\"We will find ways to find a consensus that has all aspects covered,\" Coventry told a press conference on Wednesday following an IOC executive board meeting.\n\n\"Maybe it is not the easiest thing to do but we will try our best so when we talk about the female category we are protecting the female category.\"\n\nCoventry said a decision would come in the first months of 2026.\n\n\"We want to make sure we have spoken to all stakeholders, taken adequate time to cross the Ts and dot the Is,\" she said.\n\n\"The group is working extremely well. I don't want to try to constrain the working group by saying they need to have a specific deadline but I am hopeful in the next couple of months and definitely within the first quarter of next year we will have a clear decision and way forward which I think we are all looking forward to,\" said Coventry, a former Olympic swimming champion.\n\nBefore Coventry's decision in June, the IOC had long refused to apply any universal rule on transgender participation for the Games, instructing international federations in 2021 to come up with their own guidelines. Under current rules, still in force, transgender athletes are eligible to take part in the Olympics.\n\nOnly a handful of openly transgender athletes have taken part in the Games. New Zealand's Laurel Hubbard became the first openly transgender athlete to compete in a different gender category to that assigned at birth when the weightlifter took part in the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.\n\nCurrently some international federations have rules in place, but others have not yet reached that stage.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has banned transgender athletes from competing in sports in schools in the United States, which civil society groups say infringes on the rights of trans people, as Los Angeles prepares to host the 2028 summer Olympics.\n\nTrump, who signed the \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports\" order in February, has said he would not allow transgender athletes to compete at the LA Games.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: IOC's on gender eligibility to come in early 2026",

    "description": "The main ticket ballot for next summer's World Cup in North America opens on Thursday with 'record high' prices for fans.",
    "fullText": "The main ticket ballot for next summer's World Cup in North America opens on Thursday.\n\nIt's the first opportunity for fans to secure tickets since the draw was made and the full match schedule announced last week.\n\nFifa's pricing model has been criticised, with Football Supporters Europe warning of \"record high prices\" and \"huge financial risks\" to follow their teams.\n\nFrom an earlier phase, the price of tickets ranged from £45 to £5,915.\n\nSo what do we know about the tournament's controversial ticketing operation - and how can you secure tickets?\n\nFrom 16:00 GMT on Thursday, fans can apply for tickets on Fifa's website for the matches of their choice.\n\nEach household can request up to four tickets per match and a maximum of 40 across the tournament.\n\nThe application window runs until 13 January 2026. There is no advantage to applying early - all fixtures remain available throughout the entire period.\n\nOnce the window closes, Fifa will run a lottery to decide which applications are successful.\n\nFans will be notified by email in February and, if they have been allocated tickets, will be charged automatically.\n\nDynamic pricing - or \"variable pricing\" as Fifa calls it - will be used in some phases of World Cup ticket sales.\n\nHowever, the governing body has confirmed that it will not apply during the main ballot. The price you see at the start of the window will be the same at the end.\n\nPrices will still be set based on expected demand for each fixture, with high-profile games likely to cost more.\n\nFor now, Fifa hasn't published any official price lists. It is expected people will know the price of tickets they ballot for on Thursday when it opens.\n\nAt present, the best guide we have comes from fans who tracked prices during the earlier sale phase.\n\nFifa has promoted Category 4 tickets as \"an accessible entry point to the tournament\".\n\nBut their stadium maps suggest the amount of Category 4 seating is extremely limited, and Football Supporters Europe said \"their very existence is still subject to caution\".\n\nIn most venues, the bulk of the seating appears to fall into the more expensive Category 1 and 2 sections.\n\nEach participating nation receives 8% of the tickets for its matches to distribute to its own supporters.\n\nFor England and Scotland, these will be made available to members of the England Supporters Travel Club and the Scotland Supporters Club. Both groups will receive an email with an access code for a Fifa portal, where they can apply from 15 December to 13 January.\n\nThese tickets are allocated via a ballot weighted towards members with the highest loyalty points.\n\nPrices are likely to be in line with the main ballot, but FA allocation tickets cannot be resold.\n\nAllocations for teams that progress through the play-offs are expected be released after those ties are completed in March.\n\nFifa has created its own official platform where fans can resell tickets bought through other phases of the ticketing process.\n\nSellers can list at whatever price they choose, and Fifa takes a 15% fee from both the seller and the buyer.\n\nFifa says these fees are \"aligned with North American industry trends across various sports\" and insists all revenue will be \"reinvested to fuel the growth of the game\".\n\nIt has also warned supporters against using unofficial resale sites, saying tickets bought elsewhere \"may be subject to cancellation without notice\".\n\nOn the unofficial secondary market, the cheapest tickets for England and Scotland's group games are already listed at more than £450.\n\nFans looking for guaranteed tickets - and not concerned about cost - can opt for official hospitality packages.\n\nThese typically cost thousands of pounds and include premium seating, lounge access and upmarket dining.\n\nThe most exclusive option is Platinum Access. Pricing for this tier is only available on request and details are sparse, although promotional material does feature an image of a private jet.\n\nCloser to the tournament, any remaining ticket inventory will be released on a first-come, first-served basis, operating much like a standard online ticket sale.\n\nThis phase is expected to utilise dynamic or variable pricing, though unlike other industries, Fifa will manually alter prices based on demand rather than using an algorithm.\n\n\"Your ticket is not a visa,\" said United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio last month.\n\nIndeed, simply being a ticket holder does not guarantee entry to any of the host countries, Canada, Mexico or the US.\n\nFans planning to travel to the US should apply for either the Visa Waiver Programme (commonly known as an ESTA) or a Visitor Visa (B1/B2) depending on their nationality. UK citizens are normally eligible for an ESTA.\n\nCanada requires most visitors to obtain a visa or an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA), while Mexico offers visa-free entry to many nationalities, including UK travellers.\n\nUS embassies are giving priority appointments to World Cup ticket holders but are still encouraging fans to apply as soon as possible.\n\nIt is unclear how ticket holders from countries whose citizens are mostly banned from travelling to the US will fare.\n\nSeveral members of the Iranian delegation were refused entry to the country for the World Cup draw last week.",

    "fullText": "What’s likely to be a cruel twist to a celebratory start to the Niko Medved at Minnesota, the Gophers come into Mackey Arena on the heels of an upset win over the Hoosiers to move to 1-0 in the Big Ten.\n\nThat high might get ruined in West Lafayette tonight as a reeling Purdue team looks to get right after getting blown out at home by Iowa State on Saturday.\n\nThe 81-58 upset from the Cyclones to the then #1 Boilers is the worst home loss in history for a #1 seed.\n\nNow Purdue looks to move to 2-0 in the Big Ten for the first time in four seasons while reminding the college basketball landscape that one game won’t define it. \n\nPurdue cruised through its first win in conference against Rugers, at home, following a humbling loss to Iowa State, look for Purdue trying to crush Minnesota.\n\nUpset win gives Minnesota glimpse towards hope\n\nIt hadn’t been a clean start to its season. Minnesota, with its new head coach, Niko Medved, came into the IU game with a 4-4 record, losing to Missouri early and then taking a three-game losing streak into the December 3rd match up with Indiana at home.\n\nBut Medved’s system is starting to take hold for Minnesota. Something Painter highlighted as a strength of Medved’s teams. Minnesota has played at a glacial place this season, but in the half court the Golden Gophers get to work on its two favorite things: getting to the free throw line and cutting.\n\nPainter, prevewing Minnesota yesterday, mentioned how well Minnesota cuts and that will be Purdue’s priority on defense to try and stay with its collection of cutters as they move to try and get to the rim and open from three.\n\nMinnesota’s offense runs through Tyson who is one of the nation’s best shooters. At 6-7, Tyson would be dangerous under any condition, but he’s one of the best on the move shooters in the country. He’s able to make shots on the move, both with and without the ball, and carries a lot of water for an offense that doesn’t have a ton of shot makers.\n\nTyson will be an interesting problem for Purdue. Purdue doesn’t have great length on the wing so it has to put smaller guards/wings on big shooters. That was part of the problem against Iowa Stata when the game got away from Purdue. Milan Momcilovic is a 6-8 shooter and Purdue had no answer for him making some tough jumpers on the perimeter. Momcilovic was able to be comfortable getting shots over whoever Purdue had to put on him.\n\nTyson will present similar changes with less dangerous options around him. So will Purdue sell out to take Tyson’s jump shot away from him? Or can someone step up on the defensive end.\n\nTyson is also one of the nation’s best players at getting to the line. Purdue will need to limit that to keep him out of rhythm.\n\nMinnesota will want to grind the game\n\nIt was when Minnesota settled IU and got into slow post ups, collections of hand offs, and slow developing rolls to the rim that the Golden Gophers started to take it to the Hoosiers last week. It will need to keep the pace down again against Purdue. Purdue’s also one of the slowest teams in the country, but while maintaining elite efficiency on the offensive end. Minnesota won’t win a track meet with Purdue.\n\nMinnesota will need as few Purdue possessions as possible to have a chance. It will also want to make sure it limits Purdue’s ability to get in transition. Purdue is still an elite team in transition even if it doesn’t get into transition as much.\n\nMinnesota is hoping that the game against Indiana is a sign that Medved’s philosophy on both ends of the floor is starting to reach his players and the Gophers are starting to coalesce on the court. \n\n“I see really good offense and then their defense is really starting to pick up,” Matt Painter said about Minnesota.\n\nMinnesota has struggled to control the three-point line. Teams are making over 37% from three against them but has been surprisingly good rebounding and defending inside the arc. Purdue was just 4 of 18 against Iowa State but is still shooting better than 40% from three on the season.\n\nIsaac Asuma gets Minnesota moving and is a long armed, tough driver of the basketball.\n\nJaylen Crocker-Johnson is a versatile big capable of stretching the floor and switching on the floor defensively. He’s also the best rebounder for Minnesota and will be tasked with going up against Purdue’s elite size and at times trying to check Trey Kaufman-Renn.\n\nBobby Durkin is the most likely to go off out of nowhere Gopher. Durkin is another tall wing that’s struggled a bit with his shot, but has the ability to put up points from teh four spot with space.",

Mateos has experience with offensive coordinator Jeff Grimes, having worked with him at Baylor and BYU in the past.\n\nMateos has a tall development task ahead of him, as he’ll have to build up an offensive line laden with young talent and three potential departures (Riley Mahlman, Jake Renfro, Joe Brunner).\n\nWe’ll see if the Badgers choose to make any other major staff moves, but AJ Blazek’s departure is the first of the offseason.",

    "fullText": "Every year there are prospects and players whose strengths and weaknesses polarize A’s fans in their evaluations. It could be called The Daric Barton Rift, as Barton was one of the first young players to polarize AN into a debate frenzy that lasted longer than Daric’s career (and much longer than his ill-fated dive into a pool).\n\nTopping the list in 2025 is Henry Bolte, toolsy, young for his leagues, prone to Ks and with little consensus on his outfield work. You might be extremely bullish on Bolte’s future or you might be quite bearish. Chances are, though, you don’t sit in the middle.\n\nWith my luck, by the time this article is published Bolte will have been traded at the Winter Meetings, but in the off chance he’s still here let’s take a look at this “boom/bust” prospect that has AN so divided…\n\nIn 2022 the A’s made Bolte their 2nd round pick, 56th overall, following their 1st round selection of catcher Daniel Susac. Bolte was still 18 at the time and flashed some impressive power in his celebrational rounds of BP at the Oakland Coliseum.\n\nSince then, Bolte has climbed the minor league ladder spending 2023-25 at A, A+, AA, and AAA where his season ended August 31st and he had surgery to repair damage to his wrist he had been managing all season. He is expected to be ready for spring training.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons the “bullish” group believes in Bolte. They include:\n\nHe has always been young for his leagues but has still put up over 100 wRC+ at each level each season. That includes 130 wRC+ (.267/.368/.466) in 2024 across A+ and AA and 121 wRC+ (.284/.385/.427) in 2025 across AA and AAA.\n\nNo one can doubt his base stealing prowess. In 2025 Bolte not only swiped 44 bases he did it in 46 attempts. In 2024 he was 46 SB, 12 CS. Dude can fly on the bases and is getting better and better at it.\n\nThough his wrist sapped his power in 2025, there is little doubt about his ability to slug making him that coveted blend of speed and power.\n\nScouts and coaches have long raved about Bolte’s patience and discerning eye. While this also shows up in the weaknesses below, it has led him to a career .369 OBP in MiLB which is especially important when you are such a threat on the bases.\n\nDefensively, Bolte comes with two key tools for excelling in the outfield. He has great speed and he is known for his strong arm. As a result he is probably best suited to RF.\n\nThis all being said, there are also reasons the “bearish” group digs its feet in and implores the front office to see Bolte as a good trade chip rather than a piece of the future core. They include:\n\nBolte has strikeout issues and nothing derails a top prospect faster than a continued inability to make contact. While Bolte’s K rate improved in 2025, what it improved to was 28.9% down from the previous years’ 34.7% and 33.4%. Prospects with great tools who K at those rates in the minors have a very high “bust” rate overall.\n\nPart of Bolte’s issues with strikeouts come from what scouts have deemed excessive discernment and sometimes overthinking at the plate. Bolte has a pattern of getting too cerebral and not letting his natural talent take over, and it’s hard to know how much of this he can move past or how much is part of “who he is”.\n\nWhile Bolte has the tools to excel in the outfield, he doesn’t necessarily have the stats to match. Defensive metrics are few and far between as you go down the MiLB ladder, but Bolte’s error totals have been high and the available metrics are not in love with his defense to date. Evaluations of his defensive ability, present and future, are best described as “agnostic”.\n\nFinally, it’s worth noting that Bolte joins a crowded group vying for spots in the A’s outfield in the second half of the 2020’s. Already entrenched, and under contract for several years, are Tyler Soderstrom, Denzel Clarke, and Lawrence Butler, with Colby Thomas trying to establish himself, Junior Perez a true CFer, and Devin Taylor likely to be a fast mover.\n\nBut that’s really an asterisk since there is always room for a star (Bolte’s upside) and never room for a dud (Bolte’s floor). So which is he? Or is the answer somewhere in between and if so closer to which one? Should he be kept and nurtured as a future core piece or should he be dangled as trade bait to a team",

The news comes a day after the Mets’ long-term closer, Edwin Díaz, reached a three-year deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nThe 31-year-old slugger had been unable to find a long-term deal last season and returned to the Mets on a shorter contract, which he opted out of after this year’s World Series. While the Mets were interested in re-signing him they reportedly never made an offer once other teams were willing to offer longer, more valuable deals to the the first baseman.\n\nAlonso has spent his entire MLB career with the Mets, and last season broke Darryl Strawberry’s franchise record for home runs. He ends his Mets career with 264 home runs. He was also incredibly popular with the team’s fans due to his good-nature and power, earning the nickname Polar Bear. The Mets also lost another long-term popular player, Brandon Nimmo, last month in a trade with the Texas Rangers.\n\nAlonso had one of the best offensive seasons of his career in 2025 – he hit .272 with 38 home runs and 126 RBIs – but there are concerns about his defense, a weak point for the Mets, and base running, and the Mets appeared reluctant to give him a multi-year deal when they have already have Juan Soto and Francisco Lindor on expensive, long-term contracts.",

London has missed the last three games due to a knee injury and will miss his fourth after sitting out all three days of practice in Week 15.\n\nThe fourth-year wide receiver has 60 receptions for 810 receiving yards and six touchdowns in nine games played this season. London suffered a PCL strain back in Week 11, the same week that starting quarterback Michael Penix Jr. partially tore his ACL.\n\nWhile London has been ruled out, the Buccaneers are getting star wideout Mike Evans back, head coach Todd Bowles announced on Wednesday. Evans has been out since breaking his collarbone in Week 7. Back in Week 1, the Falcons held Evans to just 51 yards on five receptions.\n\nWithout London in Week 15, the Falcons will look to wide receiver Darnell Mooney and tight end Kyle Pitts to pick up the slack on offense.

    "fullText": "FLORHAM PARK, N.J. (AP) — Brady Cook will take the snaps with the New York Jets' starters at practice Wednesday, opening the possibility the undrafted rookie quarterback could start Sunday at Jacksonville.\n\nCoach Aaron Glenn said neither Tyrod Taylor nor Justin Fields will participate on the field while dealing with injuries, and the team will see how both quarterbacks feel as the week progresses.\n\n“There's a plan for the quarterbacks,” Glenn said. “Either way it works out during the week, we've got all our bases covered.”\n\nTaylor made his third straight start for the benched Fields last Sunday before injuring his groin late in the first quarter of the Jets' 34-10 loss to the Miami Dolphins. Cook, who was Taylor's backup because Fields was ruled out ahead of the game with knee soreness, filled in and went 14 of 30 for 163 yards and two interceptions in his NFL regular-season debut.\n\n“I thought he did a pretty good job,” Glenn said of Cook’s performance. “It was a tough situation for him with Tyrod going down and him not getting all the reps with the first team.”\n\nNew York also signed Adrian Martinez to the practice squad after he was released Tuesday by San Francisco. Martinez, the 2024 UFL MVP and UFL championship game MVP, was with the Jets through training camp this past summer.\n\nCook, who was sacked six times and came up limping slightly at one point in the game against the Dolphins, will be listed on the injury report but Glenn said he'll be fine. The coach was looking forward to Cook getting snaps with the starters Wednesday.\n\n“Man, that does a lot for every quarterback, especially if we're getting him to building continuity with the rest of the guys,” Glenn said.\n\nCook, who threw for 9,008 yards and 49 touchdowns with 15 interceptions in five seasons at Missouri, was signed to the active roster Saturday. He had been promoted from the practice squad for two previous games this season, but hadn’t played in the regular season.\n\nCook was 25 of 38 for 235 yards and a touchdown with one interception in three preseason games.\n\nThe Jets (3-10), who were eliminated from playoff contention for the 15th straight season, are dealing with several other injuries.\n\nGlenn said running back Breece Hall, tight ends Mason Taylor and Stone Smartt, defensive lineman Harrison Phillips, linebackers Quincy Williams and Kiko Mauigoa, and cornerback Azareye'h Thomas won't practice as they deal with various ailments. Glenn added that some of the players are simply being rested.\n\nStar wide receiver Garrett Wilson is eligible to come off injured reserve after sitting four games with a knee injury, but Glenn said he hasn't yet been cleared to practice.\n\nThe Jets signed defensive lineman Eric Watts to the active roster and placed rookie D-lineman Tyler Baron on injured reserve after he hurt a knee against Miami.\n\nTight end Nick Muse, a seventh-round draft pick out of Minnesota in 2022, was signed to the practice squad. He was most recently with the Los Angeles Rams, who released him Tuesday, and also had stints with Philadelphia and Arizona.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "fullText": "Nottingham Forest will look to strengthen their Europa League ambitions with another crucial win as they travel to the Netherlands to face Utrecht, keeping one eye firmly on securing a place in the round of 16.\n\nDespite a turbulent domestic campaign, Sean Dyche’s side remain well positioned to progress in Europe. Forest sit in a promising spot heading into the final group fixtures, though they will still need a result against a Utrecht team who, despite sitting 32nd in the league phase standings, cannot be underestimated.\n\nForest had enjoyed a three-match winning run – scoring three goals in each victory over Leeds, Liverpool and Malmö – but their momentum has stalled since.\n\nA dip in results has dragged them back into a mid-season relegation battle, something the club hoped to avoid following Dyche’s appointment in October.\n\nDays after edging past bottom-placed Wolves, the Tricky Trees fell to a comfortable defeat away at Everton, leaving them 17th in the Premier League and just two points above the relegation zone.\n\nAttention now turns back to the Europa League, where Forest sit two points outside the top seven and four off first place. With the league phase tightly congested, every point against those around them is pivotal.\n\nUtrecht, meanwhile, are competing in European football for the first time in 14 years. They are one of only five teams yet to record a win in this season’s competition, having drawn once and lost four. Their solitary point came against Porto before falling to a fourth defeat against Real Betis on matchweek five.\n\nDomestically, however, Ron Jans’ side has been far more consistent. Just five defeats in 15 league matches have pushed Utrecht into the European positions once again as they look to turn what has been an occasional high into a more regular achievement.\n\nThey enter this match as clear underdogs but will hope to channel their steady league form into a much-needed European lift.\n\nUtrecht will be without midfielder Davy van den Berg, who remains sidelined through injury, while goalkeeper Vasilis Barkas is recovering but could return in time to start. Attacking midfielder Victor Jensen (hamstring) and full-back Niklas Vesterlund (knee) will also miss Thursday’s clash.\n\nFor Nottingham Forest, Dyche remains without full-back Ola Aina, midfielder Douglas Luiz (both thigh) and striker Chris Wood (knee), with all three continuing their rehabilitation. Defender Murillo is facing a race against time to return from a hamstring issue and illness, having missed Forest’s last three matches in all competitions.\n\nUTR: Barkas; Horemans, Van De Hoorn, Viergever, El Karouani; Bozdogan, Ongena, De Wit; Rodriguez, Min, Cathline",

And once again, Rivers will wear No. 17. pic.twitter.com/kEPdI653Oz\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) December 10, 2025\n\nBecause injured starting quarterback Daniel Jones was placed on injured reserve with a season-ending Achilles injury, his #17 is eligible to be recirculated to Rivers for the remainder of the 2025 campaign.\n\nPer NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo, an NFL spokesman indicated that, “The league approved it as it does not present a competitive issue as one player will be wearing that number.”\n\nRivers also texted Jones to ensure the former Colts starting quarterback was okay with him using his legendary #17 again. Rivers was already seen on the Colts practice field during Wednesday’s indoor practice, repping his #17.\n\nIt may not mean much, but Rivers likely would’ve looked weird with another jersey number (and we all know #18 was already unavailable!)\n\nIt’s best to have the 44-year-old quarterback most comfortable resuming his pro career, and it also provides Colts fans who bought a Rivers jersey back in 2020 the opportunity to wear a current one again—without any change to a new jersey number for the remainder of this year.",

    "description": "Philadelphia Eagles coach Nick Sirianni called the notion of benching of Jalen Hurts \"ridiculous,\" when asked about the struggling quarterback.",
    "fullText": "Dec. 10 (UPI) -- Philadelphia Eagles coach Nick Sirianni called the notion of benching of Jalen Hurts \"ridiculous,\" when asked about the struggling quarterback.\n\nSirianni made the comments during his weekly radio appearance on 94 WIP in Philadelphia. He said Hurts is \"absolutely\" the Eagles' Week 15 starter.\n\nHurts threw 16 touchdown passes and just one interception through the Eagles' first 10 games this season, leading to an 8-2 start. He totaled three touchdown passes, five interceptions and two fumbles during the Eagles' active three-game losing streak.\n\nBut Sirianni shut down the idea of moving the quarterback to the bench at any point this season, despite his struggles.\n\n\"No, I think that's ridiculous,\" Sirianni said. \"I know every time I go out on that field with Jalen Hurts as our quarterback, we have a chance to win the game. That's something that's been proven. We've won a lot of football games.\n\n\"This is the most ultimate team game. You win together as a team, you lose together as a team. It's never just one thing.\"\n\nTanner McKee and Sam Howell are the other quarterbacks on the Eagles' roster. Kyle McCord is their practice squad quarterback. Howell has the most experience (18 starts) among the backups.\n\nHurts completed 64.7% of his throws for 2,854 yards, 19 touchdowns and six interceptions through 13 starts this season. He also ran for 337 yards and eight scores.\n\nThe two-time Pro Bowl selection and Super Bowl LIX MVP completed 68.7% of his throws for 2,903 yards, 18 scores and five interceptions last season. He also ran for 630 yards and 14 scores in 2024.\n\nPro Football Focus gave Hurts the eighth-best rating among quarterbacks who played at least 50% of the maximum dropbacks at the position through 14 weeks this season. He also received the eighth-best passing grade. In 2023, the outlet ranked Hurts 18th in offensive rating and 23rd in passing grade.\n\nThe Eagles, who went 14-3 last season to win the NFC East division title before capturing a Lombardi Trophy, sit atop the division again in 2025. They currently hold the No. 3 seed in the NFC.\n\nThe Eagles, who have had a Top-10 rushing attack each year from 2020 through 2024, including a Top-5 unit three times during that span, rank No. 22 in rushing this season. They also rank 22nd defensively, after allowing the fewest yards in the NFL last season.\n\nHurts and the Eagles (8-5) will host the Las Vegas Raiders (2-11) at 1 p.m. EST Sunday in Philadelphia.",

    "fullText": "Pep Guardiola has selected an unchanged side for the Champions League clash with Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu.\n\nThe City boss goes with the same starting line-up that beat Sunderland 3-0 on Saturday in the Premier League.\n\nGET YOUR TICKETS FOR CITY V BRENTFORD\n\nVictory in game six of the league stage would see us move into the top-eight in the Champions League table as we aim to get one of the top spots to avoid the play-offs.\n\nCity travelled to Spain with a 21-man squad with Rodri, Mateo Kovacic and John Stones unavailable due to injury.\n\nREAL MADRID XI: Courtois, Valverde (C), Asencio, Rudiger, Carreras, Tchouameni, Ceballos, Bellingham, Rodrygo, Gonzalo, Vinicius\n\nSubs: Lunin, Fran Gonzalez, Endrick, Mbappe, Guler, Fran Garcia, Brahim, Cestero, Mastantuono, Martinez, Valdepenos\n\nCITY XI: Donnarumma, Nunes, Dias, Gvardiol, O’Reilly, Nico, Bernardo (C), Foden, Cherki, Doku, Haaland\n\nSubs: Trafford, Bettinelli, Reijnders, Ake, Marmoush, Ait-Nouri, Savinho, Khusanov, Bobb, Lewis\n\nCity are in the winning habit, with three victories on the bounce so Pep has stuck with a successful formula.\n\nThat should see Nico O’Reilly and Matheus Nunes as our full-backs either side of Ruben Dias and Josko Gvardiol.\n\nNico will playing in the holding midfield role with captain and Bernardo Silva and Phil Foden close by.\n\nErling Haaland will again lead the attack with Rayan Cherki and Jeremy Doku offering plenty of threat going forward for the Blues.\n\nIf this feels like a regular fixture, that’s because tonight’s clash will be the 15th time we’ve met since the 2012/13 season, making it the most-played Champions League game during that time.\n\nThat probably reflects our positions as the most successful teams in Spain and England in recent years and even with the familiarity, it certainly hasn’t bred contempt, with the encounter as mouthwatering as ever.\n\nThis will be the fifth successive season that we visit the Santiago Bernabeu with two draws and two defeats in our last four trips and our last win there in February 2020 so a win is due.\n\nCity go into tonight’s match sitting 12th in the Champions League standings and a victory in the Spanish capital would move us into the top eight and therefore avoid the play-offs for the round of 16.\n\nThe new format means those games can present a real pot luck of an opponent; last season we had the tricky task of facing tonight’s opponents who are also the record winners of the trophy.\n\nAhead of tonight’s game, the table shows we would currently face either Italian champions Napoli or Azerbaijani side Qarabag, so it’s a game to be avoided if possible.\n\nThis will be the 15th time that Real Madrid and City have faced each other in the Champions League. Since their first meeting in the 2012/13 season, it is already the most-played fixture in the competition in this period (14 games).\n\nCity have lost our last two games against Real Madrid, suffering defeats home and away against them in last season’s play-off round. This is as many losses as we had experienced in our previous 11 games against the Spanish side combined.\n\nPep Guardiola has faced Real Madrid on 27 previous occasions, winning 48% of those matches and only lost one of his first nine away games. However, he is winless in the most recent four against the Spanish side and has never gone five in succession without beating them.\n\nThis will be the first managerial meeting between Xabi Alonso and Guardiola. Alonso made 79 appearances in his playing career under Guardiola, all for Bayern Munich between August 2014 and May 2016.\n\nSince November 2024, City have lost six of our 12 games in the Champions League. Prior to this run of 12, their previous six defeats in the competition came over the course of 69 matches, between October 2018 and October 2024.\n\nReal Madrid are currently on the third-longest streak of scoring in consecutive home games in European Cup/Champions League history (38 games), behind a 44-game run by Real Madrid themselves (September 2011-October 2018) and one of 45 games by Juventus (April 1973-September 2000). The last visiting side to keep a clean sheet away to Real Madrid in this competition was CSKA Moscow in December 2018 (0-0 draw).\n\nKylian Mbappe has scored nine goals in five games in the Champions League this season; the joint-most by a Real Madrid player in their first five appearances in a single edition, along with Cristiano Ronaldo in 2013-14 (9).\n\nErling Haaland has scored more goals in the Champions League than any other player since his debut campaign in 2019/20 (54). Indeed, two of the only three players who have netted 50+ goals in the competition in this period could both square off in this match, with Real Madrid’s Mbappe also netting 50 times since then (Robert Lewandowski being the other).\n\nMbappe has been directly involved in eight goals in seven games against City in the UEFA Champions League (seven goals, one assist); only Lionel Messi has had a hand in more against us in the competition - nine in eight appearances.",

    "fullText": "Coding agents are great at lots of things, but some bugs consistently stump them. That's why we're introducing Debug Mode, an entirely new agent loop built around runtime information and human verification.\n\nTo build it, we examined the practices of the best debuggers on our team. We rolled their workflows into an agent mode, equipping it with tools to instrument code with runtime logs, prompts that generate multiple hypotheses about what's going wrong, and the ability to call back to you to reproduce the issue and verify fixes.\n\nThe result is an interactive process that reliably fixes bugs that were previously beyond the reach of even the smartest models working alone, or could take significant developer time to address.\n\nTo get started, select Debug Mode from the dropdown menu and describe the bug in as much detail as you can.\n\nInstead of immediately trying to generate a fix, the agent reads through your codebase and generates multiple hypotheses about what could be wrong. Some will be ideas you would have thought of on your own, but others will likely be approaches you wouldn't have considered.\n\nThe agent then instruments your code with logging statements designed to test these hypotheses. This prepares the agent to receive concrete data about what's actually happening when the bug occurs.\n\nNext, go to your application and reproduce the bug while the agent collects the runtime logs.\n\nThe agent can see exactly what's happening in your code when the bug occurs: variable states, execution paths, timing information. With this data, it can pinpoint the root cause and generate a targeted fix. Often that's a precise two or three line modification instead of the hundreds of lines of speculative code you'd have received with a standard agent interaction.\n\nAt this point, Debug Mode asks you to reproduce the bug one more time with the proposed fix in place. If the bug is gone, you mark it as fixed and the agent removes all the instrumentation, leaving you with a clean, minimal change you can ship.\n\nThis human-in-the-loop verification is critical. Sometimes bugs are obvious, but other times they fall into a gray area where the fix might work technically but not feel right. The agent can't make that call on its own. If you don't think the bug is fixed, the agent adds more logging, you reproduce again, and it refines its approach until the problem is actually solved.\n\nThis kind of tight back-and-forth is one way we think AI coding works best. The agent handles the tedious work while you make the quick decisions that need human judgment. The result with Debug Mode is that tricky bugs that used to be out of reach are now reliably fixed.\n\nRead the Debug Mode docs. Learn about all the new features in Cursor 2.2.",

    "fullText": "Authoritarian governments don’t like their citizens being able to have private conversations using end-to-end encrypted messaging apps. This is the reason Russia has just banned FaceTime, but it was surprising iMessage had escaped a ban.\n\nA potential reason for this has now been discovered: Apple may have accidentally made it almost impossible for a government to ban its end-to-end encrypted text messaging app …\n\nRussia last week blocked the use of FaceTime within the country, naturally using terrorism as the excuse.\n\nJustifying its decision, the communications regulator, Roskomnadzor, said in an emailed statement: “According to law enforcement agencies, FaceTime is being used to organise and carry out terrorist attacks in the country, recruit perpetrators, and commit fraud and other crimes against Russian citizens.” The watchdog did not cite evidence in support of the allegations.\n\nFaceTime uses end-to-end encryption (E2EE), so audio and video calls cannot be intercepted by the state. However, some were curious why Russia hadn’t done the same with iMessage, which is similarly protected by E2EE.\n\nOne potential explanation offered is that iMessage usage within the country is extremely low, with most people preferring other messaging apps. Now, however, another possible explanation has surfaced.\n\nWhen Apple commenter John Gruber wondered aloud about this, Mastodon user Magebarf had an idea.\n\nIsn’t it still that the iMessage traffic is merged on the same endpoint as the push notifications? So, if taking out iMessage all remote push notifications to iPhone would immediately cease to work.\n\nThey suggested this was a deliberate decision by Apple, but the aim was to ensure carriers, rather than repressive governments, couldn’t block iMessage. Carriers might otherwise have been tempted to do so as the service reduced demand for SMS, which attracted per-message charges at the time.\n\nThis is how they shoehorned in iMessage under the nose of all phone operators, who already had been using the push notifications as one of the the major reasons for their customers to get a iPhone, and now they couldn’t block the iMessage traffic.\n\nAs evidence for this, they noted that choosing the messaging-only tier on in-flight Wi-Fi services means you continue to get push notifications for other apps you can’t actually access.\n\nSince FaceTime also relies on the Apple Push Notification service (APNs), it’s not 100% clear whether this is indeed the explanation. There are also other methods a government could use to block iMessage, such as blocking access to Identity Services, though this may be tougher to implement across an entire country.\n\nHowever, it does seem to be at least plausible and if accurate would explain an otherwise surprising decision.\n\nOf course, assuming it was an accidental side benefit of a policy targeting carriers is also speculation. It may well be that Apple had in mind also protecting against repressive governments, although in that case you might have expected it to similarly protect FaceTime.\n\nBenjamin Mayo contributed to this report\n\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

    "fullText": "Independent newsletters are one of my favorite parts of the internet. They're a way to explore niche interests and connect with like-minded people around the world.\n\nWhile the internet is useful for discovering content, it’s not always a good way to consume it. Email inboxes have become a tragedy of the commons - a communal to-do list, even in the most organized cases. When I'm in the mood to read newsletters, I don't want the frenetic energy of my email inbox. I also believe the growth of independent newsletters is being limited by the cultural stagnation around email use.\n\nLast month, I published the post Snail mail exploring the idea of blog posts as paper letters. I imagined taking a stack of envelopes to a café on the weekend and working through them without distraction. The post seemed to resonate - many people responded positively.\n\nAfter mulling over the idea during my vacation, I came back and built it.\n\nToday I'm introducing the print edition of Contraption posts. Subscribers receive all essays on this site, including Workshop, as printed letters - arriving about once per week.\n\nI built the letter delivery system using Lob, which turns letter-sending into a simple API. I connected this blog to Lob with a bit of code, and I use Stripe to manage subscriptions and shipping information.\n\nPrinting and sending physical mail costs money, so the print edition is paid. But my intention is not to start members-only posts - I think of this more as an “unlocking the commons” model inspired by Craig Mod. If you like my projects and writing, this is a way to help create more of it. (As a perk, print subscribers receive a free Postcard premium subscription.)\n\nI’m excited to share this today. I just passed the third anniversary of publishing on this website, and it’s been rewarding to see it evolve and grow over time. Like all things here, this is an experiment, and I hope to use it to steer future projects.\n\nIf you’d like a fun reason to check your physical mailbox, consider subscribing to the print edition of Contraption Company.",

    "fullText": "Singapore is a ghost town in Michigan, United States. It was a casualty of erosion after the surrounding woods were deforested—exacerbated by the need for lumber to rebuild several Midwestern cities and towns ravaged by fires in 1871. Its ruins are now buried beneath the sand dunes of the Lake Michigan shoreline at the mouth of the Kalamazoo River in Saugatuck Township, near the cities of Saugatuck and Douglas in Allegan County.\n\nIt was founded in 1836 by New York land speculator Oshea Wilder, who hoped to build a port town to rival Chicago and Milwaukee.[1] At its height, the town boasted three mills, two hotels, several general stores, and a bank and was home to Michigan's first schoolhouse. In total, the town consisted of 23 buildings and two sawmills.[2]\n\nIn 1838, two short-lived \"wildcat\" banks were established in Allegan County: the Bank of Allegan and the Bank of Singapore.[3] Both issued their own banknotes and were required to hold enough hard currency (specie) to cover at least one-third of the circulating banknotes. However, neither Singapore nor Allegan was at that level.\n\nOccasionally, collectors come across notes issued by the Bank of Singapore. There are a few known full sheets before they were cut into individual notes, sometimes signed and sometimes unsigned by the bank president or authorized personnel at the time.[4]\n\nThe 40-Day Blizzard of 1842 might have wiped out the people of Singapore had it not been for the shipwreck of the Milwaukie, laden with barrelled flour, just off its shore. Several barrels washed ashore and fed the people of Singapore until the blizzard blew over.[5]\n\nWilder deserted the town in 1846, moving back to Calhoun County. James Carter of New York bought out Wilder's interest in the town and moved there to oversee his investment. It was only two years after that that Carter sold the town to his brother, Artemas, and Francis B. Stockbridge.[6] Artemas was more innovative than his brother, and very soon after arriving, he and Stockbridge built the first three-masted schooner on Lake Michigan, dubbed the Octavia, to carry lumber from Singapore to Chicago.[7] Carter was bought out by Stockbridge in 1850, and the decade proved to be one of prosperity for Stockbridge and the town,[6] which boasted a population of several hundred people by 1871.\n\nAfter fires swept through Chicago, Holland, Peshtigo, and Manistee and Muskegon Michigan in late 1871, the area around Singapore was almost completely deforested to supply lumber for rebuilding. Without a protective tree cover, the winds and sands blowing off Lake Michigan quickly eroded the town into ruins and, within four years, completely covered it.[8] The town was vacated by 1875.\n\nToday, Singapore lives on only in the name of the Singapore Yacht Club at one end of town. Just as the \"cow kicking over the lantern\" story was born out of the Great Chicago Fire, this event also gave birth to a legend. The story persists that one resident of Singapore refused to move, even as the sand enveloped his home. Eventually, he had to enter and leave the dwelling by a second-floor window, and he stayed until the sand reached the roof.[8]\n\nThe story of the rise and demise of Singapore, Michigan was quoted by Singaporean Prime Minister Lawrence Wong in his maiden National Day Rally speech on 18 August 2024, while he was an alumnus of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.[9]\n\n42°40′39″N 86°12′20″W﻿ / ﻿42.67750°N 86.20556°W﻿ / 42.67750; -86.20556",

    "description": "Selling my house and moving cross-country to live with my parents has been good for my kid, her grandparents, and my finances, but I'm struggling.",
    "fullText": "I always knew selling our house in Washington and moving across the country to live with my parents in Maryland was not my dream.\n\nHowever, the practical side of me thought it might at least be a good idea.\n\nFor several years, my partner and I had been struggling with the high cost of living in Western Washington. And, like many millennials, I've struggled to juggle parenting, work, and a social life.\n\nAs much as we loved Washington and the friends and family members we had there, we decided to take a risk and pursue a different life across the country.\n\nI spent months hawking our things on Facebook Marketplace and our local \"Buy Nothing\" group. We sold our house, said goodbye to our community, and crammed the rest of our belongings into a truck and a small U-Haul.\n\nOne week and many hours of driving later, we pulled up to my childhood home and moved in.\n\nLiving with my parents in Maryland has come with a lot of clear benefits.\n\nMy daughter gets to have rich involvement with a lot of our adult relatives, including daily interactions with her grandparents. I get support from nearby family members who can often provide care for her when I need it.\n\nMy partner and I no longer have a mortgage to cover or any of the other expenses that come with owning a home. We have a community style of living that means shared responsibilities for things like making dinner and taking care of household costs.\n\nDespite the support and financial benefits, there are many things I miss since moving. I've thought of Washington as its own \"person\" in my story to mourn losing.\n\nI fell in love with our slice of the state, a small walkable city right on the Puget Sound. I treasured the environment where we lived — full of rich outdoor adventures, moody weather moments, magical sunny days when they came, and the best coffee culture.\n\nWe left behind a small but mighty community, and moving back home meant starting over.\n\nA year later, I'm still working to make deep connections, and I have many days when I feel lonely.\n\nThe last time I lived in Maryland was more than 10 years ago, so I didn't have a group of friends here waiting for me. I've had to dive into building a community from scratch, which can take a lot of time.\n\nThough I grew up in Maryland, it still doesn't feel like home as much as Washington did.\n\nI know we're in the right place for us right now, but I can't help but wonder about the life I left behind. Were the higher costs of living worth it? Should I trade this newfound financial stability for a scrappier, penny-pinching life with a fuller heart?\n\nPerhaps finding community and falling in love with the place I live now just takes more time than I'm willing to give at the moment.\n\nEither way, for now, I'm embracing the financial stability and family support this move has given me, even as I continue to miss our life in Washington.\n\nMaybe the real lesson is that financial decisions can't be measured in dollars alone — and sometimes the biggest cost is what you give up.",

    "description": "See which staffers in Trump's White House quietly earn up to $225,700, including top advisors and counsel, as revealed in the latest salary report.",
    "fullText": "Working at the White House might be one of the most exclusive and prestigious jobs in America, but you'd be surprised by how much some of the people around the president make each year.\n\nFor starters, having the top job — that is, being the president of the United States — brings in a salary of $400,000, which some independently wealthy presidents, such as John F. Kennedy, Herbert Hoover, and Donald Trump, have chosen to donate instead.\n\nWhile the figure is significantly higher than what the average American makes — $69,846 in 2024, according to the Social Security Administration — it's also less than you would need to be in the top 1% of earners across all US states.\n\nIn 2025, the top 1% of earners in Maryland and Virginia, which border the District of Columbia, make an annual $677,543 and $701,792, respectively.\n\nGovernment salaries can often fall behind what professionals make in the private sector, as serving the public isn't quite as lucrative as maximizing shareholder value. Still, to say that those working at the White House are underpaid would be an overstatement.\n\nOn July 1, the White House shared with Congress the salaries of all employees inside the president's executive office, including aides, advisors, and staff leaders, as it is legally required to.\n\nSome of the highest-compensated workers around the president include policy advisors and legal counsel, while others are responsible for the president's communications and personnel management. Lower-paid roles include research assistants and press assistants.\n\nA few at the top of the White House's payroll at the time of the list's reporting to Congress have since left their roles, like Taylor Budowich, who went to work for the private sector, or moved around the government, like Mike Waltz, who began acting as the US ambassador to the United Nations after being dismissed from his role as national security advisor.\n\nOther notable names, like Marco Rubio and David Sacks, declared a $0 salary from the office of the president due to either forgoing their salary or receiving compensation from other branches of government.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSee the 35 people who get paid the most inside the White House, after the president himself.\n\nRole: Senior immigration advisor\n\nKlopp, who earns the maximum salary possible in the senior executive service, is a top advisor to border czar Tom Homan and has worked in the government for over 17 years, including roles at the Department of Homeland Security and in Immigration and Customs Enforcement's enforcement and removal operations, Fortune reported.\n\nAccording to Mkrtchian's LinkedIn profile, the attorney began working as an advisor for the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission in June 2024.\n\nRole: Deputy chief of staff for legislative, political, and public affairs\n\nRole: Deputy chief of staff for communications and public liaison and cabinet secretary\n\nBudowich left his role at the White House to work in the private sector in October. Neither Budowich nor the White House commented publicly on his departure.\n\nIn February, he was named in a lawsuit by the Associated Press over his move to block the outlet's access to the Oval Office and Air Force One after they refused to adopt Trump's naming of the Gulf of America.\n\nIn response, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, who was also named in the lawsuit, said, \"We feel we are in the right in this position. We're going to ensure that truth and accuracy is present at that White House every single day.\"\n\nRole: Director of communications\n\nRole: Deputy assistant to the president and deputy special envoy to Ukraine\n\nRole: Special assistant to the president and deputy executive director of the National Energy Dominance Council\n\nIn October, Doffermyre began serving as the solicitor for the US Department of the Interior after being a senior advisor to the president for the first months of his second presidency.\n\nRole: Director of the Office of Management and Administration\n\nRole: Director of the Office of Presidential Personnel\n\nIn August, the president nominated Gor, who was then serving as the director of the Office of Presidential Personnel, as the US ambassador to India, and he was sworn into the role in November.\n\nRole: Director of the Domestic Policy Council\n\nRole: Chief of staff to the first lady\n\nRole: Deputy chief of staff for operations\n\nRole: Assistant to the president for economic policy and director of the National Economic Council\n\nRole: Special envoy for Ukraine and Russia\n\nRole: Senior advisor and senior director of power at the National Energy Dominance Council\n\nRole: White House press secretary\n\nRole: Deputy chief of staff for strategic implementation\n\nIn July, Matthews was sworn in as general counsel of the Department of War after serving as senior associate counsel to the president during the first months of his second term.\n\nRole: Deputy chief of staff for policy and Homeland Security advisor\n\nRole: Senior counselor for trade and manufacturing\n\nAfter Sergio Gor was confirmed as the US ambassador to India in October, Deputy Chief of Staff Dan Scavino took over as the White House's director of personnel.\n\nRole: National security advisor\n\nAfter the leak of Signal chats discussing US strikes in Yemen, the national security advisor was dismissed from his role and announced as the 32nd United States ambassador to the United Nations, a role he assumed in September.\n\nRole: Deputy director of the Presidential Council of Advisors for Digital Assets\n\nRole: Director of speechwriting",

    "title": "US Navy secretary hopes new Friday office hours can prevent another frigate fiasco",
    "description": "The office hours are part of Secretary Phelan's plan to avoid the problems that led to the cancellation of the Constellation-class frigate.",
    "fullText": "The US Navy secretary says he is going to be personally stepping into the shipbuilding process, setting up Friday office hours for any design changes to a new landing ship project.\n\nThe oversight is an attempt to avoid repeating mistakes that led to program-crippling cost overruns and delays for the Navy's Constellation-class frigate, which was recently canceled with only two vessels under construction.\n\nJohn Phelan, the sea service secretary, announced his plan last week at a Reagan National Defense Forum event when asked how the Navy plans to avoid missteps that led to the end of the Constellation program as the service builds the new LSM Landing Ship.\n\n\"We have settled on a design, it's a well known ship. The requirements are going to be put in and done before we start building the first one,\" Phelan said, adding that \"when we start building the first one, any change order will have to be put through me,\" the secretary added, and \"I've reserved Friday at 5 p.m. for my change order meeting schedule.\"\n\nThe Navy announced the selection of Dutch-designed vessel, the LST 100 landing ship, as the pick for the new medium landing ship program last week.\n\n\"By leveraging a mature, non-developmental design and strategic engineering,\" Naval Sea Systems Command said, \"we are shortening acquisition timelines and ensuring our forces have the littoral mobility they need when they need it.\"\n\nMarine Corps Commandant Eric Smith said that the Dutch shipbuilder Damen's LST 100, which displaces about 4,000 tons and can carry cargo and helicopters, is \"an excellent choice\" for the Marines.\n\n\"The Medium Landing Ships will enable our Marines to be more agile and flexible in austere environments where there are no ports, providing the joint force the needed operational mobility within the adversary's weapons engagement zone,\" he added.\n\nLike the Constellation, which was based on Italian navy frigates, the LSM comes with a preconceived design. But the Navy decided to build the first Constellation vessel before the design was set, leading to cost and delivery problems. Now, the service is only building two of them; it originally awarded Wisconsin-based Fincantieri Marinette Marine $22 billion for 20.\n\nPhelan posted about the plan for the new landing ship on social media, writing that \"any change order comes through me.\"\n\nHe said \"we are going to take our warfighters' requirements, translate them into stable, producible designs, and stick with them once they're set,\" adding that \"if anyone wants to tinker with them, I've reserved Fridays at 5pm in my office for change order decisions — no drift, no delay.\"\n\nThe secretary's oversight plan puts him more directly in control of the LSM's design.\n\nThe Navy secretary's role is broad and policy-driven, centered on budgets, procurement, and shipbuilding programs. The specifics of fleet strategy and ship configuration typically fall to the chief of naval operations and NAVSEA, though the secretary still influences the fleet through major acquisition and funding decisions.\n\nPhelan, who comes from a background in business, has previously stressed the need for more oversight of shipbuilding projects. Now he's taking that on himself.\n\n\"Secretary Phelan's decision to personally engage in the change order process is a necessary first step,\" Thomas Modly, a former Navy secretary during the first Trump administration, told Business Insider. \"That being said, that decision is not an institutional change, just a personal one.\"\n\n\"The Navy itself needs to demonstrate that it can adopt its thinking to accept the concept of minimally altered foreign ship designs, and the programs need long-tenured program managers who believe in it,\" he said. \"That's a harder problem.\"\n\nPhelan's plan needs to establish successful oversight into the Navy's future as well. \"Any fixes in this regard must outlive Secretary Phelan's tenure, or we will be looking at the same issues again in the future,\" Modly added. \"Also, I hope the secretary is prepared to say 'no' a lot more than he says 'yes.'\"\n\nUnder the second Trump administration, senior leadership, like Phelan, has made tackling key long-standing shipbuilding problems a priority, focusing on clearer designs and requirements as well as staying on budget and on schedule. Many of these issues stretch back decades and have been compounded by a shrinking workforce, stagnant wages, and aging shipyards that rely on outdated technology and practices.\n\nWhen Phelan recently announced the cancellation of the Frigate on X, he said the vessel no longer offered strategic value to the fleet.\n\nAlthough the acquisition of this vessel was important to the service's vision of a 355-ship fleet, the secretary said ending the program would help meet \"the need to grow the fleet faster to meet tomorrow's threats\" as the service prioritizes other classes of ships for faster shipbuilding timelines.\n\nOther lines of effort for the Navy include uncrewed autonomous vessels, and there are reports of a \"Golden Fleet\" plan that seemingly concerns the development of hypersonic missile carriers. Where such projects fit into fleet design planning remains to be seen.\n\nPhelan, like other service secretaries, has been keen on doing business with new partners alongside traditional defense companies.\n\n\"The Navy's going to be a better customer,\" the secretary said at the recent security forum, \"But it's going to become a smarter customer,\" he added. \"I think we are going to try to become a better partner with industry and new players as well.\"",

    "description": "Vertical Aerospace unveiled its new eVTOL, with controls inspired by the F-35 that make it easier to hover. Its first routes are planned for 2029.",
    "fullText": "Vertical Aerospace has unveiled its new flying taxi, Valo.\n\nAhead of its big reveal on Wednesday, I was one of the first people to get a look at the aircraft.\n\nFlying taxis are officially called electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft, or eVTOLs.\n\nThe starting use case is that they can significantly reduce commute times between airports and city centers. Plus, they're quieter and less polluting than helicopters.\n\nFor example, Vertical says it would take 12 minutes between Canary Wharf and London Heathrow Airport, compared to over an hour via public transit or car.\n\nHowever, its planned network also includes regional links between significant English cities, which it hopes could boost growth.\n\nValo could also be operated for emergency medical services and cargo missions, while Vertical is planning a future hybrid version with autonomous capabilities.\n\nIt's aiming for regulatory approval from the UK's Civil Aviation Authority in 2028.\n\n\"Valo sets a new standard — bigger, safer and more capable than anything in the sector,\" said Vertical's chair, Dómhnal Slattery. \"It's a breakthrough for aviation and a clear sign of the UK's leadership in aerospace.\"\n\nHere's what it looks like inside Valo, and how it's also using design ideas from fighter jets.\n\nCanary Wharf is one of London's two primary financial districts, alongside the historic City of London. It was built on old docklands, and JPMorgan Chase recently announced plans for a new tower there.\n\nI got a look at the aircraft at the same time as numerous Vertical customers, which include American Airlines, Japan Airlines, and the helicopter operator Bristow.\n\nValo can reach speeds of up to 150 miles per hour. The firm aims to produce 175 units a year by 2030, ramping up to over 225 units annually.\n\nVertical is positioning itself as an original equipment manufacturer, or OEM — the same sort of role as Airbus and Boeing.\n\nMeanwhile, competitors like Archer Aviation are working on operational plans as well, which include setting their own ticket prices and planning apps for hailing aircraft.\n\nVertical is working with Skyports and Bristow on this network. The former builds infrastructure, known as vertiports — similar to helipads but with facilities for passengers and aircraft charging. Bristow specializes in operating civilian helicopters.\n\nA notable aspect of this network is its planned connections to Oxford and Cambridge. Transport links to the two cities, given their strength in academia and burgeoning startups, are seen as key to helping boost economic growth in the UK.\n\nMichael Cervenka, Vertical's chief commercial and strategy officer, compared it to the TARDIS from \"Doctor Who,\" which is famous for being much bigger on the inside than from the outside.\n\nIt was indeed surprising to see suitcase after Rimowa suitcase pulled out — 12 altogether.\n\nEVTOL manufacturers are building a new type of aircraft, so safety is paramount as they work toward certification. They're aiming to achieve the highest standard, which is also used for commercial airliners. This is referred to as 10-9, meaning one catastrophic failure in a billion flight hours.\n\nHaving several propellers and flaps means that if one of them stops working, the aircraft can still fly.\n\nTilting propellers also provide the pilot with more control.\n\n\"We can do something you would really struggle to do in any other tilt rotor or helicopter,\" Cervenka said. \"We can take off, we can hover one meter above the ground, or less, and we can do a 360-degree turn in gusting winds with the aircraft staying very stable.\"\n\nThis model was arranged with four seats, but there's also room for another two.\n\nWhile Archer and Joby's passenger seats are all forward-facing, this arrangement felt more futuristic.\n\nValo has a divider between the cabin and cockpit, and the pilot can talk to passengers via a speaker. In addition to privacy, this physical barrier enhances safety as nobody can interfere with the controls.\n\n\"Here, one of the really important things for us was: Yes, this starts with a premium service, but you don't know who you're getting into the aircraft with,\" Cervenka said.",

    "fullText": "Even though I'm a registered dietitian, the question \"What's for dinner?\" always weighs heavily on my mind.\n\nGetting a decent dinner on the table quickly can be a challenge, particularly when I factor in late work meetings and my two kids' after-school activities.\n\nNo matter how busy I get, though, I always try to prepare a balanced, nutritious dinner with a high-quality protein and at least one vegetable for my family.\n\nHere are seven products I get at Costco to prep flavorful weeknight dinners I feel good about serving my kids.\n\nAmylu chicken meatballs are a versatile option for a weeknight meal, packing about 3 ½ grams of protein per meatball.\n\nI can prepare them on their own or pair them with sides like brown rice and veggies. I've also served them over pasta, zoodles, or crusty bread for a filling weeknight dinner.\n\nThese meatballs reheat well and don't require any time-intensive chopping or prep. They're also great for nights when my kids need something quick and satiating before rushing out the door.\n\nI keep at least one pack in the freezer for backup dinners. They're reliable, kid-friendly, and take all the pressure off when I need something quick.\n\nA good jar of marinara sauce can actually taste homemade, and Rao's version is proof. I can't beat its quality for the price, so I stock up on it whenever I see it at Costco.\n\nI like that it has no added sugar (unlike many jarred marinara sauces). The flavor is also rich enough that I can use it without adding any spices or seasonings.\n\nI often pair this marinara with the Amylu chicken meatballs and spaghetti, but I can also use it in my baked chicken recipe or as a quick pizza sauce.\n\nIt's one of the few items in my pantry that consistently saves me time while still tasting fresh and flavorful.\n\nCostco offers a wide range of heat-and-serve protein options. Kevin's Natural Foods' roasted-garlic chicken is always a staple in our fridge, serving up 21 grams of protein per 5-ounce serving.\n\nI find that each package lasts a long time, so I always keep one on hand for a quick weeknight meal. It's easy to pair with my veggies and other sides of choice.\n\nMy husband loves beef, but I sometimes have trouble preparing it just the way he likes.\n\nThankfully, Cuisine Solutions' sliced grass-fed beef sirloin comes fully cooked and feels impossible to mess up.\n\nIt has 19 grams of protein per 3-ounce serving, and is versatile enough to add to dishes like tacos, salads, or soups.\n\nMy kids prefer their vegetables raw rather than cooked, so a cucumber and tomato salad is a staple side dish on weeknights. Every time I put a batch on the table, my family finishes it.\n\nA three-pack of cucumbers from Costco lasts me the whole week, and I feel good about serving them to my family since they're a source of fiber and vitamin K, which supports bone health.\n\nThe store also tends to sell a wide variety of tomatoes, which I use to add a dose of immunity-boosting vitamin C to the salad.\n\nMy tomato and cucumber salad is so easy to throw together. Just chop some cucumbers and halve the tomatoes. Then, mix them with a drizzle of olive oil, salt, and vinegar.\n\nIf the week is especially busy, everyone is ravenous, and I have to get dinner on the table in less than 10 minutes, I have premade soups, like the Kirkland Signature chicken-tortilla soup, on standby.\n\nAdmittedly, some soups have more sodium than I prefer, but at least the Kirkland Signature chicken-tortilla soup also contains tomatoes, corn, and peppers — and 12 grams of protein per cup.\n\nIt's a nourishing, cozy meal that keeps everyone's bellies full.",

The city is famous for its grand palaces, and come winter, it's dotted with incredible Christmas markets.\n\nOne of my favorites is the Advent Basilica Market, which pulls you in like a magnet with colorful stalls, a towering Christmas tree, and a light show every 30 minutes — all in front of St. Stephen's Basilica.\n\nThe market is filled with so many amazing scents, from the lavender goods and crafts made on the peninsula of Tihany to the paprika Hungary is famous for — it's even in soap.\n\nFor a truly local experience, hop across the river to ice skate at the Advent in Óbuda market, located about 20 minutes from the Basilica on public transport.\n\nWhile you're in the city, I recommend trying kürtőskalács, which you can watch vendors make at all of the major markets.\n\nTranslated as \"chimney cake,\" this spiral of dough is cooked over hot coals before being rolled in toppings, such as sugar, cocoa, or cinnamon (to name a few). When it's fresh off the coals, steam rises from the center of the pastry, resembling a smoking chimney.\n\nI first fell in love with Danish Christmas markets when I studied in Copenhagen for a semester, delighted by how they brought warmth to the darkness of Scandinavian winters.\n\nThe Nyhavn Christmas Market is located on the banks of the canal, with the colorfully painted buildings decorated with lights and julehjerter (Christmas hearts).\n\nI loved that the market was in one of Copenhagen's most iconic areas — it felt like celebrating Christmas in a postcard.\n\nFor a unique holiday experience, visit Tivoli Gardens, the second-oldest amusement park in the world. The already whimsical theme park is covered in Christmas decorations this time of year, plus there's ice skating and a traditional market for visitors to explore.\n\nDon't forget to stop for a ride or two, and try Æbleskiver from one of the market stands. These fluffy, pancake-like balls, dusted in powdered sugar, are so easy to eat, especially with a side of gløgg (mulled wine) to keep you warm.\n\nSituated on the shores of Lake Geneva is the Christmas market Noël au Quai. To get a great view of the Jet d'Eau (an iconic fountain in the lake), hop onto the market's Ferris wheel, then stroll between chalets filled with crafts, gifts, and food.\n\nOne thing I love about Swiss Christmas market food is the dedication to cheese. As soon as I saw a stall selling Chäsbängel — a hollowed-out baguette filled with melted cheese — I knew I had to have it.\n\nI also enjoyed raclette, another melted cheese that pairs well with potatoes, pickles, and more, and absolutely hits the spot on a cold winter's day.\n\nOh, and it's also a great opportunity to try famous Swiss chocolate.\n\nVienna is home to some of the most storied Christmas markets in Europe.\n\nMy favorite — and arguably the city's most famous — is the sprawling market at the Rathausplatz (City Hall), which has a whimsical carousel and towering displays of keepsake ornaments.\n\nI also suggest stopping by Stephansplatz Market, located in the city center, wrapping around the famous St. Stephen's Cathedral.\n\nIt's so cool to stand around the small tables in the shadow of such a Gothic masterpiece, keeping your hands warm by wrapping them around a mug of glühwein (mulled wine). Plus, for a few extra Euros, you can buy a keepsake mug to take home with you.\n\nLuckily, with just a 20-minute train ride between Bruges and Ghent, it's easy to visit both cities' markets in a day. Plus, both are about an hour from Brussels, too, making them good options for a day trip from the capital.\n\nThe red brick building facades and cobblestone streets of Bruges make the city look like something straight from a fairytale.\n\nBeyond the official markets, I loved window shopping among the seemingly endless chocolate shops, dressed with holiday decor and piles of handmade bonbons.\n\nAnd in Ghent, the markets are scattered throughout the small city, offering visitors ample opportunity to stroll around and admire the medieval architecture all dressed up for the festive season.\n\nWhile you're at the markets, make sure to grab a cone of piping-hot, crispy frites (fries) and a side of rich Belgian mayonnaise for dipping.",

    "title": "The Fed is expected to cut interest rates today. Here's why bond yields are moving in the opposite direction.",
    "description": "Investors expect the Fed to cut rates on Wednesday and keep cutting in 2026, but bond yields are hinting at deeper uncertainty ahead for markets.",
    "fullText": "Markets think a rate cut on Wednesday is nearly a foregone conclusion, but bond yields are doing something strange.\n\nDespite a cut being priced in for weeks, US government bonds have been selling off, driving yields higher. The 10-year Treasury yield has jumped by about 20 basis points from its low in November, hovering around 4.20%. on Wednesday.\n\nIt's a reminder that long-term bond yields and the Fed's short-term borrowing rate do not move in lockstep, but it's still an unusual move given predictions for rates to keep coming down in 2026.\n\nThere are a few things that help explain the move.\n\nFront and center for bond investors is the inflation outlook, and it's murky, to say the least.\n\nWhile price growth has cooled in the US since peaking around 9% in the summer of 2022, inflation has crept back up in recent months.\n\nIf the Fed cuts interest rates too quickly, that could stoke fresh inflation. That concern has grown even more pressing to investors in recent weeks as President Donald Trump is expected to announce his pick for the next Fed Chair.\n\nKevin Hassett, a Trump ally who has long supported the president's view that interest rates should be significantly lower, has emerged as the top candidate in recent weeks.\n\n\"The biggest thing happening in the background is the question of who will lead the Fed,\" Christian Hoffmann, the head of fixed income at Thornburg Investment Management, said, pointing to Hassett's potential influence over the market's monetary policy expectations even before the new Fed Chair is sworn in.\n\nThe calculus being made in the bond market seems to be that Hassett could lower rates too far, too fast, aggravating inflation and prompting a hawkish response from the Fed down the road.\n\n\"Something that every Fed Chair has traditionally had to do from day one is establish credibility as a legitimate inflation fighter. If they don't, they introduce volatility into the Treasury markets and create broad unease, which no one wants,\" he added.\n\nTorsten Sløk, the chief economist at Apollo, also flicked at this disconnect between rate expectations and bond yields in a note on Wednesday.\n\n\"Why are long-term interest rates going up when the Fed is cutting rates,\" Sløk wrote. \"Is the market worried about growing Treasury issuance, or about a new Fed leadership effectively raising the inflation target from 2% to, say, 4%?\" he added, referring to how higher debt levels can also stoke inflation in the future.\n\nEven without inflation complicating things, investors aren't confident that the Fed has the green light to keep cutting rates in 2026.\n\nInterest rates already appear to be close to neutral, a level that prompts neither economic expansion nor contraction, according to Chris Brigati, the chief investment officer at SWBC.\n\n\"We expect the Fed to remain on hold when it comes to rates for the first half of 2026, even with the pressure from the many doves,\" Brigati said on Wednesday, adding that he only expects the Fed to issue one rate cut next year.\n\nStrategists at Deutsche Bank said this week that they expect the 10-year US Treasury to climb to around 4.45% by mid-next year, a jump of about 25 basis points from current levels.\n\n\"This mildly bearish view is predicated on expectations of a more hawkish Fed rate cut path than market pricing,\" the bank wrote in a note on Tuesday.\n\nInvestors are pricing in a 58% chance the Fed will only lower interest rates once or twice by the end of 2026, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\n\nThe US bond market is following a broader trend as investors expect less monetary easing from central banks around the world in the coming year.\n\nThe yield on the British 10-year gilt traded around 4.52% on Wednesday, around 14 basis points higher than its low in November.\n\nThe yield on the German 10-year Bund also rose to 2.86% on Wednesday, around 22 basis points higher from its latest low.\n\nJapan's 10-year note was yielding around 1.95% this week, up around 29 basis points from the start of November.\n\n\"Long-dated government bonds in many developed markets (DMs) have sold off aggressively over the past month or so as investors have pared back rate cut expectations or, increasingly, pencilled in rate hikes,\" James Reilly, a senior markets economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note on Tuesday.\n\n\"While we think these moves are overdone in many economies, we think there is still room for investors to pare back expectations for Fed easing,\" he added.",

    "description": "I returned to work to fund my son's ballet training, but the job became more than income and it reignited my sense of identity.",
    "fullText": "I watched my 7-year-old son observing his younger sister taking her first dance class. She skipped across the floor, jumping over a taped marking. His eyes were glued to each move. \"Mom, can I take this class?\" he asked. We'd spent the last week discussing swimming lessons, but dance could fill its place, so he joined.\n\nIn the following months, I observed that ballet gave my son problem-solving skills in the form of choreography. At 14, he played Pinocchio. By the end of the performance, I'd felt his character's entire journey. This was when I knew ballet was more than an activity. He wanted to become a professional.\n\nWhich then led me to question — could we afford it?\n\nMy husband and I spoke to his teachers, looked at dance blogs, and learned as much about the ballet world as possible. He could try many options, such as summer intensives, competitions, attending an academy associated with a company, or applying to a college with a dance major. Most of these options meant sending away a kid much younger than 18 years old — something that scared me.\n\nWhen my son received a scholarship to a dance academy at 17, I struggled to imagine how we could afford living expenses. I began to wonder if I could work part-time and still be a homeschool mom of 10. It was a plus that my husband worked from home, and that I'd spent years creating a morning school schedule for the kids. Some of them already helped me cook dinner on nights I had to drive other kids to activities. I'd miss being home full-time, but thankfully, my husband could help.\n\nMy previous employment included a few hours at a college campus day care, working as an assistant for a small-business owner, and clerical duties in an X-ray department at our local hospital. A company that takes pride in matching employees with employers thought my best lead would be to look at the three colleges in town and see if they had any openings.\n\n\"There's a job at my alma mater,\" my husband said a few days after I'd mentioned that going back to work could be a way to pay for our son's living expenses at the ballet academy. The post was for an Assistant to the Office of Belonging. Writing a cover letter for this was feasible. I was empathetic toward students of color as a Bangladeshi British American adoptee. One of the college classes I took introduced me to bell hooks, Patricia Williams, and W.E.B. DuBois. When it came to office work, I knew how to use Microsoft Office, and picking up new skills wouldn't have been too difficult.\n\nMy husband went on to say, \"I bet my professor would write you a recommendation.\" We'd stayed in touch with him and his wife. Only, I found out that this job would be working for him. I hoped my application was good enough.\n\nI went to two interviews. Within a few weeks, or friend said, \"I'd like to hire you.\"\n\nThe first day, I put my 2-year-old son down for a nap, organized dinner with the older kids, and walked into my office. I jumped into planning events, meeting with student groups, and creating a newsletter. I noticed patterns of tasks that reminded me of the early days as a new mother.\n\nWhen I didn't know what to do with a baby, I'd created a schedule for my sanity. I hoped it would help him, too. At work, I studied the calendar of events. Blank days filled up quickly. When my boss assigned me more projects, I was already accustomed to figuring out how to integrate a new agenda item into my day. When homeschooling my older kids, my attention was divided between them and the ones who were much younger.\n\nOne area where I surprised myself the most was feeling confident in meeting a lot of new people to form collaborations. In my previous jobs, I'd been timid when it came to talking to clients at the hospital or the parents of the kids I watched at day care. My boss instructed me to smile at clients. As a parent, I pushed myself to talk to other new moms at the library and in the park to form a community. In the workplace, I utilized these skills to identify opportunities for interdepartmental collaboration and establish myself as a valuable resource for others.\n\nEighteen years ago, I would have felt lost in my current job. Working on a university campus has become a source of inspiration. Although I'm not a student, I find myself setting new life goals. I never expected my son's desired career to also uncover my unknown dreams.",

    "title": "Meet Gen Z's latest obsession: A sneaker so bouncy it's banned in major races",
    "description": "Asics Novablasts have become popular among Gen Z runners, beating out similar Nike and Hoka models.",
    "fullText": "While Nike and Hoka have been some of the buzziest running brands in recent years, a new shoe reigned supreme this year: the Asics Novablast.\n\nA recent Strava report, which tracked which optional \"gear\" users selected on their uploaded runs, found that Asics' $150 sneakers beat out Nike Pegasus and Hoka Clifton models, both of which can retail for slightly more (depending on the exact model).\n\n\"After run number one, my feet were feeling happy,\" Keltie O'Connor, a runner and YouTuber, said in her 2024 TikTok review. She raved about how soft they were, without feeling like a memory foam mattress.\n\nMichael Mazzara, the CEO of Half Marathon Guide and Rogue Expeditions, a running tour company, said the data made sense; both complete beginners and more experienced runners gravitate toward the shoes' extreme cushioning.\n\nThey also make it easier to run faster — so much so that some formal races, like the Ironman, ban them for giving runners too much of an advantage.\n\n\"It's become a lot more common that people want really, really springy shoes to feel like they're going faster or to reduce the impact on their joints,\" Mazzara said. \"They created a really accessible shoe to feel like you felt pretty invincible, even if you just got out there.\"\n\nWhile wearing bouncier shoes can feel great, even exhilarating, there are some long-term drawbacks. When it comes to long-distance running and extensive training, extreme comfort can be too much of a good thing, masking injuries around the corner.\n\nBecause of its high stack height, Mazzara said the shoe can feel very forgiving, especially for beginners. \"You feel like you just have to think a little bit less about your cadence and your stride because the shoe's doing a lot of the work for you.\"\n\nIt's also very fun to run in, he said, even though it's not technically a race shoe. Novablasts are made for daily training and long runs, unlike carbon-plated race shoes such as Nike Alphaflys, which are designed to increase speed and shouldn't be worn as frequently.\n\nEven so, Novablasts feel like race shoes. \"They're really springy, and you feel like you're running very fast,\" he said. \"It's something that people haven't really felt before about a daily trainer.\"\n\nIn general, running brands like Asics, Nike, Hoka, and Brooks have been investing in foamier, bouncier shoes.\n\nAylin Woodward of The Wall Street Journal reported that \"super shoes\" — sneakers with both carbon-plating and high stack heights — have blown up in the past decade after professional marathoners shaved minutes off their finish times with them.\n\nUltra-bouncy shoes like Novablasts can also feel like a solution to both new and burned-out runners alike, Mazzara said. If you're a total beginner, new aches and pains can feel concerning — even discouraging. \"Then, all of a sudden, you try on a shoe that feels like a Moon Boot to run in.\" You're immediately faster than ever, with no immediate downsides.\n\nFor long-term runners who've been running in the same, less-cushioned trainers for years, the sudden switch can be a much-needed mental refresh. Feeling automatically faster \"reinvigorates the excitement of daily training and racing,\" he said.\n\nThere are some downsides to the shoe-cushioning arms race.\n\nDr. Courtney Conley, chiropractic physician specializing in foot and gait mechanics, said in a Diary of a CEO interview that tall, bouncy shoes like Nike Alphaflys can weaken muscles in the foot.\n\n\"If you train in them all the time, and you never let your foot get stronger, it's just a matter of time,\" she said, before you start feeling hamstring issues.\n\nIn his own experience wearing Novablasts, Mazzara said he felt like he didn't have to think about his running form as much. That eventually caught up with him: \"I got injured disproportionately more than using a more conventional, less springy shoe,\" he said.\n\nAsics did not respond to Business Insider's request to comment.\n\nMazzara and runners he knows, especially longtime ones in their 40s to 60s, prefer shoes like the Nike Pegasus or Hoka Clifton because they offer ample support without as much bounciness, Mazzara said. The shoes feel stabler in the long run, even if they're a little less exciting.\n\nFor running beginners who don't know where to start, Mazzara recommended going to a running store to find the perfect fit for your foot shape and stride.\n\nThe best principle to follow is also the simplest, he said: \"When it comes to running, find something that you love to run in until you love running.\"",

    "description": "MrBeast laid out how he's updating his YouTube strategy with a focus on storytelling and longer videos, and new formats like animation.",
    "fullText": "MrBeast became YouTube's top star by making videos featuring stunts like burying himself alive or lavish cash giveaways. But could that format be reaching its limit?\n\nMrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, recently posted that he wasn't satisfied with the quality of his videos and promised to go into \"ultra grind mode and make the greatest content of my life in 2026.\"\n\nElaborating in an interview this month, he said he's focusing on stories that are impactful or get people to \"feel things.\"\n\n\"We spent millions of dollars a video and we do these big spectacles,\" he said, speaking at The New York Times' DealBook Summit. \"After a while, you do get a little numb to money being given away or numb to spectacles, but hearing a great story is something that you never get numb to.\"\n\nHis comments came as MrBeast has been trying to bring costs under control at his company's media arm, which lost money on its extravagant videos in 2024. Under Jeffrey Housenbold, who became CEO of the holding company Beast Industries in 2024, MrBeast is looking for sponsors to offset the cost of those elaborate videos. Donaldson has spoken about losing millions of dollars on season one of his Amazon show, \"Beast Games,\" and said at DealBook that seasons two and three would be \"more efficient.\"\n\nBeyond videos, MrBeast is also trying to branch out to new areas like a mobile phone business and financial services as he tries to grow the company into a wide-ranging conglomerate.\n\nIn the interview, Donaldson touched on other ways he's shifting his video strategy besides a focus on story. He's looking to longer videos, encouraged by their surging popularity on YouTube, which people are increasingly watching on TV screens. Donaldson said MrBeast videos have doubled in length and now run close to 25 minutes.\n\nOther formats are in the works. MrBeast just started producing animation and has mulled micro dramas, the made-for-mobile scripted format that was popularized in China and has grown rapidly in the US.\n\nLike many creators, MrBeast is aware of the limitations of being too dependent on his own image. Donaldson said he's working to change the mix so his videos don't rely too much on him being in them. He also wants to use his videos to showcase his mission-driven interests, like sourcing ethical ingredients for his chocolate bars.\n\n\"Whether it's me in the videos or not, I hope people like me, but it's not fundamentally why we get 200 million views for every video,\" he said. \"A lot of times it's because we do these crazy concepts and all these other things that are more replicable. So that's why we're working on building out other channels and other IP.\"\n\nWhen asked about the harms of social media, he swiped at TikTok, calling its videos \"crack cocaine\" and \"brain rot\" while saying YouTube has more educational content. Donaldson, who is one of TikTok's top creators, said he couldn't afford to ignore the platform because of its importance in reaching certain groups of users.\n\n\"We try very hard on TikTok, we try very hard on Instagram, because, obviously, Instagram, a lot of women use that that might not use TikTok or, use YouTube,\" he said. \"In their world, if you're not on that platform, you just don't exist. So they're all important.\"",

    "fullText": "There are over 20,000 bee species worldwide, and one more was just added to the list after a survey of pollinators in one of Australia's remotest areas.\n\nThe Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported that a new \"horned\" bee species was discovered in the Bremer Range in Western Australia. The area is some 600 kilometers (373 miles) east of Perth, one of the world's most remote cities.\n\nDr. Kit Prendergast, a native bee scientist, was stunned by the area's biodiversity, saying: \"I have never seen so many insects — not just native bees, but wasps, flies. It was incredible.\"\n\nThe highlight of the trip was examining the critically endangered native flower, Marianthus aquilonaris, which is endemic to the Bremer Range. Prendergast noticed it was being tended to by a distinctive-looking pollinator. Its head was adorned with what appeared to be a pair of horns. This never-before-seen bee was dubbed the Lucifer bee after the Netflix show.\n\nIt's not yet clear what function the \"horns\" perform, but only females have them. They are solitary bees. Bees are thought of as social creatures who live in large colonies, but that's not actually the case for the overwhelming majority of bee species.\n\nAbout 90% of the world's bee species are solitary, and females do all of the work, from pollinating to rearing young. In other words, like most working mothers, all female, solitary bees can be considered queens.\n\nFew people live in the area, but it is known for mining activity, which is lucrative but causes immense ecological destruction. With more projects in the works, the discovery of the Lucifer bee raises important questions about the environmental impact of land clearing for mining. It's also a reminder of the wonderful secrets that still remain untouched in nature.\n\nEconomic development does not have to come at the expense of biodiversity, but that is far too often the case. That's why staying informed and engaging in productive conversations to help spread the word are so important to protecting the voiceless victims of unsustainable growth.\n\nDo you think we still have a lot to learn from ancient cultures?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "A two-day undercover sting targeting men trying to buy sex in North Texas resulted in 20 arrests at a Fort Worth hotel in November.\n\nAll arrested face felony charges of solicitation of prostitution, which carries a possible sentence of up to two years in prison for a first offense.\n\nThe Tarrant County Sheriff's Office emphasized the high local demand for commercial sex, noting that the majority of victims, traffickers, and buyers are local residents.\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas - A two-day undercover sting in November led to 20 arrests as the Tarrant County Sheriff’s Office targeted people attempting to buy sex in North Texas, authorities said.\n\nFOX 4 reporter, Peyton Yager, was granted rare behind-the-scenes access as members of the sheriff’s human trafficking unit, along with investigators from the Texas Department of Public Safety and Arlington police, conducted operations inside a Fort Worth hotel. The sting focused on men responding to online solicitation ads posted by undercover officers.\n\nInvestigators said the operation began long before officers knocked on hotel room doors. At the sheriff’s administrative building, undercover personnel posing as women posted advertisements offering sex acts for specific prices, a requirement under Texas law to meet the definition of solicitation of prostitution.\n\nOnce a suspect agreed to a sex act and a dollar amount, investigators used the phone number to run background checks and prepare the team positioned at the hotel.\n\n\"We need them to identify what sex act they want and also have the dollar amount exchanged,\" said Melinda Clark of the sheriff’s human trafficking unit.\n\nAs the men arrived for their appointments, officers moved in. Some were arrested immediately upon entering the room, while others attempted to flee or resist as officers subdued them. Turner said it is common during operations to communicate with hundreds of potential buyers, even if only a fraction ultimately shows up.\n\nThose arrested included a church sign-language interpreter, men with families and at least one person officers said intended to take a woman to a truck stop to be trafficked. Several suspects also faced drug possession or resisting arrest charges.\n\nAll were booked into the Tarrant County Jail on charges of solicitation of prostitution, which is a felony in Texas and carries a possible sentence of up to two years in prison for a first offense. None of the men has been convicted in the cases stemming from this operation.\n\n\"This is occurring every day,\" said Commander Kevin Turner, who leads the county’s human trafficking team. \"It’s unimaginable how much there is out there.\"\n\n\"It shows how strong the demand for commercial sex is here in North Texas,\" he said.\n\nTurner emphasized that human trafficking does not fit common misconceptions.\n\n\"The majority of our victims, especially when it comes to sex trafficking, were born and raised here locally,\" he said. \"The traffickers are born and raised here locally. Our buyers are born and raised here locally.\"\n\nThe nonprofit DeliverFund provided technology and data support during the sting. \"It gets busy sometimes,\" said DeliverFund’s Alisha Willemssen. \"Keeping track of who is talking to whom\" helps investigators avoid overlap as they pose as multiple online identities.\n\nAdvocates say arrests alone won’t curb the problem.\n\nThe Fort Worth nonprofit, The Net, works with survivors and also with men arrested for solicitation through its MASE (Men Against Sexual Exploitation) program, offering resources in hopes of reducing repeat offenses.\n\n\"We know that just the threat of arrest or jail time alone is not going to keep them from doing this again,\" said Ty Bowden, the organization’s associate director. \"We want to get at the root of what’s bringing them here.\"\n\nThe Tarrant County human trafficking unit, formed in 2021, has conducted several stings in recent years. As large-scale events such as the 2026 World Cup approach, Turner said law enforcement agencies are preparing for increased demand and continuing to refine their response.\n\n\"They really wanted to show how prevalent it is,\" he said, \"and how it happens at hotels near you.\"\n\nInformation in this story was provided by FOX 4's Peyton Yager.",

    "description": "YouTube TV will offer a cheaper sports-focused package in 2026, which it can offer after tough negotiations with Disney and other media companies.",
    "fullText": "YouTube TV will unveil new prices soon. But this time, it will be good news for sports fans.\n\nYouTube is launching a set of cheaper, slimmed-down versions of its popular live TV service in 2026, which it's calling \"YouTube TV Plans,\" the video giant announced on Wednesday. One of the new plans will be a sports bundle that provides access to ESPN Unlimited, FS1, and NBC Sports Network.\n\nWhile YouTube TV isn't yet revealing pricing for these 10 or so genre-specific packages, they'll cost less than the Google-owned service's typical rate, which is $83 a month.\n\n\"Our goal is to let you tailor your subscription with more options,\" said Christian Oestlien, YouTube's head of subscriptions, in a statement. \"Whether you stick with our main YouTube TV plan with 100+ channels, focus on sports, combine sports and news, or select a plan centered on family or entertainment content, subscribers will be able to easily choose the plan that works best for them.\"\n\nYouTube TV secured the rights to form these so-called \"skinny bundles\" after hard-fought negotiations with Disney, Comcast's NBC, and Fox. YouTube TV's battle with Disney was especially intense, as it left subscribers without ESPN and ABC for 15 days.\n\nJustin Connolly, YouTube's global head of media and sports, said at a media event on Tuesday night that YouTube worked with its partners on \"ingesting the entirety of the sports programming\" in its service, so that YouTube TV can be a one-stop shop for sports fans. Besides aggregating live games, Connolly said YouTube is being fan-friendly by aiming to \"meet the consumer where they are\" on price.\n\nYouTube TV's price has steadily increased since it launched in 2017 at $35, though it's also added more channels. Last December, YouTube TV's monthly price rose by $10.\n\nOther TV providers have launched sports-focused skinny bundles, with some tradeoffs.\n\nFubo's $55.99 a month Sports + News bundle includes all of ESPN and Fox's channels, plus CBS and the NFL Network, but it doesn't have NBC or Warner Bros. Discovery's networks like TNT or TruTV. It also doesn't have the news networks CNN and MS Now (formerly MSNBC), though it has Fox News.\n\nSling TV's Orange & Blue bundle goes for $60.99 and has ESPN, Fox with cable sidekick FS1, WBD's channels like TNT and CNN, and the NFL Network. It also carries local channels like NBC and ABC in certain markets. But Sling doesn't have a deal with CBS, plus its main bundle doesn't include specialty sports networks like the SEC Network, the Big Ten Network, or NBA TV. Sling offers a Sports Extra add-on for $15 a month on its main plan, bringing the total to $76.\n\nDirecTV's MySports package costs $69.99 but is more comprehensive, with the full suites of ESPN, Fox, and WBD, plus all four major local broadcast networks: ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox (with possible exceptions in certain markets). It also carries the flagship networks for four major US sports: the NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL.\n\nSports fans could complement those skinny bundles by buying a digital antenna or by using streaming services like Peacock or Paramount+ that give access to NBC and CBS, respectively.\n\nESPN also offers a subscription to its entire suite for $29.99 a month, or a bundle with competing streamer Fox One for $39.99 a month.\n\nYouTube said its new sports plan will have ESPN's full suite of programming plus sports channels from Fox and NBC, with the option to add on NFL Sunday Ticket and RedZone for more money. Otherwise, it's unclear exactly which channels this bundle will have.\n\nAs YouTube TV's sports bundle enters the market, sports fans have more choices than ever. The challenge for them now is finding the right plan.",

    "fullText": "Eric Jackson, the architect of this year's meme-like rally in Opendoor Technologies stock, is out with his latest bullish target.\n\nJackson revealed a long position in Nextdoor on December 10, describing the company as a misunderstood play on the agentic AI theme. The localized social media network has struggled recently and is down 15% year-to-date, trading at just over $2 a share, but it's up as much as 30% since last Friday.\n\nJackson said he thinks Nextdoor has significant growth potential as an AI platform, and investors on Wednesday appear to be warming to his bullish thesis.\n\nSince the summer, retail investors have been keen to get a peak into what could be the next Opendoor, which has seen its share price surge 1,100% in the last six months.\n\nJackson argues that Nextdoor can do the same.\n\n🚀 NEXTDOOR ($NXDR ): The Most Mispriced Agentic-AI Platform of the 2020s\n\nA Rising Dynasty blueprint for a potential multi-S-curve re-rating.\n\nEvery cycle, a few platforms stay misunderstood for years…\nuntil one moment reframes everything.\n\nNextdoor at ~$2.00 today feels like…\n\n\"When these layers align — as they did with CVNA, PLTR, and OPEN — markets respond dramatically. Nextdoor checks every layer and is ready like them for a massive re-rating,\" he stated.\n\nLater in the thread, Jackson added that Nextdoor should be seen not as a social network but as a verified networking graph for households around the world.\n\nIn his view, much larger tech companies, such as Facebook and Microsoft, have failed to create a localized social network like Nextdoor's.\n\nNow he thinks Nextdoor's strategic use of agentic AI, such as the \"Faves\" AI agent that helps provide recommendations, makes the stock a key AI play.\n\n\"NXDR trades only ~2M shares/day on a 224M float — very low effective liquidity,\" Jackson said. \"When a new valuation framework hits a thinly traded, under-followed name, the narrative can shift faster than models update. That's not a promise — it's just how reflexivity works.\"\n\nJackson has shared bullish takes on other stocks since the Opendoor rally, including Better Home & Finance, which he argues is set to change the market for home loans.",

    "title": "Wins, setbacks, and rivalries: Inside Cindy Rose's first 100 days as CEO of ad giant WPP",
    "description": "Cindy Rose faces mounting pressure to stabilize ad agency titan WPP. So far in her tenure, wins have been dampened by bad news.",
    "fullText": "When Cindy Rose took the helm at the advertising agency giant WPP in September, she inherited one of the most challenging jobs on Madison Avenue.\n\nBattered by a period of big account losses, internal restructuring, and thousands of layoffs, morale had sunk. So had the share price. London-based WPP was trading at lows not seen since 2009, and the company had warned investors that the remainder of the year would continue to be rocky.\n\nInsiders and shareholders were hopeful that Rose, a US-born executive most recently at Microsoft, could serve as a kind of Goldilocks porridge compared to her predecessors. She was widely seen as a happy medium between Martin Sorrell, the outspoken British business mogul who had built WPP from the ground up over 33 years, and Mark Read, the more introverted operator who took over in 2018.\n\nRose was described by one analyst as a \"peacemaker,\" and her tech background and experience in maintaining client relationships were viewed as positive attributes that would help bring about much-needed change.\n\nThis week, Rose marked her 100th day in the role. Darren Woolley, CEO of the management consultancy Trinity P3, scored Rose a \"7.8 out of 10\" for her performance so far.\n\n\"She's saying all the right things and has sent some signals to the market. The big test will be what happens early next year, as she sets out her strategy,\" Woolley said. \"Cindy will not last a year if they don't believe the strategy can be delivered.\"\n\nRose's wins during her first 100 days — some major new business, key hires, a big partnership with Google, and an oversubscribed bond sale — have been dampened by bad news.\n\nOn her first earnings call, in October, Rose described the company's performance as \"unacceptable.\" Shortly after delivering its second profit warning of the year and downgrading its full-year growth forecast, its shares spiraled further downward, and WPP was demoted from the FTSE 100 index of the UK's largest publicly listed companies. Shares of the London-listed company have dropped by about 18% since Rose became chief executive.\n\nAdding to Rose's overflowing in-tray, WPP was hit with a lawsuit from one of its former executives who said he was fired in July of this year — before Rose's arrival as CEO — after he raised concerns internally that the group's media investment division was allegedly running a kickback scheme. WPP said in November it would \"vigorously\" defend itself against the allegations made in the suit. The case is ongoing.\n\nWPP has fallen behind the sector's star performer, Publicis Groupe, and it faces a new titan following the combo of Omnicom and IPG this year. Agencyland also faces a bigger, existential quandary: What is the role of a large advertising agency holding company amid the rise of tech and the emergence of AI solutions that claim to automate much of the work agencies charge top dollar for?\n\nThis account of Rose's tenure so far draws on interviews with more than a dozen current and former WPP staffers and clients, competitors, marketing consultants, and industry analysts. They said Rose deserves credit for delivering a positive narrative about WPP's opportunities while also owning its problems. Much of her fate will rest on a strategy plan that she has said she will outline fully next year. Insiders and analysts said her strategy will need to be bold and visionary, given the challenges ahead.\n\nRose told Business Insider in a statement that in her first 100 days, she has actively sought feedback from WPP's top clients to help create a blueprint for what the company needs to do differently in the future.\n\n\"I'm most proud of our WPP employees for their incredible resilience, client obsession, and passion to win, which is already making a difference, and you can see it in the business that we're winning: Mastercard, Reckitt, Henkel, and more to come,\" Rose said.\n\nThis past September, from the company's 3 World Trade Center campus in New York City, Rose laid out a three-pronged blueprint for what she called \"a new WPP\" at her first global town hall as CEO. Her first priority was \"putting people first\" by creating an environment for employees to thrive. She said WPP should be famous for \"being completely client-obsessed\" as part of her \"winning for clients\" principle. And she said WPP should be \"harnessing our AI advantage,\" telling staffers to become \"AI superusers.\"\n\nHer opening address to employees was received well internally, insiders said.\n\n\"We were pleasantly surprised,\" one current senior WPP agency staffer said. They added that Rose is \"so much better at the human stuff\" than her predecessors and said she had kept the company regularly updated with videos talking up the agency's wins.\n\nWPP has been heavily pitching WPP Open, an internal AI-powered platform that integrates with technology from companies such as OpenAI, Meta, and Salesforce. It connects signals from clients' own first-party data, partners, and WPP's data on the performance of thousands of campaigns to help plan and place ads, and measure the results.\n\nIn October, with Rose firmly in situ, WPP announced WPP Open Pro, a self-service version to give clients their own access to the platform. The aim was to grow WPP's client base by appealing to smaller advertisers or direct-to-consumer companies that tend to handle much of their marketing in-house. WPP told staffers internally that more than 400 brands had proactively contacted the company about Open Pro in the three weeks after it launched.\n\nDouglas Hayward and Gerry Murray, analysts at the research company IDC, described the Open Pro launch in a report as \"a smart move that shows that WPP is prepared to be bold and innovative and even to cannibalize its revenue in the short term.\"\n\nHowever, some analysts questioned whether WPP would be able to invest enough in marketing Open Pro to appeal to this sort of audience, which is accustomed to using tools provided by tech giants like Meta and Google.\n\nNearly all of WPP's rivals are also leaning heavily into their tech investments and offerings as part of their pitches to clients and investors.\n\nOne former WPP agency executive, who left last year, said they felt Rose should be more proactive in emphasizing the company's creative prowess as something that sets it apart from other agency holding groups and the broader tech sector.\n\n\"Creativity is the only thing that human beings have got to make a difference,\" the exec said.\n\nAgency relationships with tech platforms are an important part of the mix as they try to differentiate themselves from competitors. This fall, in Mountain View, Rose signed a key deal with Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian, which sent a signal out to the market, clients, and its rivals about the strength of WPP's relationship with Google. The \"expanded five-year partnership\" was billed as going far beyond typical agency-Google setups. WPP said it would commit to spending $400 million on Google's tech as part of the partnership, which will give it \"preferred\" access to Google's latest AI models and data. Google is also one of WPP's biggest clients.\n\nSave for her welcome address to staffers, which was posted on YouTube, and her first earnings call, Rose has kept a fairly low public profile.\n\nIn November, she appeared at an AI conference in New York City, hosted by Microsoft and Luma Partners, an investment bank. Attendees — who included roughly 100 high-profile tech, advertising, and media executives — said she was whisked away by her handlers into the green room before her talk, a session with Google Americas President Sean Downey, and made a swift exit afterward.\n\nThree attendees said they felt Rose missed an opportunity.\n\n\"Martin, in the old days, would have worked the room for one hour,\" one person said, referring to Sorrell, the former WPP CEO.\n\nAt the moment, WPP is a company that \"needs more visible leadership for the market, for the staff, for the shareholders, for the clients,\" Trinity P3's Woolley said.\n\nRose enters an advertising agency landscape that has fundamentally changed. For years, WPP was the top dog. WPP under Sorrell built a formidable empire, acquiring creative agencies and PR shops around the world, and building GroupM (now known as WPP Media) into a huge force, responsible for planning and buying billions of dollars in media across TV, print, out-of-home, and digital.\n\nThe market dynamics shifted, largely due to the emergence of tech giants like Google, Meta, and Amazon, which offer self-service tools that let advertisers bypass agencies. AI has only sped up the disruption. In recent years, clients have pressured agencies to produce more work at lower costs. Agencies have had to respond by retooling to offer marketers more services than just producing and placing ads.\n\nRival ad firm Publicis recognized these shifts early. It made first-party data and technology services its citadels and simplified its pitch around a \"power of one\" operating strategy. In 2024, the French company became the biggest holding company by revenue, and over the past 18 months has won a string of clients — including many from WPP.\n\nPublicis CEO Arthur Sadoun is described by many in the industry as a charismatic and omnipresent force of nature with clients, and a fierce competitor to Rose as she seeks to retain major accounts and acquire new ones.\n\nDuring the pitch process this year for Mars' $1.7 billion media business — before Rose was in-post as WPP CEO — the confectionery giant summoned all the agencies involved to meet on a cold January morning at the M&M's Store in central London.\n\nSadoun turned up about an hour earlier than the scheduled time. The Mars clients hadn't arrived yet, and the doors to the store were locked shut. He waited outside on Leicester Square. Once Mars' marketing team arrived, Sadoun greeted them, and they duly invited him in for coffee — much to the chagrin of the competing agencies, who weren't able to take advantage of the opportunity to get extra face time with the clients. Mars this summer moved its media account from WPP to Publicis.\n\n\"There are two types of people in life: The ones who are five minutes early and the ones who are five minutes late. It's a personal choice, and Arthur has decided to use these rules for unfair advantage by arriving 10 minutes early,\" said Richard Robinson, executive director of Ingenuity+, an agency search consultancy that wasn't involved in the Mars pitch.\n\nThree marketing consultants involved in client pitches said Rose is also visible and warm with clients, delivering passionate addresses and asking personal questions. They say Sadoun takes it to the next level.\n\nFocus now turns to 2026 after WPP's annus horribilis.\n\nWPP has appointed the management consulting firm McKinsey to assist Rose in conducting a strategic review of the business. Rose said in October that she would detail the outcome in the new year.\n\nInsiders and analysts predict further layoffs amid a shrinking agency landscape. Jay Pattisall, principal analyst and VP at the research company, forecasts a 15% reduction in agency jobs across the industry as automation and AI force agencies to \"pivot from selling services to selling solutions.\"\n\nThe open question is whether WPP can be optimized to success, or whether it will have to sell some or all of its business in order to best position itself for the future. Or could WPP even pull an Omnicom and acquire a rival? Two people with direct knowledge of the matter said WPP had multiple conversations about a potential acquisition of the US-centric media buying company Horizon over the years, but that the talks never came close to a deal. A Horizon spokesperson said the company doesn't comment on speculation.\n\n\"They need to do some kind of jujitsu,\" a second former WPP executive said, referring to an unexpected M&A move to outmaneuver rivals.\n\nAs insiders await the outcome of the review, WPP is expected to soon start feeling the impact of some recent sizable new business wins. It secured more than $1.5 billion in billings in November alone, including the consumer goods company Reckitt appointing WPP as its media agency of record and Henkel awarding WPP the media duties for its European consumer brands. WPP was further buoyed this week after its Wavemaker media agency secured a four-year contract, worth up to $2.6 billion, to produce the UK government's ad campaigns — an account previously held by Omnicom.\n\nRose has also made some key leadership appointments and formed a new executive management team that could help rally the troops and boost momentum. In one notable hire — and a poke in the eye to rival Sadoun — she persuaded Laurent Ezekiel, who was formerly WPP's CMO, to reverse a planned move to Publicis and become CEO of the WPP agency Ogilvy instead.\n\nSome investors appear optimistic that Rose can steer the company back on course. This month, investors ordered nearly €3 billion (about $3.5 billion) of WPP's 5.5-year bonds, even though the company only issued €1 billion (about $1.2 billion). The strong oversubscription suggests these institutional investors believe WPP will stay financially stable and meet its debt obligations.\n\nRose, in her statement, said that her vision for WPP is clear and that AI would usher in a \"golden age of marketing.\"\n\nLooking ahead to 2026, she said WPP's greatest opportunity is \"to enable our clients to move boldly and confidently into the future and help them fully embrace AI innovation to reimagine growth and unleash their true potential.\"",

    "title": "McDonald's faces backlash after airing 2025 Christmas commercial: 'This is just … terrible'",
    "description": "\"I’m old enough to remember when McDonald’s was the gold standard of advertising.\"",
    "fullText": "A Dutch McDonald's commercial was made entirely using AI, and the backlash has been severe, according to NDTV.\n\nThe ad featured families grappling with the chaos of the holiday season, including decorations, traffic jams, and family gatherings. The whole ad was punctuated by a satirical soundtrack dubbed \"The Most Terrible Time of the Year.\"\n\nMcDonald's has released an AI-generated Christmas ad\n\nThe studio behind it says they 'hardly slept' for several weeks while writing AI prompts and refining the shots — 'AI didn't make this film. We did'\n\nComments have been turned off on YouTube pic.twitter.com/Es5ROvI7n2\n\n— Culture Crave (@CultureCrave) December 8, 2025\n\nThe reception to the ad has been so negative that McDonald's pulled the ad off YouTube after closing comments. The marketing firm behind the ad has defended its use of AI.\n\n\"AI didn't 'make' McDonald's Christmas ad. We did,\" said The Sweetshop CEO Melanie Bridge in a recent interview with Little Black Book. \"This script was always designed for AI, not as a gimmick, but because the scale simply couldn't exist in live action without a monstrous budget and a freezing European winter shoot.\"\n\nAnother food and beverage giant, Coca-Cola, recently got into hot water over its own AI-powered ad campaign.\n\nWhile public opinion has squarely criticized the quality of the output and the erosion of creative professions, there's an environmental cost to generating AI video content as well.\n\nIncreased data center use for AI has single-handedly ramped up energy use and subsequent pollution. Training AI models can require a lot of energy, and work on this project also took several weeks, according to Culture Crave on X, with some wondering in the comments how much more effective such an ad could really be over a more organically created one on a smaller budget.\n\nRegardless of its effectiveness in helping a company attract and retain customers to make up for its budget without repelling other potential customers, an ad like this carries a hefty amount of atmospheric pollution along with it.\n\nPollution from dirty energy warms our planet, which in turn exacerbates growingly destructive weather patterns. This can create problems in agriculture, housing, and other areas of living.\n\nSocial media reactions to the McDonald's AI ad were decidedly negative.\n\n\"I'm old enough to remember when McDonald's was the gold standard of advertising,\" wrote one X user. \"This is just a terrible commercial.\"\n\n\"Finally their ads match the food, mass production with not much soul,\" replied another.\n\nShould the U.S. government ban all products tested on animals?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "\"He's got a great sense of humor,\" Musk said of Trump. \"He's very funny, he's like naturally funny. It's somewhat effortless.\"",
    "fullText": "Asked who was the funniest person he knew in real life, Elon Musk had a somewhat surprising answer.\n\n\"You know, President Trump is very funny. He's got a great sense of humor,\" Musk said on an episode of The Katie Miller Podcast released on Tuesday. \"He's very funny, he's like naturally funny. It's somewhat effortless.\"\n\nMusk pointed to President Donald Trump's meeting with New York City Mayor-Elect Zohran Mamdani last month, when a reporter asked Mamdani if he stood by his opinion that Trump is a \"fascist.\"\n\n\"And the president said, 'Just say yes. It's easier that way,\"' Musk said, breaking into laughter. \"'Don't worry about it. Just say yes.'\"\n\n\"How silly,\" Musk added after further laughter.\n\nElon Musk, who is a South African immigrant who votes in the US, is upset that Somali Americans in Minnesota get to vote. He's also saying that Zohran Mamdani won because the majority of people who voted for him weren't born in America. pic.twitter.com/6mToXTNV8y\n\nMusk's comments marked yet another turn in his evolving relationship with Trump. The two men appear to have mostly put their differences behind them, with Musk even visiting the White House for a dinner last month.\n\nStill, Musk said in that same interview that he wouldn't have led the DOGE effort if he could go back in time, despite believing the effort to be a \"little bit successful.\"\n\n\"I think instead of doing DOGE, I would have basically built, you know, worked on my companies, essentially, and the cars — they wouldn't have been burning the cars,\" Musk said.",

    "title": "Look inside the Armour-Stiner Octagon House, an ornate 19th-century mansion in New York, decorated for the holidays",
    "description": "The Armour-Stiner Octagon House in Irvington, New York, is a whimsical example of a 19th-century, eight-sided mansion.",
    "fullText": "In the mid-19th century, the concept of octagon houses was all the rage among fashionable Americans.\n\nIts popularity was attributed to a best-selling 1848 book by Orson Squire Fowler, a phrenologist, sexologist, and amateur architect, called \"The Octagon House: A Home For All.\"\n\nFowler championed eight-sided houses because they received twice as much light as a traditional four-sided property and allowed owners to view the grounds from all angles.\n\nThe Armour-Stiner Octagon House in the New York City suburb of Irvington-on-Hudson, around 18 miles from the northern tip of Manhattan, is a prime example of the genre.\n\nUnusually for an octagon house, it features a giant dome, added by its second owner, Joseph H. Stiner, a wealthy tea and coffee merchant who bought the property in 1872.\n\nThe result is a fairytale residence that its current owner, Joseph Pell Lombardi, lovingly restored, beginning in 1978. The preservation architect purchased it from the National Trust for Historic Preservation for $75,000 (equivalent to $387,300 today), with certain conditions, including stabilizing the structure and dome.\n\nIn his book, \"The Armour-Stiner (Octagon) House,\" Lombardi said his goal was \"to hold together the fragile exotic beauty of this lyrical home.\"\n\nThe 8,000-square-foot property, which was restored to its original 1870s glory, is open to the public through private tours that must be reserved in advance.\n\nTake a look inside the residence while it is decked out for a Victorian-style Christmas.\n\nThe octagonal mansion began life as a flat-roofed, two-story building with a raised basement commissioned by New York City banker Paul J. Armour.\n\nArmour died in 1866, just six years after buying the house. His widow, Rebecca, went on to sell it to Stiner for $27,000 in 1872.\n\nThe Hungarian-born businessman, who made his fortune from importing products such as tea, coffee, and cocoa, rebuilt his summer and weekend retreat in the form of an ancient classical temple with more than 20 rooms.\n\nStiner, a father of six, whose family lived in the house for only 10 years, built the 56-column veranda that surrounds the first story, resembling a fairground carousel.\n\nGuests are greeted by cast-stone lions flanking the sweeping stairs that lead to the structure, which features elaborate gas lamps and a cast-iron railing.\n\nIt allows visitors to view the grounds from every perspective, offering sun and shade depending on where they choose to sit and the time of day.\n\nTour guide Kate Mincer, who greeted our group of four at the door, explained how Stiner turned the house into a \"temple of whimsy\" by bringing in interesting motifs and designs from around the world.\n\nThe walls of the entry hall are adorned with silver leaf and stenciled decorations in trompe l'oeil neo-Baroque frames.\n\nMincer also highlighted the miniature antique Christmas tree, made from goose feathers dyed green, with traditional, hand-blown glass ornaments from Germany.\n\nStiner's wife, Hannah, impressed visitors with her immaculate salon, which featured a bay window that flooded the room with light.\n\n\"Hannah's era was the lead-up to the really showy time period of the Gilded Age,\" Mincer said. \"But this room has the kind of detail you would see in opera houses in Europe, not necessarily in private summer cottages.\"\n\nThe space features a parlor suite by the renowned 19th-century furniture maker John Jelliff, which includes two sofas, an armchair, and an armless chair designed to accommodate ladies' skirts.\n\nFor the holiday season, the Christmas tree in the salon is covered in colorful ornaments, including layered decorations crafted from embossed cardboard, foil, and paper, accented with antique trimmings.\n\nMany were handmade by Jessica Lombardi, the museum director, and a team of docents who copied the Dresden style of ornament making, which originated in Germany in the late 19th century.\n\nThe Stiners, who eventually moved into the house year-round, supported landscape painters from the 19th-century Hudson River School of Art.\n\nMost of the images are local to Irvington-on-Hudson, with views of the Palisades along the Hudson River and a particularly wide section of the river known as the Tappan Zee.\n\nAn oil canvas by Robert Havell Jr. is a 1866 depiction of the nearby Old Dutch Church, made famous by author Washington Irving's \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.\"\n\nThe dining room is the only room in the Octagon House with a rounded space, inspired by the theme of a Roman temple.\n\nIt contains a Renaissance Revival walnut dining table with semi-circular ends, adding an unusual touch.\n\nMuseum staff have meticulously set the table for Christmas Day, 1872, the year Stiner bought the property. The dining table features a menu that lists dishes such as roast goose or croquettes wrapped in bacon, finishing with plum pudding.\n\nThe silverware is Reed & Barton Roman Medallion 1870s flatware, featuring a Roman centurion's head at its base.\n\nCurrent owner Joseph Pell Lombardi discovered one of the pieces at the bottom of a dumbwaiter in 1978. It led to a two-decade search to acquire the complete set.\n\nThe triangular-shaped pantry includes original cabinets, a dumb waiter, and a soft copper sink, designed to minimize the risk of damage to crockery during the washing up.\n\nThe first-floor kitchen, with its writing desk for planning menus and a cast-iron stove, was designed for the lady of the house, despite the servants she employed.\n\nMincer explained how, within the era, the writers Harriet Beecher Stowe and her sister, Catharine Beecher, suggested that gentlewomen should take an active role in household proceedings.\n\n\"Most of the cooking was done elsewhere, but this was Mrs. Stiner's hub,\" the guide said.\n\nThe kitchen contains a selection of Joseph Stiner & Co. Importers' tea and coffee tins, including one that lists the merchant's chain of shops in Manhattan.\n\n\"At the height of his success, Mr. Stiner was basically Starbucks before Starbucks,\" Mincer joked.\n\nThe second story of the house was reserved for the Stiner family, who would relax and sleep there. It felt more cozy than downstairs.\n\nThe color palettes are softer, but the gasolier in this particular room, the former primary bedroom, is no less ornate.\n\nOne bedroom visible on the tour has a set of so-called \"cottage furniture,\" made by Hart, Ware & Co. Their designs became a fad in the mid-19th century.\n\nA more affordable type of wood, such as pine, was painted to resemble the look of ebony. The Armour-Stiner Octagon House pieces — including the bed, dresser, and side tables — come with gold filigree and river scenes.\n\nAnother interesting detail is the stretch of fabric that conceals the otherwise unattractive mechanism connecting the gasolier to the ceiling.\n\nLombardi turned one of the children's bedrooms into a curio room — basically a home museum — to reflect the Victorian obsession with natural specimens, such as mounted butterflies.\n\nIt also houses a 19th-century, patented Wooton desk with numerous drawers and nooks and crannies for ordering and storing items of interest.\n\nThe old-fashioned greeting cards are in the style of the illustrator Louis Prang, who popularized their distribution by mail. He became known as \"the father of the American Christmas card.\"\n\nMany depict flowers such as peonies and roses, while the later versions show wintry scenes trimmed with lace.\n\n\"We have images of St. Nicholas wearing purple, green, and brown instead of the iconic red suit,\" Mincer told our group, adding that Santa Claus had yet to solidify into the familiar character we now know.\n\nThe solo children's bedroom on the tour is situated on the third floor of the house. It has a homely feel with a spruce floor and porcelain doorknobs.\n\nOld-fashioned toys in the room include a teddy bear and dolls dressed in Victorian attire.\n\nLong shelves in the child's bedroom house Lionel train sets dating from 1910, depicting 1870s luxury Pullman passenger cars.\n\nThey were collected for display, along with the period lithograph prints of the actual trains, which ran on the Hudson River Railroad and were the height of luxury during the Stiners' time.\n\nMincer said the mistress of the house practiced dancing and watercolors in the high-ceilinged room with large, north-facing windows.\n\nIt contains a complete Egyptian Revival furniture set created by the prestigious New York manufacturers Pottier & Stymer, who were highly sought after in the 1870s.\n\nThe Lombardi family visited the Metropolitan Museum of Art to photograph the company's rare examples of Egyptian Revival art on display. They spent months recreating the designs to fit the suite. Its upholstery was woven in the Aubusson style.\n\nThe Egyptian Revival spinet piano brought music to the room. It is adorned with Egyptian hieroglyphics. \"The designs weren't accurate, but resembled how people from that era thought they looked,\" Mincer said.\n\nThe table opposite the piano displays a silver menorah on top, reflecting the Stiner's Jewish faith ahead of Hanukkah.\n\nThe fourth and fifth floors of the house are off-limits to visitors, partly because the steep stairs don't meet current building codes.\n\nOn a previous visit, before the code was introduced, I toured the unpartitioned dance room, which features eight windows and a spiral staircase up to the observatory. It commands beautiful views of the Hudson River.\n\nThe holiday tours take place during the day, but it's possible to see the house festively lit up at night from the Old Croton Aqueduct Trail, which borders the property.\n\nI made a quick return visit to see the exterior lights on the night of my tour and was reminded of the splendor inside.\n\nLombardi certainly stayed true to that ambitious pledge of holding \"together the fragile exotic beauty of this lyrical home.\"",

    "description": "Kylie Jenner and Timothée Chalamet walked the red carpet as a couple at the \"Marty Supreme\" premiere. They first sparked dating rumors in 2023.",
    "fullText": "Kylie Jenner and Timothée Chalamet may seem like an unexpected celebrity pairing, but the confusion appears to work in their favor: The reality star and Oscar-nominated actor have been dating for about two years and counting.\n\nHere's everything we know about their relationship so far, from secret taco dates to red carpet photo ops.\n\nRepresentatives for Jenner and Chalamet have not responded to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nCaralynn Matassa and Palmer Haasch contributed to an earlier version of this story.\n\nA video of Jenner and Chalamet from January, which showed them interacting during Paris Fashion Week, resurfaced in April as the dating rumors gained momentum. According to People, the video was taken at Jean Paul Gaultier's Paris Fashion Week show.\n\nEarlier that same month, news broke that Jenner had once again split from Travis Scott, the father of her two children, Stormi and Aire — although an anonymous source told People it was \"probably not the end\" of Jenner and Scott's famously on-again, off-again relationship.\n\nChalamet, for his part, had most recently been linked to model Sarah Talabi in 2022 and actor Eiza González in 2020.\n\nShortly before the Kymothée relationship rumors took the internet by storm, Page Six reported on March 27 that Jenner's sister, Kendall Jenner, and Kendall's then-rumored boyfriend, Bad Bunny, were photographed leaving a club together in West Hollywood, California.\n\nThe Page Six report mentioned in passing that Kendall and Bad Bunny had dinner \"alongside other A-Listers — including her sister, Kylie Jenner, and Timothée Chalamet,\" among others.\n\nOn April 6, 2023, pop-culture gossip curator DeuxMoi posted an anonymous fan submission claiming that \"multiple sources\" had told them that Chalamet \"has a new girl... Kylie Jenner.\" The anonymous sender added two coffin emojis.\n\nDeuxMoi soon followed that up with submissions from other readers who claimed they could confirm the news. One anonymous source told Deuxmoi that they'd known about the pairing since Paris Fashion Week in January, suggesting that the relationship may have begun then.\n\nA post shared by curators of pop culture (@deuxmoi)\n\nThe internet had a collective meltdown over the unexpected news, with some commenters saying they refused to believe that Jenner and Chalamet, who seem to run in very different social circles, had ever even met.\n\nPage Six and TMZ published photos from paparazzi agency Splash News, which allegedly showed Jenner and Chalamet having a \"secret date night\" at Tito's Tacos, a restaurant outside Los Angeles.\n\nPage Six reported that Jenner picked Chalamet up in her car after he attended an art show. One of Jenner's security guards then apparently drove Chalamet's car, which followed Jenner's car, to Tito's Tacos. At that point, Jenner's team hopped out and brought tacos back to the car, according to TMZ.\n\nDespite the complicated car-swap situation, Jenner's face wasn't photographed during the alleged date.\n\nOn April 13, TMZ published photos from paparazzi agency Backgrid showing a black car, which they identified as Jenner's black Range Rover SUV, in the driveway of a house, which they identified as Chalamet's Beverly Hills, California, estate.\n\nPage Six noted that the SUV had tinted windows and Jenner was never actually photographed inside the car, so it's unclear whether she was in it. The Daily Mail reported that the black SUV \"arrived around 10 a.m. and left mere minutes later,\" followed by a \"blacked out security Escalade.\"\n\nJenner famously collects luxury cars, and she has shown a preference for Range Rovers in the past.\n\nRepresentatives for Chalamet and Jenner didn't respond to requests for comment from TMZ, the Daily Mail, and Page Six at the time of the reports.\n\nEntertainment Tonight and People separately cited sources confirming the casual romance.\n\nOn April 14, People reported that \"a source close to 'The Kardashians' star\" confirmed that Jenner and Chalamet were \"hanging out and getting to know each other.\" (Representatives for Jenner and Chalamet didn't respond to People's request for comment at the time.)\n\nEntertainment Tonight reported similar information from a source.\n\n\"They are keeping things casual at this point. It's not serious, but Kylie is enjoying hanging out with Timothée and seeing where it goes,\" said Entertainment Tonight's source in a story published April 17. \"It's been really fun for her because it feels a lot different than her past relationships. It's new and exciting for Kylie and she's having a lot of fun.\"\n\nThe two both attended Coachella mid-month but avoided being photographed together, Page Six reported.\n\nAccording to ET's report, Jenner may have met Chalamet through her sister. \"Timothée is also friends with Kendall, so it's been easy for Kylie to integrate him into her life,\" the source said.\n\nPeople reported on April 19 that a source close to Jenner said she and Chalamet \"hang out every week.\" They added that Jenner is \"having fun\" and \"wants to date without any pressure\" after her on-and-off relationship with Scott.\n\nSince reports of their relationship broke, fans had been speculating that in true Kardashian-Jenner style, the couple would make their big public debut in a splashy spectacle on the Met Gala red carpet.\n\nAlas, that didn't happen. Jenner did attend the Met Gala, but she went solo, and Chalamet skipped the fashion event altogether.\n\nAfter weeks of relative silence on the Chalamet-Jenner front, a source confirmed to People that the cosmetics company founder and the \"Dune\" actor were enjoying each other's company, but not labeling their relationship. According to People's source, Jenner's main priority was being a mom to Stormi, then 5, and Aire, then just 15 months old.\n\nA few days before People published its report, Backgrid photos obtained by Page Six appeared to show the same black Range Rover (apparently Jenner's) from the April 13 sighting parked once again in the driveway of Chalamet's Beverly Hills home.\n\nOn June 1, Page Six reported that Jenner had been photographed leaving Chalamet's house for the first time. In the photos taken by Splash News, Jenner can be seen in the driver's seat of her black Range Rover, glancing at her phone before driving away from Chalamet's home.\n\nChalamet was photographed by the same paparazzo leaving in his own car shortly after Jenner departed.\n\nFootage obtained by TMZ shows the couple dancing, hugging, and kissing one another in the VIP section of Beyoncé's Renaissance World Tour at Los Angeles' SoFi Stadium. In the background, Jenner's sister Kendall is also visible.\n\nThis was the first time Chalamet and Jenner were actually seen interacting in public together. Another video of the two at the concert, obtained by PopCrave, shows Chalamet smoking a cigarette and chatting with Jenner.\n\nChalamet and Jenner were photographed together at a US Open match in September 2023. In photographs from the event, the two are shown taking in the match, whispering in each other's ears, and even sharing a quick kiss.\n\nWhile Chalamet avoided mentioning Jenner by name, or even confirming their relationship, he told GQ's Daniel Riley that the intense scrutiny around his potential relationship reminded him of a \"South Park\" episode satirizing Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, in which the couple travels around the world on a \"Worldwide Privacy Tour\" demanding space from the public eye.\n\n\"Sometimes, people are going to be hella confused when you say you're trying to live a private life,\" Chalamet said in the interview.\n\nJenner was honored at the ceremony for her work with her various lifestyle brands, including Kylie Cosmetics and Kylie Skin. Chalamet, for his part, presented an award to Martin Scorsese at the event.\n\nChalamet and Jenner sat together and were photographed smiling and talking to one another at the ceremony.\n\nAccording to People, Jenner and her mom, Kris, didn't walk the red carpet ahead of the Los Angeles premiere of \"Wonka.\" Instead, they quietly entered the theater after the opening credits.\n\nChalamet and Jenner were photographed smiling and kissing inside the awards ceremony. As users on X (formerly known as Twitter) also noted, the couple was frequently shown during the event's telecast.\n\nE! News reported that Jenner attended the after-party for the premiere of \"A Complete Unknown,\" Chalamet's Bob Dylan biopic.\n\nCiting an anonymous source, the publication reported that Chalamet was seen introducing Jenner to other members of the film's cast.\n\nChalamet brought Jenner as his date to the 82nd annual Golden Globes, where he was nominated for best performance by a male actor in a motion picture — drama, for his performance in \"A Complete Unknown.\"\n\nDuring the ceremony, Jenner and Chalamet were also photographed with his \"A Complete Unknown\" costars Monica Barbaro and Elle Fanning.\n\nChalamet was nominated for leading actor for \"A Complete Unknown\" at the 2025 BAFTA Awards.\n\nJenner and Chalamet were photographed together inside the event at the Royal Festival Hall in London. The couple coordinated in all-black outfits.\n\nChalamet and Jenner were photographed holding hands and cheering for the Los Angeles Lakers at Crypto.com Arena, where the home team took on the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nAfter going strong for about two years, Chalamet and Jenner made their red carpet debut as a couple at the 70th David di Donatello Awards in Rome, where Chalamet received an honorary award for cinematic excellence.\n\nChalamet, who grew up in New York City, is a lifelong fan of the New York Knicks. He and Jenner supported the team throughout the 2025 NBA Playoffs, often in person.\n\nAt the Knicks game on May 12, 2025, they were also joined by Jenner's sister, Kendall. On May 29, 2025, the couple sat courtside at Madison Square Garden beside Miles and Keleigh Teller.\n\nThe couple kept their sporty streak going at game four of the American League Division Series, when the Toronto Blue Jays beat the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium.\n\nFor their second red carpet appearance as a couple, Jenner and Chalamet attended the Los Angeles premiere of \"Marty Supreme\" in matching orange outfits by Chrome Hearts, a nod to the ping-pong dreams of Chalamet's character in the film.",

Scott mentioned the 2025 total, her largest giving announcement to date, in a recent blog post on her philanthropy's site.\n\nThe donations went to colleges and a range of organizations, including ones focused on the environment, women's rights, and economic security.\n\nAs of December 2025, Scott was worth $33.8 billion, according to Forbes, making her one of the world's richest women. Her $38 billion divorce settlement from her split with Bezos kicked off her journey into charitable giving. A regulatory filing showed that Scott sold 42% of her Amazon stake in 2025, totaling roughly $12.6 billion.\n\nScott's giving differs from that of many billionaires. She gives large, unrestricted donations — bucking a common belief that nonprofits can't handle this type of gift.\n\n\"Its breadth and scale are unprecedented for a donor operating outside of a foundation structure,\" Elisha Smith Arrillaga, the VP of research at the Center for Effective Philanthropy, told Business Insider. \"For years, the relative scarcity of meaningfully sized, unrestricted gifts has been a source of frustration for nonprofit leaders.\"\n\nThe size of Scott's gifts enables the nonprofit to do long-term planning. Additionally, Scott forgoes the classic application process, which can be burdensome. Instead, \"her staff takes on the bulk of the vetting,\" Smith Arrillaga said.\n\n\"It's no overstatement to say that MacKenzie Scott has revolutionized philanthropy,\" Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, the CEO of a refugee charity that received a donation from Scott, previously told Business Insider.\n\nJust two months before her divorce, Scott had signed the Giving Pledge initiative, committing to giving away half her wealth. She's given away her money at a faster pace than most other major philanthropists, according to Forbes, donating nearly $2 billion in 2022, almost $2.2 billion in 2023, and around $2 billion in 2024, according to blog posts.\n\nMelinda French Gates, the former wife of Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, said in 2022 she had \"huge respect\" for Scott's \"trust-based\" approach to philanthropy.\n\nHowever, Scott's charitable giving has drawn criticism in the past from one of the world's richest people: Elon Musk.\n\nMusk, who has been a vocal critic of DEI initiatives, criticized Scott in 2024 while replying to another X user's claims that the majority of her chosen charities were organizations that \"deal with issues of race and/or gender.\"\n\nBut the SpaceX founder's comments have appeared to have no effect on Scott's philanthropy, as she's continued to donate to diversity-related causes.",

    "description": "This summer, I went to Portugal for the music festival Afro Nation. I felt like I didn't get to see the country I'd flown all the way out to visit.",
    "fullText": "Tourism in Portugal has reached record numbers over the past two years, with over 31 million visitors in 2024.\n\nAlthough the coastal wonders of the Algarve region and the historic castles of Sintra are often a selling point for tourists, I took the seven-hour trip for reasons unrelated to wanderlust.\n\nPortimão, Portugal, is the home of Afro Nation, the biggest annual Afrobeats festival in the world — and this summer, I was one of the 40,000 festival-goers in attendance.\n\nThough dancing on the stunning beaches of Portugal to the sounds of Burna Boy and Tems live was definitely a bucket-list experience that I wouldn't have traded for the world, I'm not sure it's one I would repeat.\n\nDon't get me wrong: This realization had nothing to do with a lackluster experience. There is nothing dull about being serenaded by a shirtless Damini, and there was nothing disappointing about Portugal, either.\n\nInstead, I left feeling like I hadn't visited Portugal at all, but rather that I attended an event that just happened to be there.\n\nSomewhere between day two and day three, it hit me: I was in Portugal, but I wasn't really seeing the country.\n\nMy days weren't spent wandering tiled alleyways or eating salted cod by the water. Instead, I spent all my downtime resting at my resort, ordering food, getting dressed, and then heading back onto the beach — not for a swim, but for another 12 hours of music.\n\nThe experience wasn't exactly cheap, either. Aside from the nearly $600 I spent on the festival tickets, food and drinks were expensive at the venue, and rideshare trips cost more than I'd planned on spending, probably due to the crowds.\n\nI don't regret what I spent on the experience, but I did find myself thinking about what it would have been like to spend that money at a Lisbon flea market or on a cooking class, learning how to make pastel de nata from a local.\n\nThe beach could've been in Miami. The resort could've been in Cancún. The only Portuguese thing about my trip was the exchange rate.\n\nI did have two days after the festival ended to explore Lisbon, but it wasn't nearly enough time. I was exhausted after three days of standing on my feet and singing along, and after all of the rideshares we had purchased, both my feet and my wallet needed a break.\n\nOnce I got home, I noticed that my Instagram feed was flooded with other people's Portugal trips: sunsets on sailboats in Portimão, wine in Porto, mist hanging over Sintra's castles.\n\nI felt like they'd gotten to see Portugal. I'd gotten to see a festival that happened to be hosted there.\n\nI don't regret my trip — Afro Nation itself was unforgettable. I loved the music, the chaos, the feeling of being surrounded by a global community all singing Burna Boy under the same sky.\n\nIn an ideal world, I'd be able to go back to Afro Nation with an extra three or four days to actually roam. However, extra days meant extra costs for food, accommodations, and the experiences I was so desperate to have — and unfortunately, I didn't have unlimited PTO.\n\nI learned that my idea of a perfect trip doesn't center on an international festival or specific experience. I don't want to cross an ocean just to stand in a crowd.\n\nMy version of travel definitely includes sun, sand, and bottomless drinks, but also curiosity. I want to wander, learn, and actually see where I am.\n\nI'd say that Portugal is still on my travel bucket list — though I went, I barely touched it. Next time, I'm not going for a stage on the beach. I'm going for the country.",

    "fullText": "World War II wasn’t just fought by men and women on the front lines, it was also defined by the machines they rode, drove, and sailed into history. From towering cannons that shook the earth to massive battleships that seemed unsinkable, these vehicles weren’t just tools of war, they were icons of an era.\n\nThey carried with them the hopes of nations, the fears of enemies, and the awe of anyone who ever laid eyes on them. Today, long after their thunder has faded, these machines remain unforgettable, living on in movies, documentaries, and the collective memory of a world that witnessed the most intense conflict in history.\n\nWe’ve gathered a dozen of the most iconic, the ones that left the biggest dents not just in the battlefield, but in the imagination of generations.\n\nDuring World War II, the Germans unveiled one of the most jaw-dropping superweapons ever constructed: the Schwerer Gustav. This massive railway gun wasn’t just a piece of artillery; it was a rolling symbol of intimidation and ambition. Imagine a weapon so large it had to be transported in pieces, assembled on specially laid tracks, and required a small army of men just to operate.\n\nIts sheer presence turned heads wherever it was moved, a physical reminder of how far nations were willing to push the limits of engineering in the pursuit of victory. The Gustav wasn’t practical in the traditional sense; it was slow to move, exposed to air attack, and required enormous logistical support, but it did manage to fire upon fortified positions with shells the size of small cars. When it thundered, the earth shook, and even those far from the battlefield could feel its echo.\n\nAccording to History.com, the Japanese battleship Yamato has become a near-legend of World War II, a floating fortress that seemed almost too big to be real. Launched as the pride of the Imperial Japanese Navy, Yamato was designed to outgun anything that floated, carrying massive guns that could rain destruction over distances unimaginable for most ships of the time.\n\nBut its story is just as much about symbolism as it is about firepower. Japan built Yamato as a statement, a declaration that it would never be overshadowed on the high seas. When it sailed, it carried the weight of a nation’s pride, and its silhouette on the horizon inspired awe and dread in equal measure. Life aboard the ship was like living inside a steel city, and sailors felt both honored and burdened to serve on what was considered the ultimate warship. Yet Yamato’s greatness was undercut by the changing tides of war, where air power proved deadlier than naval guns.\n\nThe German battleship Bismarck was the terror of the Atlantic, a warship that embodied Germany’s determination to dominate the seas. When it set out, Allied sailors whispered its name with dread, knowing its guns could sink even the strongest battleships.\n\nIts most infamous moment came when it destroyed HMS Hood, Britain’s pride, in a clash that shocked the world. But this triumph only fueled the Allies’ obsession with bringing Bismarck down, sparking one of the most relentless hunts in naval history. The chase ended with the Bismarck crippled and sunk, a dramatic downfall that proved even legends could be cornered.\n\nThe Tiger I was more than just a tank; it was a monster of steel that rolled into battle like something out of a nightmare. German crews felt nearly unstoppable inside their armor, and Allied soldiers often spoke of Tigers with a mix of fear and respect.\n\nAlthough not the most numerous tank of the war, it became a symbol of German engineering and battlefield dominance. Its reputation was so fearsome that sometimes troops believed Tigers were present even when they weren’t. Stories of its invincibility spread faster than the tanks themselves, creating an aura that magnified its true impact.\n\nThe American Sherman tank wasn’t the most powerful or flashy, but it became the backbone of Allied ground forces. What made the Sherman iconic wasn’t unmatched strength, but its reliability and sheer numbers.\n\nThese tanks rolled across Europe in endless waves, a constant presence that wore down German defenses. Soldiers trusted the Sherman to get them where they needed to go, even if it wasn’t invincible against heavier armor. Its role in supporting infantry and keeping pressure on enemy positions was vital. The Sherman also carried symbolic weight as a machine that embodied America’s industrial might, producing vehicles faster than the enemy could destroy them.\n\nThe Soviet T-34 is often hailed as the tank that saved Russia, a machine built for resilience above all else. It was designed to fight in mud, snow, and harsh conditions that would have crippled more delicate machines.\n\nSoviet crews praised its toughness and mobility, and German soldiers learned to fear its sudden appearances. Unlike the Tigers, the T-34 wasn’t about prestige, it was about practicality and overwhelming numbers. It became the spearhead of massive offensives, pushing the Red Army deeper into enemy lines. Its silhouette is instantly recognizable, embodying the Soviet determination to endure and strike back.\n\nNicknamed “The Big E,” the USS Enterprise was the heart of the U.S. Navy’s carrier force during World War II. It fought in nearly every major battle in the Pacific, becoming a constant thorn in Japan’s side.\n\nSailors considered it a lucky ship, as it survived countless close calls and kept coming back stronger. Its aircraft struck decisive blows at battles like Midway, proving the aircraft carrier had replaced the battleship as the true ruler of the seas. Enterprise carried not just planes, but the morale of the Navy itself, a floating symbol of American resilience.\n\nThe British Lancaster bomber was the heavy hitter of the Royal Air Force, a night predator that struck deep into enemy territory. With its long wings and bomb bays, it could carry massive payloads and was trusted for the most dangerous missions.\n\nCrews often flew under moonlight and cloud cover, facing flak and fighters while keeping steady toward their targets. Perhaps its most famous mission was the daring “Dambusters” raid, which became a legend of ingenuity and courage. For many, the Lancaster represented Britain’s determination to hit back despite heavy losses.\n\nThe humble Jeep may not look as glamorous as a battleship or bomber, but it became one of the most beloved vehicles of the war. It was everywhere, carrying troops, hauling supplies, even serving as makeshift ambulances.\n\nSoldiers adored it for its toughness and simplicity, able to keep running through mud, sand, and rough terrain. The Jeep wasn’t about firepower, but about mobility, giving armies the ability to move fast and adapt. Its squat, boxy shape became instantly recognizable wherever Allied forces went.\n\nWhile not as intimidating as the Tiger, the Panzer IV was the true workhorse of Germany’s armored divisions. It fought in every theater of the war, proving versatile and adaptable to countless roles.\n\nGerman commanders relied on it heavily, knowing they could field it in large numbers. Its reputation wasn’t built on invincibility, but on consistency; it was always there, pushing the front lines forward. For Allied troops, facing a Panzer IV meant dealing with a determined and capable opponent.\n\nFew aircraft of World War II were as infamous as the Stuka dive bomber, its screaming sirens designed to terrify those below. German propaganda made the Stuka into a symbol of Blitzkrieg, a machine that delivered both destruction and dread.\n\nIts steep dive attacks were precise and shocking, leaving soldiers scrambling for cover. Early in the war, it seemed unstoppable, carving paths for advancing German forces. But as the skies grew more dangerous with Allied fighters, the Stuka became vulnerable.\n\nThe Soviet Katyusha rocket launcher was nicknamed “Stalin’s Organ” for the howling sound it made when firing. Mounted on trucks, it unleashed barrages of rockets that blanketed enemy positions in chaos.\n\nSoldiers described the experience as terrifying, both for those launching and those receiving the fire. Unlike traditional artillery, Katyushas could quickly move, strike, and vanish before counterattacks. Their power wasn’t in precision but in overwhelming force that rattled entire sectors.\n\nThe war ended generations ago, but the silhouettes of these machines are still etched in our minds. Whether it was the terrifying scream of a Stuka diving, the steady rumble of a Sherman column, or the towering presence of a battleship at sea, each one told a story larger than life.\n\nThese vehicles were characters in the grand part of history, and their stories remind us how innovation, ambition, and courage collided in a time of global upheaval. Today, we look back not to glorify war, but to understand how these machines became lasting legends. They are reminders of humanity’s power to build, to endure, and to remember. The steel has rusted, but the legends live on.",

    "description": "Since 1901, the Nobel Peace Prize has been awarding global strides in peace-making. The 2025 ceremony took place today.",
    "fullText": "It's been 124 years since the first Nobel Peace Prize was handed out to one of the cofounders of the Red Cross and the founder of the first French Peace Society.\n\nSince then, activists, politicians, diplomats, authors, humanitarian organizations, and political prisoners from across the world have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nThis year's winner, María Corina Machado, is the leader of the democracy movement in Venezuela, which is under autocratic rule. Her daughter, Ana Corina Sosa, attended the ceremony in Oslo on Wednesday and accepted on Machado's behalf.\n\nHere's who has won the Nobel Peace Prize every year it has been awarded, from 1901 to 2025.\n\nShelby Slauer and Melina Glusac contributed to a prior version of this article.\n\nDunant and Passy split the very first Nobel Peace Prize between the two of them.\n\nDunant won for founding the International Committee of the Red Cross in 1863. Passy received the honor for founding the first French Peace Society (Société Française pour l'arbitrage entre nations) in 1878.\n\nDucommun mainly won for his work at the International Peace Bureau, at which he served as the honorary secretary-general, but the Nobel Prize website states that, in his spare time, he \"prepared programs for international peace congresses, published resolutions, and corresponded with promoters of peace.\"\n\nGobat won \"for his efforts to bring popularly elected representatives from various countries together at meetings and congresses.\" He also knew Ducommun well — when he died, Gobat took over as the secretary-general for the International Peace Bureau.\n\nCremer was nicknamed the \"Master of Arbitration,\" which is why he received the award. Through his work with the International Arbitration League, he sought to solve conflicts through discussion, not war.\n\nThe Institute of International Law, a nongovernmental organization based in Belgium, received the 1904 Nobel Peace Prize due to its success in persuading countries to use arbitration to deal with conflict, and for convincing countries to accept the rules of law during wartime.\n\nVon Suttner was the first woman to be awarded a Nobel Peace Prize. She won for her work with the Austrian Peace Society, which she established in 1891. She also wrote one of the most influential anti-war novels, \"Lay Down Your Arms,\" in 1889.\n\nRoosevelt was the first American (and first statesman) to win the award, which he received for negotiating peace treaties in the Russo-Japanese War, ensuring its end in 1905, and resolving a dispute with Mexico using arbitration.\n\nMoneta founded the Lombard Association for Peace and Arbitration in 1887, which believed in disarmament. He also edited the newspaper Il Secolo, which regularly called for pacifism.\n\nRenault was a professor of international law. He spoke at numerous conferences, including two peace conferences at The Hague, where he solidified his place as a prominent figure in the arbitration movement. Renault was also the French government's advisor in foreign policy and international law.\n\nArnoldson won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to reconcile Norway and Sweden. He also founded the Swedish Peace and Arbitration League.\n\nBajer founded the Danish Interparliamentary Group in 1891 and was a lifelong believer in peace and arbitration. He's also been credited with laying the groundwork for the International Peace Bureau.\n\nBeernaert won the Nobel Peace Prize for \"inter-parliamentary work and [appearances] at the international peace conferences at the Hague in 1899 and 1907.\" He was also the prime minister of Belgium from 1884 to 1894.\n\nD'Estournelles also won the prize in 1909. He was the founder and president of a French parliamentary group for voluntary arbitration, and the founder of the Committee for the Defense of National Interests and International Conciliation.\n\nThe International Peace Bureau is a Swiss organization that \"campaigned for disarmament and for the use of mediation and arbitration in the solution of international disputes.\" It's still active today with 300 member organizations in 70 countries.\n\nAsser co-founded the Institute of International Law, the first organization to win the Nobel Peace Prize. But it was \"his work in the field of private law\" that was most important to his win.\n\nFried co-founded the German Peace Society and founded Die Friedenswarte, a German peace publication.\n\nRoot was both the US secretary of war and secretary of state. He was also the first president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nRoot was awarded the prize \"for having pursued the aim that conflicts between states must be resolved by arbitration.\"\n\nLa Fontaine was the first socialist to win the prize — he won for being the \"effective leader of the peace movement in Europe.\" He was president of the International Peace Bureau and \"organized a world conference for international organizations,\" whose purpose was to \"create 'an intellectual parliament' for humanity.\"\n\nThe Red Cross was the only recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize during World War I. It won because it \"undertook the tremendous task of trying to protect the rights of the many prisoners of war on all sides, including their right to establish contacts with their families.\"\n\nWilson won the prize for founding the League of Nations, which was a dream many previous winners had shared.\n\nEx-secretary of state and former president of the French parliament, Bourgeois was a major figure in the development of the League of Nations. It was his passion project to see an international court established at The Hague, which he saw through.\n\nBranting was \"a leading figure in the struggle for equal rights and social justice in Sweden\" and a strong supporter of the League of Nations.\n\nLange was also the secretary-general of the Inter-Parliamentary Union and went on to become part of the Nobel Committee in 1934.\n\nIn 1922, Nansen was appointed the first High Commissioner for Refugees, putting him in charge of the exchange of 400,000 prisoners of war. His work on their behalf, as well as on behalf of many starving refugees, won him the prize.\n\nChamberlain received his prize for his work on the Locarno Pact, an agreement that saw Germany, France, Belgium, Great Britain, and Italy guarantee peace in western Europe.\n\nUS Vice President Dawes, on the other hand, won for \"having contributed to reducing the tension between Germany and France after the First World War.\"\n\nBriand, a professor and founder of the League for Human Rights, and Stresmann, ex-high chancellor and foreign minister, split the award — they both won for their work on the Locarno Pact, which helped ease tension between France and Germany after World War I.\n\nFrench foreign minister Buisson and German professor Quidde,  who later became president of the German Peace Society, split the prize evenly — they received it for their contributions to the reconciliation of France and Germany after World War I.\n\nUS Secretary of State Kellogg received the prize for his part in initiating the Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928, an international agreement that had signatory states promising not to use war to resolve disputes.\n\nSöderblom was the first clergyman to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. The archbishop and former theology professor is credited with moving the Universal Conference on Life and Work forward, which worked to fight nationalism, racism, and the oppression of minorities.\n\nAddams, an American known as the \"mother\" of social work, received the honor for founding the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom and for being an outspoken opponent of entering World War I.\n\nButler, an American philosopher and diplomat, as well as president of Columbia University and president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, won for \"his efforts to strengthen international law and the International Court at the Hague,\" as well as his support of the Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928.\n\nAngell remains the only Nobel Peace Prize winner to have won for writing a book — he wrote \"The Great Illusion,\" which explored the relationship between war and any potential national or economic advantage it may bring about. He was also celebrated for his work as an educator and for his support of the League of Nations.\n\nBritish politician Henderson earned the prize for his work with the League of Nations, specifically for being \"one of the principal architects behind the organization's disarmament conference.\"\n\nOssietzky's win was inherently political — the German pacifist was arrested for treason when he reported that Germany was secretly rearming itself, explicitly going against the Treaty of Versailles. Part of the international campaign to get him released was awarding him the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nLamas, an Argentine academic and politician, won the prize for three main reasons.\n\nFirst, he deserves much of the credit for Argentina's joining the League of Nations. Second, he was important in the League's \"condemnation of Italy's war on Ethiopia.\" Lastly, he was honored for his contributions to peace between Paraguay and Bolivia after the Chaco War.\n\nEnglish statesman Cecil won the prize for his work with the League of Nations. He was integral to the formation of the organization's rules.\n\nThe Nansen International Office for Refugees won the prize for its work with aiding refugees, specifically for its work with Armenian refugees who were driven out of Turkey.\n\nThe organization won 16 years after their namesake, Fridtjof Nansen won as an individual.\n\nThe Red Cross won its second Nobel Peace Prize for service during World War II.\n\nHull, known as the longest-serving secretary of state — he held the position for 11 years — won the prize for his work as the \"father of the United Nations,\" an organization that was founded after World War II.\n\nMott was the head of the Young Men's Christian Association (the YMCA) and won for contributing \"to the creation of a peace-promoting religious brotherhood across national boundaries.\"\n\nBalch, an American economist and sociologist known for tackling social issues such as poverty, child labor, and immigration, became a Nobel Laureate for leading the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom.\n\nThe US, however, saw her as a \"dangerous radical.\"\n\nThese two Quaker organizations shared the prize. They both carried out humanitarian work during World War I and II, but their 1947 win was the \"Nobel Committee's recognition both of pioneering work in the international peace movement and of humanitarian work carried out without regard for race or nationality.\"\n\nOrr was president of both the National Peace Council and the World Union of Peace Organizations, and in 1945, he was elected the director-general of the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization).\n\nBunche, an academic and diplomat, was the first African-American person to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. He won it for \"having arranged a cease-fire between Israelis and Arabs during the war, which followed the creation of the state of Israel in 1948.\"\n\nJouhaux, the French trade union leader, joined the elite Nobel Laureate club for his \"work for social equality and Franco-German reconciliation.\"\n\nWriter and physician Schweitzer earned the award for founding Lambaréné, a missionary hospital, in the African country of Gabon with his wife.\n\nThe Marshall Plan is what won Marshall, the former US Secretary of State, this honor. The Marshall Plan was the US's response to the widespread devastation of World War II in Western Europe — it provided more than $15 billion to finance rebuilding projects.\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) received the prize in 1954, four years after the creation of the UNHCR. The organization was honored for its work with refugees after World War II, the cause for which it was originally created.\n\nPearson received the prize when, as Canadian secretary of state for external affairs, he found a solution to the Suez Crisis.\n\nGreat Britain, France, and Israel launched an attack on Egypt in 1956 in an effort to remove its president, without informing the United States, and Pearson won support to send a United Nations Emergency Force to separate the groups.\n\nPire, a Belgian Dominican friar, received the prize for his work with refugees in Europe. Throughout the 1950s, he set up villages of small houses for European refugees and founded an organization in 1957 that undertook development projects in other parts of the world.\n\nWhen World War I began, Noel-Baker, a British politician and diplomat, was convinced the private armaments industry was largely responsible for the outbreak of war. For the rest of his life, he worked toward disarmament, including efforts to prevent nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union.\n\nLuthuli became president of the African National Congress in 1952 and was the spokesperson of a campaign against South Africa's racial segregation policy.\n\nThe Nobel Committee's decision to award him the Nobel Peace Prize for his nonviolent campaign for civil rights in South Africa was important because it showed that the committee had joined the movement against apartheid.\n\nHammarskjöld is the only Nobel Peace Prize winner to have been awarded it posthumously. He won for his work as the secretary-general of the United Nations. He organized a peacekeeping force in the Middle East after the Suez Crisis and committed to peace during the civil war in the Congo.\n\nPauling had previously received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1954.\n\nHe received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1962 for his opposition to weapons of mass destruction, having acted as one of the primary forces behind a nuclear test ban treaty between the United States, the Soviet Union, and Great Britain that went into effect in 1963.\n\nThe Red Cross won its third Nobel Prize in 1963 for the 100th anniversary of its founding.

The ILO continues to strive to improve working conditions and social rights of employees.\n\nAmerican agronomist Borlaug is known as the \"father of the green revolution.\"\n\nHe worked for decades in Mexico during the '40s and '50s to make the country self-sufficient in grain and succeeded by 1956. He developed a strain of wheat called \"dwarf wheat,\" which was high-yielding and disease-resistant. He brought it to India and Pakistan, exponentially increasing production there.\n\nBrandt worked against the Nazis during World War II, and he became the chancellor of West Germany postwar, helping rebuild the West German Social Democratic Party.\n\nHe had West Germany sign the nuclear weapons Non-Proliferation Treaty, and created a nonviolence agreement with the Soviet Union and Poland detailing that West Germany accepted the new national boundaries in Eastern Europe.\n\nThese treaties laid the groundwork for the Four Power Agreement in Berlin, which made it easier for families on opposing sides of the divide to visit each other.\n\nWhile Vietnamese general and diplomat Le Duc Tho and American diplomat Henry Kissinger were secretly in peace talks to end the Vietnam War for years, which led to their joint Nobel prize win.\n\nHowever, Tho declined the prize, as he said that the Christmas bombing in Hanoi had violated the peace treaty that the two had agreed to.\n\nMacBride is one of the founders of Amnesty International. He also served as chairman of the International Peace Bureau in 1974 and was the assistant secretary-general of the United Nations.\n\nSato became a symbol of \"Japan's will for peace.\" As the Japanese Prime Minister, Sato signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1970.\n\nThe Nobel Committee hoped that by awarding him the Nobel Peace Prize, it would encourage those who were against the spread of nuclear arms.\n\nSakharov, a Russian nuclear physicist, was the father of the Soviet hydrogen bomb — but he was awarded the Peace Prize for his work for human rights in the Soviet Union, as well as his opposition to the abuse of power.\n\nHe was outspoken in his criticism of the system of the Soviet Union, which he believed neglected fundamental human rights.\n\nFounded in 1961 by British lawyer Peter Benenson, Amnesty International won in 1977 for campaigning against human torture.\n\nPresident Sadat of Egypt shared the prize with Israel's prime minister, Menachem Begin, for negotiating a peace treaty between their two countries.\n\nMother Teresa, known as Saint Teresa in the Roman Catholic Church, won for creating Missionaries of Charity, a sisterhood devoted to aiding orphans, lepers, and the terminally ill.\n\nEsquivel won in 1980 for being a human rights activist in his home country of Argentina and for advocating non-violence during its dictatorship in the early '70s.\n\nThe UNHCR is an international aid organization created by the UN, and it won (for the second time) for assisting refugees in Africa, Asia, and Latin America throughout the 1970s.\n\nBoth delegates in the UN, Swedish diplomat Myrdal and Mexican diplomat Robles (nicknamed \"Mr. Disarmament\"), won for advocating disarmament and nuclear-free zones.\n\nWalesa had just been released from internment — essentially, exile — when he won the Nobel in 1983 for campaigning for freedom of organization in communist Poland.\n\nAfter the country was liberated and held free elections, Walesa became the first-ever president of Poland to be elected by popular vote.\n\nDuring the height of South Africa's apartheid, Tutu, a South African Anglican cleric, won for his \"fearless stance\" and work against the cruel regime.\n\nAfter only existing for five years, this organization of doctors from around the world won for uniting to advocate against nuclear war because of its potential medical risks.\n\nAn Auschwitz survivor, writer, and professor, Wiesel devoted his entire life to speaking and writing on the horrors of the Holocaust — he was awarded for his work in 1986.\n\nPresident Sánchez of Costa Rica was awarded the Nobel Prize for designing a plan to end the civil wars that had plagued Central America for years. His efforts led to a peace treaty being approved by five countries in the region.\n\nStarting in 1948, over 500,000 UNPF members were sent to places like Kashmir, the Congo, and West New Guinea to report on conditions and administer \"humanitarian aid\" if necessary — they were awarded for years of duty in 1988.\n\nGyatso was awarded for his peaceful opposition to China's occupation of Tibet — including a plan for compromise — and for his sense of \"universal responsibility.\"\n\nAfter the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, the Cold War came to an end, and the Soviet Union soon dissolved — Gorbachev, its eighth and last leader, was awarded for ushering in this newfound international peace.\n\nBurmese politician and diplomat Suu Kyi led the nonviolent opposition to the military forces that ruled her home country of Burma for nearly two decades before she was awarded the Nobel Prize for her efforts.\n\nShe was later appointed State Counselor, a position similar to that of the prime minister.\n\nA native of Guatemala, Tum worked for the rights of indigenous peoples in America and won the Nobel for her efforts, later serving as a UN ambassador for the same cause.\n\nIn 1990, the State President of South Africa, de Klerk, released Nelson Mandela from prison, and the two negotiated an end to apartheid, laying the groundwork for a democratic South Africa — the two men shared the prize in 1993 for their historical collaboration.\n\nArafat, Peres, and Rabin shared their Nobel Peace Prize for negotiating the Oslo Accords, an agreement that was meant to be a path toward peace for Palestine and Israel.\n\nPolish physicist Rotblat and the PCSWA won for their efforts — which dated back to before the bombing at Hiroshima — to reduce nuclear arms and, eventually, eliminate them.\n\nAfter Portugal ended its colonial rule over East Timor, Indonesia took its place.\n\nThese two men — Belo, a priest, and Ramos-Horta, a diplomat — led the resistance against the Indonesian occupation of the region. They proposed a peace treaty in 1992 that was finally implemented in 2001, and Ramos-Horta claims their Nobel Prize had a lot to do with the plan coming to fruition.\n\nWilliams, an American political activist, first witnessed the horrors of land mines in El Salvador, where their explosions were a near-constant threat to civilians.\n\nShe helped launch an international campaign against land mines, and, by 1997, the ICBL had over 1,000 organizations on its members list. The two won the award the same year for their work to ban the use, production, and sale of such mines.\n\nAt the core of the Good Friday agreement, which ended the wars in Northern Ireland, were Hume and Trimble, Irish and British politicians respectively.\n\nThey won a Nobel for their historic achievement in peace-making.\n\nThis French organization — known in English as Doctors Without Borders — won in 1999 for its medically related humanitarian aid that stretched over multiple continents, which it continues to provide.\n\nPresident Dae-jung of South Korea approached relations with North Korea with what he called a \"sunshine policy,\" ending decades of war-like tension between the two countries.

The organization is dedicated to documenting the victims of Joseph Stalin's reign. According to the Nobel Prize website, the organization has \"made an outstanding effort to document war crimes, human rights abuses and the abuse of power\" and demonstrates \"the significance of civil society for peace and democracy.\"\n\nThe third honoree was the Center for Civil Liberties, a Ukrainian nonprofit. After the war broke out, the organization \"engaged in important efforts to document the forced relocation of civilians from occupied areas of Ukraine to Russia.\"\n\nMohammadi is an Iranian women's rights activist who has been vocally critical of various Iranian policies, including the mandatory hijab rule.\n\nAs the Nobel website says, she won \"for her fight against the oppression of women in Iran and her fight to promote human rights and freedom for all.\"\n\nMohammadi has been in a Tehran prison since 2021, apart from a temporary medical release in December 2024.\n\nNihon Hidankyō is a Japanese organization that was founded by the survivors of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II. These survivors are called the Hibakusha in Japan.\n\nIts mission is twofold: First, to \"promote the social and economic rights of all Hibakusha, including those living outside Japan,\" and second, to \"ensure that no one ever again is subjected to the catastrophe that befell the Hibakusha.\"\n\nThis year's Nobel Peace Prize winner was Machado, a Venezuelan politician who is vocally opposed to the current Venezuelan leader, Nicolás Maduro.\n\nShe earned the honor for \"her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy.\"",

    "description": "Bank of America predicts the classic 60/40 stock-bond portfolio mix will deliver dismal returns for investors over the next decade.",
    "fullText": "A classic and widely touted investment strategy looks poised to deliver meager returns for investors in the coming years.\n\nForecasters at Bank of America said they think the classic 60/40 portfolio — an investment portfolio split between 60% stocks and 40% bonds — was likely headed for a yearslong stretch of weak performance.\n\nThe bank predicted the classic portfolio mix would return less than 1% next year after accounting for inflation, and that the portfolio would deliver a real loss of 0.1% over the next 10 years.\n\nThat's partly because large-cap stocks in the US are likely to underperform after three consecutive years of stellar growth, the bank said.\n\n\"The math of history is tough: average returns for the S&P 500 after 3 years of >15% growth are 2.3ppt lower than the average annual return. Investors may need GDP & EPS surprises to avoid a seventh 'lost decade,'\" strategists on the bank's Research Investment Committee wrote of the 60/40 portfolio.\n\n\"Given such an uncertain core, in our view it is a great time to add 'satellite' allocations to underappreciated regions, sectors, and investment themes,\" they added.\n\nThe bank highlighted six satellite trades comprising what it thinks are the best non-consensus investing ideas going forward.\n\nInternational small- and mid-cap value stocks have seen an annual return of 15% over the last five years. That's on par with large-cap growth stocks in the US; however, international SMID companies have seen less volatility to the downside, faster earnings growth, and appear more attractive from a valuation standpoint, strategists said.\n\nQuality stocks, typically defined as companies with strong financials and low debt, have been one of the brightest spots in the US market in recent years. Stocks in the category have outperformed momentum, growth, value, dividend, and small-cap stocks, Bank of America said, citing its analysis of returns dating back to 1996.\n\n\"US high yield presents the best opportunity in credit, with higher quality than loans or private credit, and enough duration to benefit from a Fed easing cycle, according to our strategists,\" the bank wrote, adding that it expected high-yield bonds to outperform investment-grade bonds and loans next year.\n\nThe default rate on high-yield loans in the US also hovers around 2.6%, lower than the default rate on private credit and syndicated loans, strategists said.\n\nEmerging market debt has also outperformed similar investments in the fixed-income space in recent years. The asset class tends to offer investors a higher yield and has outperformed US and global bonds over the last three years, BofA said.\n\nPortfolios that include high-dividend-paying emerging market stocks have also returned around 9%-12% a year over the last five years, compared to the 5% return on the MSCI emerging markets benchmark, according to the bank's analysis.\n\n\"With 2026 expected to be the year of easing in EM, we seek income through EM debt and dividend stocks, both of which outpace common benchmarks,\" strategists wrote.\n\nThe bank expects gold to rally to $4,538 an ounce next year, implying 8% upside from current levels. That's because the factors that drove bullion's rally this year are expected to persist, strategists said, pointing to catalysts like large central bank demand and growing fiscal deficits around the world.\n\nIn a previous note, the bank also said it believed that commodities were one of the best investments in 2026 as the US economy sees strong growth, fiscal and monetary policy stimulus, and potentially hotter inflation next year.\n\nInvestors should also consider stocks that align with key themes in the market, BofA said.\n\nStrategists highlighted three investment ideas in particular that they believed had \"long-term prospects for more upside.\"\n\nGlobal X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF\n\nFirst Trust RBA Amer Industrial Renaissance ETF",

    "description": "Loitering munitions are already revolutionizing the battlefield, and the U.S. Army is finally testing launching them from its main battle tank.",
    "fullText": "General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS) has revealed more details of the ongoing efforts to arm M1A2 Abrams main battle tanks with the Switchblade series of loitering munitions, via a system known as Precision Effects & Reconnaissance, Canister-Housed (PERCH). After industry-funded trials, the company now hopes to win a U.S. Army contract for further tests of an improved version of the system.\n\nGDLS also recently released a photo showing the launch of one of the loitering munitions from a pop-up canister mounted on the tank’s turret, where it replaces the standard loader sponson box.\n\n: General Dynamics Land Systems and @aerovironment successfully demonstrate PERCH loitering munitions launcher\n\nFull release: https://t.co/Ci0WhXcOdd#ThePowerToWinpic.twitter.com/kGdWEqi5ld\n\n— General Dynamics Land Systems (@GD_LandSystems) December 5, 2025\n\nThese disclosures follow the demonstration of the PERCH system, which integrates the Switchblade 300 and Switchblade 600 loitering munitions into the M1A2 Abrams SEPv3, the latest variant of the tank in U.S. Army service. PERCH can also be integrated on Stryker 8×8 infantry carrier vehicles, and potentially other platforms. The launcher can hold three Switchblade 300s and one 600 at the same time.\n\nPERCH was developed by GDLS and AeroVironment, which produces the Switchblade, and it was demonstrated from October 26-30 at the Army’s Machine Assisted Rugged Sapper (MARS) event at Fort Hood, Texas. MARS was spearheaded by the 36th Engineer Brigade and III Armored Corps, and focused on soldiers using autonomous technology to complete breaching operations, reducing the overall risk they were exposed to.\n\nAs a modular system, PERCH is designed to be simply bolted onto an armored vehicle; in the case of the Abrams, it is fixed in place using existing attachment points. In the MARS event, PERCH was operated via a tablet interface, although GDLS says that future iterations will be fully integrated with existing vehicle computer systems.\n\nAs we have outlined in the past, the Switchblade 300 is a relatively small loitering munition, a type of weapon also often referred to as a kamikaze drone, and can carry a four-pound high-explosive warhead. It has a maximum range of just over six miles and can stay aloft for around 15 minutes.\n\nA camera in the nose allows the operator to see what the drone sees right up until near the moment of impact. The human at the controls can make course corrections and even wave off an attack entirely for any reason, up until the final moments of flight. During the final part of its terminal attack run, once locked onto its target, the loitering munition is controlled autonomously in order to hit its target even after losing connection with its controller while very low over the ground.\n\nThe larger and longer-ranged Switchblade 600 can provide long-range, higher-endurance reconnaissance and strike capabilities and is equipped with the same multipurpose warhead used in Javelin anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs). While the -300 model can go after light vehicles and personnel, the -600 can kill armor and destroy structures.\n\nBoth versions of the loitering munition have seen notable service in Ukraine, including against Russian armor.\n\nThe flexibility of the Abrams/Switchblade combo was proven at the MARS event, which saw users complete a complex obstacle breach, with the loitering munitions used for extended-range reconnaissance and over-the-horizon targeting of high-value targets.\n\n“PERCH allows units to deploy Switchblade loitering munitions far forward on the battlefield while remaining covered and concealed themselves,” explained Jim Pasquarette, vice president for U.S. strategy and business development at GDLS, in a subsequent press release. “We have seen a lot of soldier interest in this readymade, effective concept, and we look forward to future demonstrations.”\n\nProviding combat vehicles with an easily mounted, combat-proven loitering munition system is a quick way of extending their reach — and therefore their survivability. In the case of the Abrams, PERCH allows the tank to deliver precise effects through indirect fire, including engaging targets from protected positions at long distances, in which it would be unable to use its main gun.\n\nAt the same time, hosting these loitering munitions gives the tank an organic extended-range surveillance capability, meaning it can scout ahead for potential threats or other hazards without having to rely on information provided by other units. Pairing the loitering munitions with a drone relay/receiver that could stay airborne above the Abrams (even tethered to it) would provide a further benefit, extending the line-of-sight connectivity significantly, especially in complex terrain. Such a system could also provide localized overwatch and enhanced situational awareness.\n\nOverall, the appearance of PERCH is long overdue.\n\nAdding drones of this kind to armor gives them a new standoff indirect fire capability and a critical scouting tool, all in one modular and easy to use package.\n\nWhile the long-term future of PERCH with the Army is not yet determined, it is notable that, while the MARS event involved a demonstration that was funded by industry, the next phase of testing looks like it will be paid for by the Pentagon.\n\nLast week, it was reported that GDLS was in talks with the Army to provide an upgraded version of PERCH for testing in the second half of next year.\n\nAdvances planned for the new version include making it easier to reload the loitering munitions.\n\nA GDLS spokesperson told Janes that, if a deal is struck, the upgraded PERCH would be integrated into a tank as part of the 1st Cavalry Division, 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team’s Pegasus Forge exercise in the latter part of 2026.\n\nProvided that it is a success, the next evaluation could pave the way to more Army Abrams tanks getting a Switchblade loitering munition capability via the PERCH launcher.\n\nRegardless of progress with PERCH, it seems ever more likely that loitering munitions will become a standard fit on armor on the battlefields of the future.\n\nContact the author: thomas@thewarzone.com",

    "description": "EngineAI posted a video of its CEO, Zhao Tongyang, being kicked in the stomach by its T800 robot after online skeptics questioned an earlier video.",
    "fullText": "In a video posted to Instagram, EngineAI CEO Zhao Tongyang geared up in leg, stomach, and head pads. Workers taunted him, asking if he was nervous.\n\nThe company's T800 robot then appeared to kick Tongyang in the stomach, and he can be seen falling to the ground.\n\n\"Too violent!\" Tongyang said in a translation. \"Too brutal!\"\n\nA post shared by EngineAI (@engineairobot)\n\nThe video featuring its CEO came after EngineAI posted a separate video of its humanoid robot doing kicks and flips. Online skeptics made accusations that the bot in the video was CGI, so the company's next video showed the robot landing a kick to the CEO's stomach.\n\nIn a comment under its latest video, EngineAI wrote that the startup was \"curious\" what it felt like for the T800 to kick someone, so they did an \"experiment\" to find out.\n\nThe video has since amassed over 17,000 likes on Instagram. The first video, which was accused of being CGI, has over 42,000 likes. It is unclear whether EngineAI's T800 was tele-operated or moved independently.\n\nEngineAI raised $180.69 million in December 2025, per PitchBook, in a funding round led by Chinese investment groups HPR Capital, Tsinghua Holdings Capital, and Henan Investment Group.\n\n\"In 2026, the Zhongqing team will fully promote the scenario-based verification and large-scale deployment of the product,\" EngineAI commented on one of the videos. \"It will empower industrial upgrading with technological strength and reshape a new ecosystem of human-robot coexistence.\"\n\nMorgan Stanley released a list of the 25 companies it predicted would dominate the humanoid robotics market, ranging from Nvidia to Sony. The investment bank estimated the market will be worth more than $5 trillion by 2050. EngineAI was not included on Morgan Stanley's list.\n\nTesla's Optimus robot has also thrown some kicks and jabs. On the red carpet of \"Tron: Ares,\" Optimus performed Kung Fu with actor Jared Leto. On his third-quarter earnings call, CEO Elon Musk said that \"nobody was controlling\" the robot.\n\nTele-operation is still common in humanoid robots. Neo, the laundry-folding and dishwasher-filling robot that went viral on X, still requires the control of a human outside the residence as it works on training it to perform more autonomous tasks.\n\nMany Optimus bots from Tesla are tele-operated, including the ones that were bartending at an event last year. The company is moving away from tele-operation-based training and toward collecting data using only cameras, Business Insider reported in August.",

    "fullText": "The 2026 Met Gala will be here before you know it.\n\nFondly known as fashion's biggest night, the Met Gala is an annual fundraiser that supports the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute and is hosted by the museum, Anna Wintour, and Vogue.\n\nIt's always held on the first Monday in May, which will be May 4, 2026. Celebrities descend on New York City in droves for the event, showcasing their most high-fashion looks of the year on the iconic steps of the Met.\n\nThe 2026 event will support the museum's \"Costume Art\" exhibition, and a slew of A-list stars will serve as co-chairs for the gala.\n\nHere's everything we know about the 2026 Met Gala so far.\n\nA post shared by The Metropolitan Museum of Art (@metmuseum)\n\nThe exhibit and its adjacent gala have been funded this year by Saint Laurent, Condé Nast, and Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez Bezos.\n\nThe couple made their first appearance together at the 2024 event, during which Sánchez Bezos walked the carpet solo in an Oscar de la Renta gown and later met up with the Amazon founder inside.\n\nBut they're not the only stars who will be influential to the 2026 gala.\n\nEach year, a different set of co-chairs partners with Wintour on the event, and for 2026, she turned to some of the most famous women on the planet to bring the event to life.\n\nVenus Williams, Nicole Kidman, and Beyoncé — who last attended the Met Gala in 2016 — will serve as co-chairs for 2026, as Vogue announced on Wednesday. Kidman and Williams have been frequent attendees of the event in recent years.\n\nIn addition, Zoë Kravitz and Anthony Vaccarello, the creative director of YSL, are heading up the Host Committee, where they will work with a slew of stars.\n\nThey include musicians such as Doja Cat, Sabrina Carpenter, Sam Smith, Teyana Taylor, and Lisa, as well as actors like Gwendoline Christie, Lena Dunham, and Elizabeth Debicki.\n\nModels Alex Consani, Paloma Elsesser, Lauren Wasser, and Yseult are also included, as are athletes Misty Copeland and A'ja Wilson.\n\nChloe Malle, the new top editor of Vogue, and artist Anna Weyant will also join the committee.\n\nVogue has never shared many details regarding the group's duties, but they're confirmed to attend a special dinner before the gala.\n\nVogue, nor the Metropolitan Museum, has yet to announce a dress code for the 2026 Met Gala. However, it will likely be connected to the themes of the exhibition itself.\n\nIn past years, for example, attendees have worn costume-like pieces for the \"Camp: Notes on Fashion\" event, Chanel designs for the gala that honored designer Karl Lagerfeld, and pieces with religious nods for the \"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination\" gala.",

    "description": "iRobot, the company behind the Roomba vacuum cleaner, is seeing its stock on little actual news. Retail traders think they smell a short squeeze.",
    "fullText": "Retail traders love a good short-squeeze, and online chatter suggests they think the stock of the company that makes the quirky Roomba vacuum is a likely candidate.\n\niRobot, the electronics producer behind the Roomba vacuum cleaner, saw its shares surge to as high as $5.20 each on Wednesday, extending a rally of 72% since the closing bell last Thursday.\n\nThe stock is down sharply in 2025, and the recent move hasn't been sparked by any fundamental update from the company, prompting hope among retail investors that shares could be about to embark on a meme-like parabolic rally.\n\nSome of the pieces might already be in place.\n\nThe classic short squeeze formula is fairly straightforward, as it has been since Gamestop's retail-driven surge of 2021. Retail traders find a stock with high short interest and start buying up in an attempt to force short-sellers to cover their positions by buying the stock, creating yet more upward momentum.\n\nShort interest in iRobot stock is about 40% of float, which is high. On top of that, short-sellers have just 0.14 days to cover their positions, implying extremely heavy trading volume.\n\n\"Sentiment and activity levels are sitting near YTD highs, with most messages focused on the short-term technicals and momentum rather than fundamentals,\" Tom Bruni, editor-in-chief of Stocktwits, said, adding that the momentum is probably not sustainable without a fresh catalyst. \"This signals that it's primarily traders driving this move. Unless the company can capitalize on this to make its underlying business more attractive, this will fall by the wayside once the momentum fades.\"\n\nBruni said that the iRobot stock surge is likely driven by short-term interest and brand nostalgia, other hallmarks of a meme stock. Previous short-squeeze targets like, Gamestop and AMC Entertainment, also benefited from a nostalgia premium paid by investors.\n\nThe chatter on retail trader channels was building throughout the day on Wednesday as the stock rallied.\n\n\"$IRBT the gamma shorts squeeze is just starting as the hedge fund shorts still [have] no idea whats happening as the stock trembles and they get nervous here,\" one X user stated. \"This could turn out greater than $GME hiatus run up to the $300s 3 years ago.\"\n\n$IRBT needs to stay on everyone’s radar. Retail momentum is heavy, and for day traders that $4.75 trigger is the pivot. If it breaks, it funnels cleanly into the $5+ zone for straightforward profit taking.$BEAT is still holding structure with bulls firmly in control. Price…\n\n\"$IRBT shorts are playing with fire here,\" a user going by JK Capital posted. \"The squeeze seems to be in progress now… The higher this goes, the harder it squeezes.\"\n\nData from the platform that measures retail sentiment toward individual stocks ranks its users as being \"Extremely Bullish\" on iRobot.",

    "fullText": "LONDON (AP) — Scientists in Britain say ancient humans may have learned to make fire far earlier than previously believed, after uncovering evidence that deliberate fire-setting took place in what is now eastern England around 400,000 years ago.\n\nThe findings, described in the journal Nature, push back the earliest known date for controlled fire-making by roughly 350,000 years. Until now, the oldest confirmed evidence had come from Neanderthal sites in what is now northern France dating to about 50,000 years ago.\n\nThe discovery was made at Barnham, a Paleolithic site in Suffolk that has been excavated for decades. A team led by the British Museum identified a patch of baked clay, flint hand axes fractured by intense heat and two fragments of iron pyrite, a mineral that produces sparks when struck against flint.\n\nResearchers spent four years analyzing to rule out natural wildfires. Geochemical tests showed temperatures had exceeded 700 degrees Celsius (1,292 Fahrenheit), with evidence of repeated burning in the same location.\n\nThat pattern, they say, is consistent with a constructed hearth rather than a lightning strike.\n\nRob Davis, a Paleolithic archaeologist at the British Museum, said the combination of high temperatures, controlled burning and pyrite fragments shows “how they were actually making the fire and the fact they were making it.”\n\nIron pyrite does not occur naturally at Barnham. Its presence suggests the people who lived there deliberately collected it because they understood its properties and could use it to ignite tinder.\n\nDeliberate fire-making is rarely preserved in the archaeological record. Ash is easily dispersed, charcoal decays and heat-altered sediments can be eroded.\n\nAt Barnham, however, the burned deposits were sealed within ancient pond sediments, allowing scientists to reconstruct how early people used the site.\n\nResearchers say the implications for human evolution are substantial.\n\nFire allowed early populations to survive colder environments, deter predators and cook food. Cooking breaks down toxins in roots and tubers and kills pathogens in meat, improving digestion and releasing more energy to support larger brains.\n\nChris Stringer, a human evolution specialist at the Natural History Museum, said fossils from Britain and Spain suggest the inhabitants of Barnham were early Neanderthals whose cranial features and DNA point to growing cognitive and technological sophistication.\n\nFire also enabled new forms of social life. Evening gatherings around a hearth would have provided time for planning, storytelling and strengthening group relationships, which are behaviors often associated with the development of language and more organized societies.\n\nArchaeologists say the Barnham site fits a wider pattern across Britain and continental Europe between 500,000 and 400,000 years ago, when brain size in early humans began to approach modern levels and when evidence for increasingly complex behavior becomes more visible.\n\nNick Ashton, curator of Paleolithic collections at the British Museum, described it as “the most exciting discovery of my long 40-year career.\"\n\nFor archaeologists, the find helps address a long-standing question: When humans stopped relying on lightning strikes and wildfires and instead learned to create flame wherever and whenever they needed it.",

Hutchinson was also seriously injured in the crash.\n\nOf the $160,000, Hutchinson will receive a net total of $104,586.67, while the remaining funds will be used to pay attorney fees and related costs. The settlement is the final in a wrongful death suit Hutchinson filed against several Folly Beach bars and other businesses, in addition to Komoroski, who was reportedly “bar hopping” before the crash occurred.\n\nHutchinson’s attorney certified the settlement on his behalf Tuesday, according to Charleston County court records. In exchange, Komoroski is released from further civil claims.\n\nThe approval was filed after the settlement approval hearing on Monday, Dec. 8.\n\nA judge previously approved settlements from The Drop-In, the Crab Shack, and Snapper Jacks alongside settlements with Progressive Auto Insurance and Enterprise Rent-A-Car during a motion hearing on June 18, 2024, according to attorneys representing Hutchinson.\n\nTaco Boy not liable for bride’s death in Folly Beach DUI crash\n\nThe previous settlements totaled more than $863,300, which were awarded to Hutchinson.\n\nKomoroski was sentenced in connection with the crash on Dec. 2, 2024, to 25 years for the charge of felony DUI resulting in death, which is the maximum sentence for the charge.",

    "fullText": "JD Vance appears to be no fan of the viral “6-7” craze.\n\nIn a social media post on Tuesday, the vice president said his 5-year-old son, Vivek, “went absolutely nuts” at church when the Bible readings happened to fall on pages 66–67 of the missal.\n\nPolitics: Trump's Bathroom Moment Aboard Air Force One Has Critics Flush With Jokes\n\nThe child repeated “‘six seven’ like 10 times,” Vance wrote.\n\n“And now I think we need to make this narrow exception to the First Amendment and ban these numbers forever,” he said.\n\nYesterday at church the Bible readings started on page 66-67 of the missal, and my 5-year-old went absolutely nuts repeating \"six seven\" like 10 times. And now I think we need to make this narrow exception to the first amendment and ban these numbers forever.\n\n— JD Vance (@JDVance) December 10, 2025\n\nIn a follow-up post, Vance asked of the trend, “Where did this even come from?

Extended reality—virtual reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality—bridges this gap by letting people learn through immersive, emotionally engaging, hands-on experiences that the brain encodes like real events. Organizations from Bank of America to Boeing to Walmart are already seeing faster learning, higher confidence, reduced errors, and lower costs by using XR to train employees in everything from customer-service scenarios to technical assembly. The technology works because it aligns with how people actually learn, benefits from major improvements in affordability and accessibility, and meets the expectations of a workforce already accustomed to immersive digital environments. The companies that start with focused pilot projects, match the right XR tool to the right skill gaps, and scale deliberately will build training systems that actually change behavior and materially improve performance.",

    "description": "A split central bank leaves Wall Street watching every word as inflation and missing data collide.",
    "fullText": "This article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nFederal Reserve officials are set to push through a third consecutive rate cut on Wednesday, yet the debate inside the central bank could be more intense than the headline suggests. After trimming rates twice this autumn and by 1.5 percentage points over the past 15 months the Fed is inching toward levels that could stimulate economic activity, something many policymakers would prefer to avoid. A growing number of officials believe the benchmark may now be sitting at a neutral level that neither accelerates nor restrains growth, creating the possibility of a more divided outcome and, according to several analysts, as many as three dissents.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with AMZN.\n\nIs AMZN fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nThe shutdown that consumed October and most of November has left Powell without timely data to guide the next narrative. Investors will be watching closely as officials release a fresh statement on Wednesday, where the Fed could reiterate that labor-market risks have risen in recent months while inflation remains somewhat elevated. Powell must navigate a wide spectrum of views when he speaks at his press conference, especially with consumer spending showing little change in September and layoffs declining overall, despite high-profile cutbacks from companies including Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ). Without updated economic readings until mid-December, Powell may have limited room to commit to any firm path forward.\n\nEconomists increasingly think policymakers will pause after this week's move while they evaluate incoming data, and the committee's new projections could underscore just how split the outlook has become. In September, eight officials favored stopping cuts at levels expected after Wednesday's decision, while nine signaled at least two more in 2026. The median outlook could adjust growth for 2025 slightly higher, trim inflation estimates for the end of this year, and nudge unemployment forecasts upward. Powell faces a more fragmented committee, with several regional presidents arguing against further reductions and Fed Governor Stephen Miran expected to dissent again in favor of a larger half-point cut. Investors are now looking toward the White House, where President Donald Trump is weighing his choice to succeed Powell when his term expires in May, and Kevin Hassett is widely viewed as a leading contender.",

    "description": "Scientists have discovered the oldest-known evidence of fire-making by prehistoric humans in the English county of Suffolk - a hearth apparently made by Neanderthals",
    "fullText": "Dec 10 (Reuters) - Scientists have discovered the oldest-known evidence of fire-making by prehistoric humans in the English county of Suffolk - a hearth apparently made by Neanderthals about 415,000 years ago - revealing that this milestone for our evolutionary lineage occurred far earlier than previously known.\n\nAt an old clay pit ​for making bricks near the village of Barnham, the researchers found a patch of heated clay, some heat-shattered flint handaxes and two pieces of iron pyrite - ‌a mineral that creates sparks when struck against flint to ignite tinder - that they identified as a repeatedly used campfire.\n\nIt was situated near a watering hole where these humans encamped.\n\n\"We think humans brought pyrite to the site ‌with the intention of making fire. And this has huge implications pushing back the earliest fire-making,\" said archaeologist Nick Ashton, curator of Palaeolithic Collections at the British Museum in London and leader of the research published on Wednesday in the journal Nature.\n\nUntil now, the earliest-known evidence of fire-making was from about 50,000 years ago at a site in northern France, also attributed to Neanderthals.\n\nThe controlled use of fire was a landmark event for the human evolutionary lineage, not only for cooking and providing protection from predators but for providing warmth that enabled hunter-gatherers to thrive ⁠in areas with colder environs.\n\n\"Places like Britain, for example,\" British Museum ‌archaeologist and study co-author Rob Davis said.\n\nThrough cooking, our forerunners were able to eliminate pathogens from meat and toxins from edible roots and tubers. Cooking made these foods more tender and digestible, freeing up bodily energy from the gut to fuel development of the brain.\n\nBeing able to ‍consume a greater range of foods supported better survival and allowed for feeding larger groups of humans, according to the researchers.\n\nFire also may have contributed to social evolution. The use of fire at nighttime allowed these humans to gather and socialize, perhaps engaging in storytelling and developing language and belief systems.\n\n\"The campfire becomes a social hub,\" Davis said.\n\n\"We're a species who have used fire to really shape ​the world around us,\" Davis said, noting that the new findings show that this trait is something our species Homo sapiens has in common with the Neanderthals and possibly ‌other large-brained human relatives living at that time like the Denisovans.\n\nThe Palaeolithic, or Old Stone Age, site at Barnham dates to before the earliest-known Homo sapiens fossils in Africa.\n\nThe researchers believe that Neanderthals, our close evolutionary cousins, were the fire-makers, another piece of evidence showing the intelligence and ingenuity of these archaic humans long maligned in popular culture.\n\nPaleoanthropologist and study co-author Chris Stringer said no human fossil remains were found at the Barnham site.\n\nBut Stringer noted that pieces of a human skull about 400,000 years old characteristic of a Neanderthal were found in the mid-20th century less than 100 miles (160 km) to the south at a town called Swanscombe. Stringer said the Swanscombe skull fragments match Neanderthal fossils from a site ⁠called Sima de los Huesos, meaning \"Pit of the Bones,\" near Burgos in Spain, dating to about 430,000 ​years ago.\n\n\"Thus the Barnham fire-makers were very likely to have been early Neanderthals, like Swanscombe and the Sima ​people,\" Stringer said.\n\nNeanderthals went extinct roughly 39,000 years ago not long after Homo sapiens swept through the European territory they called home. Their legacy lives on in the genomes of most people on Earth, thanks to interbreeding between Homo sapiens and Neanderthals before their disappearance.\n\nPrevious archaeological work at ‍the site has given scientists a good understanding ⁠of what the place was like at the time the hearth was made, with a rich array of animals from elephants to smaller mammals and birds, and evidence of human activity in the form of cut marks on animal bones.\n\nThere is archaeological evidence from Africa dating to more than a million years ago of humans ⁠using naturally occurring fire - from wildfires or lightning strikes - but those sites lacked evidence of deliberate fire-making.\n\nThe researchers spent four years conducting tests to show that the evidence from Barnham was of deliberately made fire. They ‌said numerous pieces of evidence demonstrated this including geochemical testing that revealed there had been temperatures of more than 700 degrees Celsius (1290 degrees Fahrenheit) with ‌repeated fire-use in the same location.",

    "fullText": "A recent update to an online tool that tracks sea level rise in Hawai'i could help local communities prepare to face growing threats.\n\nSea levels have risen around the globe by an average of eight to nine inches since 1880, but island and coastal communities are especially vulnerable to the threats posed by encroaching waters.\n\nIn an effort to prepare the archipelago of Hawai'i for destructive storm surges, floods, erosion, and more, the state's Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Commission has updated its Sea Level Rise Viewer. The online tool tracks rising seas.\n\nA news release from the Hawaiian Department of Land and Natural Resources declared that the revamped tool will help support \"smarter coastal planning.\" The tracker projects that Hawai'i will face sea level rise of up to four feet by the end of the century.\n\n\"Sea level rise isn't a distant forecast,\" state climate coordinator Leah Laramee said in the release. \"It's happening now and its impacts are already being felt across Hawai'i.\"\n\nAccording to the U.S. Earth Information Center, even if the rise in global temperatures driven by human activity were to be stopped overnight, sea levels would continue to increase for centuries due to the damage already done by heat-trapping pollution.\n\nBurning dirty energy sources like oil, coal, and gas has contributed to temperatures rising globally by 1.9°F since 1880, with the majority of that increase happening over the last 50 years. These higher temperatures can cause glaciers to melt and sea levels to rise.\n\nExtreme weather has always existed, but scientists agree that human-induced warming is supercharging these events. With stronger, more destructive storms, tsunamis, and flooding, infrastructure and communities are put at risk — especially those along coastlines.\n\nSome people are moving to inland and mainland communities to escape encroaching ocean waters and their effects. Sadly, the most vulnerable and historically marginalized populations are too often left behind. Indigenous island communities can be disproportionately impacted, not only in Hawai'i but also around the globe.\n\nTogether with improving equitable support for climate-based migrations, local governments and groups can implement infrastructure such as \"living shorelines\" to help absorb wave action and prevent coastal damage. But experts agree it's also vital that we move away from burning fossil fuels and toward renewable, sustainable energy sources to tackle the root cause of rising seas.\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nIt is hoped that Hawai'i's updated tool can be used to help tailor related policies across the state. \"We need tools like the Sea Level Rise Viewer to make informed planning and policy decisions,\" Laramee said in the release.\n\nShe continued, \"These updates give our communities and leaders clearer, more actionable information so we can plan smarter, protect people, and respond to the realities unfolding along our shores.\"\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Pregnant immigrants in ICE monitoring programs are avoiding care, fearing detention during labour and delivery\n\nIn early September, a woman, nine months pregnant, walked into the emergency obstetrics unit of a Colorado hospital. Though the labor and delivery staff caring for her expected her to have a smooth delivery, her case presented complications almost immediately.\n\nThe woman, who was born in central Asia, checked into the hospital with a smart watch on her wrist, said two hospital workers who cared for her during her labor, and whom the Guardian is not identifying to avoid exposing their hospital or patients to retaliation.\n\nThe device was not an ordinary smart watch made by Apple or Samsung, but a special type that US Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) had mandated the woman wear at all times, allowing the agency to track her. The device was beeping when she entered the hospital, indicating she needed to charge it, and she worried that if the battery died, ICE agents would think she was trying to disappear, the hospital workers recalled. She told them that, just days earlier, she had been put on a deportation flight to Mexico, but the pilot refused to let her fly because she was so close to giving birth.\n\nThe woman’s fear only grew from there, according to the hospital workers. Her delivery wasn’t progressing the way the care team hoped, and she needed a C-section, a procedure that requires doctors to use a cauterizing tool to minimize bleeding. To prevent possible burning and electrocution, patients are instructed to take off all jewelry or metals before the surgery. The mandatory watch had no way to be easily removed, nor was information about whether it would be safe to wear during the procedure readily available. Hospital staff didn’t know how to contact ICE to ask what to do. When hospital staff told the woman they might have to cut the smart watch off, she panicked, the workers said.\n\nStaff eventually did remove the device, and ICE agents did not show up at the hospital during the delivery. The nurses said they do not know what happened to the woman after she left the hospital with her baby.\n\nThe woman was one of three pregnant patients wearing a location-tracking smart watch whom these two workers encountered in their ER in the last few months, they said.\n\nThe watches are built and operated by BI Inc, a company specializing in monitoring tech that runs the US government’s largest immigrant surveillance operation. The program, Alternative to Detention (ATD), allows select immigrants to await their day in court at home rather than in detention, provided they \n\nWhen immigrants are enrolled in ATD, they are assigned one or more types of supervision. Some have to wear an ankle monitor, some a smart watch. Some are required to complete regularly scheduled facial recognition scans at their home using a BI Inc app, others are mandated to go into a BI Inc or ICE office for regular in-person check-ins.\n\nThe smart watch, officially called the VeriWatch, was introduced two years ago by BI Inc. It was first piloted under the Biden administration and framed as a more discrete alternative to the less digitally equipped ankle monitor, which BI also manufactures and supplies to ICE. As the Guardian previously reported, immigrants wearing the ankle monitors have complained about the stigma that comes with wearing the conspicuous device as well as physical pain caused by the monitors, including electric shocks and cuts from devices that are strapped on too tightly.\n\nNearly 200,000 people are currently enrolled in the program, and many of them have become increasingly fearful of being considered out of compliance as the Trump administration works to deport immigrants en masse. There have been several cases of people in the program showing up to a mandated, regular in-person check-in with immigration officials, believing they will continue in the ATD program, only to be detained.\n\nAll three women encountered by the Colorado hospital staff were reluctant to take their monitors off, fearing that doing so would trigger an alert to ICE or BI Inc, the staff said, even if removing the device was deemed medically necessary.\n\nOne of the women went into the ER for a C-section and was diagnosed with preeclampsia, a complication that can cause significant swelling. Staff were worried her smartwatch would cut off her circulation.\n\n“She was in tears about it. She had this deep fear that ICE was going to come to the hospital and take her baby,” one of the staff said. The hospital worker’s shift ended before the patient underwent the C-section. They said they do not know whether the staff who took over the patient’s case convinced her to cut off the watch.\n\nThe confusion and fear surrounding the wrist monitor caused delays in the hospital’s ability to provide adequate and necessary care for these women, the workers said, though the patients delivered their babies safely.\n\n“Waiting and trying to figure these things out even when things are not super emergent can cause something emergent to happen,” one of the workers said. “Sometimes in birth, doing a C-section 20 minutes before something bad happens can prevent it.”\n\nThe workers pointed out that when they treat patients wearing a monitor issued by the state Department of Corrections, there is a protocol in place to remove it ahead of medical procedures.\n\nHospital staff from across the US who spoke to the Guardian say the confusion brought on by monitoring devices is just one of several ways Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown is affecting medical care, and comes as immigrant patients are increasingly fearful of seeking out treatment.\n\nOne of the staff at the Colorado hospital said she’s had at leastthree pregnant patients show up for their first-ever prenatal appointment at anytime between 34 and 38 weeks – well into their third trimester and long after pregnant women are recommended to begin going to consistent doctor appointments.\n\nIn California, hospital workers have also noticed a drop this year in immigrants not just seeking emergency care but also showing up for regular doctor visits or vaccinations, according to the California Nurses Association president, Sandy Reding.\n\n“Obviously it has a cascading effect,” Reding said. “If you don’t see your doctor regularly then the outcomes are worse and you wait until you have a crisis to go to the ER.”\n\nIn Chicago, CommunityHealth, one of the largest volunteer-based health centers in the country, documented an overall drop in visits per patient and patient retention between 2024 and 2025 due to immigration enforcement activity in the city. In June, the organization observed a 30% dip in patients showing up for their appointments and around a 40% drop in patients picking up their medication since Trump took office.\n\nNeither ICE nor BI Inc responded to requests for comment. ICE previously told the Guardian that there is no evidence the ankle monitors have caused physical harm and that the ATD program was effective at increasing court appearance rates among immigrants facing removal.\n\nThe lack of procedure to have ankle or wrist monitors removed in medical emergencies has affected more than just pregnant women. In one July 2025 case, ICE responded to a man’s request to remove his ankle monitor because of a medical issue by detaining him, according to a court petition filed on his behalf by immigrant rights group Amica, which the Guardian reviewed.\n\nThe man came to the US from Bangladesh to seek political asylum, and was told he had to wear an ankle monitor while his claim was pending. Suffering from nerve damage in one leg, he obtained a note from a medical clinic requesting the monitor be removed. His lawyer sent the note to the ICE officer on the case but never heard back. During his first check-in at the BI offices, the man brought the medical note to the BI Inc employee assigned to the case, who suggested the man might be able to move the ankle monitor to his other leg. But after the man’s lawyer called ICE to inquire about moving the ankle monitor, the BI case manager informed the man that ICE officers were coming to the BI office to speak with him. They arrested and detained the man, according to the petition.\n\n“He explained that he was just asking for the ankle monitor to be put on the other leg, and the officer told him it was ‘too late’,” the petition reads.\n\nIn 2009, ICE discontinued the use of ankle monitors for pregnant women and people whose medical conditions made it “inappropriate” to wear them. But former BI Inc staff as well as immigrants rights groups Amica and American Friends Services Committee said they are concerned that these exceptions are not always enforced. That exception also doesn’t apply to smart watches, a June 2025 ICE memo shows.\n\nThe ICE memo instructs agency staffers to put ankle monitors on anyone enrolled in ATD. Dawnisha M Helland, an ICE acting assistant director in the management of non-detained immigrants, wrote that the only group who would not be given ankle monitors were pregnant women. Instead, pregnant women in ATD would wear the smart watch.\n\nThough it resembles a typical consumer smart watch, the VeriWatch is not less restrictive than the ankle monitor. Like the ankle monitor, the wrist watch can’t be removed by the person wearing it. ICE had the option of using a removable version of the watch, according to a 2023 request for information DHS published. The agency chose a different direction; it currently only uses a watch that cannot be removed except by an ICE or authorized BI agent, according to two former DHS officials and two former BI employees.\n\nImmigrants in the program are not told what to do with their ankle or wrist monitors in case of medical emergencies, and BI staff were not authorized to approve the removal of the monitors without first speaking to ICE, the two former BI Inc. staff recalled.\n\nThere’s not always time in emergency cases to wait for approval from ICE to cut off the monitors, the Colorado hospital workers said. One of the Colorado staff said they’re deeply concerned about how this unremovable watch will continue to impact vulnerable pregnant women.\n\n“They’re looking at people who literally can’t speak up, who have no legal resources, who are not American citizens, and are pregnant. They’re asking themselves what they can get away with in terms of violating civil liberties for these patients,” the employee said. “That’s the true pilot program: How far can they overreach?”\n\nHealthcare workers are not the only ones sounding the alarm over surveillance’s interference with medical care. Two former Department of Homeland Security officials told the Guardian that the lack of protocols for immigrants surveilled under ATD with exigent medical issues is a symptom of a larger issue with the way BI Inc and ICE run the program. As the Guardian previously reported, immigrants surveilled under ATD and BI Inc employees alike have long complained that the program is highly discretionary. They said that many of the decisions about how, why or how long a given person was mandated to wear an ankle monitor or a smart watch were left to individual case workers.\n\nBI Inc, which started off as a cattle monitoring company, and its parent company the Geo Group, which develops detention centers, private prisons, and rehabilitation facilities, have been given the exclusive DHS contract to operate all aspects of the ATD program since its inception in 2004. That’s despite previous attempts by ICE leadership under Joe Biden’s administration to break the contract up into three parts rather than awarding the entirety of the contract to Geo Group, a company that has served as a landing spot for former ICE and DHS officials.\n\nAt its peak, BI Inc monitored approximately 370,000 immigrants under the Biden administration as part of a policy that put every head of household crossing the border on ATD. The tally decreased in 2025 to about 180,000 people, due in part to high costs of putting so many people on ATD, former DHS officials said. As Trump’s second administration supercharged immigration enforcement and greenlit a $150bn surge in funding for ICE, though, Geo Group executives expressed confidence they could reach the same height by the second half of 2025. The goal, the executives have said, is to monitor all 7.5 million people listed on the federal government’s non-detained docket, the list of non-citizens who have not been detained but are subject to removal.\n\nHowever, the Trump administration has focused on deportation and detention rather than monitoring, and the number of immigrants enrolled in ATD and wearing ankle monitors or other GPS tracking devices has hovered around 180,000, much to the dismay of Geo Group executives.\n\n“Now the count has been fairly stable, which is a little disappointing, obviously,” George Zoley, the GEO Group founder and executive chairman of the board, said during the company’s November earnings call.\n\nICE awarded another two-year-contract to BI Inc to manage ATD in September. Executives have said they’re pleased that the agency is prioritizing using the company’s more expensive ankle monitors on those immigrants already in ATD rather than the more cost-effective tools like the company’s facial recognition app, Smart Link.\n\nUnder the Biden administration, several departments within DHS attempted to address the lack of consistent policy around how ICE should run ATD. In December 2022, DHS hosted 100 non-governmental organizations as well as members of academia and private industry to discuss how to bring more “uniform standards to govern” ATD. That two year effort to draft guidelines in a document, initially titled Non-Detained Management Standards, was ultimately scuttled by ICE and BI, said Scott Shuchart, a former assistant director for regulatory affairs and police at ICE under the Biden administration. Another former DHS official confirmed his account. The draft standards were never made public.\n\n“The program is really structured for the benefit of BI and not for the benefit of the non-citizens who were going to be managed through it,” said Shuchart. “Therefore ERO [ICE’s enforcement and removal arm] was extremely resistant to bring rationalization and consistent policy into it.”",

    "fullText": "Buying the Zombies, Run! studio wasn’t part of ​my plan, but a post-apocalypse ​game with stories that make people feel seen pulled me in\n\nDon’t get Pushing Buttons delivered to your inbox? \nA few days ago, I clicked a button on my phone to send funds to a company in Singapore and so took ownership of the video game I co-created and am lead writer for: Zombies, Run! I am a novelist, I wrote the bestselling, award-winning The Power, which was turned into an Amazon Prime TV series starring Toni Collette. What on earth am I doing buying a games company?\n\nWell. First of all. Zombies, Run! is special. It’s special to me – the game started as a Kickstarter and the community that grew up around it has always been incredibly supportive of what we’re doing. And it’s special in what it does. It’s a game to exercise with. You play it on your smartphone – iPhone or Android – and we tell stories from the zombie apocalypse in your headphones to encourage you to go further, faster, or just make exercise less boring. Games are so often portrayed as the bad entertainment form, but I made a game that fundamentally helps people to be healthier.\n\nThe experience of playing Zombies, Run! is also completely focused on storytelling. My co-creator Adrian Hon and I were talking about doing a project together. He said: “Let’s do something to make running more fun.” I said: “How about if we do a story where you’re being chased by zombies?” And here we are.\n\nWhen you play the game, you’re immersed in a world where every run makes you a hero – you’re collecting supplies, saving a child from no man’s land, investigating the mystery of how the apocalypse started. I’ve always focused on the storytelling being good. And it works. Players of the game become so attached to the characters that many of them report laughing out loud or even “crying while running”.\n\nOne of my jokes about storytelling in video games is that the way we tend to talk about it – in the games industry, in games journalism, even in marketing copy – is very much “never mind the quality, feel the width”. We say things like “this game has 100-plus hours of story” or “this game contains more than a million words”. Imagine marketing a movie saying that the script contains 29,000 words. Or selling a novel on the basis that it’ll take a long time to read.\n\nThat’s not how you do it. You tell the story. You give a hook. You say: “A single woman comes home one evening to find a man claiming to be her husband living in her house. And when he goes up to the attic, a different husband comes down in his place.” Now you can’t wait to find out what happens next. (That, incidentally, is the brilliant comic novel The Husbands by Holly Gramazio – who I think is the only other bestselling novelist to be also making her own video games.)\n\nSo, now I own a games company, what am I going to do? My feeling is that I must focus on the fundamentals. There’s a world of games out there that thinks it can replace writers with AI large language models. I think that’s going to make writing worse and worse. AI writing is fine for boilerplate text that is always roughly the same. It’s fine for non-writers to get their expertise into the world. But storytelling is different. It is human minds finding companionship with other human minds – we need stories, fundamentally, to feel less alone. To know that other people have been through things a bit like what we have. Things that make us laugh, and cry, even while running. You get that from work that is not the same as everything else, you get it from the unique work of other individual human minds.\n\nAnd actually, Zombies, Run! has always been a universe with strong values. We’re not a rightwing, rugged-individualism apocalypse, where one lone person can get through with just their guns. In our world – as in the real world – humans survive by working together.\n\nWhile we’re still going to have many exciting fleeing zombies, battling-the-undead storytelling, I think there’s probably also room in the ZR! universe for a 10-mission arc where you have to find all the figurines and paints you need to complete an expansion set in “Demons and Darkness”; or one where you’re working on bringing an overgrown garden back to blooming, beautiful life; or setting up and running the first post-apocalyptic travelling library while also trying to work out what happened to the first librarian who’s mysteriously disappeared, leaving only a series of cryptic notes in an old manuscript.\n\nAfter all, I do think this is quite a good time in the world to be thinking about how to rebuild after a series of catastrophic events.\n\nSelling story by the yard and not by a story hook is a marker, I think, of a lack of confidence in the form. We don’t need to lack confidence. Games are the biggest entertainment industry in the world. If we want to be taken seriously, we need to take ourselves seriously. Stop talking about the width, start talking about the quality.\n\nIt was the 20th anniversary of Xbox 360 recently, and one name that’s cropped up in every list of the console’s best games is the compulsive retro twin-stick shooter Geometry Wars. If you’re yearning for something similar, you must immediately download Evil Egg, a frenzied twin-stick blaster with gorgeous Commodore 64-style visuals and sound effects. Shoot everything that moves, hit the left trigger to boost and collect hearts to stay alive.\n\nAt first it’s a bewildering mass of rainbow pixels but as you detonate wave after wave of glitchy space pests, you begin to understand the patterns of different enemies and earn upgrades such as the executioner’s sword, which takes out foes in an orbital slash of laser particles. Evil Egg is polished, exciting, wild to look at, and has such a brilliant understanding of the genre and its unique dynamics. It’s free on Steam but I implore you to download it on Itch.io and name your own price. Keith Stuart\n\nAvailable on: PC\n\n Estimated playtime: 10-plus hours\n\nThere has been a lot of writing about Horses, the art game recently banned by digital platforms Steam and Epic Games Store. I particularly enjoyed this post by writer Harper Jay MacIntyre, which considers Horses, formalism and the trans experience. The article manages to bring in so many elements of modern games criticism and academia while providing a highly personal response to the game.\n\nThe most interesting retro game articles are the ones that reassess lost or derided titles rather than merely celebrate the classics. Was the Atari 2600 version of Pac-Man the worst game ever? Not according to this compelling analysis from Garrett Martin at AV Club who sees it as a misunderstood brutalist gem. I find myself in agreement.\n\nIt is also nice to see a legendary game justly praised in an interesting way. The BFI’s look at the legacy of Time Crisis considers the gun game in relation to cinema, referencing Beverly Hills Cop and Run Lola Run rather than just comparing it to Sega’s similar Virtua Cop.\n\nSkate Story – hellish premise aside, this is skateboarding paradise | ★★★★☆\n\nHorror game Horses has been banned from sale – but is it as controversial as you’d think?\n\nFive Nights at Freddy’s 2 – inept game-based horror is one of the year’s worst | ★☆☆☆☆\n\nThis one comes from reader, Rebecca:\n\n“My elderly grandad is coming to stay with us for Christmas and wants to see what’s happening with video game graphics these days. Are there any titles you recommend that will let him explore beautiful locations without getting shot at?! We have a PlayStation 5 and a slightly out-of-date PC.”\n\nYour best option here is to go with one of the big open-world adventures and just find an area with no enemies around. If you You could bypass the threat of imminent violence completely by going for a driving game, such as Forza Horizon 4 on PC (which is set in Britain so he may even spot some familiar scenery). Alternatively, if visual realism isn’t as important as beauty, a cosier indie title such as Tchia, Journey or Firewatch may fit the bill. Really hope he enjoys them!\n\nWe’re still looking for your game of the year nominations for an end of year special – let us know yours by hitting reply or emailing us on pushingbuttons@theguardian.com.",

    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nChina continues to make big advances in the final frontier.\n\nThe nation just launched three Long March rockets in less than 19 hours, setting a new national mark for liftoff cadence.\n\nIn addition, the trio pushed China's orbital-launch tally for 2025 to 83, extending another record. The previous yearly high for the country, set last year, was 68. (Eighty-three is not a global record, however; SpaceX has launched 159 orbital missions in 2025 so far by itself.)\n\nThe flurry began Monday (Dec. 8) at 5:11 p.m. EST (2211 GMT), when a Long March 6A rocket lifted off from Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center in northern China. That mission successfully sent a batch of broadband satellites to low Earth orbit for the Guowang (\"national network\") megaconstellation.\n\nThen, at 10:41 p.m. EST on Monday (0341 GMT on Tuesday, Dec. 9), the mysterious Yaogan 47 spacecraft took flight atop a Long March 4B from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the Gobi Desert. Yaogan 47 is a classified satellite that will be used by the Chinese military.\n\nThe tripleheader wrapped up on Tuesday at 10:08 a.m. EST (1508 GMT) with the launch of another classified satellite, known as TJSW-22, on a Long March 3B from Xichang Satellite Launch Center in western China.\n\nAll three of these launches took place on Tuesday Beijing time, as noted by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), the state-owned entity that operates the Long March family of rockets.\n\n\"This was the third successful launch of China's Long March rockets today, setting a new record of three launches in one day,\" CASC officials said in a statement on Tuesday, referring to the TJSW-22 liftoff (in Mandarin; translation by Google).\n\nA total of five orbital launches have now occurred in the 24-hour stretch beginning with Monday's Guowang liftoff. The other two were SpaceX Falcon 9 missions — a Monday evening flight lofted a batch of the company's Starlink satellites and the NROL-77 launch for the U.S. National Reconnaissance Office happened on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThat's not a 24-hour record, however: Between April 28-29 of this year, six different rockets launched toward orbit in a span of just 18 hours — a Long March 5B, two Falcon 9s, a United Launch Alliance Atlas V, an Arianespace Vega C and Alpha, a vehicle built and operated by Texas-based company Firefly Aerospace. All but Alpha were successful.",

In case you missed it, the December free games for PS Plus subscribers--Lego Horizon Adventures, Killing Floor 3, The Outlast Trials, Synduality Echo of Ada, and Neon White--are also available to claim, so make certain to do so before January 5, 2026.\n\nIf you're curious to see just how much time you spent playing games this year, you can also check out the 2025 PlayStation Wrap-Up for a breakdown on which games you were focused on.\n\nFirst released in 2023, Assassin's Creed Mirage was billed as a return to the stealth-focused roots of the series. Set in ancient Baghdad, the game follows Basim Ibn Ishaq after he is recruited into the Hidden Ones and joins the fight against the Order of the Ancients.\n\nDeveloped by Team Ninja--the studio behind the Nioh games and co-developer of Ninja Gaiden 4--Wo-Long: Fallen Dynasty is a fast-paced action game with parry-based combat that'll appeal to Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice fans. Set during China's Three Kingdoms period of history, the game puts a dark fantasy and souls-like spin on this era of Chinese history.\n\nA day-one release, Skate Story puts you in control of a demon who makes a deal with the devil to swallow the moon. As if that didn't sound challenging enough, your demonic avatar also happens to be constructed from glass and pain, so any fumble is going to hurt really badly. Not only do you have to master your skateboard, but you also have to use it to overcome other demons, save tormented souls with your sick tricks, and discover the secrets of hell without taking a tumble.\n\nAs the captain of a skyfaring crew, you've got free rein to explore the floating archipelago of the Sky Realm in Granblue Fantasy: Relink and find the legendary island of Estalucia. That's easier said than done, as between enemy gangs and a growing plot in the background that threatens the entire Sky Realm, you'll have your work cut out for you in this fantasy game.\n\nLooking to become a theme park master? Then you'll want to grab a download of Planet Coaster 2 and start building some attention-grabbing rides. Building on the foundation set by its predecessor, Planet Coaster 2 offers more tools and resources to not only construct exciting water rides and coasters, but also the facilities to keep your park guests happy when they've got their feet firmly planted on the ground.\n\nThe Cat Quest games are delightful adventures full of terrific puns, and Cat Quest 3 doesn't disappoint. An open-world action-RPG set in a fantastical pirate-themed world known as the Purribean, the threequel sees players search for a long-lost mythical treasure and battle Pi-rats on the high seas. The game is also playable in solo or co-op modes.\n\nWe've seen Aloy's debut adventure on PS4 and remastered for PS5, but the Lego version puts a lighthearted spin on a familiar tale. Set in a world where humanity is no longer at the top of the food chain following a robot uprising, Lego Horizon Adventures follows Aloy as she sets out to prove herself and discover the lost secrets of the planet. You can hunt machines as Aloy, or you can play as her allies Varl, Teersa, and Erend in this colorful Lego game.\n\nFor the younger members of the family, you can boot up not one but two Paw Patrol games for them. The first one is a kart-racer featuring the gang, as they compete to win the Pup Cup.\n\nThe second Paw Patrol game is an action-adventure where you can play as the pups. Just like the animated series, you can drive their signature vehicles, engage in rescue missions, and explore Adventure Bay to help out citizens in need.\n\nPlayStation Plus Premium subscription required\n\nThe timeless tale of swords and souls is back, as Soulcalibur 3 joins the classics library this month. Originally released in 2005 for PS2, Soulcalibur 3 on PS5 and PS4 has been upgraded with enhanced visuals, quick-save and rewind functionality, and custom video filters.",

    "fullText": "The Green Bay area received 4-5 inches of snow overnight Dec. 9 and the morning of Dec. 10, according to the National Weather Service Green Bay.\n\nThe storm, which NWS Green Bay meteorologist Kurt Kotenberg described as a classic low-end winter storm, was expected as the second part of a three-act weather system bringing snow and below-zero temperatures to northeastern Wisconsin.\n\nBrown County saw 4-5 inches of snow from the storm, with the NWS office in Green Bay receiving 5 inches as of 10 a.m. and Wrightstown getting 4.5 inches, Kotenberg said.\n\nThe weather led to several school closures and delays in the area.\n\nKotenberg said the area has seen the majority of the storm and he doesn't expect to see more snowfall Dec. 10. However, Kotenberg said, prepare for below-zero temperatures Dec. 13 and 14 as the weather service is likely to issue either a cold weather advisory, when temperatures are forecast to be 20 below zero, or an extreme cold warning, when temperatures are forecast 30 below zero.\n\n\"We are growing increasingly confident that wind chill values on Saturday morning and on Sunday morning will be between negative 20 and negative 25 degrees,\" Kotenberg said. \"I'm not fully convinced yet that the temperatures for the daytime will go above zero degrees on Saturday.\"\n\nAreas in Oconto County got anywhere between 1 inch and 5 inches of snow, Kotenberg said.\n\nNorthern Oconto County got less snow, with Mountain receiving 2 inches and Oconto Falls receiving 2.8. Areas in southern Oconto County, closer to Brown County, saw more, Kotenberg said, with Chase receiving 5 inches.\n\nDoor County received 1-3 inches of snow, Kotenberg said, with more snow falling in the southern portion of the county.\n\nEgg Harbor received 1.5 inches, Ephraim received 1.2 inches and Sturgeon Bay received 2.9 inches.\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service Green Bay:\n\nDec. 10: High 29, low 7. Wind gusts as high as 28 mph during the day, 21 mph at night.\n\nDec. 11: High 20, low 6. Slight chance of snow after midnight.\n\nDec. 12: High 21, low minus 2. 40% chance of snow, mainly after noon.\n\nDec. 14: High 9, low minus 2. 20% chance of snow after midnight.\n\nRefresh your browser if the radar isn’t working or click here if you can’t see it.\n\nVivian Barrett is the public safety reporter for the Green Bay Press-Gazette.

    "description": "Maybe it's not so bad to feel like someone is always watching you.",
    "fullText": "There’s a fine line between being micromanaged and overly surveilled and being monitored enough that you get good work done. That line is actually called the Hawthorne Effect, and it’s a phenomenon in which people are more productive when they feel they’re being observed. If you’ve ever noticed you push yourself a little more when you’re working out in a full gym or group fitness class than when you’re working out alone, you already get the concept, but it can be applied to all kinds of scenarios to make you more productive—even if you’re not actually being observed.\n\nThis phenomenon is said to have been discovered during some research conducted at the Hawthorne Western Electric Plant, though there’s some debate on whether that’s true. What isn’t up for debate is the behavior trend itself: When someone is participating in an experiment, they may tend to work a little harder than normal, knowing they’re being watched. Even outside of experiments, an awareness of being observed or monitored can spur a little productivity boost.\n\nResearchers and social scientists have spent decades trying to figure out if the Hawthorne Effect, as described in early research, is real or not, but it’s still a concept that has been noted and studied for a long time—and to which you may relate. Consider your childhood: You probably cleaned your room a little more diligently when your mom was standing in the doorway glaring at you than if she just told you to go do it. Not everyone performs better under the watchful eye of someone else, but if you’ve found that you do better work when you have regular check-ins with a boss, stay more focused when you know your time is being monitored, become the master of your maps app when you and your friends are lost, or spring into action when colleagues are looking for a leader, you could benefit from tapping into the Hawthorne Effect.\n\nYou can’t really make yourself be observed, right? You can’t ask your boss to monitor you all the time, for instance, but there are a few ways you can create the feeling of being watched or checked in on and harness it to be more productive. If you want to try to incorporate some of the Hawthorne Effect into your own life, try these ideas:\n\nRequest regular check-ins with your manager, even if they’re just weekly, 10-minute chats. Adding structured, scheduled conversations to your week will enhance the feeling that they’ll be expecting to hear about your recent work and results.\n\nFind an accountability partner. This could be a coworker, classmate, roommate, or anyone who is working on something similar to what you’re doing. Check in with them regularly, again on a set schedule, and always be prepared to update them on your progress.\n\nUse apps that can give you a feeling of being tracked, at least when it comes to your goals. Here’s a list of apps that can serve the purpose, whether you’re looking for a virtual accountability buddy or even one that acts as a demanding “boss,” sending you messages demanding proof of your progress. I use Finch, an app that forces me to check off to-do list items so I can buy little outfits for a pixelated bird avatar. Even the feeling that the app is monitoring me—which it is, by awarding me streaks and points when I complete tasks—motivates me. Whatever works!\n\nWork somewhere with other people around you, like a coffee shop or communal workspace, if you aren’t in the office. This actually works great for me, as I find it embarrassing to zone out or scroll social media if I’m working from a coffee shop. Logically, I realize no one there actually cares what I’m doing, but illogically, I still want to appear productive in front of strangers.\n\nTake group fitness classes. I teach spin classes and take my colleagues' various class formats multiple times per week in addition to working out on my own, and I know from experience that it is truly motivating to be surrounded by other people.",

    "fullText": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee on Tuesday said he will not intervene to stop the execution of Harold Wayne Nichols.\n\nNichols, 64, is scheduled to die by lethal injection on Thursday for the 1988 rape and murder of Karen Pulley, a 20-year-old student at Chattanooga State University.\n\nNichols confessed to killing Pulley as well as raping several other women in the Chattanooga area. Although he expressed remorse at trial, he admitted that he would have continued his violent behavior had he not been arrested. He was sentenced to death in 1990.\n\nNichols’ attorneys had sought to have his sentence commuted to life in prison, citing the fact that he took responsibility for his crimes and pleaded guilty. His clemency petition stated “he would be the first person to be executed for a crime he pleaded guilty to since Tennessee re-enacted the death penalty in 1978.”\n\nIn a statement emailed late on Tuesday, Lee said, “After deliberate consideration of Harold Wayne Nichols’ request for clemency, and after a thorough review of the case, I am upholding the sentence of the State of Tennessee and do not plan to intervene.”\n\nIn a recent interview, Pulley’s sister, Lisette Monroe, said the wait for Nichols’ execution has been “37 years of hell.” She described her sister as “gentle, sweet and innocent,” and said she hopes that after the execution she’ll be able to focus on the happy memories of Pulley instead of her murder.\n\nNichols' attorneys issued a statement saying they are “deeply saddened and gravely disappointed” by Lee's decision to deny clemency.\n\n“Wayne has spent decades taking accountability for his actions, working to transform his life, and being an extraordinary person who is loved and trusted by correctional officers, faith leaders, and many in his community,\" they wrote.\n\nNichols broke into Pulley’s home, raped her and beat her on the head with a 2-by-4 board. Pulley suffered massive brain injuries and died the next day.\n\nNichols was arrested several months after Pulley's murder for unrelated rapes and burglaries in the Chattanooga area. He confessed to raping several victims in Chattanooga over a two-month period prior to Pulley's slaying. He pleaded guilty to the rapes for two victims, but went to jury trial for two others and was convicted.",

    "fullText": "Dec 9 (Reuters) - Beijing is set to limit access to Nvidia's advanced H200 chips despite U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to allow the ​export of the technology to China, the Financial Times reported on ‌Tuesday, citing two people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nRegulators in Beijing have been discussing ways to ‌permit limited access to the H200, Nvidia's second-best generation of artificial intelligence chips, according to the report.\n\nSuch a move would add a hurdle to Nvidia and other top U.S. chipmakers' ability to address the China market, after Trump's Monday announcement appeared ⁠to settle a debate over ‌whether these companies should keep their global lead by selling AI chips to China or withhold shipments.\n\nNvidia shares, which had risen ‍as much as 2% in premarket trading, pared gains after the report and were last up about 0.6%. The company did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for ​comment on the report.\n\nBeijing has been pushing back against domestic firms' use of ‌U.S. technology, especially Nvidia chips, as it retaliates against American restrictions.\n\nEarlier U.S. restrictions banned the sale of advanced AI processors to China, weighing on Nvidia's ability to grow in one of the world's largest markets for AI chips and development.\n\nThe export of the H200 chips will be permitted with a 25% fee levied ⁠on such sales, Trump said in a ​post on Truth Social on Monday.\n\nIpek Ozkardeskaya, senior ​analyst at Swissquote Bank, said the approval alone may have limited impact on Nvidia's business in China unless it is allowed to ‍export other chip ⁠lines such as Blackwell or Rubin.\n\nShares of AMD and Intel also pared gains and were last up about 0.3% in premarket trading. So far ⁠this year, Nvidia has gained nearly 40% compared with the S&P 500 benchmark index's 16.4% rise ‌in the same period.",

    "fullText": "Microsoft's Patch Tuesday update for December is here, and Windows users should ensure their machines are updated as soon as possible to fix three zero-day vulnerabilities. These are security flaws that are actively exploited or publicly disclosed before the developer releases an official patch.\n\nAs reported by Bleeping Computer, this month's update addresses 56 bugs in total: 28 elevation-of-privilege vulnerabilities, 19 remote-code-execution vulnerabilities, four information-disclosure vulnerabilities, three denial-of-service vulnerabilities, and two spoofing vulnerabilities. Three of the remote code execution flaws are labeled \"critical.\" Note that these figures do not include updates released for Microsoft Edge and Mariner.\n\nPatch Tuesday is typically released on the second Tuesday of every month around 10am PT, so you can anticipate security updates at that time.\n\nOne of the zero-days patched in December has been actively exploited in the wild, though Microsoft has not shared any details as to how. CVE-2025-62221 is an elevation-of-privilege vulnerability in the Windows Cloud Files Mini Filter Driver, and when exploited, give attackers SYSTEM privileges. The mini filter allows cloud applications, such as OneDrive, access to file system functions.\n\nThe other two bugs fixed have been publicly disclosed:\n\nCVE-2025-64671 - GitHub Copilot for Jetbrains Remote Code Execution Vulnerability: This flaw, which can be exploited through a Cross Prompt Injection in untrusted files or MCP servers, allows attackers to execute commands locally. According to Krebs on Security, this could trick the LLM into adding malicious instructions in the user's auto-approve settings.\n\nCVE-2025-54100 - PowerShell Remote Code Execution Vulnerability: This bug could cause scripts embedded in a webpage to be executed when retrieved using Invoke-WebRequest.\n\nCVE-2025-62221 has been attributed to Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) & Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC). CVE-2025-64671 was disclosed by Ari Marzuk, while CVE-2025-54100 has been credited to multiple security researchers.",

    "fullText": "If you don't yet have a REAL ID, you can continue to fly, but it's going to cost you. Beginning Feb. 1, 2026, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will start collecting a $45 fee from travelers using non-compliant forms of identification at airport security checkpoints.\n\nThe agency previously proposed a fee of $18 to cover the administrative and IT costs of ID verification for those traveling without a REAL ID or passport but increased the total to $45 in an announcement released earlier this month.\n\nThe 2005 REAL ID Act mandated the standardization of state-issued driver's licenses and identification cards. After multiple delays since 2008, the Department of Homeland Security earlier this year finally began requiring anyone age 18 and over to have a REAL ID-compliant license to clear airport security or enter certain federal buildings.\n\nTravelers can also comply with the regulations using a U.S. passport, U.S. passport card, DHS Trusted Traveler card, or state-issued Enhanced Driver's License (from Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Vermont, of Washington). Enhanced Tribal Cards, permanent resident and border crossing cards, Department of Defense IDs, and foreign passports are also accepted.\n\nThe vast majority of Americans—94 percent—already have a REAL ID or another accepted form of identification. Those who don't will have to complete an online verification process and pay the $45 fee before they are able to clear airport security. Travelers are being encouraged to do this in advance: If you arrive without approval, you'll be sent out of line to complete the process (which can take up to 30 minutes) before being allowed through.\n\nThe $45 fee covers security checkpoint access for up to 10 days, after which you'll have to repeat the process and payment. Travelers whose REAL ID or passport has been lost or stolen also have to pay.",

    "title": "10 Hacks for Online Privacy That Everyone Should Know",
    "description": "There are a few easy steps everyone can take to protect their data on the internet.",
    "fullText": "The internet has become a vital tool for human connection, but it comes with its fair share of risks, with the biggest being your privacy and security. With the big tech giants hungry for every ounce of your data they can get and scammers looking to target you every day, you do need to take a few precautions to protect your online privacy and security. There's no foolproof approach to these two things, and unfortunately, the onus is on you to take care of your data.\n\nBefore you start looking for a VPN or ways to delete your online accounts, you should take a moment to understand your privacy and security needs. Once you do, it'll be a lot easier to take a few proactive steps to safeguard your privacy and security on the internet. Sadly, there's no \"set it and forget it\" solution for this, but I'm here to walk you through some useful hacks that can apply to whatever risks you might be facing.\n\nWhen you install an app on your phone, you'll often be bombarded with pop-ups asking for permission to access your contacts, location, notifications, microphone, camera, and many other things. Some are necessary, while most are not. The formula I use is to deny every permission unless it's absolutely necessary to the app's core function. Similarly, when you're creating a profile anywhere online, you should avoid giving out any personal information unless it's absolutely necessary.\n\nYou don't have to use your legal name, real date of birth, or an email address with your real name on most apps you Some sites also still use antiquated password recovery methods such as security questions that ask for your mother's maiden name. Even in these fields, you don't have to reveal the truth. Every bit of information that you put on the internet can potentially be exposed in a breach. It's best to use information that's either totally or partially fake to safeguard your privacy.\n\nIf your personal information is easily available on Google, and you want to get it removed, you can send Google a request to remove it. Check Google's support page for how to remove results to see specific instructions for your case. For most people, the simplest way to remove results about yourself is to go to Google's Results About You page, sign in, and follow the instructions on screen.\n\nMost modern email services let you create unlimited aliases, which means that you don't need to reveal your primary email address each time you Instead of signing up with [email protected], you can use something like [email protected]. Gmail lets you create unlimited aliases using this method, and you can use that to identify who leaked your data. If you suddenly start getting a barrage of spam to a particular alias, you'll know which site sold your data.\n\nWhen you take a photo, the file for it contains a lot of information about you. By default, all cameras will store EXIF (exchangeable image format) data, which logs when the photo was taken, which camera was used, and photo settings. You should remove exif data from photos before posting them on the internet. If you're using a smartphone to take photos, it'll also log the location of each image, which can be used to track you. While social media sites may sometimes remove location and exif data from your pictures, you cannot always rely on these platforms to protect your privacy for you.\n\nYou should take a few steps to strip exif data before uploading images. The easiest way to get started is to disable location access for your phone's camera app. On both iPhone and Android, you can open the Settings app, navigate to privacy settings or permissions, and deny location access to Camera. This will mean that you won't be able to search for a location in your photos app and identify all photos taken there, and you'll also lose out on some fun automated slideshows that Apple and Google create. However, it also means that your privacy is protected. You can also use apps to quickly hide faces and anonymize metadata from photos.\n\nWhile you're at it, don't forget that screenshots can also leak sensitive information about you. Some types of malware steal sensitive information from screenshots, so be sure to periodically delete those, too.\n\nNearly every single AI tool is mining your data to improve its services. Sometimes, this means it's using everything you type or upload. At other times, it could be using things you've written, photos or videos you've posted, or any other media you've ever uploaded to the internet, to train its AI models. There's not much you can do about mass data scraping off the internet, but you can and should be careful with your usage of AI tools. You can sometimes stop AI tools from perpetually using your data, but relying on these companies to honor those settings toggles is like relying on Meta to keep your data private. It's best to avoid revealing any personal information to any AI service, regardless of how strong a connection you feel with it. Just assume that anything you send to an AI service can, and probably will, be used to train AI models or even be sold to advertising companies.\n\nYes, big companies like Facebook or TikTok can track you even if you don't have an account with them. Data brokers collect vast troves of information about your internet visits, and sell it to advertisers or literally anyone who's willing to pay. To limit the damage, you can start by following Lifehacker's guide to blocking companies from tracking you online. Next, you can go ahead and opt out of data collection by data brokers. If that's not enough, you can also use services that remove your personal information from data broker sites.\n\nNow, I'm sure some of you are thinking that using a VPN will protect you from most of the tracking on the internet. That may be true in some cases, but using a VPN 24/7 is not the right approach for most people. For starters, it just routes all your traffic via the VPN company's servers, which means that you need to place your trust in the company's promises not to log your information, and its ability to keep your data safe and private. It also won't protect you from the types of data leaks that might happen from, say, publicly posting photos tagged with location data.\n\nMany VPN providers claim to be able to protect you, but there are downsides to consider. Some companies such as Mullvad and Proton VPN have earned a solid reputation for privacy, but using a VPN all the time can create more problems than it solves. Your internet speed slows down a lot, streaming services may not work properly, and lots of sites may not load at all because they block VPN IP addresses. In most cases, you'll probably be better off if you use adblockers and an encrypted DNS instead.\n\nFor most people, ad blockers are a good privacy tool. Even though Google is cracking down on ad blockers, there are ways to get around those restrictions. I highly recommend using uBlock Origin, which also has a mobile version now. Once you've settled on a good ad blocker, you should consider also using a good DNS service to filter out trackers, malware, and phishing sites on a network level.\n\nHaving a DNS service is like having a privacy filter for all your internet traffic, whether it's on your phone, laptop, or even your router. I've been using NextDNS for a few years, but you can also try AdGuard DNS or ControlD. All of these services have a generous free tier, but you can optionally pay a small annual fee for more features.\n\nAlmost all apps these days send telemetry data to remote servers. This isn't too much of a problem if you only use apps from trusted sources, and can help with things like automatic software updates. But malicious apps or even poorly managed ones may be more open with your data than you would like.\n\nYou can restrict some of that by using a good firewall app. This lets you monitor incoming and outgoing internet traffic from your device, and restrict devices from sending unwanted data to the internet. Blocking these requests can hamper some useful features, like those automatic app updates, but they can also stop apps from unnecessarily sending data to online servers. There are some great firewall apps for Mac and for Windows, and you should definitely consider using these for better online privacy.\n\nI've probably said this a million times, but I will repeat my advice: use a good password manager. You may think it's a bit annoying, but this single step is the easiest way to greatly improve your security on the internet. Password managers can take the hassle of remembering passwords away from you, and they'll also generate unique passwords that are hard to crack. Both Bitwarden and Apple Passwords (which ships with your Mac, iPhone, and iPad) are free to use, and excellent at their job. Go right ahead and start using them today. I guarantee that you won't regret it.",

    "title": "What People Are Getting Wrong This Week: The Real History of Santa Claus",
    "description": "Why St. Nick and Kris Kringle were once bitter enemies.",
    "fullText": "It’s Christmas time, so I’m taking a look at myths related to the holiday. Last week, I focused on myths about Jesus. This week I’m taking a look at that other beloved Christmas icon: Santa Claus, the central figure in the secular holiday mascot pantheon, who is so mysterious, we can’t even agree on his real name.\n\nI’m sure he’s innocent of any crimes, but Santa has many aliases. Among many other sobriquets and honorifics, the guy who brings presents in December goes by Jolly Old St. Nicholas, Kris Kringle, Père Noël, and Father Christmas. That’s a lot of fake identities, but what is his real name? And who invented him?\n\nThere is an often repeated myths that the modern image of Santa Claus—red clothes, white beard, fat—was created by the Coca Cola company in the 1930s to sell soda. But nah. While it’s true that Coke blanketed popular publications with ads featuring Haddon Sundblom’s illustrations of a red-clad hefty boy drinking Coke, Sundblom’s was drawing on existing depictions of Santa, particularly the 1822 poem \"A Visit From St. Nicholas,\" commonly called \"'Twas the Night Before Christmas.\"\n\n\"A Visit from St. Nicholas\" was written by Clement Clark Moore's and the poem did create some Santa details that have been nearly universally adopted. The chubbiness, the twinkly eyes, the jollyness, and the rosy cheeks are pure Moore. Also the sleigh and reindeer, the reindeer’s names, and Santa coming down the chimney were invented by Moore. But Moore didn’t invent Santa, because Moore thought St. Nick was a wee baby man.\n\nWhile Twas the Night Before Christmas offers no specific height for St. Nicholas, Moore describes St. Nick as “an elf,” and “a little old driver,” who pilots a “miniature sleigh” towed by “eight tiny reindeer.” He is said to fit up the chimney with ease, even though he has a belly like a bowlful of jelly. The preponderance of clues from Moore’s poem suggest St. Nick is around two feet tall.\n\nMoore’s poem isn’t even about Santa Claus. It’s about St. Nick, and much of Moore’s inspiration was based on centuries-old traditions, and those were based on folk myths drawn from Catholic hagiographies. But if you trace Santa Claus mythologies all the way back to the year 300, during the Roman Empire, you will actually land on a historically verified person who lived on earth. So Santa Claus is real—kind of.\n\nAbove is a depiction of St. Nicholas painted between 1503 and 1508. You may be wondering why St. Nick is pictured gesturing to three miniature, naked men standing in a wooden barrel—like what kind of Christmas parties did they have back then?? I’m going to get to it, believe me, but first—the facts.\n\nSaint Nicholas of Myra, also known as Nicholas the Wonderworker, was a Catholic bishop who lived in Turkey during the Roman Empire and (probably) attended the First Council of Nicaea in 325. He died on Dec. 6 sometime around 343. That’s all we know for sure about St. Nick—the earliest accounts of his life and deeds were hagiographies written centuries after his death, so, according to leading St. Nick historian Jona Lendering and common sense, can't be relied upon. But still, a cult formed around St. Nick, people built churches to him, and we still talk about him today as a good guy who brings kids presents, so he must have done something right. Here are only some of the good deeds and miracles attributed to St. Nicholas:\n\nAs an infant, refused to suckle his mother’s breast on Fridays\n\nRescued three girls from prostitution by giving their father gold to pay their dowries\n\nSaved three soldiers from wrongful execution\n\nChopped down a tree possessed by a demon\n\nSlapped the heretic Arius at the Council of Nicaea for suggesting God created Jesus\n\nAll those are good deeds, but one tale of St. Nick is a great deed that stands head and shoulders above the others; St. Nicholas, it is said, resurrected three children who had been murdered, chopped up, and and pickled in brine by an evil butcher planning to sell them as pork during a famine.\n\nAs you’d probably expect, the story of St. Nicholas confronting an evil butcher and bringing pickled children back from the grave caught on with people in a bigger way than the one about him slapping a heretic. Some variations had him enslaving the evil butcher and bringing him around on his yearly rounds to beat naughty children with a stick.\n\nAll of which brings us back to the homunculi:\n\nThe story of the resurrected children so enthralled people that artists started depicting St. Nick with three little buff boys in a vat (they only look like old men because painters in the early medieval period sucked at drawing children). “St. Nick with naked children” was seen so much that even people who hadn’t heard the story of the butcher associated the saint with children and he became known as the Saint who liked children (but not in a gross way). The legend and cult of St. Nicholas spread far and wide, and when it made it to the Netherlands, they called him “Sinterklaas\" which eventually became Santa Claus.\n\nKris Kringle and St. Nick were once bitter enemies, products of warring religious dogmas, but Christmas magic and American religious tolerance melded them into a single holiday entity.\n\nThe gift giver was called Christkindl, the Christ Child and was often depicted with wings. Said to hide mischievously when delivering gifts, Christkindl was to grown-up Jesus as The Muppet Babies are to The Muppets—not quite canonical, but fun for kids. He was also St. Nick's enemy, sent to erase the jolly old saint from the Protestant imagination, and the operation was partially successful. Christkindl is still the default seasonal gift bringer in some parts of the world. But the joke was ultimately on Martin Luther.\n\nChristkindl came to the U.S. with German immigrants in the 1800s. Germans met the Dutch settlers who were already here and devoted to St. Nicholas. Presumably because both St. Nicholas and Christkindle are myths told to children, there was no bitter, bloody religious war. Not a single heretic was slapped. Instead, they compromised: America gradually settled on presents being delivered on Dec. 25 instead of Dec. 6, but Santa Claus brought the gifts instead of Christkindl, whose name eventually morphed into “Kris Kringle,” another name for Santa/St. Nick.",

    "fullText": "Netflix's January lineup is on the lighter side, but includes the return of period romance series Bridgerton (Jan. 29). Season four centers on Benedict, the second-eldest sibling, and Sophie, who he meets at Lady Bridgerton’s masquerade ball. The first four episodes drop in January, with the remaining four coming at the end of February.\n\nAnother original series worth watching is Agatha Christie's Seven Dials (Jan. 15), an adaptation of crime author's novel The Seven Dials Mystery.

    "title": "This Volume App for Mac Lets You Do More With Your Earbuds and Speakers",
    "description": "This is the best app to set 'per-app' volume on your Mac.",
    "fullText": "SoundSource, my preferred volume control app on the Mac, just got a major upgrade. The developer, Rogue Amoeba, recently released SoundSource 6 for Mac, which adds support for AirPlay devices, per-app equalizers, output device groups, and much more. It's an incredibly polished app packed with features, but my favorite feature is its ability to turn any random group of earbuds and speakers into a multi-room audio setup.\n\nYou can use SoundSource 6 to create a group of audio output devices, including Bluetooth speakers, wired headphones, AirPods, AirPlay speakers, and literally any other audio device your Mac can connect to. Then, you can send audio from any app to all of these devices at the same time, making for the ideal multi-room audio setup. I've used this to play Apple Music songs simultaneously on my AirPods, Bluetooth speakers, my Mac's speaker, and my HomePod. It's a great way to get music playing throughout your whole house.\n\nTo get started, click SoundSource's menu bar icon to open the app, and click the drop-down menu next to any app's volume slider. You'll see a button called Create Output Group or Edit Output Groups. Click this button and select New Group. You can now add as many audio devices as you want to the group.\n\nIn theory, you could also use this to chain a bunch of Bluetooth speakers from different brands to enjoy a more immersive audio experience while watching a movie, but in practice, latency makes the experience less than ideal. Even a slight lag in one of the speakers can ruin an immersive audio experience, but that's not SoundSource's fault. It's a difficult job to get multiple speakers from different brands, which use different audio output standards, to work as a perfect surround sound setup. Given the barriers in place, SoundSource does an admirable job with its task.\n\nI found that the multi-room audio feature works best when you're listening to music with one speaker in each room. That way, the slight latency won't bother you at all, and you can have music to keep you company as you run through household chores.\n\nAs someone who's used SoundSource since 2017, I've always missed the ability to send audio to AirPlay devices. Until recently, Rogue Amoeba had left that feature to another of its apps—Airfoil. However, SoundSource's latest release adds support for AirPlay devices, which means that you can finally use it to send audio from any app on your Mac to a HomePod, Apple TV, or other AirPlay-enabled device.\n\nI use SoundSource to redirect audio from certain apps to specific speakers, and with AirPlay support, I can send music straight to my HomePod, while restricting notification sounds from messaging apps to the Mac's built-in speakers.\n\nI first started using SoundSource for its ability to let you set a custom volume level for each app on your Mac. I used this to reduce the volume of notifications from Messages and Slack, while keeping sounds from other apps at a higher level. SoundSource 6 has added another layer to this feature by shipping a per-app equalizer, which lets you set a different sound profile for every single app you use. It ships with nearly two dozen EQ presets for you to choose from. You can choose one EQ preset for music streaming apps and a different one for the apps you use to watch movies. You can locate this feature by clicking the right-arrow button under the FX section in SoundSource.\n\nSoundSource also lets you set a custom volume level for each audio device your Mac is connected to. This lets me reduce the volume on a particularly loud Bluetooth speaker I own, while keeping my Mac's speaker volume a little higher. The app also allows you to set a maximum volume limit for each audio device, which you should use for two reasons: To prevent hearing loss if you're using headphones, and to avoid damaging your speakers. I've accidentally damaged a speaker by keeping it at 100% volume for a few hours in an outdoor venue, which isn't what the speaker was designed for. Since then, I've shied away from running speakers at full volume, and you can use the maximum volume limit feature here to help with that.\n\nTo use this feature, open SoundSource and click the speaker icon in the top-right corner. This will show you all your input and output devices. Select any device and locate the Output tab in the right pane. Here, move the Max Volume slider to an acceptable limit.\n\nSoundSource 6 has many other new features that make it worth the upgrade. You can set a preferred device order to ensure that your Mac doesn't accidentally connect to the wrong audio devices. I use this to set my AirPods as my preferred speaker, followed by my HomePod, my Mac's own speakers, and my Bluetooth speaker comes in last. The app also allows you to add volume controls for individual apps to the menu bar, which means that you can control the audio level of Chrome, Music, Spotify, or any other app without opening the main SoundSource window. This is great for the times when you only want to adjust a single app's volume.\n\nThere's also a neat feature where SoundSource can set your AirPods to 'output-only' mode, which means that every app will use the Mac's built-in mic for input and send the audio to the AirPods. Rogue Amoeba says this improves audio quality on the AirPods significantly.\n\nThere are many such quality-of-life improvements in this app, which made it an easy decision for me to buy its sixth version. If you've never used SoundSource before, you'll have to pay $49 to use the app. There is a trial mode that lets you try the app for up to 20 minutes for free, after which it degrades the audio. Those upgrading from previous versions of SoundSource can get the updated app for $25.",

    "fullText": "A woman on Reddit sparked a wave of outrage and sympathy after revealing that her mom regularly claims they’re broke, while secretly sending thousands of dollars to a megachurch.\n\n“My mom says we don’t have enough money, but I catch her giving thousands of dollars monthly to a megachurch,” the person wrote on r/mildlyinfuriating earlier this year. The post, which included a photo of a $600 online donation receipt to Bill Winston Ministries, drew over 142,000 upvotes and more than 7,600 comments.\n\nThe ‘ChatGPT of Marketing' Just Opened a $0.85/Share Round — 10,000+ Investors Are Already In\n\nAmericans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\nThe receipt showed contributions like $300 in tithes, $100 for missions, and a $30 donation to an “Airplane Fund.” That last item became a flashpoint for ridicule and anger across the comment section. “Gotta have that airplane fund so Pastor Fancy Pants can soar with the eagles and not have to be sitting next to some poor sinner on a United flight,” one person wrote.\n\nOthers pointed out how blatant the grift appeared. “Airplane fund on the receipt is very bold,” another commenter said. Some joked that the church leaders couldn’t possibly fly in a “metal tube full of demons”– a reference to televangelist Kenneth Copeland‘s infamous explanation for why he needed a private jet.\n\nThe screenshot added fuel to growing frustration over prosperity gospel churches, which promise financial blessings to donors. As one person wrote, “This isn't mildly infuriating. It's enraging!”\n\nTrending: Have $100k+ to invest? Charlie Munger says that's the toughest milestone — don't stall now. Get matched with a fiduciary advisor and keep building\n\nCommenters flooded the thread with personal stories of loved ones who were also caught in similar cycles. One person said their grandmother lived in a roach-infested apartment but sent most of her fixed income to her church. Another wrote, “We didn’t have enough money for me to go to the doctor or the dentist, but we sure had enough to give her church $100 a week.”\n\nThe thread painted a bleak picture of religious manipulation, with many describing megachurches as cults. Some called for regulatory action, questioning how these tax-exempt organizations can rake in millions. “How is this even legal? I think an IRS audit is overdue. Televangelists are vultures,” one person said.\n\nOne of the most upvoted comments put it bluntly: “These people are nothing more than con artists with tax exemption.”",

    "fullText": "Dec 10 - Chinese rare-earth magnet suppliers to U.S. automaker Ford Motor were included in the first batch of new ​export licences issued by Beijing to boost shipments and reduce shortages of ‌the vital components, the carmaker said on Wednesday.\n\nThe so-called general licences were agreed after Presidents Xi Jinping ‌and Donald Trump met in South Korea and will reportedly allow larger shipments with fewer hurdles under year-long permits for individual customers.\n\nChina’s introduction of rare-earth export controls in April forced companies to apply for licences for every shipment, creating shortages that brought parts of ⁠the auto supply chain to ‌a halt and handed Beijing enormous leverage in trade talks with Washington.\n\nChina has said little publicly about the new licences, how they ​will work or who will receive them, raising fears among non-U.S. diplomats and ‌producers that the licences will be for U.S. customers primarily.\n\nThose concerns were heightened this week when Germany's Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said that the country's automakers were not included in this first round. Many of those manufacturers, such as Volkswagen, have had ties with China for many years.\n\nWadephul said that \"quite a lot of work\" was still ⁠needed to persuade Beijing to grant the new ​licences to German companies.\n\nWhile the system agreed between ​Xi and Trump should accelerate exports for some customers, it remains to be seen how widely Beijing will issue licences and whether customers ‍in more sensitive sectors ⁠such as aerospace or semiconductors will qualify. China's rare-earth exports jumped in November.\n\n\"While we are pleased that some of our suppliers have secured these approvals, we ⁠urge the U.S. and Chinese governments to continue their collaboration to fully resolve supply chain issues,\" ‌Ford said in its statement to Reuters.",

    "fullText": "On Saturday, Dec. 6, a convenience store manager in Louisiana locked out a group of Border Patrol agents, denying them entry to the store.\n\nWayne Davis, who is assistant manager of the store in Kenner, was helping a customer when he noticed two unmarked SUVs pull into the parking lot and stop at the front of the store.\n\nAfter seeing agents wearing border patrol vests exit the two vehicles, Davis locked the door from behind the counter as the agents approached, WWL Louisiana reported.\n\nThe agents kept trying to open the door, looking at Davis through the store window in confusion. This is when Davis began recording, WWL Louisiana reported.\n\nIn the video, Davis is seen raising his middle finger to the agents outside before moving from his place behind the counter and standing at the entrance of the store.\n\nFrom behind the store's closed door, Davis begins goading the agents lingering outside near the store's front.\n\n\"What do you want man, you want some chicken? You ain't getting it here... Go somewhere else, you ain't getting no chicken,\" Davis taunts.\n\nAfter noticing Davis recording on his cellphone from within the store, one of the only agents seen without facial coverings turns his back to the door.\n\n\"Dang, you don't wanna show your face now?... I know you can hear me... Why you not showing your face? You wanted to show your face everywhere else,\" Davis provokes while still recording.\n\nDavis told WWL Louisiana that, at this point, he realized the agent was Gregory Bovino, who is commander of Border Patrol and has been in New Orleans as part of Operation Catahoula Crunch.\n\n\"Bye, bye,\" Davis said facetiously while waving from behind the store's locked door as agents retreated back into their vehicles.\n\nDavis is seen in the video raising his middle finger once more as the unmarked SUVS drive away and exit the parking lot\n\nLouisiana state law dictates interfering with immigration operations a felony offense, considering interfering actions an obstruction of justice.\n\nHowever, businesses generally retain the right to refuse service to any person for any reason, unless that person belongs to a protected class, which immigration enforcement agents are not a part of.\n\nFurthermore, if a business denies immigration enforcement agents entry, they cannot forcibly enter unless there is a judicial warrant signed by a judge, according to the ACLU.\n\nPresley Bo Tyler is a reporter for the Louisiana Deep South Connect Team for USA Today.

    "fullText": "Philip Rivers has come out of retirement to rejoin the Indianapolis Colts, five years after the 44-year-old grandfather last played in the NFL.\n\nThe Colts faced a sudden need to fill their quarterback room after picking up two injuries during Sunday's 36-19 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\nDaniel Jones was ruled out with a season-ending Achilles injury and his replacement, third-string rookie Riley Leonard, picked up a knee problem.\n\nBack-up quarterback Anthony Richardson was already out with a facial injury, so Rivers worked out for the Colts on Monday - his 44th birthday.\n\nThe father of 10, who has been serving as the head coach at St. Michael Catholic High School in Alabama, has now been added to the team's practice squad.\n\nThat makes Rivers the oldest current player in the NFL, surpassing Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who turned 42 last week.\n\nAfter spending the first 16 years of his NFL career with the Chargers franchise, Rivers joined the Colts in 2020 and led them to an 11-5 record, falling at the first hurdle in the play-offs.\n\nThe Colts, who were this season's pacesetters before losing their past three games to slip to 8-5, have promoted Brett Rypien from their practice squad to their active roster, making the 29-year-old eligible for Sunday's game at the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nRivers is seventh on the NFL's all-time list for passing yards (63,440) and sixth for touchdown passes (421).\n\nColts head coach Shane Steichen served as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach while Rivers was with the Chargers.\n\nRivers' eldest child is two months older than Colts rookie Leonard and leading up to this year's draft - when he was a sixth-round pick by Indianapolis - the 23-year-old worked with Rivers as the veteran lives in his hometown of Fairhope, Alabama.\n\nRivers' return could also affect his Hall of Fame status. Players become eligible five years after ending their career and, in his first year of eligibility, Rivers has been named a semi-finalist for the class of 2026.\n\nIf he remains on the Colts' practice squad, he will maintain his eligibility, but if he is elevated to the active roster, he will not be eligible again until the class of 2031.",

    "fullText": "Elche are one of the surprise stories of this La Liga season, with Los Ilicitanos pulling up trees after earning promotion last year. Eder Sarabia’s side are not just comfortably clear of the drop, but are playing attractive football and have caused problems for La Liga’s big three this season.\n\nCurrently Elche sit in 9th place, with a seven-point advantage over Girona in 18th. A number of players have stood out, including starlet Rodrigo Mendoza, Martim Neto, German Valera or at the back, David Affengruber.\n\nThe latter was part of their promotion push last season, and has turned into the leader of Sarabia’s backline, combining crunching challenges with smart interventions and neat use of the ball. It is no suprise that Europe’s hungry pack of scouts have descended on the Martinez Valero to view some of their talents, including Affengruber.\n\nCaught Offside have revealed that Manchester United have been to Alicante on multiple occasions to watch Affengruber, and the reports on the Austrian defender have been ‘highly positive’. Elche are believed to be asking for around €30m for the 24-year-old, should a bigger fish swoop for the Austrian.\n\nAffengruber has been a stalwart in defence for Elche, who despite their open style of play, rank in the top half defensively with 17 goals conceded in 15 games. On a personal level, FBRef rank him third for interceptions in La Liga, 8th for dribblers tackled and 10th for clearances across the division.\n\nSigned from Sturm Graz on a free transfer two summers previously, Affengruber has arguably been one of the best in his position in La Liga, and on more than one occasion has earned the public praise of Sarabia. While Manchester United would be dramatic leap, it would be no surprise to see bids come in for him in the coming months.",

    "description": "With Victor Wembanyama still sidelined, our Spurs vs. Lakers predictions expect LeBron James to thrive in the paint.",
    "fullText": "LeBron James has fresh legs and no Victor Wembanyama to worry about when his Los Angeles Lakers host the San Antonio Spurs in the NBA Cup quarterfinals tonight.\n\nHere are my best Spurs vs. Lakers predictions and NBA picks for December 10.\n\nSpurs vs Lakers best bet: LeBron James Over 18.5 points (-115)\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers have a full battery after last playing on December 7. That break will have the aging legs of LeBron James going all out in this NBA Cup contest.\n\nA game removed from his insane 10-point streak getting snapped, James put in his best performance of the season so far (he’s only played in seven games since returning in mid-November).\n\nHe shot 12-for-17 from the floor, including 4-for-6 from 3-point range, and scored 29 points in the win over the 76eron s Sunday. LeBron was mired in a shooting funk the three games prior, going a collective 12-for-40 in those showings (30%).\n\n“Just at 40 years old, I mean, it just takes a while for my body to kind of get back into a rhythm,” James told the media about snapping his shooting skid. “And so, it felt good tonight to kind of feel like myself a little bit, being able to run and jump and cut and catch my second wind a lot faster tonight. Hopefully that stays.”\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs were hoping to have Victor Wembanyama back for this tournament tilt as he traveled with the team to L.A. However, the Spurs were quick to announce that he would not play, updating his status last night.\n\nSan Antonio desperately misses the 7-footer on both ends of the floor, but the defense has seen a notable slip without Wemby’s length causing chaos. The Spurs were the No. 6 team in advanced defensive rating before his injury in mid-November and have slid to 21st in that metric in the 11 games without him.\n\nThe interior protection has fallen off a cliff without Wembanyama’s 8-foot-4 wingspan blocking and changing shots. San Antonio allows the second fewest points in the paint per game (40) with him in action, but sees opponents’ PITP surge to 55.6 (29th) since his calf injury.\n\nJames is averaging 7.7 PITP in his first seven games since missing the start of the schedule with back issues — making up 48% of this scoring output. Against the Sixers on Sunday, LeBron upped that inside presence to 10 points in the painted area.\n\nProjections for today’s NBA Cup game have James pegged for around 17 points, but with models updating for Wembanyama’s absence, those forecasts sit closer to 20 points against the Spurs tonight.\n\nJames looks like he worked off the rust and can attack this Spurs interior without Wemby on the court.\n\nSan Antonio’s defensive chops have crumbled without their star in the middle. The Spurs have gone Over the total in five of their last six games.\n\nThe Lakers just have too much firepower for the Spurs to handle, especially on their home court.\n\nHarrison Barnes has upped his scoring in Wembanyama’s absence and scored 24 last time out against the Pelicans.\n\nHarrison Barnes Over 12.5 points\n\nSpread: Spurs +6.5 | Lakers -6.5\n\nMoneyline: Spurs +200 | Lakers -240\n\nOver/Under: Over 237.5 | Under 237.5\n\nThe Spurs are 8-4 Over/Under as a visitor this season and have topped the total in 57% of their road games going back to last season.

    "description": "Three veteran starters have been ruled out for LSU's appearance in the Texas Bowl in late December.",
    "fullText": "LSU football will take the field for the Texas Bowl without three key starters. According to NOLA.com’s Wilson Alexander, cornerback Mansoor Delane, quarterback Garrett Nussmeier and linebacker Whit Weeks will all miss the Tigers’ contest against Houston due to injuries.\n\nNussmeier missing this outing shouldn’t come as a big surprise. He missed the last three games of LSU’s season due to a core injury that had been bothering him since fall camp. Since he’s likely preparing for the NFL Draft and the Tigers want to see more of sophomore quarterback Michael Van Buren, it wasn’t expected that he would play.\n\nWeeks’ absence also isn’t much of a shock. He broke his ankle during LSU’s game against Ole Miss, and despite retaking the field for the Tigers’ final two games of the season, he probably needs to focus on rehabbing for either his senior season with the Tigers or the NFL draft.\n\nThe same goes for Delane, who played through a core injury for most of the season and is expected to be a first-round pick in the upcoming 2026 NFL draft.\n\nLSU has already gotten a good look at the depth behind Weeks and Nussmeier due to their missed time, but Delane being out will give Tigers fans an early look at the young cornerback duo of D.J. Pickett and P.J. Woodland, the latter of whom spent more time in the slot during the games when Delane was healthy.\n\nLSU will face the Houston Cougars on December 27th at 8:15 CT.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LSU Wire: LSU football rules out three starters for bowl game vs Houston",

    "fullText": "Well, if anybody thought the Philadelphia Eagles’ season was going poorly heading into the game against the Los Angeles Chargers, things now look 10 times worse than anyone could have imagined.\n\nJalen Hurts arguably played his worst game as a professional, throwing four interceptions and fumbling.\n\nSaquon Barkley tried to get some things going on the ground, rushing 20 times for 122 yards and a touchdown, but it felt like Nick Sirianni and Kevin Patullo didn’t do enough to get him the football later in the game.\n\nInstead, they allowed Hurts to continue running the offense, and unfortunately, he was brutal.\n\nThere were questions about whether Sirianni was taking over more as a play-caller over the past few days, and he admitted that he had his hands on the offense much more than usual.\n\nWhen speaking after the game, he thought the offense did some good things, but added that he has to continue trying to help it improve.\n\n“Yeah, you know, again, I’m the head coach,” Sirianni said, per NBC Philly. “My attention goes to places that I feel like it needs to go. This week was with the offense, and I will continue to go in there with those guys and grind it out through the weeds with them and continue to move forward with that.”\n\n“Again, I thought we moved the ball and did a lot of good things today,” Sirianni said. “But you know, again, we didn’t finish drives and we didn’t for multiple reasons and had some turnovers for multiple reasons. You always look to improve the process, and we’ll get back to work and grind out through it again and I anticipate being in there still.”\n\nAs the Eagles get prepared for the back end of the season, it’s tough to say this team is in a good spot.\n\nNow sitting at 8-5, Philadelphia not only put itself in a tough position to win the division, but if it continues to lose games, there’s even a chance it can miss the playoffs.\n\nNobody would’ve expected that after winning a Super Bowl a year ago, so it’s something the Eagles will have to figure out.",

Mbappe remains far from full fitness, but with such a decisive match on the horizon, he has declared himself ready to make an effort.\n\nHis presence in the squad poses a new dilemma for Xabi Alonso: does he start him from the opening whistle, or keep him on the bench to introduce later depending on the flow of the match?\n\n📋✅ ¡Nuestros convocados!\n🆚 @ManCityES pic.twitter.com/mpMLYALCc0\n\n— Real Madrid C.F.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWinter Meetings latest news and rumors\n\nFree agent signings and trades by team\n\nThe MLB offseason can move at a painfully slow pace, but if history is any indication, December will be the busiest month, thanks in part to the Winter Meetings.\n\nThe annual congregation of executives, managers and free agents and, of course, agents takes place in Orlando this year, and there is plenty of business to get done.\n\nA fairly impressive crop of free agents is mostly unsigned, though there are some exceptions. Dylan Cease already landed with the Toronto Blue Jays on a seven-year, $210 million deal, while Josh Naylor and Devin Williams are among other names who have earned new deals in the weeks leading up to the Winter Meetings.\n\nThe trade market could be worth watching more closely than the free-agent market as the Winter Meetings play out. While a Tarik Skubal trade doesn't seem imminent or even particularly likely this offseason, Ketel Marte, MacKenzie Gore and Jarren Duran are among the names who have surfaced in rumors.\n\nThe Sporting News is tracking all of the latest buzz below, from rumors to signings and trades. Follow along with the latest updates below.\n\nMORE:Ranking the top MLB free agents\n\nThe Red Sox are seen as strong candidates for Ketel Marte compared to the Blue Jays because of their young starting pitching depth, Jon Morosi reports. The Diamondbacks have been known to be targeting young starters in any Marte talks.\n\nThe Tigers have agreed to a two-year, $19 million deal to bring back reliever Kyle Finnegan. Acquired from the Nationals at the July deadline, Finnegan impressed with a 1.50 ERA and 11.5 K/9 rate in 16 appearances with the Tigers, putting himself in line for save opportunities in 2026.\n\nThe Orioles and Nationals have had \"steady communication\" about SP MacKenzie Gore, whose name has been floated in trade rumors since the July deadline, Jon Morosi reports.\n\nTampa Bay's Brandon Lowe is among the names surfacing in trade talks for second basemen, and the chances of a deal this week are \"increasing,\" Jon Morosi reports.\n\nThe market for Diamondbacks 2B Ketel Marte is \"heating up,\" Jon Heyman reports, with the Red Sox, Mariners, Blue Jays, Phillies and Rays all believed to be in the mix for the All-Star.\n\nThe Red Sox have discussed a Corey Seager trade with the Rangers, the Boston Globe reports, though WEEI's Rob Bradford says the talks don't have momentum at the moment. Seager has been a superstar with the Rangers when healthy, but Texas is on a mission to shed salary this winter and the two-time World Series MVP still has six years remaining on his massive contract.\n\nThe Marlins are \"engaged\" in trade talks involving SP Edward Cabrera with numerous teams, Jon Heyman reports. Cabrera enjoyed a breakout season for Miami in 2025 and was a popular name leading up to the July deadline.\n\nThe Pirates have agreed to a one-year, $7.75 million deal with reliever Gregory Soto, who posted a 4.18 ERA and 3.42 FIP between the Orioles and Mets in 2025.\n\nThe Cubs met with the star infielder over Zoom \"a few weeks ago,\" per Robert Murray.\n\nWith Kyle Schwarber off the market, and Baltimore being one potential landing spot for him, Morosi reports that the Orioles have spoken with the camp of Kyle Tucker.\n\nBefore Kyle Schwarber agreed to re-sign with the Phillies, Baltimore matched Philadelphia's offer of five years, $150 million, per Rosenthal. The Reds offered Schwarber a five-year deal \"in the $125 million range,\" while the Pirates offered four years and $120 million.\n\nPer Jon Morosi, within the AL East, the Red Sox are viewed as a stronger trade candidate for star infielder Ketel Marte than the Blue Jays, because of Boston's depth of MLB-ready starters.\n\nSpeaking at the Winter Meetings, agent Scott Boras said he expects 1B Pete Alonso's market to pick up now that Kyle Schwarber has signed. Alonso has reportedly been in and out of the meetings to meet with teams, including the Red Sox and Orioles.\n\nThe Tigers have been floated as a potential Alex Bregman suitor, but they also have real interest in SS Ha-Seong Kim, according to the Detroit Free Press. Kim, a terrific defender, landed with the Rays last offseason but missed most of 2025 and finished the year with the Braves. After a healthy September, Kim opted out of his deal.\n\nThe Mets \"may be hesitant to go more than three years\" on a new deal for 1B Pete Alonso, MLB.com's Mark Feinsand reports, which could complicate the path to a reunion between the two sides. Alonso settled for a short deal last winter but is looking for long-term security this time around after a strong season at the plate.\n\nThe Angels are acquiring infielder Vaughn Grissom from the Red Sox, in exchange for OF prospect Isaiah Jackson. Grissom, Boston's one-for-one return for Chris Sale two years ago, struggled in a brief MLB stint in 2024 and spent all of 2025 in the minor leagues, posting a .783 OPS. 2026 will be Grissom's age-25 season.\n\nThe Padres and GM A.J. Preller are \"shooting big\" in trade talks and working on \"multiple fronts\" to put together significant deals, the San Diego Union-Tribune reports.\n\nWith the Mets' former closer, Edwin Diaz, off the market, New York is now viewed as a suitor for the new top available reliever, Robert Suarez. The Blue Jays are also in the mix, per Jon Morosi.\n\nFormer Mets closer Edwin Diaz has agreed to a deal with the Dodgers, according to The Athletic's Will Sammon, bolstering a bullpen that was a rare weakness for much of the regular season in 2025.\n\nDiaz's deal is worth $69 million over three years, per Jeff Passan.\n\nThe Phillies have agreed to a five-year, $150 million deal to re-sign DH Kyle Schwarber, according to ESPN's Jeff Passan. Schwarber, who was the runner-up for NL MVP in 2025, was also pursued by the Reds, Pirates, Orioles and Mets.\n\nWhile the Red Sox are taking a look at a bevy of infielders, including Pete Alonso, Bo Bichette and Ketel Marte, a reunion with Alex Bregman remains Boston's \"No. 1 target,\" according to The Athletic. A trade for Isaac Paredes could be a fallback option if a deal can't be reached with Bregman.\n\nHarris answered a question about Tarik Skubal's trade status, as the executive said he wouldn't be doing his job if he didn't listen. Skubal has one year left on his contract, which could prompt Detroit to trade him before the season begins if the team gets a good deal.\n\nMatz is a former starter who transitioned to the bullpen last season, and found success with the Red Sox late in the year, finishing the season with a 3.05 ERA between St. Louis and Boston. Topkin adds that the deal will span two years.\n\nMegill was the best relievers on the Brewers last year, but Milwaukee is always exploring different ways to mix up its team. The Yankees have a reliever vacancy after losing Devin Williams to the Mets in free agency, but the Mets also still need to upgrade their bullpen.\n\nAccording to Rome, no deal is close, but Houston's interest in Baz is real and could be the type of move that the team prefers. Baz is coming off a season where he made a career-high 31 starts for the Rays, but still pitched to a 4.87 ERA.\n\nGore is one of several pitchers who could be traded, as the Nats look to build for the future. While Golden also reports the Red Sox and Padres explored a Gore trade at the trade deadline, he specifically names the Yankees as a team that has made a call in recent days.\n\nSuarez is one of the top relievers on the market, and the Mets, Blue Jays and Dodgers are all teams that have shown interest in improving their bullpens. Those three teams have also been linked to top closer Edwin Diaz, which makes Suarez a potential fallback option.\n\nCotillo added that other teams may be waiting for Schwarber to sign before moving on to other players. While the Phillies are believed to be the favorite to retain the DH, but the Red Sox, Mets, Reds and Pirates have all been linked to Schwarber as well.\n\nThe Diamondbacks are willing to listen on 2B Ketel Marte and are emphasizing MLB-ready starting pitchers in talks, but their asking price remains high, according to Jon Morosi. Marte has been one of the hottest names as the Winter Meetings get underway, indicating teams believe he can be had in a trade, and interested teams  reportedly include the Red Sox, Blue Jays and Mariners.\n\nThe Orioles are in on free agent starter Ranger Suarez, Jon Heyman reports. Suarez is one of the top free agent arms available, and Baltimore has been connected to starters since the offseason began.\n\nFree agent 1B Pete Alonso is heading to the Winter Meetings to meet with interested suitors, including the Red Sox and Orioles, according to the New York Post. Alonso lives a short drive away from Orlando, so he will meet in-person with interested teams.\n\nYankees GM Brian Cashman said at the Winter Meetings that the organization is \"open-minded\" but doesn't have to do as much as last winter because of the talent on the roster. \"We have really good players on this roster, and we are covered in most all areas that you need to be covered.\"\n\nThe Nationals are receiving heavy interest in SS CJ Abrams in trade talks and are open to dealing him, The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal and Will Sammon report. Washington is also talking about deals centered on SP MacKenzie Gore as the new front office looks to shake up the organization.\n\nThe Blue Jays are also among teams talking to the Diamondbacks about 2B Ketel Marte, Jon Heyman reports. The Red Sox and Mariners were reported Sunday as potential suitors for Marte, though there doesn't appear to be much traction in talks yet, Heyman reports.\n\nThe Diamondbacks have agreed to a one-year, $7.5 million deal with pitcher Michael Soroka. Soroka split the 2025 season with the Nationals and Cubs, posting a 4.87 ERA and 4.16 FIP over 16 starts with Washington before an injury limited him to 8.1 strong innings with Chicago. Soroka could function as either a starter or reliever in Arizona.\n\nDiamondbacks second baseman Ketel Marte is in high demand this offseason, as a number of suitors have pursued the All-Star infielder. The Red Sox, Mariners, Pirates, Rays, Tigers and Jays are all listed as targets by New York Post's Jon Heyman.\n\nOne of the top arms available on the market, Valdez has been travelling from coast to coast, as it's reported he's visited Baltimore, New York and San Francisco. The 32-year-old lefty finished his eighth season in Houston last year with a .366 ERA.\n\nThe Pirates said they were looking to spend this offseason around Paul Skenes. How about Phillies slugger Kyle Schwarber? Pittsburgh has reportedly put a four-year offer in for the free agent, while Red Sox, Cubs, Reds and others remain in the mix.\n\nThe Mariners have acquire reliever Jose Ferrer from the Nationals, in exchange for catching prospect Harry Ford and pitching prospect Isaac Lyon. The 25-year-old Ferrer has unspectacular raw numbers as a major-leaguer, but a career 3.33 FIP, impressive walk rate and high velocity make him a potential high-leverage reliever for Seattle, while Ford is a consensus top-75 prospect in baseball and could be the Nationals' catcher of the future.\n\nDespite July's firesale, the Minnesota Twins are not planning to trade Joe Ryan, Byron Buxton or Pablo Lopez this winter, The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal reports. The Twins discussed a Ryan trade with the Boston Red Sox at the deadline but decided against dealing their young ace.\n\nThe Detroit Tigers remain \"engaged\" with teams on a potential Tarik Skubal trade, according to ESPN's Buster Olney, but they are still unsure about dealing him and have an \"enormous\" asking price. Skubal, the back-to-back reigning AL Cy Young Award winner, is set to be a free agent after the 2026 season and is reportedly far apart in extension talks with the Tigers.\n\nP Ryan Yarbrough (re-signed, 1yr/$2.5M)\n\nP Drew Anderson (1yr/$7M with $10M option for 2027)\n\nRP Kyle Finnegan (re-signed, 2yr/$19M)\n\n1B Josh Naylor (re-signed, 5yr/$92.5M)\n\nDH Kyle Schwarber (re-signed, 5yr/$150M)\n\nCL Emilio Pagan (re-signed, 2yr/$20M)\n\nC James McCann (re-signed, 1yr/$2.75M)\n\nINF Miguel Rojas (re-signed, 1yr/$5.5M)\n\nHere are the remaining free agents from SN's ranking of the top 27 free agents this winter:\n\nJapanese standouts Tatsuya Imai and Kazuma Okamoto were also posted and are available to MLB teams, making for one of the strongest-ever free agent crops of Japanese talent in one offseason.",

    "fullText": "The NFL is heading back to Munich. After playing games in the German city in both 2022 and 2024, the NFL announced Wednesday it will return to Munich in both 2026 and 2028 for regular-season games.\n\nThe move is part of a multiyear partnership with both the city of Munich and FC Bayern Munich. Games will be hosted at Allianz Arena, where FC Bayern Munich plays its home games.\n\nThe NFL today announced it will return to Munich, Germany in 2026 and 2028 to play regular season games, as part of a multi-year partnership with the City of Munich and FC Bayern Munich.\n\nThe games will be played at the FC Bayern Munich Stadium.\n\n— Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) December 10, 2025\n\nFC Bayern Munich confirmed the partnership, with the mayor of Munich, Verena Dietl, expressing excitement over \"spreading the enthusiasm\" for American football in the city.\n\n\"I’m delighted about the extension of our contract with the NFL and it once again shows the importance and strength of Munich as a sporting city. The previous games not only won the hearts of the fans, but also strengthened our successful cooperation with the NFL. Together, we’re committed to promoting American football in Germany and spreading the enthusiasm for the sport far beyond the stadiums. I'm looking forward to the upcoming games in 2026 and 2028, which will not only bring top-class sport, but also valuable impetus for grassroots sport in our city.\"\n\nThe NFL has played regular-season games in Munich two other times. The Seattle Seahawks and Tampa Bay Buccaneers played at Allianz Arena in 2022, with the Bucs coming out on top. Two years later, the Carolina Panthers beat the New York Giants in Munich.\n\nGermany is no stranger to hosting NFL games at this point. In addition to those two contests, the Indianapolis Colts and Atlanta Falcons played a regular season game in Berlin, Germany earlier this year. The Colts won thanks to a tremendous performance from running back Jonathan Taylor.\n\nThe NFL has not announced which teams will take part in the Munich game in 2026 or 2028.\n\nIn recent years, the NFL has pushed to expand play outside the United States. The league has scheduled a number of international games each year, with six taking place during the 2025 NFL season. The NFL has played at least one game in the United Kingdom regularly since the 2007 season and has expanded international play to Brazil, Spain and Mexico, among other countries, in recent seasons.\n\nThe 2026 Munich game marks one of six international games announced by the NFL for next season. In addition to playing in Germany next year, the NFL will also play in Australia, Brazil and Mexico. The league will also play two games in the United Kingdom in 2026.\n\nThe league announced the Los Angeles Rams will play in the Australia game and that the Jacksonville Jaguars will appear in one of the games in the United Kingdom, but have not revealed any other teams taking part in international games next season.",

    "fullText": "Jake Paul is set to face Anthony Joshua on Netflix next Friday December 19th, and everyone is very excited to see ‘“The Problem Child”’ encounter a problem he probably can’t solve. For years he’s prayed on older, over the hill MMA fighters like Tyron Woodley and Anderson Silva. Now he faces a legitimate two-time heavyweight and Olympic boxing champion.\n\nWith that at the top of the card, it’s unsurprising that people have largely forgotten about much of the undercard. But there’s some interesting stuff there, including the aforementioned Woodley and Silva fighting each other in a boxing match.\n\nWoodley has come closer than anyone else to knocking out Paul, nearly derailing the YouTuber-turned-boxer’s hype train in their first 2021 fight. He hopes to prove he’s still got it against “The Spider,” and he’s had some surprising help preparing for the fight.\n\nTyron Woodley may have biggest balls in MMA. Respect to both OGs pic.twitter.com/dnaFINl9ld\n\n— Jake Paul (@jakepaul) November 21, 2025\n\n“I’m doing [Road House 2] right now, so a lot of us are training and getting ready for fight scenes,” Woodley told BettingLouge. “There are a lot of martial artists around, and specifically Michael ‘Venom’ Page, who is a perfect replica to train with to get ready for Anderson.”\n\n“More than just a fighter, he’s got a phenomenal mind for the sport,” Woodley said of “MVP.” “He’s almost stepped into a coaching role for me, especially with accountability. I feel comfortable with him saying, ‘You need to do this more, don’t do that,’ because he fights a similar style to Silva: flashy, elusive, open-space striker, very quick, hard to hit, hard to grab.”\n\n“Pinning him in a corner of the ring, landing shots on him, dealing with his unpredictability gives you the same type of anxiety someone would feel preparing for Anderson.”\n\nI’ll never forget that time when Tyron Woodley rocked Jake Paul and had the chance to end him but didn’t pull the trigger 🤔 pic.twitter.com/jKOUqZycQy\n\n— Moslee (@thefan763922) November 24, 2025\n\nWoodley promised that his fight with Silva will ‘steal the show,’ and he needs a big performance to prove he’s still capable of victory. His last win came in 2018 against Darren Till. Following that he lost four in a row to close out his UFC career and then dropped two boxing matches to Jake Paul.\n\n“I get a chance to beat somebody that I feel like is a legend,” Woodley said. “And I want to be left as a legend. Like, some people may say, ‘Okay, you’re already a legend.’ But I don’t feel that way yet. And I feel like beating somebody like Anderson Silva gives me a fight and a victory that I’m proud of.”\n\n“My kids will benefit from it, because they’ll see their dad succeed, and bounce back, and they’ll see the comeback season, but this is for me. It’s not personal against him, but it’s personal for me going out there and not holding back, and letting go, and freeing my hands up, it’s been a chain that I’ve always wanted to break.”\n\nWoodley has always had a piston of a right hand but got strangely tentative using it in the latter part of his career. When he hit Paul with it in their first fight, he didn’t jump on the Disney kid. He held back and it cost him the fight. Is “T-Wood” finally in a place where he’s ready to go out there and fire at will? Against a dangerous counter-striker like Silva, it could be dangerous.\n\nNo guts, no glory, and Woodley sounds like he really wants that glory.",

    "fullText": "Magic's Desmond Bane offers $35,000 explanation for his NBA Cup outburst vs. Heat originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Orlando Magic trailed 15-0 on Tuesday night in the NBA Cup quarterfinal round to the Miami Heat.\n\nThat's when Desmond Bane took over.\n\nAnd by the end of the night, the Magic had made up for their early stumble and won, 117-108. Bane was the story of the evening.\n\nBane dropped 37 points, making 14-of-24 shots from the floor, including 6-for-9 in a blistering showing from beyond the 3-point line.\n\nHe finished at the rim through contact and showed patience on multiple different pump fake moves beyond the arc to free himself up for shots.\n\nBane added six rebounds and five assists as he stepped up in the absence of Franz Wagner, who is out with a left leg injury.\n\nMORE: AJ Dybantsa makes basketball history only ever done by Stephen Curry\n\nAfter the game, Bane gave a simple explanation for why he had been so motivated.\n\n“I just lost $35,000,\" he told reporters. \"I gotta go get it back somehow.”\n\nBane is referencing the amount he was fined for throwing the basketball at Knicks forward OG Anunoby in the Magic's most recent game.\n\nEach advancement in the NBA Cup is worth money (more than $35,000, so Bane even has some spare change when all is said and done).\n\nThe Magic will take on the New York Knicks in the NBA Cup semifinals on Saturday in Las Vegas. Bane and Anunoby will be right back out there on the floor against one another. Should make for some good drama.\n\n3 Eastern Conference teams chasing after Anthony Davis trade\n\nPelicans' Derik Queen puts up crazy numbers only done in recent NBA history by LeBron James, Nikola Jokic\n\nRich Paul makes the LeBron James trade plans clear",

    "fullText": "Lazio have identified Atletico Madrid benchwarmer Giacomo Raspadori as their ultimate January dream, but funding the operation amidst their challenging financial situation won’t be easy.\n\nMaurizio Sarri believes the former Napoli star is the ideal striker for his system thanks to his slick movement and remarkable versatility. Moreover, the 25-year-old is keen to return to Italy, as his lack of playing time in Diego Simeone’s team could hamper his chances with the national team ahead of March’s playoffs and potentially in the World Cup, if Italy were to qualify.\n\nGiacomo Raspadori (Photo by Alessandro Sabattini/Getty Images)\n\nAccording to Il Messaggero, Lazio will most likely have to operate within ‘zero cost’ parameters in January, meaning they would only be able to sign players by selling others. They also have to register circa €25-30 million in capital gains before March 31 to avoid another transfer ban ahead of next summer, as the cost-to-revenue measure will drop from 80% to 70% next season.\n\nThe source believes that Lazio are hoping to cash in on Taty Castellanos, whose departure would make way for Raspadori’s arrival. The Roman newspaper claims that West Ham are preparing to make a move for the 27-year-old in January, although he’s not the only striker on their shortlist. The Hammers are also keeping tabs on struggling Milan centre-forward Santiago Gimenez.\n\nThe report claims that Castellanos would be willing to leave Lazio, as he hasn’t been enjoying his football under Sarri, even though he remains his first-choice striker.\n\nThe source insists Raspadori’s move would be feasible in this case, as Lazio would be able to afford his salary (€3m per year), having already registered a €1.2 million saving from selling Loum Tchaouna and Nicolo Casale in the summer, while Taty’s departure would free another €2.2 million on the wage bill.\n\nThe alternative plan for Lazio would be to sell Tijjani Noslin rather than Castellanos. But in this case, they would only be able to afford Raspadori on loan, and it remains unclear if Atletico Madrid would be open to this formula.",

    "fullText": "Palmeiras has shaken up the Brazilian football market this Wednesday by officially announcing the renewal of the contract of its successful coach, Abel Ferreira, until the end of 2027. This announcement puts an end to speculation about his future and consolidates the Alviverde’s sporting project for three more years.\n\nThe extension of the agreement between the club and the coaching staff, which was originally set to expire on the 31st of this month, is a resounding show of confidence and total alignment between the board and the Portuguese strategist. The new contract maintains the same salary and bonuses as the previous deal, a detail that highlights the stability of the relationship.\n\nA nossa história continua! 💚🇵🇹 pic.twitter.com/eJCXwr73xd\n\n— SE Palmeiras (@Palmeiras) December 10, 2025\n\nHowever, the most relevant point of the agreement is the absence of a termination compensation clause, neither in favor of the coach nor the club, demonstrating a mutual commitment that goes beyond contractual formalities. This condition is unusual in elite football and reflects the deep connection that exists.\n\nSince his arrival in October 2020, Ferreira has become a living legend at Palmeiras. In fact, he is the coach with the most consecutive matches in the club’s history, totaling 395 games managed. His record includes the impressive number of ten titles, consolidating a golden era for Verdão.\n\nWith an overall record of 229 victories, 93 draws, and 74 defeats, and an average of more than one title every 40 matches, the continuity of Abel Ferreira is seen by fans and the press as the best news to keep adding successes and maintaining Palmeiras at the top of South America.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "fullText": "This story is part of the IndyStar project \"Only woman in the room:\" How Indy became top city in nation for women sports execs\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- These five women have combined for more than 125 years of experience in sports careers and beyond. We asked them to give their best advice, lessons learned and how to navigate being a woman in the male-dominated sports industry.\n\nTitle: Chief operating officer of USA Track & Field since 2012\n\nNotable career stop: Washington spent five years with the U.S. Department of Labor, starting as a staff attorney and ending her tenure as deputy associate general counsel.\n\nCareer highlight: Washington was a key figure as USA Track & Field was determining whether to move its national headquarters from Indianapolis. The organization announced last year it would remain in the city and move into IU Indy's new James T. Morris arena in the fall of 2026.\n\n\"Renee deserves a lot of credit for what they've been able to accomplish,\" said Julie Roe Lach, executive vice president of Pacers Sports & Entertainment, \"including choosing to keep their headquarters in Indianapolis.\"\n\nAdvice for younger self: \"I say it to young people all the time, the world is not over tomorrow. You think that you've got to decide what you're going to do now, and you don't. There is time. There's always a new chapter you can write.\"\n\nAdvice for women: \"You can be competitive as women, but if you're going to do that, be competitive against the whole field, not just the women in the field. That is just so important.\"\n\nMaking a mark: \"You have to understand the larger picture in almost anything that you do, which means that you have to ask questions and you have to be inquisitive. And that makes you do your job not just efficiently, you want to go beyond being efficient. It helps you know your organization, and it helps make you of more value than you might have ever thought.\"\n\nTitle: President of Andretti Global, chief operating officer of TWG Motorsports\n\nNotable career stop: Gregory spent nearly 14 years with NASCAR as executive vice president and chief marketing and content officer.\n\nFor most of Gregory's career, she's been the only woman or one of few women in the room, and she's felt eyes looking at her, though she said she never had an overt incident where she felt unfairly treated because of her gender. Early on, she would sit off to the side of the room, instead of at the table, because she didn't have the experience or confidence to be there.\n\nAdvice for women: \"There were times when you kind of look around and say, 'I can't pay attention to the fact that I'm the only woman in the room. I just need to do a good job and prove myself and deliver on my own merits and not get sidetracked and worried about the fact that you might be the only one.' You have to kind of just plow through that.\"\n\nStill a way to go: \"You see this explosion in women's sports, which is fantastic, and the fan consumption, and that's going to help. But when you get into some of the day in, day out, it's not quite as far along as you would think. It's going to catch up, but we still have some work to do. We used to say it doesn't have a finish line at NASCAR and that was on diversity in general. You have to be deliberate about it.\"\n\nBringing the A game: \"As women in our various fields, you have to be prepared. You have to be better, in my opinion. And you've got to come with your A game all the time, and that does put a lot of pressure on you. But when you do that, you perform better, and then you gain more credibility, and then you have that reputation to build on, but you've got to invest the time in that up front.\"\n\nTitle: Senior vice president Penske Entertainment, leading marketing, branding, communications, content and broadcast across the IndyCar series and at Indianapolis Motor Speedway\n\nNotable career stop: Melangton was the second woman in history to lead a Super Bowl as the CEO and president of the 2012 Indianapolis Super Bowl Host Committee. She once had a guy come up to her at a funeral and say, \"Are you that lady running the Super Bowl? That's just crazy to me that they hired a woman.\"\n\n\"And I started laughing,\" Melangton said. \"And instead of being offended, I said, 'Tell me why it's crazy.'\"\n\nLesson learned: Early in her career, Melangton was working for Indiana Sports Corp. as director of events and was asked to help create the Big Ten women's basketball tournament. She went to work with the league negotiating, discussing, planning and, in 1995, it was set. The first tournament would be played at Hinkle Fieldhouse.\n\n\"It was so funny, I didn't know anything about basketball. And the first day, the athletes were throwing the balls out and they said, 'Did somebody break all these balls in?'\" Melangton said. \"I thought, 'What? I don't know anything about that.'\" Melangton and her staff stayed up all night bouncing the basketballs on the court to get them broken in for the games the next day.\n\nAdvice for women: \"Be the most confident person in the room, be better than everybody else, and it takes gender off the table.\"\n\nIn the eyes of her colleagues: \"The authenticity that Allison brings to all of her relationships, whether she knows you for many, many years or is new, there's a confidence and a comfort level that she provides to other women, other female leaders that I think is just amazing,\" said Gregory. \"It's something that motivates me. She leads by example.\"\n\nTitle: Executive vice president of Pacers Sports & Entertainment\n\nNotable career stop: Lach spent more than a decade as commissioner of the Horizon League before being hired by the Pacers in October.\n\nHer start in sports: \"Basketball was always my love, from middle school. They say, 'When you find your passion, you lose yourself while you're doing it,' and I would just lose myself in the midst of the game because I just loved it.\" Lach was a basketball All-Star at Millikin University.\n\nSome of Lach's favorite memories growing up happened on Sundays. The family would go to church, go home and watch WWF, then her dad would drop her off at the gym for pickup games. She'd wait on the sideline to get chosen on a team.\n\n\"I was always the only girl, but it didn't bother me because I could play, I could hang. You'd have to put up with some of the usual shenanigans, but I learned a lot,\" Lach said. \"My dad's proudest moment and his hardest moment was when I got picked ahead of him. But that was always the joke. He'd say, 'I knew you'd finally made it when they were picking you because they wanted to win.'\"\n\nLach was part of creating Indiana Sports Corp.'s 2050 vision, which included making Indy the women's sports capital of the world.\n\n\"No city has claimed it, because no city has done, I would argue, as much as we've already done,\" she said. \"And it's not just sporting events, although that's important. It's women leading in sports.\"\n\nProudest accomplishment: \"It's probably more behind the curtain. Those of us, especially in sports, get emails or calls or are approached by students or people that want to work in sports. I have coffee or Zooms or calls with people at least once or twice a week looking for some mentoring of how do you break in? it is definitely a pay it forward type deal, but it's the right thing to do. I think we all have a duty, and I think that's something that matters.\"\n\nTitle: Owner of Baughman Consulting, which specializes in sports management, bid concept and creation, hospitality and special events. She most recently was lead event director for WNBA All-Star 2025.\n\nNotable career stop: Baughman spent nearly 22 years at Indiana Sports Corp., ending her tenure as senior vice president. Baughman has been a part of putting on Indy's biggest sporting events. Among them the Super Bowl in 2012, the NBA All-Star Game in 2024, the National College Football Playoff in 2022 and so many others.\n\nWhen college football's biggest game was played in Indy, Baughman held the title of president of the 2022 College Football Playoff Host Committee. When she got the job, she had a sense of pride. She knew she had proven herself.\n\n\"It was more just like, 'You're really good at this. We trust you. We want you to do this.' Not, 'You're a woman and we should consider putting a woman in the position,'\" she said. \"Which to me is really important because I want to be the best person doing what I'm doing not the best woman doing something.\"\n\nAsk questions: \"There's so much to be learned from other people. And I feel like no one knows everything. And to be genuine in what you're knowledgeable about and what you think you have a fair opinion on. And when you're really seeking some guidance, that doesn't make you weak or less. It actually is really smart.\"\n\nAt the WNBA All-Star weekend this year, Baughman could be seen rolling carts, helping set up and tearing down, carrying boxes and inventorying T-shirts.\n\n\"Work your tail off. Do everything. Don't be like, 'Oh, I manage, I don't do those things.' Do whatever you need to do and help other people learn how to do it by doing it with them,\" Baughman said. \"I don't really like layers and titles. You get a much better result if you can get people to do things collectively as a group, because it feels more like a shared outcome at the end of the day.\"\n\nSign of a good leader: \"Let other people shine, and get out of the way sometimes.\"\n\nIn the eyes of her colleagues: \"Susan is so creative. So many of the creative things you see in the city related to sports are all her,\" said Melangton. \"She is deeply passionate and pours her entire self into whatever she's working on.\"\n\nFollow IndyStar sports reporter Dana Benbow on X: @DanaBenbow.

    "fullText": "The Miami Dolphins have climbed back from the 1-5 hole they dug for themselves to start the season — finding themselves just one game back of an even .500 record. They can inch closer to an improbable playoff berth by defeating the Pittsburgh Steelers on Monday Night Football this upcoming Monday. It won’t be easy, but if the team plays like they played against the New York Jets this past Sunday, it is certainly possible.\n\nAgainst the Jets in week fourteen, the Dolphins matched their largest win margin of the 2025 season — downing New York by a score of 34-10. Earlier this year, the Dolphins secured their second victory of the season by defeating the Atlanta Falcons by the same score.\n\nIn that game, Miami out-rushed the Falcons 141 yards to just 45, holding star back Bijan Robinson to just 25 yards on the ground. This past week, the Dolphins out-rushed the Jets 239 yards to 65. Noticing a pattern?\n\nThis week’s Fins Up player is second-year running back Jaylen Wright. After electric runner De’Von Achane left the game late in the second quarter with a rib injury, Wright took over as Miami’s lead back and led the team with some tough runs. He amassed 107 yards rushing on 24 carries — good for 4.5 yards per carry — and a rushing score.\n\nSunday’s yardage total was easily Wright’s best on the season — surpassing the 28 yards he had against Atlanta in the aforementioned contest. The Dolphins will be happy to have his services this week — especially if Achane is hampered by the rib ailment he incurred against New York.\n\nThis week’s Fins Down player is wide receiver Nick Westbrook-Ikinhe. NWI hasn’t caught a pass for the Dolphins since their victory over the Buffalo Bills on November 9th, over a full month ago. In fact, the 2025 free agent addition has only caught 11 passes for the Dolphins all season long after nabbing 32 for the Titans last year. He also had 9 receiving touchdowns last year in Tennessee, yet has none for Miami this season.\n\nBut it isn’t just his lack of production on the field that is hurting Miami. He is in danger of costing the Dolphins a mid-round compensatory pick with the playing time he’s receiving.\n\nMike McDaniel needs to have a care about how he plays Nick Westbrook-Ikhine over the next 4 games.\n\nTheir 4th round compensatory pick from losing Jevon Holland is very much in danger, and if NWI gets even 40 more snaps the rest of the year, can probably kiss that pick goodbye.\n\n— Chris Kouffman (@ckparrot) December 8, 2025\n\nWith the receiver’s inefficiency on the field, it’s probably time to give his blocking snaps to Cedrick Wilson Jr. in order to preserve the extra 4th round selection Miami is in line for in the upcoming draft.",

    "description": "AEW star Bryan Danielson explains why he wasn't bothered by his WWE WrestleMania 28 loss, which saw him get beaten by Sheamus in eighteen seconds",
    "fullText": "It's hard to believe that the moment that arguably kickstarted Bryan Danielson to WWE, and later AEW superstardom, wasn't when he won the Undisputed Championship at WrestleMania 30, but was a moment that left fans in the uproar. Indeed, Danielson's success story can be traced back to a WrestleMania 28 match with Sheamus, where the latter defeated Danielson to win the World Heavyweight Championship in 18 seconds. It was a booking decision seemingly made to get Sheamus over, only it instead rallied the fans around the heel Danielson, leading to a groundswell of support that has arguably continued to this day.\n\nAppearing on \"Insight with Chris Van Vliet,\" Danielson reminisced on the moment, even sharing a funny interaction with a co-worker backstage after the loss. He also explained why the months that followed led to him not being all that upset with how things turned out.\n\n\"When they had Sheamus beat me in 18 seconds at WrestleMania...28 maybe...the fans were just 'Yesing!' like crazy when I went out there,\" Danielson said. \"You could tell they were bummed when the match was so short. Then I walked to the back and The Great Khali of all people was like 'That was f*****g b******t!' And I was like 'Oh! Khali, I didn't know you cared. Thank you!' But then, like, the next night I was like 'Okay, well, there's a lot of people 'Yesing!'' But it just kept going. That was kind of...when after a couple of months after that, and it was still happening, I was like 'Okay. This is going to be here for a bit.'\"\n\nEven if it hadn't worked out that way, Danielson still seemed to indicate that the loss wouldn't have bothered him too much. Though he admitted that he was confused by WWE's decision at the time, he also admitted he didn't fight the decision, partially because it wasn't in his nature to begin with, and also because he feels that isn't the best course. He then pointed to an AEW star and former rival of his as an example of how to handle situations like that.\n\n\"I've never been somebody who's like 'Wait a second, why would you beat me in 18 seconds?'\" Danielson said. \"Or 'Why would you just beat me with one move?' or whatever. I was like 'Okay, that's the creative direction. I'm going to do the best I can with it.' I find that a lot of people put up stinks about a lot of things, whatever it is...You could put up a little resistance if you really don't like something.\n\n\"But then if this is what the boss wants, you're better off to do your absolute best at what the boss wants, and then try to get over from that. I think a great example in AEW is Swerve Strickland. He came in and he lost a lot of matches. But it was always 'Yes sir Tony. Whatever you need, I'll go out there and do.' And now look at him. He's main evented PPV's. He's a World Champion. He's fantastic.\"\n\nIf you use any of the quotes in this article, please credit \"Insight with Chris Van Vliet\" and provide an h/t to Wrestling Inc. for the transcription\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "title": "Roundtable: Reflecting on the 2025 UVA football seasons.",
    "description": "Discussing the UVA season in the context of the ACC Championship loss.",
    "fullText": "Our contributors at Streaking the Lawn answered the following question:\n\nWith Virginia football falling short of a conference title last Saturday, and in the fashion that they did, what is your sentiment on the 2025 season as a whole and the program moving forward? How much does that single performance/result change things?\n\nEvery fan is entitled to their own outlook, but the way I see it, we have to strike a balance between our initial expectations of the season and our changing expectations once we have that taste of success. While the legacy of this 2025 team will forever be tainted, it also completely raised the standard of the program, following years of work from Carla Williams and the administration with on-field results. I think the success of the program in the next four to six years will ultimately determine how we perceive 2025 Virginia football.\n\nI will be forever grateful for this UVA team for bringing Virginia football into the national spotlight. It brought the community together and produced more interest in our games than at any point that I’ve been a fan.\n\nSome examples include the field storming versus Florida State and the decisive victory against Virginia Tech.\n\nHowever, the legacy of this team will be determined by where the program goes from here. Was this a flash in the pan or the start of the turnaround of Virginia football (reminiscent of Indiana)? Currently, UVA is ranked last in the ACC recruiting rankings for next year. I fully anticipate a large portal presence, but the likelihood of continuing to hit home runs like we did here is unlikely.\n\nThe future is uncertain, but there’s more reason for optimism now than there has been since the 2019 run to the conference championship game.\n\nDan and Grayson’s point that this season, and Saturday night’s loss, will be judged in the context of the next ~five years of UVA football is a good one.\n\nUntil I’ve seen the ‘Hoos be a year-over-year ACC contender, especially on the high school recruiting front (as Grayson noted), I’m going to remain quite despondent about the loss to Duke in the ACC Championship. Losing to a team the ‘Hoos beat by three scores three weeks prior is a disappointment.\n\nThis program may never have an easier path to a conference championship. 10 wins is great, this is an all-time season that, as a fan, I’ll always be grateful for. But that bitter taste will be there for me until the program gets back and gets the job done.\n\nThis year’s talent launched Virginia into the national conversation. Despite how the season ended, I am pleased to see such a turnaround season for the ‘Hoos. To have won the ACC Championship would have exceeded my expectations, so I certainly can’t say I’m disappointed. Still, I’m cautiously optimistic for the future. As a skeptic of the current college sports landscape, I interpreted a lot of this year’s success to be largely a product of recruiting.\n\nThe loss to Duke, in my eyes, highlighted some questionable in-game coaching that reflects the staff’s needed areas of improvement. Long-term success, especially with returning players, would prove me wrong, but for now, I credit the season to talent. I believe the program and coaching staff have more work to do.\n\nI think two things can be true in that this season was an overall success, but fans also have every right to be upset and frustrated with not getting a W on Saturday night. It’s important to remember where this program was a season ago as a 5-7 team.\n\nThere’s no doubt the ‘Hoos looked night and day different from a talent and mentality standpoint throughout this season, which warrants serious applause for what the staff and players were able to do in such a short time with so many new pieces. 2025 will go down as one of the best, most fun years the program has had. The guys played their tails off and truly believed they could win every game. That was crystal clear against the likes of FSU, Louisville, and VT. That has to carry serious weight when considering the totality of the season.\n\nAll that being said, boy, was this Duke game a punch to the gut. To me, Saturday night was a game where any and all accomplishments from this season had to go out the window. In a championship game, you just have to find a way to get the job done. No other way to say it. With the mentality of the program firmly set on winning a conference title, I think it’s rational that fans adjusted their expectations to align with that goal. And frankly, against an inconsistent Duke team, the ‘Hoos should have won that title.\n\nOverall, I think we’ll learn in the next couple of months what this season means for the near future, with how things go in portal season, from the types of guys that give UVA a serious look. Tony Elliott and co. have a shot to use this season as a springboard to long-term success and really shift how the program is seen from a national perspective, which is an exciting thought. Time will tell.\n\nThe 10-2 regular season exceeded even my most optimistic preseason expectations by a significant margin. Considering how rare a 10-win season is in Virginia football history, the 2025 team will rightfully be looked back upon as an all-timer. This team was a joy to watch and brought back real excitement among fans that was largely absent after winning only 11 total games in the first three years of the Tony Elliott era.\n\nThat said, this loss was a clear step backward for the ‘Hoos after it seemed they had taken a few steps forward this year, both by showing they could win close games and beating Virginia Tech in dominant fashion. As Zach said, they will likely never have an easier opportunity to win the ACC, let alone earn a spot in the College Football Playoff. Losing to a 7-5 Duke team to miss out on both of those things will be a mark on this program until at least the latter is achieved.\n\nAdditionally, if the staff doesn’t harness the momentum created by the on-field success and improve on the recruiting front, UVA risks quickly fading back into the state of national irrelevance that has characterized the majority of the past two-plus decades. Only sustained success is capable of reducing the sickening feeling of not capitalizing on such an incredible opportunity.",

    "title": "The Devils Should Target Ryan O’Reilly Before They Target Steven Stamkos",
    "description": "The Devils are interested in a couple veteran Nashville Predators. Here’s why only one of them is worth pursuing.",
    "fullText": "The trade winds are starting to blow in the NHL, and with the New Jersey Devils recent skid, cries have started coming out from all corners of the internet and the Devils fanbase for GM Tom Fitzgerald to do something before these recent struggles derails the season.\n\nElliotte Friedman reported Saturday that Fitzgerald is indeed looking around and gauging what the market looks like. Not only have the Devils been linked to Quinn Hughes, but they’ve also been linked to Ryan O’Reilly and Steven Stamkos of the Nashville Predators.\n\nI don’t really have much more else to add about the Quinn Hughes situation, as I’ve said my piece on that matter last week. Fitzgerald wouldn’t be doing his job if he wasn’t checking in on the availability of one of the best defensemen in the NHL….never mind the fact he’s also the brother of two players already on the Devils. The Devils having interest in Quinn Hughes isn’t some manufactured thing that is just being thrown out there willy nilly for clicks. It’s a very real possibility that it could happen, so of course Fitzgerald is going to check in there.\n\nWith that said, I haven’t said much about the Ryan O’Reilly and/or Steven Stamkos situation, aside from what I wrote about those players last season. But I think if it came down to one or the other, the choice is clear.\n\nThe Devils should prioritize O’Reilly over Stamkos.\n\nThe Devils went into the season with a plan of having Jack Hughes, Nico Hischier, and Cody Glass as their Top 3 centers, with Luke Glendening apparently winning the 4C job over Juho Lammikko after impressing in training camp on a PTO.\n\nAfter free agency came and went, I figured that the Devils plan was to make Dawson Mercer the 3C and have Cody Glass be the 4C, but apparently I was wrong.\n\nAll of this was always a questionable plan at best.\n\nSay what you will about Jack Hughes’s injury history, and say that you will about how fluky this year’s injury was with Hughes getting injured at a team dinner of all settings. Considering Hughes’s history, it would not have been unreasonable for Fitzgerald to come up with a better alternative than “just shift Mercer to center” in case Hughes missed time again. And sure enough, Hughes missed time again. It might be the flukiest of fluky flukes to ever fluke, but its still a failure from an organizational level to properly prepare for this potential scenario that had a realistic chance of happening.\n\nAdd in the fact that the Devils nearly let Cody Glass walk away in free agency before they thought better of it when it was apparent he would be scooped up quickly if he hit the open market. Add in the fact that Glass has his own injury history since coming to the Devils. Add in that Nico Hischier bears the brunt of playing in all situations and playing the toughest minutes of anyone on the roster. And add in the fact that the Devils plan for 4C was taking a flier on the winner of a training camp competition between a player who had been out of the NHL for a few seasons and a PTO signing.\n\nThis might be a bit of a simplistic take on my part, but its not a coincidence or an accident that when the Devils have looked their best this season, it has been when their centers were healthy and available. The top lines worked and all showed cohesion. It’s also not a coincidence or accident that Mercer himself has looked the best he’s looked when playing on Nico Hischier’s wing rather than centering his own line.\n\nNo, there’s no replacing a player like Jack Hughes when he misses time, but you give yourself a better shot of treading water when you have an NHL caliber option who can slide into that spot. Adding a player like O’Reilly would make a huge difference for this group. And what about when you get Hughes back? All of a sudden you have an embarrassment of riches at a critically important position. Where Ryan O’Reilly is an overqualified 3C and Cody Glass is an overqualified 4C.\n\nGo back and look at the center depth on the most recent Stanley Cup champions. Where the Panthers had Anton Lundell as their 3C throughout their run. Where the Golden Knights had some combination of Jack Eichel, Chandler Stephenson, and William Karlsson down the middle. Where the Lightning won their Cups with Yanni Gourde as their 3C, but they were also deep enough to move Anthony Cirelli or Brayden Point there when needed. Where until this season, the Avs weren’t the same after losing Nazem Kadri. I’d keep going on and on but you understand the point I’m trying to make.\n\nYou need to be deep down the middle if you want to be taken seriously as a championship contender. You need to be deep down the middle if you want to maximize the wingers you’ve brought in. The Devils are not.\n\nI’m not suggesting that Ryan O’Reilly is the same two-way player he was when he won a Selke trophy in St. Louis. He turns 35 years old later this season and while he’s still effective, he is approaching the 1200 game milestone.\n\nThat said, with 21 points in 28 games, he’s still more than capable of chipping in offensively. He’s more than capable of playing in all situations and holding his own.\n\nI’m also not suggesting that Nico Hischier isn’t capable of handling everything that he handles in his on-ice role. But wouldn’t Hischier potentially be more valuable to the Devils if the team had another alternative who could take some of those defensive obligations off of his plate? Jack Hughes is better defensively than he gets credit for, but nobody is going to confuse him for Patrice Bergeron in terms of being a Selke-caliber defensive forward. Cody Glass doesn’t contribute much on the penalty kill (he’s only played 2:58 there this year). Luke Glendening does play on the kill, but he’s a fairly limited player at this stage of his career. Anything you get from him offensively is a bonus.\n\nAdding a player like O’Reilly and leaning on him to play those minutes should have a positive impact on the Devils penalty kill, which ranks 17th in the league as of this writing. And it should give the Devils another option at 5v5 as well.\n\nSteven Stamkos was already on the decline when he left the Tampa Bay Lightning, and things haven’t looked better through his first season plus as a member of the Nashville Predators. He’s not really a center anymore, despite Predators coach Andrew Brunette shifting him between center and wing in an attempt to give them a spark. He doesn’t drive play anymore, he’s not shooting as much as he has in the past, he’s no longer an elite level skater, he’s not much of a defensive forward, and he no longer has elite level players alongside him like he did in Tampa.\n\nYes, Stamkos could potentially chip in a little bit offensively on the power play. And yes, he might look better playing with better players than Luke Evangelista on his line. I would guess that the Devils envision him playing alongside Jack Hughes and Jesper Bratt and burying the feeds that he used to get from elite level playmakers like Nikita Kucherov.\n\nBut the Devils don’t really need another overpaid player who barely does anything at 5v5. They already have one of those in Ondrej Palat, and Stamkos’s contract is even worse.\n\nThe 2025-26 Devils need stability down the middle more than they need a scoring winger. They needed this before Jack Hughes got hurt and that need is only exasperated the more we see they don’t have an answer at such a critically important position. And even if one believed the opposite was true, the last thing the Devils need is a soon-to-be 36-year-old Stamkos, who is under contract for $8M AAV for two more seasons after this one. I don’t even know how the Devils would make that contract fit given their current cap situation, but I know I want no part of that.\n\nOn the flip side, O’Reilly is under contract for $4.5M AAV for one more season after this one, which is more than reasonable for a middle six center. I get that with him being a year younger than Stamkos, he’s not exactly a spring chicken either, but I think its clear that O’Reilly has more left in the tank than Stamkos, and its not nearly as onerous a commitment either.\n\nObviously, this is all dependant on asking price, and there might wind up being other options that make themselves available as the season rolls along. But it certainly sounds like the Predators are open for business, and with how tight the NHL standings are, the teams that separate themselves from the pack are likely going to be the ones who are proactive fixing their issues with their rosters rather than being reactive and waiting until the deadline for prices to go down.\n\nWhat gives me pause is sitting by and doing nothing isn’t going to do anything to fix the issue. Not only is it not acceptable for this team and where they are on their timeline, I think we’ve seen enough mediocre to bad hockey to know that its not going to magically fix itself. I pointed out when I broke down every trade Fitzgerald has made that only once did he go out early in the season and make a trade to address a glaring hole. It was a bad one. It was acquiring Jon Gillies.",

In reality, if Denver needed another guard to step in, Throckmorton would presumably be the top backup for both spots.\n\nDE: John Franklin-Myers, Eyioma Uwazurike, Sai'vion Jones\n\nRoach is perhaps one of the best \"backup\" defensive linemen in the NFL.\n\nOLB1: Jonathon Cooper, Jonah Elliss\n\nOLB2: Nik Bonitto, Dondrea Tillman, Que Robinson\n\nElliss, Tillman and Robinson form quite the trio of rotational pass rushers behind starters Cooper and Bonitto.\n\nILB: Dre Greenlaw, Justin Strnad\n\nJustin Strnad served as a fill-in starter while Dre Greenlaw was sidelined earlier this year, and he filled in again after Alex Singleton underwent successful surgery for testicular cancer. Greenlaw and Singleton have since returned to the lineup and Strnad now plays a rotational role.\n\nCB1: Pat Surtain, Jahdae Barron, Reese Taylor\n\nCB2: Riley Moss, Kris Abrams-Draine\n\nSlot: Ja'Quan McMillian, Jahdae Barron\n\nSurtain returned to the lineup last week after missing three games with a pectoral injury.\n\nS: Talanoa Hufanga, P.J. Locke, JL Skinner\n\nKey, Skinner and Locke have played almost exclusively on special teams this season.\n\nKR: Marvin Mims, Jaleel McLaughlin, Tyler Badie\n\nWith four games remaining, Mims has quietly racked up 1,260 all-purpose yards, a career high.\n\nSocial: Follow Broncos Wire on Facebook and Twitter/X!

    "fullText": "The Mets lost closer Edwin Díaz to the reigning champions Dodgers, with the reliever agreeing to a three year, $69 million contract with Los Angeles and setting a new AAV record for relievers.\n\nThe Mets’ offer to Díaz was for three years and $66 million with some deferrals, though they expressed a willingness to improve the number.\n\nA few factors impacted the Mets’ ability to retain Díaz outside of the pure dollar amount at play.\n\nThe Dodgers’ deal with Díaz also includes some deferrals, about $4.5 million deferred per year.\n\nAnthony DiComo rounded up all the important bits of the Díaz signing and the fallout for the Mets.\n\nDevin Williams was surprised that Díaz did not return, and he expressed excitement at the opportunity to earn the closer role.\n\nDíaz wasn’t the only reliever the Mets lost, as Gregory Soto signed with the Pirates on a one-year, $7.75 million contract.\n\nThe Mets also made an offer to Kyle Schwarber before he re-signed with Philadelphia, offering around three years and $120 million for the free agent slugger.\n\nStar free agent Pete Alonso will now take up more of the spotlight with Schwarber off the board.\n\nThe Mets are reportedly reluctant to go past three years with Alonso.\n\nAnd while the Mets remain interested in a reunion with Alonso, other options exist and remain in play for the team.\n\nDespite the blows taken by the Mets, David Stearns is still optimistic about the team’s offseason.\n\nStearns still understands why Mets fans are feeling frustrated, especially in the wake of how 2025 ended.\n\nJohn Harper wrote about whether Stearns has a plan fans should trust and what things might be other valuable parts of contract decisions other than pure player value.\n\nThe Mets are willing to listen to trade offers for All-Star starter David Peterson, though the price will be considerable.\n\nThe draft lottery was held yesterday, and because the Mets landed outside of the protected top ten picks, the Mets’ pick was docked ten spots and will be 27th overall.\n\nThe Mets and Starling Marte reportedly have mutual interest in a reunion.\n\nHaving spent years with the Mets, Tommy Tanous has been hired by the Rockies as an assistant general manager.\n\nMLB.com looked at the fallout in the wake of the Díaz and Schwarber signings, including where the Mets go from here.\n\nKyle Schwarber returned to the Phillies, agreeing to a five-year, $150 million contract.\n\nHis contract is an anomaly in baseball, but Jayson Stark explained why it fits such an unique player.\n\nLeft hander Alec Gamboa and the Boston Red Sox agreed to a minor league split contract with an invite to spring training.\n\nThe Red Sox also traded infielder Vaughn Grissom to the Los Angeles Angels.\n\nThe Chicago White Sox landed the number one pick in the 2026 draft.\n\nAfter being traded to Detroit last season, Kyle Finnegan re-signed with the Tigers on a two-year contract worth $19 million.\n\nA Pod of Their Own was back with another episode.\n\nDecember 10th is a very busy trade day in Mets history, with three major trades taking place on this date.",

    "fullText": "The vast majority of the British press agrees that Liverpool were fortunate to be given a late penalty in their 1-0 victory over Inter in the Champions League on Wednesday evening, which sentenced Cristian Chivu’s side to their second consecutive defeat in the competition: ‘I’d be very disappointed if this went against me’.\n\nInter were beaten 1-0 in San Siro through an 88th-minute Dominik Szoboszlai penalty, which had been awarded after the slightest of shirt pulls on Florian Wirtz in the area by Nerazzurri centre-back Alessandro Bastoni.\n\nThe Italian press has not looked too kindly on referee Felix Zwayer, nor VAR Sören Storks, who were deemed ‘incompetent’ as a result of their decision to award a penalty on Tuesday night.\n\nMILAN, ITALY – DECEMBER 09: Dominik Szoboszlai of Liverpool FC scores their team’s first goal during the UEFA Champions League 2025/26 League Phase MD6 match between FC Internazionale Milano and Liverpool FC at Stadio San Siro on December 09, 2025 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\nThe majority of pundits in the UK agree that it was a harsh decision to award a penalty against Inter in the dying minutes of their eventual defeat against Liverpool.\n\n“Did they deserve to get that penalty? Probably not, but the fans won’t care,” said former Liverpool defender Stephen Warnock on BBC Radio 5 Live after full-time.\n\nClarence Seedorf, analysing the game on Amazon Prime in the UK, added: “The defender should not do that, it wasn’t needed at all, but definitely a light decision.”\n\nEven Jamie Carragher admitted that Liverpool were fortunate to be awarded the late spot kick: “I think I’d be very disappointed if this went against me or my team,” he said on CBS Sports Golazo on Tuesday night.\n\n“What I would say is, that I don’t think that’s a penalty, but if I was the Inter player or the manager, I’d say ‘what are you doing grabbing his shirt, giving the referee a decision to make?’ I don’t think it’s a penalty, but just don’t pull his shirt.  He’s got his back to goal, he’s going nowhere. So, he’s only got himself to blame there but I do think it was a little bit harsh.”",

    "title": "From Dan Lanning to Bob Chesney; ranking the top HC's in the CFP",
    "description": "With the College Football Playoffs fast approaching, we ranked the top head coaches in the field.",
    "fullText": "In football, the head coach's decisions have the ability to swing games, whether it's a head-scratching play-call or a botched end-of-game situation. Those decisions are magnified in a postseason setting, which is exactly the stakes of the College Football Playoff.\n\nThe best coaches are able to manage the game to their advantage, giving their players the best possible chance to go out and succeed. But others unintentionally find ways to undercut their players and team, resulting in a loss that could've been a win simply with better coaching.\n\nThe 2025 edition of the CFP features a number of high-level coaches.\n\nEven the head coaches of the Group of Five teams in the field, James Madison's Bob Chesney and Tulane's Jon Sumrall, will not be back at their respective programs after accepting Power 4 head coaching positions. Some have championship pedigree; others are just kicking open the door of their careers. One coach, due to the nature of college football in 2025, has never been a head coach but will be thrust into the spotlight come the first round.\n\nIn this piece, we'll be ranking each head coach participating in the CFP from 12 to 1, taking into account all the duties that it takes to be a head football coach in the playoff.\n\n2025 Team Record: 11-1, 7-1 SEC\n\nAs a result of Lane Kiffin's pre-CFP departure to LSU, Pete Golding was named the head coach of the Rebels both in the playoff and moving forward. Though he's fielded solid units during his three seasons as the defensive coordinator, it wouldn't be responsible to rank him anywhere else but 12th on this list, as he's never been the head coach for a game at the college level.\n\n2025 Team Record: 10-2, 6-2 ACC\n\nMario Cristobal as a recruiter and Mario Cristobal as a football coach are two different things and thus would place him at different spot on this list. But as a football coach, the former Ducks head man has made numerous questionable on-field decisions during his time with Miami. Let's not forget, two ACC losses had the Hurricanes relying on a win all the way back in August against a Notre Dame quarterback in CJ Carr making his first career start just to eke their way into the final at-large spot.\n\n2025 Team Record: 11-2, 8-1 AAC\n\nHaving accepted the head coaching job at Florida, this will be Jon Sumrall's final ride with the Green Wave. He's shown himself as someone who can turn programs around, as he took over a five-win Troy program in 2022 and immediately won 23 combined games in two seasons before taking the Tulane job. The Green Wave won 11 games before he got there and he's more than kept them afloat, elevating them to a playoff appearance. Despite making the CFP, Sumrall's team isn't particularly great at anything and is just 50th in scoring defense, his speciality. For those reasons, Sumrall, still a very good coach and worthy of the Gators' job, lands at No. 10.\n\n2025 Team Record: 12-1, 9-0 Sun Belt Conference\n\nTaking over the James Madison program ahead of 2024 season after leading Holy Cross to five consecutive Patriot League titles, the winning ways have continued for the Dukes under Bob Chesney. Curt Cignetti lifted up the program as they became an FBS team in 2022, and Chesney has done even better. The 48-year-old is still relatively on the younger side as a head coach and has proven himself to be a tremendous leader of men in his 16 years as a head coach — so much so that he was hired by UCLA to try to resurrect the Bruins' program.\n\n2025 Team Record: 11-1, 7-1 SEC\n\nIt's hard to argue with Mike Elko's record this season, but due to the disappointments of last season's 8-5 campaign and Las Vegas Bowl meltdown loss to the USC Trojans, it's hard to put him any higher on this list. A 7-5 season in 2023 at Duke managed to get him hired to lead the Aggies program and he's done what's asked of him in leading them to the playoff. But you're unlikely to hear Elko's name uttered amongst the inner circle of college football head coaches anytime soon.\n\n2025 Team Record: 12-1, 9-1 Big 12\n\nJoey McGuire's in a similar spot as Elko, as he's unlikely to be mentioned with the top head coaches in the sport. Despite that, he's done a good job with this Red Raiders team, albeit with an influx in NIL compensation and transfer portal talent. Regardless, McGuire is ultimately responsible for the coalition of the team as a whole and they've meshed about as well as anyone could've hoped.\n\n2025 Team Record: 10-3, 7-2 SEC\n\nDeBoar catches a lot of heat whenever Alabama loses, but it's always worth a reminder that he's following the legend of Nick Saban — who is un-followable and the Crimson Tide job was always going to be a tough one once he retired because the expectations are set through the roof. All things considered, DeBoer has handled it relatively well. Where he excels is on the offensive side of the ball, as he led an explosive Washington offense in 2023 to the national title game and has the Tide averaging over 30 points per game in the rugged SEC.\n\n2025 Team Record: 10-2, 6-2 SEC\n\nBrent Venables' coaching tenure at Oklahoma has been mired with two disappointing 6-7 seasons, but his defensive coaching prowess has been on full display in 2025, completely carrying him to a top five spot. Despite battling SEC teams for eight of their games, the Sooners' defense ranks seventh in scoring defense and ninth in scoring defense. Without those efforts on that side of the ball, Venables and Oklahoma wouldn't be anywhere close to the position they're in.\n\n2025 Team Record: 12-1, 9-1 Big Ten\n\nThere's a clear top four of head coaches in the CFP and Ryan Day just barely misses out on the top three. Yes, he has an 82-11 record, won a national championship last season and just extinguished his four-game losing streak to the rival Michigan Wolverines. But much of the Buckeyes' successes have been due to the coordinator and position coaches, who have been extremely highly-regarded. Day doesn't project as a \"leader of men\" type of coach nor as an X's and O's guy. He's the conductor of the whole show for Ohio State and deserves credit for the national title, but falls behind the following three coaches.\n\n2025 Team Record: 12-1, 8-1 SEC\n\nOne of the best things about Kirby Smart during his time at Georgia has been that the Bulldogs have an identity. They know exactly who they are as a team, as they'll punch you in the mouth and drag you to the deep end. It's a mentality thing and one that Smart has instilled within the culture of his program. He's won two national championships and come close to more, with this season presenting itself as another opportunity. Off-the-field player issues aside, Smart is one of the golden standards of head football coaches in the sport.\n\n2025 Team Record: 11-1, 8-1 Big Ten\n\nDan Lanning's defensive prowess showed perhaps this season more than any other during his four-year tenure with the Oregon Ducks, but it was his ability to motivate his players that stuck out the most. Any slight against his program gets used to his advantage, as his motivational tactics are top notch. The only thing missing for Lanning — though to be fair it is just his fourth season — is postseason success, as he hasn't led the Ducks to a playoff win. He'll have a good chance to do so in Oregon's first-round matchup with Chesney's James Madison squad.\n\n2025 Team Record: 13-0, 10-0 Big Ten\n\nI mean, just Google him. All Curt Cignetti does is win, and he's done it at every stop. He elevated James Madison into an 11-win team in his second season and has completely uplifted the entire Indiana program from the bottom of the conference and resigned to being a \"basketball school\" to what it is today: champions of the Big Ten and the No. 1 seed in the CFP. Meanwhile, he had a scowl on his face after the conference title game. Cignetti is never satisfied with success and has him team on the path of winning a national championship.\n\nContact/Follow @Ducks_Wire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Oregon Ducks news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Ducks Wire: Ranking the top head coaches in the 2025 CFP field",

    "fullText": "Daniel Jones' injury might push him back to the Minnesota Vikings originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Indianapolis Colts are obviously most concerned with the near-term question of who they're going to have to play quarterback this week.\n\nBut the Daniel Jones injury, a torn Achilles that ended his season and also puts Week 1 of next season in doubt, has created a lot of other questions, too.\n\nThe big dilemma here is that Jones is on a one-year contract. He's a free agent when the season ends.\n\nDo the Colts re-sign a guy on a torn Achilles? Where does Jones find the most security and comfort to rehab?\n\nMORE: These 4 legends played in NFL, MLB, NHL as grandfathers before Philip Rivers\n\nESPN's Dan Graziano and Jeremy Fowler went back and forth on this in a new debate article on Wednesday, with them both surmising that the Colts are the most logical landing spot on some sort of shorter deal.\n\nBut they've posited one other option: the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nJones spent the second half of the 2024 season with Minnesota as a backup after being released by the Giants.\n\n\"Another is that it would make sense for him to go back to Minnesota, where he finished last season as Sam Darnold's backup, and rehab there with a staff that knows him and wanted to retain him but couldn't guarantee him the starting job this past offseason,\" Graziano wrote.\n\nMORE: How the 6-7 meme sums up the Chiefs' season perfectly\n\nThat's a fascinating idea. If Jones went to Minnesota, he'd be a veteran that could eventually challenge J.J. McCarthy for his starting job.\n\nJones' recovery timeline would even potentially give McCarthy at least a few weeks at the start of next season to prove whether he deserves to keep the gig or not. But by the time Jones was ready to play, the Vikings would likely have their answer.\n\nIt's an unfortunate timing for Jones and the Colts, but it definitely raises the level of uncertainty and intrigue for the offseason ahead.\n\nTexas Tech commit breaks 72-year old TX HS football rushing record\n\nChargers' Justin Herberts drawing ire for postgame interview handling\n\nChet Holmgren shows the proper respect to Red Panda\n\nNotre Dame rushed for more yards in the SEC title game than Alabama\n\nJalen Hurts made the worst play in fantasy football history\n\nHow the Buffalo Bills at home in the snow in December are an unbreakable streak",

    "fullText": "Only 16 teams remain in the NCAA volleyball tournament. The process to arrive at this moment was filled with very exciting volleyball and wonderful competition. The first round was the most exciting in years, with eight upset wins of unseeded teams ousting a nationally seeded opponent, while an additional eight matches went all the distance in a forced fifth set. This is twice as many as the 2024 tournament, when only four matches went to five sets.\n\nThe eighth seeded teams had a challenging first round. UCLA went to five sets with Georgia Tech, won the fifth and moved on. San Diego went to five sets with Kansas State, lost the fifth set and went home. Xavier lost in three sets to Michigan and Penn State won in four sets over South Florida.\n\nThe seven seeds in the tournament had an even worse time, all four of the seven seeds were defeated by an unseeded team in the first round. Those seventh seeds were Tennessee, South Dakota State, Rice and Western Kentucky. Tennessee lost to Utah State in five sets. This was Nebraska transfer Hayden Kubik’s senior season, a tough way to go out.\n\nThe former Husker outside hitter finished her college career as an offensive and defensive leader for Tennessee. This loss is even tougher for the Lady Volunteers to take, given that they also lost in five sets in the first round in 2024, that time to Georgia Tech.\n\nThe rest of the seven seed results were: South Dakota lost in four sets to Arizona. Rice met Florida in the first round and lost in three. Western Kentucky faced a very underestimated Marquette team (they looked like a 4 or 5 seed to me) and the Hill Toppers lost in three sets.\n\nThat is six first round upsets, the last two belong to a six seed and a five seed. Sixth seeded UTEP lost to North Carolina and Fifth seeded BYU lost to Cal Poly in five sets. Oh, Cal Poly! That segways right into the second round where Cal Poly produced their second upset again in five sets over #4 USC. Cal Poly, out of the Big West conference, is into the sweet 16 as the only unseeded team remaining. What a fun team to watch!\n\nThe next biggest upset was that of #5 UTEP by North Carolina. If you were watching scores or matches from the ACC this season you were not too surprised that UNC had upset potential in them. During the season they beat Florida, Georgia Tech and SMU. This was a talented team that seemed to have something to prove. I suppose they did that by winning in the first round. They met Wisconsin in the second round and lost 3-0. I’ll keep my eye on UNC next season.\n\nLouisville 3 vs Marquette 2 – This one went five and it was great volleyball to the very end. Louisville took the fifth set with a 15-12 score. The Marquette setter is a freshman and a native of Louisville and she was excellent in this match. One of the outside hitters for Louisville is Payton Peterson. She was announced to the volleyball world last season when she subbed in for the injured Anna DeBeer in late in the match against Pitt in the National Semi Finals. Peterson was great.\n\nThe storylines for this match kept building as Marquette kept coming after the 2024 National Runner up team. Marquette gave Louisville everything they had but stars like Chloe Chicoine, Nayelis Cabello and Cara Cresse were just too good on this night. Louisville advances to face Texas A&M.\n\nCreighton 3 vs UNI 1 – UNI went five sets in the 2024 tournament with the team we just talked about, Louisville. They are coached by Bobbi Peterson, the mom to above mentioned Payton Peterson. UNI is a well-coached team who matched up well with Louisville and Creighton because they pass and serve with the best of them. Teams that don’t have a ton of height pass accurately and play fast to gain the advantage. This was a strength against strength sort of match.\n\nUltimately Ava Martin of Creighton alongside Jaya Johnson and Kiara Reinhardt prevailed and won this match in four sets. They seemed to get better as the match went on which could mean good things in the next round. If Creighton is able to learn and adjust as they play, they can find success. They meet Arizona State in the next round.\n\nWhat was your favorite match in the first two rounds?\n\nBig West: started with 1, has 1 remaining \nBig East: started with 3, has 1 remaining\nB12: started with 10, has 2 remaining\nSEC: started with 6, has 3 remaining\nACC: started with 7, has 4 remaining\nBig Ten: started with 9, has 5 remaining\n\nDecember 11th (# are seeds in the last AVCA Coach’s Poll)\n#11 Creighton vs #8 Arizona State 12 pm CT\nCal Poly vs #2 Kentucky 2:30 pm CT\n#17 Minnesota vs #4 Pitt 6 pm CT\n#12 Purdue vs #7 SMU 8:30 pm CT\n\nDecember 12th\n#15 Indiana vs #3 Texas 11 am CT\n#10 Wisconsin vs #5 Stanford 1:30 pm CT\n#6 Texas A&M vs #9 Louisville 6 pm CT\n#16 Kansas vs #1 Nebraska 8:30 CT or 30 minutes after previous match\n\nDani Busboom Kelly Coaches Nebraska, played @ Nebraska\nKatie Schumacher Cawley Coaches Penn state @ Penn State \nSam Erger Coaches SMU, played @ Bowling Green\nEve Rackham Watt Coaches Tennessee, played @ UNC\nChristy Johnson-Lynch Coaches Iowa state, played @ Nebraska\nHeather Olmstead Coaches BYU, played @ Utah State\nLauren Ramatowski Coaches Tulsa, played @ Kansas State\nAmanda Berkley Coaches Loyola Chicago, played @ Wisconsin\nLyndsey Oates Coaches Northern Colorado, played @ LSU\nCaroline Walters Coaches Cal Poly, played @ Santa Clara\nSabrina King Coaches Princeton, played @ Princeton \nNancy Somera Coaches Fairfield, played @ USC\nBobbi Peterson Coaches UNI, played @ UNI\nLynze Roos Coaches Wofford, played @ Butler\nDebbie Humphreys Coaches Stephen F Austin, played @ Texas Tech\nJennifer Petrie Coaches San Diego, played @ William and Mary \nGenny Volpe Coaches Rice, played @ Texas A and M\nChristy Pfeffenberger Coaches Xavier, played @ Dayton \nErin Virtue Coaches Michigan, played @ Illinois\nJolene Shepardson Coaches USF, played @ USF\nCharita Stubbs Coaches Arizona, played @ Arizona \nBeth Launiere Coaches Utah, played @ Aquinas \nMichelle Collier Coaches Georgia Tech, played @ USF\n\nCome back to Cornnation.com tomorrow for a complete and detailed look at Nebraska’s next match versus Kansas.",

    "fullText": "Real Madrid host Manchester City in their sixth Champions League game of the season at the Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday night, with plenty more on the line than just qualification for the knockout rounds. Xabi Alonso is under serious pressure for his position, and there has been almost unanimous reporting that a negative result could cost him his job.\n\nTo add to Alonso’s headaches, he will be unable to field his best side. On Sunday, Eder Militao joined an injury list including Eduardo Camavinga, Dean Huijsen, David Alaba, Ferland Mendy, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Dani Carvajal. After breaking his finger against Celta Vigo, and suffering muscle discomfort, Kylian Mbappe is also a serious doubt, but has made the squad, as have youngsters Joan Martinez, Victor Valdepenas and Jorge Cestero.\n\n📋✅ ¡Nuestros convocados!\n🆚 @ManCityES pic.twitter.com/mpMLYALCc0\n\n— Real Madrid C.F. (@realmadrid) December 10, 2025\n\nDiario AS predict that it will be one of Mbappe or Gonzalo Garcia Torres that start up front with Vinicius Junior, while Marca seem to think a start is unlikely, and have Rodrygo Goes up front. There is plenty of uncertainty over the backline too, with AS expecting Fede Valverde at right-back, and Raul Asencio partnering Antonio Rudiger. Marca believe that Valverde will play in midfield, pushing out Dani Ceballos, and forcing Carreras into central defence, with Asencio at right-back.\n\nIt's a crucial day for #RealMadrid, as they face #mcfc in the #ChampionsLeague, with Xabi Alonso under serious pressure.\n\nThe big question mark is whether Kylian Mbappe will be fit, but Diario AS predict a surprise in midfield, with Dani Ceballos potentially returning to the XI. pic.twitter.com/jqB0H0anpY\n\n— Football España (@footballespana_) December 10, 2025\n\nOn the other side of things, Pep Guardiola is without just Mateo Kovacic. His main question mark appears to be over whether to start Rayan Cherki, in a more attacking move, or push Phil Foden forward to incorporate Tijjani Reijnders.\n\nAlonso was advised to ‘pee with his own’ by Guardiola before the match, but will no doubt be pointing at City’s full-back pairing of Nico O’Reilly and Matheus Nunes as potential areas of joy for his side.",

    "description": "A Yankees free agent spoke to NJ Advance Media this week.",
    "fullText": "ORLANDO, Fla. — Long-time Yankees pitcher Jonathan Loaisiga was up early Tuesday at his farmhouse near Managua, Nicaragua, which has a barn loaded with horses, chickens and his beloved bulls.\n\nThis was another important workday for the free agent reliever, who has recovered from his season-ending injury and is working to secure a fresh start with a new team after 10 years in the Yankees organization.\n\nThe Yankees are severing ties because they didn’t get enough return on investment due to Loaisiga’s history of injuries, but he has suitors offering major-league contracts because he can pitch as well as any reliever in the majors when he’s healthy.\n\nLoaisiga, 31, said he has offers from three National League clubs — the Cubs, Diamondbacks and Giants — all with a condition. He has to log a few innings in the next month or so in the Nicaraguan winter league. He doesn’t need great results facing inferior competition, but the clubs hoping for a signing want to make sure he’s healthy before making their contract offers official.\n\nOn Tuesday after breakfast, Loaisiga drove to downtown Managua to throw a bullpen in an empty 15,000-seat ballpark that used to be named for the best ballplayer ever to come out of his country, four-time All-Star pitcher and 245-game winner from 1976-1998 Dennis Martinez, aka El Presidente.\n\nLoaisiga just started throwing a few weeks ago in Houston after being shut down in August with a flexor strain, so the right-hander’s fastball velocity isn’t back to what it’s been when he’s been healthy, in the high-90s and up to 100. But he said he was whipping in heaters with good mechanics and feeling good throwing in the home bullpen at Estadio Nacional Soberani.\n\n“The only thing I worry about is staying healthy,” Loaisiga said by phone. “I know I can pitch. I just want to show everyone that I’m healthy and I can stay healthy.”\n\nLoaisiga began the 2025 season on the injured list as he finished his rehab from April 2024 surgery to repair his right UCL and a flexor strain and then he missed the last two months with two more injuries, first tightness in his back and then another flexor strain. In between, Loaisiga wasn’t consistent, going 0-1 with a 4.25 ERA in 30 outings.\n\nThis was the same sad story for a pitcher whose entire career has been plagued by injuries. He debuted as a Giants minor leaguer in 2013, then sat out two seasons with arm injuries before being released.\n\nLoaisiga signed with the Yankees in February 2016, then blew out his arm in his first game with Low-A Charleston and underwent Tommy John surgery. That was the first of 13 injured list stints during his decade in the Yankees organization, nine of them coming during his eight years as a big leaguer.\n\n“I’ve had a lot of bad luck,” Loaisiga said. “I hope it changes because I know how I can pitch when I’m healthy. I’m due for better luck.”\n\nThe Yankees kept Loaisiga for a decade because of his talent. He proved it in 2021 when he was a standout setup reliever going 8-4 with a 2.21 ERA in a career-high 57 outings.\n\nHis career numbers are pretty good, too. In 193 games, all for the Yankees, he has a 19-12 record with a 3.54 ERA.\n\nBut the injuries have prevented Loaisiga from pitching more than 30 games in all but two seasons. He made a combined 107 appearances during the 2021 and 2022 seasons, then just 50 over the last three years.\n\n“I’m hoping I’m done with injuries,” Loaisiga said. “I want to sign with someone and pitch like I can. The way I’m feeling, I’m confident it can happen next season. I’m working hard. I’m feeling good.”\n\nLoaisiga hopes to sign with a team by January, represent Nicaragua in the World Baseball Classic and then achieve something he’s never done as a big leaguer: Have a good season and stay off the injured list from start to finish.\n\n“I loved being a Yankee,” he said. “A lot of great memories. Wherever I go next, I want to pitch good and help my team win. And stay healthy. That’s most important.”",

    "description": "The Kansas City Chiefs will have needs at both running back and wide receiver to address during the offseason. As a result, an ESPN insider named Kansas City as a possible landing spots for Indianapolis Colts, New York Jets and Jacksonville Jaguars free agents.",
    "fullText": "ESPN insider names Chiefs as landing spot for Colts, Jets, Jaguars pending free agents originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nTwo positions the Kansas City Chiefs will have to take a long, hard look at this coming offseason are running back and wide receiver.\n\nAt running back, both Kareem Hunt and Isiah Pacheco are pending free agents, and neither one has been that good this season, so the Chiefs could use an upgrade.\n\nAt wide receiver, Kansas City desperately needs to add a deep threat to bring some explosiveness to an offense that has lacked it since Tyreek Hill was traded.\n\nIn their weekly NFL buzz article, ESPN's Dan Graziano and Jeremy Fowler agree that the Chiefs need to make a move at both positions.\n\nAs a result, Fowler suggests the Chiefs as possible landing spots for New York Jets running back Breece Hall, Jacksonville Jaguars rusher Travis Etienne, and Indianapolis Colts wide receiver Alec Pierce.\n\nThe Chiefs and Ravens are both teams that need a classic boundary receiver on the outside and could address that with one big move in free agency. George Pickens would be a significant upgrade in Baltimore, and Alec Pierce would satisfy that need in Kansas City, which has been starved for explosive playmaking on the outside since Tyreek Hill was traded after the 2021 season.\n\nBoth would be costly, and Pickens might be franchise tagged by Dallas. But if available, the Ravens could use some of their $40 million in 2026 cap space on Pickens, knowing John Harbaugh is good at managing big personalities. The Chiefs are much lower on space, sitting at minus-$42.8 million, but cuts are on the way for a team that might look drastically different this time next year. Also, adding an explosive running back such as Breece Hall or Travis Etienne Jr. is worth exploring for Kansas City.\n\nOf course, all three of those players are pending free agents, but we wouldn't expect all three to actually hit the open market.\n\nHall is the one we could see getting the franchise tag, which would enable the Jets to get something for him via trade instead of letting him walk for nothing.\n\nWe wouldn't rule out the Jets extending him, either, although Hall might not be amenable to that and could want a change of scenery from the lowly Jets.\n\nAdding Hall would be a great move for Kansas City, as the veteran rusher can add a much-needed explosive element to the Chiefs' offense, both as a runner and pass-catcher, thanks to his home-run ability.\n\nAs fun as it would be to see Hall, who drew interest from the Chiefs at the trade deadline last month, playing in Andy Reid's offense, we would consider that happening highly unlikely.\n\nNot only would the Chiefs have to give up draft capital to acquire Hall, assuming he gets the franchise tag, they would also have to pay him a lucrative, long-term deal that Spotrac projects will cost around $10.4 million annually.\n\nWe just don't see the Chiefs jumping through all those hoops. Now, if Hall hits free agency and Kansas City can sign him outright, that changes things.\n\nEtienne is the more realistic target, as he will hit the open market, barring the Jags extending him beforehand, which remains a possibility after what has been a bounce-back year for him.\n\nBut the Jaguars also invested a fourth-round pick in Bhayshul Tuten and the team is only projected to have $9.4 million in cap space, so they might opt to take the cheaper route at running back.\n\nSpotrac projects a much more reasonable contract for Etienne at $6.6 million per year over two years. That is much \n\nEtienne isn't as explosive as Hall, but he'd still provide a sizeable upgrade over Hunt and Pacheco, both as a rusher and pass-catcher.\n\nAs for Pierce, he'd be exactly what the doctor ordered for the Chiefs' passing attack, as he's one of the best big-play weapons in the NFL, as evidenced by his league-leading 20.2 yards per reception this season.\n\nPierce, who is in the midst of a career-best season and is only 25, has never posted elite production, but that will also help keep his price down a bit.\n\nSpotrac projects Pierce will land a four-year, $63.9 million contract, which amounts to $16 million annually. That would be a fair price for a receiver who would check a huge box for KC while providing a perfect complement to Rashee Rice.\n\nThe Colts are going to be keen on keeping Pierce, though, and unlike the Chiefs, Indy is going to have plenty of funds to keep him around.\n\nRavens named possible landing spot for Cowboys' pending free agent\n\nBroncos have six ways to clinch a playoff berth in Week 15\n\nPatriots AFC East, playoff-clinching scenarios for Week 15\n\nFun age-related Philip Rivers facts as QB comes out of retirement\n\nCowboys' updated outlook in NFC East after Eagles' loss\n\nPhilip Rivers' first child is older than this many Colts players",

    "fullText": "They could still qualify directly for the quarter-finals stage but it is out of their hands.\n\nArsenal women qualify for Champions League play-offs but injury problems mount 4\n\nAlthough the scoreline suggested a narrow 1-0 win, this was a dominant performance from Arsenal, particularly on the defensive side. The team worked relentlessly throughout the game to deny Twente both space and time. The statistics underline the control, two shots and only one on target for Twente, compared with 15 shots and five on target for Arsenal.\n\nIt was frustrating that the forwards did not have their shooting boots on, otherwise the performance would have bordered on outstanding. Chances were created consistently on the night, but the finishing was lacking.\n\nOff the ball, the team were superb, especially the midfield three of Caldentey, Pelova and Cooney-Cross, who are nominally all attacking midfielders. They worked tirelessly to maintain the defensive block shape and ensure the press was well organised, particularly the new tactical tweak of two players pressing the ball-holder simultaneously.\n\nWith the Meadow Park set-up change, the benches now sit directly beneath the press box, which meant Aaron D’Antino and Renee Slegers could be heard clearly throughout. Their instructions repeatedly focused on getting the two sixes into position to stop defensive transitions and keeping the unit as compact as possible.\n\nSlegers made only two changes from the Liverpool match. Fox was rested, McCabe came in at left-back with Hinds switching across to right-back, while Pelova replaced Maanum. Borbe continued in goal. With Codina and Nighswonger unavailable through injury, there were limited defensive options on the bench. Thankfully, Williamson was not required.\n\nThere was a worrying moment when Elberink, the Twente winger, arrived late into a challenge and kicked Borbe in the head. The forward was rightly booked, though there was an expectation in the ground that VAR might intervene for a potential red card.\n\nThe same type of incident occurred in the Real Madrid v Wolfsburg match the previous day. Referee Kirsty Dowle initially gave a yellow card, but unlike at Meadow Park, VAR intervened. The referee was sent to the monitor, the yellow card was rescinded and a red card was shown for serious foul play.\n\nWhile the PGMOL is often criticised, the all-English VAR crew under UEFA jurisdiction handled that incident correctly, which is a clear example of VAR working as it should.\n\nWith no red card at Meadow Park, the match grew increasingly physical after that incident. More fouls followed, further yellow cards were shown and the referee struggled to fully control a contest that remained on edge until the final whistle.\n\nBorbe took a significant blow and there will be concern over concussion, which would rule her out for a number of matches. At one stage, attention even turned to the possibility of a first-team debut for 17-year-old Amy Liddiard in goal. She remains untested at this level and that scenario alone is likely to push Arsenal towards securing an emergency loan as swiftly as possible.\n\nUnder Champions League regulations:\n\n“If a club cannot count on the services of at least two goalkeepers registered on List A because of long-term injury or illness, the club concerned may temporarily replace the goalkeeper concerned and register a new goalkeeper at any time during the season and complete the official registration of List A with a goalkeeper fit to be fielded. An injury or illness is considered long-term if it lasts at least 30 days as of the day the injury or illness occurred. If the goalkeeper recovers before the end of this 30-day period, the player must nonetheless remain off List A until the end of such period. The new goalkeeper does not have to be locally trained, even if the replaced goalkeeper was.”\n\nThe Women’s Super League regulations also allow emergency registration outside of the window where a club has fewer than two fully fit goalkeepers available for selection due to injury.\n\nWith three matches still to be played before Christmas, it would be sensible to expect Arsenal to accelerate the arrival of a goalkeeper to avoid the risk of fielding an untested 17-year-old should Borbe be unavailable through concussion.\n\nEverton away at Goodison Park is next on Saturday, another must-win fixture in the battle for second place in the league.",

    "fullText": "There's no hiding from the fact that Salah was Liverpool's best player last season.\n\nIn fact, he's arguably been their most important over the last few years with his goal contributions alone often making the difference.\n\nThis season, things haven't gone to plan and even though Arne Slot tried to stick with the Egyptian King, his form resulted in him being benched.\n\nAnd, since he's now started on the bench for Liverpool in their last three games and has been omitted from their Champions League squad to face Inter Milan, rumours about Salah's future have begun to emerge.\n\nHis sale would undoubtedly shake things up at Anfield and be rather surprising but, on the face of things, moving the 33-year-old on may not be the worst idea.\n\nIf Salah was contributing to goals as often as he was last season, talk of him leaving Liverpool wouldn't even be emerging.\n\nHowever, since he's not been his usual self, fans have begun to question whether the Egyptian King still has what it takes to be the Reds' main attacker.\n\nIndeed, the Anfield outfit have already started to prepare for his exit by signing Alexander Isak and Hugo Ekitike but since they both thrive when used as number nines, one is often left on the bench to accommodate Salah.\n\nThese moves would be valid if the former Chelsea ace was playing to his usual standards but with the number of players that Liverpool have who can play at striker, it feels like moving Salah on wouldn't be the end of the world.\n\nIt would also allow all four of Liverpool's best midfielders to start the game and perhaps help shore up the Reds' defensive ranks.\n\nUsing two strikers rather than wingers could also help Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez thrive, especially with their attacking prowess.\n\nThis flexibility could help save their season and perhaps allow them to get back into the Premier League title race or even win the Champions League.",

    "description": "We’re back in the top 10 baybeee",
    "fullText": "As Week 15 approaches, we rounded up the latest NFL power rankings to get a sense of how the Jaguars are viewed nationally.\n\nTrevor Lawrence has taken major strides the past two weeks. It’s all starting to click in the new offense.\n\nThey played once at Levi’s Stadium this year. Could they be returning?\n\nMost shocking statistical ranking: Wide receiver Brian Thomas Jr . is 50th in receiving yards\n\nExpectations were pretty high for Thomas after a big rookie season — 1,282 yards (third in the NFL) and 10 TDs — but he has had issues catching the ball (five drops) and rookie Travis Hunter moved ahead of Thomas into the No. 1 receiver role by Week 7 before Hunter ‘s season-ending injury. Thomas did miss three games because of an ankle injury and has had five catches for 115 yards in the two games since his return. But the team now views Jakobi Meyers — whom they traded for on Nov. 4 — as its No. 1 wideout. Thomas has 535 receiving yards so far.\n\nThey’re holding steady at No. 9 − and now firmly atop the AFC South with fifth-year QB Trevor Lawrence playing his most efficient football of the season heading into the stretch drive.\n\nNothing about Jacksonville’s successful season has felt intentional, let alone sustainable, but I think that the Jaguars are turning the corner. Quarterback Trevor Lawrence has finally found a good rhythm in the passing game, his receivers are catching the ball again, and the playoff picture is shaping up for the Jags to win a game or two this postseason.\n\nAfter saying all that, I’m positive that this team will repay my belief by embarrassing itself in the next couple of weeks.\n\nBeating the Colts was huge and probably wrapped up the AFC South for them. Still, it’s hard not to wonder how the game would’ve played out if Indy hadn’t lost QB Daniel Jones.\n\nIf you were to ask me to identify Jacksonville’s superpower, I’d probably stumble my way through an answer before mentioning the run defense. But once Daniel Jones was knocked out of Sunday’s game, the Jaguars flexed their muscles and put the Colts away to wrest temporary control of the division. The Texans are coming, but these Jaguars are making things work in Liam Coen’s first season. He might be running third in the Coach of the Year race behind Mike Vrabel and Ben Johnson, but Coen’s offense looked nice early against Indy before slowing down after halftime. All in all, though, this team is playing good football at the right time. Jacksonville has allowed just 13 points per game over the past four, and it’s looking like the Jags could face undrafted rookie Brady Cook at QB when the Jets come to town this Sunday.\n\nThe Jaguars took control of the NFC South on Sunday, and there’s a good chance they secure their first division title since 2022 by winning three of their final four games.\n\nWith Daniel Jones injured for Indianapolis, the Denver Broncos are probably the only playoff-caliber challenge left on Jacksonville’s schedule. If the Jags don’t play down to the competition against the Colts, Jets and Titans, they’ll host a playoff game.\n\nHow Jacksonville actually fares in the postseason will hinge on Trevor Lawrence’s play and the defense’s ability to force turnovers. The Jaguars haven’t won the turnover battle and lost a game since Week 2.\n\nAs wrong as I was about how Ben Johnson’s demeanor was going to translate to leading an NFL locker room, I may have been equally wrong about Liam Coen. Just look at the immaculate vibes taking place here.\n\nSunday changed everything in the AFC South. The Colts lost Daniel Jones, and the Jaguars picked up a critical win. It’s hard to watch the Jaguars and Texans and believe Jacksonville is the better team right now (more on the Texans in a bit) but they do lead the division. The AFC South might come down to whether the Jaguars can beat the Broncos or the Texans can beat the Chargers, because the other remaining games for both teams are all winnable.\n\nFrom Josh Kendall and Chad Graff:\n\nThe Jaguars’ first-year coach is in a neck-and-neck race with the Bears’ Ben Johnson for the most performative postgame locker room speeches. After Jacksonville won for the fifth time in six games Sunday, Coen looked on the verge of breaking his players’ hands high-fiving. He has the players believing, though. Josh Hines-Allen was even talking about the Super Bowl after recording his seventh sack.\n\nThe Jaguars’ average rank this week is 9.6 (last week: 11.2).\n\nThe #Jaguars keep on climbing pic.twitter.com/mJqYwcOuw0\n\n— Duval 22 (@duval22dotcom) December 10, 2025\n\nWhere would you rank the team, Jaguars fans? Let us know in the comments!",

    "fullText": "LSU football is set to face Houston in the Texas Bowl on Dec. 27. While it was a disappointing year for LSU, Houston is a team looking for win No. 10. That would be a massive accomplishment in Willie Fritz's second year leading the program.\n\nIn fact, Houston is ranked, sitting No. 24 in the latest US LBM Coaches Poll.\n\nAfter going 4-8 in 2024, Houston got off to a 4-0 start in 2025. The September schedule didn't include many challenges, but Houston made the most of it and took care of business. Texas Tech delivered Houston's first loss of the season, an understandable one given that Texas Tech is a College Football Playoff team ranked in the top four.\n\nAfter the Texas Tech loss, Houston got back on track with three straight wins, including victories over decent Arizona and Arizona State teams.\n\nHouston was upset by West Virginia, but added two more wins in November, beating UCF and Baylor.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LSU Wire: Where LSU football's bowl opponent ranks in US LBM Coaches Poll?",

    "description": "On sharing more of yourself.",
    "fullText": "Probably not a popular thing to say today. The zeitgeisty thing to say\nis that we should all log off and live terrible cottagecore solarpunk\nlives raising chickens and being mindful. I wish people were more\nonline and more public. I have rarely wished the opposite. Consider\nthis post addressed to you, the reader.\n\nI will often find a blog post on Hacker News that really\nresonates. And when I go to check the rest of the site there’s three\nother posts. And I think: I wish you’d write more! When I find someone\nwhose writing I really connect with, I like to read everything they\nhave written, or at least a tractable subset of their most interesting\nposts. If I like what I see, I reach out. This is one of the best\nthings about writing online: your future friends will seek you out.\n\nAnd, from the other side, I have often written a post where, just\nbefore publishing, I would think: “who would want to read this? It’s\ntoo personal, obscure, idiosyncratic, probably a few people will\nun And always those are the posts\nwhere people email me to say they always thought the same thing but\ncould never quite put it into words. I really value those emails. “I\nam understood” is a wonderful feeling.\n\nI try to apply a rule that if I do something, and don’t write about\nit—or otherwise generate external-facing evidence of it—it didn’t\nhappen. I have built so many things in the dark, little experiments or\nsoftware projects or essays that never saw the light of day. I want to\nput more things out. If it doesn’t merit an entire blog post, then at\nleast a tweet.\n\nIf I follow you on Twitter, and you have posted a picture of your\nbookshelf, I have probably scanned every book in it. This is why I\nappreciate Goodreads. Like many people I have been reading a lot\nless over the past ~5y, but since I made a Goodreads account earlier\nthis year, I’ve read tens of books. Reading in public has helped to\nmotivate me.\n\nYou may say reading in public is performative. I say reading in\nprivate is solipsistic. Dante, in De Monarchia, writes:\n\nAll men on whom the Higher Nature has stamped the love of truth\nshould especially concern themselves in laboring for posterity, in\norder that future generations may be enriched by their efforts, as\nthey themselves were made rich by the efforts of generations\npast. For that man who is imbued with public teachings, but cares\nnot to contribute something to the public good, is far in arrears of\nhis duty, let him be assured; he is, indeed, not “a tree planted by\nthe rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season,”\n[Psalms 1:3] but rather a destructive whirlpool, always\nengulfing, and never giving back what it has devoured.\n\nMy default mode is solipsism. I read in private, build in private,\nlearn in private. And the problem with that is self-doubt and\narbitrariness. I’m halfway through a textbook and think: why? Why am I\nlearning geology? Why this topic, and not another? There is never an\na priori reason. I take notes, but why tweak the LaTeX if no-one,\nprobably not even future me, will read them? If I stop reading this\nbook, what changes? And doing things in public makes them both more\nreal and (potentially) useful. If you publish your study notes, they\nmight be useful to someone. Maybe they get slurped up in the training\nset of the next LLM, marginally improving performance.\n\nAnd Goodreads, for all its annoyances, is a uniquely tender social\nnetwork. Finishing a book, and then seeing a friend mark it as “want\nto read”, feels like a moment of closeness.\n\nI have a friend who lived in Sydney, who has since moved away, and we\ndon’t keep in touch too often, because the timezones are inconvenient,\nbut occasionally she likes my book updates, and I like hers, and I\nwill probably never read that avant-garde novel, but I’m glad she is\nreading it. It is like saying: “You exist. I exist. I remember. I wish\nyou happiness.”\n\nLots of people use spaced repetition, but most everyone’s\nflashcard collections are private. They exist inside a database inside\nan app like Anki or Mochi. You can export decks, but\nthat’s not a living artifact but a dead snapshot, frozen in time.\n\nOne reason I built hashcards: by using a Git repo of Markdown\nfiles as the flashcard database, you can trivially publish your deck\nto GitHub. My own flashcard collection is public. I hope that\nmore people use hashcards and put their decks up on GitHub.\n\nThe point is not that you can clone their repos (which is close to\nuseless: you have to write your own flashcards) but because I’m\ncurious what people are learning. Not the broad strokes, since we all\nwant to learn thermo and econ and quantum chemistry and the military\nhistory of the Song dynasty and so on, but the minutiae. Why did you\nmake a flashcard out of this Bible passage? Why does it resonate with\nyou? Why do you care about the interpretation of that strange passage\nin Antigone? Why did you memorize this poem?\n\nComputers mediate every aspect of our lives, yet most people use their\ncomputers the way they came out of the box. At most they might change\nthe desktop background. Some people don’t even change the default\nicons on the macOS dock. Even most Linux users just use the stock\nconfiguration, e.g. GNOME on Fedora or whatever.\n\nI’m interested in people who customize their experience of\ncomputing. This is often derided as “ricing”. But agency is\ninteresting. People who remake their environment to suit them are\ninteresting. And I am endlessly curious about how people do this. I\nlike reading people’s init.el, their custom shell scripts, their\nNixOS config. It’s even better if they have some obscure hardware\ne.g. some keyboard layout I’ve never heard of and a trackball with\ncustom gestures. I put my dotfiles up on GitHub because I\nimagine someone will find them interesting.\n\nAnd beyond my selfish curiosity there’s also the Fedorovist\nancestor simulation angle: if you die and are not\ncryopreserved, how else are you going to make it to the other side of\nthe intelligence explosion? Every tweet, blog post, Git commit,\njournal entry, keystroke, mouse click, every one of these things is a\ntomographic cut of the mind that created it.",

    "description": "Pinterest predicts that mismatched beauty, nostalgia, and an obsession with cabbage will be 2026's biggest trends.",
    "fullText": "Pinterest did a pulse check on the internet's 2026 mood. It predicts glamorous, glittery fashion will return, layered scents will be popular, and people might just develop an obsession with cabbage.\n\nThe San Francisco-headquartered company released its annual \"Pinterest Predicts\" report on Tuesday. It said it analyzed \"billions of Pinterest searches and the visual content Pinterest users are engaging with,\" which helped it uncover emerging words, colors, styles, and aesthetics.\n\n\"With a boost from machine learning, our trend experts find patterns by combining data insights with real-world observations,\" the report said.\n\nThe company predicts that 21 trends will be hot globally in 2026.\n\nTake a look at the top five in the US:\n\nThe topic that Pinterest says will trend highest in the US in 2026 isn't a fashion or home decor trend — it's cabbage.\n\n\"In the year ahead, boomers and Gen X will say goodbye to their cauliflower obsession and crown cabbage the new kitchen champ,\" it wrote. \"Think blistered-edge 'steaks', kimchi cocktails and even crispier taco wraps.\"\n\nIt said the search terms cabbage dumplings had risen 110% from September 2024 to August 2025 compared to the same period the year before, while Golumpki soup and cabbage Alfredo saw similar spikes.\n\nThis falls right in line with one of 2025's top diet trends, \"fibermaxxing,\" which stresses the importance of consuming enough fiber for heart and gut health.\n\nSecond on the list is \"Glitchy Glam,\" which refers to imperfect beauty. The report said that in 2026, \"beauty is missing the mark — on purpose.\"\n\n\"Gen Z and millennials will rock mismatched manicures, two-toned lipstick, and bright eyeshadow in two binary hues. So long, symmetry,\" it wrote.\n\nThe search terms that led Pinterest to believe mismatched beauty would trend were \"eccentric makeup,\" \"weird makeup looks,\" \"avant-garde makeup editorial,\" and \"nails with different colors on each hand.\"\n\nThis marks a departure from the \"clean girl\" makeup trend that has reigned supreme on social media in recent years.\n\nPinterest says thrifting and parenting will remain top of mind in 2026.\n\nThe search terms \"1970s childhood toys,\" \"upcycled baby clothes,\" and \"vintage kids fashion\" had done well on Pinterest between September 2024 and August 2025, the report said.\n\n\"In 2026, childhood gets a throwback twist with vintage-inspired outfits, classic toys from the '60s and upcycled baby looks,\" it wrote. \"Crocheted play mats will bring cosy vibes to any nursery, while baby boomers and Gen X will thrift mini fits.\"\n\nGen Z and millennials won't be satisfied with store-bought perfumes in 2026, Pinterest said.\n\n\"Gen Z and millennials are ditching one-and-done scents for bespoke notes, blending oils and perfumes to craft their very own fragrance formulas,\" it wrote in the report. \"Expect luxury to linger in layers next year.\"\n\nPinterest said search terms pointing to this trend include \"perfume layering combinations,\" \"scent layering,\" and \"niche perfume collection.\"\n\nLastly, Pinterest predicts that an \"intergalactic\" aesthetic will trend highly in the US, particularly among Gen Z and millennials.\n\n\"Think holographic home accents, opalescent eyeshadow that looks like moon dust, and cosmic silhouettes straight out of a sci-fi movie,\" the report said.\n\nThe search term \"alien core aesthetic\" increased by 80% between September 2024 and August 2025 compared to the same period in the previous year. Other trending search terms include \"opalescent,\" \"futuristic truck,\" and \"soft dewy makeup.\"\n\nPinterest says 2026 is also set to be the year of \"Glamoratti,\" which spells a return to loud, decadent, and maximalist fashion. Think chunky gold jewelry, funnel neck outfits, and tailored suits.\n\nAnother trend worth noting is \"Pen Pals.\" This is a hobby-based trend that Pinterest says could lead to a resurgence of letter writing, as Gen Z and millennials grow tired of texting and social media.\n\nAnd lastly, Pinterest coined \"Gimme Gummy,\" an ASMR-loaded, gummy-bear aesthetic which is predicted to be hot in 2026. \"Gimme Gummy\" is characterized by \"bendy phone cases,\" \"3D jewelry,\" and \"rubberized nail art.\"\n\nPinterest reported third-quarter revenue of $1.049 billion in November, representing a 17% increase compared to the same period the previous year. Its monthly active users increased by 12% compared to the previous year, reaching 600 million.\n\nThe company's stock is down about 6% since the start of the past year.",

    "title": "Women at the top are exhausted and burned out, according to a McKinsey and Lean In report",
    "description": "Burnout among senior-level women is the highest it has been in the past five years, according to a report from McKinsey and LeanIn.org.",
    "fullText": "Women are hitting the top of the corporate ladder only to find something waiting for them: exhaustion.\n\nAccording to a report published Tuesday by McKinsey and LeanIn.org, a nonprofit founded by Sheryl Sandberg, burnout among senior-level women is the highest it has been in the past five years.\n\nAround 60% of these women said they have frequently felt burned out at work in the past few months, compared with 50% of senior-level men, per numbers from the \"Women in the Workplace\" 2025 study.\n\nWomen who are newer to leadership roles are feeling the strain more acutely. Among senior-level women who have been at their companies for five years or less, 70% reported frequent burnout, and 81% said they are concerned about their job security.\n\n\"These high levels of concern align with research that shows women often face extra scrutiny when they're new to organizations and have to work harder to prove themselves,\" the report said, adding that Black women in leadership face exceptionally high burnout and job insecurity. \"In contrast, when women and men in leadership have longer tenures, their levels of burnout and job security are quite similar.\"\n\nThe report, an annual study of women in corporate America, surveyed 9,500 employees across 124 companies between July and August. The study also includes interviews with 62 HR executives and company-reported data from 124 organizations that together employ about 3 million people.\n\nLeanIn.org launched a study with McKinsey in 2015 to track how women progress through the corporate pipeline and where companies fall short. The group is named after Sandberg's 2013 book \"Lean In,\" which sparked a national debate about women's ambition, leadership, and workplace equality.\n\nThis year's findings paint a bleak picture for women at the top. Senior-level women who are hesitant to advance their careers say they see a steeper path forward compared to their male counterparts. Eleven percent of senior women who don't want to advance say they don't see a realistic route to promotion, compared with 3% of senior men. And 21% say more senior-level people look burned out or unhappy, nearly double the share of men who say the same.\n\nIt's not because women are less committed — the report found that women and men are equally locked in. What differs is the desire to keep climbing, per the report.\n\nThe data shows a clear ambition gap: 80% of women want to be promoted to the next level, compared with 86% of men. That gap is widest at the beginning and the top of the pipeline — 69% vs. 80% at the entry level, and 84% vs. 92% among senior leaders.\n\nThis is the first time in the report's 11-year history that women have shown lower interest in promotion than men, it said.\n\nThis gap in ambition to advance falls away \"when women receive the same career support that men do,\" the report added. In other words, companies are responsible for creating the burnout problem for women.\n\n\"This is only happening in the companies that aren't doing the right thing when women get the full support and the same stretch opportunities. They're not leaning out at all,\" Sandberg said in a Tuesday interview with Bloomberg Television.\n\n\"What's happening is that women face more barriers at every level of the career,\" she added.\n\nEven as companies say they are committed to diversity and inclusion, at least one in six have reduced the teams or resources behind those efforts, the report said.\n\nAbout 13% of employers have pulled back or eliminated women-focused career-development programs, and another 13% have cut formal sponsorship programs, which play a key role in helping employees advance, it added.\n\n\"Women overall are less likely to have sponsors — and this really matters. Employees with sponsors are promoted at nearly twice the rate of those without,\" the report said.\n\nThe report also found that companies are rolling back remote and flexible work options, which can hinder women's ability to stay and advance in their careers. One in four has scaled back remote or hybrid work arrangements, and 13% have reduced flexible working hours over the past year.\n\nAt the same time, the report said that women who work remotely most of the time are \"less likely to have a sponsor and far less likely to have been promoted in the last two years than women who work mostly on-site.\" Meanwhile, men receive more similar levels of sponsorship and promotions regardless of their work arrangement.\n\nAt the entry level, a stage where advocacy and visibility are essential, women are also less likely than men to receive stretch assignments and other opportunities, the report added.\n\nLast year, the \"Women in the Workplace\" study found that more women were advancing to senior leadership roles. By 2024, women held 29% of C-suite roles, up from 17% in 2015.\n\nHowever, progress fades at the entry and management levels, per the report. \"For every 100 men promoted to manager in 2018, 79 women were promoted. And this year, just 81 women were,\" it added.",

    "title": "Pay cuts, poaching, and pivoting: Inside Scale AI after Meta",
    "description": "Five months after Meta's $14 billion deal, Scale AI has lost some of its gleam, with workers sniping about pay, and rivals coming for its clientele.",
    "fullText": "This summer, after Meta made a $14 billion investment in Scale AI and poached its 28-year-old founder, Alexandr Wang, and after A-list clients like OpenAI and Google halted work with the startup, a worker for Scale AI anxiously asked ChatGPT what it thought of his company's fate. He knew the chatbot well, having tested it for vulnerabilities. Its prognosis was grim.\n\n\"Scale AI will no longer exist as a credible independent entity within 24 months,\" ChatGPT, which isn't any kind of official authority, wrote. \"Its infrastructure will be repurposed for Meta's internal needs. Its client base will evaporate. Its role as a neutral red teamer or external evaluator is effectively over.\"\n\nThe contractor shared the chat logs with fellow workers at Scale AI. In one reply reviewed by Business Insider, one worker said that they were already on their way out, describing the startup as a ticking time bomb.\n\nThe chatbot was drawing from a storm of headlines about Scale AI, which until this summer had been touted as one of the most ascendant startups in tech — the place Big Tech companies vying for AI supremacy went to when they wanted their chatbots stress-tested and perfected. Lately, it's lost some of its gleam, with investors significantly lowering valuations, workers sniping about pay, and rivals coming for its clientele.\n\nThe vast army of human data labelers that made Scale AI a juggernaut are chafing at what they say are pay cuts, lengthy unpaid onboarding sessions to join new AI projects, and thinning workloads — and are increasingly leaving the platform altogether, according to interviews with five current and former contractors and internal correspondence obtained by Business Insider.\n\nActivity in the main internal chatroom for Outlier — Scale AI's flagship gig work platform, which touts more than 100,000 taskers — has plummeted since the Meta investment, with weekly discussion threads drawing dozens instead of the usual hundreds of replies, according to screenshots reviewed by Business Insider.\n\nOne tasker said that they'd spent close to 40 hours in a single month in unpaid onboarding sessions without landing any actual work, noting that other platforms like Scale AI's rival Mercor do pay for this kind of work. Elizabeth Boyd, another tasker, says she rarely does work for Outlier anymore after seeing effective pay rates for some projects slashed to around $20 an hour — down from the $50 she used to make. One gig that advertised $20 an hour only allowed three minutes of working time every two days, or a 99-cent payout, according to screenshots obtained by Business Insider.\n\nJoe Osborne, a Scale AI spokesperson, says the balance sheets show the company is on the right path. \"This quarter is on track to be our biggest of 2025, our data business is more profitable today than it was before the Meta deal, and our applications business, which includes work with Fortune 500 companies and governments, has doubled revenue\" in the second half of the year compared to the first, Osborne wrote in an email. He also noted there has been an increase in active users on Outlier since the Meta deal, and that pay rates are based on the skills for each project and contributors always see the rates upfront, and have the option of declining any gig.\n\nThe company is also looking to diversify. The startup has embraced fields like robotics, announcing a new lab to meet booming demand for robot training data this fall. It's doubling down on its US military and other government work, winning up to $199 million worth of defense contracts since the Meta deal.\n\nSome investors are bullish. In one current investor's view, Meta has mostly left Scale alone, letting it operate as an independent company. With around $1 billion on the balance sheet, the investor added, there are no plans to fundraise. And an IPO could still be on the table at some point.\n\nOther investors see Scale AI as more like a gutted fish. The Meta investment — which valued Scale AI at $29 billion — has dented Scale AI's valuation in private markets where people buy and sell equity from pre-IPO startups. Noel Moldvai, Augment's CEO, tells Business Insider his platform used to process millions of dollars' worth of transactions in Scale AI stock before the Meta deal, but that dried up as sellers waited to see if the startup rebounded. Activity is picking up again, he said, but at lower valuations of around $15 billion to $9 billion. The underlying message of Meta's semi-acquisition is clear to Moldvai. \"It seems like Meta was just after Alexandr Wang, and so this is probably the structure that let them get him,\" he says. He adds that Scale AI's valuation could still bounce back.\n\nOn another marketplace, Caplight, Scale's valuation has dropped to $7.3 billion. Osborne says that the valuation is not accurate because there have been no sales of stock at that price and multiples of comparable companies would yield a higher valuation.\n\nIf the company doesn't pull it off, it could become the latest example of a once-promising startup that morphed into a \"zombie\" after being invested in by a tech giant.\n\nThis summer, Scale AI painted a rosy picture of the Meta investment, describing it as a major cash infusion and source of future work in its official statement at the time of the deal. That messaging was also conveyed to the startup's corporate workforce, says another former member of Scale AI's red team, which tests chatbots for flaws and vulnerabilities. Just a few weeks after the investment, he was laid off as part of a major downsizing that saw 14% of Scale AI's full-time staff of 1,400 let go.\n\nOsborne said the layoffs were aimed at making the data division profitable, which it now is.\n\nThose weren't the only cuts. In September, Scale AI terminated 12 contractors on its red team, citing performance issues. Two ex-red teamers told Business Insider that the team's work had been drying up since the Meta deal, blaming thinning workloads for the cuts. Later that month, Scale AI shuttered a team in Dallas of contractors focused on generalist AI work as it moved towards more specialized fields.\n\nOsborne said the 12 contractors were part of Scale's temporary workforce and represented a small fraction of its overall red team, which the company is still committed to investing in. He said the Dallas cuts were part of an industry shift towards higher skilled work and represent a small fraction of its overall workforce.\n\nMeanwhile, a swarm of AI training startups has rushed in to poach Scale AI's workers and clients. Some are now raising capital at soaring valuations. Surge AI hit a valuation of $24 billion while Mercor, which is run by three 22-year-olds, announced in October it had raised $350 million at a $10 billion valuation.\n\nMercor has won at least one major AI training project from Meta, Scale AI's 49% shareholder. In September, Scale AI filed a lawsuit in California against Mercor alleging it hired one of its sales employees to poach its biggest customers, allegations Mercor denies.\n\nOne Scale AI investor said he'd been frustrated with Scale AI's leadership losing customers to Surge AI in particular, which reportedly brought in more revenue than Scale in 2024, despite never having raised outside funding. (Scale AI had raised more than $1.5 billion before the Meta deal.)\n\nBrendan Foody, Mercor's CEO, has publicly criticized Scale AI for what he claims are low pay rates and data quality issues. \"Scale lost the focus on product, on scaling quality,\" Foody said in a September podcast appearance. In response, a Scale AI spokesperson told Business Insider its quality metrics are at \"record highs.\"\n\nIt's not just rival CEOs making that point. Tammy Hartline, who managed projects for Scale AI as a consultant until the summer of 2025, said Scale grew so quickly that the work became more about needing bodies than skills. \"Spam and low quality data became accepted as a cost of doing business,\" she said. Hartline joined Mercor in September.\n\nScale AI has also been beset with security issues that predate Meta's investment. In June, Business Insider reported that Scale AI routinely used public Google Docs to track work for high-profile customers, including Google, Meta, and xAI. That practice left AI training documents labeled \"confidential\" accessible to anyone with the link and exposed reams of personal information, like private emails and pay details, about contractors. \"We take data security seriously,\" Osborne said. \"We conducted a thorough investigation and disabled any user's ability to publicly share documents from Scale managed systems.\"\n\nSloppy security isn't uncommon in the AI training space — Surge AI similarly left open sensitive work for its client Anthropic. But the exposed documents seen by Business Insider show that for a project for Google, Scale AI faced security and quality issues throughout 2023 and 2024. Thousands of taskers were flagged for being \"suspected spammers,\" \"cheaters,\" with hundreds of workers listed in spreadsheets with titles like \"Good and Bad Folks\" and \"suspicious non-US taskers.\" Meta recently removed more than 40 groups buying and reselling AI training accounts, including from Scale AI, in response to a recent Business Insider investigation. Osborne said Scale's data quality metrics are the highest they've ever been.\n\nThe company has notched some recent wins. It once appeared bogged down by litigation, but recently agreed to settle multiple lawsuits filed by ex-workers in California who alleged they were underpaid and misclassified as contractors. (Scale no longer accepts gig workers from the state.) The big question remains whether Scale AI can thrive in the increasingly competitive AI training industry it helped give birth to. For many former workers, it'll be too late to find out.\n\nCharles Rollet is Business Insider's tech correspondent in San Francisco.

    "description": "EQT has grown to become one of the largest private-equity investors, but its not a household name in the US. Peter Aliprantis is working to change that.",
    "fullText": "EQT is one of the largest private equity investors in the world — yet most wealthy Americans have barely heard of it. That's the uphill battle facing Peter Aliprantis, the Swedish firm's head of private wealth in the Americas, as EQT tries to pitch in a market dominated by Wall Street brands with plenty of CNBC airtime.\n\n\"Most people in the United States are not familiar with us, and the way we say it, we're the best-kept secret,\" Aliprantis told Business Insider.\n\nPrivate Equity International ranked the firm as the second-largest private equity firm, with $312 billion of assets under management. It raised more than $113 billion in third-party private equity capital from 2020 to the end of 2024, putting it ahead of Blackstone, and just behind KKR so far this decade.\n\nLike many of its competitors, it's turning to private wealth as the newest source of growth. The industry's change of fundraising focus comes as private equity firms are slow to return cash to investors, and over-allocation among institutional investors means that institutional funding is slowing.\n\nBut the same reasons that the firm isn't as well-known in America are actually an advantage, Aliprantis said.\n\nIn a world where debt-heavy buyouts are proving more difficult and an increasingly concentrated American private market is pushing some to invest internationally, a global industrialist approach can be attractive.\n\nEQT has returned capital at a normal pace, with $23 billion in distributions for the year ending June 2025. The firm has also been building a private wealth business for the past four years, which accounts for 10% of its current assets. The firm has a goal to reach between 15-20% during its current $100 billion fundraising cycle, according to its second-quarter report.\n\nAliprantis walked Business Insider through the firm's pitch to financial advisors and private wealth distribution networks, explaining why its global reach is a significant advantage in 2025.\n\nThe key for EQT, Aliprantis said, is for the firm to offer individual investors the \"exact same deals\" it gives institutional investors.\n\nEQT was founded in 1994 as a spin-off from industrial holding company Investor AB, but the firm's history stretches back to Sweden's Wallenberg family. The Wallenbergs, called the \"Rockefellers of Europe,\" have created an empire of business holdings including massive stakes in Sweden's biggest firms, like ABB, AstraZeneca, or Saab.\n\n\"The Wallenberg family has a 160-year heritage of owning and developing companies,\" Aliprantis said. \"We're not financial engineers. We don't add a lot of leverage to what we do, and we're very, very different from what a lot of our peers on Wall Street are doing.\"\n\nAliprantis's comments echo a larger change in the industry, which is running out of easy money-making deals and cheap financing and now has to extract returns by actually building stronger companies.\n\nBut the firm's biggest advantage, Aliprantis said, is its global nature.\n\nOnly 35% of its assets are based in North America, and the firm has 26 global offices where its deal teams invest in local private equity, infrastructure, and real estate deals.\n\n\"A lot of our colleagues based in New York will fly deal team partners over to different places around the world to do the deal and then get on a plan and fly home,\" Aliprantis said. \"Our deal teams are pretty much based in the locations where they do deals.\"\n\nThis means the firm \"gets the call\" when local companies are looking to sell, and keeps them from larger \"bake-offs\" where the price might be bid-up.\n\nThis has also meant the firm can continue to provide distributions to its clients even if the market is slow in one locale.\n\n\"If you're a US-based domicile private markets firm that has 70 to 80% of your assets in the US, guess what? If the US IPO market is slowing, you're going to have a problem exiting,\" Aliprantis said.\n\n\"Here in the US, it's always been too much money chasing too few deals. You know what? That's a US thing,\" Aliprantis said.\" If you go to Europe and you go to Asia, it's the opposite.\"\n\nFor example, Bain estimates there's about $480 billion in dry powder for European private funds, including venture capital, compared to Pitchbook's $914.5 billion for US-focused private equity firms, not including VC. Apollo's Marc Rowan also recently told the Wall Street Journal that as an industry, they find themselves short ideas rather than capital.\n\nAliprantis said investors' biggest reason to diversify away from the US market is its concentrated bet on AI.\n\n\"Their concern is that the Mag Seven is roughly 37% of the S&P right now, and valuations are stretched,\" Aliprantis said. \"Is AI really going to work? Is it not? How additive is it going to be to the bottom line? We don't know.\"\n\nAcross the spectrum, Aliprantis said, the \"biggest concern\" is that retail investors are getting a set of less attractive deals, while institutional investors are getting a \"separate set of deals.\"\n\nAliprantis said that the firm's six evergreen vehicles are composed of the \"exact same deals\" that its institutional clients invest in.\n\nThe key to doing that, and to being a responsible investor or retail capital, is \"size and scale,\" Aliprantis said.\n\nSize also helps with the balance sheet necessary to launch a private wealth business. It can cost millions of dollars to hire the necessary staff to start selling to financial advisors and other wealth management channels before any revenue is returned to investors.\n\nEQT was able to use its balance sheet, as a public company in Sweden, to build its private wealth team and now has 70 private wealth professionals globally, with 20 based in the US.\n\nThat's not to say that smaller funds won't succeed, but it will be much harder, Aliprantis said. With so many investors competing for retail capital, consolidation is inevitable.\n\n\"The race is on in the industry right now,\" Aliprantis said.",

The song wasn't performed by a human artist — Breaking Rust, despite having the face of a handsome, rugged man in a cowboy hat on its Spotify profile, is an AI project.

The person behind Breaking Rust did not respond to a message I sent asking about the origin of the sound.\n\nIt's the latest example of ways that AI-generated music, with its opaque origins, can create confusion around who really made a song just as easily as it can create a hit. AI-generated music that sounds a lot like your faves but was made with a few prompts has been going viral, spreading far and wide and more quickly than music labels can always have it removed.\n\nWhen some of the first AI-generated tracks started racking up listens two years ago, music labels went to battle, threatening and filing legal action to stop AI generators from training on and using their artists' voices and music stylings. Universal Music Group (UMG) pushed to have a YouTube video where Eminem's voice rapped about cats taken down. Spotify removed AI slop songs that were listened to by bots to reap the streaming earning pool, and UMG also got streaming platforms to remove a viral \"Drake\" song that wasn't by Drake and The Weeknd at all, but a song written by Ghostwriter, an anonymous artist that uses AI to produce music and appears publicly only when cloaked in white and dark glasses.\n\nNow, the labels are starting to drop their fists and shake hands with AI music generators.\n\nWarner Music Group announced last month it had settled a lawsuit against AI music generator Suno (a test of the service by plaintiffs in the suit found that Suno would churn out works similar to ABBA and Chuck Berry when prompted in their style) and entered into a partnership with the company. Robert Kyncl, CEO of WMG, called it \"a victory for the creative community that benefits everyone.\" The announcement came just weeks after UMG, the world's largest record label, settled its copyright infringement lawsuit with AI music generator Udio, and said the two have partnered to create a new subscription service, slated to launch next year, run on gen AI and licensed music from the label's artists.\n\nAI companies face a litany of lawsuits after using copyrighted material to train their models. The battle is playing out in Hollywood, the news industry, and in visual arts — the music industry is the latest to decide it might be better to play nice with AI than continue a prickly, drawn out court battle when their rights sit in a gray area. \"AI is here to stay, it's transformative,\" Chris Wares, assistant chair of the Music Business Department at Berklee College of Music. The record labels, he says, are \"futureproofing themselves.\"\n\nThe proliferation of AI-generated voices and music stylings has sent a flood of new songs — some good, many uncatchy slop — onto streaming platforms and social media. There are more than 100 million songs on Spotify, Apple Music, and Bandcamp, and many are rarely or never played. Deezer, a French streaming platform, said in April that people were uploading some 20,000 fully AI-generated tracks each day, comprising nearly a fifth of all new content. As more playlists and artists making gen AI music are uploaded, human artists must fight for your ears. In July, a group called The Velvet Sundown rapidly racked up 1 million listens on two albums, something that many indie bands struggle to do on streaming platforms — but the photos of the band on social media are AI generated, and the real person or people behind the project remain unknown. In November, Billboard identified at least six AI or AI-assisted songs that had climbed onto its various charts. Amid the deluge, Spotify updated its impersonation policy in September, saying it would remove songs that featured the unauthorized use of someone's voice.\n\nIf someone makes a banger AI cover song or viral mashup, like reuniting Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham for a new Fleetwood Mac album or squashing the beef between Kendrick and Drake in a generated collaboration, the novelty factor could drive listening numbers that cut into original work from those artists. But the aim of these partnerships is to create new revenue streams for artists. The Warner deal stipulates that Suno will allow only paid accounts to download generated audio, and says artists must opt-in to having their names, voices, compositions, and likeness regenerated. In an industry where streaming has dramatically reduced royalties, that could be a boost — if fans make music of their faves, it could lead to passive income for the musicians. But that also means the artists' original works will be competing for ears against derivatives of themselves not just for your ears, but for streaming dollars.\n\n\"The reason why no generative AI music can be artist-first is because we are in a finite attention economy. Every minute that is spent listening to a generative AI track is a minute less spent listening to an artist track,\" Mark Mulligan, founder and senior music analyst at research firm MIDiA says. \"We are definitely in a world now where more and more consumers are creating, and that is competing with entertainment time.\"\n\nPart of that creative process may draw us back to older roots in how people interact with music. For hundreds, if not thousands, of years, music was communal. People played it together and used it to pass down stories. With recording technology and radios, music became widely distributed, which \"created this moat between artist and fan,\" Mulligan says. \"We got to this idea that music is a creative full stop, and that the audience doesn't help shape what the music is apart from when you go and see the band play live.\" But now, AI tools are becoming the ultimate form of fan expression. \"We're widening the funnel of creativity,\" says Mulligan.\n\nThat's if artists authorize their voices to be used by the platforms. Some forward-thinking musicians, like Grimes, have already made clones of their voices and invited listeners to experiment. It's less clear if your typical popstar will OK the use of their voice to sing words they haven't seen, and if the potential new revenue streams of such an experiment would prove worth the risk. On Friday, Brown released a \"trailertrap\" remix of \"Walk My Walk,\" a sort of taking back of his own style after seeing it emulated. So far, it has just 2,000 streams. \"If someone is going to sing like me, it should be me,\" Brown told the Associated Press last month. Going forward, it will likely take more than one listen to know if the music we hear is performed by the artists we've come to love.\n\nAmanda Hoover is a senior correspondent at Business Insider covering the tech industry.

    "description": "Chris Lattner helped build the software behind Google TPUs. Now he's coming after Nvidia.",
    "fullText": "In Silicon Valley, where bold technical bets abound, few bets look bolder than trying to break the grip of Nvidia's CUDA, a software stack that's quietly become the operating system of the AI boom.\n\nThat's what Modular, a startup founded by software gurus from Apple and Google, is trying to do.\n\nCofounders Chris Lattner and Tim Davis have spent decades building the software plumbing that sits beneath the modern tech industry. Lattner is famous for creating Apple's Swift programming language. He also built the software underpinning Google's TPU AI chips, with Modular cofounder Tim Davis.\n\nThey're now aiming that expertise at CUDA itself. The attempt borders on madness, but it's the kind of audacious project that could transform the AI industry.\n\n\"It's seen by a lot of people as somewhat crazy,\" said Kylan Gibbs, CEO of startup Inworld AI and a former product manager at Google DeepMind. \"That's where Chris has the advantage: He's smart enough to actually know how to do it, and somewhat crazy enough to set out to do it.\"\n\nCUDA began life almost 20 years ago as a way to make graphics chips programmable. Today, it has grown into a multilayered software ecosystem — language, libraries, compilers, inference systems — that most AI companies rely on.\n\nThat success comes at a cost: Most of the industry is now optimized around a single vendor's hardware. CUDA binds AI workloads to Nvidia GPUs. That is great for Nvidia, but deeply limiting for everyone else.\n\nOn the surface, there seems to be a ton of competition: AMD sells GPUs. Google has TPUs. Amazon created Trainium AI chips, and a host of startups are building similar hardware.\n\nThe problem is that each chip comes with its own software stack optimized just for that component. That means an endless reinvention of the wheel. Most of the time, it's simpler to just stick with CUDA — and Nvidia's GPUs.\n\nAnd yet, AI developers crave portability: Being able to use any combination of GPUs from multiple providers without juggling different software stacks.\n\n\"Nobody is building portable stuff, because why would anyone work on software for more than one chip when the chip projects themselves are doing the software?\" Lattner, Modular's CEO, told me in an interview.\n\nNvidia could extend CUDA to run well on rival AI chips. But doing so would undermine Nvidia's greatest moat: the closed-loop bond between its software and its chips. \"Obviously, they don't want portability,\" he said.\n\nFor Lattner, this paradox presents a big opportunity.\n\n\"We realized there's nobody in the industry that's actually incentivized to do this. It's very expensive, very hard,\" he said. \"And at the same time, everybody wants it.\"\n\nThat's what inspired Lattner and Davis to leave Google and start Modular in 2022, the year ChatGPT took the world by storm.\n\nSince then, Modular has raised $380 million from investors including Greylock, General Catalyst, and GV, Google's venture capital arm. The latest financing in September valued the startup at $1.6 billion. Modular isn't the only effort to break the CUDA lock-in. There has been ZLUDA, an open-source project that was funded by AMD, and more recently, the startup Spectral Compute, which has raised $6 million.\n\nLattner has used some of this money to hire talented programmers from Google, Apple, and other tech companies. They spent three years working in relative obscurity to create the building blocks of a new AI software stack.\n\nThe foundation starts with a brand-new programming language, called Mojo, that offers deep controls for making AI chips run as efficiently as possible.\n\nModular designed this to work similarly to Python, a popular and easy-to-use programming language. But Mojo also has the speed and power of other, more complex languages, such as C++, that are essential for AI development. Mojo also works well with PyTorch, an open-source framework that is often used when building AI models and applications.\n\nI first heard about Modular earlier this year when interviewing Carles Gelada, a former OpenAI researcher. \"There are several interesting projects to create GPU-agnostic frameworks and platforms, and challenge CUDA,\" he said at the time. \"Mojo is the most interesting one.\"\n\nMAX is the next major layer of Modular's new software stack. It powers AI inference, which is how models are run. This part of the system works with Nvidia GPUs, AMD GPUs, and similar chips from Apple. Modular hopes to add more AI chips in the future.\n\nOn top of that is another layer called Mammoth, which helps AI developers manage GPU clusters.\n\nIn late September, Modular announced that it got top performance out of Nvidia's new Blackwell B200 GPUs and AMD's latest MI355X GPUs — crucially on the same software platform.\n\nLattner said Modular got these AMD GPUs to perform roughly 50% better than when these chips run on AMD's own software.\n\nMore importantly, the ability to run different GPUs on the same software stack now supports the tantalizing opportunity to compare Nvidia's offerings with rival AI chips on a more level playing field.\n\n\"The obvious question is: can MI355X compete with Blackwell?\" Modular wrote in a blog announcing the results. \"Early signs point to yes.\"\n\nGibbs, the CEO of Inworld AI, has been putting Modular's software through its paces in the real world.\n\nInworld builds high-speed, real-time conversational AI technology that supports offerings from big companies, including Disney, NBCUniversal, and Niantic Labs.\n\nEarlier this year, when the startup designed a new text-to-speech AI model and got early access to Nvidia B200 GPUs, they issued Modular a challenge: Cut our costs by 60% and reduce our latency by 40% and we'll work with you.\n\n\"Within about four weeks, we were able to get this incredible performance,\" said Gibbs, who signed a partnership deal with Modular soon after. \"I've bet with my wallet.\"\n\nWhile Inworld was mostly lured by Modular's performance gains on Nvidia's latest GPUs, Gibbs likes the flexibility of using different AI chips more easily in the future, if needed.\n\n\"The promise is that we'd be able to move to new hardware,\" he said. \"Let's say AMD takes off, let's say TPUs take off for Google, or there could be other new hardware that comes online. So it's nice to have that optionality.\"\n\nIn fact, Google's TPUs are suddenly having a moment. The internet giant released a new AI model called Gemini 3 to rave reviews recently. That was trained and run using TPUs, and some other AI companies have signed deals to use these chips instead of, or alongside of, Nvidia GPUs.\n\nThat's put Nvidia on the defensive. A project like Modular, with its promise of portability across different AI hardware, adds to this pressure.\n\n\"Nvidia could kill this in a day,\" said Gibbs of the Modular project. \"Nvidia could basically say, 'okay, we don't really care that you run just on Nvidia hardware. Here's a CUDA option that runs on AMD GPUs as well.' It'd be a bit crazy for them to do that, but it's something they could do and that would of course be somewhat bad.\"\n\nFor all Lattner's critique of the industry, he says Modular is not trying to kill Nvidia. In fact, he argues that Nvidia will continue to thrive, even if Modular succeeds spectacularly.\n\n\"We're trying to build something like Android, but for AI hardware,\" he told me, referring to Google's mobile operating system that powers most of the world's smartphones.\n\nDespite billions of people using Android devices, this success didn't kill iOS, Apple's mobile operating system. iPhones still rule in the US, for example.\n\nLattner thinks something similar will happen in AI as Modular's software makes other hardware more competitive, giving developers more freedom, and chipping away at the industry's single-vendor monoculture.\n\n\"So Nvidia doesn't have to die, but we do want more competition. We do want more innovation,\" he said. \"I think that's good for the world.\"\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "The real story of the fight for Warner Bros. Discovery is viewers shifting from studios to tech platforms, impacting how and what you watch.",
    "fullText": "The Warner Bros. Discovery-Paramount-Netflix drama has Hollywood in a tizzy this week — but it's missing one big thing: What about you?\n\nAmericans are deep in a new era of entertainment and are increasingly likely to get their fix on YouTube and TikTok rather than with WBD's popular franchises like Harry Potter and \"Game of Thrones.\"\n\nThe headlines around the deal have focused on whether Netflix or Paramount's David Ellison will win in the boardroom. But the results in your living room will be due to forces that are much bigger than the companies themselves, and have changed the way we watch. Movie theater releases are down, cable TV is dying, streaming prices are likely to rise, and Hollywood's power is waning in the age of tech giants.\n\nThe reason companies like Netflix and Paramount want to buy Warner Bros. is because competition in the entertainment industry is fierce, driven by the decline of cable TV and the rising popularity of small screens and tech companies.\n\n\"If Big Tech never made a move into media, there's a very good chance we wouldn't be seeing this much consolidation as we are now,\" said Brandon Katz, an entertainment analyst at Greenlight Analytics.\n\nNow that Americans spend more time with the big players in entertainment like Google-owned YouTube, Netflix, and Amazon, mergers can help legacy players like Disney, Fox, and Comcast compete. It'll mean lost jobs. The combo that formed WBD led to multiple rounds of layoffs, including about 1,000 roles in mid-2024. Both Paramount and Netflix present themselves as the bigger job savers, but both promise billions in \"synergies\" that will likely result in cuts.\n\n\"The problem is the acquisition and pending consolidation of two media giants, not who the buyer is,\" said The Writers Guild of America, the union representing TV and film writers.\n\nAdditionally, deals offer companies the opportunity to consolidate their brands. WBD has already combined HBO's prestige shows with Discovery's mainstream fare to form HBO Max, and Disney has brought Hulu and ESPN+ into its streaming bundle.\n\nIt all trickles down to what you get to watch, where you watch it, and how much you have to pay. Streaming prices have been increasing while big theatrical movie releases have declined over time, and there's good reason to think those trends will continue, regardless of where Warner Bros. ends up. Industry trends for movie-going are clear, with the number of wide releases and box-office grosses still below their pre-COVID levels.\n\nWhoever ends up with Warner's HBO Max will likely bundle it with their existing streamer and raise the price based on the more expansive offering, Katz said.\n\n\"Within 18 months, all consumers should expect to be paying more for these subscriptions,\" he said.\n\nIt's also widely expected that the combination of two of these companies will lead to less output. That's one of the main objections of Hollywood, whose livelihood depends on stuff getting made.\n\n\"This is one less entity writing checks,\" said Josh Rosenbaum, a producer at Waypoint Entertainment, whose credits have included Yorgos Lanthimos' Oscar-winning \"The Favourite.\"\n\nParamount promised that if it wins the WBD battle, it'll release 30 movies a year in theaters, while Netflix says it'll continue to put Warner Bros. movies in theaters while favoring a quick-to-streaming strategy for its own films. The Disney and Fox merger is a cautionary tale; their combined theatrical releases have declined nearly 50% since the merger was announced in 2017.\n\nThe dinosaurs may be fighting a losing battle. People (especially younger generations) are increasingly getting their entertainment from user-generated platforms. A Hub Entertainment Research survey found that people aged 13 to 24 spend an estimated 21% of their screen time watching non-professional videos on platforms like YouTube and TikTok, compared to just 16% spent on traditional TV shows. In contrast, people aged 35 and up spend 39% of their screen time on TV shows — more than twice as much as they spend on online videos (14%).\n\nThat's put pressure on traditional players. YouTube — not any traditional Hollywood powerhouse — is the No. 1 streaming service on TVs, according to Nielsen. Netflix's engagement per user has stagnated over the past few years, despite the company's increased spending on content, while YouTube has widened its lead on TV screens, according to Bernstein research. Netflix and other leading streamers have taken steps to bring social media-first creators and video podcasters onto their platforms, but show no signs of fundamentally changing their models.\n\n\"The real threat to the media industry in general is the new formats like short form,\" Bernstein analyst Laurent Yoon said. Paramount is at least talking about a technology-led overhaul of how entertainment is made, which has investors intrigued. But whatever changes it makes are likely to be incremental in the near term, he said.",

    "description": "After dealing with endometriosis since she was a teenager, Claudia Zimmerman had a hysterectomy at age 29. This was the start of a 17-year struggle.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Claudia Zimmerman, 48, who went through medically induced early menopause at 29 while working full-time as a nurse manager. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been a registered nurse for almost 25 years, and I've spent the bulk of my career working in labor and delivery and at a fertility clinic. I always felt passionate about women's reproductive health due to my own experiences with endometriosis since I was a teen.\n\nI had stage three endometriosis, a disease that happens when tissue grows outside the uterus. The pain was excruciating, and I went to multiple physicians who dismissed my symptoms as something women just go through.\n\nThis was frustrating and isolating, and it made me doubt the symptoms my body was showing me.\n\nAt 29, I was done having children, and my symptoms were escalating, so I decided to have a hysterectomy to relieve my pain once and for all. The hysterectomy removed my ovaries, uterus, and cervix, which put me into medically induced early menopause.\n\nI knew of the general symptoms of menopause, but nothing could've prepared me for the experience I was about to undergo.\n\nThe next few years were a struggle between my body and menopause. One of the most challenging aspects was working full-time while going through it.\n\nAfter my hysterectomy, I went back to work as an IVF nurse. I didn't become menopausal right away. I had an ovarian remnant that was producing enough estrogen to hold off menopause.\n\nTwo years after my hysterectomy, they removed this third-ish ovary, which then led to the first wave of my menopausal symptoms. I experienced increased anxiety, a bit of weight gain, and increased depression in addition to hot flashes, which I mitigated with estrogen tablets and patches.\n\nMy hot flashes were a slow build that would start with a sudden panic. I'd feel pressure in my abdomen and chest that would take my breath away.\n\nI'd keep getting warmer and warmer to the point where my cheeks would get red, and sweat would leak out all over my body.\n\nIt didn't matter if it was snowing outside or freezing inside; for 30 seconds to up to three minutes, I'd be drenched in sweat, and my heart would race.\n\nI worked alongside many women. I would often turn to them for advice on my symptoms, and they helped me feel empowered and supported.\n\nAt work, I tried a menagerie of things to help combat my symptoms, from drinking iced water, eating straight ice, and bringing in my own fan for my desk, to taking a walk on a break while talking to my mom, who always helped me work through anxiety and fear.\n\nI was so self-conscious about the weight gain. I started wearing larger scrubs so that I could conceal some of the changes, but there were also days when wearing scrubs wasn't an option, like when meeting new patients or traveling from office to office.\n\nGiven that my job was very patient-centric, back-to-back interactions dominated most of my day. On days when I wasn't feeling great, I knew I could share with my colleagues that I \"needed a minute,\" and they would step in immediately to offer their support.\n\nMy coworkers and I were all in our mid-30s, yet our bodies were so different. Although they never made me feel that difference, it was hard for me to ignore.\n\nI often had to remind myself of why I made the decision to get a hysterectomy. It was saving me from decades of severe pain, even though it was forcing me to come to terms with a new version of myself I wasn't ready for.\n\nI experienced menopause symptoms for roughly 17 years. The weight gain and hot flashes were one thing, but the anxiety continued to escalate. I was not prepared for how it seemed to overtake my life seemingly overnight.\n\nAll these changes, coupled with the pressure of my role as a mother and wife, left me feeling resentful and short-tempered. It was hard to sleep more than a few hours at night.\n\nI was so uncomfortable all the time because of these changes. I didn't want others to see me as weak or different, or to judge me.\n\nAdditionally, I was caring for people every day who were going through journeys far worse than my own. I had three children, and I was taking care of people who would do anything just for the ability to have one. I wanted to be strong for them.\n\nAfter 10 years in this fertility practice, I transitioned into benefits management with Progyny, a fertility, family building, and women's health benefits company, as a clinical educator and patient care advocate. When I started working at this new job, just after I turned 40, everything began shifting dramatically.\n\nIn 2018, my body played every trick known to man on me. I was averaging about three to four hours of broken sleep a night. My diet didn't change, but I felt like I had gained 10-15 pounds overnight.\n\nMy anxiety spiked even further. I felt the brunt of it in the evening and the night.\n\nThe weight of fear, worry, guilt, and shame would overcome me, and my thoughts would race during the hours I was supposed to be relaxing and resting. To top this off, my libido vanished, and the short temper I mentioned previously turned into straight anger.\n\nI also experienced a crippling loss. My sweet mother, who had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer only a year before, succumbed to her disease. This devastation wrecked any stability I had left of my mental state.\n\nI was now working from home, so I no longer had to commute up to three hours round-trip to work or be in the clinic.\n\nThis also meant I didn't have to mask my symptoms from colleagues and patients, but it began affecting my family and loved ones. My \"mask\" that I could keep while I was a nurse fully came off.\n\nTo distract myself and shield my husband and children from the person I had become, I threw myself into work. It was the only place I felt any sense of control. My family knew how much I was suffering, and my husband was very helpful.\n\nMy new role focused on helping companies offer fertility, family building, and women's health benefits to their employees. Through my work there, I stumbled on a breakthrough.\n\nAt my new job, I was helping develop a menopause-specific benefit. I was both shocked and elated to learn that menopause-certified clinicians were available through a new digital health platform.\n\nI thought about how incredible it would be for women to access this type of coverage, regardless of how their menopause stories unfolded. As soon as the product went live, I made my first appointment with a menopause specialist.\n\nThe nurse practitioner listened intently as I described my symptoms, as well as the misery and isolation I had felt several years prior. Every aspect of my health was carefully considered, and I received proper, focused care.\n\nAfter three new medications, I was able to sleep eight hours again. I lost 25 pounds, all while maintaining balanced hormones and a balanced diet. I still have anxiety from time to time, but it no longer weighs me down. I'll spare you the details, but my libido once again exists.\n\nThe most important thing an employer can do for its female population is to acknowledge the unique healthcare challenges that women face and be proactive by offering access to this specific type of care. That, and an empathetic ear, will go a long way for the women of their organizations.\n\nMenopause can feel like you're being introduced to somebody that you do not know, which can upend your life, in and out of work. I wish I had known at 29 to advocate for myself, and that eventually things would get better.",

Surge also has a partnership with Anthropic and also runs DataAnnotation.tech, where freelancers can These remote workers are often referred to as \"ghost workers\" for their behind-the-scenes labor that is critical to AI's development.\n\nBeyond any rote work it can entail, Chen said data labeling is a much more creative endeavor. He compared what companies like Surge do to how parents instill lifelong values in their children.\n\n\"I think a lot about what we're doing as a lot more like raising a child,\" he said. \"You don't just feed a child information. You're teaching them values, and creativity, and what's beautiful, and these infinite subtle things about what makes somebody a good person.\"\n\nIn this way, Chen said, companies like Surge AI are \"raising humanity's children.\"\n\nChen's view can also be seen when you navigate to Surge's website, which greets visitors with the question: \"What made Hemingway, Kahlo, and von Neumann extraordinary?\"\n\n\"Their life experiences: war, love, triumph, loss. The people they met, the cities they explored, the thousand choices that made them who they were,\" the website reads. \"Data does for AI what life did for them — transforming it into intelligence that could one day prove the Riemann hypothesis, imagine new philosophies, and send rockets to the stars.\"\n\nChen previously worked in Big Tech at companies including Twitter, Google, and Facebook — and you might remember one of his Twitter projects.\n\nWhile at the company, roughly a decade before Elon Musk would acquire it, Chen became known for making the \"Pop vs. Soda\" map by geo-tagging data from tweets around the US to illustrate which word users used to refer to soft drinks.\n\nLooking back at starting Surge AI, Chen said he was surprised to find out that he never had to stop burying his head in the data.\n\n\"I thought if I started a company, I'd have to become a business person looking at financials all day, and being in meetings all day, and doing all this stuff that sounded incredibly boring, and I always hated,\" he told Rachitsky. \"So, I think it's crazy that didn't end up being true at all.\"\n\nChen said he wishes he had known that you don't need to spend \"constantly tweeting and hyping and fundraising.\"\n\n\"You don't need to become someone you're not,\" he said. \"You can actually build a successful company by simply building something so good that it cuts through all that noise. And I think if I had known this was possible, I would've started even sooner.\"\n\nDo you work in data labeling?

    "fullText": "One of Wall Street's biggest bitcoin cheerleaders has significantly dialed down his forecast for the crypto.\n\nGeoff Kendrick of Standard Chartered, who previously said he saw bitcoin climbing as high as $200,000 by the end of 2025, told clients in a note that the bank has aggressively slashed its price forecasts for bitcoin through the end of the decade.\n\nKendrick said the bank's view is now for bitcoin to end this year at around $100,000, implying 6% upside from the crypto's current levels.\n\nFor next year, he see bitcoin hitting $150,000, about half of the prior target of $300,000.\n\nHere's the rundown of where Standard Chartered thinks the token is headed over the next five years:\n\nThe price target changes were largely spurred by bitcoin's recent sell-off, Kendrick, the global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, wrote in a note on Tuesday. The crypto is down around 27% from its peak in early October.\n\nHe said that bitcoin treasuries — firms that buy and hold bitcoin on their balance sheets — likely won't support the price of the cryptocurrency going forward. Instead, the token will have to rely primarily on ETF buying to move higher, he added.\n\n\"Price action has forced us to recalibrate our Bitcoin price forecasts,\" Kendrick wrote, adding that the firm believed bitcoin treasury buying had \"run its course,\" though ETF inflows could pick up \"periodically.\"\n\nIt's been a rough year for bitcoin, which was rocked earlier in the year as markets reacted to tariffs, and has been weighed down by worries about higher inflation and fewer Fed rate cuts in 2026.\n\nIts latest decline has been brought on by a handful of bearish factors, like low liquidity in the market, a risk-off mood amid rate-cut uncertainty, and speculation that Strategy, the largest corporate buyer of bitcoin, could have to sell some of its token.",

Similarly, 2025 has seen the widespread adoption of AI technology, which has already transformed culture in the three years since ChatGPT debuted in 2022.\n\nKalshi lists ChatGPT among the other Person of the Year candidates, although the platform currently indicates that its odds of winning are only 6%.

    "description": "A single mom spent two years searching for work before noticing her burnout. A moment with her son pushed her to change her routines and recover.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kirsten Bradford, a 30-year-old marketing professional based in Dallas, Texas. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAfter losing my marketing job in 2023, I had no doubts I'd find a new one. I had just earned my master's degree and figured it would help me break into new industries. To find out how wrong I was, especially as a single parent, was scary and confusing.\n\nOver the next year, I spent every day at home applying for jobs, only to feel exhausted and unable to do much else. I felt heavy and numb, like nothingness. I didn't realize how burned out I'd become until my 8-year-old son brought it to my attention.\n\nI looked around at the laundry piled up, the weight I gained, and my dirty room, and realized all the ways my lifestyle was hurting me. I knew I needed to make a change for us.\n\nSince then, I've completely changed the way I approach the job hunt, and that discipline is helping me recover from burnout and feel like a human again.\n\nWhen I got hired for a marketing role at a tech recruitment firm, a lot of the language they were speaking went right over my head. I decided to pursue a master's in business management from SMU Cox to close the learning gap at work. When the school program intensified, and I started pulling myself in too many directions, I was let go from work.\n\nI graduated soon after and started applying to banking jobs, hoping to get my foot in the door. When that wasn't picking up, I figured I'd for sure be able to get a job in marketing given my experience, but nothing came from that either. I just felt so confused. It was scary to go from a full-time salary to nothing, but luckily, my son and I live with my parents rent-free.\n\nIn my first year of job searching, I applied to 278 jobs and only landed two interviews. It had me questioning my worth and wondering if something was wrong with me.\n\nIt was a really sad time, but I kept pushing through.\n\nI realized things needed to change when my son, a chronic co-sleeper who is known to tiptoe into my room in the middle of the night, told me, \"I don't want to sleep here anymore, I don't like the way it feels.\"\n\nI knew it was because of me. My energy was exhausting, and he could feel it; no child should bear the weight of their parents' emotions. That's when I told myself, \"If you're not going to be happy for you, you need to do it for him.\"\n\nWe always used to have fun together. We'd go to the park, downtown, anywhere to spend time with each other. I couldn't remember the last time we went on an adventure. I couldn't even remember the last time I worked out, cooked a proper meal, or even put on makeup.\n\nI don't think my son recognized me, and at that moment, I didn't either, but I wasn't willing to lose my son over it. My favorite job is being a mom.\n\nThe very next thing that I did was pray, and I felt God tell me \"stop.\" I initially dismissed it, but I realized going at full speed hadn't gotten me anywhere. It was time to stop and smell the roses, and know that I gave it my best.\n\nThe first thing I did to get myself out of my rut was to go on walks, inviting my son along when he was ready. Then, I started cooking and cleaning more. I liked how it felt not being a robot whose only task was to apply to jobs.\n\nThe biggest moment of change was when my son and I started going back out again. It was back to the basics. Even if we don't have money, we're still going to have a good time. That's when I started easing back into myself.\n\nI picked up a part-time job in retail at Bath & Body Works to make some extra money. Additionally, I only give myself 90 minutes a day to apply for jobs, probably a few days a week.\n\nThat time usually includes me finding a job I want to apply for, using AI to optimize my résumé, submitting the application, and finding someone to follow up with. I find a lot of jobs from alum groups or referrals. If someone calls me back, great, but if they don't, it's OK. I can't afford to let the job market hurt my spirit anymore.\n\nOutside of that, I follow a schedule. I wake up, take my son to school, work out, cook, and study the Bible or read another book. Right now, I'm challenging myself to read one audiobook and one physical book each week.\n\nMy spirituality has also kept me grounded during this time, and I keep myself very busy.\n\nI'm currently looking for a hobby that'll keep me out of survival mode. I'm thinking of getting more into decorating because I get to use my hands, and it keeps my mind solving problems in a creative way. It's not easy, and it's not stressful.\n\nI've been calling my loved ones more because I have the time, and I've been volunteering more. I've met good people there, and it makes me happy to serve.\n\nOne of the biggest things that's helping me ease out of burnout is having the discipline to stay busy and keep up with my schedule. No matter what I'm doing in a day, I treat it like it's my job.\n\nDo you have a story to share about navigating burnout?

    "description": "AWS executive Sarah Cooper has invented her own roles at the giant using Amazon's 6-page proposal and PR/FAQ frameworks.",
    "fullText": "AWS executive Sarah Cooper has launched several companies and held roles at NASA and AWS, but she's only ever formally interviewed for three jobs.\n\nInstead, Cooper told Business Insider that her career moves often begin with writing a proposal about the work she wants to pursue, either to a VC, a cofounder, or an executive leader, and that becomes the role she steps into.\n\n\"I have a million ideas,\" Cooper said. \"It's a blessing and a curse.\"\n\nCooper has seen a high rate of success with her proposals. She used them to invent both her previous and current roles at AWS.\n\nCooper was previously the head of AWS Industry Products, where she worked closely with customers to develop industry solutions in the cloud. Now she leads the \"AWS AI-Native\" team, an AWS product organization that works with customers to understand how companies will evolve with AI.\n\nCooper said she wrote a proposal to pitch her last two roles, and she's a fan of the six-page memo, a favorite of Jeff Bezos. Instead of PowerPoint decks, Bezos often opted to start meetings by having attendees read a 6-page \"narratively structured\" memo silently at the start of the meeting. The founder has said he prefers memos to avoid \"hiding a lot of sloppy thinking in bullet points.\"\n\nThese six-page memos typically describe detailed plans for a new initiative and are written using 10-point font. Bezos wrote years ago in an annual shareholder letter that \"great memos are written and re-written,\" and can't be done in a couple of days, though the exact criteria remains more flexible.\n\nCooper also referenced using Amazon's classic PR/FAQ framework. The executive said she finds the format \"effective at helping people quickly understand what your idea is and why it matters.\"\n\nAmazon describes the framework as a means to develop ideas and initiatives that enable teams to quickly integrate feedback and promote fact-based decision-making. The press-release portion spans a few paragraphs and provides the reader with highlights of the customer experience. The FAQ section, typically five pages or less, dives into the details and also outlines the challenges of building the product or service.\n\nOnce a draft is written, the creator typically schedules a one-hour meeting with stakeholders to review the document and get feedback, the company said in a blog post about the framework.\n\nCooper said she's written over 14 PR/FAQs and investment narratives that have been funded, as well as many other ideas that the company didn't move forward with.\n\nCooper, who has been at Amazon for over nine years, says she also tries to reflect the organization's values when writing proposals. Amazon's PR/FAQ format originated from a process the company calls \"Working Backwards,\" a method for evaluating new ideas by first defining the ideal customer experience and then reverse-engineering what the team needs to build to achieve it.\n\nCooper said Amazon is \"customer-obsessed,\" so she tries to focus on that value when drafting a memo. She said she thinks less about the needs of a specific team and more broadly about customers and the best way to serve them, regardless of what's been done previously.\n\nWhile Cooper has spent her career writing proposals, many never see the light of day — and those that do don't always go smoothly, she said. In her late 20s, while serving as the CTO of a company, she wrote a proposal suggesting that the business should focus limited resources on scaling the supply chain, specifically with the supply chain involved in on-mine extraction to meet demand for contracts. The company disagreed on where to invest.\n\n\"I got pushed out of one of my companies, basically, for a proposal I wrote,\" Cooper said.",

    "fullText": "JPMorgan may now have the most state-of-the-art building on Wall Street, but about 10 blocks south of the shiny, new, $3 billion fortress still sits the 119-year-old library of the bank's founder.\n\nWith all the focus on the new kid on the block, I decided to pay a visit to the classic, now known as The Morgan Library & Museum, located on Madison Avenue and 36th Street in Manhattan.\n\nCompleted in 1906, John Pierpont (JP) Morgan had the structure built to house his study and library right next to his brownstone residence. Stepping into the original structure, you're immediately transported to the Gilded Age: extravagant paintings line the ceilings of the entry rotunda, deep red wallpaper gives a solemn tone to his study, and wood bookcases display the impressive book collections.\n\nIf you're a finance nerd, you may be disappointed in the lack of Wall Street-specific history in the museum. But if you generally appreciate art and culture as much as JP Morgan apparently did, the place is a must-see.\n\nAs his wealth grew and the fortunes of the powerful families of Europe declined, Morgan amassed pieces from all over the world and from various periods of history, including artifacts from ancient civilizations in the Middle East and Europe.\n\nOne museum guide directed me to her two favorite pieces in the collection: an original Gutenberg bible and the original manuscript of Charles Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol.\" Seeing the works up close was breathtaking.\n\nIn the study, portraits of JP Morgan and his son, Jack, overlook the room. In the corner, a vault holds the most valuable works in the collection. In the library, three stories of bookshelves wrap around the room.\n\nThe opulence of the collection is almost too much — something the museum seems to acknowledge in displaying a political cartoon depicting Morgan pulling artifacts from Europe with a giant magnet. Nevertheless, the museum is worth it if you're a history buff.\n\nOne of the museum's gift shop clerks told me that one of its biggest recent draws was an exhibit on the library's first director, Belle da Costa, who was the library's director from 1905 to 1948. A new historical fiction novel about da Costa called \"The Personal Librarian\" has driven interest in the museum, she said, and is one of the gift shop's top-selling items.",

Business Insider will be covering developments live throughout the day, including economists' insights, market moves, and what it means for your wallet.\n\nCheck back here for updates — and tune into our live Q&A with reporters this afternoon at 4 p.m. ET.\n\nWhile investors expect the Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points, officials will probably send out some hawkish signals to the market on Wednesday, Goldman Sachs said.\n\nFed officials will likely suggest that the bar is higher for rate cuts going into next year, David Mericle, Goldman's chief US economist, wrote in a client note on Sunday. There will also likely be a handful of central bankers who will give \"soft dissents\" on where they see monetary policy going forward in the dot plot, he added.\n\nWhile investors expect the Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points, officials will probably send out some hawkish signals to the market on Wednesday, Goldman Sachs said.\n\nFed officials will likely suggest that the bar is higher for rate cuts going into next year, David Mericle, Goldman's chief US economist, wrote in a client note on Sunday. There will also likely be a handful of central bankers who will give \"soft dissents\" on where they see monetary policy going forward in the dot plot, he added.\n\nThe Fed is expected to pencil in just one more rate cut in 2026, followed by one rate cut in 2027, per Goldman's forecast.\n\nWith 60 minutes until the US stock market opens, it still looks like investors plan to spend Wednesday morning very much in wait-and-see mode.\n\nAs of 8:30 a.m. ET, futures tied to the Dow and the S&P 500 are roughly 0.1% higher, while Nasdaq futures are 0.25% lower.\n\nWith 60 minutes until the US stock market opens, it still looks like investors plan to spend Wednesday morning very much in wait-and-see mode.\n\nAs of 8:30 a.m. ET, futures tied to the Dow and the S&P 500 are roughly 0.1% higher, while Nasdaq futures are 0.25% lower.\n\nMinimal moves in futures mirror Tuesday's quiet trading session, which saw the S&P 500 lose 0.1%, the Dow lose 0.4%, and the Nasdaq gain 0.1%\n\nIf the current pattern of rate cuts continues, American consumers may soon feel relief. Thirty-year fixed mortgages, two-year auto loans, and credit card rates tend to fluctuate alongside the federal funds rate.\n\nAnd, while inflation remains above the Fed's 2% goal, mortgage rates have largely cooled in recent months in anticipation of rate reductions. Lower rates could also make home equity lines and small business loans more affordable — though savers might see less return on their high-yield savings accounts.\n\nInvestors seem to be pricing in a \"sell the news\" reaction to Wednesday's rate decision, strategists at Morgan Stanley wrote in a note on Monday.\n\nThe bank added, though, that it remains optimistic about the market's direction over the medium term.

This past summer, the number of Americans looking for work eclipsed the number of vacancies, though the unemployment rate itself is still relatively low.\n\n\"There is no risk-free path for policy as we navigate this tension between our employment and inflation goals,\" Powell said in October, adding, \"Ultimately, lower rates will support more demand, and that'll support hiring over time. And, of course, we also have to be careful about this.\"\n\nThe Fed's dual mandate is to keep America's prices stable and the labor market healthy. These two goals have been challenging to balance this year: higher interest rates can help curb inflation but risk cooling down an already chilly labor market.\n\nThe Fed is also missing key pieces of data due to the government shutdown. The Bureau of Labor Statistics canceled the October consumer price index and unemployment rate releases, and the November jobs report and inflation data won't be released in time for today's meeting. December's decision will be more difficult without this information.\n\nUS stock futures are virtually unmoved as of just before 6:20 a.m. ET.

    "description": "Pilots being able to control many drones is \"kind of a prerequisite\" for \"the total drone warfare that is coming to all of us,\" Ark Robotics told BI.",
    "fullText": "The future of warfare will demand one soldier being able to control huge swarms of drones that can work together autonomously, a Ukrainian arms maker predicted.\n\nAchi, the CEO of Ukrainian defense firm Ark Robotics, told Business Insider the shift from one drone per pilot to one pilot controlling many is \"kind of a prerequisite to be successful in the total drone warfare that is coming to all of us.\"\n\nWith a one-pilot, one-drone system, the only way to scale up drone fleets is by expanding the number of operators.\n\n\"This is just not sustainable,\" Achi told Business Insider, using a pseudonym as a security precaution. \"You can scale drone manufacturing much more than you can pilots,\" he added.\n\nArk Robotics develops autonomous robots used by over 20 Ukrainian brigades and is creating a system that enables thousands of aerial drones and ground robots, including those not manufactured by the company, to collaborate with minimal human intervention. It's working toward single operator control of many drones.\n\nCountries around the world, from Ukraine to Western allies to rivals like Russia and China, are supercharging combat drone manufacturing. \"You can have all these fancy drones,\" Achi said, but \"what is the use of them if you can't really deploy them at scale?\"\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has involved more drones than any other conflict in history, and innovation in their capabilities has been rapid. The West is paying attention, thinking about what it may need as it worries that Russia could spark a wider conflict with NATO.\n\nDrone technology is critical for Ukraine, vastly outnumbered by Russia's significantly larger military, as it offers mass. But one drone per operator doesn't offer anywhere near the advantage that swarming could. And reducing human involvement and embracing autonomy can accelerate combat action. That's why interest in swarm technology is surging.\n\nThere is no confirmed deployment of large, fully autonomous swarms of drones that can act without significant human oversight on the battlefield, but it would be absolutely game-changing.\n\nThat kind of capability opens up \"a whole world of tactics and strategies that we've not even thought of yet,\" James Patton Rogers, a drone expert at the Cornell Brooks Tech Policy Institute, previously told Business Insider.\n\nThe combat system that Ark is working on, called Frontier, is still in the prototype stage and is just one example of many efforts in Ukraine. The Ukrainian government says the country is pushing for the technology, but \"these systems are also just getting started,\" Achi said.\n\nUkraine demonstrates that quantity can become a kind of quality, he said, explaining that \"to really get an advantage of that, you need these asymmetrical systems that allow you to work with multiple drones at the same time.\"\n\nThat's a lesson for the West as much as it is for Ukraine.\n\nWestern officials, defense experts, and industry insiders have cautioned that to meet Russia's style of warfare — heavily attritional, masses of drones and missiles, and intense artillery barrages — militaries need a greater volume of cheap weapons developed and produced quickly, not a limited stockpile of highly advanced systems developed over decades and produced over years.\n\nDrone swarms are key to that kind of war.\n\nThere's no guarantee that drones would play as significant a role in a war involving the West as they have in Ukraine — in part because Ukraine's reliance on them is tied to shortages of other weaponry and other capability disadvantages.\n\nBut many officials still warn that the West needs far more drone and counter-drone capabilities. Swarming systems are among them.\n\nSwedish Defense Minister Pål Jonson told Business Insider that his country identified the need for drone swarms from watching this war and that it has rushed to produce technology to allow one soldier to autonomously control up to 100 drones. It's not clear when that could be operational. Other NATO members are working on this technology, too.\n\nHowever, there is still no broad NATO-wide investment in these capabilities and no clear sense of when — or whether — they could be fielded. Across the alliance, many officials warn that lessons aren't being acted on fast enough and that production of weaponry remains too slow. It's also unclear how autonomous future systems will actually be.\n\nAchi said the current autonomy in defense systems is \"greatly overhyped,\" but noted that the battlefield shows autonomy is necessary and \"past the point of no return.\"\n\nThere is acknowledgment, from industry and officials, that autonomy is needed to break past manpower limits, increase speed, and keep troops safer.\n\nThe CEO of Origin Robotics, a drone maker in NATO member Latvia that supplies Ukraine, previously told Business Insider he sees autonomy as essential to NATO’s defense, especially for the smaller member states bordering Russia.\n\n\"For a NATO country, you need a scalable solution,\" Agris Kipurs argued. \"Autonomy, in our case, is what allows us to scale. We don't have the numbers in terms of infantry.\"\n\nAchi said he wants Europe not only to learn from Ukraine and catch up to its drone leadership, but to think further ahead. He described Europe as \"having the time\" compared to Ukraine, which is fighting for survival.\n\nIf Europe's increased defense spending \"goes to outdated technology or just wrongly copied technology, it doesn't make any sense to me,\" he said. \"So I want to see them thinking a few steps ahead and taking lessons from the lessons.\"",

    "fullText": "It's human nature to want more of a good thing.\n\nThat's how we ended up with 10 Fast & Furious movies (and counting). It's also how Tom Brady scored his seventh Super Bowl ring, with the Buccaneers, after being cast off by the Patriots.\n\nWhen you've had a taste of greatness, it's normal to keep pushing.\n\nThis same logic can be applied to the stock market. The S&P 500 is up big again, for a third straight year. It's been a veritable bonanza for 401(k)s everywhere. Yet there's a clear dividing line between the haves and have-nots: exposure to the Magnificent 7.\n\nYes, the annual percentage return for the S&P 500 has been solidly in the teens and mid-20s in recent years, but the Mag 7's gain over similar periods have dwarfed that.\n\nEven though everyday investors have been doing just fine, it's normal to have a bit of FOMO about a trade that's doing even better. And although the S&P 500 is naturally weighted towards the Mag 7, why not aspire for more?\n\nThis all begs the question: When will the other 493 companies in the S&P finally feel the same love that the Mag 7 has enjoyed these last couple of years?\n\nThe answer is: potentially soon! At least if the likes of HSBC are to be believed.\n\nWhile HSBC's S&P 500 price target of 7,500 — and its reasons for bullishness — are largely in line with consensus, the firm's view that the S&P 493 could start catching up to the Mag 7 commands attention.\n\nThe main argument is that continued heavy capital spending will slow Mag 7 earnings growth (except for Nvidia, from which the other companies will be buying).\n\nThis is reflected in the chart below, which shows Mag 7 earnings growth (gray line) converging with S&P 493 profit expansion (black line) throughout 2026 after years of outpacing it.\n\n\"That could open the door for companies outside the Magnificent 7 to outperform,\" HSBC's strategists wrote, noting that outsized earnings growth has been key for the tech elite.\n\nThis expansion of returns — known as breadth — will be particularly key for stock-pickers who make their hay when there are more gains to go around. It will also be a key sign of health for skeptics wary of heavy tech concentration.\n\nIf it pans out, it should be enough to placate investors hungry for more. Then it's on to the next aspirational frontier.",

    "fullText": "A startup nabbing a $14 billion investment from one of the top tech companies seems like a good thing. The reality is a lot more complicated.\n\nScale AI has faced a turbulent five months since Meta purchased a 49% stake in the startup, write BI's Charles Rollet and Ben Bergman. Once a leader in the field of stress testing and perfecting AI models for Big Tech, Scale AI has faced pay cuts, poaching, and pivots since the Meta deal.\n\nIt's representative of how dealmaking with big players can be a double-edged sword in the age of AI.\n\nFor some, like Scale AI cofounder Alexandr Wang, who's now a high-level Meta exec, the deal was a windfall. However, according to interviews with five current and former contractors and internal correspondence obtained by BI, Scale AI has faced some inner turmoil following the Meta deal.\n\nJoe Osborne, a Scale AI spokesperson, strongly disputed that the startup's business has been in trouble since the Meta investment and said this quarter is on track to be the company's biggest of the year.\n\nNot all of Scale AI's issues are related to the Meta deal. A BI investigation this June found Scale AI routinely used public Google Docs for work with its Big Tech clients. (There was no indication of a breach, and Scale did lock down the documents after BI's report about the issue.) It also faced litigation over claims it misclassified and underpaid contract workers.\n\nBut one of the larger problems stems from some Big Tech companies pausing work with Scale now that one of their competitors — Meta — is its biggest backer.\n\nThe AI environment means more startups could encounter similar issues.\n\nThe Scale AI-Meta deal was unique in many ways, but there are still lessons to be learned from the aftermath.\n\nThe top-heavy ecosystem of the AI marketplace means there are a limited number of landing spots for startups looking for exit opportunities. Add in the ultra-competitive nature of the space, and a deal with one company could mean the end of business with the others.\n\nOf course, not every startup will get acquired by a tech giant. And yes, some startups will have products that companies will need to use regardless of their backers. But for the vast majority of young AI companies, that's not a reality.\n\nSo, if the industry faces a bit of turmoil and funding dries up, startups may have some difficult decisions about who they cut deals with and which doors could close to them.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Carinne Meyrignac, founder of Cali's Books. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm French, but I absolutely love living in LA. Still, during my maternity leave, I returned to Paris to be closer to my family. There, my baby adored singing books. She was only a few months old, but they kept her engaged.\n\nWhen we returned to America, I couldn't find anything similar. At the same time, I was learning all the English nursery rhymes I hadn't grown up with. I loved singing rhymes like \"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\" and \"Patty Cake.\"\n\nMany French nursery rhymes are surprisingly inappropriate. One popular rhyme translates along the lines of \"I have some great tobacco, but I won't share it with you.\" I didn't want to sing that to my baby.\n\nI liked how most of the English rhymes were happy and upbeat, even if they dealt with dark topics like death (as \"Ring Around the Rosie\" does). I decided to print music books that were fun, joyful, and distinctly American, based on the rhymes my daughter and I both loved.\n\nI've always been someone to take action once I have an idea. I came up with the concept in October 2016, and in November, my husband and I travelled to China to meet with a printer. I've worked in Asia before, and have passable Mandarin.\n\nThe manufacturer had a minimum print run of 3,000 copies, and I wanted two titles: \"Twinkle Twinkle\" and \"Patty Cake.\" We had been saving for a new-to-us used car, but instead of upgrading, I spent that money on books.\n\nLater that year, my son was born. I again went to France on maternity leave, but when I returned, I found I could no longer do my job. I was awarded a settlement during mediation with my employer.\n\nIt was gratifying to have a court say that I had been treated badly. The settlement also gave me the seed money to launch a business — which was important, since I knew I had burned bridges in the niche corporate role I was in.\n\nI was able to leverage my corporate skills, like organization, to effectively grow the business. There were significant adjustments, however, such as not receiving a paycheck every month. Although my husband was still working, I felt a lot of pressure to provide for my family, so that was sometimes scary.\n\nBetween 2019 and 2021 the business revenue exploded. It was bittersweet though: my mother had just been diagnosed with cancer. Because I owned my own business, I was able to spend time in Europe with her until she died. I'm so grateful for that.\n\nAnother milestone came in 2022, when I was able to hire my husband. I don't pay him as much as his previous employer, but now the whole family has flexibility. Then, in 2023, I started paying myself.\n\nToday, the business has published more than 50 titles, and last year we did more than $4.8 million in revenue. I appreciate the independence I have, and I'm proud to be building something tangible that I can leave to my children.",

They'd pose with sad faces and wine bottles or include clever quips about being alone once again.\n\nEvery year, without fail, someone would send me these articles as if I could relate, but I couldn't. To each their own, of course, but I never saw my life as something to be made fun of, and I definitely didn't feel sorry for myself.\n\nSo, I created a new holiday card tradition — one that celebrates my beautiful and full life.\n\nAs I neared 30, I started doing a lot of solo traveling and set the goal of visiting all 63 major US national parks on my own by the time I turned 40.\n\nThough I was posting some of my trips on social media, I also wanted to share them more personally with my friends and family.\n\nFinally, I decided to print a holiday card featuring a photo from a summer trip I took to Canada — a simple shot of my backpack overlooking the mountains of Banff National Park.\n\nI hesitated for a while before mailing them, worried that friends and family might find it narcissistic or odd to receive a card with only me in it.\n\nHowever, many who received the card reached out to express their love for the photo and how happy they were to get it in the mail.\n\nI've kept the tradition going ever since — for nearly 10 years now, through my entire 30s, I've sent a card filled with my favorite photos from the year's solo adventures.\n\nFriends and family often ask well in advance if they're still on my mailing list and tell me how much they look forward to receiving them.\n\nFor me, sharing these more personal photos — the ones I cherish most — in a tangible, intimate way has become a highlight of the season.\n\nCreating the cards each year makes me feel empowered, proud of my accomplishments, and confident in the life I've chosen.\n\nMore than anything, it's a reminder that holiday cards can celebrate joy, connection, and the version of life you're proud to live — however unconventional it may be.",

    "fullText": "Meta is planning to raise prices for its virtual reality devices, executives said in an internal memo seen by Business Insider.\n\nMetaverse leaders Gabriel Aul and Ryan Cairns told employees that the company must \"make a shift\" in its business model to ensure long-term sustainability. This will include measures such as price increases, accounting for new costs like tariffs, and extending the replacement cycle of its in-market devices, per the memo.\n\n\"Our devices will be more premium in price going forward, but we'll have a healthier business to anchor on and free ourselves from feeling existential about any singular device's success,\" Aul and Cairns wrote in the memo, shared with staff on December 4.\n\nThey also called for delivering high-quality software experiences to customers that can match the \"excellence\" of its devices, adding that this may mean \"we ship new hardware at a slower cadence going forward.\"\n\nMeta did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nThe company's flagship virtual reality (VR) headset, the Meta Quest 3, retails for $499.99, while its entry-level model retails at $299.99.\n\nThe move comes as Meta pushed back the release of its new mixed reality glasses, codenamed \"Phoenix,\" from the second half of 2026 to the first half of 2027, as outlined in a product strategy note to staff that Business Insider previously reported.\n\nThe memo announcing the price increases from Aul and Cairns did not refer to its mixed reality glasses. The document outlined three major themes derived from a recent Reality Labs strategy meeting with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CTO Andrew Bosworth. They included how Meta can build a sustainable VR business for the long term, how it can build \"world-class\" software experiences, and how it can accelerate its pace on mobile.\n\nThey also sought to reassure staffers that it remains focused on VR. Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that Meta plans to make budget cuts of up to 30% to Reality Labs, the division responsible for Meta's hardware.\n\n\"We're committed to VR for the long-haul so we need to align our business model and roadmap to an approach that will make this possible,\" they wrote in the memo. \"We've been working hard to bend the curve and accelerate ahead of the category's natural growth rate, which means running multiple programs in parallel as well as carrying costs like tariffs and subsidies for content, GTM, and devices.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "A Tel Aviv startup that uses AI agents to automate HR processes like onboarding and compensation has raised $24 million in funding.\n\nThe HR platform from Shapes essentially offers an app store of AI-based HR tools.\n\n\"It means that you can manage your employees your own way. You can install different apps and agents in order to do the job for you,\" Shapes cofounder and CEO Arnon Nir told Business Insider.\n\nFor example, an AI agent can proactively notify a member of HR that an employee is at risk of leaving, based on data points such as low salary, high performance, and recent absences.\n\nThe startup's AI agents can automate other workflows, such as payroll or contract drafting, based on prompts from HR staff. Employees can use the platform for HR tasks such as booking time off and also ask AI agents for information, including details about company policies.\n\nShapes, which has rebranded from DreamTeam, was founded in 2020 by Nir and Shirley Baumer, who were previously founding members of HR tech company Monday.com.\n\nIn addition to the app store-like structure, which the startup calls \"PeopleOS,\" customers can build their own bespoke applications on the platform using prompts, similar to vibe coding.\n\nShapes says its modular design can help companies scale up and down as the size of workforces fluctuates in the AI era.\n\n\"Every company needs to rethink its structure, its people, its culture. And every company needs to kind of find itself from scratch,\" Baumer told Business Insider.\n\nThe HR tech market is highly competitive, with an increasing number of players — such as Workday and HiBob — integrating AI into their solutions. Nir said the modular nature of its software is one of its competitive advantages.\n\n\"Every company works differently. You want to give them the power to decide what they want to use,\" Nir said.\n\nShapes says it has \"hundreds of customers\" located in 79 countries and spanning 14 industries, including retail, manufacturing, and technology. Its customers include Quantum Machines, NextSilicon, Healthee, Arena Entertainment, and Imagen, according to Shapes. It operates as a software-as-a-service business model, charging a flat rate per employee at the company.\n\nThe funding consists of $15 million in Series A, closed in October, and a previously unannounced $4.5 million seed investment, as well as a $4.5 million seed extension. The Series A round was led by Entrée Capital, with participation from NFX and F2 Venture Capital, which led the seed round.\n\nShapes said it would use the funding to more than double its head count over the next year and expand into new markets.\n\nHere's an exclusive look at the 10-page pitch deck Shapes used to raise $24 million.",

    "description": "Researchers say that overrelying on AI can dull critical thinking, distort expertise, and disrupt how workers learn and advance.",
    "fullText": "Have you caught yourself feeling unusually confident at work — or unsure about errors slipping through your workflow?\n\nA new report from the Work AI Institute, produced with researchers from universities including Notre Dame, Harvard, and UC Santa Barbara, and released on Wednesday, said that AI is turning ordinary office workers into people who feel smarter and more productive while their underlying skills slowly erode.\n\n\"AI is putting expertise into our hands in a way that's not always predictable,\" Rebecca Hinds, head of the Work AI Institute at workplace search company Glean and the report's coauthor, told Business Insider.\n\n\"There's often this illusion that you have more expertise, more skills than you actually do,\" she said. \"Even if you're very well aware you're using the technology, it's often unclear where your knowledge ends and where the technology begins.\"\n\nHinds drew a parallel to the rise of search engines, when people began to mistake easy access to information for genuine understanding.\n\nWith generative AI, she said, that illusion is even more powerful — and the risks are higher.\n\nHinds said these risks are most obvious in creative and knowledge-intensive roles.\n\nWorkers are increasingly using AI to beat the \"blank page,\" she said, and generate first drafts of writing.\n\nThat speeds things up, she said, but it also strips away the messy, time-consuming work of wrestling with ideas.\n\n\"The more you poke holes in it, the more it feels yours and the more you commit to it, and the more you're able to fight for it in a meeting if someone pushes back,\" she said.\n\n\"That process is highly inefficient,\" she added, \"but it's also really healthy.\" And if workers lean too heavily on AI to skip it, \"your skills are going to atrophy.\"\n\nThe report suggested that AI can create either a \"cognitive dividend\" or \"cognitive debt.\"\n\nUsed intentionally, as a partner in domains where you already have expertise, it can free up time and sharpen judgment. However, used as a reflexive shortcut, it leads to weaker skills and misplaced confidence, it said.\n\nHinds said that the roles with the highest exposure are early-career jobs.\n\nThose are the roles that traditionally function as apprenticeships: junior developers learning from senior engineers, entry-level marketers learning how to build campaigns, and young analysts learning how to structure a model from scratch, she said.\n\nIf those tasks are automated away or if juniors rely entirely on AI to do them, they may never develop the underlying skills they need to advance, she said.\n\nHinds said leaders are often unintentionally exacerbating the illusion-of-expertise problem.\n\nA big red flag, she said, is \"organizations stack-ranking employees based on how many times they're clicking an AI tool as a marker of AI adoption or AI productivity or AI success.\"\n\nIn some companies, usage metrics are tied directly to performance reviews.\n\nEmployees \"are incentivized to click the tool more rather than invest in a deep understanding of the tool,\" she added.\n\nInstead, she said, companies should tie AI to existing business goals — quality, customer satisfaction, innovation — and measure whether it actually improves those, not just how often it's used.\n\nHinds doesn't think the solution is to shun AI. She thinks it's to be far more deliberate about its use.\n\nShe recommended three questions for workers and leaders:\n\nAI \"does not magically transform you as a leader,\" Hinds said. \"More often, it amplifies what already exists within the organization.\"",

    "description": "Howard Marks, cofounder of Oaktree Capital Management, said AI could strip people of the structure, purpose, and self-worth they gain from work.",
    "fullText": "That's one of the words legendary investor Howard Marks used to describe the impacts of AI on the workforce.\n\n\"I find the resulting outlook for employment terrifying. I am enormously concerned about what will happen to the people whose jobs AI renders unnecessary, or who can't find jobs because of it,\" Marks wrote in his latest blog post on Tuesday.\n\nThe billionaire and cofounder of Oaktree Capital Management has been writing memos for 35 years; in one recent post, he experimented with using AI to assist him in writing.\n\nTech leaders such as Elon Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have called for versions of a universal basic income — a guaranteed income paid regularly to all adults if jobs become obsolete — as a solution to AI-related job and pay loss.\n\nBut Mark said that even if governments find a way to fund universal basic incomes, it doesn't account for a key issue: That people get a lot more from jobs than just a paycheck.\n\n\"A job gives them a reason to get up in the morning, imparts structure to their day, gives them a productive role in society and self-respect,\" he said.\n\n\"How will these things be replaced? I worry about large numbers of people receiving subsistence checks and sitting around idle all day,\" he added.\n\nThe estimates on how many jobs will be affected by AI vary. An IMF analysis from 2024 suggested that around 60% of jobs in advanced economies will be affected by AI, with half benefiting from the technology and the other being negatively impacted by it.\n\nA McKinsey Global Institute report released last month found that technologies could automate more than half of US work hours.\n\nBut Marks isn't alone in worrying about what happens to meaning when work vanishes.\n\nKate O'Neill, a tech advisor who helps companies navigate AI ethics and digital transformation, said in a recent TED Talk that as we hand more decisions and language over to AI, we risk surrendering a fundamentally human capacity — creating meaning from lived experience — not just losing tasks to machines.\n\nJames Barrat, author of \"The Intelligence Explosion: When AI Beats Humans at Everything,\" told Business Insider he believes people can find new purpose in a universal basic income world through volunteering and community service work — but only after a long, painful transition in which many lose jobs before rebuilding meaning somewhere else.\n\nIf AI is set to reshape work as profoundly as some people expect, tech leaders say young people will need to develop skill sets machines can't easily mimic.\n\nGeoffrey Hinton, the so-called godfather of AI, has said that \"mundane intellectual labor\" roles are most at risk because of AI.\n\n\"I'd say it's going to be a long time before it's as good at physical manipulation,\" Hinton said of AI earlier this year. \"So a good bet would be to be a plumber.\"\n\nOpenAI's chief economist, Ronnie Chatterji, said he is teaching his kids the importance of critical thinking, emotional intelligence, and flexibility — preparing them for a world in which job titles shift faster than curricula can keep pace.\n\nElon Musk recently said that while some of his older children recognize how quickly their skills could be overtaken by AI, he still supports them going to college.\n\n\"If you want to go to college for social reasons, I think that's a reason to go — to be around people your own age in a learning environment,\" he said.\n\n\"If you do, just try to learn as much as possible across a wide range of subjects,\" he added.",

    "description": "It ain't just for physics anymore.",
    "fullText": "There’s plenty of chatter and research surrounding the so-called “laws” of productivity, but even the laws we use to govern other areas of our lives can be applicable when there are things that need to get done. Newton’s Laws of Motion can be adapted to productivity, especially the first one.\n\nNewton’s first law of motion is this: “An object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion remains in motion at constant speed and in a straight line unless acted on by an unbalanced force.”\n\nObviously, he was talking about physics here, but in productivity spaces around the web, people who spend their time thinking about more efficient ways to get things done have started applying his wisdom to people. It makes sense: When you’re on a roll, say, cleaning your house, you kind of get into the zone and keep going. When you’re sitting on the couch dreading and putting off starting to work, it’s really easy to stay there and do nothing.\n\nThe thinking reminds me of the productivity approach I fall back on most often, which I call the \"one more\" trick. Using it, you don't schedule out how long you'll work on a given task so much as you commit to getting started, then continually ask yourself, \"Could I do one more?\" with the \"one\" being any individual part of the overall task. The more you get done, the more motivated you are, and the more likely the answer to that question will be \"yes.\" After years of failed attempts to follow other approaches, this is what I use when I'm cleaning, but it works for a variety of things, from doing reps at the gym to responding to emails.\n\nResearch has looked into how adapting a mindset of getting into and staying in motion can help you be more productive. One review of its use by healthcare workers in a nuclear medicine department found it “novel,” but also able to “have a positive impact on productivity,” for instance.\n\nThe trick isn’t staying in motion, but getting into it, so here’s where you should start. Try adhering to the two-minute rule, or the practice of immediately doing something if it will take two minutes or less. I use this in conjunction with the \"one more\" trick constantly, trying to do something the moment I think of it, or as soon as motivation or inspiration strikes. If an email comes in, respond to it right away. If you need to take the trash out, do it the minute you notice. If you have to cancel an appointment, call that second. Getting in the habit of doing smaller tasks immediately can help you build momentum. When I do pre-plan what I have to work on, I capitalize on the two-minute rule by frontloading my to-do list with simple tasks instead of opting for the “eat the frog” approach, which calls on you to do your biggest, most demanding duties first.\n\nOne day when I was first starting to use this trick, for instance, I had to confirm a ticket order, fill out a W9, order my graduation attire, clean out my entire clothing rack, and do a 12-page paper. By doing the three smaller things first, I built up some positivity and momentum, which helped push me to do the more daunting stuff later in the day. It’s rewarding to see checkmarks fill up your to-do list, so knock out whatever you can in the moment to get that rush and make you want to secure the checkmarks on the bigger items. (I quite literally jot my to-dos down in my notes app and check them off as I get them done, just for the boost.) If you’re using a 1-3-5 to-do list (and you should be!) try flipping your day so you tackle the five small tasks before the three medium-sized ones and large one so you can harness the power of Newton’s law yourself.",

Nowhere else is this more evident than with IO Interactive's Hitman series, which has traditionally given you a playground to let Agent 47 run rampant through, with a variety of different ways to take out your targets.

    "fullText": "on December 10, 2025 at 2:49AM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nWhether it's stalking prey from the shadows or getting in and out without being seen entirely, there's a delightful power fantasy associated with the best stealth games out there. It's a genre that complements so many others, too, combining elegantly with action, puzzle, role-playing, and even turn-based gameplay systems to give them a slightly different spin.\n\nOf course some of the most recognizable in the genre are ones that give you the tools you need to execute your objective in a variety of ways. Nowhere else is this more evident than with IO Interactive's Hitman series, which has traditionally given you a playground to let Agent 47 run rampant through, with a variety of different ways to take out your targets. Ubisoft's Splinter Cell series, by comparison, lets you adopt the role of an apex predator in Sam Fisher, who is as comfortable shimmying in the dark as he is with a knife and a pistol. Arkane's Dishonored series provides its own fantastical spin, too, with immersive sim elements letting you craft your own versions of its protagonists before guiding them quietly through increasingly complex stealth scenarios.\n\nStealth games aren't all about combat, however, and are sometimes at their best when providing you with creative ways to circumvent it entirely. It's a genre that can lean more heavily into its puzzle-solving elements with games like Stealth Inc 2, transform turn-based strategy in Invisible Inc, or provide an entirely unique co-operative experience in the heist-action game Monaco 2.\n\nStealth is a diverse concept that has lent itself to some of the best games out there, so we've selected many of the best the genre offers for you to play in 2025. If sticking to the shadows isn't entirely your speed, you can check out our other lists for the best shooters, the best RPGs, the best racing games, and the best horror games.\n\nIO Interactive has been behind Hitman for decades, but it's the studios' latest entry that has both endured and excited more than anything that came before it. Compiling three game's worth of content under one banner, the World of Assassination offers a wealth of inventive and distinct levels for you to navigate through as Agent 47. Each level has so many layers to it, letting you peel them away as you pursue more crazy and complex objectives with a variety of modifiers (from weapon selection, entry points, and more) keeping you on your toes. Hitman: World of Assassination is like a chest of toys that lets you create your own stories with whatever you pull out and decide to run with, taking the series' action beyond its strictly stealthy origins and redefining the genre in the process.\n\nAlien has had many video game adaptations since it arrived in cinemas decades ago, but none have truly captured the terror of the series like Alien: Isolation. Stripping back most aspects of action and making you feel relatively powerless against a Xenomorph that is stalking you coalesces into a gripping stealth-horror experience that recaptures the high points of the series it's adapting. You'll be staring at your motion sensor for a lot of this game, jumping at any beeps that emit from it and scrambling for the closet locker to hide in as your hunter slinks into view from a vent above. It's a monster that learns from your actions and constantly demands adaptation in order to survive, creating a stealth experience like few others offer.\n\nStealth-action games have generally used 3D spaces to create puzzle boxes for you to quietly navigate, but Mark of the Ninja Remastered flips this on its head by limiting things to 2D. It, however, retains many of the genre's hallmarks, using light and shadow to encourage your movement through spaces, sound as a mechanic you need to manage to stay hidden, and satisfying stealth kills as rewards for getting the jump on foes. Unique to Mark of the Ninja, which makes its limited perspective work even better, is a line-of-sight mechanic that occludes your view of enemies unless you're looking in their direction, with only sound cues giving you an estimation of enemy placement despite having a view of an entire scene. It's a distinct approach to stealth-action that is propped up by an eye-catching visual design and a great soundtrack, making it a classic you shouldn't miss.\n\nIt's difficult to reconcile that the best entry in the long-running (albeit recently dormant) Splinter Cell series is over two decades old, but it also goes to show just how timeless great design can be. Chaos Theory is the third game in the stealth franchise but easily its best, offering the most compelling mission protagonist Sam Fisher has endured while also introducing so many of the series' staples. Each of Chaos Theory's levels were larger and more open than before, giving you different ways to achieve your goal in a manner similar to modern Hitman games. Its use of shadows and dynamic lighting felt generations ahead of other contemporaries in the genre at the time, and still remain a standout feature so many years later. It's stealth action in its purest form that the series strayed from in entries afterwards, and a high bar so many fans would love to return to.\n\nReleased after a long hiatus, Splinter Cell Blacklist feels like a combination of Chaos Theory's perfected classic stealth and the more aggressive stealth-action of Conviction. With three distinct playstyles called Ghost, Panther, and Assault, there is a way to tackle every objective regardless of how much stealth experience you have, and the enhanced Mark & Execute ability lets Sam Fisher operate as a ruthlessly efficient agent of death. It's streamlined and faster than the past games, which doesn't appeal to everyone, but Blacklist is an excellent example of how stealth games don't need to move at a snail's pace to still be stealth games.\n\nWhile the first Dishonored established its captivating setting of Dunwall and introduced players to its blend of stealth and immersive sim gameplay, it was its sequel that allowed its ideas to run wild. It elevates and iterates on the super-powered stealth focus of the original, beefing up options by introducing Emily Kaldwin as a second playable protagonist, but truly finds its footing in the elaborate levels you're unleashed in. From the twisting rooms of The Clockwork Mansion to the time-hopping antics of A Crack In The Slab, Dishonored 2 consistently presents you with intriguing spaces for you to have your stealth prowess challenged, and there's been nothing truly like it since.\n\nYou could make a strong argument for Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater as the best entry in director Hideo Kojima's stealth espionage franchise, which only serves to strengthen the argument that Metal Gear Solid Delta offers the best way to play it. This remake of the stealth action epic takes players right back to the beginning for the Virtuous mission and the origins of Big Boss, with David Hayter's raspy rendition of Naked Snake making a welcome return after his omission in Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. The choice of Unreal Engine 5 breathes new life into this PlayStation 2 classic but doesn't compromise on its vision. This is still a tightly paced linear adventure, just with an updated control scheme and a stitched together structure that make Metal Gear Solid Delta feel like a modern release in the franchise.\n\nThe Metal Gear Solid games were pioneers in the modern stealth genre, but… they didn't always play all that well, especially the first few. With Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, that changed drastically. One of the best stealth-action games of all time, The Phantom Pain borders on immersive sim with its in-world storytelling, and its emergent gameplay structure lets you feel like you're Big Boss on a mission, gathering intel rather than having it spoonfed to you at key points. Capturing enemies to add to your army and making use of key companions further enhances your abilities, and the only real limit to what you can do in a mission is your imagination.\n\nAs a sequel to the surprisingly captivating first entry, A Plague Tale: Requiem does what all good sequels do: it builds on its foundations without straying from them. Playing as Amecia, you're still forced into depending on stealth to avoid and subvert enemies, but now with a greatly expanded move set to go along with it. Amecia is tougher, letting her take more than a single hit before death, which allows you to break and re-engage stealth within a single skirmish. Coupled with more offensive options, like a dagger for stealth kills and a crossbow to take down heavier brutes, Requiem offers more ways to solve each combat puzzle. It also builds on the game's headline feature: killer rats. These light-averse rodents are both friend and foe, and there are few things as satisfying as turning a dangerous environmental enemy into a weapon that can be unleashed on unsuspecting foes.\n\nYou might not immediately think of Naughty Dog's revenge epic as a traditional stealth action game, but it's probably one of the purest examples of it in recent memory. Playing as Ellie, taking on enemies directly isn't always the wisest choice. Being resourceful is far more practical, using bottles and bricks as distractions, a bow and arrow to take out enemies quietly, and relying on up close and personal stealth attacks with your trusty knife. These are tentpoles established by other contemporaries of the genre over decades before, with The Last of Us Part II refining them to a sharp edge. It's a sublime story with a stronger gameplay loop than often given credit for, making it one of the best recent entries into this genre.\n\nAs Assassin's Creed moved more towards action role-playing games set in larger and larger open worlds, a desire for smaller, tighter adventures akin to the series' roots emerged. Assassin's Creed Mirage was an answer to those requests, removing many of the role-playing elements and focusing instead on the best aspects of the series; highpoints from Assassin's Creed 2, Assassin's Creed 4, and more. Playing as BasimIbn Ishaq, you're given the freedom to explore the beautiful city of Baghdad during the Islamic Golden Age. The stealth action brings back the series' \"black box\" approach to stealth, encouraging you to study your environment to reveal new ways to reach and eventually execute your targets. It's a return to form for the series if you've not enjoyed its diversion, and one that should hopefully return with Assassin's Creed Hexe in the future.\n\nThe Assassin's Creed series has taken a few different forms over the years, ranging from the simple social-stealth gameplay of the original to the full-on RPG of Odyssey and Valhalla. In Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, Ubisoft really hit its stride by offering smooth, polished stealth--often intertwined with direct combat--and the titular Brotherhood system. Rather than conquer a mission alone, the game lets Ezio use his recruits to assassinate targets--taking out your primary foe while your buddies leap from the rooftop and eliminate the guards is a joy, and one that very few stealth games have copied since then.\n\nWhat's the point in pulling off the heist of the century if you can't share it with friends? Monaco 2 slips the script on stealth and makes it chaotic fun with friends, as you plan and execute a series of heists across a variety of maps without (hopefully) getting caught and leaving your ill-gotten gains behind. The move to a 3D, isometric view compared to its predecessors flat 2D presentation doesn't lose any of the colourful charm the series was initially known for, while the additional perspective is used thoroughly to expand upon the repertoire you have on offer to distract, misdirect, and evade a series of laser-focused guards and security systems. Monaco 2 is at its best when things don't always go according to plan, forcing you to think on your feet while still keeping things quiet, which makes it a joy with some friends in tow.\n\nAs a sequel to classic stealth platformer Stealth Bastard, Stealth Inc 2: A Game of Clones pushes further into puzzle platforming territory but still features many of the sneaky hallmarks of its predecessor to make this list. This time around you're given access to multiple clones of the goggle-wearing protagonist (influenced by Sam Fisher or not, you tell me), using them to acquire equipment to help you escape the cloning facility you're trapped in. There's an air of metroidvania to the progression, as you use new abilities you've acquired to explore previously visited areas of the facility. All the while, however, you're encouraged to stay clear of various security systems that will end your escape prematurely, circumventing them with useful pieces of gear or some inventive platforming. It's not the purest stealth option on this list but given its lineage and enduring design, this shouldn't be hastily skipped.\n\nWhat if XCOM was more about sneaking? That's the question Invisible Inc. asks and answers emphatically, blending the turn-based tactics of the best out there with the stealth and subterfuge that this genre lives on. Playing as a variety of spies, you're tasked with getting into randomly generated safehouses and picking them clean for what they're worth, whether that's money, equipment, tech, and more. Without many offensive options on offer you're forced to keep things quiet, with lines of sight and noise attracting unwanted attention from armed guards and automated cameras. The turn-based nature makes you methodically move through these random spaces, thinking deeply about not only your movement but the potential movement of those you're trying to sneak past. It's an intoxicating loop that can be as punishing or forgiving as you want, but it's one of few examples of a combination like this working.\n\nAs the age old adage goes: shooting Nazis never gets old. If it did, it's unlikely that we'd be five games into Sniper Elite, with the third-person shooter building its identity around infiltrating enemy camps during World War II and taking Nazis out with gruesome, slow-motion long-distance kills. Given the premise, it's a wonder that the series only started introducing stealth elements in its fourth outing, with the latest Sniper Elite 5 refining them further. It's the series at its best, with massive maps giving you the agency to approach your objectives in whichever way you see fit. Pick out your sniper nest, sneak past enemies to get there, and then line up the perfect shot before quietly exfiltrating to pull off the perfect hit. With a robust weapon customization system and an asynchronous multiplayer mode (which pits an enemy player sniper against you during missions), Sniper Elite 5 is a sniper power fantasy done right.\n\nThough we chose the first game in the series for this list, we truly could have picked any of the Sly Cooper games and they would have deserved it. Appropriate for younger players--as long as you don't mind stealing--and combining stealth elements with simple platforming, Sly Cooper is a unique series that exemplifies the mascot-heavy days of the PS2. Joined by his partners in (literal) crime, Sly Cooper is a master of stealth and traversal, and the game's de-emphasis of direct combat stands in stark contrast to many other games of the era. It was followed by two sequels on the PS2 and a third on the PS3 and PS Vita, and we're eager to go on another adventure with the cute little guy.\n\nSome of the best stealth games blend other genres together to create something that would simply be impossible in the traditional action-adventure framework. That's the case with Gunpoint, a retro-style puzzle-platformer that is more about finding the solution to a problem than it is avoiding enemies and traps on the fly. The primary way you'll do this is with the Crosslink tool, which lets you change security systems for your own benefit. But just because it's a puzzle game doesn't mean there is only one solution, giving you incentive to replay levels and figure out the cleverest ways to make it through each challenge.",

    "description": "Baldur's Gate 3 has been out for over two years now, but fans' enthusiasm for the sprawling RPG remains strong--as is the case with one fan who has spent untold hours documenting and quantifying all the spoken dialogue in the game.\nRedditor Everwhite-moonlight has taken the time to catalogue the game's extensive spoken dialogue fans, calling the labor-intensive task a celebration of Larian's work. The finished spreadsheet arranges the characters in order from most to least speaking time, which reveals just how much our vampire friend Astarion loves to talk.\nIt's unsurprising that Amelia Tyler's Narrator, whose voice is ever-present through Baldur's Gate 3 as the game's pseudo-DM, has the most lines of dialogue, clocking in at a total of 14 hours and 43 minutes of speaking time.

    "title": "The Best Albums of 2025",
    "description": "David...",
    "fullText": "From Mavis Staples to the Kronos Quartet—these are our music critic’s favorite works from this years.\n\nThe Lebanese Civil War. Corporate agri-capitalism. Tips for surviving a nasty divorce. Violence, unfettered avarice, and the need to hold on to your heart—all of these, among other timely themes, infuse a group of widely varied but generally excellent albums released over the past year. A horrible time in so many ways that we know all too well, 2025 also gave us some terrifically inventive, ear-stretching, and entertaining music. It was an exceptionally good year for music, in fact, especially for music that engages bad times incisively and offers up ideas for how to survive.\n\nMany of the most inventive recordings were hybrid works, carrying on the genre-blending and style-blurring that virtually defines music in every category these days, making the very idea of categories quaint. I’ve been curating lists like this one for decades, and when I started, early in the 21st century, it felt strange to mingle albums of pop and jazz and hip-hop and classical and other kinds of music; but now, everything seems at home with everything else. If only that sensibility of companionable differences, of strength in unity, carried through the rest of the world.\n\nMy picks for the 11 best albums of 2025, in alphabetical order by artist:\n\nPronounced “Artemis,” after the Greek goddess, ARTMS is a fab K-pop quintet spun out of the South Korean teen-idol factory Loona, and their music is the scientific formula for pure joy converted to sound. Bouncy and playful, with strains of retro hip-hop beats and undercurrents of EDM tonality, the six songs on this EP have a flawless sheen that’s simultaneously enchanting and, in its meticulous flawlessness, a little unsettling. (Not to be confused with the superb American jazz quintet Artemis, who also released an exquisite new album, Arboresque, this year.)\n\nAn unclassifiable composer of seemingly inexhaustible imagination, Hearne combines narratives of William Penn and Jeff Bezos to spin Big Tech capitalism as settler colonialism by digital means in this audacious techno-pop song cycle. The libretto is adapted from historical archives and contemporary texts, cut-and-pasted over sound constructed by Hearne from sampled sources. Farming is performed by Hearne and the magnificent Philadelphia-based choral group the Crossing, under the direction of Donald McNally.\n\nThis three-piece experimental metal band plays in black robes, wearing masks of Apollo, Hecate, and Baal, and cheeky mythic cosplay boils over in the plastic cauldron of their music. Goldstar, their seventh album since the group formed in 2012, is a blood feast of courses cooked up from death metal, jazz, and new music. Are these guys serious? I hope so. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be so deliciously silly.\n\nThe Armenian American composer and documentarian Mary \nKouyoumdjian, a nominee for the Pulitzer Prize in Music in 2024, collaborated with the celebrated musical adventurers Kronos Quartet on two suites of oral-history testimony—about two bloody conflicts that her family endured—set to chamber music on this gravely serious and stirring album. “Bombs of Beirut” is a three-movement sound collage employing audio from interviews that Kouyoumdjian conducted with her family about the Lebanese Civil War of 1975–1990, while “Silent Cranes” draws from archival materials about the Armenian Genocide of 1915.\n\nI don’t want to get into a comparison of Taylor Swift and Lady Gaga, but… actually, I do. I enjoyed Swift’s 2025 release, The Life of a Show Girl—but while it’s fine, it’s filled out with puffy sound-alikes of her earlier songs and doesn’t hold up as a concept album. Lady Gaga’s Mayhem is pure pop on a higher level: fresh and tuneful, with winks at her earlier music that feel wryly self-aware, not self-plagiarizing. It’s an album of smart pop that doesn’t pander, by an artist who can make any kind of music she wants to but makes pop the best.\n\nFollowing a tempestuous split from her longtime collaborator, Inflo, the London-based hip-hop artist Little Simz enlisted a new producer and cowriter, Miles Clinton James, for this pulsing, finely textured album, full of quick and jabby rapping. The sonic atmosphere is bright and alive, with trap-kit drumming and analog instruments (piano, guitar, saxophone) helping to show off Simz in full bloom.\n\nThis out-of-left-field project could have come off as a gimmicky mishmash, but it works, inexplicably. Morgan, a jazz bassist best known for his lyrical playing with guitarist Bill Frisell, has invented a digital instrument using SuperCollider, a three-decade-old computer-programming platform. Almost but not quite AI, it is generative within limits and has a retro sound that’s a near-amalgam of a marimba, a zither, and Squidward’s clarinet. Morgan programmed it to play in trios with himself on bass and a series of guest instrumentalists from the top ranks of jazz, including Frisell, Henry Threadgill, Ambrose Akinmusire, and Craig Taborn, along with the poet Gary Snyder on the closing track. All of them sound like they’re having a blast jamming with Morgan’s funny old robot.\n\nEclectic and rangy, Pulp has always come across as more mature than its vain, sex-obsessed lead singer and principle lyricist, Jarvis Cocker. After a 10-year break from playing together, the group has reunited and released its first album in 24 years. Cocker is 62 and now has other things to sing about, including the regrets and feelings of resignation that often come with age. This is a sober album, but a Pulpishly eclectic one: vintage Brit-pop charm mixed with oddball dashes of jazz, music hall, and Weimar cabaret.\n\nLux is one of the richest and most impressive works of music I’ve heard in years. It’s grand in scale, a kind of orchestral art-pop, with music cowritten or arranged by Björk, Caroline Shaw (the Pulitzer Prize–winning multi-hyphenate), and a list of others from the realm where classicism and adventurism intersect. It’s just as grand thematically, tackling matters of womanhood, mysticism, and love in its varied forms. Over 18 tracks divided into four movements, classical style, Rosalia sings with ardor in 14 languages, though you don’t need to know any of them to be moved by this music.\n\nThe sorrows and the joys of life both come through in this elegiac new album from Mavis Staples, the sole surviving member of the Staple Singers. Backed by marquee stars of Americana, blues, and roots music (Buddy Guy, Jeff Tweedy, Derek Trucks, Katie Crutchfield, Patterson Hood, and more), Staples sings a selection of reflective songs, most of them relatively recent (the title track, by the late Mark Linkhous) or new (“Human Mind,” written for the album by the Canadian singer-songwriter Allison Russell). She sounds magnificent, subtly tapping all the sadness and beauty in a voice weathered by 86 years in this world.\n\nFive years after announcing her hiatus from performing, the R&B singer and songwriter has returned with an epic account of suffering and surviving a tumultuous divorce. Taylor’s back in a big, big way—and I’m not talking about her star-making turn in One Battle After Another. Escape Room is essentially an oratorio disguised as a pop album, with nine segments of spoken word by guest artists (including Sarah Paulson, Niecy Nash, and Jodie Turner Smith) interspersed between 22 original songs of raging, yearning, and exulting in freedom.",

    "fullText": "When Joe Heyes toured New Zealand in July 2024 he was miserable.\n\nOut of contention for England's matchday squad and suffering with a back spasm, the prop would hole up after training, sailing and killing his way around the 18th Century Caribbean from his hotel room.\n\nAssassin's Creed: Black Flag - a console game - was his focus, rather than the All Blacks.\n\n\"I had a horrible time. I hated it,\" said Heyes of that tour.\n\n\"I hated rugby. It had become a bit of a job to me, a bit of a chore, and it shouldn't be that.\"\n\nLeicester had just finished eighth in the Premiership. As well as a glitchy back, Heyes had suffered with neck and calf problems.\n\nWith Will Stuart and Dan Cole locked in as first and second choice at three for England, Heyes felt like he was making up the numbers - and probably should not have even been doing that.\n\n\"I didn't feel like I deserved to be on that tour in the first place,\" he said.\n\n\"That brought a lot of self-doubt within me.\n\n\"I thought to myself, 'I'm not playing against Japan [whom England had beaten en route to New Zealand]; I'm definitely not playing against the All Blacks'.\n\n\"I thought, 'I've got four weeks now of not really being involved and not feeling part of the team'.\n\n\"That was on me - not down to anybody else - but it was an incredibly challenging time.\"\n\nA little more than a year on, Heyes is emphatically part of England's team. He played in every Six Nations game and started the wins over Argentina, Australia and Fiji.\n\nWhen the All Blacks came to town this November he started once more, facing the haka, besting Ethan de Groot at the scrum and departing the pitch after 56 minutes with England leading 25-12.\n\nHe left New Zealand last year having completed 97% of Assassin's Creed.\n\nHe left Twickenham this year as part of only England's ninth win over the All Blacks.\n\nHeyes knows which stat he prefers.\n\n\"I was thinking, 'wow, this is the feeling - this is what I've wanted for so long', and it was worth the wait,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm kind of glad I had a that time down there (in New Zealand) now. I needed a bit of a wake-up call.\n\n\"Without it I probably I would have just would have kept on dawdling my way through and hoping something would have happened.\"\n\nMichael Cheika helped complete the turnaround.\n\nOn Cheika's return to Leicester in 2024, Heyes confided in the newly appointed coach that professional rugby had become a grind.\n\nAustralian Cheika told Heyes to make his career simple and make it his.\n\nIf Heyes wanted to do his gym work away from the rest of the team, that was fine. He didn't have to worry about what he couldn't do - just focus on his strengths.\n\n\"He just simplified things in terms of taking a bit more ownership,\" said Heyes of Cheika, who left Leicester after one season and a campaign that ran all the way to the Premiership final.\n\n\"It was a really good conversation. We still text sometimes - a little bit about the visualisation of climbing the mountain - how your Everest is the season.\n\n\"Every night I'll write something down in terms of how the day went, or if I have an issue or problem.\n\n\"It was a year of some good rugby, but it was also a year of self-exploration.\"\n\nWith Geoff Parling having taken over at Leicester, this campaign also looks promising.\n\nThe Tigers, who are responsible for defending champions Bath's only Prem defeat, sit fourth in the table.\n\nThey take on Leinster at home on Friday, needing a win to keep alive their chances of making the knockout stages of the Champions Cup for a fifth successive season.",

    "fullText": "Apple and Google want to simplify data transfer between their iOS and Android platforms, support more data formats, and enable wireless transfer. The EU welcomes this step, stating: The Digital Markets Act is showing its effect.\n\nThe EU Commission has sent a statement to 9to5Mac. In it, a Commission spokesperson says about Apple and Google's cooperation in this area that it is an \"example of how the Digital Markets Act (DMA) benefits users and developers\".\n\nThe EU further states that this solution allows users to easily transfer data from iPhone to Android and vice versa when setting up a new device. According to the report, the transfer is intended to support \"many types of data\" – including contacts, calendar events, messages, photos, documents, Wi-Fi networks, passwords, and also data from third-party apps. Unlike previous solutions, the optimized method will also be wireless.\n\nAccording to the EU, the more seamless cross-platform data transfer follows the introduction of eSIM transfer by Apple and Google last October. Currently, however, this solution is only supported by a few network operators, but also by some outside the EU.\n\nBoth solutions are the direct result of the DMA, which \"requires effective data portability\" from certain services – including iOS and Android, the EU statement continues. Apple has summarized its work on this project in its DMA compliance reports from March 2024 and March 2025. Furthermore, the solutions are possible through extensive technical work and collaboration between Apple and Google, as well as through intensive discussions with the Commission over the past two years, according to the EU spokesperson.\n\nUnlike numerous features that Apple offers exclusively to its customers in the EU, such as alternative marketplaces, the seamless data transfer between platforms will be provided worldwide. For Apple, the solution is likely to be a win to attract new customers from Google's Android. This could, of course, also happen the other way around, with Google poaching from Apple. For consumers, the new solution means no longer being necessarily trapped in one of the two platform worlds.\n\nIncidentally, Apple will have to open up its iOS and iPadOS even further in the future, so that headphones and smartwatches, for example, work more seamlessly with the operating systems. These requirements are not at all to the company's liking, and it wanted to prevent this. The iPhone maker and Google are also not big fans of the Digital Markets Act: Apple would prefer to abolish the law, Google wishes for a reset, as it causes significant collateral damage in its current form.\n\nDon't miss any news – Facebook,\n LinkedIn or\n Mastodon.\n\nThis article was originally published in\n\n German.\n\n It was translated with technical assistance and editorially reviewed before publication.",

    "title": "I Tried the New Android XR Smart Glasses from Google and XReal",
    "description": "Google's Android XR platform and XReal's Project Aura are bringing smart glasses closer to mainstream reality, offering developers powerful tools to create practical, everyday wearable experiences that go far beyond novelty gadgets.",
    "fullText": "Google's Android XR platform is still in its early development stages, but it's full of potential. Designed to bring consistency to mixed reality (XR) headsets and smart glasses—essentially an \"Android for XR\"—it aims to address the fragmentation that has long hindered the category's growth. Currently, only one Android XR device is available for purchase, Samsung's $1,799 Galaxy XR, and trying it out impressed me enough to nominate it and Android XR for a TechEx award.\n\nStill, the Galaxy XR, with its Apple Vision Pro–style design, doesn't show what Android XR can mean for smart glasses specifically. Now, Google has finally provided that clarity by unveiling two of its own smart-glasses development kits and pulling back the curtain on XReal’s Android XR–powered Project Aura. After trying all three, I’m more convinced than ever that Android XR could mark a major leap forward for smart glasses, maybe even more than for headsets.\n\nGoogle’s Android XR development kits are designed for developers and manufacturers seeking to create products and experiences that rival those of the Meta Ray-Ban Display and similar smart glasses. They use a color display that combines an embedded microprojector with a special pattern etched into the lens, known as a waveguide, that directs images into your eye. Waveguide displays are limited in terms of field of view and resolution, but they can be much smaller and lighter than other types of wearable displays, enabling smart glasses that aren’t much bulkier or heavier than ordinary specs.\n\nThe two Google development kits are completely wireless, running on their own batteries, and connect to an Android phone for all software processing. They’re nearly identical, with the only difference being that one has a monocular display that only shows a picture to the right eye, and the other has a binocular display that can show images to both eyes. The binocular version can produce stereoscopic 3D images that appear to have depth, but the monocular version is lighter, weighing just 1.73 ounces (49 grams). For what it’s worth, I didn’t feel much of a difference in weight between the two.\n\nI got to try several Android XR activities on the Google smart glasses, giving me a good sense of how this type of device will work in the real world. To start, I tried YouTube Music on the monocular pair, which played audio into my ears and displayed a widget on the screen with track information and playback status. Tapping and swiping a touch strip on the right temple of the glasses let me play, pause, and skip tracks easily. The widget was sharp and easy to read, which is obviously vital for any smart glasses with a display. The music sounded fine as well, but I was indoors in a relatively quiet room. Of course, as development kits, their hardware components will likely differ from those in retail-ready products, so don’t read too much into the audio or video quality. The demo focused on the experience and features, as well as how Android XR, as a platform, can work on smart glasses.\n\nThe next demo was an incoming Google Meet video call. A Google rep called the phone number connected to the glasses, and I answered by tapping the touch strip. Her face appeared on the glasses display, in color, and I could see her talking, just as if I were on a video call on my laptop. She couldn’t see me since there wasn’t a camera pointed at my face, but I could share my own view through the glasses’ cameras with a swipe. Again, the call looked and sounded good, and I didn’t experience any hiccups.\n\nNavigation through Google Maps is baked into Android XR, so I was shown how it can work on the glasses. I asked for a nearby store, and it provided me with a few options. After I chose one, I saw a directional arrow and distant measurements for turn-by-turn directions to that store. Looking downward, the arrow transformed into a full map of my surroundings. It seemed to work very well and tracked the direction I was facing, although I couldn’t exactly walk anywhere to see how accurately it followed my location. Having a video game-like minimap in reality has long been one of my dreams for smart glasses, and it appears we’re getting closer to that. I hope that the Android XR Google Maps app will allow me to configure when and how the map appears, so I don’t have to look at my feet for it, but I couldn’t confirm if those options will be available.\n\nGoogle is pushing Gemini hard, and it’s no surprise that AI plays a significant role in Android XR. On waveguide smart glasses running Android XR, Gemini is always available with a button press and a wake word, ready to perform simple tasks like playing music or making a call, or do more complex analysis like answering questions or identifying what you’re looking at.\n\nDuring the demo, I was invited to ask Gemini for recipe suggestions while viewing a pantry wall filled with ingredients. I stared at a few jars of pasta, and it provided instructions on making pasta salad. Gemini could see the foodstuffs I was looking at and not only successfully named the pastas but also correctly identified sweet potatoes, and even noted that they were likely American sweet potatoes rather than Japanese or Korean ones. That kind of machine vision processing is far more impressive to me than large language model (LLM) outputs of recipes.\n\nAll of the demos described above felt very familiar, because I had similar experiences with the Meta Ray-Ban Display when I tried it out. In fact, asking an AI to produce a recipe based on the ingredients you’re looking at is a page straight out of Meta’s playbook, though my Android XR demos never failed as the on-stage Meta Connect presentation did. The functions are indeed very similar, but the difference lies in how the underlying systems are intended to be used. Android XR is a broad platform for third-party developers and manufacturers, featuring core features and elements that can be used directly or built upon, depending on the final product. The Meta Ray-Ban Display’s operating system is the final interface for a specific product. It doesn’t even have a public-facing name like Android XR or Apple’s visionOS. Android XR is a first step for an entire ecosystem, and Meta Ray-Ban Display might receive upgrades and iterations down the line, but it isn’t going to drive a field of non-Meta glasses.\n\nAlso, the Meta Ray-Ban Display is monocular, which means Google’s binocular development kit could show me some new tricks with 3D. After putting on the binocular glasses, I was shown some 3D video on YouTube. It indeed looked nice and 3D, and was fairly watchable. The binocular glasses also provided a 3D view of the city when I brought up Google Maps. As I mentioned before, though, waveguide displays have a limited field of view, so even if the picture is fairly sharp and in full color, I’m not sure I’d rely on this type of glasses to watch a full show or movie. In fact, the reps noted that watching longer-form video content here wasn’t an intended use case, though being able to play shorter clips is certainly handy.\n\nThe 3D features are nice but not vital to the experience. They can make using the glasses feel more immersive, but they aren’t why I favor binocular smart glasses. I find having a display in only one eye slightly disorienting compared with being able to see the same picture through both eyes. While I can quickly get used to it with the display in my dominant right eye, people with dominant left eyes could possibly find it more awkward to use, or at least a bit less pleasant.\n\nThese Android XR glasses feel like a significant step in making wireless, waveguide display smart glasses truly accessible to users. I’ve tested several, like the Rokid Glasses and the Even Realities G1 (and I’m currently testing its successor, the G2), and they’ve been very inconsistent and unpolished. Some, like the Rokid Glasses, have useful features and seem reliable enough if you get through the learning curve, but I haven’t been able to recommend any of them without major caveats. They also feature monochrome green displays rather than color, which has also been frustrating.\n\nI haven’t fully tested the Meta Ray-Ban Display outside of supervised demos yet, but while they seem like some of the most refined waveguide smart glasses so far, they’re also purely Meta products, using a closed system with limited room for outside development or growth. Google’s development kits demonstrate how Android XR can be implemented consistently by multiple manufacturers, serving as templates for developers to create their own apps. It’s what smart glasses like these have sorely been needing, and what could push this particular sub-category past its current status as shaky early-adopter hardware.\n\n Policy.\n\nYour subscription has been confirmed. Keep an eye on your inbox!\n\nThen there’s XReal’s Project Aura, which has turned out to be a completely different beast and much closer to the Samsung Galaxy XR than Google's waveguide development kits. XReal is another major manufacturer, besides Samsung, working with Google to introduce the first Android XR devices, and I got to try its Project Aura smart glasses along with the other devices.\n\nProject Aura is a pair of smart display glasses that use bulkier prisms instead of a waveguide system, but offer an incredibly wide 70-degree field of view. It doesn’t fill up your entire vision with a picture (even the Galaxy XR, with its 109-degree field of view, doesn’t do that), but it still looks like a huge theater screen in front of you. On the virtue of its display alone, it’s more impressive than other prism smart glasses, and with a much wider view than my current top pick in that category, the 57-degree XReal One Pro.\n\nThe display isn’t the most interesting thing about Project Aura. Its claim to fame is that it’s an Android XR pair of smart glasses, and unlike the Google waveguide glasses, it’s fully self-contained. It connects through a wire to a phone-sized control box that runs Android XR as its own operating system. Inside that box is a Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 processor, the same chip that drives the Galaxy XR. In other words, this pair of smart glasses has about the same processing power and capabilities as Samsung’s bigger, bulkier headset. Its picture isn’t as big or sharp, and it doesn’t have as many outward-facing cameras, but it has the same brain, the same interface, the same apps, and the same intuitive hand-tracking control.\n\nWhen I put on Project Aura, I was greeted with a tutorial I recognized from using the Galaxy XR. The glasses directed me to hold my hands in front of me and point at objects. I selected them by aiming with my finger and could click on them with pinching gestures or even grab and move them around. The same gestures applied to icons and app windows as well, allowing me to point and pinch to open new apps, resize them, and move them around. I could even bring up both the home screen and a quick menu by turning my palm to face me and making the pinch gesture. It felt exactly like the Galaxy XR, and I picked it up instantly.\n\nProject Aura appears to be capable of nearly everything the Galaxy XR can do. I was able to open multiple apps, arranging Chrome, Google Maps, and YouTube around my view. I could play a game called Demio that projected a 3D tabletop RPG view in front of me. I could also connect to a nearby computer directly and play games through it with minimal lag.\n\nI hailed the Galaxy XR’s control system as the best I’ve used in a headset since the Apple Vision Pro, which I still consider the most advanced and intuitive mixed reality device I’ve reviewed. It requires no controller or touchpad—you just point and pinch. This control system is incredibly rare on headsets, but seeing it in a much smaller and lighter pair of smart glasses? I wasn’t expecting that.\n\nSmart glasses, especially ones with a display, have struggled with controls. The waveguide models I’ve tested, as well as the Google development kits, all rely on voice controls or buttons and touch strips on the temples. The Meta Ray-Ban Display features the Neural Link Band, which tracks the micro-gestures of your hand, but I found it to be inconsistent when I tried it. Tethered prism display smart glasses rely entirely on the connected device for controls, with the exception of a basic button-based settings menu at best. Project Aura is a full, standalone Android XR device that supports hand-tracking and gestures, and it’s the most intuitive way to use smart glasses I’ve ever seen.\n\nSince it’s a pair of smart glasses and not a full headset with a strap, Project Aura is much easier to put on and take off than the Galaxy XR, and it feels much more comfortable to wear. You can also see through it when the power is turned off, since its projection system relies on clear prism lenses. You shouldn’t use Project Aura while walking around as you would with waveguide display smart glasses, though; the prism lenses might be transparent, but they’re still thick enough to warp your outside vision enough to be uncomfortable at best and dangerous at worst. Prism-equipped smart glasses like these are best used when stationary or in a controlled space, such as a larger mixed reality headset, rather than when crossing the street or riding the subway.\n\nProject Aura has a few disadvantages to go with its smaller, more convenient form factor. The display is the biggest part, since it’s noticeably narrower than the Galaxy XR’s. While the view is still huge for smart glasses, it isn’t as immersive as the headset’s, and its 1080p resolution isn’t nearly as sharp as the Galaxy XR’s 3,552 by 3,840 pixels per eye. Because it doesn’t have as many cameras, there’s a slightly smaller area where it can track your hands; I didn’t need to hold my hands directly in front of my face, but I couldn’t leave them in my lap like I can with the Galaxy XR or the Vision Pro. It also lacks internal cameras for eye tracking, so you must use hand movements instead of your gaze for control.\n\nEven with its limitations, I found Project Aura to be incredibly exciting. I’ve been using prism-based smart glasses, particularly the XReal One Pro, for working away from my desk and watching videos and playing games on my phone, and they have been very useful for that. Those use cases all require connecting the glasses to a separate device, such as a phone or laptop, and controlling everything through that device’s touch-screen, controller, or mouse and keyboard. Project Aura works entirely on its own (and as an Android-driven device with Bluetooth, it can also work wirelessly with controllers and keyboards, if you want). The control box is technically still a separate device that connects to the glasses with a cable, but like with the Galaxy XR and Vision Pro, it can be slipped into a pocket and treated like a battery. Combining the convenience of prism smart glasses with the capabilities of a high-end XR headset makes Project Aura feel like the next big leap in smart glasses as a whole.\n\nUnfortunately, you won’t be able to get Project Aura any time soon. My close look at the glasses came with an important detail: It’s a development kit. When Project Aura launches next year, it will be targeting developers and won’t be available for general purchase. So, like with the Google development kits, unless you’re planning to work on Android XR apps, you probably won’t be getting your hands on Project Aura.\n\nI didn’t hear anything about pricing, either, though considering it packs more impressive hardware than the Meta Ray-Ban Display, I wouldn’t be surprised if devs will be shelling out as much for it as they would for the $1,799 Galaxy XR. As for retail-ready Android XR smart glasses, don’t expect to see anything until late 2026 at the very earliest.\n\nI’m PCMag’s home theater and AR/VR expert, and your go-to source of information and recommendations for game consoles and accessories, smart displays, smart glasses, smart speakers, soundbars, TVs, and VR headsets.

    "description": "Generating graph-structured data is crucial in applications such as molecular generation, knowledge graphs, and network analysis. However, their discrete, unordered nature makes them difficult for traditional generative models, leading to the rise of discrete diffusion and flow matching models. In this work, we introduce GraphBSI, a novel one-shot graph generative model based on Bayesian Sample Inference (BSI). Instead of evolving samples directly, GraphBSI iteratively refines a belief over graphs in the continuous space of distribution parameters, naturally handling discrete structures. Further, we state BSI as a stochastic differential equation (SDE) and derive a noise-controlled family of SDEs that preserves the marginal distributions via an approximation of the score function.",

    "fullText": "If search interest holds, glitchy glam, cool blue, aliencore and gummy bear aesthetics are among the vibes set to rock the creative world next year\n\nNext year, we’ll mostly be indulging in maximalist circus decor, working on our poetcore, hunting for the ethereal or eating cabbage in a bid for “individuality and self-preservation”, according to Pinterest.\n\nThe organisation’s predictions for Australian trends in 2026 have landed, which – according to the platform used by interior decorators, fashion lovers and creatives of all stripes – includes 1980s, aliens, vampires and “forest magic”.\n\nAmong the Pinterest 2026 trends report’s top 21 themes are “Afrohemian” decor (searches for the term are on the rise by baby boomers and Gen X); “glitchy glam” (asymmetric haircuts and mismatching nails); and “cool blue” (drinks, wedding dresses and makeup with a “glacier aesthetic”).\n\nPinterest compared English-language search data from September 2024 to August 2025 with those of the year before and claims it has an 88% accuracy rate. More than 9 million Australians use Pinterest each month.\n\nWednesday’s report found searches for 1980s luxury soared by 225%, “Scotland Highlands aesthetic” by 465% and “the poet aesthetic” by 175%. “Poetcore” – a key trend for Gen Z and millennials - takes its inspiration from the bookish: turtlenecks, fountain pens, satchels and ties.\n\nDriven by Gen Z and millennials, lace will be in, according to the data, including in doily, bandana and makeup form – as will khaki, field jackets and pleated trousers, aka the “paleontologist aesthetic”.\n\nThey’ll also be working an intergalactic “aliencore aesthetic”.\n\nFor Gen Z and millennials, travel will be adrenaline-seeking; for baby boomers, it will be to places that are “mystical” and “ethereal”. Searches for “Faroe Island aesthetic” almost doubled.\n\nPinterest predicts boomer and Gen X food trends to be cruciferous, with kimchi, dumplings and golumpki soup all raising the cabbage’s status. A younger trend for a “gummy bears aesthetic” goes beyond sweets and into makeup products and rubberised nail art.\n\nAnd “niche perfume collection” is having its moment in the sun, as are “perfume layering combinations”.\n\nPinterest said there was a theme uniting trends as disparate as masquerades and operas, dragonfly wing-patterned nails and animal-inspired outfits, forecasting a move towards individuality and away from imitation.\n\nMelinda Petrunoff, the managing director for Pinterest ANZ, told Guardian Australia that “people are craving comfort, authenticity and grounded optimism in a world that feels increasingly fast and often noisy”.\n\n“What’s driving this is a desire for individuality and self-preservation – people are moving towards curating rather than copying, choosing to engage with what truly resonates with them instead of chasing every viral moment,” she said.\n\n“We’re moving away from one-size-fits-all aesthetics and endless trend cycles that leave people feeling overwhelmed and disconnected.”",

    "fullText": "ReScript 12 arrives with a redesigned build toolchain, a modular runtime, and a wave of ergonomic language features.\n\nReScript 12 is now available.\nThis release completes the multi-year effort to separate the compiler from legacy constraints, refreshes critical developer workflows, and delivers a modern feature set that is grounded in real-world feedback.\nThe headline upgrades include a rewritten build system, a standalone runtime package, unified operator support, JSX preserve mode, and numerous syntax improvements that make ReScript code easier to write and maintain.\n\nTeams upgrading from ReScript 11 should review the highlighted breaking changes and schedule time for migration.\nThe new tooling provides focused commands, better diagnostics, and smaller downloads, while the language additions flatten sharp edges that many of you encountered in larger codebases.\n\nYou can find the complete migration guide here.\n\nReScript 12 ships with the new build system introduced earlier this month in the Reforging the Build System preview.\nThe tooling now relies on a modern architecture that tracks dependencies more precisely, avoids unnecessary recompilations, and integrates with incremental workflows even across monorepo packages.\n\nThe new standard library @rescript/core is now included in the compiler runtime. So you can get rid of the dependency on @rescript/core in your projects. To avoid collisions we have named the new internal library just Stdlib, so you can keep using it alongside Core if you cannot migrate yet. There have been tons of additions as well, so you can shrink your Utils files down a bit. Check it out here: Stdlib.\n\nReScript 12 finalizes the unified operator work introduced earlier this year.\nArithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, and the newly added % and **) now work consistently for int, float and bigint, allowing the compiler to infer the correct specialization from the left operand. You can ditch all the +., -., *., and /. now!\n\nIn addition you can also now use + for string concatenation, while ++ still works as before.\n\nReScript now supports F#-style bitwise operators &&& (AND), ||| (OR), ^^^ (XOR), and ~~~ (NOT) for both int and bigint.\nLegacy OCaml-style bitwise functions such as land, lor, and lsl are deprecated.\n\nFor shift operators there was luckily no conflict in the character space, which means ReScript now supports << (logical left shift), >> (logical right shift) and >>> (unsigned right shift), just like JavaScript.\n\nThe language now supports dictionary literals (dict{\"foo\": \"bar\"}) that compile to plain JavaScript objects.\nDict literals work with variables, multi-line formatting, and optional entries, and they drastically reduce the boilerplate compared to Dict.fromArray.\nPattern matching also understands dicts, enabling concise destructuring of JSON payloads and configuration objects.\nThe compiler emits the same optimized JavaScript while preserving ReScript's type guarantees.\n\nNested record definitions remove the need for auxiliary type declarations.\nYou can define optional nested structures directly inside records, or attach record payloads to variant constructors without creating standalone types.\nThe feature supports mutable fields, type parameters, and record spreading, providing better locality for complex domain models with no runtime penalty.\n\nPattern spreads (| ...SomeVariant as value =>) allow you to reuse handlers for entire subsets of constructors.\nWhen a variant extends another variant through spreads, you can match the shared constructors in one branch and delegate to helper functions, keeping exhaustive matches concise even as the hierarchy grows.\nThe compiler enforces subtype relationships and ensures that runtime representations remain compatible.\n\nProjects that rely on downstream JSX tooling can enable preserve mode via \"jsx\": { \"version\": 4, \"preserve\": true }.\nThe compiler will emit JSX syntax directly instead of transforming elements to react/jsx-runtime calls, allowing bundlers such as ESBuild, SWC, or Babel to apply their own transforms.\nThis mode keeps JSX readable in the output and maintains compatibility with React Compiler.\n\nReact classic mode is no longer supported, so projects must use the JSX v4 transform regardless of preserve mode settings.\nWhen preserve mode is disabled, the compiler continues to output the optimized runtime calls you are accustomed to.\n\nThe new @directive attribute emits JavaScript directive strings at the top of generated functions.\nUse it to mark server actions with 'use server', memoized handlers with 'use memo', or any other directive that your framework requires.\nThe attribute works on synchronous and asynchronous functions, supports labeled parameters, and removes the need for %raw blocks.\nCombined with JSX preserve mode, this enables clean integration with React Server Components and other directive-based runtimes.\n\nReScript now understands JavaScript-style regular expression literals (/pattern/flags).\nThey are full equivalents of %re expressions, supporting all ECMAScript flags, Unicode character classes, and sticky searches.\nThe literals compile directly to JavaScript regex objects, so existing APIs like RegExp.exec and RegExp.test continue to work exactly as before, but with clearer syntax and better editor support.\n\nThis release introduces an experimental let? syntax for zero-cost unwrapping of option and result values.\nThe syntax remains behind an opt-in flag while the community evaluates its ergonomics.\nRefer to the forum discussion at https://forum.rescript-lang.org/t/proposing-new-syntax-for-zero-cost-unwrapping-options-results/6227 for the current proposal, examples, and feedback guidelines.\n\nThe printer now emits compact arrow functions and streamlines anonymous function expressions, making generated JavaScript easier to audit.\nThese changes preserve semantics while aligning the output with modern JavaScript style.\n\nThe compiler cleans up its internal abstract syntax tree, removes unused OCaml-era nodes, and tracks async and partial function metadata directly on AST nodes.\nThese changes simplify future feature work and reduce maintenance overhead.\n\nThe rescript npm package declares \"type\": \"module\" and ships ESM code across the CLI.\nImport statements replace CommonJS require usage, improving compatibility with contemporary bundlers and enabling better tree-shaking.\n\nInstaller footprints shrink thanks to platform-specific binary packages such as @rescript/darwin-arm64, @rescript/linux-x64, and @rescript/win32-x64.\nnpm installs only the binary that matches your operating system and architecture, delivering substantially faster installs and smaller cache footprints for CI pipelines.\nThe primary rescript package loads the appropriate binary at runtime and surfaces clear error messages if the matching package is missing.\n\nThe old build system remains available through rescript-legacy, but active projects should switch to the new commands to benefit from faster feedback loops and clearer output.\n\nThe runtime modules were moved from the main rescript npm package to a dedicated @rescript/runtime npm package. It is automatically installed as a dependency of the main rescript package.\nThe new @rescript/runtime package also replaces the standalone runtime package @rescript/std from earlier versions.\n\nAPIs that previously ended with Exn now end with OrThrow.\nExamples include Option.getOrThrow, List.headOrThrow, BigInt.fromStringOrThrow, and JSON.parseOrThrow.\nThe change clarifies that these functions throw JavaScript errors, aligning the naming with the language’s semantics.\nThe deprecated *Exn variants remain available in v12 to ease the transition, and the codemod bundled with the migration tool can perform a mechanical rename.\nNote that Result.getOrThrow now throws a JavaScript exception, so please update any exception-handling logic that relied on OCaml exception names. We also revamped the API around JS exceptions and errors.\n\nWe’ve renamed JS errors to JsError.t to better distinguish them from the Result.Error variant. Since JavaScript allows throwing anything (not only proper Error objects), the previous way of catching JS exceptions was unsafe:\n\nAdditionally, the coexistence of Result.Error and the Error module caused confusion.\n\nThe new recommended pattern is:\n\nUtility helpers for working with JS errors are now in JsError, eg:\n\nJSX v3 has been removed.\nReScript 12 requires JSX v4 configuration in rescript.json, using the \"jsx\": { \"version\": 4 } schema.\nReScript React projects must update their configuration before moving to v12.\nProjects attempting to compile with v3 will receive an explicit error, ensuring that your codebase uses the current transform and associated tooling.\n\nThe standard library continues its shift away from OCaml-specific aliases.\nFunctions such as succ, pred, abs_float, string_of_int, fst, raise, and the char type are now deprecated.\nThe recommended replacements are the JavaScript-aligned counterparts in Int, Float, Bool, Pair, and related modules, alongside the throw keyword for exceptions.\nReferences to the OCaml composition operators (|>, @@) now warn and will be removed in a future version; the ReScript pipe operator -> replaces them.\nThe migration tool highlights deprecated usage, and incremental cleanups are encouraged so your codebase is ready before the next major release.\n\nThank you to every contributor, tester, and partner who helped shape ReScript 12.\nThe core team gathered in Vienna earlier this year to map out this release, and your feedback guided every decision.\nCommunity pull requests, bug reports, and experiments across the ecosystem gave us the confidence to complete large refactors and deprecations.\n\nJoin the conversation on the community forum if you have migration questions or want to share what you build with ReScript 12.\nBusinesses that rely on ReScript can contact the association at https://rescript-association.org/contact to explore support, sponsorship, or collaboration.\nFunding enables the team to ship features like the new runtime architecture faster, so every contribution, financial or otherwise, helps the language move forward.\n\nWe look forward to hearing what you create with ReScript 12.",

    "description": "A blended-wing body aircraft is essentially one giant wing with the cabin built inside. Two California companies are racing Airbus to market.",
    "fullText": "Airbus' CEO said the next generation of commercial aircraft could look like the B-2 bomber.\n\nThe design combines the fuselage and wings into one giant wing with the cabin built inside.\n\nIt promises better fuel burn and passenger space, but it may have few windows.\n\nThe future of aviation could look surprisingly similar to the triangular paper airplanes you folded as a kid.\n\nIn an interview with Tobias Fuchs and Martin Murphy at the German newspaper Bild, Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said that over the next 30 or 40 years, planemakers may abandon the traditional tube-and-wing layout for a single, thick wing with the passenger cabin built inside.\n\nThis design — known as a \"blended-wing body,\" or BWB — distributes lift across the entire sweeping wing, allowing for heavier carrying capacity and greater efficiency than conventional jets. Faury said a widebody aircraft would be \"better suited\" for the concept.\n\nHe added that the BWB benefits come with trade-offs, including the possibility of eliminating windows. Passengers wouldn't receive any natural light, and some could get disoriented or experience claustrophobia.\n\nEmergency evacuations could also be challenging: passengers and crew would have no view of what's going on outside, and those in the cabin center would be farther from exits than on today's jets.\n\nFaury's comments are the latest sign that Airbus sees opportunity in the blended-wing design, an area where it faces competition from new aircraft makers seeking to beat Airbus to market. The BWB design has a long history.\n\nThe Northrop B-2 Spirit stealth bomber — often cited as the best-known \"flying wing\" aircraft — first flew in 1989. Although the BWB concept dates back even further, renewed interest emerged in the early 1990s when McDonnell Douglas explored a blended-wing transport idea that eventually evolved into the BWB-17 in partnership with NASA.\n\nAfter McDonnell Douglas merged with Boeing in 1997, Boeing continued the work with NASA to produce the X-48 series of subscale demonstrators until the program ended in 2013.\n\nBut, to date, no full-size passenger BWB has been certified or flown, and Boeing has not announced plans to develop its own.\n\nFor its part, Airbus has been exploring BWBs since 2017, and the company's 200-person design is a key pillar of its ZEROe initiative for zero-emission aviation.\n\nIn 2019, the company flew a small-scale demonstrator that showed potential major fuel savings — estimated at around 20% — and new cabin layouts made possible by the wider interior. The long-term vision includes running these aircraft on hydrogen rather than traditional jet fuel.",

    "description": "The An-22 that crashed was reportedly the last airworthy example of what was once the world’s heaviest aircraft.",
    "fullText": "A Russian military Antonov An-22 Cock heavy transport aircraft crashed in the Ivanovo region, around 125 miles northeast of Moscow today, killing the entire crew. The incident is notable especially for the fact that the Soviet-era plane had been widely reported as retired, roughly 18 months ago. Exactly why the aircraft was still flying is unclear, but it does raise some questions about the overall status of the Russian Aerospace Forces’ transport arm.\n\nAccording to the Investigative Committee of Russia, the country’s main federal investigating authority, the turboprop-powered airlifter went down near the village of Ivankovo. Eyewitnesses reported seeing the An-22 breaking apart in mid-air, with parts of the fuselage falling into a reservoir near the village. A video posted to social media purportedly shows a salvage team removing fragments of the aircraft from the Uvodskoye Reservoir.\n\nThe Investigative Committee of Russia has so far not disclosed how many people were on board, although the state-run TASS news agency puts the number at seven, and unconfirmed reports on social media provide names for each.\n\nRussian state media quoted the Russian Ministry of Defense as saying that the An-22 was undergoing a test flight “following repairs” when it crashed, suggesting it was in the process of being returned to service.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense confirmed that search crews were deployed to the crash site and an investigation was opened into the accident.\n\nCiting anonymous sources, the Kommersant business newspaper reported that the accident was likely caused by a technical malfunction.\n\nBack in August of last year, there were unconfirmed reports that Russia had finally ceased operations of its An-22 fleet altogether. At this time, it was suggested that the last example, registration number RF-09309, built in 1974, was flown from its home base of Migalovo in the Tver region of western Russia, to Yekaterinburg in the Ural Federal District on August 16, 2024. It was expected to be put on permanent display at the military museum in Verkhnyaya Pyshma. However, no An-22 is visible in recent satellite imagery of the collection, suggesting those plans may have changed.\n\nFrom August 16. \n\nFinal flight of Antei RF-09309 #14245D. Russia is retiring their An-22s. This one is slated to become part of a museum. \n\nPic by Artyom Kuzhlev pic.twitter.com/nvbO3BQjGZ\n\n— Evergreen Intel (@vcdgf555) August 24, 2024\n\nPotentially, RF-09309 is the same aircraft that crashed today, or it could have been one of the other four An-22s that were reportedly still active with the Russian Aerospace Forces’ 196th Military Transport Aviation Regiment as of June 2024.\n\nAt that point, Gen. Vladimir Venediktov, the commander of Military Transport Aviation, told Russia’s state-owned VGTRK broadcaster that the An-22 was headed for retirement before the end of that year.\n\nThat the An-22 survived that long, let alone that an example was still flying as of today, is somewhat remarkable.\n\nAs you can read about in detail here, the An-22 was designed and built by the Antonov company based in Kyiv, in what was then the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. The prototype flew on February 27, 1965, at which point it was the world’s heaviest aircraft.\n\nIn common with the Tupolev Tu-95 Bear bomber, the An-22 was powered by four huge Kuznetsov NK-12MA turboprops, each rated at more than 14,805 horsepower and driving eight-blade contra-rotating propellers, more than 20 feet in diameter.\n\nThe powerplant gave the An-22 a distinctive mechanical roar, as heard in the video below.\n\nIn all, 68 An-22s were completed, including two prototypes, between 1966 and 1976.\n\nService entry with the Soviet military was in January 1969, and the aircraft was especially valued for its ability to accommodate outsized loads.\n\nUp to more than 132,000 pounds of cargo could be carried. Alternatively, the An-22’s cargo hold had space for 151 paratroopers or 292 standard troops, carried on two decks. However, the main cargo hold was not pressurized, except for a forward cabin with seating for 29 personnel.\n\nItems of cargo included complete missile systems, as well as large and heavy military vehicles, via the large loading ramp at the rear. The aircraft could also operate from austere airfields if required.\n\nHowever, the Russian military chose to keep the An-22, even in limited numbers, since it was cheaper to operate than the An-124, but had a much bigger hold than the Ilyushin Il-76 Candid.\n\nPlans to modernize the surviving An-22s failed, however, with the result that the active Russian Aerospace Forces’ fleet dwindled to five.\n\nA sixth was still operated by the Antonov Design Bureau in Kyiv until it was reportedly damaged beyond repair during fighting at Hostomel Airport at the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion.\n\nThe fact that at least one An-22 was apparently being prepared to return to active service with the Russian Aerospace Forces appears to paint a bleak picture of its air transport arm.\n\nWhile it still operates significant numbers of Il-76s, in terms of heavy transports, Russia has also failed to reinstate production of the An-124. The main problem has been a lack of suitable engines — the original D-18T turbofan is manufactured by Motor Sich at its plant in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine. Meanwhile, Motor Sich is also the only company capable of overhauling these engines, reducing the availability of the Russian An-124 fleet. This factor also may have driven the An-22’s planned return to service.\n\nPlans to develop an all-new, all-Russian successor to the Ukrainian-designed An-124 have so far also failed to materialize.\n\nOverall, the Russian transport aircraft fleet is aging fast, and this may also have contributed to other recent accidents.\n\nIn July of this year, a civilian-operated Antonov An-24 Coke twin-turboprop regional airliner crashed near Tynda in the Amur region of eastern Russia. All 42 passengers and six crew members on board died. The aircraft, long obsolete, had been manufactured in 1976.\n\nIn the same month, two people were killed after an An-2 Colt utility transport crashed in southern Russia’s Krasnodar region. The An-2 was first flown in 1947, and the Soviet Union and Russia have collectively failed to develop a suitable successor for a type that remains in widespread use.\n\nThere have also been other Russian transport aircraft losses that may or may not be connected to the conflict in Ukraine, as well as pinpoint attacks on these aircraft by long-range Ukrainian drone strikes.\n\nAt the same time, the fleet, in general, is likely suffering from the effects of sanctions, especially when it comes to readiness levels.\n\nWith the war in Ukraine still raging, the Russian military’s demand for heavy-lift air transport is only going to continue. Whatever the reason for today’s crash, it is a blow to the Russian Aerospace Forces. Apart from the slim possibility that a contractor might try and obtain the remaining aircraft to exploit their unique capabilities, it seems altogether unlikely that the An-22 will find a way back into regular service after this latest incident.\n\nContact the author: thomas@thewarzone.com",

    "description": "The Fed's final meeting of 2025 is expected to see a third interest rate cut from the central bank, with investors focusing on the outlook for 2026.",
    "fullText": "The Federal Reserve's final meeting of the year began on Tuesday morning, Dec. 9, and the central bank is scheduled to announce its final monetary policy decision at 2:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nInvestors expect the Fed will cut rates by 0.25%, its third cut of the year, at the conclusion of its two-day meeting, with data from the CME Group showing an 87% chance the central bank will cut rates this week.\n\nAlong with its final policy decision of the year, the Fed will also publish its final Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) for 2025, which includes forecasts from Fed officials on economic growth, inflation, and interest rates for the coming years.\n\nIn September, the SEP showed the Fed's median forecasts calling for just one interest rate cut in 2026 following three reductions in 2025. Changes to this outlook will be top of mind for investors on Wednesday.\n\nInvestors will also be closely watching for further disagreement among Fed officials, as October's policy statement revealed two members of the FOMC voted against the decision to lower rates by 0.25%.\n\nIn today's Morning Brief newsletter, Yahoo Finance's Hamza Shaban asks: Why are bond yields rising as the Fed cuts rates?\n\nYahoo Finance's Ivana Pino reports:\n\nGlobal bond yields have risen to highs not seen since 2009 ahead of a key Federal Reserve policy meeting. A sign concerns are growing that interest-rate cutting cycles from the US may soon be coming to an end.\n\nShould the Federal Reserve lower interest rates this week, the effects are likely to ripple out to interest-earning accounts. Here's what you need to know about how the federal funds rate impacts certificates of deposit (CDs).\n\nYahoo Finance's Ivana Pino reports:\n\nMany prospective homebuyers may be wondering, \"When will mortgage rates go back down to 3%?\" The quick answer, according to Yahoo Finance's Hal Bundrick, is that it's not likely anytime soon.\n\nUS stocks were little changed at Tuesday's close as traders bet that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to CME Group's FedWatch tool, traders assigned a 87.6% probability to the Fed cutting rates by 25 basis points, down marginally from odds placed on a cut a day ago.\n\nAlthough stocks were muted in the lead-up to the Fed decision, one strategist noted that Chair Jerome Powell's comments at the press conference will likely affect market sentiment heading into 2026.\n\n“A 25 basis point cut is important for investor sentiment, not necessarily for many of the companies that we invest in,\" Siebert Financial chief investment officer Mark Malek told Yahoo Finance about how the Fed decision could affect investments. \"This 25 basis points is not going to make or break a lot of these companies.\"\n\nBarring a major deterioration in the labor market, Malek expects the Fed to try to temper expectations for further rate cuts. That's why Powell's remarks on the labor market will be especially scrutinized, he said.\n\n\"It is important that the Fed is showing that they're concerned about the labor market,\" Malek said. \"It's good for the consumer to know that the Fed's got their backs, if people are worried about their jobs, or maybe they're going to pull back on spending after the holiday season.\"\n\nThe Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower short-term interest rates on Wednesday for the third time this year, affecting the interest consumers pay and receive on many of their accounts.\n\nYahoo Finance's Hal Bundrick breaks down how discounts to the federal funds rate will impact deposits, credit, and debt:\n\n2025 has been a year of modest earnings on deposit accounts. Another rate cut won't help.\n\nThe national average of interest paid on checking accounts has barely budged much this year and remains at 0.07%. Interest rates on savings accounts are only marginally better, remaining at 0.40%.\n\nImagine that moving even lower. Is it possible? Yes.\n\nStock prices often react to the Fed’s rate actions, but they are only one factor among many affecting the investing climate and stock prices.\n\nIf you intend to manage your investments to suit the current environment, keep watch on broader economic and corporate profit trends alongside interest rates. If you prefer to stay conservative, fill your portfolio with high-quality stocks that have proven themselves in all economic cycles.\n\nThen, wait patiently for long-term growth.\n\nRead more about how the Fed affects your money here.\n\nAs markets look ahead to the path of Federal Reserve policy in 2026, President Trump offered one clue in an interview with Politico released Tuesday.\n\nTrump responded “yes” when asked if quickly reducing interest rates would be a litmus test for his choice of central bank leader. Trump has a list of five candidates to replace current Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whose term expires in May 2026.\n\n“Yes. Well, this guy ... should too,” Trump said, referring to Powell. “I think he’s a combination of not a smart person and doesn’t like Trump.”\n\nStocks were muted at the market open on Tuesday after a Federal Reserve spokesperson confirmed the FOMC meeting was underway.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was flat and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.2%. All three indexes came off modest losses on Monday.\n\nTreasury yields steadied as investors awaited the release of jobs data and the Federal Open Market Committee's policy decision.\n\nThe benchmark 10-year yield (^TNX) fell 2 basis points to 4.14%. Meanwhile, the 30-year yield (^TYX) declined 3 basis points to 4.78% after hitting its highest level in about three months on Monday.\n\nRead more about today's market action here.\n\nThe consensus around the Federal Reserve’s policy move on Wednesday has firmed around a 25 basis point rate cut — even if the decision will be a close one, as Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger details.\n\nTraders are pricing in an 89% chance that the Fed lowers interest rates by 25 basis points at the conclusion of the FOMC meeting on Wednesday, according to CMEGroup's FedWatch.\n\nBut looking ahead to the January meeting and 2026 broadly, the path is even less certain.\n\nOne widely held view is that the Fed will move forward with a \"hawkish cut\" on Wednesday, in which the central bank lowers rates but hints at a pause in January, JPMorgan’s Michael Feroli wrote in a Dec. 5 note. Traders have put a 23% probability that the Federal Reserve will continue cutting rates at its Jan. 27-28 meeting.\n\n“At the press conference, we expect that Powell will stress that with policy rates close to neutral, the time for risk management cuts is past and that further cuts would only come with a material deterioration in the labor market,” Feroli wrote.\n\n\"We don’t expect him to comment directly on January,\" Feroli added, \"but instead to highlight that there is a lot of data to be released between now and the January meeting and that will guide their decision.\"\n\nFor the remainder of the year, views range from the Fed cutting rates at its next few policy meetings due to a deterioration in the labor market to additional rate cuts in the summer due to a change in Fed leadership.\n\nRead more about 2026 predictions for Federal Reserve policy here.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's eventful 2025 wraps up this week, and another 0.25% rate cut is expected.\n\nBut the real drama in the central bank's release will be in how much agreement, or not, there is with this decision.\n\nAs Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger noted in her preview of the event, at least three regional Fed presidents have signaled that the case for cutting rates this week does not appear obvious. One of those includes Kansas City Fed president Jeff Schmid, who voted against October's rate cut.\n\nAdd in that Fed Governor Stephen Miran has twice dissented in favor of a larger rate cut, the central bank could be looking at upward of four votes against the expected decision to lower rates by another 0.25% on Wednesday.\n\nRead Jennifer's full preview of the meeting here.",

    "title": "Scientists Discovered the Truth About 16 Mysterious Pits Near Stonehenge",
    "description": "What was going on 4,500 years ago in Britain?",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nAn arc of 16 massive pits found near Stonehenge were confirmed as manmade structures.\n\nUsing a range of scientific methods, archaeologists from multiple institutions dated the pits to the Neolithic period around 2480 B.C.E.\n\nThe pits, located around the Durrington Walls henge, were part of a larger monumental site and culture of the area.\n\nThe 16 uniformly shaped massive pits found at the Neolithic Durrington Walls henge just north of Stonehenge were not a random natural occurrence. Ever since their discovery in 2020, research teams from a range of institutions have studied the site, and the conclusion is clear: The pits were manmade, likely all dug around the same time in 2480 B.C.E.\n\n“The recent work confirms that the circle of shafts surrounding Durrington Walls is without precedent within the UK,” Vince Gaffney, professor and lead archaeologist from the University of Bradford, said in a statement from the school. “These features were not simply dug and abandoned—they were part of a structured, monumental landscape that speaks to the complexity and sophistication of Neolithic society.”\n\nThe team’s findings were detailed in a study published by Internet Archaeology, showing just how this structure, the largest of its type ever found in Britain, likely came to be. The 16 pits form a circle over 1.25 miles wide at Durrington Walls, itself one of the largest prehistoric enclosures in Britain, enclosing an area greater than one square mile. Many of the pits are nearly 33 feet in diameter and up to 16 feet deep.\n\nUsing borehole coring, sediment analysis, geochemistry, optically stimulated luminescence dating, and environmental DNA the team confirmed the pits were human-dug and dated to the Late Neolithic period, around the same time Durrington Walls was constructed.\n\n“The new dating evidence, coupled with the remarkably consistent geochemical signature seen within the fills at the pits provides definitive evidence that they were constructed by people living at the site over a very short time period,” Tim Kinnaird of the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences Dating Laboratory at the University of St Andrews, said in a statement from the university. “The synchronous timing of this could only have been achieved by a dedicated and coordinated action.”\n\nData on the two arcs around the site show that the pits were a cohesive structure, likely representing an elaboration of the Durrington Walls monument complex at a “massive and completely unexpected scale.”\n\n“The skill and effort that must have been required not only to dig the pits, but also to place them so precisely within the landscape is a marvel,” Richard Bates, professor at St Andrews, said in a statement. “When you consider that the pits are spread over such a large distance, the fact they are located in a near perfect circular pattern is quite remarkable.”\n\nArchaeologists believe the pits may have marked a sacred boundary linked to ceremonial activity at Durrington Walls, like what happened at Stonehenge. The fine clay-silt layers now found in the pits suggest gradual infilling over time.\n\n“It is rare to have the opportunity to apply so many geophysical and geochemical techniques together to investigate a site,” Bates said, “but demonstrates the power of doing so when you do.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

American aid is essentially what won the war. Britain would never have been defeated, but Britain wouldn't have ever gone on any meaningful offensive without American aid and support. The USSR needed American aid to survive. Whilst the USSR did the heavy lifting in terms of casualties, it was the Western Allies who destroyed the means of German production.

    "title": "Sources: University of Utah nearing landmark private equity deal expected to generate $500 million",
    "description": "The new venture would generate a massive amount of money for the school in a groundbreaking move that may pave the way for more schools and conferences to do the same.",
    "fullText": "Private equity has officially arrived in college athletics.\n\nThe University of Utah is on the cusp of striking the industry’s first partnership with an equity firm in a marriage that features a nine-figure capital infusion and the creation and shared ownership of a for-profit entity to operate athletics business and financial elements outside of the traditional university framework.\n\nThe new venture is expected to generate as much or more than $500 million in capital — a groundbreaking and innovative move that may pave the way for more schools and conferences to pursue such a concept.\n\nFinalization of the project is expected soon pending authorization on Tuesday from the University of Utah Board of Trustees. The board is granting the university permission to move forward with the agreement with Otro Capital, a New York-based sports private equity firm.\n\nMultiple officials with knowledge of the project spoke to Yahoo Sports under condition of anonymity.\n\nThe endeavor with Otro Capital is more than just a nine-figure infusion of cash.\n\nAt the center of the project is the creation of a private, independent offshoot of the athletic department — Utah Brands & Entertainment LLC — in a first-of-its-kind partnership between a university athletic department and an equity partner. An executive team from Otro Capital, combined with athletics department personnel, will lead the creation and operation of the new company, which will live within the university’s foundation.\n\nThe university retains majority ownership and decision-making authority of Utah Brands & Entertainment. Otro marries the capital infusion with a team of experienced operators. A president from outside the university will preside over the company and report to a board, chaired by Utah athletic director Mark Harlan, with seats for trustees and Otro executives.\n\nThe project includes a fascinating wrinkle. The university is offering a prominent group of donors the ability to purchase a stake in Utah Brands & Entertainment. Already, university officials have culled a small donor base to generate millions in purchase agreements. The more than $500 million capital figure includes both the nine-figure cash infusion from Otro as well as those capital commitments from donors.\n\nUtah Brands & Entertainment will house most of the components traditionally held within the university’s athletic department, including many athletic personnel and divisions. However, fundraising will remain with the school.\n\nThe new company’s primary goal is to generate more revenue across an assortment of areas, including ticketing, concessions, corporate sales and sponsorships. Charged with overseeing and operating the revenue-share pay system for Utah athletes, the new entity provides the department with more flexibility and freedom considering it will operate separate from a public university.\n\nThe move isn’t completely foreign to college sports. Over the last several months, a host of schools — Kentucky, Michigan State, Clemson — have announced the creation of a private, revenue-generating entity outside of the athletic department as college sports evolves into a more professionalized ecosystem. None of those schools have partnered with an equity firm. However, Michigan State announced its own capital infusion of sorts in the form of a $401 million donation, a portion of which will go toward its new athletics entity.\n\nAs for Utah’s partnership, in exchange for the upfront cash, Otro will earn a large percentage of annual revenues generated from Utah Brands & Entertainment as it splits funds with the university. An exit strategy — in five to seven years — exists, and the university holds the right to purchase Otro’s ownership stake.\n\nThe emergence of private equity in college sports is a long time coming.\n\nFor the last two years, as university athletic departments face mounting financial stressors, dozens of schools pursued private capital or equity deals, including conferences as a whole — most notably the Big 12 and Big Ten. However, when these projects reached the finish line, they were stymied for various reasons.\n\nFor instance, Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark has twice presented such a deal before his presidential board. Big Ten officials nearly reached the point of a vote on a $2.4 billion capital deal before at least two schools — USC and Michigan — scuttled the project.\n\nYormark’s pursuit of a capital deal caught the attention of Harlan and Utah administrators, who, more than two years ago, began the process that resulted in the potential deal with Otro.\n\nAccording to its website, Otro seeks to invest in “sports teams, leagues and ecosystem businesses with strong intellectual property.” The company was founded in 2023 by partners Alec Scheiner, Niraj Shah, Brent Stehlik and Isaac Halyard, who all served as senior executives at RedBird Capital Partners, one of the globe’s largest sports industry investors.\n\nScheiner has a deep background as a sports investor and team executive, spending time as president of the Cleveland Browns and senior vice president of the Dallas Cowboys. He was the point man for Legends Hospitality, a corporation providing food, merchandise, retail and stadium operations for venues and companies worldwide. Stehlik was the previous president of OneTeam Partners and worked as a chief revenue officer for the Browns.\n\nOtro’s portfolio includes the Formula 1 Alpine Racing team, FlexWork Sports marketing and event company and Two Circles, a fan and data analytics platform. Otro will own a large share — but not a majority share — of Utah Brands & Entertainment, similar to its other projects. For instance, Otro invested $200 million in Alpine Racing to own a 24% equity stake.\n\nAccording to a 2024 story on buyoutinsider.com, Otro was targeting $500 million for a sports-focused investment fund. The company has pitched its college plan to other schools — one specifically in the Big Ten — before Utah expressed serious interest.\n\nIt’s unclear if Otro has plans to execute similar agreements with other schools.\n\nIn Salt Lake City, Otro executives, charged with revenue-generating goals, will have access to the school’s trademark and licensing rights, facilities, sponsorships and the university’s teams. However, decisions around coaching staff and player acquisition remain with university personnel.\n\nIn fact, the school cleared the partnership with NCAA officials. To remain under the NCAA’s umbrella, Utah’s university president and athletic director must retain the majority of decision-making.",

    "fullText": "Katie Miller lavished Elon Musk with praise during a fawning interview with the billionaire businessman in which she described how “inspirational” it was to work for him.\n\nThe podcast host, who previously worked at the White House with her husband, Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, quit the administration in May to go into the private sector and work directly for Musk.\n\nOn the latest episode of The Katie Miller Podcast, the unusually animated host gushed over her previous boss months after unconfirmed rumors of a relationship between the pair outside the workplace.\n\n“Everyone always thinks you’re a very difficult person to work for,” Miller said, before adding, “I think you’re very kind,” prompting Musk to thank her for the compliment.\n\n“People think, which you are, like, a very demanding boss,” Miller continued. “I’ve never heard you yell at any employee,” she said.\n\n“Yeah, I don’t yell,” Musk replied.\n\nMiller worked as a spokesperson for Musk as he oversaw the so-called Department of Government Efficiency between January and May this year, before leaving with him to work for the billionaire personally, prior to launching her podcast.\n\nThe podcast love-in continued with Miller telling Musk that “every employee who works at every single one of your companies is incredibly mission-driven,” noting that fact was “unlike any other workplace I’ve seen.”\n\nShe went on to single out Musk’s Starbase compound in South Texas, which was created around SpaceX’s rocket development and launch site.\n\n“Like Starbase is the most inspirational place you’ll ever go to, right?” Miller said, before claiming that all his employees are “fiercely loyal.”\n\nShe added, “You are a very good employer to work for and I think people assume you are not.”\n\n“Well, why would they think anyone would work at the companies?” Musk pondered out loud.\n\n“Talented people can go work anywhere they want... if they’re mistreated in some way, they would leave and go work somewhere else.”\n\nMiller’s podcast has struggled to find an audience after three months. Her first interview, with Vice President JD Vance, remains the most popular on YouTube with 85,000 views. Her lowest-viewed episode has been viewed a dismal 2,700 times.\n\nThe Musk interview has already scored more views in six hours than last week’s episode with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and his third wife, Jen, has clocked up in an entire week.\n\nWhen news of Miller’s resignation from her husband’s place of work first emerged, the Democrats taunted Trump’s deputy chief of staff with an image of an empty chair in a hotel room, appearing to suggest there was trouble in the marriage.\n\n.@StephenM: https://t.co/IjFdietRgU pic.twitter.com/ndcIsPHWFd\n\n— Democrats (@TheDemocrats) May 30, 2025\n\nDuring the podcast, the pair avoided discussion of a mishap in June on Musk’s social media platform, X, where a fake screenshot of Musk bragging that he “took” Miller’s wife went viral online, forcing the billionaire to correct his own AI assistant, Grok.\n\nThe AI assistant claimed, “The post from Elon Musk likely existed and was deleted,” noting that the “metrics and context align with Musk’s behavior.”\n\n“The evidence leans toward the post being real but removed, consistent with Musk’s pattern of deleting controversial posts.”\n\nMusk then intervened, replying “No, it’s fake ffs… I never posted this.” Miller never directly commented on the whispers.",

    "fullText": "BOSTON (AP) — A federal judge has allowed a Tufts University student from Turkey to resume research and teaching while she deals with the consequences of having her visa revoked by the Trump administration, leading to six weeks of detention.\n\nThe arrest of Rümeysa Öztürk, a PhD student studying children's relationship to social media, was among the first as the Trump administration began targeting foreign-born students and activists involved in pro-Palestinian advocacy. She had co-authored an op-ed criticizing her university’s response to Israel and the war in Gaza. Caught on video in March outside her Somerville residence, immigration enforcement officers took her away in an unmarked vehicle.\n\nÖztürk has been out of a Louisiana immigrant detention center since May and back on the Tufts campus. But she's been unable to teach or participate in research as part of her studies because of the termination of her record in the government's database of foreign students studying temporarily in the U.S.\n\nIn her ruling Monday, Chief U.S. District Judge Denise J. Casper wrote that Öztürk is likely to succeed on claims that the termination was “arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law and in violation of the First Amendment.”\n\nGovernment argued that termination was legal\n\nThe government’s lawyers unsuccessfully argued that the Boston federal court lacked jurisdiction and that Öztürk’s Student and Exchange Visitor Information System record (SEVIS) record was terminated legally after her visa was revoked, making her eligible for removal proceedings.\n\n“There’s no statute or regulation that’s been violated by the termination of the SEVIS record in this case,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Sauter said during a hearing last week. The Associated Press sent an email Tuesday seeking comment from Sauter on whether the government plans to appeal.\n\nIn a statement, Öztürk, who plans to graduate next year, said while she is grateful for the court's decision, she feels “a great deal of grief” for the education she has been “arbitrarily denied as a scholar and a woman in my final year of doctoral studies.”\n\n“I hope one day we can create a world where everyone uses education to learn, connect, civically engage and benefit others — rather than criminalize and punish those whose opinions differ from our own,” said Öztürk, who is still challenging her arrest and detention.\n\nThe then-30-year-old was one of four students who wrote the opinion piece in the campus newspaper. It criticized the university’s response to student activists demanding that Tufts “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide,” disclose its investments and divest from companies with ties to Israel.\n\nÖztürk, who is Muslim, was meeting friends in March for iftar, a meal that breaks a fast at sunset during Ramadan, according to her lawyer, Mahsa Khanbabai. Her student visa had been revoked several days earlier, but she was not informed of that, her lawyers said. The government asserted that terminating her SEVIS record two hours after her arrest was a proper way of informing Tufts University about her visa revocation.\n\nA State Department memo said Öztürk's visa was revoked following an assessment that her actions “‘may undermine U.S. foreign policy by creating a hostile environment for Jewish students and indicating support for a designated terrorist organization’ including co-authoring an op-ed that found common cause with an organization that was later temporarily banned from campus.”\n\nÖztürk running out of time to pursue teaching, research goals\n\nWithout her SEVIS status reinstated, Öztürk said she couldn't qualify as a paid research assistant and couldn't fully reintegrate into academic life at Tufts.\n\n“We have a strange kind of legal gaslighting here, where the government claims it’s just a tinkering in a database, but this is really something that has a daily impact on Ms. Öztürk’s life,” her attorney, Adriana Lafaille of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, said in court.\n\n“We are running out of time to make this right. Each day that goes by is a day that she is being prevented from doing the work that she loves in the graduate program that she came here to be part of. Each day that this happens is a day that the government is allowed to continue to punish her for her protected speech.”\n\nÖztürk, meanwhile, has maintained a full course load and fulfilled all requirements to maintain her lawful student status, which the government hasn't terminated, her lawyer said.\n\nRecord created to collect information on international students\n\nSEVIS is mandated by Congress in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 and administered by the director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement “to collect information relating to nonimmigrant foreign students” and “use such information to carry out the enforcement functions of” ICE.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, when a SEVIS record is terminated, a student loses all on and/ or off-campus employment authorization and allows ICE agents to investigate to “confirm the departure of the student.”\n\nMcCormack reported from Concord, New Hampshire.",

    "fullText": "The National Weather Service (NWS) has issued winter weather warnings for Tuesday, Dec. 9, for a range of states, with areas across the U.S. getting anywhere from 1-3 inches of snow to up to 24 inches.\n\nThe winter storm warnings and advisories say that 14 states across the country are in line to get several inches of snow from Tuesday, Dec. 9, early morning into Wednesday, Dec. 10, resulting in hazardous travel.\n\nAccording to research from the National Weather Service, the accumulating snow results from two different winter storm systems. The heaviest snow stretches from the Northern Plains states, Upper Great Lakes, Midwest, mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Even though two different story systems are causing the heavy snow, areas under both systems are experiencing similar conditions.\n\nThe NWS has issued winter storm warnings and winter weather advisories for North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Montana, Wyoming, Vermont, New Hampshire, Michigan, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York and Maine.\n\nAn interactive map from the NWS shows that Montana and Wyoming are expected to get an upwards of 24 inches of snow. New York is slated to get up to 12 inches; Wisconsin and North Dakota an upwards of seven inches; Minnesota, Michigan and Pennsylvania up to six inches; and West Virginia, Virginia and Maryland up to three inches.\n\nMeteorologists have also warned of a polar vortex making its way across the U.S. this week bringing record-breaking cold temperatures. So, snow on top of those cold temperatures will make roads even more hazardous.\n\n\"The polar vortex is defined as the dominant meteorological system in the winter stratosphere and mesosphere, characterized by a circumpolar west-to-east jet stream that balances extremely cold air over the winter pole with warmer midlatitude air,\" Science Direct notes.\n\nWhile the snow is expected to lighten up towards the end of the week, that's not true for the cold. Areas of the Northeast and mid-Atlantic are expected to see their coldest temperatures this weekend, according to research from the NWS.\n\nA winter weather warning, according to the NWS, \"indicates that heavy snow of at least six inches in 12 hours, or at least 8 inches in 24 hours, is expected. It can also be issued if sleet accumulation will be at least half an inch. \"\n\nIn contrast, a blizzard warning means \"blizzard conditions (low visibility of less than 1/4 mile due to falling and/or blowing snow, and winds at least 35 mph) are expected for at least three hours.\"\n\nA winter weather advisory is issued for one or more of the following, according to the NWS: \"Snow of 3 to 5 inches in 12 hours, sleet accumulation up to 1/4 inch, freezing rain in combination with sleet and/or snow, or blowing snow.\"",

    "fullText": "BRUSSELS (AP) — Almost four years into Russia’s full-scale war on Ukraine, European Union leaders have committed to funding Kyiv’s economic and military needs for the next two years, one way or another. Ukraine is desperate and needs the money by early 2026.\n\nAt a summit next week, the 27 EU leaders will weigh whether to use tens of billions of dollars in frozen Russian assets held in Europe to help meet Ukraine’s requirements, which the International Monetary Fund puts at 135 billion euros ($157 billion).\n\nSuch a move has never been done before, and it comes with risks. The European Central Bank has warned that if Europeans appear willing to grab other countries' money, it could undermine confidence in the euro currency. Some member nations are also concerned about inviting retaliation from Russia.\n\nBelgium, where most of the assets are held, is the main opponent of the plan. It’s fearful that Russia will strike back, either through the courts or in more nefarious ways. A series of drone incidents near airports and military bases last month suggested that the Kremlin was already doing so, but those responsible were never publicly identified.\n\nEuropean Council President Antonio Costa, who will chair the Dec. 18 summit, has insisted that the leaders should not leave EU headquarters in Brussels until they have reached a decision.\n\nEU leaders froze the money, most of it in Russian Central Bank assets, over the war that Putin launched in February 2022. Moscow has described the scheme as “theft.”\n\nTwo plans have emerged. The first would be a “reparations loan” that would use the Russian assets until Moscow agrees to pay for the damage inflicted on Ukraine. Few think Russian President Vladimir Putin will ever agree to pay reparations.\n\nPlan B would be for the EU to borrow the money on financial markets, much as the bloc did to fund a massive loan plan to revive European economies after the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMany of Europe’s major economies are cash strapped and mired in debt. But Russia’s war on Ukraine poses an existential threat to the bloc. Intelligence assessments suggest that Putin could launch a war elsewhere in three to five years should he defeat Ukraine.\n\nThe assets make up a substantial pot of potentially ready-to-use cash.\n\nThe European Commission, the EU’s executive branch, estimates that 210 billion ($244 billion) euros worth of frozen assets are currently held in Europe. The vast majority — around 193 billion euros ($225 billion) at the end of September — are held in the Belgian financial clearinghouse known as Euroclear.\n\nThere are political advantages too. Should the EU choose to use the assets, only “a qualified majority” of countries — around a two-thirds majority — would be required for a green light. Borrowing on financial markets would have to be endorsed by all, meaning that even a single no vote would sink the idea.\n\nOver the last year, Hungary has blocked EU support for Ukraine at almost every turn. The government in Slovakia is starting to dig in its heels as well. A new and stridently nationalist leader in the Czech Republic could further complicate the decision.\n\nAvoiding a veto is in the interest of the vast majority of member countries.\n\nDetails of the reparations loan\n\nUnveiling her plan on Dec. 4, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU would cover two-thirds of Ukraine’s needs for 2026 and 2027, for a total of 90 billion euros ($105 billion). International partners would fill the gap.\n\nDue to EU sanctions on Russia’s assets, cash balances have accumulated at Euroclear. They’ve generated interest — some 3.9 billion euros ($4.5 billion) this year, Euroclear says — which is already being used to fund a Group of Seven loan plan for Ukraine.\n\nUnder the new plan, some of the cash would be transferred to an EU debt instrument. Ukraine would owe the EU the money but would repay only after the bloc’s sanctions are lifted and after Russia agrees to pay war reparations.\n\nThe commission insists that there is no “theft,” as Russia has claimed, because the right of the Russian Central Bank to make a claim on its money and Euroclear’s duty to repay will remain intact.\n\nOnce Putin pays war reparations, Ukraine would repay the EU, the EU would repay Euroclear, and Euroclear would repay the Russian Central Bank.\n\nImportantly for Belgium, the plan contains safeguards to ensure that the risks would be shared by its partners. Other EU countries would offer to guarantee the loan if something went wrong. Germany has already signaled that it would do so.\n\nBut the Belgian government has not been assuaged. Even before the commission's reparations loan plan was made public, Foreign Minister Maxime Prévot said that it “entails consequential economic, financial and legal risks.”\n\nPrévot said Belgium — a strong backer of Ukraine that has provided military and financial support — feels that its concerns are not being heard by its EU partners.\n\n“We are not seeking to antagonize our partners or Ukraine. We are simply seeking to avoid potential disastrous consequences for a member state that is being asked to show solidarity without being offered the same solidarity in return,” he said.\n\nIn an interview with Belgian public broadcaster RTBF last week, Euroclear CEO Valerie Urbain also said that court action could not be ruled out should the EU oblige the clearinghouse to transfer its Russian assets.",

    "fullText": "Construction soon will start on what will become Oklahoma’s longest bridge, at least for a little while.\n\nThe Oklahoma Turnpike Authority Board on Tuesday, Dec. 9, awarded $97 million to construct the first project for the East-West Connector Turnpike, which is part of the agency’s $8.2 billion, 15-year ACCESS Oklahoma program. The bridge will connect Interstates 44 and 35, running between Portland Avenue and Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nCrossland Construction was awarded the project. Darian Butler, director of engineering for OTA, said the bid is about 30% below the engineer’s estimate.\n\nJoe Echelle, executive director of the OTA, said connecting the area just east of Newcastle to Moore and Norman was a critical path project. He anticipates work on the bridge to start in early 2026 and be completed in late 2027.\n\nThe bridge will span the Canadian River, but Echelle said it was designed to minimize environmental impact, in addition to protecting water quality and the habitat of threatened species.\n\n“The bridge piers will be constructed outside of the river channel, and OTA will monitor construction very closely to ensure the contractor complies with all environmental safeguards,” Echelle said.\n\nOnce constructed, it will be the longest bridge in the state at more than 1.25 miles. However Echelle said the Oklahoma Department of Transportation has “plans on the shelf” for a project that will have a longer one.\n\nMore: Dozens of crashes keep happening on one part of Turner Turnpike. What's being done?\n\nThe board also approved a Resolution of Necessity for the condemnation of three properties along the East-West Connector and Turner turnpikes. A resolution of necessity gives the board’s approval to move forward with condemnation on a property, but only if necessary, according to the state website.\n\nOTA Transportation Manager Todd Gore said negotiations with a property along the East-West Connector have been unsuccessful with the landowners.\n\n“This does not mean you stop negotiating, but this is kind of at an impasse,” Gore said. “We’ve been trying to get a counteroffer, and we have not been able to receive that from them, and we’ve been working over the last month to try and get that.”\n\nThe second and third parcels in the path of a Turner Turnpike project were brought before the board on Tuesday due to title issues.\n\n“We’re working with the landowner to try and get their documentation secure, but they’re unable to find that documentation to clear the title to get through the closing company, so that’s why we are requesting condemnation on that,\" Gore said.\n\nAll three properties are currently vacant, according to the agency.\n\nThe agency reports 81 total property acquisition agreements to date across the ACCESS Oklahoma program, including parcels on the Will Rogers, East-West Connector and State Highway 375/Indian Nation turnpikes. Additionally, 28 properties have been approved for the resolution of necessity for possible condemnation action, and 13 of the 28 are being prepared for condemnation filing in district court.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Oklahoman: OTA awards $97 million for what will be Oklahoma's longest bridge",

    "fullText": "The Avs had an opportunity to be the first team to 50 points tonight, but ultimately, they drop their second loss of the road trip in the shootout to the Nashville Predators 4-3, finishing their east coast trip 2-1-1.\n\nBrock Nelson starts out the scoring with a beautiful deke and a shot that cracks Jusse Saros early. Unfortunately, Scott Wedgewood, in his first game back has a few not-so-good bounces that lead to goals. Jonathan Marchessault capitalizes on a poorly-tracked puck, and Reid Schaefer catches a stagnant Wedgewood to find the league.\n\nArtturi Lehkonen keeps the Avs from heading into the first intermission down and ties it up to make it 2-2 heading into the second period.\n\nA second period that ends scoreless, a ‘no goals’ commercial come to life. The Avs drew a few power plays, but nothing comes of them, and they head into the third on a split power play.\n\nThe third period goes scoreless until just above the seven-minute mark. Wedgewood looks much better in this period, making the first initial saves, but the Preds get it back out high and Brady Skjei finds a lane through traffic (thanks to an unfortunate screen from Sam Malinski) to put Nashville back in the lead.\n\nFear not, with eight seconds left, Cale Makar finds his first goal on the power play in a while, and they grab a point out of a game that they maybe didn’t deserve to.\n\nOvertime is scoreless, but Ryan O’Reilly scores first in the shootout, and he’ll be the lone shootout scorer to push Nashville to win 4-3.\n\nI think he picked up his performance as the game went on, and there’s certainly a conversation to be had about defensive coverage…\n\nBut as far as routine saves go, seems like the two Nashville scored in the first were fairly textbook.\n\nIf at first you don't score, shoot again! pic.twitter.com/hjh5tISYc4\n\n— Nashville Predators (@PredsNHL) December 10, 2025\n\nAnd I get it, right. This is Wedgewood’s first game back since his injury (back tightness per Coach Jared Bednar). Totally fine, especially considering he earned this game back a bit with his performance in the third period. But if you track the puck on the first goal better and lateral movement isn’t nonexistent on the second goal, this game is infinitely easier for the Avs.\n\nDoesn’t help that concussion spotters pull him after Filip Forsberg’s shootout attempt… So, the Avs may have another Wedgewood injury to worry about.\n\nI mean, Cale Makar finally getting his first power play goal since April 3rd, 2025 is an accomplishment, sure. That’s also a goal at 6-on-4, so I’m not counting that one (as pretty as it might be).\n\n8 WITH 8 SECONDS TO GO🥬 pic.twitter.com/iiKIgWeFQ2\n\n— Colorado Avalanche (@Avalanche) December 10, 2025\n\nThis game has an entirely different identity if the Avs can convert on one of the three 5-on-4 opportunities they had in the second period.\n\nI’m not even sure what has to change, except for maybe putting more than just seven shots on goal in six minutes of having a man-advantage.\n\nUltimately, it’s the power play that saves them, but with the third-period lull, you have to get more out of your units in a game like this.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New York Knicks are rumored to be interested in a trade for Milwaukee Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo. The rumor mill was once again ignited after a misleading yet viral post started gaining traction on the internet.\n\nA X user named @BigKnickEnergy_ posted an update, claiming that the Bucks star has just purchased a home in New York. The post has received over 400K impressions within a few hours. Naturally, some were made to believe that it suggests that the Greek Freak was considering a move to New York.\n\nHowever, it didn't take long to figure out why the post was false. The update came with a screenshot that had 18th Nov, 2025, as the date of purchase. That was almost a month ago.\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo just purchased a home in New York 😮😮 pic.twitter.com/tvsPYuzCOj\n\n— Big Knick Energy (@BigKnickEnergy_) December 9, 2025\n\nYes, he did purchase a property, but over a month ago.\n\nThe Bucks star splurged $14.1 million to acquire a 28-unit residential building at 111 Clarkson Avenue, in the Prospect Lefferts Gardens neighborhood of Brooklyn. It is an eight-story apartment building built in 2018. All 28 units in the building are rent-regulated, and the building has an existing tax-abatement benefit under a 421-a program.\n\nIt's a real estate investment with the intention to generate cash flow rather than a personal residence. The building joins his investment portfolio.\n\nMeanwhile, as far as the trade rumors tying Giannis to the Knicks are concerned, the parties were closer in August. Antetokounmpo confided in at least one Bucks teammate that he saw the Knicks as a preferred trade destination. Even the Bucks reportedly asked the Knicks to present them with offers involving the former NBA champion. However, it seems the negotiations or the offers were not enough for a deal to come through.\n\nKnicks’ Josh Hart says he and the Knicks are taking the NBA Cup seriously\n\nKnicks guard Tyler Kolek reveals how he spent NBA Cup prize money\n\nKnicks' Karl-Anthony Towns gets positive injury designation ahead of matchup vs, Raptors",

    "fullText": "Ivory Coast announced their squad for the upcoming African Cup of Nations tournament on Tuesday, with Amad Diallo confirmed to be amongst the mix.\n\nWhile it was anticipated that that would be the case anyway, it has now been set in stone that Ruben Amorim will have to make do without the Manchester United livewire for around a month.\n\nAmad Diallo has been called up by Ivory Coast for the AFCON. pic.twitter.com/CkS7wkgqmq\n\n— utdreport (@utdreport) December 9, 2025\n\n(Photo by Alex Livesey/Getty Images)\n\nThe team aren’t in action until December 24 when they kick off their campaign against Mozambique in Marrakesh.

    "fullText": "Last season, when Ruben Amorim stepped into the Manchester United hotseat, he increasingly relied on the club’s youth to bail the team out of danger.\n\nHe handed debuts to Chido Obi, Tyler Fredricson, and Harry Amass, and at one stage, the Red Devils were second in the list for minutes afforded to teenagers.\n\nBut this season, the head coach has hardly put his faith in Carrington graduates, as Kobbie Mainoo will attest to.\n\nRather surprisingly, despite the obvious lack of quality on the left flank, the 20-time English league champions opted to send Amass out on loan to Sheffield Wednesday, while choosing to keep new recruit Diego Leon at the club.\n\nThe Paraguayan has not managed to make his first team debut, and has looked raw when playing for the U21s, and there are plans to loan him out in January.\n\nInterestingly, Amass’ loan contract with the Owls includes a break clause. The Championship side are desperate to keep him at the Hillsborough Stadium, but United want to revise certain terms before agreeing an extension.\n\nAs revealed by The Daily Mail, there is plenty of interest in the ex-Watford starlet’s services from both the Premier League and Championship.\n\nHarry Amass has two years left on his current United contract, and his parent club have been in touch over a new and improved long-term deal.\n\n“The phone has been ringing off the hook with loan interest from Premier League clubs and Championship rivals, United need to weigh up what their longer term plan is for the teenager – and how that impacts his contract.\n\n“The key word from sources on this one is ‘patience’. While there is optimism that Amass, 18, can remain at Hillsborough for the remainder of the season, and Wednesday’s head of recruitment Kevin Beadell is in talks with United, Confidential understands that nothing has been decided right now.\n\n“Amass has two years remaining on his deal at United, and while talks are ongoing about what the second half of the season holds, part of the discussions has also centred around a potential new and improved contract.”\n\nHis Player of the Month award at Sheffield Wednesday shows how quickly he has taken to life in the second division. United should ideally look to agree a new long-term deal and send him to a higher-placed Championship side or possibly even a Premier League team in the bottom half of the table.\n\nFeature image Matt McNulty via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "As we continue our build up to the visit of Newcastle, which of the Lads could be key to our chances on Sunday?",
    "fullText": "Well, just to start off, I’m absolutely bricking it. I always do, and I always will before the derby.\n\nOur main threat against Newcastle will be down the wings, I expect. Hopefully they field Dan Burn and Kieran Trippier as I feel Romaine Mundle, Bertrand Traoré, Wilson Isidor, Brian Brobbey, Chemsdine Talbi, Eliezer Mayenda, Enzo Le Fée and whoever else can play up top can cause real problems for their defence, irrespective of who’s playing.\n\nEveryone will say Granit Xhaka and Noah Sadiki, but I think the importance is on the attack and their ability to beat their man in the final third.\n\nLike a lot of teams, Newcastle won’t “like it up ’em”, so an on-fire Granit Xhaka is essential.\n\nThat may be a go-to answer, so I’ll also give a shout out to Dan Ballard. Apart from his defensive duties alongside Omar Alderete, I think he’ll be able to cause them great concerns from corners  and free kicks.\n\nBallard had an unfortunate FA Cup game in 2023/2024 so he has even more to prove about his development and improvement since then. His surging runs out from the back are becoming more of a feature of his game, as well as his deft chips to set off an attack, so he’s well capable hurting them in defence and in attack.\n\nCan you imagine a scenario where he scores a late winner? “BALLARD!!”\n\nA derby game can be decided in a single moment, with any individual player stepping forward to make a difference.\n\nWe’ll need a collective effort in terms of performance from all our starters and finishers, but I think Robin Roefs will be just as important as the likes of Dan Ballard, Granit Xhaka and whoever else completes the spine of our side.\n\nRoefs has been in superb form all season and there’ll be difficult moments where we’ll need our Dutch stopper to come to the rescue.\n\nFrom his aerial dominance — which will be tested against the likes of Nick Woltemade — to his shot-stopping ability, I back Roefs to make a string of vital saves which could tip the balance in our favour.\n\nIt was a tough loss to take at Manchester City but after playing them and Liverpool in such a short period of time, it was a touch too much for our strong but still-developing squad.\n\nThat said, we’ve always bounced back from the odd defeat this season, and doing that this weekend will be oh so sweet.\n\nIn terms of players, we’re so much better now than we were in that FA Cup tie, so I’m confident we can take them on all over the park, to be honest.\n\nRobin Roefs is an amazing goalkeeper and will boss his box and distribute very well.\n\nTrai Hume and Dan Ballard will want revenge for the cup loss — especially Ballard after his unfortunate own goal. They’ve both improved massively since that 0-3 loss and surrounded by Nordi Mukiele and Omar Alderete, they’ll be a formidable force for Newcastle’s attack to try and breach. Nick Woltemade will be a handful but if we can negate Erling Haaland, we can handle him too.\n\nIt’s in the middle and up front that I think we have the main upper hand.\n\nWe have the experience, energy and technical prowess in Noah Sadiki, Granit Xhaka and Enzo Le Fée to hold our own against any side, and they showed that against Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool.\n\nUp front, we not have not only Wilson Isidor and Eliezer Mayenda to choose from, but also Brian Brobbey, whereas in the FA Cup, we were playing Nazariy Rusyn with Jobe as a false nine, while a forlorn Hemir sat on the bench.\n\nThe step up in quality since that game is within the realms of trading in a battered old mini for a shiny Ferrari. I do hope they’re all thinking the delta is as it was then, as they’ll get a massive surprise and will be run ragged.\n\nI agree with Anth that the wide men will be key and with Romaine Mundle fit, we have even more options to create out wide and to feed the front men. Both Bertrand Traoré and Chemsdine Talbi have had great run outs of late too, scoring and working very hard, and Mundle is building up his fitness but is already showing glimpses of his ability.\n\nIn short, we have talent everywhere and most of all, we’re a team of great lads with camaraderie, confidence and spirit, led by a tactical genius.\n\nThe Mags only managed to beat Burnley 2-1 at the weekend — with an extra man for over half of the game and through a very dubious penalty, and if they play Dan Burn and Joe Willock down the left, I honestly think any of the above lads will have a field day.\n\nTino Livramento isn’t a bad right back, but with Jacob Ramsey in front of him, that side can be attacked too.\n\nWhen we get closer to the weekend I’ll start getting nervy, but I’m more excited than worried right now. These are the games we wanted back on the list. It’s more than about league points — it’s about bragging rights after centuries of rivalry.",

    "title": "Luke O’Nien: From League One Losses To His Premier League Debut",
    "description": "Despite having an up and down week or so, Luke O’Nien’s legacy at Sunderland is one that should give many budding footballers inspiration.",
    "fullText": "Look, even though he got stupidly sent off at the weekend, Luke O’Nien has fully cemented his legacy as one of the greatest Sunderland players. I’d even argue that he could receive straight red cards for the rest of his career and still not lose the love of so many supporters.\n\nLuke O’Nien’s Sunderland journey is almost a tale as old as time. Brought to Sunderland in 2018 ahead of the club’s first season in League One, he had quite a rocky start. But O’Nien thrived at Sunderland, winning the 2018/19 Sunderland Young Player of the Year, featured in the 2020/21 EFL League One Team of the Season, and starred in the promotion winning squad of 2021/22.\n\nO’Nien’s real legacy at the club comes from the unhinged antics he gets up to on the pitch. We simply can’t forget the double whammy of February and March 2023 with the piggyback from Bristol City’s Alex Scott and the cheeky kiss gifted to Norwich City’s Jacob Sorensen.\n\nLuke also cemented his status off the pitch through his support for the local community and honesty about his tough adventure in football. This connection with the fans meant that he was awarded ‘Club Captain’ in 2024/25.\n\nRegardless of his new title, the antics didn’t stop there. On 31st August 2024, he scored an own goal which single-headedly ended Sunderland’s 389 minute run without conceding. He tweeted: ‘No celebrations for my third goal of the season, but delighted to be the only man to score past Anthony Patterson this season’. Despite causing us pain, at least he made us laugh along the way.\n\nIn December 2024, O’Nien made club history by shattering the record for the most appearances held at the Stadium of Light.\n\nHe then proceeded to get back up to mischief in February, taking out the linesman and deciding to wave his flag. Luke played 47 times in the Premier League promotion winning season and, despite a nasty injury in the 2nd minute of the Playoff Final, he claims he ‘covered more distance celebrating’ than he did playing.\n\nFast forward to 2025/26 and it’s been a tough few months for Luke. After having brought Sunderland all the way from League One for the last 7 years, it’s been painful for fans to watch him not get any game time due to his injury. However, following him finally being put on the substitute bench against Manchester United in October, O’Nien posted a very emotional statement to his Instagram:\n\n‘From sitting on the floor in non-league to walking out at the Theatre of Dreams, all in just over a decade. I remember sitting on the grass at Wealdstone because the bench was full, waiting for my chance and hoping for a moment to prove myself. Last weekend, after a long layoff, I was sitting on the bench at Old Trafford in the Premier League. It’s funny how life comes full circle’.\n\nThen, at long last, in Gameweek 14’s midweek clash between Sunderland and current title holders Liverpool, away at Anfield, Luke O’Nien finally made his Premier League debut.\n\nHe was substituted on in the 91st minute for goalscorer Talbi and our emotions were laid bare. I won’t confirm nor deny whether I shed a tear or two when he was brought on.\n\nIn an emotional most-match interview, O’Nien told: ‘my wife said my kids were up [and] they were jumping up and down when I came on’. He continued with: ‘to come this far with this incredible club, with the fanbase, I think, for the first time in my Sunderland career, I’m lost for words’.\n\nSo thank you, Mr Sunderland, for staying with us through thick and thin. At least you haven’t been given two straight red cards yet.\n\nLuke’s full post-match Instagram caption can be read below:\n\n“For years, I’ve dreamed about playing in the Premier League. Some people laughed at me. Some coaches I had when I was little said I’d never make it. Lots of people told me I wasn’t good enough and to give up. But I’ve always held on to that dream of playing at the highest level. Deep down I believed that if I just kept working, kept learning, kept showing up every single day, then one day it might happen.\n\n“Last night, that dream that 4 year old me had… came true.\n\n“And if you’d told me I’d make my debut at left wing, up against my mate Mo Salah, I’d have laughed as well. From non-league in 2014, to being released by Watford in 2015… there were moments where it felt like this day might never come.\n\n“Sunderland, you’ve been my home for seven years. I never knew I could fall in love with a club, a city, and its people the way I have. You’ve given me space to grow, to fail, to learn, and to find out who I am as a player and a person. To play even a small part in rebuilding this beautiful club and helping it climb back to where it belongs is something I’ll always be proud of.\n\n“Making my Premier League debut… I’m incredibly grateful. Taking a moment afterwards to stand with my mum and dad and breathe it all in… that was special. But that debut chapter is written now. The focus is on pushing on, improving, growing, and helping drive this club forward with this unbelievable group of players.\n\n“Seven years ago we were in League One. Fast forward to last night and we have a team giving everything, disappointed to only get one point against the Premier League champions. If that’s not a moment to stop, reflect, and feel proud, I don’t know what is.\n\n“Thank you to everyone who’s been part of this journey; my family, my friends, the staff, the supporters, and my teammates.",

    "fullText": "Tigers re-sign Kyle Finnegan to a two-year $19 million contract originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAfter dominating for much of the season last year and eventually making the American League Division Series, all eyes have been on the Detroit Tigers this offseason. Would they be able to land a top free agent like Alex Bregman? Would they seriously consider trading Tarik Skubal? Thus far, Detroit hasn't made any moves with the exception of Gleyber Torres signing his qualifying offer.\n\nOn Tuesday night, the Tigers signed their first big free agent of the 2025 offseason, agreeing to bring back Kyle Finnegan on a two-year $19 million contract. The contract can max out at $20 million with incentives.\n\nDetroit acquired Finnegan from the Nationals last season and he impressed in 16 games with the Tigers. Across those games, Finnegan posted a 3-0 record with a 1.50 ERA and four saves. Over the last three seasons, Finnegan has recorded 90 saves.\n\nGiven the familiarity with Finnegan, the price point and the thinning market for relievers, this is a solid deal for Detroit. Just like last season, Finnegan will work in tandem with Will Vest out of the bullpen, another Detroit reliever with closing experience.\n\nNow, apart from Robert Suarez, Pete Fairbanks and Kenley Jansen, there are few closers left on the free agent market. That said, set-up relievers are still available, including Brad Keller, Luke Weaver, Seranthony Dominguez and Tyler Rogers to name a few.\n\nWhile this is a good start for the Tigers, you have to think that they'll need to add a bit more to keep pace with other American League contenders.\n\nFormer GM predicts the Yankees to land Freddy Peralta in a trade with the Brewers\n\nSeattle rumored to trade for Cardinals left-hander\n\nDetroit once again showing strong interest in free agent Alex Bregman",

After making the playoffs in back-to-back years in 2023 and 2024, Baltimore finished 2025 with a 75-87 record and landed in last place in the AL East.\n\nThey fired manager Brandon Hyde in May when the team sat at 15-28 and were officially eliminated from postseason contention on September 16.\n\nRosenthal: Orioles, Marlins discussing Edward Cabrera trade.\n\nOther teams are also in contact with Marlins regarding Cabrera. pic.twitter.com/tgBTDQLjZE\n\n— Underdog MLB (@UnderdogMLB) December 10, 2025\n\nThe organization used 70 different players throughout the season and had 29 players spend time on the injured list, which contributed to their struggles.\n\nNow under new ownership with David Rubenstein at the helm, Baltimore is signaling they are ready to spend like a big-market team.\n\nThis is not the first splash the Orioles have tried to make this offseason. Reports indicate they offered Kyle Schwarber a five-year, $150 million deal that matched what he eventually signed with the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nBaltimore has also already traded for slugging outfielder Taylor Ward from the Angels and signed All-Star closer Ryan Helsley.\n\nMLB agent Scott Boras talked Tuesday about the Orioles' interest in former Mets slugger Pete Alonso, who is one of the most sought-after free agents on the market this offseason.\n\nHe also said that Orioles president of baseball operations Mike Elias has been in regular… pic.twitter.com/c15Ugu8L7R\n\n— The Baltimore Sun (@baltimoresun) December 9, 2025\n\nAdding Tucker would give the Orioles an elite left-handed bat to pair with Gunnar Henderson, Adley Rutschman, and the rest of their young core.\n\nHis swing would also play well at Camden Yards, where left-handed hitters have historically thrived. If Baltimore lands Tucker, they could then package young outfielders like Colton Cowser or Dylan Beavers in trades to address their pitching needs.\n\nThe Orioles still have work to do if they want to compete in an AL East that sent three teams to the postseason in 2025, but talking to Tucker's camp is a sign that Baltimore is serious about getting back to contention.",

    "fullText": "Newcastle United are set to take on Bundesliga giants Bayer Leverkusen in Wednesday night’s Champions League showdown at BayArena.\n\nThe Magpies suffered only their second Champions League defeat last time out when French giants Olympique Marseille came from behind to claim a 2-1 win at Orange Velodrome.\n\nHarvey Barnes put the visitors ahead inside six minutes, but it didn’t take long for that early momentum to fade as Newcastle failed to create another clear opening.\n\nThat loss summed up a Newcastle campaign that has been anything but smooth sailing, although they managed to string a three-match unbeaten run since the defeat in France (W2, D1).\n\nEddie Howe’s troops come into this game on the back of an unconvincing 2-1 win against Burnley, but it should still boost their optimism ahead of the Leverkusen clash.\n\nNewcastle sit 15th in the Champions League standings after taking nine points from five games, but a win against Leverkusen could send them into the top eight if other results go their way.\n\nThere’s enough reason for Newcastle to be optimistic about their chances.\n\nThey arrive in midweek action in decent form, having collected two wins and a draw in their last three outings, scoring eight goals and conceding four.\n\nThey also hold fond memories of past meetings with Leverkusen, winning both previous encounters 3-1.\n\nAfter ripping into his team for failing to control the game better against Burnley, Howe is likely to respond with at least three changes for tonight’s Champions League contest.\n\nWith Nick Pope still struggling to shake off a groin issue, Aaron Ramsdale is set to make his Champions League debut for the Magpies between the sticks.\n\nLewis Hall will likely come in for Dan Burn while Fabian Schar continues his partnership with Malick Thiaw in the absence of the injured Sven Botman.\n\nKieran Trippier is also confined to the infirmary, so Tino Livramento should keep his place at right back.\n\nHowe will likely return to his trusted midfield trio of Joelinton, Bruno Guimaraes, and Sandro Tonali after tweaking the set-up against Burnley.\n\nAlthough he could stick with the same front three of Anthony Gordon, Nick Woltemade, and Anthony Elanga.",

    "fullText": "Braves manager Walt Weiss hints at massive Ronald Acuna Jr. decision for upcoming season originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFor the first time in a long while, the Atlanta Braves will not be led by Brian Snitker at the manager position. However, new manager Walt Weiss will get Ronald Acuña Jr. fully healthy to start the season. Acuña struggled at times last year coming off an ACL injury, but he still managed to make history.\n\n“Ronald Acuña Jr. is the only player to debut in the Divisional Era (1969) to average 30+ HR and 30+ SB per 162 games played (min. 800 games played),” MLB posted.\n\nHe performed well enough to earn NL Comeback Player of the Year, which shows just how good he still is despite two ACL injuries.\n\n“Acuña, 27, tore his left ACL on May 26, 2024, and returned to the Braves this past May 23 and made his fifth All-Star team. He hit .290 with 21 home runs, 42 RBIs and 9 stolen bases,” ESPN wrote in November.\n\nThe Braves are thrilled to begin the season with Acuña healthy, especially as he enters the prime of his career. Weiss is also considering putting him back in the leadoff spot.\n\n“It’s enticing to have him at the top of the order,” Weiss said. “I really like when a lineup turns over and there’s teeth right away. If you’re a pitcher, you’ve got to run through a gauntlet as soon as the lineup turns over.”\n\nGiven Weiss’s comments, it would not be surprising to see the Braves open the season with Acuña leading off. And with Antoan Richardson serving as the baserunning coach, Acuña could find even more success on the basepaths.\n\nAcuña is ready for another MVP-caliber season, and the leadoff spot is an ideal place to get that rolling. Weiss will ultimately do what he believes is best, but his comments now may hint that this will be the final decision come March.",

    "title": "What we’re hearing on Red Sox at Winter Meetings Day 2: Pete Alonso meeting & more",
    "description": "Here's what we're hearing on the Red Sox as the Winter Meetings continue in Orlando.",
    "fullText": "ORLANDO, Fla. — As of Tuesday evening, the Red Sox were still trying to finalize plans to meet with free agent slugger Pete Alonso in person.\n\nAccording to an industry source, the Sox and Alonso have already met via Zoom prior to the start of the Winter Meetings. Not surprisingly, the Red Sox would like to meet in person, too as they ramp up their pursuit of the top power hitter remaining on the free agent market. Plans were complicated somewhat Tuesday by high-ranking front office members battling cold/flu symptoms and limiting in-person interactions throughout the day,\n\nAlonso lives in Tampa, about 75 miles west of Orlando, and could potentially return to the Winter Meetings Wednesday for an in-person meeting. He is known to be bouncing around the Waldorf Astoria Orlando for in-person meetings and the Orioles were reportedly on his list as well.\n\nIt’s likely that Alonso’s ask price increased Tuesday with the news that Kyle Schwarber agreed to a five-year deal with the Phillies. If Schwarber can command a five-year deal just a few months shy of 33, it’s likely that Alonso will be seeking either a six- or seven-year deal. It’s unknown if the Red Sox would be willing to commit to a contract that would pay Alonso to his age 36 or age 37 season.\n\nWhile agent Scott Boras said he expected Alonso’s market to pick up in the wake of the Schwarber deal, a source with knowledge of the bidding said his expectation is that Alonso’s market drags past this week.\n\nIn addition to exploring some free agent solutions, the Red Sox continue to discuss some trade possibilities with several clubs.\n\nOn Monday, MassLive reported talks with the Arizona Diamondbacks centered around second baseman Ketel Marte, while also reporting that the Sox were known to be engaged with three or four other teams.\n\nOne of those potential deals, it’s now known, is with the Houston Astros for corner infielder Isaac Paredes, as The Athletic’s Ken Rosenthal reported Tuesday morning.\n\nParedes can play either first or third and would give the Red Sox a productive right-handed bat. He’ll turn 27 in February and would come with two years of control remaining.\n\nBut Paredes doesn’t have the same power profile as some of the other names being pursued by the Red Sox. He’s only hit more than 20 homers once – a career-high 31 in 2023 while with Tampa Bay.\n\nThe Astros are in the market for young, controllable pitching and have targeted either Payton Tolle or Connelly Early for their desired return. At least one member of the Red Sox organization Tuesday suggested that was too high an asking price. The Red Sox are getting hits on other controllable pitchers like Hunter Dobbins and Kutter Crawford, though, and those arms might interest teams like Houston.\n\nThe Red Sox are certainly open to adding two bats, though the chance of two high-priced free agent additions seems low.\n\nPart of the motivation for finding a taker for infielder Vaughn Grissom Tuesday was to clear a spot on the team’s 40-man roster to enable them to potentially make a selection in Wednesday’s Rule 5 draft.\n\nTrading Grissom leaves the Red Sox with an open spot; they’re currently at 39.\n\nIn recent years, the Red Sox have been fairly active in the Rule 5, landing Garrett Whitlock in the 2020 draft and fellow reliever Justin Slaten in the 2023 draft.\n\nBoth times, however, the Red Sox were in rebuilding mode with no real expectations to contend, making it somewhat easier to utilize a season-long active roster spot for an untested player.\n\nNow that the Red Sox, a playoff team last October, have designs on competing for a pennant, do they still have the ability to take a gamble on a Rule 5 choice?\n\n“We’re still working through what our approach will be tomorrow —collecting information, identifying areas of the roster that could benefit from the available player pool,“ said chief baseball officer Craig Breslow. ”But I’m not sure it’s necessarily true that it’s been informative of a competitive level or competitive window.\n\n“You can look at the success of some our recent Rule 5 picks and say that those guys were able to contribute on a championship-caliber team. We need to find the right fit. We need to make sure that we’re not going to hamstring ourselves because 2026 is really important season for us in terms of wins.”\n\nIn any case, Grissom had fallen out of favor with the Red Sox and was too low on their depth chart to continue holding a 40-man roster spot.\n\nIn his media availability with reporters, manager Alex Cora may have provided a hint as to how a divisional rival might use a new free agent signee.\n\nLefty Steven Matz, who reportedly agreed to a two-year, $15 million contract with the Rays late Monday, might return to starting despite making 51 of his 53 appearances as a reliever in 2025. During Matz’s two-month stint with the Sox after a trade deadline deal, Matz made it clear to Cora he felt like his days in a rotation aren’t over.\n\n“I talked to him throughout September and October,” Cora said. “He felt like he wanted to be a starter again, and no doubt about it, he’ll be fine. Strike-throwing machine, workaholic, good guy. They’ve got a good one.”\n\nRelief market a possibility for Sox\n\nDon’t discount the possibility of the Red Sox adding a veteran reliever or two via free agency. While adding power is clearly a priority at this point — and pitching additions are on the back-burner — there remains the possibility of Boston adding someone as a bridge to Garrett Whitlock and Aroldis Chapman.\n\nOne name the Red Sox have checked in on? Seranthony Dominguez, though nothing is hot there as of Tuesday night.\n\nRed Sox landed the perfect pitcher last winter; Finding the perfect hitter is proving considerably harder | Sean McAdam\n\nRed Sox trade rumors: Boston exploring deal for Rangers All-Star (report)\n\nRed Sox have new challenge for Wilyer Abreu in ‘26: ‘He has earned the right,’ says Craig Breslow\n\nMany key Red Sox will play in World Baseball Classic; what about Aroldis Chapman for Great Britain?\n\nAs Boston Red Sox pursue Alex Bregman, Alex Cora explains ‘less is more’",

At the end of the day, sport is sport. It demands heart, sacrifice and teamwork.\"\n\nCamel racing is a traditional sport which is particularly popular in the Middle East.\n\nPogba set to make first appearance since doping ban\n\nWhy Monaco have gambled on 'wildcard' Pogba\n\n\"People might not realise it, but sport always connects in some way,\" added Frenchman Pogba.\n\n\"Whether it's football, camel racing, boxing - the foundations are similar. You need determination, you need focus, you need discipline and grit. That's what makes champions at the end of the day.\"\n\nPogba, who became the world's most expensive player when he joined Manchester United from Juventus in 2016 for £89m, added: \"Being the world's most expensive footballer was an honour, but it also came with a lot of hard work, pressure and responsibility.\n\n\"Owning the world's most expensive camel one day would be a beautiful full-circle moment - something fun, something meaningful and something that excites me. Maybe one day we make it happen.\"\n\nAl Haboob, founded by entrepreneurs Omar Almaeena and Safwan Modir, is the world's first modern camel racing team to compete internationally.\n\n\"Paul's involvement is transformational,\" said Almaeena.\n\n\"His influence, leadership, and passion for cultural storytelling reflect exactly what Al Haboob stands for. This partnership is about more than racing; it is about sharing a heritage that deserves global recognition.\"\n\nPogba made his long-awaited return to professional football on 22 November after coming on as a late substitute in Monaco's 4-1 Ligue 1 defeat by Rennes.\n\nThe 2018 World Cup winner had not played since featuring for Juventus against Empoli in September 2023, following an original four-year doping ban, that was cut to 18 months by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas).\n\nPogba maintained it was a mistake and he was given a supplement without knowing it contained a banned substance.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Italy’s failure to qualify automatically for the 2026 World Cup inevitably sparked plenty of debate across this once-proud footballing nation.\n\nLosing home and away to Norway consigned Italy to the play-offs and left them facing the prospect of missing out on the tournament for the third consecutive time.\n\nHead coach Gennaro Gattuso inevitably resorted to deflection tactics towards the end of European qualifying, bemoaning the revised system that seemingly favors other continents.\n\n“In my day, the best group runners-up went straight to the World Cup, now the rules have changed,” Gattuso said.\n\n“Italy’s record of six wins? You’d have to ask the people who make the groups and the rules. In 1990 and 1994, there were two African teams, now there are nine. It’s not a controversy, but there are difficulties, and we know it well.\n\n“If we look at South America, where six out of 10 teams go directly to the World Cup and the seventh heads into a play-off with a team from Oceania, that does give you regrets and a certain sadness. That is the disappointment. The system needs to change in Europe.”\n\nPutting aside the fact there are some factual inaccuracies in Gattuso’s comments, the 2020 European champions have only themselves to blame for their current situation.\n\nItaly were the top seeds in a relatively easy group, yet failed to get the job done. However, you flower it up, losing to Norway by a combined 7-1 scoreline is unacceptable.\n\nThe decision to appoint Gattuso to replace Luciano Spalletti looked questionable when it was announced, and subsequent events have done little to dispel that notion.\n\nGattuso was a fine player – a combative midfielder who helped AC Milan win the Champions League twice and Italy lift their last World Cup trophy in 2006.\n\nHowever, his managerial record at club level was hugely underwhelming and Italy’s decision to place him in charge may yet have a catastrophic ending.\n\n“When I heard Gattuso was online it just seemed to demonstrate the giant collapse of Italy,” Italian football journalist Mina Rzouki told the Euro Leagues podcast.\n\n“There were so many clips going around on social media about that Italy team just before they won the World Cup and you are talking about Paolo Maldini, [Fabio] Cannavaro, [Alessandro] Nesta, [Francesco] Totti, [Alessandro] Del Piero and it was just an embarrassment of riches.\n\n“Now when you look at Italy over the last few seasons, even though they won the Euros, there was just a fall – but the one thing you could rely on was that Italy created these great coaches. Yet none of these great coaches were called up or have succeeded.”\n\nPlay-off draw offers Italy hope\n\nItaly’s hopes of progressing to the World Cup were boosted after they were handed a relatively favorable draw in the play-offs.\n\nThey will host Northern Ireland in the semi-final, with the winners of that game visiting either Wales or Bosnia & Herzegovina in the final.\n\nThe last four tie against Northern Ireland should hold little fear for Italy. They suffered defeats at Germany and Slovakia in the group stage and generally don’t travel too well.\n\nHaving won seven and drawn three of their previous 11 meetings, Italy have little to fear from a team ranked 69th in the latest FIFA rankings.\n\nOn paper, Wales are the biggest threat to Italy. They are ranked 32nd in the world and are generally tough to beat on their own patch.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that they have never defeated Bosnia & Herzegovina in four previous attempts. The visitors will fancy their chances of enhancing that record.\n\nUltimately, given that Italy are currently ranked 12th in the world, they should be able to successfully navigate through the play-offs.\n\nThey have lost just twice to Wales in ten previous meetings and once to Bosnia & Herzegovina in six matches. If Italy fail to progress, they have no excuses.\n\nWhile suggesting that Italy could mount a challenge for the World Cup next summer is a little fanciful, stranger things have happened in football.\n\nThey demonstrated their credentials by winning the 2020 European Championship title and can draw inspiration from what they achieved on that occasion.\n\nAside from Spain and France, none of the other so-called main contenders for the World Cup are significantly better than Italy.\n\nIf they safely navigate the play-offs and land a favorable draw next summer, Italy are perfectly capable of making a deep run in the tournament.",

    "fullText": "ORLANDO, Fla. — The Red Sox don’t anticipate ace Garrett Crochet or star rookie Roman Anthony participating in the World Baseball Classic in the spring. Regardless, Boston will be well-represented in the tournament.\n\nIn addition to reliever Garrett Whitlock, who will pitch for Team USA, there are many other Boston players expected to participate, according to manager Alex Cora and chief baseball officer Craig Breslow. Outfielders Jarren Duran (Mexico) is committed and Ceddanne Rafaela (Netherlands) and Wilyer Abreu (Venezuela) appear likely to join him. Reliever Jovani Morán will pitch for Puerto Rico. There are plenty of players in the “maybe” category, too, including Marcelo Mayer (Mexico), Aroldis Chapman (Great Britain) and Brayan Bello (Dominican Republic)\n\nCatcher Carlos Narváez (Venezuela) and designated hitter Masataka Yoshida (Japan) are unlikely to suit up in the tournament considering the injuries they dealt with in 2025.\n\nCora, who played twice for Puerto Rico and served as the island’s general manager in 2017, said the Red Sox encourage all their players to participate if it makes sense for them to do so. The tournament, which will be played from March 5-17, will pull players out of spring training.\n\n“I love the tournament,” Cora said. “There’s some injury factor, and stuff happens. But it can happen in Houston. It can happen in Miami and Puerto Rico. It can happen in Fort Myers. But they have to play baseball.”\n\nCora said Crochet decided not to represent Team USA because his of his 2025 workload, which surpassed 200 innings. Narváez had offseason knee surgery and will be re-assessed in camp. Whitlock, Duran, Rafaela and Abreu all ended the season healthy and should be able to participate with no restrictions. Situations involving other players are more complicated.\n\nOne such case is Mayer, who after missing the last two months of the season with a wrist injury, will be looking to compete for a starting infield spot in camp. He has expressed his interest in suiting up for Mexico but is not yet committed because he’s recovering from surgery.\n\n“There’s certain rules within the tournament as far as injured players and insurance and surgeries and all that. So we’ll see where we’re at,” Cora said. “I know when we went to Monterrey, when he left Monterrey, he was like, ‘I want to play in the tournament.’ So we’ll see where we’re at. They’re kind of, like, 50/50, Mexico, understanding that he had surgery and there’s other stuff that comes up with the whole thing.\n\n“It’s complicated, to be honest with you. But if he gets cleared, from our standpoint, if he wants to do it, we’re OK with it.”\n\nBello, who pitched a career-high 166 ⅔ innings in the regular season, wants to pitch for the Dominican Republic but the team will be careful with his build-up to the season.\n\n“He’s potentially a candidate but also there will be conversations there,” Breslow said. “The last couple years, he has come into spring training a little bit behind so that’s something who we want to make sure we’re sensitive to.”\n\nChapman, who re-signed with the Red Sox in September toward the end of an All-Star first season in Boston, is leaning toward pitching for Great Britain, though his paperwork has not yet been finalized, in part because it has been hard to access records from the Cuban government. Chapman is eligible to pitch for Great Britain because of his Jamaican heritage, which makes him eligible for British citizenship and therefore, participation in the tournament.\n\nRed Sox landed the perfect pitcher last winter; Finding the perfect hitter is proving considerably harder | Sean McAdam\n\nRed Sox trade rumors: Boston exploring deal for Rangers All-Star (report)\n\nWhat we’re hearing on Red Sox at Winter Meetings Day 2: Pete Alonso meeting & more\n\nRed Sox have new challenge for Wilyer Abreu in ‘26: ‘He has earned the right,’ says Craig Breslow\n\nAs Boston Red Sox pursue Alex Bregman, Alex Cora explains ‘less is more’",

    "description": "The Red Sox have gone out of their way to limit Wilyer Abreu's exposure to left-handed pitching so far in his career. Assuming he's not traded, expect that to change in 2026.",
    "fullText": "ORLANDO, Fla. — In his first two major league seasons, Wilyer Abreu has been a platoon player. The Red Sox have made sure to limit his exposure to left-handed pitchers in an effort to maximize their lineup every day.\n\nAssuming Abreu isn’t traded before Opening Day, expect that to change in 2026. The Red Sox want to have a two-time Gold Glove right fielder in their lineup every day, and to do so, plan to challenge Abreu to face lefties in the batter’s box.\n\n“With Willy and some of the lefties, we have to see if they can do it,” said manager Alex Cora. “It’s about that time, especially with Abreu. If he can hit lefties and hit for power and play defense the way he’s done the last few years, he can be the guy.”\n\nSince debuting late in the 2023 season, Abreu has gotten just 15 starts against left-handed starters — and 145 total plate appearances. In those chances, he has struggled to a .205 average and .589 OPS, numbers markedly lower than his output against righties (.265 average, .827 OPS). In 2025, the Red Sox played 45 regular season games — and two \n\nSince Cora took over as manager in 2018, the Red Sox have slow-played their young left-handed hitters when it comes to like-handed matchups. Rafael Devers, Triston Casas, Abreu and Marcelo Mayer all come to mind. Others, like Casas and Mayer, might still get limited chances come Opening Day, but it sounds like the Red Sox are ready to take the training wheels off when it comes to the 26-year-old Abreu.\n\n“Wilyer is a really good player,” said chief baseball officer Craig Breslow. “We’ve seen the way he’s able to impact both sides of the ball. He has earned the right to get some added runway against left-handed pitching. We feel like it’s an adjustment he’s capable of making. He’s got such a solid defensive floor that having him out there more often than not is going to help the overall team.”\n\nIn recent years, the Red Sox were willing to play the matchup game on a daily basis because they had lefty-mashing platoon players like Rob Refsnyder and Romy Gonzalez on the roster. Refsnyder, though, is a free agent, and as MassLive reported Monday, has a strong market that includes other American League contenders and could lead to him receiving a two-year deal.\n\nIf Refsnyder departs, at-bats will be available, especially with southpaws on the mound. Abreu will likely get some of them with utility players Kristian Campbell and Nate Eaton serving as other candidates for increased playing time. It was notable Tuesday that Cora went out of his way to praise Eaton, potentially setting the table for him to take over as a Refsnyder replacement.\n\n“Nate, last year, the way he played in September, that was eye-opening,” said Cora. “The athlete. Actually, the at-bats were really good. So we’ve got some intriguing guys that can step up, very athletic guys that can help us.”\n\nRed Sox landed the perfect pitcher last winter; Finding the perfect hitter is proving considerably harder | Sean McAdam\n\nRed Sox trade rumors: Boston exploring deal for Rangers All-Star (report)\n\nWhat we’re hearing on Red Sox at Winter Meetings Day 2: Pete Alonso meeting & more\n\nMany key Red Sox will play in World Baseball Classic; what about Aroldis Chapman for Great Britain?\n\nAs Boston Red Sox pursue Alex Bregman, Alex Cora explains ‘less is more’",

    "description": "There's no perfect deal to make for a hitter. But the Red Sox have to do something.",
    "fullText": "ORLANDO, Fla. — It was almost exactly a year ago Wednesday, the final day of the 2024 Winter Meetings, that the Red Sox acquired Garrett Crochet in exchange for four prospects from the Chicago White Sox.\n\nIn almost every measurable way, it turned out to be the perfect trade for the Red Sox. Crochet soon signed a six-year extension to give the team additional control of him, making the player cost more tenable. Then, Crochet went out and pitched like the ace the Red Sox projected he could be, leading the league in strikeouts and innings pitched while finishing second in wins and third in ERA.\n\nIt was, from the benefit of 12 months later, the perfect offseason move. The Red Sox got precisely what they needed to head their rotation and locked him up for the foreseeable future.\n\nBut this winter has served as a reminder of how rare those kinds of transactions are.\n\nThe Red Sox are in search of at least one and possibly two hitters to improve a lineup that, while in the top third of the game in terms of runs scored, was otherwise perfectly ordinary when it came to power. They finished right smack dab in the middle in home runs and managed just one in three playoff games.\n\nTo date, they’ve come up empty, which doesn’t mean there aren’t still options available, even with the news that Kyle Schwarber is staying put in Philadelphia. There’s still time and still choices available.\n\nBut none is going to fit the club the way Crochet did a year ago, something Craig Breslow tacitly acknowledged Tuesday.\n\n“Everybody goes into the offseason with their ideal outcomes,” said Breslow, “and you quickly realize that that’s the most unlikely path. There is a sliding scale but our offensive profile lacks a little bit of thump and that’s where we’ve set our sights.\n\n“But there are other ways to improve the team. There will be other ways to improve the team. But I think we’re going to exhaust that type of power profile first before we look at alternatives.”\n\nSchwarber, good as he is — second in homers to only Shohei Ohtani over the last four years and able to hit lefties as well as righties — was a DH only, bringing next to no defensive value. And he’ll be 33 before next season begins.\n\nSort through the other possibilities for the Red Sox and they’re similarly flawed in one way or another.\n\n∗ Trade target Ketel Marte is signed for another five years at a cost of more than $100 million dollars and comes with some questions about his level of commitment after missing the first three games of the Arizona Diamondbacks first three games after the All-Star break.\n\n∗ Free agent Pete Alonso is regarded as a poor first baseman and is a slow baserunner. At 31, those deficiencies are only going to get worse.\n\n∗ Free agent Bo Bichette is a limited defender who, though he has very good bat-to-ball skills, doesn’t really profile as a power hitter. He’s never hit as many as 30 homers in a single season and, in fact, has hit more than 24 just once.\n\n∗ Trade target Isaac Paredes is versatile — able to play both first and third — but is at best average at both spots. His career OPS of .766 is somewhat underwhelming.\n\n∗ Free agent Alex Bregman, while a solid fit for both Boston and the Red Sox, isn’t so dynamic that he alone can lift the team’s offensive profile. They had him in the lineup last year and that wasn’t nearly good enough.\n\nThe list goes on and on, with every potential acquisition sporting a concerning weakness or negative.\n\nThen there’s the acquisition costs — nine-figure free agent contracts or, in the case of trade candidates, sacrificing some of the team’s precious young pitching.\n\nAnd that’s if a trade can be made\n\n“I think that, maybe more so than in past years, teams are really content to hold their really good players,” said Breslow. “In a lot of the conversations that we’ve had, a number of teams have conveyed that they’re very comfortable holding their players. As are we. So that does add a layer of difficulty in making these things work.”\n\nUltimately, though, none of that matters. The Red Sox can’t afford to let perfect be the enemy of good. Just because each of their upgrade options are flawed in one way or another doesn’t mean they should try to get by with what they have.\n\nThe Sox are at a crossroads. They’re good enough to be a playoff contender but not good enough to win a World Series. To reach that level, they need to be bold — bold enough to add two bats.\n\nAnd if the players aren’t as perfect on the hitting side as Crochet was on the pitching side, they’re just going to have to live with that.\n\nRed Sox trade rumors: Boston exploring deal for Rangers All-Star (report)\n\nWhat we’re hearing on Red Sox at Winter Meetings Day 2: Pete Alonso meeting & more\n\nRed Sox have new challenge for Wilyer Abreu in ‘26: ‘He has earned the right,’ says Craig Breslow\n\nMany key Red Sox will play in World Baseball Classic; what about Aroldis Chapman for Great Britain?\n\nAs Boston Red Sox pursue Alex Bregman, Alex Cora explains ‘less is more’",

    "fullText": "Chelsea now face a real uphill struggle if they want to qualify for the last 16 of the Champions League after last night.\n\nThe Blues got beat 2-1 by Atalanta, with head coach Enzo Maresca getting some big criticism for his subs that he made in the game, many attributing this to the main reason why they lost the game.\n\nAt one point, Maresca had THREE full backs playing in centre midfield, when you count Marc Cucurella playing the annoying inverted full back role – basically a centre midfielder in possession. Yet Andrey Santos was an unused sub.\n\nAlso, when Wesley Fofana got injured, instead of putting Josh Acheampong at centre back and using one of the two other right backs he had on the pitch, he took Fofana off and put Tosin Adarabioyo on, who has been awful in recent games.\n\nEven still, Maresca has defended his decisions and the subs he made, even doubling down on them in his post-match interview. Madness.\n\nJoe Cole was unhappy with the defeat in his post-match analysis for TNT Sports and once again highlighted the lack of experience being a big issue at this club, which is genuinely is and has been for years.\n\nAs things currently stand, Chelsea are 11th in the league stage of the UCL but could slip further down the table depending on results elsewhere today.\n\n16 points could be enough for a top eight finish to automatically qualify for the last 16, so Chelsea must beat Pafos and Napoli to have any chance of this.\n\nIf they do not get automatic qualification they will face playing two extra games in the playoffs to try and get there, and no club wants an extra games right now.\n\nThey will also have David Luiz and Antonio Conte stood in our way! Luiz currently plays for Pafos, and Conte is the Napoli manager! Yikes.",

    "fullText": "Is Victor Wembanyama playing tonight vs. Lakers? FInal status for Spurs star originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs will look to keep their dreams of winning the NBA Cup alive when they travel to Los Angeles to take on the Lakers in a cup quarterfinal game on Wednesday night. Unfortunately, the Spurs won’t have the services of star center Victor Wembanyama in the game.\n\nWembanyama has been sidelined since he suffered a left calf strain against the Golden State Warriors on Nov. 14. He’s missed 11 straight games for the Spurs, and he’s still not ready to return to game action quite yet.\n\nThe former No. 1 pick has been officially ruled out of the game against the Lakers as he continues to recover from the calf strain.\n\nThe good news for Spurs fans is that Wembanyama recently returned to practice as a full participant, so a return should be on the horizon. Following their game against L.A., the Spurs have a full week off from games. That extended stretch of rest could be beneficial for Wembanyama, who could potentially return when the Spurs host the Washington Wizards on Dec. 17.\n\nWhile the Spurs would obviously like to have Wemby available for what projects to be a challenging matchup with the Lakers, they’ve been able to hold it down without him. They’ve gone 8-3 in the 11 games that he missed and they currently sit fifth in the Western Conference standings with a record of 16-7.\n\nBefore he went down with the calf injury, Wembanyama was playing the best ball of his young career. In 12 appearances on the season, he’s averaging 26.2 points, 12.9 rebounds, 4.0 assists, 3.6 blocks and 1.1 steals per game. He was also the heavy favorite to win Defensive Player of the Year. His ability to win that award is now in jeopardy due to the 65-game minimum threshold that was established by the NBA a couple of years back.\n\nThe cup contest on Wednesday night will be the second meeting of the season between San Antonio and L.A. The Lakers pulled out a 118-116 victory over the Spurs in early November. Wembanyama played in that game and had 19 points, 8 rebounds and 3 assists in 33 minutes.",

    "fullText": "It’s been a tough few months for Ibrahima Konate.\n\nThe Liverpool defender hasn’t been at his best this season - being responsible for numerous individual errors which have cost his team.\n\nThe latest shoddy moment came in the weekend draw against Leeds at Elland Road. With the Reds coasting to a 2-0 win, the 26-year-old jumped in on Willy Gnonto recklessly and gave away a penalty.\n\nLeeds duly scored and picked up their momentum - eventually earning a 3-3 Premier League draw.\n\nKonate’s drop in standards could not have come at a worse time for the player - with contract negotiations with sporting director Richard Hughes reportedly ongoing.\n\nThe France international is out of contract in 2026 - and would in theory be seeking a massive pay rise from his current wage of around £140k per week.\n\nShop the goalkeeper range today\n\nShop the third kit range today!\n\nHe will be available to speak to potentially interested clubs in a matter of weeks - and Liverpool could be left with an awkward decision to make.\n\nRight now he isn’t showing the form of a player worth a long-term contract of £200k per week or over. And so if he rejects Liverpool’s attempts to tie him down on the club’s terms then he could be considered for sale in January.\n\nLiverpool could then put the proceeds towards a replacement centre-back - either Marc Guehi or Nico Schlotterbeck.\n\nDefensa Central is now reporting that Real Madrid are set to commit a massive transfer U-turn over Konate - and a bid of €15m in the winter window is being prepared.\n\nMadrid have fallen apart under Xabi Alonso in recent weeks - and defensive totem Eder Militao is now expected to miss several months of action owing to an injury suffered over the weekend.\n\nLos Blancos therefore are ready to reverse their decision NOT to chase Konate - who they’d previously been chasing on a free transfer for summer 2026.\n\nThis could represent the ideal opportunity for Liverpool to get an underperforming high-earner off the books and rake in some money they’d miss out on if he left for free.\n\nOnce again the decision will come down to the sporting director - who really needs to put the defensive department right having missed out on Guehi last summer.",

If Lyon is included along with Cummins, it could mean seamers Brendan Doggett and Michael Neser are left out.\n\nAustralia have another decision to make over Usman Khawaja. The left-hander was unable to open in the first Test because of a back problem, which then caused him to miss the second Test.\n\nTravis Head and Jake Weatherald have formed an impressive opening partnership in his absence. Khawaja could therefore be competing with Josh Inglis for a place in the middle order.\n\nWhile Australia's players have returned home between Tests, the England squad have taken a break in the beach town of Noosa. They will return to training on Sunday.\n\nIn order to get back into the series, England must end a 17-Test winless run in Australia when they take the field at the Adelaide Oval.\n\nAlthough Australia have won the previous three Ashes series in this country, they squandered a 2-0 lead in England in 2023 to draw 2-2.\n\n\"The way we've started the series has been good,\" said Carey. \"To come to Adelaide 2-0 is a good position to be in, but we understand the series is definitely not over.\n\n\"You can get into trouble if you start looking at the end of the series in Sydney already.\n\n\"We know England are a very good cricket team and we know we were in a position like this in England, then we weren't able to win that series.\n\n\"We're excited for the opportunity we've got, but also understand we have to keep playing good cricket.\"\n\nAshes history offers little statistical hope for England - Zaltzman\n\nEngland need to win next Test or Ashes will get embarrassing - McGrath\n\nEngland fast bowler Wood out of Ashes tour",

    "fullText": "Ben Foster has poured praise on Manchester United summer signing Matheus Cunha.\n\nThe former goalkeeper’s comments came just before United’s win over Wolverhampton Wanderers on Monday night, which saw Cunha oversee a tremendous display on his first return to Molineux following his exit in June.\n\n(Photo by Alex Livesey/Getty Images)\n\nWhile the Brazilian was unable to get on the scoresheet, he recorded his first assist for United when selflessly setting up skipper Bruno Fernandes, when he very easily could’ve netted the opener – and his second goal – when one-on-one with Sam Johnstone.\n\nYet, it was Cunha’s performance against West Ham that had Foster completely wowed by what he’d seen.\n\n“Cunha is a player, by the way,” said Foster on his show, the Fozcast.\n\n“Honestly, I went to West Ham the other night. Honestly, he is unreal, by the way. He just looks like he’s getting even better.”\n\nRuben Amorim will certainly be intrigued by the latter claim, as he’ll need the 26-year-old to really step up to the mark in Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo’s absences when the African Cup of Nations gets underway later this month.\n\n(Photo by Justin Setterfield/Getty Images)\n\nIt’s expected Benjamin Sesko will be back at the coach’s disposal by the time United’s internationals depart, but Cunha, who boasts three-and-a-half seasons worth of Premier League experience over the young Slovenian, will likely occupy the main focal point of United’s attack.\n\nThat being said, Sesko has scored once more than his senior counterpart in one less appearance.\n\nNext up for the Reds is a visit from an out-of-form Bournemouth side in yet another Monday evening slot next week, followed by a trip to Villa Park on Sunday, December 21.\n\nBen Foster says Amorim has a player in his ranks who’s just ‘unreal’, and he’s ‘getting even better’\n\nConfirmed: Amorim will have to make do without ‘special’ star for crunch festive fixtures after new development\n\nAgent: £66m attacker will play for Man United ‘sooner than expected’ in huge boost to Amorim",

    "description": "Drama early and late gave Nashville the 4-3 victory.",
    "fullText": "One last stop on a four-game road trip, the Colorado Avalanche were hoping to end the jaunt on a high note but that didn’t come to fruition as they lost in a shootout to the Nashville Predators by a score of 4-3. This one was a doozy with high drama in both the opening and closing minutes with a real lull in the middle.\n\nCale Makar scored his elusive power play goal to send the game into overtime with eight seconds remaining. Ryan O’Reilly netted the lone shootout marker to give Nashville the win.\n\nIt was an eventful start to say the least with four goals scored at the net front in the opening 10 minutes of the game. Brock Nelson took advantage of some lackadaisical defending to put the visitors up by one just a minute into the contest. Jonathan Marchessault gathered his own rebound off of the returning Scott Wedgewood to quickly tie the game for Nashville three minutes later. Ninety seconds after that Nelson gave one back with some poor coverage on Reid Schaefer. Finally, Artturi Lehkonen worked his magic at the net front to get the Avalanche back to an even score at 2-2 by the halfway mark. And that’s how the first period would end after the flurry of goals concluded.\n\nThe second period was a stark contrast as no goals were scored. Colorado received three power plays, just about all in a row at the end of the period but couldn’t convert so the game remained tied 2-2 after 40 minutes of play.\n\nAction started to heat up again in the third period when Brady Skjei fired a low shot which went post-and-in just over the halfway point of the period. From there Nashville tried to shut the door, which almost worked until they took a penalty with under two minutes remaining. With the extra attacker the Avalanche flirted around the perimeter but a Cale Makar shot from the blue line finally found it’s way to the back of the net got his first power play goal of the season and sent the game into overtime with the score tied 3-3.\n\nNashville held a slight advantage in shots 5-4 in the extra frame as the play went back-and forth. The real drama ensued when the shootout began, however.\n\nRyan O’Reilly went first in the skills competition and put a tally on the board for Nashville. Martin Nečas missed his shot and then Filip Forsberg missed as well. But in the process Forsberg ran right over Scott Wedgewood who seemed a little stunned by the hard contact. Then Val Nichushkin’s shot was saved by Juuse Saros, Steven Stamkos missed his shot as well so it was up to Gabe Landeskog to give it one last shot for Colorado. Right before beginning his turn the officials notified the Avalanche bench that Wedgewood was being pulled by the concussion spotters and Mackenzie Blackwood was summoned to take his place in the Avalanche net. Landeskog then missed his shot and the game was over 4-3 in favor of Nashville.\n\nThe stars shone bright in this contest and nearly burned out. Cale Makar played over 30 minutes in this game Nathan MacKinnon over 28 minutes himself. Six forwards didn’t even get to the 13 minute mark. If you can’t trust your depth to beat the worst team in the league at the end of a long road trip do you truly have depth?\n\nIt’s curious as to why Gavin Brindley was taken off injured reserve but didn’t play in this contest. Yes, Martin Nečas was a game-time decision with illness and then eventually suited up but it shouldn’t take someone unable to play to get Brindley back in action. Zakhar Bardakov played five minutes in this game. If Brindley is really a key part of this lineup then why didn’t he play?\n\nWith his assist on the Lehkonen goal, Nathan MacKinnon became the first player in the NHL to score 50 points this season in his 900th career NHL game. MacKinnon was also first to the milestone last season as well. Congrats, Nate!\n\nA meeting at Ball Arena with the defending Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers is on tap. The game will be nationally televised on ESPN at 7:30 p.m. on Thursday, December 11th.",

    "fullText": "Enzo Maresca is still dividing opinion at Chelsea. Despite a Club World Cup win and a top 4 finish last year, as well as an overall bright start to this campaign, there are a lot of doubters about the Italian coach.\n\nChelsea icon Gianfranco Zola speaking on the pitch at Stamford Bridge.\n\nOne person who isn’t in any doubt about him is club legend Gianfranco Zola. He claims he saw the coach’s talent before he had even come to Stamford Bridge.\n\n“I didn’t know him personally before he came to Chelsea, but I had followed what he did at Leicester and could see that we were dealing with a serious coach,” Zola said.\n\n“He’s worked with and for [Arrigo] Sacchi, Manuel Pellegrini, [Pep] Guardiola. He’s had an excellent grounding.”\n\nThere are a lot of positives about Maresca which nobody can dispute – he seems to have a lot of respect from the players and as Zola says, he’s got a great background in terms of people he’s worked under.\n\nHowever many Blues fans still aren’t delighted with the football he has his teams playing, and there are other gripes about his rotation policy and team selection in general. There’s also a sense he doesn’t get the best out of our star player, Cole Palmer.\n\nIt will be very interesting to see how feelings change through the course of the coach’s second year in charge.\n\nChelsea’s social media silence over one player this week was very notable – it doesn’t look like things are getting sorted out in this case anytime soon.\n\nChelsea managed to get a player into the Premier League team of the week in the week just gone – but it’s not the sort of player you want to see in there.

    "description": "Even visitors from countries like Britain and France, whose citizens don’t need visas, would have to share five years’ worth of social media.",
    "fullText": "Travelers visiting the United States from countries like Britain, France, Germany and South Korea could soon have to undergo a review of up to five years of their social media history, according to a proposal filed on Tuesday by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nThe change would affect visitors eligible for the visa waiver program, which allows people from 42 countries to travel to the United States for up to 90 days without a visa as long as they first obtain electronic travel authorization.\n\nIn a document filed on Tuesday in the Federal Register, C.B.P. said it plans to ask applicants for a long list of personal data including social media, email addresses from the last decade, and the names, birth dates, places of residence and birthplaces of parents, spouses, siblings and children.\n\nUnder the current system, applicants from visa waiver countries must enroll in the Electronic System for Travel Authorization program. They pay $40 and submit an email address, home address, phone number and emergency contact information. The authorization is good for two years.\n\nThis move from C.B.P. follows similar actions by the U.S. government to conduct social media reviews for some visa applicants, including seekers of the H-1B visas awarded to skilled foreign workers, as well as applicants for student and scholar visas. It also follows the government’s pending plans to collect a new $250 visa integrity fee from many visitors, though visitors from visa waiver countries are exempt from that fee.\n\nThe travel industry has pushed back on the visa integrity fee. In November, a coalition of more than 20 tourism and travel businesses signed a letter of opposition, citing concerns that the fee would discourage millions of prospective international visitors to the United States, including those traveling to events like next year’s World Cup.\n\nA travel industry official who spoke anonymously because his organization had not yet had time to review the proposal said C.B.P. did not brief industry stakeholders on the plan, which he called a significant escalation in traveler vetting.\n\nIn the notice, C.B.P. said it would accept 60 days of public comments on the proposal.\n\nIf the plan is approved, C.B.P. could enact the changes gradually over the following weeks and months, the immigration law firm Fragomen said in an alert. Bo Cooper, a partner at Fragomen, called the government’s new approach to social media screening a “paradigm shift” from when agencies used social media to verify specific facts, such as criminal activity.\n\n“The new method involves looking at online speech, and then denying travel based on discretion and policy about the kinds of things that get said,” Mr. Cooper said, adding, “It’ll be interesting to watch the tourism numbers.”\n\nThe firm warned that the government’s increase in data collection could result in longer waits for travelers to get authorization to visit the United States, in addition to “an increased likelihood of being flagged for closer scrutiny.”\n\nSophia Cope, a senior staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, said in a statement that the mandatory social media disclosure and surveillance would “exacerbate civil liberties harms.”\n\n“It has not proven effective at finding terrorists and other bad guys,” she added. “But it has chilled the free speech and invaded the privacy of innocent travelers, along with that of their American family, friends and colleagues.”\n\nC.B.P. did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nFollow New York Times Travel on Instagram and Dreaming up a future getaway or just armchair traveling?

    "description": "Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis show that psychedelic compounds such as psilocybin appear to distort the link between blood flow and brain-cell functioning, which scientists use to track brain activity.",
    "fullText": "Psilocybin is a psychedelic drug with promising clinical applications for treating mood disorders and substance abuse disorders. Recent work in functional MRI (fMRI) studies show that psychedelics can reset brain network activity — and it is thought that this effect, which can linger for days, might explain its therapeutic benefits.\n\nPsychedelics such as psilocybin act on a chemical in the brain called serotonin that controls the relaxation and contraction of blood vessels. Because fMRI uses changes in blood flow and blood oxygen levels in the brain as a proxy for brain activity, a team of WashU Medicine researchers set out to determine if these signals remained an accurate measure of brain activity in subjects dosed with a similar psychedelic that acts on the same chemicals.\n\nThey observed, in mice given this drug, that blood flow did not change as it normally would in relation to the activity of brain cells called neurons. When combined with a second medication that blocks a specific receptor in the brain that responds to serotonin, the blood flow effects from the psychedelic drug were removed.\n\nThe team’s subsequent studies using psilocybin in mice produced similar results to those observed with the first drug. Reanalyzing results from an earlier fMRI study in human subjects given psilocybin revealed similar effects on brain responses.\n\nThese results have important implications for how researchers interpret fMRI scans of brain activity in people who have taken psychedelics, and they may aid the scientific search for how psychedelics achieve their potential therapeutic effects.\n\nThe research was led by Adam Q. Bauer, an associate professor at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis’ Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology; Jordan G. McCall, an associate professor of anesthesiology in the Center for Clinical Pharmacology; and Joshua S. Siegel, MD, PhD, who conducted the work at WashU Medicine and is now an assistant professor at New York University. The study was published in Nature Neuroscience.\n\nTogether, the results from mice and humans indicate that the neurovascular effects of psychedelics need to be better understood when interpreting blood flow-dependent neuroimaging. As compounds like psilocybin are increasingly studied for treating conditions including post-traumatic stress disorder, treatment-resistant depression, substance abuse and stroke, understanding how psychedelics affect the reliability of brain scans as a proxy for brain activity is important for clinicians and researchers examining the effects of these drugs.",

    "description": "We’re on a journey to advance and democratize artificial intelligence through open source and open science.",
    "fullText": "We gave Claude the ability to fine-tune language models using a new tool called Hugging Face Skills. Not just write training scripts, but to actually submit jobs to cloud GPUs, monitor progress, and push finished models to the Hugging Face Hub. This tutorial shows you how it works and how to use it yourself.\n\nClaude Code can use \"skills\"—packaged instructions, scripts, and domain knowledge—to accomplish specialized tasks. The hf-llm-trainer skill teaches Claude everything it needs to know about training: which GPU to pick for your model size, how to configure Hub authentication, when to use LoRA versus full fine-tuning, and how to handle the dozens of other decisions that go into a successful training run.\n\nWith this skill, you can tell Claude things like:\n\nThe model trains on Hugging Face GPUs while you do other things. When it's done, your fine-tuned model appears on the Hub, ready to use.\n\nThis isn't a toy demo. The skill supports the same training methods used in production: supervised fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. You can train models from 0.5B to 70B parameters, convert them to GGUF for local deployment, and run multi-stage pipelines that combine different techniques.\n\nHugging Face skills are compatible with Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini CLI. With integrations on the way for Cursor, Windsurf, and Continue.\n\nThis repo includes gemini-extension.json to integrate with the Gemini CLI.\n\nYou have to authenticate to your Hugging Face account with a write-access token so that the job can create a model repo.\n\nConfigure Hugging Face MCP Server to use your write token by sending it in either the HF_TOKEN or Authorization: Bearer HTTP Headers.\n\nFor Claude Code : claude mcp add --transport http hf-skills https://huggingface.co/mcp?bouquet=skills --header \"Authorization: Bearer $HF_TOKEN\"\n\nLet's walk through a complete example. We'll fine-tune a small model to see the full workflow, then explore more advanced capabilities.\n\nStart with a simple and clear instruction to fine tune a specific model\n\nThe coding agent analyzes your request and prepares a training configuration. For a 0.6B model on a demo dataset, it selects t4-small—enough GPU for this model size and the cheapest option available.\n\nThe open-r1/codeforces-cots dataset is a dataset of codeforces problems and solutions. It is a good dataset for instruction tuning a model to solve hard coding problems.\n\nBefore your coding agent submits anything, you'll see the configuration:\n\nThis is your chance to adjust anything. Change the output repo name, pick different hardware, or ask Claude to modify training parameters. Once you approve, the agent submits the job.\n\nFor example, you can ask the agent to try a test run:\n\nAfter submission, you get job details:\n\nThe skill includes Trackio integration, so you can watch training loss decrease in real-time. Jobs run asynchronously so you can close your terminal and come back later. When you want an update:\n\nThen the agent fetches the logs and summarizes progress.\n\nClick here for an example Trackio dashboard with some completed runs.\n\nWhen training completes, your model is on the Hub:\n\nThat's the full loop. You described what you wanted in plain English, and the agent handled GPU selection, script generation, job submission, authentication, and persistence. The whole thing cost about thirty cents.\n\nThe skill supports three training approaches. Understanding when to use each one helps you get better results.\n\nSFT is where most projects start. You provide demonstration data—examples of inputs and desired outputs—and training adjusts the model to match those patterns.\n\nUse SFT when you have high-quality examples of the behavior you want. Customer support conversations, code generation pairs, domain-specific Q&A—anything where you can show the model what good looks like.\n\nThe agent validates the dataset, selects hardware (a10g-large with LoRA for a 7B model), and configures training with checkpoints and monitoring.\n\nFor models larger than 3B parameters, the agent automatically uses LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) to reduce memory requirements. This makes training 7B or 13B models feasible on single GPUs while preserving most of the quality of full fine-tuning.\n\nDPO trains on preference pairs—responses where one is \"chosen\" and another is \"rejected.\" This aligns model outputs with human preferences, typically after an initial SFT stage.\n\nUse DPO when you have preference annotations from human labelers or automated comparisons. DPO optimizes directly for the preferred response without needing a separate reward model.\n\nDPO is sensitive to dataset format. It requires columns named exactly chosen and rejected, or a prompt column with the input. The agent validates this first and shows you how to map columns if your dataset uses different names.\n\nGRPO is a reinforcement learning task that is proven to be effective on verifiable tasks like solving math problems, writing code, or any task with a programmatic success criterion.\n\nThe model generates responses, receives rewards based on correctness, and learns from the outcomes. This is more complex than SFT or DPO, but the configuration is similar.\n\nThe agent selects hardware based on your model size, but understanding the tradeoffs helps you make better decisions.\n\nFor tiny models under 1B parameters, t4-small works well. These models train quickly—expect $1-2 for a full run. This is perfect for educational or experimental runs.\n\nFor small models (1-3B), step up to t4-medium or a10g-small. Training takes a few hours and costs $5-15.\n\nFor medium models (3-7B), you need a10g-large or a100-large with LoRA. Full fine-tuning doesn't fit, but LoRA makes these very trainable. Budget $15-40 for production.\n\nFor large models (7B+), this HF skills job is not suitable.\n\nWhen testing a workflow, start small:\n\nTh coding agent configures minimal training—enough to verify your pipeline works without real cost.\n\nAlways run a demo before committing to a multi-hour production job. A $0.50 demo that catches a format error saves a $30 failed run.\n\nDataset format is the most common source of training failures. The agent can validate datasets before you spend GPU time.\n\nThe agent runs a quick inspection on CPU (fractions of a penny) and reports:\n\nIf your dataset needs transformation, the agent can show you how:\n\nThe agent provides mapping code and can incorporate it directly into your training script.\n\nReal-time monitoring helps you catch problems early. The skill configures Trackio by default—after submitting a job, you can watch metrics at:\n\nThis shows training loss, learning rate, and validation metrics. A healthy run shows steadily decreasing loss.\n\nAsk the agent about status anytime:\n\nIf something goes wrong, the agent helps diagnose. Out of memory? the agent suggests reducing batch size or upgrading hardware. Dataset error? The agent identifies the mismatch. Timeout? The agent recommends longer duration or faster training settings.\n\nAfter training, you might want to run your model locally. The GGUF format works with llama.cpp and dependent tools like LM Studio, Ollama, etc.\n\nThe agent submits a conversion job that merges LoRA adapters, converts to GGUF, applies quantization, and pushes to Hub.\n\nWe've shown that coding agents like Claude Code, Codex, or Gemini CLI can handle the full lifecycle of model fine-tuning: validating data, selecting hardware, generating scripts, submitting jobs, monitoring progress, and converting outputs. This turns what used to be a specialized skill into something you can do through conversation.\n\nThe skill is open source. You can extend it, customize it for your workflows, or use it as a starting point for other training scenarios.\n\nIs this still usable without a Pro account? Will it be able to output everything up to \"Submit the job to Hugging Face Jobs\"?\n\nIs there data privacy when doing this?\n\nIs it posted privately to a personal/team hub?\n\nCould this be done locally without the push to the repo?\n\nAnother agentic way of wasting tokens\n\nis it possible to use this inside vscode's copilot extension ?\n\nSkill documentation is not available at the provided link - https://github.com/huggingface/skills/blob/main/hf-llm-trainer/SKILL.md\n\nAh, we moved a couple of bits around in the repo -- link for that is here: https://github.com/huggingface/skills/blob/main/hf-llm-trainer/skills/model-trainer/SKILL.md -- I'll update the article 👍.\n\n\"Really fascinating read! I found the explanation of Hugging Face’s “Skills Training” initiative — how it lets you use a coding‑agent (like Claude Code or other supported agents) to fine‑tune large language models, submit GPU jobs, monitor progress and push trained models to the Hub — particularly eye‑opening. The combination of high‑level instructions, hardware selection, monitoring, and automation makes the complex process of model training much more approachable, even for developers who may not be ML‑infrastructure experts.\n\nI also recently read a related guide: https://mobisoftinfotech.com/resources/blog/ai‑development/llm‑api‑pricing‑guide\n — which gives practical advice on LLM API usage, token‑based pricing, and how to plan costs when working with LLMs.\n\nPutting your article’s look into empowering accessible LLM fine‑tuning together with the cost‑management strategies from that guide gives a well‑rounded perspective: it helps developers understand not just what is possible now with modern tools, but also how to build and deploy responsibly, balancing capability and cost.\"\n\nGreat work and great article!\nRegarding the maximum models size we can train using this approach, at the beginning of the article it's mentioned \"models from 0.5B to 70B parameters\" but at the end you write that \"For large models (7B+), this HF skills job is not suitable\", which order of magnitude is correct?\nI suspect the max range is 7B, if it's the case, do you plan to support training of larger models?\nThanks!\n\nis the trained model now open source and / or available to the public?\n\n·\n Sign up or\n log in to comment",

    "description": "Here's the \"boring\" path to riches that doesn't involve starting a business, investing in real estate or inheriting the money.",
    "fullText": "You may be surprised to find out that about 18% of Americans are millionaires, translating to roughly 25 million individuals, according to a report by Wealth Management USA. And while there are plenty of ways to accumulate a seven-digit net worth, some avenues are more common than others.\n\nFind Out: 6 Money Moves Wealthy People Always Make Before New Year’s\n\nFor You: 6 Subtly Genius Moves All Wealthy People Make With Their Money\n\nMany millionaires start their own business or invest in real estate to earn their riches, while others imply inherit the money. But the number one way that Americans become millionaires is actually within reach of average workers, provided they start early and stick to their plan.\n\nHere’s the “boring” path to riches that doesn’t involve starting a business, investing in real estate or inheriting the money.\n\nWant the “easy” way to a million dollars? Continually investing regularly is the best way to build wealth.\n\nAccording to a report from Morningstar, investors who have $1 million or \n\nTrending Now: Here’s the Minimum Net Worth Considered To Be Upper Class in Your 70s\n\nThere are several reasons why consistent investing is the “easy” path to $1 million. First, regularly adding money to your investments regardless of the market environment ensures that you’ll get an average price. You’ll be buying more stock when prices are low and less when prices are high. You won’t be putting all your money in either at the absolute bottom or at the peak, but since the long-term trend of the market is up, getting that “average” price provides a significant return.\n\nSecond, by consistently investing in “boring” options like mutual funds, 401(k) funds or high-quality stocks, you won’t be taking on excess risk. With automated contributions coming out of your paycheck or bank account, you won’t get tempted to chase the latest investment fad, a mistake that costs many novice investors their entire bankroll. As preservation of capital is half the battle when it comes to building wealth, automatically contributing to relatively “boring” investments can help protect your bankroll over the long run.\n\nThe third reason why consistent investing works is a simple one. If you continually add money to your account, you’ll have more money in it. If you simply invest $30,000 and watch it grow, you may end up with $60,000, $120,000 or even $240,000 in your account, depending on how long you keep it invested. But if you regularly add $1,000 per month to your account for 40 years, you’ll have contributed $480,000. A simple double of your money over time would be nearly enough to reach that $1 million level.",

However, environmental protection officers found a wider mix of items, reporting \"discrepancies between the documents and the actual state of affairs.\"\n\nThe cargo included used clothing, electrical appliances, shoes, underwear, blankets, toys, and cosmetics. Classified as \"mixed waste,\" the shipment required a special import permit, which the driver did not have.\n\nHe was interrogated and fined 1,770 euros (about $2,055 USD), and the goods were seized for further investigation. The incident illustrates broader environmental concerns.\n\nWhile secondhand textiles are commonly imported and legally traded in Europe, improperly labeled or illegally imported waste can end up in facilities unequipped to handle it or be dumped or burned illegally, creating health and ecological hazards.\n\nCases like this serve as reminders that environmental protection depends on enforcement and responsible practices.

    "fullText": "The US Food and Drug Administration is looking into whether deaths “across multiple age groups” have been related to Covid-19 vaccines, a spokesperson said Tuesday, weeks after a senior agency official claimed — without offering evidence – that Covid-19 vaccinations resulted in the deaths of 10 children.\n\nAndrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services, said the FDA is conducting “a thorough investigation” but declined to offer details on what data sources are being used and what potential changes, if any, are being considered to Covid vaccine approval or marketing.\n\nDr. Vinay Prasad, the FDA’s chief medical and scientific officer and director of its Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, claimed in a memo late last month that “Healthy young children who faced tremendously low risk of death were coerced, at the behest of the Biden administration, via school and work mandates, to receive a vaccine that could result in death.”\n\nPrasad did not provide details about the 10 deaths or how the FDA came to that conclusion but pointed to “an initial analysis” that examined 96 deaths and linked 10 to the Covid-19 vaccination. He also claimed that Covid “was never highly lethal for children” and that the effects of it “are comparable” to respiratory viruses for which there aren’t annual vaccines.\n\nMore than 700 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been administered in the US since they became available in late 2020, according to the World Health Organization. The shots have been extensively tested and continually monitored for safety, and serious side effects such as anaphylaxis or myocarditis have been generally rare.\n\nFDA regulations require health care providers to report deaths after vaccination to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), even if it’s not clear that vaccination was the cause of death. Members of the general public can also submit events to the database, which federal agencies use to generate further study on vaccine safety.\n\nPrasad said that as a result of the FDA analysis, the agency will adopt a new approval process for vaccines that will require more evidence of their safety and value before they can be marketed. Among the changes would be stricter requirements for authorization of vaccines used for pregnant women and trials for pneumonia vaccines that will need to prove the shots reduce disease, instead of showing that the vaccine produces enough antibodies to fight the illness.\n\nThe agency will also “revise the annual flu vaccine framework,” Prasad said, and “will re-appraise safety and be honest in vaccine labels.”\n\nHHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has repeatedly raised doubts about the effectiveness of vaccines and previously founded the anti-vaccine group Children’s Health Defense.\n\nAs secretary, Kennedy has slashed funding for mRNA vaccine development, replaced the members of the vaccine advisory committee at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and directed the CDC to change its website to include false claims that link autism and vaccines.\n\nCNN’s Kaanita Iyer, Adam Cancryn and Amanda Sealy contributed to this report.",

    "description": "The USS Arizona was one of the most historically significant warships in military history. The Navy just removed 150 tons of concrete from its remains.",
    "fullText": "After over 80 years in the water, the U.S. Navy has removed more than 150 tons of aging concrete mooring platforms from the USS Arizona. This move comes as the Navy and the Pearl Harbor National Memorial finish their months-long effort to protect and preserve the major U.S. Navy ship sunk during World War II. After years of planning, a team started this project in September 2025, taking the last of the two platforms from the water about a month later. Removing these concrete platforms was effectively the final step. Today, only small sections remain to avoid disturbing one of the most historically significant warships in military history.\n\nThe process involved using a crane barge and diamond wire saw to cut and lift concrete segments from the sunken battleship. Navy Mobile Diving and Salvage Unit 1 led the work alongside help from federal contractors. This was no small feat, as the team's schedule often involved many 12-to-14-hour days to get the job done on schedule.\n\nWhy now? Well, officials said the project addressed some long-standing concerns that the massive structures might eventually collapse through the USS Arizona's deteriorating decks. The concrete platforms were first installed after the attack at Pearl Harbor to support the salvage of guns and munitions. There they've remained ever since.\n\nSince it was an underwater job, several environmentalists were involved in the uninstallation process. Experts in marine resources, historic preservation, water quality, and water safety were on standby for continuous support. That way, the platforms could be removed without harming the surrounding harbor ecosystem, the memorial, or any of the people working to remove them in the first place.\n\nThe USS Arizona Memorial, managed by the National Park Service since 1980, spans the midsection of the sunken battleship and is accessible only by boat. Built in 1962, it serves as both a national monument and the final resting place for those hundreds of sailors and Marines who died aboard the ship — not to mention any survivors who later chose to have their ashes interred there. This major undertaking helps make sure the memorial is no longer under threat of damage, allowing future generations to still visit the U.S. battleship for years to come.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "fullText": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin asserted only a year ago that no power can ban Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) regardless of what happens to the dollar. While many saw it as a message to the West on international sanctions, the country has taken targeted steps to open its economy to the world’s largest cryptocurrency.\n\nDuring an investment conference in Moscow on Dec. 4, 2024, Putin argued that the influence of the dollar on the global economy was waning, paving the way for the growth of other instruments.\n\n“For instance – Bitcoin. Who can prohibit its use? No one,” Putin said. “Or the use of other electronic ways of settlement. No one can ban the use of them.”\n\nPutin added that the new instruments would “continue developing” regardless of what happens to the dollar.\n\nDon’t Miss: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nShortly after these comments, Russia’s Finance Minister Anton Siluanov revealed that Russian companies have started using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for cross-border transactions, described as a response to trade disruptions from sanctions imposed after the Ukraine war.\n\nThe minister said that it was possible to use the Bitcoin mined in Russia in foreign trade.\n\nIt’s worth noting that Putin greenlighted Bitcoin mining in the country earlier that year. He previously rejected the central bank's proposal to ban cryptocurrencies in 2022, arguing that the country possesses \"competitive advantages\" in the field of mining.\n\nIn accordance with Putin’s directives, the central bank proposed in March of this year to allow a limited number of “highly qualified” Russian investors to purchase and sell cryptocurrencies under a new three-year experimental legal regime.\n\nThe bank maintained that it still doesn’t see cryptocurrency as a means of payment and proposed a ban on all cryptocurrency transactions between Russian residents outside the experimental regime.\n\nSee Also: Fast Company Calls It a ‘Groundbreaking Step for the Creator Economy' — Investors Can Still Get In at $0.85/Share\n\nHowever, recent developments suggest attempts to expand cryptocurrency access for Russians. Bank of Russia First Deputy Governor Vladimir Chistyukhin said that rules should be eased beyond the “extremely narrow” category of qualified investors, given the sanctions in place, according to a Cryptopolitan report.",

    "description": "The latest JOLTS report shows hiring stuck at 3.2% and quits falling again as the Fed prepares to cut rates.",
    "fullText": "Mark Zandi is worried that the labor market no longer has a buffer.\n\nSo many Americans are “already living on the financial edge,” the chief economist for Moody’s Analytics told Fortune. If they start to pull back, that’s “fodder for a recession.”\n\nThe stark assessment comes as hiring has stalled, unemployment is rising—especially for the most vulnerable workers—and layoff announcements are piling up. To Zandi, the next stage is already visible: “If we actually do see layoffs pick up,” he told Fortune, “then it certainly would be a jobs recession.”\n\nZandi reached that assessment before the government released its long-delayed JOLTS report Tuesday, but the official numbers largely confirm the pullback he has been tracking through private data. Since the summer, job openings have risen by only a few hundred thousand and remain far below the highs seen in the frenzy of the pandemic. Layoffs upticked slightly, while quit rates fell, a sign that workers are increasingly hesitant to leave their current positions. Hiring, meanwhile, has held at 3.2%, a level consistent with employers who are not actively slashing staff but are no longer expanding their workforces either: a “low hire, low fire” market.\n\nIf the cooling in the official data looks slow, the private indicators tell a sharper story. ADP’s November report found that private employers cut 32,000 jobs, the steepest decline in more than two years. Nearly all of those losses came from small businesses, which eliminated 120,000 positions. Larger employers moved in the opposite direction and kept hiring.\n\nFor Zandi, the pattern is not random. He sees it as the continuation of a break that appeared earlier in the year, when the administration escalated reciprocal tariffs.\n\n“If you look at when job growth really came to a standstill, it is back soon after Liberation Day,” he said.\n\nBecause these firms often lack the financial cushions that larger corporations can draw upon, payroll becomes the most immediate and often the only mechanism through which they can respond to rising input costs. The result, Zandi argues, is a labor market in which the earliest fractures appear among precisely the kinds of employers most sensitive to policy and price shifts. Those fractures then begin to ripple outward, first through hiring freezes and only later, if conditions worsen, through broader layoffs.\n\nSo for Zandi, if ADP offers a snapshot of the present, the data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas hints at what may lie ahead. Employers have announced 1.1 million layoffs this year, a figure surpassed only during the pandemic shock of 2020 and the depths of the Great Recession. These announcements are global, and not all will materialize as U.S. cuts, Zandi advised, yet he considers their scale meaningful because they reflect decisions made months in advance of actual separations.",

The proposal will be discussed in a virtual meeting with U.S. officials Tuesday, she said.\n\nMexico is behind water deliveries to the United States from the Rio Grande River because of drought and pipeline limitations, Sheinbaum said.\n\nUnder a 1944 treaty, Mexico must deliver 1.7 million acre-feet of water to the U.S. from six tributaries every five years, or an average of 350,000 acre-feet every year. An acre-foot is the amount of water needed to cover 1 acre of land to a depth of 1 foot.\n\nTrump posted on social media Monday that Mexico has a water debt that has accumulated over five years and that is affecting farmers in Texas. He said that he has authorized a 5% increase on tariffs on Mexico if the water is not immediately released.\n\n“The U.S needs Mexico to release 200,000 acre-feet of water before December 31st, and the rest must come soon after,” Trump wrote. “As of now, Mexico is not responding, and it is very unfair to our U.S. Farmers who deserve this much needed water.”\n\nTrump first threatened tariffs over the water issue in April when he also threatened to impose 5% tariffs on Mexican imports and accused the country of continuing to violate the agreement.\n\nThe two countries have reached agreements on the issue in the past and the Mexican president said she hoped they would again find an understanding.\n\n“We have the best intention to deliver the amount of water that is owed from previous years,” Sheinbaum said.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",

Yet, a Redditor shared a frustrating experience of just that with an anti-car subreddit.\n\n\"I was walking with my daughter on a sidewalk in the neighborhood,\" the user explained. \"She was about 5 ft behind me - we were playing with walkie talkies.\"\n\nDisrupting this wholesome fun was a man who said he was a former police officer. He offered his unsolicited two cents that the daughter was walking too far behind and could be accidentally hit by truck drivers during the holiday season. His rationale for that was unclear.\n\nThe OP didn't respond to the officer but expressed frustration over the encounter, considering he himself was in a large truck and \"he was part of the problem.\" Additionally, they added that moving to an area with good walkability and low car traffic was an intentional decision. They later noted the incident was at 6 a.m. on a barely-trafficked road.\n\n\"Yet, this truck man stopped to explain to me that I am wrong,\" the OP concluded. \"This makes me wish I didn't live in the US.\"\n\nThis unsettling story highlights real concerns about the country's priorities when it comes to walkability and pedestrian safety. There is ample evidence domestically and overseas that walkable cities are effective in reducing air and noise pollution while enhancing the richness of a place.\n\nFrustratingly, there are far too many places where cars are given the upper hand, leading to an overwhelming number of vehicles on the road. Even when this isn't the case, if the cars are increasingly monstrous trucks, they can both inconvenience or endanger pedestrians due to their huge size and poor visibility.\n\nThere are positive examples of communities exploring solutions like improving public transportation and enhancing pedestrian-friendly infrastructure. Still, the attitude the man showed toward the parent unfortunately remains in many drivers and lawmakers.\n\nCommenters empathized, with many expressing outrage at the retired cop's attitude.\n\n\"Sounds like he was projecting his intrusive thoughts of running over your kid,\" a user suggested.\n\nA commenter was baffled: \"They're in trucks because of the holidays.

    "description": "President Donald Trump is touring swing states to defend his tariffs and sell the message that the economy is booming.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is standing by his tariffs, at least in theory.\n\nUnder the banner \"Lower Prices, Bigger Paychecks,\" Trump kicked off the first of a series of speeches to promote his economic message in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, as polls indicate the country is increasingly concerned about the rising cost of living.\n\n\"They always have a hoax,\" Trump told the crowd, referring to criticism from Democrats that his policies drove up prices. \"The new word is 'affordability.'\"\n\n\"Democrats are like, 'prices are too high.' Yeah, they're too high because they cause them to be too high,\" Trump added. \"But now they're coming down.\"\n\nLater, he said, \"I can't say affordability is a hoax because I agree the prices were too high. So I can't go to call it a hoax because they'll misconstrue that.\"\n\nTrump, during the 90-minute speech, also reiterated that his favorite word is \"tariff\" and credited his policies for bringing in \"hundreds of billions of dollars,\" presumably for the government in tariff revenue.\n\n\"You can give up certain products,\" Trump said at one point. \"You could give up pencils. Because under the China policy, you know, every child can get 37 pencils. They only need one or two, you know. They don't need that many.\"\n\nDespite standing by his tariff policies, Trump has, in reality, rolled back many of his earlier tariffs, especially ones enacted on April 2.\n\nTariffs are still higher than they have been in many decades, but the original 25% tariff on every import from Mexico and Canada was walked back to exclude all items covered in the USMCA trade agreement, which includes most imports from the two neighbors. Tariffs on imports from China, once more than 100%, have been reduced to a baseline tariff of 10%, which applies to all other countries.\n\nOn top of that, in an attempt to address the price of groceries, Trump also modified and removed tariffs on a range of food products in November, such as beef, coffee, bananas, and tomatoes.\n\nOf the remaining tariffs, evidence points to an impact on the price of consumer goods.\n\n\"Our analysis suggests that tariff measures are already exerting measurable upward pressure on consumer prices,\" according to a report published in October by the Federal Reserve of St. Louis that looked at data from January to August of this year. \"The rise in prices beginning in early 2025 coincides closely with tariff developments, and our model-based regressions confirm that these effects are statistically and economically significant.\"\n\n\"At the same time, the pass-through remains partial; only a portion of the model-predicted effect has materialized so far,\" the report added. \"This could reflect delays in price adjustments, competitive pressure limiting firms' ability to raise prices, or expectations that the tariffs may prove temporary.\"\n\nTrump's speech comes as consumer sentiment remains low. According to the University of Michigan's survey of consumers, sentiment dropped to 51 points in November, which is the second-lowest score the index has ever recorded since 1952, narrowly topped by a score of 50 in June 2022.\n\nEarlier on Monday, in an interview with Politico, Trump said that he would give his economy a grade of \"A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.\"\n\nSome Democrats have centered their pre-2026 midterm messaging on affordability, and several have explicitly blamed rising costs on Trump's tariff and trade policies. Zohran Mamdani, the New York City mayor-elect, with whom Trump had a meeting, also won while running primarily on making the city more affordable.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

Its more recent investments include prediction markets company Kalshi, and the legal tech startup Harvey.\n\nGrady, who has been with the firm for nearly 19 years, explained that before a startup gets a yes or no, everyone on the team votes on a scale of one to 10. A score above six is considered \"positive,\" and a score of four or below is considered \"negative.\"\n\n\"If everybody's a six, probably shouldn't make the investment. It's consensus, but nobody has conviction,\" he said. \"If three people are nines and three people are one, we should probably make the investment because the presence of the nines is a much more powerful signal than the presence of the ones.\"\n\nLin, who has been with the firm since 2010, said they follow this strategy because the firm is in the business of risk-taking.\n\n\"We need that volatility because the truth is not somewhere in the middle where everybody agrees,\" he said.\n\nThe partners said that they train their junior investors, who are historically \"A+\" students, to build a risk appetite.\n\n\"A lot of the people that join our team haven't had much failure, and we have to help them get comfortable with it because otherwise we're not going to get the outlier wins,\" Grady said.",

    "description": "The battlefield is still dominated by aerial drones, which Syrski said are carrying out 60% of all strikes against Russian targets in the war.",
    "fullText": "Ground drones are growing more popular on Ukraine's front lines, but they're still vastly overshadowed by the small aerial drones made famous in the war.\n\nIn November, uncrewed ground vehicles accounted for less than 0.66% of Ukraine's total drone missions.\n\nUsage numbers were announced on Tuesday by Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander in chief of Ukraine's armed forces, as he gave a statement on the war situation this winter.\n\n\"At the current stage of the war, it is unmanned aerial vehicles that provide about 60% of all strikes on enemy targets,\" Syrskyi wrote.\n\nThe military chief said that in November alone, Ukrainian uncrewed aerial vehicles, or UAVs, carried out over 304,000 missions, striking or destroying roughly 81,500 targets.\n\n\"Over the past six months, this indicator has been constantly growing,\" Syrskyi added.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian uncrewed ground vehicles, or UGVs, carried out 2,000 missions in the same timeframe, he said.\n\nThe statistics underscore just how aerial drones continue to dominate the battlefield in Ukraine. UGVs, an emerging technology, are still finding their footing in the war as Kyiv moves to integrate them at a wider scale among its military units.\n\nAmid the push, dozens of Ukrainian companies and units have been debuting their own UGVs, which can range from miniature buggies to full-size trucks mounted with remote machine gun turrets.\n\nThe ground drones are particularly useful because they can perform dangerous frontline missions that human soldiers would otherwise be required to carry out. Ukrainians are building them to serve a variety of purposes, from direct assaults and mine-clearing to monitoring roads and delivering frontline supplies.\n\nSome units have begun using aerial and ground systems in tandem, such as troops in Pokrovsk who used a UGV to spot incoming Russian vehicles through fog and later attacked with exploding drones.\n\nRussia has also been pioneering new drones, including UGVs for logistics and rocket artillery. On the aerial front, the Kremlin's forces were the first to introduce unjammable, fiber-optic drones that are now proliferating on the battlefield.\n\nThis year, Moscow has repeatedly been reported to be more readily integrating drone warfare into its ranks, scaling up mass production, forming official drone units, and creating new warfighting doctrine after observing Ukrainian tactics.\n\nSyrskyi wrote that Russia had, at one point, reached a \"period of a certain parity\" with Ukraine in the use of first-person-view drones, or the small hobby drones souped up to fly explosives into targets.\n\n\"As reported by our intelligence bodies, the enemy seeks to reach monthly deliveries of up to half a million FPV drones to its troops,\" he wrote.\n\nNow, however, Syrskyi claimed that Ukraine has recently surpassed Russia in first-person-view drone usage.\n\n\"The Ukrainian response must be asymmetric and effective: strengthening the fight against enemy drones and destroying the infrastructure of the enemy's unmanned forces units,\" he added.\n\nSyrskyi's statement offered a grim recap of the war in recent months, saying that Ukraine's forces have \"faced some of the most serious challenges since the beginning of the full-scale war.\"\n\nBoth civilians and soldiers in the country must soon grapple with another brutal winter, as temperatures are expected to consistently drop below freezing in January and February. Russia has been targeting local energy grids, disrupting Ukraine's access to reliable heating.",

    "fullText": "Rivian's CEO and founder, RJ Scaringe, said the US needs a lot more cheap electric vehicles.\n\nSpeaking at the Fortune Brainstorm AI conference in San Francisco on Tuesday, Scaringe said a lack of choices was the reason for low EV penetration in the US.\n\nHe said that electric vehicle adoption in the US, at 8%, is significantly lower than in the rest of the world.\n\n\"I really think the constraint isn't the demand side, I think it's the supply side,\" Scaringe said. \"I think there's a shocking lack of choice, that there are much better choices in Europe. And by far, there's the most choice in China.\"\n\nHe said that for consumers interested in EVs, there were \"well under five great choices\" at a price point close to the average price of a new car in the US.\n\nHe added that, within a price range of $50,000, there was only one compelling choice of EV: a Tesla. In October, Tesla unveiled its most affordable models to date: the $36,990 Model 3 Standard and the $39,990 Model Y Standard.\n\n\"And that's not a reflection of a healthy market with lots of choice,\" Scaringe said. \"If you think of it as a consumer, you have 300 different internal combustion engine choices at that price or lower, and you have maybe one highly compelling EV choice.\"\n\nRivian is working to provide cheaper EV alternatives. It is gearing up to start production on its cheapest EV to date, the R2 model, a $45,000 SUV.\n\nIn the interview, Scaringe also said he agrees with the Trump administration's push to bring manufacturing back to the US.\n\n\"I think the push to industrialize in the United States is appropriate, and it's something we're very aligned with the administration on,\" he said.\n\nThe US EV industry comprises Rivian, Tesla, Ford, General Motors, Hyundai, BMW, and Kia, among others.\n\nBrands like Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Tesla dominate the EV market in Europe. Chinese brands like BYD, NIO, and MG also sell on the continent.\n\nMeanwhile, the EV industry in China is seeing fierce competition. BYD, Tesla's biggest global rival, saw its sales fall 12% in October compared to the same period a year earlier, as it faces a tough fight from local EV startups Xpeng, Nio, and Leapmotor.\n\nOther players, such as smartphone manufacturer-turned EV maker Xiaomi, are also seeing success in the country with strong sales.",

    "fullText": "Silver blew past $60 per troy ounce for the first time on Tuesday, extending its blistering rally as traders race into a metal increasingly linked to the build-out of AI infrastructure.\n\nThe milestone caps a stunning run in 2025: silver has more than doubled this year, far outpacing gold's roughly 60% gain and leaving many traditional commodity forecasts in the dust.\n\nWhile expectations of further Federal Reserve easing have helped fuel the move, surging industrial demand and persistent supply tightness are also powering silver's fierce price gains.\n\nVeteran Wall Street strategist Ed Yardeni wrote on Tuesday that silver's explosive rally can't be understood without acknowledging its growing importance to the AI economy.\n\nAs AI data-center construction accelerates and chip demand rises, he argues the metal has effectively become \"another AI play.\"\n\nIndustry association The Silver Institute and Oxford Economics reinforced that view in a report released on Tuesday, saying AI's rapid expansion is helping drive growing demand for silver across digital economy applications.\n\n\"As digitalisation and AI adoption accelerate, so too does the demand for critical materials involved in their applications — silver a critical one among them,\" they wrote.\n\nData centers increasingly rely on next-generation chips such as GPUs and TPUs equipped with high-performance semiconductors that use silver in their internal connections and packaging, the association wrote.\n\nAnd as AI moves into autonomous vehicles, robotics, and edge devices, the broader electronics ecosystem is set to draw even more heavily on silver-rich components.\n\nBeyond AI demand, silver remains entrenched in a tight market, with inventories strained and borrowing rates still high despite some easing after October's historic squeeze.\n\n\"This is unquestionably a tight market, stocks are falling, and traders want whatever scraps of silver they can get their hands on,\" wrote Chris Weston, the head of research at Pepperstone, in a Tuesday note.\n\nHe added that retail traders are taking sharp notice of silver's surge, and for good reason.\n\n\"It is an emphatic move, with trend and momentum accounts absolutely bossing the show,\" wrote Weston.\n\nDespite its red-hot rally, the silver trade remains a risky one, Goldman Sachs cautioned in October.\n\nSilver is far more cyclical because of its heavy industrial use, making it a less reliable hedge than gold, the bank said. It also lacks the support of central-bank buying that underpins the yellow metal, Goldman added.",

    "fullText": "The Sporting News 2025 High School Football Top 25 — Week 18: December 9 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe run is finally over for the IMG Academy [Bradenton, FL] Ascenders as the No. 1 team in The Sporting News High School Football Top 25 as they give way to the new SN No. 1 Buford [GA] Wolves.\n\nEven worse for the Ascenders, with two undefeated top 5 teams squaring off for Georgia's GHSA Class 6A state championship next week, there's no viable path left for them to climb back into the No. 1 spot. Therefore, they've been officially eliminated from contention for the title of The Sporting News High School Football National Champions.\n\nFor now, the Ascenders settle into the No. 2 spot in The SN Top 25, but they still have to hold off several other teams in order to maintain that position. That includes the SN No. 3 Southlake [TX] Carroll Dragons, SN No. 4 St. Frances Academy [Baltimore, MD] Panthers,SN No. 5 Carrollton [GA] Trojans, and SN No. 6 Allen [TX] Eagles. Any of those teams that win all of their remaining games will also pass IMG Academy in the rankings.\n\nIMG Academy has one remaining hope at clinching a share of the national title. If they can maintain a high enough position in each of the selector lists that are used to compile The Sporting News Composite Rankings, they could theoretically collect enough points there to hold onto the No. 1 position. Currently, they are ranked behind Buford on that list, too, but it's unclear what effect a Wolves' loss to the Carrollton [GA] Trojans would have in that Georgia Class 6A title tilt.\n\nFor now, the Ascenders can only wait and hope that they've done enough.\n\nLike any set of rankings, things may not always make sense at first glance, and there are as many approaches to ranking teams as there are selectors. Some rankings are simply a reflection of what has happened to date, and many of these are algorithm-based, subject to wild weekly swings like the Massey Ratings that are part of The Sporting News Composite Rankings released on Wednesdays.\n\nOther rankings are more predictive – an attempt to account for what has happened, while attempting to line up teams in a way that will reflect potential future results. SN's approach falls somewhere in line with this way of thinking, and each week we first attempt to rank the teams by resume before considering wins and losses and head-to-head results. No system is perfect, but at least understanding our approach can help understand why we have the teams where we do.\n\nAs noted above, Buford has overtaken the previous No. 1 IMG Academy, and the Wolves are a win away from the school's first national championship.\n\nMORE NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL HEADLINES\n\nHow the nation's top teams fared last week including the teams ranked in our composite rankings\n\n2025 Record: 14-0\nLast Week: SN No. 2\n\nNext Game: 12/16/2025 — vs. No. 3/SN No. 5 Carrollton [GA] Trojans\nLast Game: 12/5/2025 — Buford 39, NR Valdosta [GA] Wildcats 7 (12-2)\nW/L Streak: 14 wins\n\nBuford has finally climbed the Top 25 mountain. Now, the question is ... can they stay there? The Wolves are the nation's new No. 1 team, moving ahead of the IMG Academy Ascenders by virtue of a 39-7 win over the Valdosta [GA] Wildcats – a team with a national championship pedigree of its own. Historically, the Wildcats are the Peach State's most successful program at the national level with at least six mythical national titles dating back to 1962. That's good enough to rank fourth in the nation all-time, so it's fitting that the Wolves' potential path to the title went through Valdosta. Now, the Wolves will face the SN No. 5 Carrollton Trojans for a chance to add their name to Georgia's small list of high school football national champions. It's the biggest game in Buford's school history next Tuesday night, and the stakes couldn't be any bigger.\n\n2025 Record: 9-0\nLast Week: SN No. 1\n\nNext Game: Season has concluded\nLast Game: 11/1/2025 — IMG Academy 31, NR Hun [Princeton, NJ] Raiders 13 (7-4)\nW/L Streak: 10 wins\n\nIMG Academy has finally fallen out of the No. 1 position here, and as noted above, there's no viable path remaining for them to regain this position. If anything, they are likely to slip even further, pending results of the four teams lined up directly below them in the rankings. And their only hope of a national title at this point is via the SN Composite Rankings or via one of the other national title selectors.\n\n2025 Record: 14-0\nLast Week: SN No. 4\n\nNext Game: 12/13/2025 — vs. No. 31 DeSoto [TX] Eagles (11-3)\nLast Game: 12/6/2025 — Southlake Carroll 51, NR Guyer [Denton, TX] Wildcats 19 (11-3)\nW/L Streak: 14 wins\n\nAfter fending off a feisty Prosper [TX] Eagles' squad two weeks ago, it was back to the blowouts last week as the Dragons dismantled the Guyer Wildcats. Next up is a DeSoto team that has had its up and downs, but as been riding the highs for several weeks now. This one could be a doozy, and it has the potential to knock Carroll out of the national title picture.\n\n2025 Record: 8-1\nLast Week: SN No. 3\n\nNext Game: 12/10/2025 — vs. NR Corner Canyon [Draper, UT] Chargers (12-1)\nLast Game: 11/1/2025 — St. Frances Academy 35, The St. James Performance Academy [Springfield, VA] Strivers 0 (8-1)\nW/L Streak: 7 wins\n\nSt. Frances Academy has been idle for almost six weeks, but it's finally game week again as the Panthers will take on the Corner Canyon [Draper, UT] Chargers Wednesday night at home in Baltimore in the Overtime Nationals Championship. The game is being billed as a national championship game, but neither the Panthers nor the Chargers remains in contention for the title here in SN's rankings.\n\n2025 Record: 14-0\nLast Week: SN No. 5\n\nNext Game: 12/16/2025 — vs. No. 1/SN No. 1 Buford [GA] Wolves (14-0)\nLast Game: 12/5/2025 — Carrollton 48, NR North Gwinnett [Suwanee, GA] Bulldogs 21 (12-2)\nW/L Streak: 14 wins\n\nCarrollton gets a weekend off, but they'll be busy preparing for their game against No. 1 Buford. The Wolves are guaranteed a national title if they win it; for Carrollton, it's a little shakier with No. 3 Southlake Carroll still ahead of them and in contention for a Texas UIL Class 6A Division II title. It may come down to how the game looks on the field, but either way, it's a game that will help paint the national championship picture here at The Sporting News.\n\n2025 Record: 14-0\nLast Week: SN No. 6\n\nNext Game: 12/13/2025 — vs. No. 18/SN No. 12 Duncanville [TX] Panthers (11-1)\nLast Game: 12/5/2025 — Allen 33, SN No. 25 North Crowley [Fort Worth, TX] Panthers 21 (12-2)\nW/L Streak: 14 wins\n\nFor Allen, the dream of a Sporting News national title is officially over with four teams still ahead of them in the rankings, including Buford and Carrollton, who will face off as noted in Georgia's Class 6A title game. The winner of that is guaranteed to stay ahead of Allen in The SN Top 25 so there is no viable path to the national title here. But, the Eagles are very much alive and in the running for the Texas UIL Class 6A Division I title. They knocked off the defending state champion North Crowley Panthers last week, and next up, is another group of Panthers eager to claim the trophy for their own case. This one could be epic.\n\n2025 Record: 13-1\nLast Week: SN No. 7\n\nNext Game: Season has concluded\nLast Game: 11/28/2025 — SN No. 10 Carrollton [GA] Trojans 34 (13-0), Grayson 14\nW/L Streak: 1 loss\n\nIt was an admirable run for Grayson. After losing their 5-star QB Travis Burgess for the season back in August, they turned the reins over to Deuce Smith who guided the Rams all the way to Georgia's Class 6A quarterfinals. It ended there, and with it, Grayson lost its best chance yet to capture an elusive national title. The good news for the Rams is they'll probably be right back in the thick of it again next year. But that's little consolation right now for a team that had a title within reach.\n\n2025 Record: 13-1\nLast Week: SN No. 8\n\nNext Game: 12/11/2025 — vs. NR Lakeland [FL] Dreadnaughts (12-2)\nLast Game: 12/5/2025 — St. Thomas Aquinas 45, NR Riverdale [Fort Myers, FL] Raiders 13 (12-2)\nW/L Streak: 13 wins\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas will play for Florida's FHSAA Class 5A state championship Thursday night against Lakeland in a rematch of last year's finale. That didn't go so well for the Dreadnaughts who lost their only game of the 2024 season in a 34-0 rout at the hands of the Raiders. And they'll be hard-pressed to overcome this edition of Florida's Class 5A juggernauts, too.\n\n2025 Record: 11-1\nLast Week: SN No. 9\n\nNext Game: Season has concluded\nLast Game: 11/25/2025 — Bishop Gorman 44, NR Arbor View [Las Vegas, NV] Aggies 7 (9-3)\nW/L Streak: 7 wins\n\nBishop Gorman throttled the Arbor View Aggies in Nevada's Open Division state championship game. It wasn't enough to lift them into the national title conversation, but the Gaels will be back next year for another run at national glory.\n\n2025 Record: 11-0\nLast Week: SN No. 11\n\nNext Game: Season has concluded\nLast Game: 11/23/2025 — DeMatha 20, NR Gonzaga [Washington, DC] Eagles 13 (7-5)\nW/L Streak: 21 wins\n\nDeMatha captured the WCAC championship in a hard-fought win over the Gonzaga Eagles. It should be enough to keep them here in the national Top 10 when the dust settles on the playoffs around the rest of the country.\n\n2025 Record: 13-0\nLast Week: SN No. 11\n\nNext Game: 12/13/2025 — vs. NR St. Augustine [New Orleans, LA] Purple Knights (12-1)\nLast Game: 12/5/2025 — Edna Karr 17, NR Catholic [Baton Rouge, LA] Bears 10 (10-3)\nW/L Streak: 27 wins\n\nIt's likely that the best game of Louisiana's Division I Select bracket has already been played; Edna Karr's close call against the Catholic Bears last week resulted in only the Cougars' second one-score game of the season. The first came against the American Heritage [Plantation, FL] Patriots back on September 12 in The Sporting News High School Football Game of the Week. The Patriots ultimately stumbled to a 5-5 finish in the regular season, but have since rebounded to make it to Florida's FHSAA Class 4A state championship game this week. Those results could indicate that this Edna Karr team is a little over-ranked at this point, and they'll have to hold off some undefeated Texas squads lined up behind them here in the Top 25. In the meantime, they can only take care of their own business, and this week, that means a rematch with St. Augustine in the state championship game – a team they beat 42-21 back on October 3. That's the Purple Knights' only loss to date, but we expect their loss column to double by the end of Saturday's matchup with the Cougars.\n\n2025 Record: 11-1\nLast Week: SN No. 12\n\nNext Game: 12/13/2025 — vs. SN No. 6 Allen [TX] Eagles\nLast Game: 12/6/2025 — Duncanville 35, NR Waxahachie [TX] Indians 27 (11-3)\nW/L Streak: 10 wins\n\nDuncanville's only loss this season is a 28-27 setback against Waxahachie way back on September 19. They avenged that loss last Saturday in the playoffs, holding off a furious Indians' rally to snag a 35-27 victory and move on to the state semifinals. Now, their redemption tour continues against No. 6 Allen – a team that just beat the defending state champions form North Crowley. We can't wait to see how this one plays out.\n\n2025 Record: 14-0\nLast Week: SN No. 13\n\nNext Game: 12/12/2025 — vs. NR Lone Star [Frisco, TX] Rangers (14-0)\nLast Game: 12/5/2025 — Aledo 43, NR Ryan [Denton, TX] Raiders 17 (12-2)\nW/L Streak: 14 wins\n\nTwo 14-0 squads will face off when Aledo meets Lone Star Friday night on neutral ground in Mansfield, Texas, and Aledo's championship pedigree – 11 state titles since 2009 – suggests that the Bearcats will be tough to beat. But Lone Star beat another championship program last week in their 58-38 takedown of the Highland Park [Dallas, TX] Scots, and the only way to settle a matchup like this is on the field. We lean toward Aledo, but this Lone Star squad has brought it every week in 2025.\n\n2025 Record: 14-0\nLast Week: SN No. 14\n\nNext Game: 12/12/2025 — vs. NR Boerne [TX] Greyhounds (13-1)\nLast Game: 12/5/2025 — Randle 45, NR Iowa Colony [TX] Pioneers 35 (12-2)\nW/L Streak: 30 wins\n\nRandle has survived two shootouts with Iowa Colony this year, and the gut feel here is that the Lions will have an easier go of it this week against a one-loss Boerne Greyhounds' squad that had its hands full with in a 56-49 shootout win over the Alamo Heights [San Antonio, TX] Mules last week.\n\n2025 Record: 10-3\nLast Week: No. 15\n\nNext Game: 12/13/2025 — vs. NR De La Salle [Concord, CA] Spartans (12-0)\nLast Game: 11/28/2025 — vs. SN No. 3 Centennial [Corona, CA] Huskies (11-1)\nW/L Streak: 5 wins\n\nIt's state championship bowl week in California, and the Santa Margarita Eagles will look to put a bow on their 2025 season against the undefeated former kings of California from De La Salle. Don't let the records fool you – this 10-3 Santa Margarita team is actually the favorite headed into this game, and we expect they'll emerge victorious with a California state title in their first season under Eagles' alum and Heisman Trophy winner Carson Palmer.\n\n2025 Record: 11-2\nLast Week: SN No. 16\n\nNext Game: Season has concluded\nLast Game: 11/28/2025 — SN No. 25 Santa Margarita [Rancho Santa Margarita, CA] Eagles (10-3) 42, Centennial 7\nW/L Streak: 1 loss\n\nThere was only one team Centennial couldn't beat in 2025, and unfortunately, they had to face them twice. In a season when the Huskies finally beat their nemesis Mater Dei twice, they also suffered two losses of their own to one team as Santa Margarita beat them, 33-27, in overtime on August 28 before blowing them out, 42-7, last in the Southern Section championship at the Rose Bowl. That second loss ended the Huskies' season, unfortunately, and they'll spend the offseason ruing their inability to avenge that earlier loss to Santa Margarita.\n\n2025 Record: 14-0\nLast Week: SN No. 17\n\nNext Game: 12/12/2025 — vs. NR Clayton [NC] Comets (12-2)\nLast Game: 12/4/2025 — Grimsley 13, NR Weddington [Matthews, NC] Warriors 7 (13-1)\nW/L Streak: 30 wins\n\nWe suspected Weddington would put up a good fight against Grimsley, and they did, losing just 13-7 last Thursday night. But for Grimsley, a win's a win, and now they'll take on the Clayton Comets in North Carolina's NCHSAA Class 7A state championship game Friday night.\n\n2025 Record: 8-3\nLast Week: SN No. 18\n\nNext Game: Season has concluded\nLast Game: 11/21/2025 — SN No. 3 Centennial [Corona, CA] Huskies (11-1) 28, Mater Dei 27\nW/L Streak: 1 loss\n\nThe Monarchs have finally, officially, abdicated their throne, and it came much earlier than anybody could have expected for a program that entered the season as the unanimous No. 1 team in the country. Mater Dei's loss to Centennial ended their back-to-back run of national titles, but ultimately, the Monarchs will be fine in the long run. They have the best talent in the country in any given year, and they've got a lot of young prospects who should be able to right the ship pretty quickly.\n\n2025 Record: 9-2\nLast Week: SN No. 19\n\nNext Game: Season has concluded\nLast Game: 11/14/2025 — NR Orange [CA] Lutheran Lancers 20 (3-8), St. John Bosco 19\nW/L Streak: 2 losses\n\nAfter a flashy 9-0 start that carried them into the No. 1 position in the SN Top 25, the Braves' season only lasted two more games. First, there was the loss to archrival Mater Dei in the regular-season finale. Then on a rainy Friday night in Southern California, the Braves were ousted from California's Southern Section playoffs in one of the most shocking postseason results in Golden State history. A season that once appeared destined to end in another national championship for St. John Bosco terminated instead in the opening round of California's postseason, and the Braves will spend the offseason assessing how it all unraveled so quickly.\n\n2025 Record: 13-1\nLast Week: SN No. 20\n\nNext Game: 12/12/2025 — vs. NR Melissa [TX] Cardinals (13-1)\nLast Game: 12/5/2025 — South Oak Cliff 28, NR Port Neches [TX]-Groves Indians 0 (13-1)\nW/L Streak: 12 wins\n\nThe Bears had no problem against the previously undefeated Port Neches-Groves Indians last week, and they won't have any issues this coming Friday night against the Melissa Cardinals. We're expecting them to roll and set up a meeting with Randle – a rematch of 2024's Texas UIL Class 5A Division II title game.\n\n2025 Record: 13-0\nLast Week: SN No. 21\n\nNext Game: Season has concluded\nLast Game: 12/6/2025 — Bixby 31, NR Owasso [OK] Rams 17 (10-3)\nW/L Streak: 16 wins\n\nBixby got a little bit of a fight from Owasso last Saturday, but it takes more than that to take down this group of Spartans who are now Oklahoma's OSSAA Class 6A Division I champions.\n\n2025 Record: 12-0\nLast Week: SN No. 22\n\nNext Game: Season has concluded\nLast Game: 12/4/2025 — Baylor 28, NR Brentwood [TN] Academy Eagles 24 (11-1)\nW/L Streak: 12 wins\n\nBaylor and Brentwood Academy put on quite a show in the rain, but in the end, it was the Red Raiders' night in what was the Red Raiders' season. They are your Tennessee TSSAA Division II-AAA state champions.\n\n2025 Record: 14-0\nLast Week: No. 23\n\nNext Game: 12/15/2025 — vs. NR Benedictine [Savannah, GA] Cadets (11-2)\nLast Game: 12/5/2025 — Creekside 35, NR Kell [Marietta, GA] Longhorns 6 (11-3)\nW/L Streak: 14 wins\n\nCreekside is one win away from being crowned Georgia's GHSA Class 4A state champions, and they've yet to play a game closer than 20 points this year. Benedictine didn't get here by laying down and surrendering to anybody, but we also expect they'll find this Seminoles' team to be a little beyond their reach.\n\n2025 Record: 15-0\nLast Week: SN No. 24\n\nNext Game: Season has concluded\nLast Game: 12/5/2025 — Clay-Chalkville 38, NR Saraland [AL] Spartans 21 (13-1)\nW/L Streak: 15 wins\n\nClay-Chalkville finished off a perfect season last Friday night in a 38-21 win over Saraland, and they conclude the 2025 season as the top-ranked team in Alabama as the AHSAA Class 6A champions.\n\n2025 Record: 12-0\nLast Week: Unranked\n\nNext Game: 12/13/2025 — vs. Santa Margarita [Rancho Santa Margarita, CA] Eagles (10-3)\nLast Game: 12/21/2025 — De La Salle 24, Pittsburg [CA] Pirates (11-3)\nW/L Streak: 10 wins\n\nDe La Salle hasn't seen the field in three weeks, waiting on California's Southern Section to be decided. They are 12-0, but it will take all they've got and then some to beat this 10-3 Santa Margarita. They'll likely have to do it by playing a defensive battle because it's unlikely they could score enough in a shootout against this Eagles' defense that might be the best in the country.\n\nSN No. 4 St. Frances Academy [Baltimore, MD] Panthers vs. NR Corner Canyon [Draper, UT] Chargers (12-1) — 7 p.m. EST local\n\nSN No. 8 St. Thomas Aquinas [Fort Lauderdale, FL] Raiders (13-1) vs. NR Lakeland [FL] Dreadnaughts (12-2) — 7:30 p.m. EST local\n\nSN No. 13 Aledo [TX] Bearcats (13-0) vs. NR Lone Star [Frisco, TX] Rangers — 8 p.m. EST (7 p.m. CST local)\n\nSN No. 14 Randle [Richmond, TX] Lions (13-0) vs. NR Boerne [TX] Greyhounds (13-1) — 8 p.m. EST (7 p.m. CST local)\n\nSN No. 17 Grimsley [Greensboro, NC] Whirlies (14-0) vs. NR Clayton [NC] Comets (12-2) — 8 p.m. EST local\n\nSN No. 20 South Oak Cliff [Dallas, TX] Bears (12-1) vs. NR Melissa [TX] Cardinals (13-1) — 8:30 p.m. EST (7:30 p.m. CST local)\n\nSN No. 3 Southlake [TX] Carroll Dragons (13-0) vs. NR DeSoto [TX] Eagles (11-3) — 3 p.m. EST (2 p.m. CST local)\n\nSN No. 6 Allen [TX] Eagles vs. SN No. 12 Duncanville [TX] Panthers (11-1) — 4 p.m. EST (3 p.m. CST local)\n\nSN No. 11 Edna Karr [New Orleans, LA] Cougars (13-0) vs. NR St. Augustine [New Orleans, LA] Purple Knights (12-1) — 4:30 p.m. EST (3:30 p.m. CST local)\n\nSN No. 15 Santa Margarita [Rancho Santa Margarita, CA] Eagles (10-3) vs. SN No 25 De La Salle [Concord, CA] Spartans (12-0) — 11 p.m. EST (8 p.m. PST local)\n\nSN No. 23 Creekside [Fairburn, GA] Seminoles (14-0) vs. NR Benedictine [Savannah, GA] Cadets (11-2) — 7 p.m. EST local\n\nSN No. 1 Buford [GA] Wolves (14-0); SN No. 2 IMG Academy [Bradenton, FL] Ascenders (9-0); SN No. 5 Carrollton [TX] Trojans (14-0); SN No. 7 Grayson [Loganville, GA] Rams (12-1); SN No. 9 Bishop Gorman [Las Vegas, NV] Gaels (11-1); SN No. 10 DeMatha [Hyattsville, MD] Stags (11-0); SN No. 16 Centennial [Corona, CA] Huskies (11-2); SN No. 18 Mater Dei [Santa Ana, CA] Monarchs (8-3); SN No. 19 St. John Bosco [Bellflower, CA] Braves (9-2); SN No. 21 Bixby [OK] Spartans (13-0); SN No. 22 Baylor [Chattanooga, TN] Red Raiders (12-0); SN No. 24 Clay-Chalkville [Pinson, AL] Cougars (15-0)\n\nMORE HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PLAYOFF HEADLINES\n\nFlorida 2025 playoff brackets (7A/6A/5A/4A)\n\nGeorgia 2025 playoff brackets (6A/5A/4A)\n\nLouisiana 2025 playoff brackets (Division I/II)\n\nOklahoma 2025 playoff brackets (6A/5A/4A)\n\nTexas 2025 playoff brackets (6A/5A/4A)",

    "description": "LPGA winners Ryann O'Toole, Hinako Shibuno and Jodi Ewart Shadoff all re-earn their full playing privileges in Q-Series Final",
    "fullText": "Ryann O’Toole didn’t imagine she would put this on her December itinerary, but there she was playing golf in Alabama this past week trying to salvage her LPGA Tour card. It was a wise decision.\n\nThe 38-year-old O’Toole, a UCLA alum who first gained recognition as a competitor on Golf Channel’s “Big Break,” has won one tournament on tour, and she has the chance to add more titles after shooting a bogey-free 65 with seven birdies on Tuesday in the final round of LPGA Q-Series Final Qualifying in Mobile. In the event shortened from 90 holes to 72 because of a day lost to bad weather, O’Toole finished tied for third at 11 under and was the top American qualifier. The top 25 and ties earned their tour card, with 31 golfers being the final total at Robert Trent Jones Trail Magnolia Grove.\n\nO’Toole has 20 career top-10s, but she made the cut in only half her 16 starts in 2025, with no top-10s, and finished 137th on the CME Points Rankings.\n\n“The last time I was here [at Q-Series] was 2014, and I told myself after that week, I never want to have to be back,” O’Toole said. “But you never know what happens, and here I was back having to re-qualify. It's stressful, it's a grind, it's mentally and emotionally draining. Then this week, with just the weather, I mean it being freezing, the delays, the rain, every single morning was early. … It became a physical grind.\n\n“I just think there's so much emotion that goes into this that it is a tough week. With 15 years on tour, there are mixed emotions going into it. I wasn't sure if I was even going to decide to go back to Q School or if I was just going to start the next chapter of my life. But at the same time it would be really weird to start January 1 and go, ‘What do you mean I don't have full status? What do you mean? I'm not a professional on the LPGA?’ That wasn't OK for me.”\n\nGerman golfer Helen Briem earned her LPGA Tour card in impressive fashion. She shot a four-under 68 to earn medalist honors at 13 under. Briem, 20, moves to the LPGA after having played on the Ladies European Tour.\n\n“Right now, I'm a bit lost for words. I entered this week with not a lot of expectations,” said Brie. “But, overall, I'm really happy that I am able to play LPGA next year, and that’s really cool.”\n\nMajor winner Hinako Shibuno, arguably the most popular Japanese golfer, got her tour card back again, too. The 2019 AIG Women’s British Open champion made it on the number at five under after closing with a 72. Shibuno, 27, struggled on the LPGA this season, making just 10 cuts in 23 starts while notching only one top-10 finish.\n\nAnother veteran to re-earn her card is former European Solheim Cup player Jodi Ewart Shadoff. The 37-year-old, who won her lone LPGA title in 2022 and has top-10 finishes in three of the tour’s five majors, shot 71 and was among the final eight players who tied for 24th.\n\nAmong the notable players who missed getting their cards was 17-year-old Floridian Gianna Clemente, who turned pro this year, advanced through Second Stage and fell three shots off the cut. Kim Kaufman, 34, who battled breast cancer this year and finished chemotherapy in the summer, finished at four over. Among the past college stars who didn’t get their cards were 2023 U.S. Women’s Amateur champion and Auburn alum Megan Schofill (even par), 2024 NCAA individual champion Adela Cernousek of Texas A&M (16 over), USC’s Amari Avery (one under) and Wake Forest’s Rachel Kuehn (eight over).",

    "description": "The Zac Taylor hot seat conversation is back.",
    "fullText": "The Cincinnati Bengals remain on track to miss the playoffs once again, which means the conversation about the Zac Taylor hot seat has fired up in a big way.\n\nIt didn’t take long for the topic to surface, either, given the loss in Buffalo that snatched hope from the franchise about the playoffs just as quickly as Joe Burrow’s return provided it.\n\nTechnically speaking, the Bengals aren’t mathematically eliminated from the playoffs right now. But the Bengals need a miracle in the form of help while also winning out.\n\nIf and when the Bengals do miss the playoffs, that will mean the Bengals have missed the playoffs five times over the course of Taylor’s seven years as head coach.\n\nSome of those years were spent rebuilding, of course, and the playoff appearances led to AFC title game appearances at a minimum.\n\nEven so, the luster of those big moments continues to fade, hence the conversation about Taylor’s hot seat this upcoming offseason.\n\nTODAY’s loss was not Zac Taylor’s fault.\n\nBUT… the reason that today’s loss was season-ending IS 100% Zac Taylor’s fault.\n\nZac Taylor lost us the Broncos, Lions, Steelers, Bears, and Jets games, among others. \n\nZAC TAYLOR NEEDS TO GO.\n\n— AndreBengals (@AndreBengals) December 7, 2025\n\nThe Bengals will at best have four full years between playoff games.

It was a wild affair with many ups and downs for both fighters, but in the end, Royval was able to out-slug and outlast Taira to win a close, split decision. It was one hell of a fight that won the Fight of the Night award.\n\nYou can watch Royval's gutsy win over Taira in the video above.\n\nRoyval (17-8 MMA, 7-4 UFC) is scheduled to get back into action this Saturday in the main event of UFC Fight Night 266 (ESPN+), which takes place at the UFC Apex in Las Vegas.

Connor Clifton is back in the game lineup and Arturs Silovs gets his first start since November 29th.\n\nTonight's lineup vs. the Ducks.#LetsGoPens pic.twitter.com/hId0VXXwHi\n\n— Pittsburgh Penguins (@penguins) December 9, 2025\n\nThe visiting, but still very loudly orange Anaheim Ducks have this lineup for the night:\n\nHere's who we fly with. #FlyTogether pic.twitter.com/xKADvUaTDl\n\n— Anaheim Ducks (@AnaheimDucks) December 10, 2025\n\nThe two teams have no problems trading end-to-end rushes and lots of shots and chances early. The first goal, however, comes on a bit of a broken play- Heinen got kicked out of the face off circle and Noel Acciari moved in as a replacement. The faceoff was a 50/50 play that Connor Dewar was able to direct back to Acciari with his skate. Acciari used the bounce to quickly fling a shot in goal, and it sailed right on by Ville Husso, thanks to the screen from Dewar and the Duck defending him. 1-0 Pens.\n\n🍪🚨 pic.twitter.com/Z4wK0F7CXI\n\n— Pittsburgh Penguins (@penguins) December 10, 2025\n\nJustin Brazeau is tripped, the Pens get the game’s first power play but can’t capitalize on it. Soon after that penalty ends, Dewar is cross-checked to give the Pens another chance, again they don’t do much with it in terms of generating chances.\n\nEnd of the first, 16-8 are the shots in favor of Pittsburgh.\n\nPittsburgh can’t score on the carryover power play and get a few other very close calls, can’t get the puck over the line again. Anaheim uses that to tie the game up. The Ducks win an offensive zone faceoff and defenseman Jackson Lacombe skates right by Bryan Rust. With almost no angle left, Lacombe lifts a shot way high that banks in off Silovs and into the net. 1-1 game.\n\nTalk about scoring from a sharp angle 📐 pic.twitter.com/KBPWGLx6iS\n\nThe Pens get a third power play, again no good. Ville Koivunen somehow avoids a hooking penalty despite going water skiing on a backcheck. Instead the refs call Heinen for a minor a bit later to give Anaheim a second crack at their power play. Pittsburgh kills that off but the Ducks are still able to find the next goal. Rust, Crosby and Karlsson all have opportunities to clear the puck, none can and before you know it Troy Terry has the puck on his stick and he quickly goes top shelf on Silovs. 2-1 ANA.\n\n🚨 Terry 🚨\n\nThe T stands for Top shelf! \nWe lead 2-1! #FlyTogether pic.twitter.com/DPkUoIk33i\n\n— Anaheim Ducks (@AnaheimDucks) December 10, 2025\n\nTommy Novak becomes a focal point late in the period, nearly scoring on a shot/pass with Crosby at the backdoor and the puck hitting Husso’s pads and somehow not trickling in. Novak creates better luck when he shoots from in tight, collects his rebound and even though his momentum took him behind the net Novak was able to quickly sling the puck off the back of Husso and in. 2-2 to go into intermission.\n\nShots are 29-18 PIT overall in the game, but the score is tied up 2-2.\n\nSome tied third periods teams are virtually watching the clock to get to overtime. This was not one of those games. Both teams were fine with trading odd man rushes and skating the puck as quickly as they could to generate offense.\n\nTowards the end of the period it was the Pens’ third line of young players that again amped up the pressure in a major way. A collision between Kris Letang and Radko Gudas left Gudas smarting and at times doubled over in pain. The Duck defenders were tiring and Husso had a to grab a stick to help his cause. The refs actually call the penalty on the goalie, late in the third period. Surprising, but warranted. Wouldn’t you know, the Pens power play comes through. It’s a very fortunate play, Anthony Mantha is centering the puck when Husso leans his stick out to try and break it up. Husso fails in a major way, turns out being bad luck for him to redirect the puck into his own net. 3-2 with just 3:55 to play.\n\nMANTHA BOUGHT EVERYBODY BIG MACS!\n\nHere's how to cash in your @McDonalds offer: https://t.co/QH7j1DPz1i pic.twitter.com/Ec13oX0OGf\n\n— Pittsburgh Penguins (@penguins) December 10, 2025\n\nAnaheim pulls their goalie, the Pens nearly score but can’t quite do it. Chris Kreider goes to the box for Anaheim with 17 seconds left and it seems like that should be about it for their chances. Turns out, it’s not. With time running down rookie Bennett Sennecke drives to the net. He swings in a desperation effort with one hand on his stick; more a centering pass than a shot. But the pucks hits off Karlsson’s glove and goes into the net with 0.1 seconds left. Unreal.\n\n🚨SENNECKE BEATS THE BUZZER!! 🚨\n\nWe tie the game with under 1 second left!#FlyTogether pic.twitter.com/CMYCB7T22J\n\n— Anaheim Ducks (@AnaheimDucks) December 10, 2025\n\nShocking goal to give up there with a game that should have been in the bag.\n\nThe Pens can’t score on the carryover power play, action goes back to 3v3. Kindel almost sets Letang up for a winner, Karlsson and Crosby make some magic but for some reason Connor Dewar is the third player out there with them at the time. Dewar has a wide open net but can only hit the post.\n\nPittsburgh uses their timeout to give the top players a breather. They come close, no cigar.\n\nNovak is the first up, his shot to the glove side is stopped by Husso.\n\nLeo Carlsson is up for Anaheim, a deke to the backhand works perfectly.\n\nCrosby goes for the Pens, shoots it right into the glove.\n\nTroy Terry takes his turn, shoots wide. Didn’t have much to shoot at.\n\nVille Koivunen comes in with speed, maybe a little too much as he runs out of space and barely gets a shot away. Doesn’t work.\n\nThe SNP broadcast mentioned this was the seventh straight game (highest active streak in league) for the Penguins to score a goal in the first period. Obvious but no less true that makes foe a great way to setup the rest of the game.\n\nThen again, with the Pens losing a lead in the third period for a third straight game, playing while ahead has proved to be a difficult proposition for them. Giving up the tying goal while on the power play with 0.1 seconds is a new low, even for them. It’s shuddering to think what new ways they’ll find to blow leads from here on out if this isn’t rock bottom in that category I don’t know what could be.\n\nThe Ducks are fun, but oh brother they don’t know how to defend a lick. Not sure how long they’re going to last near the top of the standings but they will be a great watch this season due to the wide-open style of play and all the quality young players that are figuring it out at the NHL level.\n\nMcGroarty’s getting close to a goal, love the way he’s grinding and his puck touches lately down by the net. You can tell it’s coming for him, three shots on goal in the first 8:34 of the game alone.\n\nThe whole line with McGroarty, Ville Koivunen and Ben Kindel has been aces. The Pens may have found something there, certainly for the foreseeable future. Nice players and complimentary skills blending together between that trio. Lots of players had great nights on the ol’ Corsi and expected goals outlook for the Pens given the way it played out, none better than those three who were at 27-11 in shot attempts and up 1.9 – 0.3 in expected goals while on the ice. Sadly, played it even in actuals.\n\n1 for 5 power play on the night that salvaged their efforts with the late (and somewhat fluky, if not fortunate) goal that they gave back in the game’s dying seconds. Gross night overall by the power play. It was o fer 5 since Evgeni Malkin has been hurt before that point. Replacing him and the whole unit strategy about who gets positioned where is all out of whack right now. By the second period power play it was Crosby out by the blueline passing harmlessly with Erik Karlsson and that’s not going to be the recipe for success. Team needs some work there to reconfigure things there.\n\nThe ice looked awful, puck was bouncing around and rolling a ton for both teams. Got worse as the night wore on. Ironically though the ice had nothing to do with the crazy bounces off goalies and defenders that caused goals late in the game.\n\nDon’t look now but that’s points in four straight games (and three goals in that stretch) for Novak. Nice for him to heat up, he’s up to five goals on the season. He’s streaky like that, now the only question will be how much hay can he make while the sun is shining? Nice to see a top-six winger step up and produce.\n\nSilovs hasn’t won a game since November 6th and he narrowly found a way to avoid breaking that streak. Moneypuck had expected goals at 7.03 – 1.88 in the Pens’ favor. Silovs gave up three and for being a big goalie he has a way to shrink away in the key moments (like the first and third goals of the game). At least by stopping 1 of 2 shootout efforts he somehow improved his stats in that metric.\n\nWell, at least the Pens tried new players for the shootout, but their over-arching problem of not having enough quality performers continues. They don’t have anyone who can reliably make the deke that Leo Carlsson did at the pace he did and then place a backhand shot to the top like that. Giving Novak a chance was a good move since he was a hot player and curling and dragging the puck all over, can’t knock using Koivunen either. The simple explanation, though frustrating, is that the Penguins are simply bound to lose more shootouts than they win until they acquire enough players who are good at that specific and toolsy skill. They don’t have it right now.\n\nOf course, a night like this shouldn’t have required a shootout in the first place. The Pens poured chances on Husso, but he stood tall. That’s pretty annoying considering he’s been waived and has played more AHL games than NHL games this season and isn’t particularly good, yet Pittsburgh made him look like a brick wall that stopped 45 out of 48 shots and was only beaten on a deception play (Acciari), a weird goal from behind the net (Novak) and a tough bounce (Mantha).\n\nWould have been nice to comeback with about 1:30 left on the 4v3 OT power play and seal the game up. Mantha had just scored a goal a few game minutes earlier so it’s tough to keep him off the ice in that situation but he looked like a fish out of water in that scenario. Easy to Monday Morning Quarterback it, but they needed someone for net-front to let Karlsson and Crosby create off the space opened up by that instead of Mantha hanging out by the blueline. Alas.\n\nFrustrating outcome, the Pens probably deserved a better result — but then again they got a little sloppy and were forced to pay for it too. They’ll need to shrug it off and get ready for the next one on Thursday against Montreal.",

    "fullText": "MADISON – This is a big offseason for the Wisconsin football team.\n\nThe Badgers have suffered two straight losing seasons. In order to avoid a third, the team is going to need to make some major acquisitions through the transfer portal. They will also say goodbye to some players who are in search of more playing time or a fresh start.\n\nHere is our running list of who is coming and going for the Badgers.\n\nThe transfer portal for football is open from Jan. 2-16, but some players have already announced their intention to transfer.\n\nGriffin announced his departure Dec. 9. He sat out the 2024 season, per NCAA transfer rules, and missed the final seven games of ’25 due to injury. The 6-4, 210-pound receiver caught one pass for 5 yards this season, but he showed the ability to be a quality red zone/jump ball threat during spring practice and fall camp and made 43 catches for 579 yards during his two seasons at Boston College. He has one year of eligibility remaining.\n\nThe backfield was crowded this season and with the Badgers’ top three rushers expected to return in 2026 it will be hard for a fourth back to get carries. Yacamelli's 38 carries this season were a career high. He finished fifth on the team with 128 rushing yards. He had 571 rushing yards and averaged 5.3 yards per carry in three seasons at UW. Yacameilli, who announced his decision on Dec. 9, has one year of eligibility remaining.\n\nThe native of Sydney, Australia, who announced his decision Dec. 6, was the Badgers’ starting punter in 2023 and ’24 and started the first half of the '25 season before redshirt freshman Sean West took over. During the second half of the season Bertrams was called on to punt near midfield where his touch and ability to pin opponents inside the 20 proved valuable. This season 18 of his 37 punts were downed inside the 20.\n\nMoss, a cousin of former Badgers star running back Brent Moss, redshirt this season. The 6-1, 194-pound defensive back who hails from Dumfries, Va., has four years of eligibility remaining. He announced his decision on Dec. 4.\n\nThe former four-star recruit never found his way on the field for the Badgers. The 5-10, 186-pound graduate of Bollingbrook High School near Chicago played five games for UW but didn’t have a catch. He has three years of eligibility remaining. He announced his decision on Dec. 4.\n\nThe 6-4, 234-pound outside linebacker from Shelby, Mich. announced his intention to transfer Dec. 2. He didn’t see any game action in two years. He has three years of eligibility remaining.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Wisconsin football transfer portal tracker. Who's going, arriving",

    "fullText": "Quarterback recruiting in the 2026 cycle was a breeze for Arizona State. It identified El Paso (Texas) Del Valle four-star quarterback Jake Fette as a top target and landed his commitment in September of 2024.\n\nThe Rivals top-100 prospect saw his stock soar heading into his senior season and that led to other high-profile programs checking in. Fette stayed solid with the Sun Devils, though, signing with the Big 12 program last week. He’s the No. 7 QB in the Rivals300.\n\nWith National Signing Day for the 2026 cycle now in the past, many are now getting a feel for the 2027 board. When looking at junior QBs, though, many are already committed. Of the top 25 signal-callers in the cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, 14 are pledged.\n\nAccording to the Rivals Recruiting Prediction Machine, Arizona State is trending for one of the top uncommitted 2027 QBs in the nation. Once again, he resides in the Lone Star State.\n\nBastrop (Texas) four-star QB Weston Nielsen told Rivals’ Sam Spiegelman at the end of September that no program was recruiting him harder than ASU. Now, Spiegelman has been joined by Rivals’ Steve Wiltfong, who logged a pick this month in favor of the Sun Devils landing Nielsen’s commitment.\n\nThe 6-foot-1, 175-pounder will announce his commitment this Saturday, Dec. 13. Arrows continue to point toward Tempe and Kenny Dillingham.\n\n“They still sit pretty high on my board after another visit,” Nielsen told Spiegelman this fall. “They are recruiting me the hardest. They were able to tell me about their program and why they are a good place to be. I definitely felt more connected with them when I left.”\n\nNielsen eclipsed 3,000 passing yards for the second season in a row this fall. Bastrop went 10-3 and the blue-chipper threw 44 touchdowns to just six interceptions. He also rushed for five scores and now has over 100 total TDs to his name at the high school level.\n\nNielsen is the No. 269 overall prospect and No. 20 QB in the 2027 cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, a weighted average that utilizes all major recruiting media companies. He’s also the No. 42 player in Texas.\n\nThe Sun Devils opened their 2027 class earlier this month by landing a pledge from Chino Hills (Calif.) Orange Lutheran four-star wide receiver Nico Bland. He checks in as the No. 188 recruit and No. 23 WR in the nation.\n\nAlong with Fette, ASU signed 18 other prospects and compiled the No. 35 class in the nation, according to the Rivals Industry Team Recruiting Rankings. The class can be seen here.",

    "description": "“When your plus-minus, and your offense and defense is where we’re at, we’re taking some strides. We understand there’s another level we can get to.”",
    "fullText": "At 15-6, the Houston Rockets have moved just past the quarter pole of the 82-game regular season. That total of six losses is tied for the second-fewest in the 2025-26 Western Conference.\n\nYet, the Rockets aren’t entirely satisfied. They rank second in the NBA in overall net rating (+10.8) and defensive rating, trailing only the defending champion Oklahoma City Thunder. They are fourth in offensive rating.\n\nOf those six losses, five were games that could have been won in the fourth quarter. Crunch-time execution, particularly in half-court situations, has been an occasional issue. So, with a team led by a pair of 2025 All-Stars in Kevin Durant and Alperen Sengun, the Rockets believe they’re capable of more.\n\nComing off Saturday’s short-handed loss at Dallas on night two of a split back-to-back, the Rockets are currently in a rare scheduling break, with their next game not coming until Thursday (home versus the Los Angeles Clippers).\n\nSo, in the aftermath of a stretch with five games in seven nights, head coach Ime Udoka allowed his weary team to take Sunday and Monday off, entirely.\n\nBut Tuesday, the Rockets were back at it inside their Houston practice facility, and team activities included both a film session and a competitive practice.\n\nSpeaking post-practice, Udoka offered this assessment to local reporters (via Space City Home Network, SCHN):\n\nIt’s always good to dive into what we’ve done, and look at some trends. And then, we attack those on the court.\n\nWe want to be great, but I think we’ve been good, overall. If you look at the record, 15-6, there are some positives there. But we also feel like we let some (games) slip away, so we’re trying to find the areas where we’ve grown or had some slippage in. Overall, it’s good, but we’re trying to be better than good.\n\nWhat we looked at, today, was where we were at after the first 10 games, and what was happening in the last 11. You see some good and bad trends, overall. But for the most part, when your plus-minus is where we’re at, and offense and defense is where we’re at, we’re taking some good strides. We understand there’s another level we can get to.\n\nAs far as identifying potential issues beyond crunch-time execution. the Rockets are also 0-2 on night two of back-to-backs and 15-4 in all other settings. Fortunately, they have only one back-to-back (at Denver and Sacramento on Dec. 20 and 21) remaining this month, and they hope to have additional roster reinforcements — namely, Tari Eason and Dorian Finney-Smith — before the volume of back-to-backs increases in January.\n\nThursday’s tipoff versus the Clippers (6-18) is at 7:00 p.m. Central from Toyota Center, and the game will be televised regionally on SCHN and nationally via NBA League Pass.\n\nMore: Tari Eason, Dorian Finney-Smith hope to rejoin Rockets in coming weeks\n\nIme Udoka meets with the media after the #Rockets returned to practice today\nThe team last played on Saturday the final game of 5 games in 7 days\nNext up the Clippers at home Thursday.@HoustonRockets I #AllFire pic.twitter.com/0odUbry02R\n\n— Space City Home Network (@SpaceCityHN) December 9, 2025\n\nThis article originally appeared on Rockets Wire: Ime Udoka: 15-6 Rockets are good, but striving for ‘better than good’",

    "description": "WBC lightweight champion Dubois is the latest addition to Paul's star-studded roster of women's boxing talent.",
    "fullText": "WBC lightweight champion Caroline Dubois is the latest addition to Most Valuable Promotion's star-studded roster of women's boxing talent. Dubois, 24, is considered to be one of the top rising stars of the female code and thus a key signing for Jake Paul's promotion, who aims to dominate that side of the sport.\n\nThere's no time to waste for the 2020 Olympian, who debuts for MVP in just 10 days when she defends her title against Camilla Panatta on the undercard of Paul's Netflix boxing match with Anthony Joshua on Dec. 19 in Miami.\n\n\"It was a decision that took a lot of thought,\" Dubois said Tuesday on Uncrowned's \"The Ariel Helwani Show\" about leaving her longtime promoter, Ben Shalom's BOXXER. \"It was a long process. We've been talking back and forth with [MVP co-founder] Nakisa [Bidarian], with the representatives from MVP, and it was just one of the moves that made the most sense. I'm at this point in my career where the sky's the limit, and there's such a massive ceiling, and there's so much on the line for myself.\n\n\"I want to become undisputed [champion]. I want to do this, I want to do that, and we have to make the decision in terms of what's going to be the best route to get me to where I want to be. MVP has signed up a lot of the females in my division. They're constantly putting the money where their mouth is, backing, supporting and investing in women's boxing, and I feel like it would've been stupid not to sign with them.\"\n\nDubois' previous promoter, BOXXER, lost its television deal with Sky Sports this past June, which allowed her to become a free agent and explore the market — although according to Dubois, that exploration went no further than speaking with MVP. The Brit said she rejected two prior offers from Paul's promotion but ultimately decided the third made by the American company was too good to turn down.\n\nNews of Dubois' impending exit from BOXXER was made apparent earlier this month when a clip of Shalom speaking about Dubois' status with the company gained traction on social media. Shalom claimed he was streamlining his talent stable and insinuated Dubois hadn't made the cut. However, Uncrowned understands — and Dubois confirmed — that BOXXER did offer her a renewal, which she declined.\n\n\"They did [try to re-sign me],\" Dubois said of BOXXER. \"Ben came with an offer, and they just couldn't compete with what MVP was offering. It's a shame, obviously, but I feel like I'm at this point right now where I need to be selfish and I need to think about what's going to push the Caroline Dubois train as far and as fast as it can go, and I feel like MVP is the best route for that.\"\n\n👀 Ben Shalom asked if Caroline Dubois is still a BOXXER fighter: \"We're in a situation now where we have to make decisions on who we can really invest in, who's going to sell the tickets, who's going to perform, who's going to do the big viewing numbers, and that's where we have… pic.twitter.com/pr77X2QNlD\n\n— EverythingBoxing | Darshan Desai (@EverythingBoxi2) December 2, 2025\n\n\"When I first read that — I'll be honest — the first reaction was to be slightly offended, because Ben did try very hard to re-sign me,\" Dubois added of Shalom's quote. \"I was actually sitting down in the living room with my sister when I first read the quote, watched the interview, and I was like, 'Oh, what's he trying to say?' I showed it to my sister, and I was like, 'Isn't that slightly offensive?' And she was like, 'Think about it from his point of view — what can he say?'\"\n\n\"Boxing is in such an interesting situation. All the promoters are trying to get at each other, they want to kick each other when they're down. Obviously me leaving him is going to be a soft spot for him. He tried to negate it and make it seem a different type of way. I understand why he said that, and I wish him the best. I believe if he's in it for the long run, he'll be able to come through whatever this dip is that he's going through right now. I'm not really upset by it anymore. It doesn't really matter to me. I'm focused on my own career, my own journey. I think you'll see that Caroline Dubois — she brings everything that [Shalom] says he is looking for. It's just unfortunately he can't bring what I'm looking for.\"\n\nDubois explained that a vital key to her decision to exit BOXXER was the company's switch from Sky Sports to the BBC, which is available in far more UK households but is paying a fraction of the rights fees and staging far fewer shows. MVP also houses two other champions at lightweight — Terri Harper and Stephanie Han — and has a host of big names Dubois can fight, including Alycia Baumgardner.\n\nIn Dubois' ideal world, she would unify with Harper first and then face the winner of Han vs. Holly Holm, which would put her in a prime position for a major fight against Baumgardner.\n\nMVP has a host of British talent but has yet to stage a show in the UK. Dubois expects 2026 to include MVP's expansion across the pond, where a fight between Dubois and Harper would be a perfect fit.\n\nBoth Dubois and Harper have been receptive to a unification fight, so it should be makeable with them both under the same banner. One match Dubois, however, doesn't think will be so easy to make is a fight with unified 130-pound champion Baumgardner, who has been dismissive of Dubois.\n\n\"100% she will [try to avoid the fight],\" Dubois said of Baumgardner. \"She will try to say, 'What has Caroline done? She's not on my level.' But if we're being honest, she needs me just as much as I need her. Women's boxing needs to have big fights happen. We're missing out on that, unfortunately. She needs to be involved in a big fight. She hasn't been involved in a big fight for a long time.\n\n\"I think me versus Alycia Baumgardner is a massive fight. I think it's the biggest fight in women's boxing. For that to happen, it needs to be built up, it needs to have the needle, it needs to have the belts on the line, and the way we can do that is by me unifying and collecting as many belts as I can. And I know that she wouldn't want to fight me unless I bring a massive dangling carrot to motivate her to get in the ring.\"",

    "fullText": "Ricky Saints cost Je'Von Evans the NXT Championship in his challenge against Oba Femi in the main event of \"WWE NXT.\"\n\nEvans interrupted Saints earlier in the show as the former champion sought a rematch for the title he had lost at Deadline. And given that Evans was the Iron Survivor coming out of the same event, he made the case that he should get the next opportunity at the title and didn't want to wait for New Year's Evil. Saints originally pushed back on the idea, but Evans appeared to talk him down and he stepped aside for Evans to challenge Femi in the main event.\n\nThe challenger went on to endure everything the champion could throw at him, getting the better of things on the outside of the ring before returning and seeming to have the match under wraps. He connected with his springboard cutter and went for what looked like the winning cover, only for the referee to be yanked from the ring before the three-count could be made.\n\nEvans turned to realize that it was Saints that had cost him, with them staring one another down as Femi got back to his feet. He clattered his challenger with a lariat, delivering the finishing powerbomb for the winning pinfall.\n\nAfter the match, Femi walked off with his title, confirming that it will be him going into this weekend's Saturday Night's Main Event against WWE Champion, Cody Rhodes. He gave a disapproving look to Saints, who simply shrugged it off and continued to smile at Evans defeated in the ring as the show went off air.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "description": "Award season is here",
    "fullText": "Postseason accolades are starting to roll across the country and on Tuesday the SEC announced that six Tigers were named to the All-Conference team as chosen by the league’s coaches.\n\nMansoor Delane and AJ Haulcy headline this year’s group, with both transfer DBs being named First-Team All-SEC. Sophomore tight end Trey’Dez Green was named to the second-team, while Harold Perkins, Damian Ramos, and Grant Chadwick all landed on the third-team.\n\nThis will be hopefully the first of many honors for Delane, who was named a finalist for the Thorpe Award. An All-American selection certainly appears to be in his future as well. Delane led the conference in passes defensed (13) and passes broken up (11), and per LSU he only allowed 13 receptions in 357 total pass coverage snaps.\n\nHaulcy gave LSU its best play at the safety position since Grant Delpit wore the purple and gold. Haulcy actually led the conference in tackles with 88 and also grabbed three interceptions this season.\n\nIf there was any type of bright spot for LSU’s anemic offense in 2025, it came in the form of Trey’Dez Green who had 29 receptions for 353 yards and a team-leading three touchdowns.\n\nConsidering Harold Perkins came into 2025 coming off an ACL tear, he had an excellent final season in Baton Rouge. Perkins had 56 tackles, led the Tigers with four sacks and tied for the team lead with eight TFLs. He also intercepted three passes and was credited with seven quarterback hurries. Perkins is no stranger to All-SEC honors, as he was voted Second-Team All-Conference in both 2o22 and 2023.\n\nYou may not realize it, but Damian Ramos is going to leave LSU as the most productive kicker in program history. Ramos broke the career field goal and scoring records this season, with 69 makes (nice……) and 404 points heading into the Texas Bowl. Ramos led the SEC this year with 24 field goals.\n\nGrant Chadwick quietly had one of the best punting seasons in school history. His 45.8 yards per punt was second best in the SEC this season and also the second-best in LSU history. Of his 54 punts this season, 21 went over 50 yards, and 18 of them were downed inside the 20. We all are hoping Lane Kiffin’s offense means we won’t see too much of Chadwick for the next couple of seasons, but if Kiffin does have to punt the ball away at least he’s got one of the best punters in the conference on his roster.",

    "fullText": "The Blue Jackets' woes in third periods remain issue, whether they're leading or tied.\n\nOnce again, a tight game in the third turned into a 4-1 rout for the Carolina Hurricanes that handed the Jackets a frustrating finale to an ugly road trip Dec. 9 at Lenovo Center in Raleigh, North Carolina. After taking a 1-0 lead on Dmitri Voronkov's power-play goal in the first, the Blue Jackets (13-11-6) leaned too heavily on goalie Jet Greaves (27 saves) and cracked under the Hurricanes' domination in the third.\n\nMore: Logan Thompson's mastery against Blue Jackets continues: Takeaways\n\nEric Robinson, who started his NHL career with the Blue Jackets, buried a shot under the crossbar off a pass from Taylor Hall at 7:53 of the third to break a 1-1 tie and give the Hurricanes (18-9-2) a 2-1 lead. Unlike Columbus, which had blown 10 third period leads in its first 28 games, Carolina made it stand up for 27-year old rookie goalie Brandon Bussi's ninth win in 10 starts.\n\nJordan Staal's power-play goal made it 3-1 with 6:22 left in the third and the Hurricanes cruised to a victory that included Jordan Martinook scoring the game's final goal into an empty net with 1:15 left.\n\nThe Blue Jackets lost all three games on a road trip that began with a wild 7-6 overtime loss Dec. 6 at the Florida Panthers in which they lost three separate leads, including 4-1 in the second period and 6-4 in the third. They were also shut out 2-0 by the Washington Capitals' Logan Thompson on Dec. 7 at Capital One Arena before coming to Raleigh to take their usual pounding from the Hurricanes.\n\nThe Blue Jackets, who will start a four-game homestand Dec. 11 against the Ottawa Senators, are stuck in last place of the Metropolitan Division and have a -11 goal differential that's also worst in their division. They're now 7-8-3 in road games and just 2-6-2 against division opponents.\n\nBlue Jackets reporter Brian Hedger can be reached at bhedger@dispatch.com and @BrianHedger.bsky.social\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Columbus Dispatch: Hurricanes finish strong to deal Blue Jackets a third straight loss",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nEveryone was a bit shocked when Shane Bieber opted in to his Toronto Blue Jays player option for $16 million for the 2026 season.\n\nNow, it makes a little more sense.\n\nThis is what The Athletic's Mitch Bannon reported in a new article on Tuesday:\n\n\"Bieber dealt with forearm fatigue at the end of the season, a person briefed on the matter said, but has since begun offseason recovery and rehab work. It’s not entirely clear if the forearm ailment entirely caused Bieber to pick up his player option and avoid the unknowns of free agency, but it likely factored into his decision.\"\n\nMORE: These 4 legends played in NFL, MLB, NHL as grandfathers before Philip Rivers\n\nBieber was widely expected to get a multi-year free agent contract for more than $20 million per season.\n\nIf he's healthy, the Blue Jays have an unexpected and wonderful bargain for the 2026 season.\n\nToronto traded for Bieber at the deadline from the Cleveland Guardians knowing that they'd likely just have him for the stretch run.\n\nBieber did play a big part in getting the Blue Jays to the World Series, and they made it all the way to extra innings in Game 7 before falling short to the Dodgers.\n\nBut the expectation was that would be that, and then Bieber would move on.\n\nMORE: A chicken sandwich at the Winter Meetings costs way more than you could imagine\n\nInstead, Bieber liked Toronto and found enough reason to just come back.\n\n\"The fit for Bieber with the Jays was obvious, but it didn’t seem likely that a return would come via his player option,\" Bannon writes. \"While with the Jays, the starting pitcher expressed how much he and his family enjoyed the city, and he rejoined a team that fell just short of a World Series title.\"\n\nNow, Bieber will hope to get healthy and then to try and run it back with the Blue Jays.\n\nDodgers' payroll is even more loaded with Edwin Diaz\n\nIt's a good day to remember Bob Feller's brilliance and his time in the U.S. Navy\n\nPete Alonso's free agency just came into the spotlight\n\nHow Aroldis Chapman is able to pitch for Great Britain in the WBC\n\nWhat the Kyle Schwarber signing means for the Pittsburgh Pirates\n\nPoetic paragraph reveals Cody Bellinger's free agent landing spots",

    "description": "Implant could restore lost senses, provide sensory feedback for prosthetic limbs",
    "fullText": "In a new leap for neurobiology and bioelectronics, Northwestern University scientists have developed a wireless device that uses light to send information directly to the brain — bypassing the body’s natural sensory pathways.\n\nThe soft, flexible device sits under the scalp but on top of the skull, where it delivers precise patterns of light through the bone to activate neurons across the cortex.\n\nIn experiments, scientists used the device’s tiny, patterned bursts of light to activate specific populations of neurons deep inside the brains of mouse models. (These neurons are genetically modified to respond to light.) The mice quickly learned to interpret these patterns as meaningful signals, which they could recognize and use. Even without touch, sight or sound involved, the animals received information to make decisions and successfully completed behavioral tasks.\n\nThe technology has immense potential for various therapeutic applications, including providing sensory feedback for prosthetic limbs, delivering artificial stimuli for future vision or hearing prostheses, modulating pain perception without opioids or systemic drugs, enhancing rehabilitation after stroke or injury, controlling robotic limbs with the brain and more.\n\nThe study will be published in the journal Nature Neuroscience.\n\n“Our brains are constantly turning electrical activity into experiences, and this technology gives us a way to tap into that process directly,” said Northwestern neurobiologist Yevgenia Kozorovitskiy, who led the experimental work. “This platform lets us create entirely new signals and see how the brain learns to use them. It brings us just a little bit closer to restoring lost senses after injuries or disease while offering a window into the basic principles that allow us to perceive the world.\n\n“Developing this device required rethinking how to deliver patterned stimulation to the brain in a format that is both minimally invasive and fully implantable,” said Northwestern bioelectronics pioneer John A. Rogers, who led the technology development. “By integrating a soft, conformable array of micro-LEDs — each as small as a single strand of human hair — with a wirelessly powered control module, we created a system that can be programmed in real time while remaining completely beneath the skin, without any measurable effect on natural behaviors of the animals. It represents a significant step forward in building devices that can interface with the brain without the need for burdensome wires or bulky external hardware. It’s valuable both in the immediate term for basic neuroscience research and in the longer term for addressing health challenges in humans.”\n\nKozorovitskiy is the Irving M. Klotz Professor of Neurobiology in Northwestern’s Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences. She also is a member of the Chemistry of Life Processes Institute. Rogers is the Louis Simpson and Kimberly Querrey Professor of Materials Science and Engineering, Biomedical Engineering and Neurological Surgery in the McCormick School of Engineering and Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. He also is the director of the Querrey Simpson Institute for Bioelectronics. Mingzheng Wu, a postdoctoral fellow in the Rogers and Kozorovitskiy laboratories, is the study’s first author.\n\nThe new study builds off previous work, in which Kozorovitskiy and Rogers introduced the first fully implantable, programmable, wireless, battery-free device capable of controlling neurons with light. Published in Nature Neuroscience in 2021, the previous study used a single micro-LED probe to influence social behavior in mice. While previous optogenetics (a method for controlling neurons with light) research required fiberoptic wires, which restrained mice, the wireless version allowed the animals to look and behave normally in social settings.\n\nThe new iteration takes this research a step further by enabling richer, more flexible communication with the brain. Going beyond the ability to activate and deactivate a single region of neurons, the new device features a programmable array of up to 64 micro-LEDs. With real-time control over each LED, researchers can send complex sequences to the brain that may resemble the distributed activity that occurs during natural sensations. Because real sensory experiences activate distributed cortical networks — not tiny, localized groups of neurons — the multi-region design mimics more natural patterns of brain activity.\n\n“In the first paper, we used a single micro-LED,” Wu said. “Now we’re using an array of 64 micro-LEDs to control the pattern of cortical activity. The number of patterns we can generate with various combinations of LEDs — frequency, intensity and temporal sequence — is nearly infinite.”\n\nRoughly the size of a postage stamp and thinner than a credit card, the new device also is less invasive. Instead of extending into the brain through a tiny cranial defect, the new soft, flexible device conforms to the surface of the skull and shines light through the bone.\n\n“Red light penetrates tissues quite well,” Kozorovitskiy said. “It reaches deep enough to activate neurons through the skull.”\n\nTo test the system, the team used mice engineered to have light-responsive cortical neurons. Then, they trained the mice to associate a particular pattern of brain stimulation with a reward. Typically, this task involved visiting a specific port in a chamber.\n\nIn a series of trials, the implant delivered a specific pattern across four cortical regions — like tapping a code directly onto neural circuits. The mice quickly learned to recognize this target pattern among dozens of alternatives. Using artificial signals carried by the target pattern, they chose the correct port to receive a reward.\n\n“By consistently selecting the correct port, the animal showed that it received the message,” Wu said. “They can’t use language to tell us what they sense, so they communicate through their behavior.”\n\nNow that the team has shown the brain can interpret patterned stimulation as meaningful signals, they plan to test more complex patterns and explore how many distinct patterns the brain can learn. Future iterations might include more LEDs, narrower spacing between LEDs, larger arrays covering more of the cortex and wavelengths of light that penetrate deeper into the brain.\n\nThe study was supported by the Querrey Simpson Institute of Bioelectronics, NINDS/BRAIN Initiative, National Institute of Mental Health, One Mind Nick LeDeit Rising Star Research Award, Kavli Exploration Award, Shaw Family Pioneer Award, Simons Foundation, Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and Christina Enroth-Cugell and David Cugell Fellowship.",

    "description": "Wait, iFixit seriously didn’t have an app until 2025? Well, not since we got kicked out of the App Store. But we’re back, baby.",
    "fullText": "We’ve got big news: Today, you can download the iFixit app from the App Store and Google Play Store. All the repair guides you know and love, streamlined for mobile. A workbench that keeps track of your repairs. And some awesome app-only features, including a battery lifespan predictor and voice control with our brand-new AI repair buddy, FixBot.\n\nWait, iFixit seriously didn’t have an app until 2025? Well, not quite. We actually first launched an app back in 2011. But then, in 2015, we tore down a developer unit Apple TV and got kicked out of the App Store.\n\nSince then, we’ve been app-less. Our community, though, has kept asking for more mobile-native goodness. We’ve heard you, and we’re proud to finally share what we’ve been working on.\n\nNow, we’re back, baby. And better than ever.\n\nWe own more stuff than any generation in history, yet we know how to fix less of it. The diversity of what we own has outpaced our ability to learn how to fix it. Smart thermostats. E-bikes. Robot vacuums. Air fryers with WiFi. New products are hitting the market faster than ever.\n\nWhenever I fix something, I think about my grandfather. If something broke around the house, we called him. He’s the one who taught me to crack open a broken tube stereo instead of being afraid of it. His dad taught him on his hay farm; he taught me. That knowledge accumulated across generations because the fundamentals stayed stable long enough to pass down. But grandpa never saw a Nintendo Switch. Nobody’s grandmother knows how to fix a robot vacuum. We’re the first generation that has to figure most of this out alone.\n\nFortunately, more repair information is becoming available every day. Right to Repair laws are finally forcing manufacturers to share service manuals. iFixit and YouTube tutorials exist for everything. But Google has become a wasteland of AI-generated spam and affiliate marketing clickbait. We’ve all lived through the exhaustion of scrubbing through seven YouTube videos, each promising an “easy fix,” hunting for the one that actually shows the right screw.\n\nYet repair has never been more necessary. Life has gotten expensive. When an $800 phone breaks, that’s a month of groceries. We need to fix our stuff, and we can’t afford to waste hours hunting for answers. That’s where the iFixit app comes in: your trusted filter through the noise. Human-verified guides. Community-tested solutions. The wisdom of millions of successful repairs, distilled into one voice you can actually trust.\n\nSo what’s in the app? Well, it’s an app for your phone, so let’s start there. We built a complete toolkit for maintaining your phone, from tracking battery wear to more intensive fixes.\n\nYour phone doesn’t warn you that the battery is wearing out. It just gets worse and worse until one day you realize you’re tethered to a charger and your phone starts shutting down at 20%. This drives me crazy. I don’t understand why manufacturers don’t tell you when to expect to perform maintenance. Your car tells you when to change the oil!\n\nSo we built a tool that monitors your battery’s actual capacity in real time. Instead of abrupt shifts from “good” to “service needed,” we made some simple graphs plotting how your battery is wearing down. The app tells you months in advance when your battery will need replacing, so you can plan the repair on your schedule instead of scrambling when your phone dies at the airport.\n\nThis beta feature is a work in progress, because every phone reports its battery data a little differently. Apple doesn’t make the data available directly via an API, but allows access through an analytics file. Samsung makes it hard to get data on batteries that aren’t calibrated with secret software in their authorized service centers. But we’ve been able to pull together something that is useful in most situations. Give it a try and let us know your experience, and we’ll keep improving the accuracy as we go.\n\nFixBot: Your AI Repair Companion\n\nGrandpa isn’t around anymore, and I miss having someone to ask when I’m puzzled by a repair problem. FixBot is like having a patient repair expert on speed dial. Describe your problem by voice or text and it’ll walk you through diagnosis and repair, adapting to what you’re actually seeing. We gave FixBot a voice because it’s hard to use a device while you’re turning a screw. My hands are often covered in some kind of grease that I don’t want on my screen. And unlike generic AI, FixBot is trained on millions of successful iFixit community repairs, not internet averages and clickbait.\n\nWe’ve spent two years pouring everything we know about repair into FixBot, and we’re really thrilled with the result. I wrote more about what FixBot can do over here.\n\nLast week, my two year old decided my Pixel 7 Pro was a football and cracked the screen. The app knows what phone I have, and immediately routes me to the part and guide I need. No more paging through Google or fumbling with browser tabs mid-repair. Our goal was to streamline the process: Figure out what the fix will take, find the right part, and follow the guide to install it. Open the app and get to work.\n\nOf course, the app includes all of iFixit at your fingertips. Thousands of step-by-step guides, with photos at every stage. Save your devices to the app and skip the endless hunt for model numbers. Your stuff is right there when you need it. Search actually works: type “screen flickering” and get real answers, not SEO noise. Professional-grade documentation, built for first-timers.\n\nThere’s nothing worse than finishing a repair and having a low quality part let you down. I’ve suffered through shoddy parts from Amazon too many times, and I’m over it. We only sell parts I’d use myself. The app checks compatibility before you order, so you’re not returning the wrong battery for the third time. Tools are high quality and hand curated. When you know what you need, ordering is fast.\n\nWe had a ceiling fan that would only kick on if you banged the wall. Grandpa laughed and called it a poltergeist. I was intimidated to try fixing it myself. What if I made it worse?\n\nHelping him rewire that fan helped me realize how capable I really was. I flipped the switch, the ceiling fan started working again, and I thought: I can’t believe I did that. Now, I teach other people to fix things they never thought they could. The second repair is always easier. By the third, they start looking around their house differently. What else can I fix?\n\nThis is the confidence cascade, and it changes how you see yourself. You stop being a consumer who passively buys and abandons. You become a maintainer. An owner. You take care of your stuff instead of being at its mercy. Fixing things is the antidote to learned helplessness. Every successful repair is proof that you’re not dependent on the next available technician, on some company that would rather you just buy a new one.\n\nWe live in an era of planned obsolescence. Companies want you renting, not owning. The iFixit community has been pushing back against that. We’re a bunch of regular folks proving to ourselves, one repair at a time, that regular people can take care of their own stuff.\n\nThat’s the movement you’re joining. Repair is power. Your things belong to you. Being able to fix your own stuff is a skill worth having.\n\nAnd right now? It’s a skill we can’t afford not to have. Life has gotten expensive. Wages haven’t kept up. Your phone breaking shouldn’t mean choosing between a replacement and rent. Learning to fix what you own is incredibly satisfying. The iFixit app is a grandfather in your pocket: patient, knowledgeable, and ready to help you figure it out.\n\nThe iFixit app is in both Google Play and, rather shockingly, Apple’s App Store. Get it while it’s hot.\n\nThis is just the beginning: let us know what you think and what we should add next over on iFixit Meta.",

    "description": "Former Disney dealmaker Kevin Mayer predicts \"more fireworks\" in the bidding war for Warner Bros. between Netflix and Paramount.",
    "fullText": "A former Disney executive who oversaw its dealmaking expects \"more fireworks\" in the bidding war for Warner Bros.\n\n\"I would be very surprised if we don't see a sweetened, and perhaps meaningfully sweetened, offer\" from Netflix, Paramount Skydance, or both, said Kevin Mayer, Disney's former top dealmaker, on Tuesday at the UBS media conference.\n\nOn Friday, Netflix agreed to buy Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studio assets for $82.7 billion, including debt. Paramount Skydance then launched a hostile offer, saying on Monday that it's willing to pay $108.4 billion for the whole firm, including the TV networks like CNN and HGTV. Executives at Netflix and Paramount CEO David Ellison have each framed their offers as the best for employees, Hollywood, WBD shareholders, and TV viewers. Both suitors also said they're confident they can pass regulatory scrutiny.\n\nMayer, now the co-CEO of Cocomelon owner Candle Media, said he thinks Paramount's hostile bid will reignite the faceoff for Warner Bros. and force the eventual winner to fork over more money.\n\n\"From the Warner Bros. Discovery perspective, this is nothing but good news,\" Mayer said.\n\nMayer added: \"Does it move up another $5 billion or $10 billion? I think it probably does. That's what it's going to take to win it.\"\n\nMayer said the battle for Warner Bros. reminds him of the fight for control of 21st Century Fox between Disney and Comcast, which he was involved in during his tenure at the Mouse House.\n\nUnder Mayer, Disney agreed to buy Fox's studio, FX, and its stake in Hulu for $52.4 billion in equity, or $66.1 billion with debt, in December 2017. Six months later, cable giant Comcast made a $65 billion all-cash offer for those same assets. Disney ultimately won, but it was forced to pay a heftier price of $71.3 billion. Mayer helped engineer Disney's initial agreement with Fox, but had moved to a role atop Disney's streaming business by the time the acquisition closed.\n\n\"That was a difficult process,\" Mayer said of Comcast's bid for Fox. \"It added $19 billion to the price tag. Still a good deal, but not the exceptional deal that it was before we had to pay more.\"\n\nWhile Disney's deal with Fox gave it control over Hulu and bolstered its library, Disney activist investor Nelson Peltz argued that the Mouse House had shown \"poor judgment\" by \"overpaying for the 21st Century Fox assets.\"\n\nAs Netflix and Paramount vie for Warner Bros., Mayer said the Disney-Comcast showdown \"points to where we might see this going.\"\n\nThat's because Ellison's $30-per-share hostile bid, which Paramount also sent to WBD's board, might not be rich enough, Mayer said.\n\n\"David Ellison has already kind of hinted at that, that he hasn't done his best and final yet, and I suspect he hasn't,\" Mayer said.\n\nMayer was likely referencing a text message from Ellison to WBD CEO David Zaslav, which was made public as part of a Paramount filing on Monday: \"Please note importantly we did not include 'best and final' in our bid.\"\n\n\"The team at Paramount is aggressive,\" Mayer said. He pointed to the gargantuan amount of money that David Ellison and his father, Oracle billionaire Larry, have at their disposal.\n\n\"I don't think there's a whole lot of hesitancy to spend it,\" Mayer said.",

    "description": "While a lot can be learned from failure, inventor James Dyson says his EV project didn't result in any key learnings. But it did bring in talent.",
    "fullText": "Not all of Sir James Dyson's failures have resulted in a font of learnings. But even failures can have a silver lining.\n\nThe billionaire British inventor helped reshape what people expect from home appliances, particularly the modern vacuum cleaner. His company's history is one of overcoming failures and rejections to create successful products.\n\nHowever, some of Dyson's visions never got past the prototype phase. In 2014, the company decided that it would work on building an electric car since it already manufactured electric motors for its existing products. By 2019, though, the project was scrapped, as it was \"no-longer commercially viable,\" Dyson wrote in a 2020 blog post.\n\n\"Everybody said, 'You know, you must have learned a lot from that experience,' and the answer is I learned absolutely nothing,\" Dyson told podcast host David Senra in a Monday episode of his show.\n\nDyson spent about $750 million on research and development for its electric car. Then came the 2016 \"Dieselgate\" scandal in which Volkswagen was called out for misleading \"clean diesel\" ads, triggering billions in fines and reshaping the global auto industry. As automotive companies jumped into making EVs, Dyson said they became more expensive to produce.\n\nIt was \"fun to do,\" Dyson said, and it produced one model in its Singapore office and a somewhat drivable prototype in one of the company's hangars.\n\n\"It was a difficult decision to stop, because hundreds of engineers, scientists and designers, had poured everything into the project and it was a great engineering achievement,\" Dyson said in the blog post.\n\nHowever, the company said it simply couldn't afford to invest the money into overcoming the \"huge disadvantages\" that come along with only manufacturing EVs. He pointed to one competitor that had the funds to do so, and it's still around today.\n\n\"Tesla overcame that through sheer scale and might and investment, but we didn't have that sort of money,\" Dyson said on the podcast. \"We couldn't take that sort of risk, so we stopped it.\"\n\n\"Sadly, we didn't really learn anything from it,\" Dyson said.\n\nBuilding an EV isn't an easy undertaking even for companies that have billions to pour into research and development. In 2024, Apple reportedly decided to sunset its electric car project after pushing back the car's launch date to 2028 amid production challenges.\n\nDyson has previously said that he doesn't regret pursuing an EV even if nothing came of it. It brought in talented engineers, and while half the people who worked on the project ended up leaving for other manufacturers, the other half were put back to work on vacuum cleaners, Dyson said.\n\nA Dyson spokesperson told Business Insider that the inventor believes \"passionately in the importance of failure.\"\n\n\"The project brought a significant influx of talented engineers and scientists into Dyson, and those engineers have contributed to many successes across Dyson's R&D, with their expertise strengthening Dyson's innovation in multiple areas,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nAlthough Dyson said he doesn't test drive the prototype anymore, there is one scrapped project that remains close to Dyson's heart — or at least useful in his day-to-day life.\n\nThe Dyson CR01 Contrarotator is a washing machine that was discontinued in 2005 after it failed to gain traction with a $1,300 price tag that dwarfed that of the competition. However, Dyson said he still uses his.\n\n\"I use them,\" Dyson said. \"It's great, and people have now copied a lot of the ideas, like the big door.\"",

    "description": "I thought it would be hard to keep the Christmas spirit alive  in my interfaith family when my kids outgrew Santa. Then I found a new tradition.",
    "fullText": "\"Don't come into the attic, I'm wrapping Christmas gifts,\" I shouted to my youngest child last December, awaiting her response. She'd recently turned 11, and in my heart, I knew she no longer believed in Santa.\n\n\"Mom! Don't forget, I want Monopoly,\" she casually called back.\n\nI scrunched my eyelids together, holding back hot tears. Santa, the only arbiter of Christmas gifts in our household, was also the magic link to my Italian Catholic childhood for me and for my Jewish children, whom I'm raising in my husband's faith.\n\nEven though my kids go to synagogue and have been bar and bat mitzvah'd, it was important to me that they celebrate my Christmas traditions with my family, and Santa has always been an integral part of the holiday.\n\nBut now, my worst fear was confirmed. Without having to ask her, my daughter communicated that she realized St. Nick didn't exist in her world any more. I was left to wonder how our family would keep the holiday sparkle, my Christmas tradition, alive if Santa's magic had been put to rest.\n\nSure, Christmas would be easier now that my baby was wiser, but a dull ache still enveloped my heart. Knowing I was turning 50 in early December added to my melancholy.\n\nPart of the reason why I continued the Kris Kringle tradition was that watching my children blissfully tear open presents reminded me of my own childhood excitement, which was especially high the year I turned 8, when a brand-new tape recorder and microphone gleamed under the tree. I remember that magic, and wanted my children to keep feeling it, too.\n\nNow that Santa had vanished from our Christmas celebrations, I felt like I was left with a meaningless pile of boxes to wrap, a slog without his enchantment. I wished for a \"Back to the Future\" moment, one where I'd revisit my childhood for just one day.\n\nInstead, my night sweats, coupled with the shock that my face (amongst other body parts) was inching downward, caused me to wonder, \"Am I closer to where I'm going than where I came from? Will my children channel Santa when I'm gone?\" I'll admit, it was all very dramatic.\n\nAs the first week of December approached, I flipped through a childhood photo album, hoping, once again, to relive my youth. There, I saw a picture of myself with the recorder and microphone that I remembered so fondly. That's when my inner child whispered, \"karaoke,\" as I looked into an imaginary spotlight, and I made jazz hands.\n\nLater that month, I rang in my 50th birthday with friends at Baby Grand, a karaoke bar in New York City. High on the vocal vibrations of the night, I Amazon-primed a karaoke machine to my house as a birthday gift and pondered my annual Christmas Eve gala. I thought singing might make it a more cheerful occasion now that Santa wouldn't be getting the spotlight.\n\n\"I'm serving seven fishes, but not gefilte,\" I joked, as I invited my extended Jewish relatives to join our Italian festa, something I'd never done before. I hoped my cousins wouldn't be offended that I'd turned our annual Christmas gathering into a Broadway-like musical. I also worried that my three kids, aged 11 to 19 at the time, would be so embarrassed they'd refuse to participate.\n\nThat night, I tossed my hair like Janice Joplin and belted out, \"Busted down in Baton Rouge,\" a line from one of my favorite tunes. The crowd was quiet, so I opened my eyes and took a breath. Then, everyone woo-hoo'd as I crooned the rest of \"Me and Bobby McGee\" and bowed. Then my cousin and his fiancée started \"Sweet Caroline.\"\n\nMy kids' beaming smiles radiated joy, not embarrassment. For a moment, while they clapped and we harmonized together singing the line, \"Good times never felt so good,\" I was a kid again, and the Santa vibes surrounded us as a new tradition was born.\n\nThis year, I'll bust out the karaoke microphones again, lure my Dad to the stage with a little Frank Sinatra, and ply the Jewish side of the family with extra eggnog in hopes that they'll all indulge my new tradition again. I can't wait.",

    "description": "MIT researchers at the School of Architecture and Planning developed a speech-to-reality system that combines generative AI, natural language processing, and robotic assembly to fabricate physical objects from spoken prompts.",
    "fullText": "Generative AI and robotics are moving us ever closer to the day when we can ask for an object and have it created within a few minutes. In fact, MIT researchers have developed a speech-to-reality system, an AI-driven workflow that allows them to provide input to a robotic arm and “speak objects into existence,” creating things like furniture in as little as five minutes.\n\nWith the speech-to-reality system, a robotic arm mounted on a table is able to receive spoken input from a human, such as “I want a simple stool,” and then construct the objects out of modular components. To date, the researchers have used the system to create stools, shelves, chairs, a small table, and even decorative items such as a dog statue.\n\n“We’re connecting natural language processing, 3D generative AI, and robotic assembly,” says Alexander Htet Kyaw, an MIT graduate student and Morningside Academy for Design (MAD) fellow. “These are rapidly advancing areas of research that haven’t been brought together before in a way that you can actually make physical objects just from a simple speech prompt.”\n\nThe idea started when Kyaw — a graduate student in the departments of Architecture and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science — took Professor Neil Gershenfeld’s course, “How to Make Almost Anything.” In that class, he built the speech-to-reality system. He continued working on the project at the MIT Center for Bits and Atoms (CBA), directed by Gershenfeld, collaborating with graduate students Se Hwan Jeon of the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Miana Smith of CBA.\n\nThe speech-to-reality system begins with speech recognition that processes the user’s request using a large language model, followed by 3D generative AI that creates a digital mesh representation of the object, and a voxelization algorithm that breaks down the 3D mesh into assembly components.\n\nAfter that, geometric processing modifies the AI-generated assembly to account for fabrication and physical constraints associated with the real world, such as the number of components, overhangs, and connectivity of the geometry. This is followed by creation of a feasible assembly sequence and automated path planning for the robotic arm to assemble physical objects from user prompts.\n\n“This project is an interface between humans, AI, and robots to co-create the world around us,” Kyaw says. “Imagine a scenario where you say ‘I want a chair,’ and within five minutes a physical chair materializes in front of you.”\n\nThe team has immediate plans to improve the weight-bearing capability of the furniture by changing the means of connecting the cubes from magnets to more robust connections.\n\n“We’ve also developed pipelines for converting voxel structures into feasible assembly sequences for small, distributed mobile robots, which could help translate this work to structures at any size scale,” Smith says.\n\nThe purpose of using modular components is to eliminate the waste that goes into making physical objects by disassembling and then reassembling them into something different, for instance turning a sofa into a bed when you no longer need the sofa.\n\nBecause Kyaw also has experience using gesture recognition and augmented reality to interact with robots in the fabrication process, he is currently working on incorporating both speech and gestural control into the speech-to-reality system.\n\nLeaning into his memories of the replicator in the “Star Trek” franchise and the robots in the animated film “Big Hero 6,” Kyaw explains his vision.\n\n“I want to increase access for people to make physical objects in a fast, accessible, and sustainable manner,” he says. “I’m working toward a future where the very essence of matter is truly in your control. One where reality can be generated on demand.”\n\nThe team presented their paper “Speech to Reality: On-Demand Production using Natural Language, 3D Generative AI, and Discrete Robotic Assembly” at the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Symposium on Computational Fabrication (SCF ’25) held at MIT on Nov. 21.",

    "description": "Paul Thomas Anderson's movie \"One Battle After Another\" has a thrilling car-chase scene that was filmed on location in California.",
    "fullText": "\"One Battle After Another\" production designer Florencia Martin was driving near the California-Arizona border with director Paul Thomas Anderson on a location scout when they came across a unique stretch of road.\n\nAfter miles and miles of flat roadway cut through the middle of the desert, the topography was suddenly rocky, and the road's dips became so dramatic that they looked like big concrete waves stretching as far as the eye could see.\n\n\"Paul took out his phone and started recording out the car window,\" Martin told Business Insider.\n\nNo one in the car knew it yet, but they'd just found the thrilling ending to their movie.\n\nAnderson's latest epic, which stars Leonardo DiCaprio as an ex-revolutionary who is forced back into the cause to save his daughter Willa (Chase Infiniti) from a deranged military officer (Sean Penn), ends with a tense car-chase scene in which the contours of the road play a key role.\n\nThat only happened because of a stroke of luck. The movie's location manager, Michael Glaser, had taken Martin and Anderson on a three-hour drive from Los Angeles to Blythe, California, to scout a spot for the revolutionaries' camp. On the ride back to LA, they took a different route — one that sent them through a stretch of road outside Borrego Springs, California, that locals call \"The Texas Dip\" for the enormity of its drops.\n\nSoon after that trip, Martin received a new version of the script from Anderson in which the car chase scene ended on \"The Texas Dip.\"\n\nThe thrilling sequence, in which Infiniti's Willa outsmarts an assassin using the road's hills and the angle of the sun, wasn't easy to shoot. The team had scouted the location in the winter, but shot the scene in the summer, so they had to adjust their shooting schedule based on the sun's direction on the road at that time of year. And then there was the unforgiving environment.\n\n\"It was 110 degrees, people had heat exhaustion, there was wind, the dirt would get into the camera and jam it,\" said Martin, whose credits include 2022's \"Babylon\" and Anderson's 2021 movie \"Licorice Pizza.\" \"It was the harshest conditions you could imagine.\"\n\nIt was all worth it once Martin saw the car chase sequence for the first time with an audience.\n\n\"People actually gasped when watching it,\" she said. \"What's special about the way Paul works and being in these locations is you feel it on screen, the dirt on Willa's face, feeling the heat come off the road.\"\n\nMartin still can't believe the sequence is being compared to classic car-chase scenes in movie history.\n\n\"The fact that our movie is compared to movies we've watched like \"The French Connection\" and \"Vanishing Point,\" that are iconic, it's a huge honor,\" she said.\n\n\"One Battle After Another\" is now playing in theaters.",

    "description": "Tapestry, the parent company of Coach, is applying its Gen Z \"road map\" to Kate Spade as it looks to boost the brand.",
    "fullText": "Gen Z is carrying Coach — literally and figuratively.\n\nThat demographic of shoppers, born between 1997 and 2012, is the \"center of the bull's-eye\" for the luxury handbag brand, according to Scott Roe, CFO and COO of Coach's parent company Tapestry.\n\nNow, Tapestry wants to replicate the success it has had with Coach for Kate Spade, which it acquired in 2017.\n\nRoe talked at length about Tapestry's focus on Gen Z during an upcoming episode of Monica Langley's \"Office Hours: Business Edition\" podcast, set to release on Wednesday. Business Insider got an exclusive look at the episode's transcript.\n\nCoach zeroed in on Gen Z out of necessity. Roe told Langley that the company was looking at data, which estimated that, by 2030, about 70% of handbag purchases were going to be made by either Gen Z or millennial buyers. But the average age of Coach buyers was 40, he said.\n\n\"We said, well, that's a problem,\" Roe recounted. \"We got to get younger.\"\n\nDuring Tapestry's November earnings call, CEO Joanne Crevoiserat told investors that Coach had acquired 1.7 million new customers in its most recent quarter, driven by Gen Z. Tapestry also reported revenue of $1.7 billion for the quarter, an increase of 13% year-over-year.\n\nJust like Coach, Kate Spade is \"targeting\" Gen Z, Roe said.\n\n\"We like 18 years as a point of entry. That's when a young lady goes from upper school or high school into college,\" Roe said. \"They typically go from a backpack to a bag.\"\n\nFirst on Tapestry's \"road map\" to bring Kate Spade into the zeitgeist is getting young buyers to \"be aware that Kate Spade exists,\" Roe said, which means increasing marketing spend on the brand.\n\nOne example of a buzzy product that Kate Spade is pushing is its Duo Crossbody Bag, which Roe said is \"already a big bag\" and expects it to be a hit over the holidays.\n\nSocial media, such as videos on YouTube or posts on Reddit, play a role in getting Gen Z to \"consider whether they want to buy the brand,\" Roe said. (He didn't go into detail on Tapestry's strategy of paid social media partnerships with creators, however.)\n\nSome members of the younger Gen Z cohort have more spending power than meets the eye, Roe said.\n\n\"They have six wallets, right? Two grandparents and their parents,\" Roe said.\n\nGoing after Gen Z doesn't come without hurdles, however.\n\n\"As we thought about how we become more relevant to that younger generation, we were also faced with some dilemmas,\" Roe said.\n\nThe biggest obstacle: Gen Z has an endless array of options when it comes to shopping.\n\n\"Because there's so many more choices for them, it's more difficult to break through,\" Roe said.\n\nHow to break through? Marketing. And then more marketing.\n\nRoe said that Tapestry \"more than tripled\" its marketing spend. \"It's our intent to keep doing that.\"",

    "title": "Canadian accused in plot to export Nvidia's AI chips from US to China",
    "description": "Export-controlled technology worth US$30 million with fake brand labels was allegedly addressed to a facility near Toronto’s Pearson airport",
    "fullText": "A Chinese-born Canadian citizen who lives in Mississauga, Ont., was arrested in Virginia by the FBI and charged with trying to smuggle restricted high-tech Nvidia computer chips used in AI processing to China\n\nU.S. authorities seized export-controlled technology worth about $30 million that was addressed to an air freight facility in Mississauga, close to Toronto Pearson International Airport, according to allegations filed in court.\n\nNvidia labels on the components had been removed and replaced with labels for a fake company, authorities said.\n\nThe arrest of Benlin Yuan, of Mississauga, immediately west of Toronto, and the large shipment destined for Toronto are part of Operation Gatekeeper, described by U.S. authorities as targeting “a sophisticated illicit procurement conspiracy and smuggling network that orchestrates buying and exporting controlled high-tech computer chips to China.”\n\nYuan is described in U.S. prosecution documents as president of an information technology company based in Virginia that provides data centre services and IT support and consulting in Canada and the United States. The documents say it is a subsidiary of a Chinese company based in Beijing.\n\nHe was arrested in Sterling, Virginia, on Nov. 28 and charged with conspiring to violate export control acts.\n\nThe network is accused of purchasing at least US$50 million worth of GPUs from a large U.S. technology company.\n\nThe computer products Yuan is alleged to be involved in exporting are Nvidia A100, H100, and H200 Tensor Core graphic processing units, known as GPUs, and HGX baseboards. The equipment is used in artificial intelligence (AI) applications and in high-performance computing. The chips can handle huge amounts of data that is needed in AI applications, an exploding field that is revolutionizing technology.\n\nThe GPUs can perform calculations at higher speeds than most previous computers.\n\nSince about November 2023, a Chinese company has worked to import these chips from the United States, prosecutors allege. The entire plot is alleged to have involved US$160 million in tech goods.\n\nYuan is accused of joining the conspiracy this spring.\n\nIn a criminal complaint sworn by a special agent in the U.S. Department of Commerce, Yuan helped buy the technology using straw purchasers and intermediaries, meaning in the name of a person or company that is not the real end buyer.\n\nThe buyers allegedly declared the goods were for use by customers within the United States or in countries that do not require an export licence, including Taiwan and Thailand.\n\nAt various U.S. warehouses, Nvidia labels were allegedly removed from the computer circuits and relabeled with a fake manufacturing brand of SANDKYAN, according to the criminal complaint against Yuan.\n\nWhen preparing the items for export, the shipping paperwork misclassified the products as harmless and unrestricted pieces of tech: “adapters,” “adapter modules,” and “computer controllers,” authorities claim.\n\nThey were then shipped, directly or indirectly, to China.\n\nInvestigators received a tip about pallets of suspicious GPUs at a New Jersey warehouse that were addressed to companies in China.\n\nAn undercover agent was sent inside, where he spent an hour.\n\nThe agent allegedly saw two engineers who appeared to be of Chinese origin unboxing Nvidia components. One of the engineers spoke to the undercover agent in Mandarin, documents say. The engineers said they had to cover up all of the Nvidia branding on the equipment for “export purposes,” court filings allege.\n\nThe agent watched Nvidia labels being pulled off and new ones for the fake firm put in their place. The next day the agent returned and found the boxes had been resealed. The products were now labeled as having been “Made in Taiwan.”\n\nNot only were those packages addressed for shipping to Toronto, but warehouse employees told agents they recently had several similar tech exports to Canada.\n\nThe packages were removed and secured in a government warehouse. That sparked a flow of complaint calls and demand letters about the missing GPUs. The people expecting the goods believed the undercover officer had stolen the products and started negotiating to have them returned, authorities allege.\n\nThey offered $1 million to get their packages back, but insisted the equipment be inspected before payment was made.\n\nYuan is accused of organizing the “inspection.”\n\nHe is accused of recruiting and arranging the group of inspectors and of being one of the six who arrived to examine the packages, about two weeks after the seizure, court filings allege.\n\nThe inspection arrangements were allegedly planned in a group chat using an encrypted communication app and confirmed later over a video conferencing app.\n\nYuan was told by a high-level representative of the buyer in China to make sure no one said the items were destined for China, according to the criminal complaint. He is accused of helping them develop an elaborate “compliance backstory” to justify the products based on false information.\n\nThey also allegedly discussed how to make the million-dollar payment and Yuan was told to send copies of the driver’s licences of everyone on the inspection team. Three trucks were arranged for the pick up.\n\nHe is also accused of handling the storage of a different shipment of Nvidia products destined for China. A cooperating witness for U.S. prosecutors alleged that Yuan told him not to put fake labels on this one as he thought they looked suspicious; he would rather the Nvidia labels just be removed.\n\nAlexander Blanchard, a Virginia-based lawyer for Yuan, declined to comment about Yuan or the case when asked by National Post.\n\n“Operation Gatekeeper has exposed a sophisticated smuggling network that threatens our nation’s security by funneling cutting-edge AI technology to those who would use it against American interests,” said Nicholas Ganjei, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Texas.\n\n“These chips are the building blocks of AI superiority and are integral to modern military applications. The country that controls these chips will control AI technology; the country that controls AI technology will control the future.”\n\nU.S. regulation restricts the export of items that could make a significant contribution to the military potential of other nations or could be detrimental to the foreign policy or national security of the United States.\n\nAdvanced computing integrated circuits, including certain Nvidia-manufactured GPUs were added to the export restriction list in 2022. Some of the latest Nvidia chips have been classed by the U.S. as “critical technologies” that China could use to “modernize its military capabilities in ways that threaten the national security interests of the United States and its allies,” according to export regulations.\n\nThe chips require a special licence to export to China.\n\nOn Monday, the same day Operation Gatekeeper was announced, U.S. President Donald Trump said the United States will allow Nvidia’s H200 processors to be exported to China with a 25 per cent fee.\n\nAlan Hao Hsu, also known as Haochun Hsu, 43, of Missouri City, Texas, and his company both pleaded guilty to smuggling and unlawful export activities in October as part of Operation Gatekeeper.\n\nNewly unsealed court documents say Hsu received more than US$50 million in wire transfers from China to help fund the scheme. He is scheduled for sentencing in February.\n\nFanyue Gong, also known as Tom Gong, 43, a citizen of China who lives in Brooklyn, New York, was also charged in the probe. He is described as the owner of a New York technology company. He was arrested in New York on Dec. 3, and charged with conspiring to smuggle goods out of the United States.\n\nFive unnamed co-conspirators are linked to IT companies based in Hong Kong or Shenzhen, a city on the Pearl River that acts as a bridge between Hong Kong and mainland China.\n\n• Email: ahumphreys@postmedia.com | X: AD_Humphreys\n\nOur website is the place for the latest breaking news, exclusive scoops, longreads and provocative commentary.

    "description": "A detailed technical overview of the ModelMatch system, built on a commercial-grade multi-dimensional video generation benchmark.",
    "fullText": "This is a technical overview of our upcoming ModelMatch feature, scheduled to be released alongside GMI Studios (coming soon!)\n\nTechnical Overview editor: Colin Mo, Head of Content at GMI Cloud\n\nWe present a commercial-grade, multi-dimensional evaluation pipeline leveraging GMI Cloud’s large-scale dataset and RAG annotation. The framework evaluates six key dimensions—aesthetic quality, background consistency, dynamic degree, imaging quality, motion smoothness, and subject consistency—producing both aggregate scores and detailed diagnostic insights.\n\nAs AI-generated video rapidly transforms advertising, entertainment, and social media, the real challenge for businesses is identifying which models deliver reliable, high-quality results at scale.\n\nVideo generation is moving into commercial applications, from content creation to personalized media. With access to a large-scale generated video dataset, GMI Cloud provides a unique platform to benchmark models under realistic, production-level conditions.\n\nEvaluating video generation remains challenging:\n\nOur goal is to build the first commercial-grade, multi-dimensional evaluation pipeline for AI video generation. This framework delivers robust, multi-aspect metrics and actionable insights, enabling model selection and customer-specific optimization.\n\nAll evaluations were conducted using GMI Cloud’s elastic GPU clusters and inference pipelines—the same infrastructure available to customers for real-time video AI deployment. This ensures that benchmark results directly reflect the performance businesses can achieve in production.\n\nThis benchmark provides tangible benefits across the AI video ecosystem:\n\nGMI Cloud provides next-generation AI infrastructure for builders, offering scalable GPU clusters, inference engines, and model evaluation pipelines. Our platform enables anyone to build, evaluate, and deploy AI at scale, removing technical barriers and accelerating commercial adoption.\n\nWe collected a large-scale dataset of generated videos along with their corresponding prompts from GMI Cloud. The dataset is representative of real-world generation scenarios, providing a solid foundation for evaluating model performance under practical conditions.\n\nWe annotated video samples using two AI-assisted tools: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and DeepSeek.\n\nTogether, these tools allow us to efficiently annotate large datasets while maintaining diverse coverage and reliable dimension-level evaluations, without needing to manually watch and score thousands of videos.\n\nTakeaway: This hybrid approach combines the strengths of reference-based retrieval (RAG) and direct video analysis (DeepSeek), giving us a scalable, automated way to annotate and evaluate generated video content.\n\nOur evaluation builds on VBench/F-Bench/VM-Bench, with extensions designed for commercial-scale video generation:\n\nWe assess video quality along six key dimensions:\n\nNote: using vllm(tarsier-7b) is also applicable, new benchmarks in ICCV 2025 coming soon.\n\nScoring and Aggregation Methodology\n\nWe evaluated 271 videos generated by five major model families on GMI Cloud infrastructure, scoring them across six key dimensions: background consistency, aesthetic quality, subject consistency, dynamic degree, imaging quality, and motion smoothness. Each dimension was normalized between 0–1 and weighted (dynamic degree=0.1, others=1.0) to produce an overall ranking that informs practical decision-making.\n\nTakeaway: Seedance-1-0-pro-250528 delivers peak performance for high-motion and technically demanding videos, while Veo3 offers a balanced, reliable choice for a broad range of applications.\n\nBreaking down performance by dimension highlights which models excel for specific business needs:\n\nTakeaway: Multi-dimensional evaluation reveals complementary strengths, guiding clients to choose models based on specific priorities—motion, stability, or overall polish.\n\nConsistent performance across diverse prompts is critical for production reliability and scalability:\n\nA correlation heatmap was generated across the six evaluation dimensions to examine interdependencies between metrics. Preliminary observations include:\n\nTakeaway: Addressing these limitations will enhance evaluation fidelity, alignment with human perception, and practical deployment, positioning this benchmark as a foundation for next-generation AI video tools.\n\nOur evaluation of 271 videos across five major model families reveals several practical insights for model selection:\n\nOverall Performance vs. Dimension-Specific Strengths\n\nPerformance Consistency Matters\n\nPerformance Patterns Across Dimensions\n\nModel Recommendations by Use Case\n\nTakeaway: Selecting the right model depends on specific business needs, and multi-dimensional evaluation enables task-driven, customer-specific recommendations.\n\nFuture iterations will incorporate human perceptual scoring, prompt-style diversity tests, and support for multiple new benchmarks presented at ICCV 2025, establishing a foundation for the world’s first end-to-end commercial Video AI Benchmark. This roadmap enables continuous improvements in model design, evaluation methodology, and business-tailored AI video solutions, while keeping GMI Cloud at the forefront of commercial video AI evaluation and deployment.",

    "title": "Airbus CEO said the future of commercial aviation could be a B-2 bomber-like plane with a cabin in the wing",
    "description": "A blended-wing body aircraft is essentially one giant wing with the cabin built inside. Two California companies are racing Airbus to market.",
    "fullText": "The future of aviation could look surprisingly similar to the triangular paper airplanes you folded as a kid.\n\nIn an interview with Tobias Fuchs and Martin Murphy at the German newspaper Bild, Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said that over the next 30 or 40 years, planemakers may abandon the traditional tube-and-wing layout for a single, thick wing with the passenger cabin built inside.\n\nThis design — known as a \"blended-wing body,\" or BWB — distributes lift across the entire sweeping wing, allowing for heavier carrying capacity and greater efficiency than conventional jets. Faury said a widebody aircraft would be \"better suited\" for the concept.\n\nHe added that the BWB benefits come with trade-offs, including the possibility of eliminating windows. Passengers wouldn't receive any natural light, and some could get disoriented or experience claustrophobia.\n\nEmergency evacuations could also be challenging: passengers and crew would have no view of what's going on outside, and those in the cabin center would be farther from exits than on today's jets.\n\nFaury's comments are the latest sign that Airbus sees opportunity in the blended-wing design, an area where it faces competition from new aircraft makers seeking to beat Airbus to market. The BWB design has a long history.\n\nThe Northrop B-2 Spirit stealth bomber — often cited as the best-known \"flying wing\" aircraft — first flew in 1989. Although the BWB concept dates back even further, renewed interest emerged in the early 1990s when McDonnell Douglas explored a blended-wing transport idea that eventually evolved into the BWB-17 in partnership with NASA.\n\nAfter McDonnell Douglas merged with Boeing in 1997, Boeing continued the work with NASA to produce the X-48 series of subscale demonstrators until the program ended in 2013.\n\nBut, to date, no full-size passenger BWB has been certified or flown, and Boeing has not announced plans to develop its own.\n\nFor its part, Airbus has been exploring BWBs since 2017, and the company's 200-person design is a key pillar of its ZEROe initiative for zero-emission aviation.\n\nIn 2019, the company flew a small-scale demonstrator that showed potential major fuel savings — estimated at around 20% — and new cabin layouts made possible by the wider interior. The long-term vision includes running these aircraft on hydrogen rather than traditional jet fuel.\n\nBut despite the early momentum, Airbus has pushed its initial ZEROe 2035 timeline by as much as 10 years.\n\nAirbus has cited challenges surrounding certification complexity, limited global hydrogen infrastructure, and uncertainty around passenger acceptance — especially when some seats could be positioned far from natural light.\n\nStill, the BWB race is far from just an Airbus effort.\n\nAviation startups like Natilus and JetZero are betting that the unconventional BWB shape could help crack the traditional Boeing-Airbus duopoly, with both targeting launches in the early 2030s.\n\nSan Diego-based Natilus is developing a narrowbody version called Horizon to rival the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737, promising about 25% lower fuel burn but 40% more cabin space. And it can fit into existing airport infrastructure.\n\nCompany CEO Aleksey Matyushev previously told Business Insider that the industry could face a shortfall of roughly 40,000 narrowbody jets over the next 20 years — a number he said is far more than the two legacy players can realistically supply.\n\nMatyushev added that Horizon's larger cabin footprint could allow for wider seats, dedicated family areas, and other special features that go beyond what today's narrowbody jets offer.\n\nRenderings of Horizon's proposed cabin, released in July, show up to three aisles instead of the traditional one or two. Matyushev confirmed to Business Insider that the jet will have windows throughout.\n\nPassengers in the center seats will still be farther from the windows, but Natilus said it is adding skylights and other lighting strategies to mimic the outside.\n\nMeanwhile, 100 miles north in Long Beach, JetZero is pursuing a widebody version called the \"Z4\" that promises up to 50% lower fuel burn and could replace jets like the Boeing 767 and Airbus A330.\n\nThe plane would have similar advantages to Horizon in terms of airport compatibility and seat layout.\n\nJetZero has already attracted interest from United Airlines. In April, United Airlines Ventures, the division that invests in these innovative aircraft, said it planned to buy up to 200 of JetZero's 250-seat Z4s.\n\nManaging director Andrew Chang previously told Business Insider that the aircraft's expansive interior could be game changer that feels like a \"living room in the sky.\"\n\nJetZero successfully flew a subscale prototype called Pathfinder in 2024.",

    "fullText": "A pizza chain founded by the brother of tennis star Michael Chang, and once backed by NBA superstar Kevin Durant, is seeking bankruptcy protection after years of store closures.\n\nThe parent company of Pieology filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Tuesday in California, stating that its debts exceed its assets by at least double. The filing lists over 200 creditors, including many landlords and vendors.\n\nThe chain, founded in 2011, built its reputation on letting customers \"craft\" their own pizzas, calzones, and other foods. By 2022, it was boasting 130 locations in a press release announcing Shawn Thompson, a former Tim Hortons executive, as its CEO.\n\nIts website lists nearly 40 locations, mainly in California, but also in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii. Thompson, whose LinkedIn page suggests his term as CEO ended last month, didn't return a request for comment.\n\nRepresentatives for Pieology, which is expected to continue operating while the bankruptcy proceeds, didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn addition to the bankruptcy filing for Pieology's parent company, The Little Brown Box Pizza, Chang is also seeking bankruptcy protection for a company called Kustom Partner, which appears to be the administrative arm of Pieology.\n\nThe two companies filed for a form of Chapter 11 designed for small businesses that allows them to keep operating while they restructure their debts under court supervision.\n\nListed among Kustom Partner's creditors were numerous tax collectors from Florida, Oregon, Utah, Hawaii, Idaho, Georgia, Arizona, and more.\n\nIn a 2017 story about Durant's investment in Pieology, the basketball legend told ESPN that he was \"impressed with the quality\" of the pizza chain. Representatives for Durant didn't return a request for comment about the status of their investment. Pieology's bankruptcy filing said no one owns more than 10% of the company, suggesting no current institutional owners.\n\nThe Little Brown Box Pizza listed assets of between $100,000 and $500,000 compared to liabilities, or money owed, of between $1 million and $10 million.",

    "fullText": "Cracker Barrel released its Q1 results on Tuesday, reporting losses that sent its share price tumbling more than 9% in after-hours trading.\n\nThe beleaguered Southern restaurant chain reported a 5.7% drop in revenue compared to the prior year's first quarter, and a 4.7% decrease in comparable restaurant sales. It also reported a net income loss of $24.6 million.\n\n\"First quarter results were below our expectations amid unique and ongoing headwinds,\" Cracker Barrel president and chief executive Julie Masino said in a statement released ahead of the earnings call. \"We have adjusted our operational initiatives, menu, and marketing to ensure we are consistently delivering delicious food and exceptional experiences. Additionally, we are executing a variety of cost savings initiatives to bolster our financial performance. Although our recovery will take time, our teams are more committed than ever, and we are confident that we will regain momentum.\"\n\nAmong the headwinds are shifting consumer behaviors that have hit traditional sit-down chains especially hard, as budget-conscious diners trade down to cheaper, faster options and cut back on discretionary travel and dining out — both core drivers of Cracker Barrel's roadside business.\n\nThe company has also struggled to modernize its brand without alienating its base, a tension underscored by its botched logo redesign earlier this year, which sparked an online backlash and became an unexpected PR nightmare.\n\nDuring the earnings call, Masino mentioned that Cracker Barrel is working to \"rebuild trust\" with consumers following the rollback of the rebranding effort, with a focus on improving the guest experience through menu innovation and value-driven promotions — such as a recent all-you-can-eat pancake special and kids' meals that come with free toys.\n\n\"This team is absolutely committed to getting back to a positive trajectory and regaining the traffic momentum that we had and and getting getting back on our front foot here,\" Masino said. \"There's some brand rebuilding and trust rebuilding that we need to do, and there's a sales opportunity, and so we are doing both of those things.\"\n\nCracker Barrel's stock has fallen more than 50% so far this year.",

    "description": "After 15 years as a digital nomad, Kaisu Koskela went on her first cruise. She found it both exciting and overwhelming.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kaisu Koskela, 48, a postdoctoral researcher on digital nomads. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been a digital nomad for 15 years, so Nomad Cruise had been on my radar for a while. What began a decade ago as a relocation cruise for remote workers has grown into something much bigger — twice-yearly trips that feel like floating community conferences.\n\nAs a researcher and policy advisor on digital nomadism, I was especially curious. After some deliberation, my partner and I booked the 27-day Pacific crossing from Seattle to Sydney.\n\nNeither of us had ever been on a cruise before. It felt exciting, but also overwhelming.\n\nSomething was always happening: talks on life and work, meetups, and workshops. All of that was just the nomad program. The ship added even more, from cabaret shows to talks on local history. We also had full days ashore in places like Honolulu and Samoa.\n\nStarlink WiFi made working easy, and I met people in all kinds of fields, from AI to videography. But it was a long route, and no one was overly focused on productivity, including me.\n\nI'd planned to finish an article but never got to it, and honestly, I didn't mind. I was there for the experience.\n\nThe 230 passengers felt like a true snapshot of the nomad world. The youngest passenger was 23, and the oldest was in their 60s, but the majority were in their 30s.\n\nThe cruise is set up as a peer-learning conference: passengers give talks and share their expertise for free. I spoke about digital nomad visas and helped people one-on-one afterward. In return, before I got onstage a performance coach prepped me for my talk, and a designer explained a confusing part of my chart. Everyone gave something.\n\nI was surprised by how many passengers weren't nomads yet. They'd come for inspiration. Some were so enamored by the idea of location independence that they quit their jobs on the spot, pushed over the edge by burnout and encouraged by others to go freelance and build something of their own.\n\nA common theme kept coming up: Don't stay tied to an employer who's breaking you down.\n\nAs the days passed, we created more together. In the first week, someone formed a choir. I joined, and we rehearsed on every sea day before performing a full concert with professional lights and sound. I've had to sacrifice very little to be a digital nomad, but singing in a choir is off the table. Having one of my hobbies back for a month felt incredible.\n\nMeetups took off just as easily. I posted one for speed puzzling and ended up playing with a group that included someone who'd competed in the World Puzzling Championship. What started as a fangirl moment became real technique training.\n\nThe community was big enough that no matter how niche the interest, someone else shared it.\n\nLife onboard was easy — the staff were wonderful, and the vibe felt warm. But being a \"cruise tourist\" on land felt different\n\nVanuatu, an island archipelago in the South Pacific, was our final stop. It was also a new country for me. There, we were dropped on an otherwise uninhabited island where bars and food stalls had been set up just for us. Technically, I've now been to Vanuatu, but I had no contact with local life. I didn't love that.\n\nCruise stops are short; you're usually back onboard by 4:30 p.m. Early in the trip, after docking in Hawaii, we rushed around Maui trying to see everything. It felt pointless, a YouTube video would've given me the same overview.\n\nWe'd cracked the formula by the time we reached Savusavu in Fiji. It was a real town with a market, and we just wandered, with no agenda. I preferred those stops; even a tiny slice of local life beats racing through a checklist.\n\nThe remoteness of the Pacific was surreal. Seattle to Hawaii took a week; Hawaii to Samoa took another 16 days with no land, no ships — just ocean and the occasional pod of dolphins.\n\nThere was even a Crossing the Line ceremony for first-time equator crossers. We had to kiss a fish and jump into the pool. I loved it.\n\nNomad Cruise was expensive — €4,300, or about $5,000 each — so we thought hard before booking. We chose a basic cabin with a window and ate like royalty.\n\nAlcohol was extra, though happy hour made wine about $6 a glass. Onboard purchases came with an automatic 18% tip, plus a crew appreciation fee of about $17 per day. But reaching these destinations on our own would've cost more, and once we were on the ship, I stopped thinking about money; everything felt free.\n\nLeaving after a month on the cruise felt surreal; the community bubble was hard to step out of. I loved the people, the sunsets, and even the small things like watching the weather and birdlife change across the ocean.\n\nI'm sure I'll cross paths and deepen connections with some of the people I met on board. We shared something special.",

    "fullText": "CEO John Stankey said he made some missteps in addressing company culture at AT&T — and shed some new light on his internal memo that went viral.\n\nThe lengthy memo, which was first reported by Business Insider in August, described how the company was moving to a \"more market-based culture,\" setting off discourse about the state of workplace loyalty.\n\nStankey gave some insight into the goal behind the memo during a conversation at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council Summit on Tuesday.\n\nWhen asked to name a mistake he's made, Stankey said he was too slow to tackle the \"culture evolution\" that was needed. He said he put it among several areas of focus for the company and that instead he should've put it at the forefront and forced specific actions to make it happen.\n\nAlan Murray, president of the WSJ Leadership Institute, suggested that was why Stanley sent that memo this year, rather than sooner.\n\n\"The memo shouldn't be over-rotated on. It's one of a series of steps in trying to put a framework out there and remove excuses for leaders to lead,\" Stankey said, adding the memo gave context on the framework he was building for the business.\n\n\"That memo outlined my point of view on it, and it gives leaders that want to lead all the air cover in the world they need to go and execute around that framework,\" he said.\n\nAT&T has undergone a number of changes as a company in the past year, including a return-to-office mandate of five days a week.\n\nIn the memo to employees, Stankey effectively said they should get on board with changes to the company culture, or get out.\n\n\"We run a dynamic, customer-facing business, tackling large-scale, challenging initiatives,\" Stankey said in the memo. \"If the requirements dictated by this dynamic do not align to your personal desires, you have every right to find a career opportunity that is suitable to your aspirations and needs.\"\n\nAt the event on Tuesday, Stankey also outlined how AT&T is pushing employees to adopt AI. He said the company has tutorials and other educational tools for employees to upskill with AI, and that he's paying attention to who is using them.\n\n\"I want to see who's building their skill set, where they're building, and this is just the next set of skills that people are going to have to have,\" he said.",

    "description": "Elon Musk said he wouldn't participate in the DOGE office again, adding that it was only \"somewhat\" successful in saving taxpayer money.",
    "fullText": "If he could do it all over again, Elon Musk says he wouldn't have participated in DOGE.\n\nSpeaking on \"The Katie Miller Podcast,\" the Tesla and SpaceX CEO said the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, a new office created at the beginning of President Donald Trump's second term, was only \"somewhat successful\" at saving taxpayer money, and Musk believes he could have better spent his time focused on his various business ventures.\n\n\"I guess I couldn't believe I was there for the most part. It's like — it all seemed extremely surreal at the time,\" Musk told Miller, who is married to Stephen Miller, who currently serves as White House deputy chief of staff.\n\nThe name DOGE itself, Musk said, was made up \"based on internet suggestions,\" and, while he still agrees that it's a worthwhile cause to try to slow government spending, he doesn't see his efforts as particularly effective during the months he worked alongside the Trump administration.\n\n\"We were a little bit successful. We were somewhat successful,\" Musk said. \"I mean, we stopped a lot of funding that really just made no sense, that was just entirely wasteful. For example, there was probably $100, maybe $200 billion worth of zombie payments per year, which simply by enforcing that there be a payment code and an explanation for the payment, the payment would not go out.\"\n\nWhile Musk had initially projected DOGE would save an estimated $2 trillion, he later revised his estimate to project nearly $150 billion in spending cuts for the 2026 fiscal year before he stepped back from the office in April, Business Insider has previously reported.\n\nWhile it is unclear exactly how much the office ultimately saved before it quietly disbanded in July, an August analysis by Politico verified $1.4 billion in confirmed contract cancellations and a decrease in federal spending.\n\nWhen asked directly by Miller whether he'd participate in the DOGE office if he could repeat history, Musk thought for just a moment before sighing and saying he would not.\n\n\"No, I don't think so. Would I do it? I think I probably — I don't know,\" Musk said. \"I think instead of doing DOGE, I would have basically built, you know, worked on my companies, essentially, and the cars — they wouldn't have been burning the cars.\"\n\nMusk faced intense public backlash and was the subject of numerous protests, including vandalism against Tesla, as a result of his work with the Trump administration. Musk described the backlash as \"a very strong reaction\" to his attempt to stop \"political corruption.\"\n\nThe fallout was also concerning to Tesla investors, some of whom worried Musk was spending too much time at the White House and not enough on the electric-vehicle maker.\n\n\"We think shareholders have legitimate concerns about Elon Musk being spread too thin, and it's become clear he's now spending more time on DOGE than anything else,\" Garrett Nelson, a senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, told Business Insider in March.\n\nTesla's stock plummeted in the first half of the year but began to rally after Musk announced he'd be leaving DOGE and officially stepped away in May. As of market close Tuesday, Tesla's stock was up over 17% this year.\n\nMusk's relationship with Trump soured in June after Musk criticized the president's \"Big Beautiful Bill.\" The pair publicly feuded for months, but Business Insider reported in November that the tension between the two had eased recently, and Musk was invited to Trump's White House dinner with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.",

    "fullText": "on December 9, 2025 at 12:30PM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nWhile big, explosive video games with fast action and heavy drama are fun to play, sometimes you might be in the mood for something a little more lowkey, where you can simply turn on the game and lose yourself in it for a while. That's where the games featured in Wholesome Snack come in, as this showcase is tuned specifically to present games with a cozier, lighter side.\n\nTwenty-two games appeared on the menu in this year's Wholesome Snack, ranging from long-awaited sequels like Coffee Talk Tokyo, to new games like Arcane Eats and Fishbowl. The gallery below lists all 22 games shown off during today's presentation.\n\nThe Wholesome Games initiative, run by a team of just four people, is \"driven by the core values of finding and sharing games that are artistically driven, inclusive, and emotionally resonant.\" The organization also includes a publishing arm, Wholesome Games Presents, with its most recent published games including MakeRoom and Is This Seat Taken?\n\nSpellgarden Games began Wholesome Snack 2025 with Thrifty Business, in which players will own and operate a vintage thrift shop straight out of the 1990s. Everything in the store, from shelving arrangements to the decor on the walls, can be customized to the player's liking before customers come in and peruse the wares.\n\nLost and Found Co. stars the adorable Ducky, who works for a company that helps those in need find lost objects hidden in the world. Players will help Ducky find the hidden objects, solve puzzles, and more across multiple maps, from serene river scenes to bustling marketplaces.\n\nNext up was b-e-e-t-l-e: be right back, developed by a two-person team called Paul and Viv, which sees a cute little gator guy set off on a quest to find his pet beetle. Players will help the little fella find his friend through unique typing mechanics that help solve puzzles standing in his way.\n\nStudio Drydock's follow-up to popular Apple Arcade life sim Wylde Flowers, Wylde Society is a period drama that will mix afternoon tea with arcane magic within the magical boarding house known as Fairhaven.\n\nSpeaking of Wylde Flowers, Studio Drydock's first smash hit has been confirmed for release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox on PC ... and it's available now!\n\nTove Jansson's whimsical Moomin universe comes to life once again in Moomintroll: Winter's Warmth. The follow-up to Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley, Moomintroll sees the valley covered in snow and ice, and he must set off on a journey to free the land from Lady of the Cold.\n\nThe words \"post-apocalyptic adventure\" don't normally sound cozy, but Verdant's alternate version of 1980s Germany is trying to change that. Players will assume the role of a young adventurer trying to navigate this new world, while also finding their place within it.\n\nSpirit Crossing, the latest from Cozy Grove developer Spry Fox, is a cooperative life sim where players will build a village in a world of ancient ruins, spirits, and storms. Fishing, exploration, and even a little dancing will all be part of the village-building experience.\n\nTravel Pack is a narrative adventure with an interesting twist: The story is told through board games. As you meet new people and play games with them, you'll begin to learn more about them simply based on the way they use the on-screen tiles and figures to play the games with you.\n\nMirage: Miracle Quest is a new RPG from the team at the incredibly named Toe Bean Club. Players will control a \"freelance exorcist\" as they travel through a hand-painted world inspired by multiple real-world cultures, including France, Japan, and Madagascar.\n\nNext up was Cozy Caravan from 5 Lives Studios, in which players assume the role of a froggy caravan driver pulling into town for the annual Whizz Bang Fair. Cooking, baking, sewing, and more will all be part of the experience as the caravan travels between villages to help the citizens prepare to celebrate.\n\nFishbowl is a narrative game created by a two-person team in India, where it was supported by PlayStation's India Hero Project. The game follows a girl named Alo, both in the real world and in her dreams and memories, and weaves a tale about dreams, grief, and hope through Alo's everyday tasks, and the choices made while completing them.\n\nA new project from two members of Capybara Games, Find Your Words is a short and cozy adventure set at a children's summer camp. Players will play at the beach, hike through the forest, and more as they help a new camper find their way to new friendships.\n\nThis roguelike deckbuilder from Wonderbelly Games and Skystone Games puts players in the role of a master chef, who uses cards to concoct new and exotic meals to feed hungry customers. Decks are designed with specific food types in mind, and factors like cooking time and energy output must also be considered when building the perfect meal.\n\nCatchMaker mixes bug-catching and matching minigames in a cute and cozy new adventure from Grand Duck Games. Players will befriend a group of indigenous people on a faraway island, while exploring the player-character's past in order to unlock its secrets.\n\nIf you've ever played a merge game like Threes, PANdemonium: Merge takes that familiar setup and throws it into the frying pan, where pan movements will cause the food items within to merge together. Keep flipping to see what sort of wild merges you can make, but don't let your food fall out!\n\nZitifono is a light adventure game set on a line of tropical islands. Players will explore the islands using trains, boats, and other modes of transportation, while also solving puzzles to dig deep into the secrets the islands are keeping.\n\nChorus Worldwide Games brings its popular barista-like Coffee Talk to the shores of Japan with Coffee Talk Tokyo, where the patrons are a mixture of ordinary humans and otherworldly yokai. The clip shown during Wholesome Snack followed a child trying to share some good news, but who keeps getting overshadowed by the adults in the room.\n\nMandrake is a rural life sim set in a world inspired by British history and folklore and dotted with mystical powers and fantastical creatures. In the Wholesome Snack clip, our hero is greeted by the Yolf, a small creature looking to be repaid for long-standing debts, even though it was the character's ancestors who initially made the deal.\n\nThe creators of I Am Future are now in the technology-repair business, as ReStory is a shop-management simulator where players will restore game consoles, computers, and other tech from the era of Y2K. Dialogue-based choices will arise during the game as well, and the way players respond will affect the story's next direction.\n\nD-Topia places players in the role of a \"facilitator\" for a world-controlling AI, and his goal is to keep the residents of the titular D-Topia happy, however possible. Players will solve puzzles and interact with the AI in order to \"maximize happiness\" and keep the peace in D-Topia.\n\nThe final announcement from Wholesome Snack 2025 will appeal to rhythm fans, as the showcase gave us a new look at upcoming rhythm game Bits & Bops. Several new minigames were shown off in the new trailer, along with a big surprise: Bits & Bops is available on Steam now.",

    "description": "The Game Awards host and organizer Geoff Keighley has opened up on the challenges of running a show that aims to celebrate games and the people who make them while also acknowledging the challenging times people in the industry today are facing. So far in 2025, numerous developers lost their jobs, Microsoft canceled games, and the industry further consolidated with EA announcing plans to sell itself to Saudi Arabia.\nSpeaking to The Game Business, Keighley said the introduction of the Game Changer award in 2024 was an initial attempt to address this. Amir Satvat was given the prize for his work to support people who were laid off in the gaming industry.\nKeighley hasn't said if this award is coming back in 2025, but it would be a glaring omission if it did not.",

    "fullText": "They say one person's trash is another's treasure, but a chunk of 'rock' used to keep a door open for decades is a treasure by almost anyone's standards.\n\nA woman discovered the 3.5-kilogram (7.7-pound) stone in a stream bed in southeast Romania, brought it home, and used it as a doorstop.\n\nHer find turned out to be one of the biggest intact chunks of amber in the world, according to a report by El Pais.\n\nIts value? Somewhere in the region of €1 million – around US$1.1 million.\n\nWatch the video below for a summary:\n\nIn Romania, pieces of amber can be found around the village of Colti in sandstone from the banks of the River Buzau, where it has been mined since the 1920s.\n\nKnown as rumanite, this amber is famed and prized for its wide array of deep, reddish hues.\n\nThe elderly woman who found this particular rumanite nugget lived in Colti, where it remained performing a function so humble that it was missed even by jewel thieves who once targeted the home, reports say.\n\nAfter the woman died in 1991, the relative who inherited her home suspected the doorstop might be more than meets the eye.\n\nOn learning what he had, he sold the amber to the Romanian state, which had it appraised by experts at the Museum of History in Krakow in Poland.\n\nAccording to these experts, the amber is likely around 38 to 70 million years old.\n\n\"Its discovery represents a great significance both at a scientific level and at a museum level,\" Daniel Costache, director of the Provincial Museum of Buzau, told El Pais.\n\nClassified as a national treasure of Romania, the nugget has had a home at the Provincial Museum of Buzau – the county in which the relic was found – since 2022.\n\nThe discovery resembles that of a man in Michigan, who kept a large piece of rock as a doorstop, only to find out decades later that he was keeping his doors in place with a meteorite worth $100,000.\n\nA chunk of amber worth over a million dollars isn't a bad score, either, really. Just imagine how many doorstops you could buy.\n\nAmber is tree resin from millions of years in the past. Over time, the highly viscous substance fossilizes into a hard, warm-hued material widely recognized as a gemstone.\n\nAbove ground, tree resin can act like a sticky trap, collecting impressively intact specimens of the invertebrate population for us to study millions of years later.\n\nThough it is fairly common in the Northern Hemisphere, amber has only been discovered intermittently in the southern half of the planet.\n\nDuring the Barremian period, around 122 million years ago, massive amounts of resin were formed by coniferous trees around the world, which reigned over all plants until about 70 million years ago.\n\nIncredible, 112-million-year-old amber recently found at the Genoveva quarry in Ecuador has preserved at least five orders of insects, including a variety of flies, a fungus beetle, wasps, and a caddisfly.\n\nIt also caught evidence of arachnid activity, in the form of a fragment of spider web. The way the strands are oriented suggests the web may have been built in the style of modern orb-weavers, though it lacks the sticky droplets typical of these kinds of webs.\n\n\"These findings provide direct evidence of a humid, resinous forest ecosystem and its arthropod fauna in equatorial Gondwana during the Cretaceous Resinous Interval,\" paleobiologist Xavier Delclòs from the University of Barcelona and colleagues explain in their paper, published in September.\n\nIn 2024, scientists in Germany and the UK discovered amber in West Antarctica for the first time – the fossilized 'blood' of ancient coniferous trees that once grew on Earth's southernmost continent between 83 and 92 million years ago.\n\nAlong with fossils of roots, pollen, and spores, the finding provides some of the best evidence yet that a mid-Cretaceous, swampy rainforest existed near the South Pole, and that this prehistoric environment was \"dominated by conifers\", similar to forests in New Zealand and Patagonia today.\n\n\"Our goal now is to learn more about the forest ecosystem – if it burned down, if we can find traces of life included in the amber,\" said marine geologist Johann Klages from the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany.\n\n\"This discovery allows a journey to the past in yet another more direct way.\"\n\nThanks to the magic of amber, there are even a few ancient tardigrades that have been preserved for millions of years.\n\nAn earlier version of this article was published in September 2024.\n\nAn Animal Expert Explains Why Your Dog Keeps Hiding Everything\n\nComplex Life May Be a Billion Years Older Than We Thought\n\nThis Prehistoric Bird Choked to Death on 800 Rocks, And No One Knows Why",

    "description": "The virus spreads easily and in different ways than other winter viruses. Here’s what to know.",
    "fullText": "Stuffy noses and bothersome coughs aren’t the only winter illness symptoms making the rounds right now. Lots of people are also getting sick with norovirus, an unpleasant stomach bug. The highly contagious virus is on the rise in many states across the country.\n\nWhat is norovirus? “It is our most common cause of vomiting and diarrhea, and actually food-borne illness in the United States,” said Dr. Brintha Vasagar, a family physician in Wisconsin.\n\nHealth: 4 Parts Of Your Body You Shouldn't Forget To Exercise\n\nThose are the two most common symptoms, but fever, body aches and stomachaches are sometimes reported, too.\n\nHuffPost Life delivers practical, reliable advice to navigate life’s challenges and make informed decisions. Support journalism that empowers you — join our membership program today.\n\nWe typically experience higher rates of norovirus “from November to April, so we’re still pretty early in this season,” Vasagar added.\n\nNorovirus cases are currently elevated, but a little lower than where they were by this time last year, said Dr. Camile Gooden, an internal medicine physician at NYU Langone Hospital—Suffolk in New York. However, “Recently, there has been a surge in norovirus ... we’re seeing more positive testing,” Gooden added. This is due to a new strain of the virus.\n\nHealth: Norovirus Cases Are Surging. These Are The Most Common Symptoms Doctors Are Seeing Right Now.\n\nThe virus spreads easily and in different ways than other winter viruses. Here’s what to know:\n\nWhile common winter illnesses such as the flu and COVID-19 spread through coughs and sneezes, norovirus spreads differently.\n\n“Traditionally, it’s [spread through] what we call the fecal-oral route, so stool to mouth, but it’s a pretty darn resilient virus, so it’s not like you’re licking other people’s poop,” said Dr. Ross Newman, a pediatrician based in Oregon and a medical communicator on social media.\n\nInstead, contaminated particles end up on people’s hands or surfaces they touch — and can sometimes even spread through the air, he explained.\n\nHealth: I'm A Hip Surgeon. Here's The 1 Thing I'd Never Do If I Have Hip Pain.\n\nIf someone who has norovirus doesn’t wash their hands well after using the bathroom and then uses a towel to dry their hands, that towel can then become a carrier. Then, if a non-infected person uses that towel to dry their hands, they could pick up the virus.\n\n“It can exist on surfaces for long periods of time ... it can be on blankets, gloves, clothing, hair, skin ... or it can just be from filthy hands,” Newman added.\n\nContaminated surfaces can become a “source of spread,” added Gooden, which is how norovirus commonly rips through places with long-term care settings, day cares and cruise ships — all spaces where people are in close quarters and touching the same door handles, tables, light switches and toys.\n\nNorovirus can also spread through contaminated food, according to Gooden. “If you eat food that has not been washed properly and is contaminated, you could also get ill,” noted Gooden.\n\nHealth: 14 Popular 'Healthy' Habits From 2025 That Aren't Actually Healthy\n\nThis could be from a sick person preparing the food or even from contaminated raw produce, she said.\n\n“You want to make sure that when you are consuming raw vegetables and raw fruits, that those have been washed appropriately because sometimes, even on farms, there might be exposure through irrigation systems to norovirus,” Gooden said.\n\nYou don’t need any fancy produce soaps, instead washing produce well with water is enough to kill the virus, Gooden said.\n\nNorovirus can also spread through shellfish that becomes contaminated by infected water. In this case, fully cooking shellfish can kill the virus, according to Vasagar.\n\nHealth: New Study Reveals When The ‘Adulthood’ Brain Phase Actually Starts — And It’s Way Later Than You Think\n\n“The best way to protect yourself is really to perform good hand washing — and you have to use soap and water. You can’t rely on hand sanitizers necessarily, especially if you’ve touched contaminated surfaces or have come in contact with someone who is ill with norovirus,” Gooden said.\n\nA quick hand rinse isn’t good enough; use hot water and soap, and wash your hands for “the full Happy Birthday song, twice,” Vasagar stressed. “Most people don’t wash their hands long enough to really be effective.”\n\nBeyond hand-washing, disinfecting surfaces with bleach-based cleansers and washing linens frequently can kill the virus, Vasagar noted. This is especially important if someone in your home is sick.\n\n“The spread is ... so contagious that you’re really going to have to work hard to make sure everyone else in the family doesn’t get it,” Vasagar said.\n\n“The vomiting associated with norovirus is generally short-lived, 24 to 48 hours, but the diarrhea can last two weeks,” Newman said.\n\nPeople are most contagious the first one or two days after their symptoms start, but they can shed the virus for weeks after that point, Newman added.\n\nIf you get sick, stay home (and keep sick kids home) if you’re able, all three experts told HuffPost. Also watch out for dehydration, which is “the biggest concern with complications from most stomach bugs,” Newman said.\n\n“You’re losing a lot of fluids with vomiting, a lot of fluids with diarrhea,” Vasagar said. Signs of dehydration include decreased urination, dizziness, dry mouth, and confusion and fatigue. If you notice any of these symptoms, get to a doctor.\n\nTo combat dehydration, drink plenty of fluids, whether that’s water, tea, Gatorade or soup, Gooden noted. Even if you’re throwing up, you should still drink small amounts of fluids.\n\n“It’s really important to monitor for any development of severe symptoms,” Gooden said. “If your symptoms continue beyond 72 hours, usually, that’s a time that I would advise to reach out to your health care professional.”\n\nIf you have fevers, severe abdominal pain or develop blood in your stool, you should seek medical attention, Gooden added.\n\nThe Worst Things You Can Do During Cold And Flu Season\n\nExperts Warn This Winter Virus Will 'Likely Cause A Problem' — Here’s How To Prepare For It\n\nDoctors Say A Highly Infectious Virus Is 'Out Of Control' Right Now.

    "fullText": "A recent statewide ranking named the Austin-area suburb Leander as the No. 5 best city in Texas to move to for 2025, and other Austin neighbors made the list as well.\n\nThe analysis, conducted by a customer review and news platform called ConsumerAffairs, evaluated the 50 most populated Texas cities across five categories: affordability, safety, economy, health care and education, in addition to overall quality of life, to determine which cities were best to move to. Each city earned a score out of 100 possible points.\n\nLeander stood out, the analysis said, for its safety ranking — No. 1 statewide — and it also secured the No. 2 spot for its booming economy.\n\nHowever, the city’s rankings were more modest in other areas. The report ranked Leader No. 12 for health care and education, No. 32 for affordability and No. 40 for quality of life.\n\n“Leander’s origin dates back to the 1880s, when a rail line was constructed to connect Austin to Abilene,” the report said. “Nowhere among Texas’ largest cities is violent crime less common, and over the past five years, no metro area has experienced faster job growth.”\n\nThe suburb, which has a population of around 78,000, was also ranked as one of the top ten places to live by U.S. News and World Reports for 2025-2026.\n\nThe top four cities on the ConsumerAffairs list were all in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, followed by Leander and then Round Rock at No. 9.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK — Another round of bone-chilling air from the Polar Vortex could invade the central and northeastern U.s. this weekend and potentially produce the first significant snowstorm of the season for the Interstate 95 corridor if this cold air meets up with moisture that is expected to race across the country.\n\nCurrent computer forecast model guidance suggests that snow will move into the Midwest Saturday and into the Northeast by Sunday. However, uncertainty remains high regarding all aspects of any snowfall, and those who will be in the Midwest and Northeast should monitor forecast changes as the week progresses.\n\nAccording to the FOX Forecast Center, current forecast models show the circulation of the Polar Vortex weakening later this week into the weekend, which will allow more cold air to spill into the Midwest and Northeast.\n\nThis comes after record low temperatures were already set on Tuesday in New England.\n\nThe Polar Vortex is a large, persistent area of low pressure and cold air near the poles and sits about 10-30 miles above Earth’s surface. A strong Polar Vortex keeps the coldest air contained over the arctic circles; a weaker Polar Vortex allows that frigid air to drop into the lowest level of the atmosphere and dips in the Pacific jet stream usher that cold air from Canada into the Lower 48.\n\nIf enough cold air is able to take hold of the Midwest and Northeast this weekend, it would create prime snow-making conditions for a quick-moving storm system that is currently forecast to move east out of the Pacific Northwest.\n\nWatch: Virginia State Police Trooper Rescues Driver From Burning Vehicle During Dangerous Winter Weather\n\nThis system would also need additional moisture to move up from the south to produce significant snow.\n\nParade Of Fast-moving Clippers Threaten Midwest And Northeast With More Snow, Rain And Strong Winds\n\nIf all these conditions are met, an area of low pressure could form near the coast this weekend, increasing the chance for significant snow across the Northeast, including the Boston, Philadelphia and New York metro areas.\n\nThis would be the first significant snow for that portion of the Interstate 95 corridor.\n\nHowever, if one of these components is missing, snow totals would be depressed.\n\nThis latest storm bears out the long-range outlook from Noaa last month that forecast an active start to meteorological winter, due in part to the La Niña climate pattern.\n\nCheck back for updates on this developing story.\n\nOriginal article",

    "description": "Magic and myth-tery are part of their history.",
    "fullText": "Though the film series petered out after only a couple of movies, Rick Riordan's middle-grade Camp Half-Blood have been revived as a mega-popular Disney+ streaming series. The breathing room offered by a series format seems to have been the key to unlocking their potential as an adaptation, allowing for a more fully realized exploration of this atypical (at least on our side of Mount Olympus) coming-of-age story.\n\nIn its first season, the show found a good balance between fantasy action and teen drama while also having a ton of fun poking at the conventions of ancient myth. Season two is just out, and more is on the way, but it's likely to be a bit of a wait. In the meantime, here are 12 more shows that offer a similar mix of coming-of-age angst, action, and myths and legends.\n\nDoing for fairy tales what Percy Jackson does for Greek mythology, this long-running prime time drama stars Jennifer Morrison as Emma Swan, a struggling bail bond agent who travels to the Maine town of Storybrooke (subtle!) to reconnect with the son who she gave up for adoption. In the process, she discovers that she’s the daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming, given up to protect her from the machinations of Regina (Lana Parrilla), the evil queen who is also responsible for the curse that dropped an endless number of fairy tale characters into this small town to live dreary normal lives without any memories of their past adventures (at least at first). Stream Once Upon a Time on Disney+ and Hulu.\n\nThe tone is very different, but there are thematic and plot similarities aplenty in this appropriately dark fantasy, adapted from the beloved YA series by Philip Pullman and set in an alternate world in which human souls exist outside the body in the form of animal companions called daemons. Lyra Belacqua (Dafne Keen) is an orphaned girl living at Jordan College, Oxford who finds herself involved in a murder plot that brings her into the orbit of the powerful Magisterium, the world's overarching and oppressive religious authority—caught between her mother (Ruth Wilson), a powerful figure in the Magisterium, and her extremist heretic father (James McAvoy). From her steampunk-ish world, Lyra and her daemon Pan travel across a multiverse that includes our very own Earth. Stream His Dark Materials on HBO Max.\n\nAn update to the Winx Club Nickelodeon animated series from back in the day, this show follows five fairies attending a prestigious boarding school for magical types. Not entirely unlike Percy Jackson, our lead fire fairy Bloom soon discovers that her parentage is more alien (literally) than she'd ever known. After a slow start, the show builds into an impressive coming-of-age story, and a rare fantasy series genuinely geared to its teenage target audience. It was cancelled after two seasons, but if you find yourself hooked, a series of graphic novels continues the story. Stream Fate: The Winx Saga on Netflix.\n\nIf \"unacknowledged love children of gods\" is your thing, well, Greek mythology has you covered. Set in an ancient Greek of myth, this adult-oriented animated series introduces Heron, an original character who nevertheless fits firmly in the tradition; here, he's a young miner, illegitimate and thus scorned by his fellow villagers. When demons attack, Heron discovers he's the secret son of Zeus, and that he'll need to help lead humanity defeat flesh-eating creatures born from the blood of fallen titans. Intimately plotted and with an increasingly epic scope, the show blends Greek myth with anime style to tell an addictive original story. Stream Blood of Zeus on Netflix.\n\nThe South Korean import became Disney/Hulu's most-watched K-drama, and did solid business globally (even if the English-language title doesn't suggest major thrills). As the series opens, we meet Kim Bong-seok (Lee Jung-ha), literally weighted down by his mom (as in: she gives him weights to fill his pockets) as he's heading off to school; we soon learn that it's because he can't quite control his ability to fly, and is prone to floating off unexpectedly. Athlete Jang Hui-soo (Go Youn-jung) heals instantly from injuries, while class president Lee Gang-hoon (Kim Do-hoon) is fast and incredibly strong. As it turns out, all of these kids' parents were bred and trained as part of a black ops program from which they've escaped, passing along their abilities to their kids—who have to stifle their powers, lest they draw the attention of spies hunting them down. Stream Moving on Disney+ and Hulu.\n\nNo Greek mythology here (well, we do get a gorgon or two), but Sabrina is also the story of a young woman coming to terms with her destiny at a special school for people with unique powers while having (dark) adventures. Rather than the daughter of a god, Sabrina is a literal child of Lucifer. Sabrina Spellman (Kiernan Shipka) is an old-school witch in a household that’s not at all unlike the Addams family: two witchy aunts (played by Miranda Otto and Lucy Davis) alongside her warlock cousin (Chance Perdomo) and her loyal familiar, Salem the cat, all of them living their witchy lives just out of view of the local normies. At the outset, Sabrina's forced to choose between signing her name in Satan’s book and becoming a full-fledged witch, or staying in high school with her human friends. Instead, she refuses to choose. Cannibalism, human sacrifice, and blood rituals result, as Sabrina is called upon to save her family, and the world, from dark forces. Stream Chilling Adventures of Sabrina on Netflix.\n\nIn this animated series, teenager Luz Noceda (Sarah-Nicole Robles) finds herself trapped in the Demon Realm and there befriends a nonconformist witch Eda Clawthorne (Wendie Malick), who undertakes to teach the non-magical Luz everything she can about magic. Luz is determined to become a full-fledged witch despite her complete lack of prior experience, which is entirely refreshing given the volume of narratives about kids who just kinda discover that they're super-powered nepo babies. Busting open the doors for LGBTQ+ representation on the Disney Channel, this show is chock full of queer characters, and it remained both creatively offbeat and adorable throughout its now completed run. Stream The Own House on Disney+.\n\nA (sorta) standalone spin-off from the rather extensive Vampire Diaries universe, Legacies follows Hope Mikaelson (Danielle Rose Russell), an orphan descended from bloodlines that include vampires, witches, and werewolves—meaning the Salvatore School for the Young and Gifted suits her perfectly. Supernatural beings of all sorts attend, and it serves as a secret haven and training ground for those with powers. It's a place where they can learn to control and/or conceal their abilities—sort of a cross between Wednesday's Nevermore Academy and Camp Half-Blood. The drama is a little more YA to Percy's middle-grade, and naturally, teen angst and romance abound. Stream Legacies on Netflix.\n\nFifteen-year-old American Cece Parker Jones travels to Paris to join the prestigious dance school, only to discover that she's an actual witch from a family with a history of magic. She struggles to balance dance, magic, and her desire to be a normal teenager while dealing with the Mystics, natural enemies to Cece's type of witch. It's a solidly entertaining blend of teen drama, magical duels, and uniquely, ballet. (it's a standalone successor to the time travel-focused Find Me in Paris, which is also on Hulu). Stream Spellbound on Hulu.\n\nBased on the seminal, semi-autobiographical 2006 graphic novel from Gene Luen Yang, this adaptation introduces Jin Wang (Ben Wang), a nerdy and rather ordinary son of Taiwanese immigrants. He befriends confident, generally loud and proud exchange student Wei-Chen (Jimmy Liu), who's embarrassing and inspiring in equal measure. It's soon revealed that Wei-Chen is no ordinary kid, but rather the son of legendary Chinese figure the Monkey King, and he's on Earth looking for the ordinary teenager he believes can help him stop an uprising against Heaven. Ke Huy Quan co-stars as the former child star of a deeply stereotypical '80s sitcom, and Michelle Yeoh appears as goddess of compassion Guanyin. It's disappointing that this only lasted one season, but it tells a fairly complete story nonetheless. Stream American Born Chinese on Disney+.\n\nIn an alternate modern Britain, ghosts are an everyday sight, which is not to say they aren't a nuisance—their touch is deadly. Technological progress has largely ground to a halt, while ghost-hunting agencies are common and, since adults lose the ability to sense ghosts directly, kids and teens are the ones on the front lines. Ruby Stokes (Bridgerton) plays Lucy Carlyle, an extremely sensitive listener who was cast aside when she was unfairly blamed for several deaths at her first job. With nowhere else to go, she joins up with the shady, unregulated Lockwood & Co., a two-orphan operation working outside the law. It's a solidly spooky teen drama with a fair bit of action and a beating heart, in and among all of the dead people. Stream Lockwood & Co. on Netflix.\n\nThis one's definitely not for the young ones, but if you're a grown-up-type person looking for a bit more on Greek mythology, you could do worse than this BBC take on The Iliad (and other Trojan War narratives). Adapting events in and around Homer's work, we begin with the judgment of Paris (Louis Hunter), who's asked by Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite to award an apple to the one he favors most; the goddesses here appear as human-esque characters, marking a change from older takes that saw giants watching from Olympus, and more recent adaptations that do away with gods altogether. We then meet Helen (Bella Dayne), a Spartan citizen in a loveless marriage, before following the action to Troy. The show has a lush, bronze-age aesthetic and displays an impressive fidelity to its varied source material. Stream Troy: Fall of a City on Prime Video and Netflix.",

    "title": "10 Hacks Every iPhone User Should Know",
    "description": "Time to power up.",
    "fullText": "I'm routinely surprised by just how much technology Apple has managed to pack into the iPhone that I can carry in the palm of my hand. What's even more surprising is that underneath the layers, there's even more than what meets the eye. There's a better, faster way to use the keyboard, there's a faster way to select unread emails to archive, there are better ways to browse the web than just the usual Safari experience, and you can get way better photos out of the iPhone Pro cameras than what the stock Camera app shows you.\n\nThe iPhone has become such a default product in all our lives that we just take it for granted. Yes, it's a great way to stay in touch with friends and coworkers, to capture moments, and to doomscroll the night away. But spend some more time, and there's a whole new iPhone experience just waiting for you that will truly transform how your iPhone looks and works.\n\nApple installs the Shortcuts app on every device and even offers pre-built shortcut automations that you can install from the Gallery. But the fun starts when you explore the very active Shortcuts community online and start to integrate Automations into the mix.\n\nApple’s Shortcuts app lets you create automations that automatically follow pre-defined steps. They can be used to resize images, compress files, convert data, and even control aspects of your smartphone. For example, you can create an automation that automatically enables a VPN when you step out of your home, or sends a message to your partner when you leave work. Looking to get started? We have a list of seven automations that I feel every iPhone user should install.\n\nI’m a huge fan of custom widgets. Whenever someone picks up my iPhone, the response is usually something like, \"Your iPhone doesn’t look like a regular iPhone.\" That’s down to custom widgets that show the time, day, my appointments, the weather, my tasks, and more. The world of custom iPhone widgets is huge, and if you just want to dip your toes in, I would suggest you start with the Widgetsmith app, which lets you customize multiple widgets with the same theme and fonts. All together, it looks really aesthetically pleasing. When you’re ready, you can dive in with the Widgy app, where you can import and customize thousands of interactive widgets.\n\nThe iPhone has a hidden button, and it’s on the back of your iPhone. It’s an accessibility feature that you can access via Settings > Accessibility > Touch > Back Tap. You can then assign any app, shortcut, or action to either the Double Tap or Triple Tap gesture. It’s a great way to trigger Shortcuts automations, or to simply bring up the selfie camera. I personally find that the double-tap gesture has a tendency to misfire sometimes, and the triple-tap gesture is a lot more reliable.\n\nIf you don’t use Safari extensions, you’re sleeping on unrealized potential. Just like on the Mac, the Safari browser on the iPhone also supports extensions. And you can use extensions to do some really cool things, like blocking all ads and trackers (of course), but also to force every website to be in dark mode, all the time. You’ll also find extensions to improve the Reddit browsing experience and to take complete control of all the elements on the websites you use frequently.\n\nUsing a third-party browser, like Vivaldi, is a very power-user move. All third-party browsers on iOS are technically variations of Safari, as Apple forces developers to build their browsers on Safari's WebKit platform. However, these third-party browsers can include unique features that Safari doesn't. Vivaldi, for example, offers desktop-class tab browsing, including tab groups and pinned tabs. Then there’s Orion, which can run desktop-class extensions from Firefox and Chrome Web Store on your iPhone (something that Safari can’t do). And if you don’t like Safari’s new interface, try out Quiche, which is a completely customizable browser.\n\nFocuses have the potential to transform how your iPhone looks and works, based on your location, time, day, or the task at hand. It’s time to go beyond Do Not Disturb and embrace everything that Apple's Focuses can do.\n\nIt would be a good idea for you to set up Focuses for Work, Personal Time, and Sleep. In each Focus, you can decide which apps can send notifications, and which friends or family members can contact you. You can even choose which home screens to show in particular Focus, choosing to hide widgets and apps depending on the Focus (no work stuff at all in Personal Time Focus, for example). Focus also integrates with Shortcuts and Automations, so you can trigger a Focus when you start a video call on your Mac or reach a particular location (like your workplace). Go to Settings > Focus to get started.\n\nYou’ll be familiar with all the usual iPhone gestures, like swiping up from the Home bar, or tapping the top edge of the iPhone to instantly scroll to the top. But the iPhone has a lot more hidden gestures that can really speed things up. If you see a long list, try to swipe down with two fingers to instantly start selecting items. This works really well in Mail, Phone, and other Apple apps, but is also supported by third-party apps. Next, in iOS 26, Apple added back gesture support that’s arguably better than Android. You can swipe in from anywhere on the left edge to quickly go back.\n\nYou can also cut, copy, and paste with a three-finger gesture. To copy something, pinch it with three fingers. To cut, do it twice. To paste something, do a three-finger spread gesture (opposite of the pinch).\n\nThe iPhone keyboard is more than what meets the eye. It has a built-in Slide to Type feature where you can glide your finger over the keys to type words. It works really well, especially when using the phone one-handed. There’s a virtual trackpad built in, too. Just tap and hold the Space bar and move your finger to move the cursor around.\n\nIf you find your keyboard too large to type on, you can also enable the one-handed keyboard from the Keyboard Settings button (tap and hold the Globe icon). From here, you can go to Keyboard Settings to enable a multi-lingual keyboard and to try out Text Replacement, where you can create shortcuts for expanding your frequently used text snippets. For example, you can type “adrs” to expand to your full home address.\n\nYou might not know this, but there’s a really neat document scanner built into the Notes app and the Files app. I prefer to use the Files app for this because I get to save a PDF directly in the folder that I want. Open the Files app, go to any folder, tap the three-dotted Menu icon, and choose the Scan Documents feature. There’s an Auto Shutter feature that’s enabled by default that will automatically scan each new page you put in front of your camera (if you find this annoying, you can disable it as well). Scan as many pages as you want, and tap the Done button. Then, give the document a name. And it’s now stored as a PDF in the folder. You can now send it to where it needs to go, or back it up using iCloud Drive.\n\nThe cameras on the iPhone Pro are truly stellar. But the Camera app is not. The default Camera app does too much computational photography for my taste, and has trouble focusing on elements exactly when I need to capture something small. Plus, the Pro cameras can shoot in Log in ProRes, and to fully take control of the visuals from your iPhone, you’ll need to step out of the Camera app.\n\nFor shooting video in the best light, Blackmagic is a great choice. Here, you get full manual control over both photos and videos, with film-grade presets (including the ability to create your own custom ones).\n\nIf that feels a bit too Pro, try using a third-party app to capture much better photos. My colleague Pranay has highlighted a couple of great options, with Halide Mark II topping the list (I agree, as well). Halide gives you a lot more control over the look of your photos. There’s also a Process Zero feature that removes all of Apple’s computational processes from the photos.",

    "title": "You Might Be A 'Lower-Class' Retiree If Your Social Security Check Is Below This Number",
    "description": "Is your Social Security check below this number? You might only be earning a fraction of the average Social Security benefit -- here's how to change that.",
    "fullText": "To earn Social Security benefits, workers must reach an earnings benchmark during their career years and pay corresponding payroll taxes into the Social Security Administration (SSA). Other than self-employed workers, employees don't forward payroll taxes directly. Instead, employers withhold and pay an amount based upon each employee's compensation levels that SSA credits to the employee's account. To become eligible to receive Social Security retirement benefits, workers must earn 40 or more credits; since 1978, workers can earn up to four credits annually. So, someone might work ten years with maximum credits or more years with fewer annual credits to quality. The dollar amount needed to earn a credit may change annually: in 2025, earning $1,810 equalled one credit.\n\nThe amount of a person's check, however, is not based on credits earned. As described by SSA, the agency calculates a person's earnings over a 35-year period. SSA then adjusts those earnings to account for typical wage levels taking place during the person's employment years to determine that worker's indexed earnings. After SSA has gathered this information, the agency then focuses on years with the highest indexed earnings to calculate an average and the benefit amount. Higher earners will therefore receive bigger retirement checks from Social Security than lower earners. SSA doesn't directly label anyone as a lower earning retiree. If, though, this is defined as receiving less than the average Social Security income, as of August 2025, the SSA listed the average monthly benefit for retired workers as $2,008.31.\n\nIn 2024, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities — according to GOBankingRates reporting — defined low earners as people earning 45% less than the typical wage. Defined this way, the average annual Social Security benefit for lower earners who retired at age 65 came in at $14,824. Broken down, that's $1,235 monthly. As reported by SmartAsset, effective in 1972, very low-income workers could potentially benefit from a program that provides a Special Minimum Benefit based on working years rather than earnings. To qualify, the low-earning worker needs to work 11 or more years, paying in an undefined \"significant amount\" to the Social Security Trust Fund. Using 2025 figures, someone with 11 years of working experience would receive $52.10 monthly. To get the full special minimum benefit, someone must have worked 30 or more years. The benefit in 2025 would be $1,093.10.\n\nIf someone retires before their full retirement age, which currently ranges from 66 to 67, depending upon their birth year, they can still earn a certain amount of employment wages, although with potential negative tax consequences. In 2026, the Social Security earnings limit is increasing to $24,480. (This wouldn't have much of an income tax impact for those low earners who probably wouldn't earn this amount.) In general, if someone doesn't earn the current standard deduction amount, they may not even need to file a tax return. For a single taxpayer, in 2026, the standard deduction amount is $16,100.\n\nUnlock your financial potential. Add Money Digest to your preferred sources for smart money insights!",

    "title": "Pebble Is Releasing a $75 Ring, but It’s Not an Oura Competitor",
    "description": "The ring has a button for voice memos, but Pebble users don't seem too impressed.",
    "fullText": "When I hear that a smartwatch company is launching a ring, I assume it’s going to be a smart ring. But Pebble went a different direction, instead creating what’s basically a remote microphone that can work with your phone and other devices. It's available for pre-order for $75, and will sell for $99 after launch.\n\nPebble’s new ring is called the Index 01. It’s got a button you can click and hold, and a microphone that will listen to what you’re saying as you hold the button. The recording is then sent to your phone, where it’s processed on-device. That's it—no heart rate sensor, and no charging dock.\n\nEric Migicovsky, Pebble’s founder, describes using the Index to capture short messages and send instructions to his Pebble watch via his phone. The idea is that you wear the Index on your index finger (get it?) and press the button with your thumb. The ring comes in three colors: matte black with a black button, polished gold with a blue button, and silver with a white button.\n\nThere is no battery to charge, just a built-in battery that lasts a total of 12 to 15 hours. Migicovsky writes: “On average, I use it 10-20 times per day to record 3-6 second thoughts. That’s up to 2 years of usage.”\n\nThe ring doesn’t have a speaker and can’t vibrate for notifications; it’s just for input. Communication between the ring and your phone is encrypted, and the voice recordings are processed into text on your phone, without requiring an internet connection. The ring doesn’t talk directly to a Pebble watch, but it can talk to your phone and your phone can then display any output to the watch—for example, displaying the text of a reminder that you set.\n\nSo far, Pebble users don’t seem to be nearly as excited about this product as Migicovsky is. A Reddit thread discussing the announcement has comments like “Cool idea, weird product,” and “Why would I want this if I already have a Pebble that has all the capability to take voice notes?”\n\nMigicovsky explains in the company’s blog post that his goal was for the button to be operated with one hand, and gestures on the Pebble weren’t reliable enough. He also emphasizes the fact you don’t need to charge it, while some of the users seem to be more concerned that a device that can't be charged is basically disposable—\"manufactured e-waste.\"\n\nAfter about two years of use (or less, if you make longer recordings), the app will ask if you’d like to order another ring. The ring will cost $75 to pre-order, and $99 at its regular price. There hasn’t been any mention of a discounted rate for a replacement; it sounds like you’re supposed to buy a new $99 ring every two years.\n\nThe ring’s functionality could be extended in the future. A double click-and-hold could signal the Pebble app to process the data in a different way (perhaps sending it to ChatGPT, Migicovsky suggests) and developers could connect the voice processing in the app to other services like calendar and weather apps.",

    "description": "Watch these money traps that get away from Americans 65 and up.",
    "fullText": "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nThe average American 65 years of age and up earns an annual income of approximately $65,468 in Q3 2025 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) (1). The latest data, from 2023, shows that same group spends roughly $60,087 yearly, or about $4,622 a month, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (2).\n\nThat income doesn’t leave a lot of extra cash for unexpected expenses or emergencies. The average American aged 65-69 has about $200,000 in retirement savings, according to an analysis of the 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) data (3), and might still need to work even when they reach retirement age. High expenses often play a role.\n\nThese four categories of spending tend to eat into monthly expenses — here’s how you can shave some zeros off them.\n\nHome costs represent the largest expense for retirees, amounting to $21,445 of their annual expenses in 2023, according to the Consumer Expenditures Surveys (CE) (4). Retirees who want to gain a leg up may want to consider downsizing as house prices remain high.\n\nThat could mean selling your current home for a profit, relocating to a less expensive market or seeking out cooperative living situations with other retired couples.\n\nIf you’re keen on staying where you are, you can make living there less expensive by getting the best deal on home insurance.\n\nOfficialHomeInsurance's digital insurance marketplace compiles the best home insurance rates for your unique needs. In just two minutes OfficialHomeInsurance will round up a list of offers from leading insurers, potentially saving you saving you an average of $482 a year.\n\nIf you aren’t working as much – or at all – you might want to swap the car for public transit or a bicycle. Transportation is the second-largest spending category, making up $9,033 in annual expenses for retirees, according to CE figures.\n\nIf your partner has a car, consider getting rid of one vehicle to cut costs. Even if you own your auto outright, car insurance, maintenance and repair costs for two cars add up.\n\nWhether you keep multiple cars or just have one, you want to make sure you’re not overpaying for car insurance.\n\nIn just two minutes, you could find rates as low as $29 per month.\n\nHealth spending makes up $8,027 in annual spending for retirees. One way to cut costs when health issues arise is to get easily affordable preventative care. That means staying up to date on screenings and vaccinations.",

    "fullText": "MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A Wisconsin judge on Tuesday refused to step aside as requested by President Donald Trump's former attorney who faces felony forgery case related to the 2020 election in the battleground state.\n\nThe judge also refused to cancel a Monday preliminary hearing for Trump's former attorney, who also previously worked as a judge in the same county where he is being prosecuted, and two other former Trump associates.\n\nThe three former Trump aides face 11 felony charges each in relation to their roles in the 2020 fake elector scheme. They are: Jim Troupis, who was Trump’s attorney in Wisconsin in the 2020 election; Kenneth Chesebro, an attorney who advised Trump's campaign; and Mike Roman, Trump’s director of Election Day operations in 2020.\n\nTroupis, joined by the other two defendants, argued in a motion filed Monday that all of the judges in Dane County were biased against him. Troupis was a judge in the county for one year from 2015 to 2016.\n\nHe also alleged that the judge hearing his case, Dane County Circuit Judge John Hyland, had solicited help from a retired judge in writing an August order refusing to dismiss the case against him.\n\nTroupis argued in the motion that the retired judge who “carries personal animus” toward Troupis from their time together on the bench actually wrote the order. Troupis asked for an evidentiary hearing in another county.\n\nHe included an expert analysis of the writing style that compares the order to the writing style of retired Dane County Judge Frank Remington. Troupis' attorney also attached a Nov. 25 letter he wrote to Hyland claiming that other attorneys told him that Remington actually wrote the August order because the writing style matched Remington’s in a civil case they litigated before him.\n\nHyland rejected those arguments and Troupis' call for moving the case to another county.\n\n“The Court is satisfied that no person other the assigned staff attorney and I had a hand in drafting or editing the decision which this Court signed and entered,” Hyland wrote.\n\nHyland also wrote that he had “no personal animus or prejudice toward any of the litigants” and was satisfied that he could fairly hear the case. He declined to step aside as requested.\n\nHyland also said that Troupis presented no evidence to support his claim that every other judge in the country was prejudiced against him and therefore can’t fairly hear the case.\n\nTroupis’ attorney, Joe Bugni, did not respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nTroupis, Chesebro and Roman each face 11 felony charges for allegedly using forgery in an attempt to defraud each of the 10 Republican electors who cast their ballots for Trump in 2020 as part of a plan to submit paperwork falsely claiming that the Republican had won the battleground state that year.\n\nTrump lost Wisconsin in 2020 but fought to have the defeat overturned. He won the state in both 2016 and 2024.\n\nThe Wisconsin Department of Justice, which is prosecuting the case, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nThe state charges against the Trump attorneys and aide are the only ones in Wisconsin. None of the electors have been charged. The 10 Wisconsin electors, Chesebro and Troupis all settled a lawsuit that was brought against them in 2023.\n\nFederal prosecutors who investigated Trump’s conduct related to the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, said the fake electors scheme originated in Wisconsin.\n\nThe Wisconsin complaint details how Troupis, Chesebro and Roman created a document that falsely said Trump had won Wisconsin’s 10 Electoral College votes and then attempted to deliver the document to then-Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nThe Trump associates have argued that no crime took place. But the judge in August rejected their arguments in allowing the case to proceed.\n\nA judge threw out a similar case in Michigan in September. And last year, a special prosecutor dropped a federal case alleging Trump conspired to overturn the 2020 election. A Georgia election interference case was dropped by prosecutors earlier last month, and another similar case remains in Nevada.",

    "title": "The Out-of-Touch Adults' Guide to Kid Culture: 'Millennial Optimism'",
    "description": "Young people are longing for the good old days of 2012.",
    "fullText": "This week, young people are longing for a past they were barely alive for, roasting people who dare to read books in public, and sharing videos of the last moments their lives made sense. So, not exactly an uplifting collection of cultural observations, but I threw in some truly banger Christmas carol mashups to lighten the mood. Everything is nostalgic, melancholic, or festive—sometimes all at once.\n\nNostalgia for Y2K is dying out, replaced by romanticization of the years around 2010, which some younger people are imagining as a more innocent, hopeful time that they missed out on. At the same time, many millennials who were setting those trends then are feeling nostalgic for their lost youth, so both groups are posting TikTok videos about \"millennial optimism.\" You see, supposedly post-2010 was an era marked by whimsical possibility and confidence in a bright future, which is decidedly not how kids feel today. Thus: Nostalgia.\n\nHere are some examples of videos about the time, one made by a young person:\n\nSo is \"millennial optimism\" really a thing? Yes and no. While it's hard for an older person to see a decade that included both the fallout from the 2008 recession and the election of 2016 as the best of times, a youth living through our current nightmare might see it that way. And I'm sure many millennial hipsters were having a lovely time back in the late-aughts and teens, growing funny mustaches, going to farmer's markets, and listening to Stomp Clap Hey music.\n\nBut whatever fun and whimsy was on order back then wasn't because of some overall cultural optimism; it was because that's when millennials were young, and it's fun to be young. Also, the urban hipsters at the center of these memes were only a tiny percentage of the population; everyone else was just living their lives—which were, more or less, the same lives people have always led. Anyway, if young people you know start talking about the golden age of optimism that was 2010-2020, this is the context behind their understanding of the recent past. It's flawed, but nostalgia for times we didn't live always is.\n\nThe rise of the term \"performative reading\" could be seen as an indicator that the recent past was actually more optimistic. Performative reading was coined around 2020 and originally referred to people who read books in public as a social status indicator. You might know it better as “acting pretentious” or “being a pseudo intellectual.” As an insult toward people who use books as fashion accessories, \"performative reading\" wasn’t widely employed back then, but lately, the term is being connected to the insult “performative male,” and is often used to refer to young men who read books written by women authors in public in an attempt to get women to notice/like them. I don't think this actually a widespread trend—it feels like one of those things that is commented upon more often than actually happens. Regardless, the result is the worst type of people posting photos (that I won't link to) of \"performative readers\" they spot on subways and coffeeshops, so other horrible people can comment like, \"look at this jerk, readin' a book! Written by a woman!\"\n\nThis is troubling on many levels—it’s anti-intellectual, it's sexist, it's bullying, and it’s also part of a larger trend among generations Z and A, who seem reluctant to do anything out-of-the-ordinary for fear of being publicly judged and/or ridiculed for it online. Before everything was online, you could sit at a coffeeshop reading bell hooks and the worst you might have to deal with would have been a smirk from a stranger. Now, a picture of you in a beret could end up online with a hundreds of thousands of faceless strangers dunking on your pretentious ass. The result is a drop in the number of annoying urban attention seekers, but also a drop in the number of people who do anything interesting at all. So maybe nostalgia for the aughts antwenty-d teens is warranted.\n\nIn Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, the main character chases after a white rabbit and is led into a surreal, troubling world. That's the basis of the White Rabbit trend on TikTok. The idea is to post a video of yourself experiencing a moment of happiness right before the \"white rabbit\" appeared to change the trajectory of your life. It's the calm before the storm, the tragic equivalent of the \"photo taken moments before disaster\" meme, but with the confessional intimacy of TikTok. The melancholic mood is driven home by a soundtrack of a metronome counting down, accompanied by a baleful lo-fi piano riff.\n\nHere's an example, in which a TikToker posted a graduation walk, taken two days before her white rabbit showed up in the form of a serious car accident.\n\nMany white rabbit videos don't offer any context, leaving you to fill in the blanks:\n\nIt's not exactly an uplifting trend, but if you like the camaraderie of knowing you're not the only person whose life has been suddenly uprooted by forces beyond your control, you can check out over 200,000 videos that use the \"white rabbit\" audio.\n\nBack in my day, \"hemmy\" was a word gearheads used to describe the engines in Ram trucks, but among a growing number of young people, \"hemmy\" now means \"homie,\" but as said by a white person. The originator of the word is Milk, a fan-favorite character in Legends of Chamberlain Heights, an \"edgy,\" crudely animated cartoon that premiered on Comedy Central in 2016 and ran for two seasons.\n\nIt's Christmas, so let's check out some Christmas carols that are going viral. TikTok DJ Noteliwood is blowing up (as they used to say) for his holiday-themed mash-ups, like this collision of \"Linus and Lucy\" from the Vince Guaraldi Trio and and GloRilla's \"Yeah Glo!\" that I cannot stop listening to (along with 3.3 million other people):\n\nIf that's not enough to get you in the Christmas spirit, how about \"Money in the Sleigh,\" a mashup of Wham!'s \"Last Christmas\" and Drake's \"Money in the Grave\" that's closing in on four million streams:",

    "title": "Instagram May Be Quietly Adding AI-Generated Headlines to Your Posts",
    "description": "No one asked for this.",
    "fullText": "Few of us are under the illusion that we own the content that we post on Instagram, but we do get a say in how that content is presented—w can choose which photos and videos we share, what captions appear (or don't appear) on each post, as well as whether or not we include where the image was taken or shared from. We might not control the platform, but we do control the content of our posts—unless those posts are found on search engines like Google.\n\nAs reported by 404 Media, it appears that Instagram is experimenting with AI-generated SEO titles for users' posts—without those users' input or permission. Take this post for example: Author Jeff VanderMeer uploaded a short video of rabbits eating a banana to his Instagram. The video was posted as-is: There was no caption, location tag, or any other public-facing information. It's just a couple of rabbits having a bite.\n\nA post shared by Jeff VanderMeer (@jeff_vandermeer123)\n\nInstagram, however, took it upon itself to add a headline to the post—at least when you stumble upon it on via Google. Rather than display a link featuring Jeff's Instagram handle and some metadata about the video, the Google entry comes back with the following headline: \"Meet the Bunny Who Loves Eating Bananas, A Nutritious Snack for...\" (the rest of the headline cuts off here).\n\nVanderMeer was less than pleased with the discovery. He posted a screenshot of the headline to Bluesky, writing, \"now [Instagram] appears to generate titles [and] headlines via AI for stuff I post...to create [clickbait] for [Google] wtf do not like.\"\n\nThis was not the only AI-generated headline VanderMeer was roped into. This post from the Groton Public Library in Massachusetts, which advertises VanderMeer's novel Annihilation as the library's December book group pick, was also given the \"clickbait\" treatment on Google. Just as with VanderMeer's post, the Groton Public Library didn't include any text in its Instagram post—just an image showing off the book. But if you see the post within a Google search, you'll see the following partial headline: \"Join Jeff VanderMeer on a Thrilling Beachside Adventure with Mesta...\"\n\n404 Media's Emanuel Maiberg says that they've confirmed that Instagram is also generating headlines for other users on the platform, all without permission or knowledge. Meta did not return 404 Media's request for comment. (I have also reached out for comment.) Google, on the other hand, did return 404 Media's messages, and confirmed the headlines are not coming from its AI generators—though it has been using deceptive AI-generated headlines of its own on Google Discover. In fact, the company says its search engine is simply pulling the text from Instagram itself. Maiberg found that these headlines do appear under title tags for Instagram posts when using Google's Rich Result Test tool. When digging through the code, Maiberg also discovered AI-generated descriptions for each post, which could be what Instagram is ultimately using to generate the headlines.\n\nI'll update this post if I hear back from Instagram regarding these AI-generated headlines. Until then, I can only speculate on their intended purpose (assuming Instagram is the one generating these headlines in the first place). And the likeliest reason is to boost engagement: Instagram probably wants to increase the visibility of its users' posts in search, which means giving Google more information to work with. If the user doesn't provide their own details about the image, Instagram's AI appears to be filling in the blanks, first generating a description, and from there, sticking a \"clicky\" headline onto it.\n\nThe results aren't actually all that appealing, though. Just because Meta AI may be capable of generating headlines, doesn't mean it is good at it, or even that it should—especially when users never consented to this practice in the first place. It'd be one thing if Instagram had an option before you post—something like \"Generate a headline for me using Meta AI that will appear in search engines for my post.\" Most of us would opt out of that, but it'd at least be a choice. However, it appears that Instagram decided that users like VanderMeer weren't capable of writing a headline as clever as \"Meet the Bunny Who Loves Eating Bananas.\"\n\nThe worst part is, the AI doesn't even accurately describe the posts. That Groton Public Library post was only about a book club meeting featuring VanderMeer's novel, but the headline says \"Join Jeff VanderMeer,\" as if he'd be making an appearance. Not only did Instagram add a headline without VanderMeer's consent, it spread misinformation about his whereabouts. And for what? Some extra engagement on Google?\n\nIf Instagram wants its posts to appear as headlines on search engines, it should include the actual posters in the conversation. As VanderMeer told 404 Media: \"If I post content, I want to be the one contextualizing it, not some third party.\"",

    "title": "‘I’m desperately trying to do right by everyone’: I’m giving my son $250K and my daughter 50% of a rental we co-own. Is that fair?",
    "description": "“I am currently saving this money for him.”",
    "fullText": "Instead of giving my son a portion of some rental property I own 50/50 with my daughter,  I promised to give him $250,000 instead as an inheritance before I die.  The reason was simple: my son had no financial input into that property,\n\nI am currently saving this money for him. When the amount accrues to $250,000, including interest, do I give him that money or should he have the $250,000, plus whatever interest is paid? Obviously, I prefer the former scenario.\n\nNvidia’s stock rises as Trump blesses China sales. Here’s how big the opportunity could be.\n\nMy mother is selling my late father’s multimillion-dollar California real-estate portfolio — must I stand idly by?\n\nI’m desperately trying to do right by everyone. How do I make up for the equity in the property?\n\nIt may never be entirely equal. Whatever you decide, put it in writing.\n\nYour daughter invested in a house and, as you say, brought some of her own money. The house, given the long-term trajectory of the housing market, will increase in value. Your son has an opportunity to invest this $250,000 in the stock market or, perhaps, use it as seed money to buy a property of his own.\n\nIf you want to make sure each child gets exactly the same inheritance, down to the last red cent, you could give him the monetary equivalent of your share of the rental property, and allow your daughter to own the home outright. Forcing your daughter into becoming a joint landlord with her brother against her wishes and/or without her knowledge would be a weird flex, if you can afford to give your son the cash equivalent.\n\nThe clue is in your question: If the agreement was “I will give you $250,000…” then you should indeed gift him $250,000, with no additional interest on top. The interest is simply a method for you to accumulate the pledged amount. You are not functioning as a bank, and unless you promised him interest, he is not entitled to any. Ultimately, you want to ensure that they each receive a similar gift and/or inheritance.\n\nImagine you had entered into this real-estate transaction in 2009 and gifted your son $250,000. He would have made out like a bandit, given the fall in property prices, which took the best part of a decade to recover. You’re a generous parent, not a Federal Reserve committee member or a Nobel Prize-winning economist — and certainly not a fortune teller. Sometimes, non-cash inheritances leave a lot up to chance.",

    "description": "An infographics feature has arrived to Google's NotebookLM.",
    "fullText": "Another day, another update to Google's NotebookLM, the versatile AI tool that functions like a personal assistant focused only on you and your needs. The latest update is for visual learners: You can turn your source materials into helpful infographics that give you a clear picture—literally—of what the PDFs, websites, videos, or other materials you're studying or organizing are about.\n\nTo use the new feature, open any of your NotebookLM Notebooks (the name given to folders full of specific materials you've uploaded) and navigate to the panel on the right side. It's the same panel where you find the other offerings like the video creator and flashcard maker.\n\nAs with those tools, you just tap the associated button to generate the corresponding product, making sure the sources from your left panel that you want to include are all checked off. I tried it out this morning, first using the NotebookLM account associated with my personal Chrome profile and what I'm studying in my private life, then using the one I have set up for work, which has a tester notebook full of materials about how to study for the SAT. (I am strict about using different Chrome profiles for various parts of my life and am now up to seven.)\n\nIn my personal account, the button was labeled BETA—and it acted like it. After two failed attempts, NotebookLM could not produce an infographic based on my materials. In my work account, though, the beta label was missing and it performed the function just fine, spitting this out:\n\nThis is rolling out in full functionality to accounts at different times, obviously, but I was glad to see one of mine had easy access because I thought the infographic was solid.\n\nI don't consider myself a visual learner and primarily use NotebookLM to refine ideas or generate educational audio clips I can listen to while I clean the house, so I wasn't expecting to like this. I don't like the mind map creator within NotebookLM at all, for instance; flowcharts just aren't how I learn best, and that's fine.\n\nBut the infographic was concise, engaging, and just detailed enough to keep me interested and looking at it. It's unlikely I'll use this to study or refine my work often, but I can absolutely see how it would be useful to someone who learns more visually, especially if all the lines and boxes of a mind map can get too convoluted to be useful.",

So training is not there but obviously the fact that you are missing players, you are loading other players more [as] a consequence.

You start to ask them again and again and again to do that [and] at some point they will break down,\" he said.\n\n\"It's something that we are constantly looking at.

    "title": "2 huge earthquakes strike within days. Is it a warning?",
    "description": "The earthquakes are not believed to be connected. But they are a reminder of lurking danger.",
    "fullText": "Two earthquakes of a 7.0 or greater magnitude have struck within days of each other in Alaska and Japan, prompting worries another big temblor could be on the way.\n\nThe first quake hit in Alaska on Dec. 6 with a magnitude of 7.0, a major quake capable of producing serious damage if it hadn't happened in such a remote area near the Canada border. The second, a 7.6 mega-quake, hit northern Japan on Dec. 8, prompting tsunami warnings that were later lifted and causing at least 30 injuries. Tens of thousands evacuated their homes.\n\nAftershocks have been recorded for both earthquakes. On Dec. 8, Japanese authorities warned an even more powerful earthquake could strike within the next week and called on residents from the northernmost island of Hokkaido down to Chiba prefecture, east of Tokyo, to be on high alert.\n\nThe earthquakes were notable for their strength.\n\nIn an average year, the U.S. Geological Survey says about 16 major earthquakes are expected around the world, including 15 with a magnitude of 7.0 or higher and one 8.0 or higher. That's based on records dating back to about 1900. For the last four to five decades, the long-term average number of major quakes in a year has been surpassed about a dozen times.\n\nBut having two such quakes in a short period of time happens from time-to-time and doesn't necessarily signal another impending disaster.\n\n\"It's not all the time, but it's not that crazy,\" said Brandon Schmandt, professor at Rice University and seismology expert.\n\nIt's a reminder of an uncomfortable truth in earthquake science: Scientists know disastrous earthquakes are looming, but have no reliable way to predict when they will hit.\n\n\"No one can predict earthquakes. However, by investigating faults and past quakes, scientists can better assess the likelihood of future earthquakes and how intense their shaking might be,\" the USGS said.\n\n\"We average about one magnitude-7.0 per month somewhere in the world,\" Jones said.\n\nThe average of one per month is randomly distributed, Jones said. We might go several months without one, and then see multiple within a close span. Jones said she would estimate based on probabilities that paired magnitude-7 or higher earthquakes are likely to come within half a week of each other once every few years.\n\n\"It's not like it happens all the time, but we've looked for and can't find any physical correlation,\" she said.\n\nOne earthquake can trigger another, as in an aftershock, but that's not the relationship between the Alaska and Japan quakes, which appear to be wholly unrelated, Schmandt said. Aftershocks tend to happen in the same geographic area as the main earthquake.\n\nJones said there is about a 5% chance after any earthquake that another one will follow nearby within a few days that is bigger in magnitude. Though a 5% chance might not seem like much, it's a much greater than the baseline chances, and it's what's driving Japanese authorities to stay on high alert for the time being, she said.\n\nA recent example happened in 2019 near Ridgecrest, California, Jones noted. A 6.4-magnitude hit on the Fourth of July, and less intense aftershocks followed. Then, one day later, a 7.1 quake became the largest to strike Southern California in 20 years.\n\nMost of the United States is at risk for damaging earthquake shaking within the next century, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, which published a report last year that found hundreds of previously unidentified faults around the country.\n\nPeople in 37 states have experienced earthquakes with magnitudes of 5.0 or greater in the last two centuries, according to the USGS.\n\nThe danger is most concentrated along the West Coast and the southern part of Alaska, where the most active tectonic plate boundaries are found.\n\nConcerns of a so-called \"Big One\" event, a massive quake bringing untold devastation, have long rattled residents in these areas. It could happen at any time, or not for a long time, experts say. And there could be more than one \"Big One.\"\n\nThe Big One: Is California 'overdue' for a devastating major earthquake?\n\nSchmandt said the Cascadia Subduction Zone that stretches from Northern California up through Oregon and Washington and into Canada has the potential for a lurking event that could be considered \"the Big One.\" The last known quake in this fault happened in January 1700, with an estimated 9.0 magnitude, according to the Oregon Department of Emergency Management.\n\n\"Currently, scientists are predicting that there is about a 37% chance that a megathrust earthquake of 7.1+ magnitude in this fault zone will occur in the next 50 years. This event will be felt throughout the Pacific Northwest,\" the department said.\n\nAccording to Michigan Technological University, earthquake magnitudes can have the following effects:\n\n5.5 to 6.0: Slight damage to buildings\n\n7.0 to 7.9: Major earthquake. Serious damage\n\n8.0 or greater: Massive damage, can destroy communities\n\nContributing: Elizabeth Weise and Terry Collins, USA TODAY; Reuters\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Are the Alaska, Japan earthquakes a warning?",

    "fullText": "Who knows what the narrative would have been had Dominik Szoboszlai not converted from the penalty spot?\n\nThe noise surrounding Mohamed Salah would only have gotten louder. More dropped points for Liverpool without their star man.\n\nYet it was Liverpool's player of the season so far who took the responsibility from 12 yards out while the man who would have usually taken the penalty sat at home, almost 1000 miles away.\n\nThe sight of the players walking over to the away end and the travelling fans singing Arne Slot's name at the full-time whistle told you all you needed to know.\n\nAfter a horrid few days, Slot and Liverpool finally had something to smile about.\n\nThis was their fourth win at the San Siro in as many years but crucially their first away win in the Champions League without Salah since 2009.\n\nWhether or not it is a turning point for Slot and co remains to be seen but it certainly felt massive. Not least with Michael Edwards, the chief executive, in attendance in Milan.\n\nOn Monday, goalkeeper Alisson Becker insisted that the players were behind the manager after arguably the toughest spell of his career.\n\nOn the pitch, they delivered with an assured display after Slot's tactical tweaks and crucially kept a clean sheet following the capitulation at Leeds on Saturday.\n\nAbove all, the spirit and togetherness after a tumultuous 72 hours was notable. Liverpool travelled to Italy with a depleted 19-man squad and got the job done.\n\n\"It doesn't change anything. There's obviously so much noise from the outside world, which is normal when you don't perform,\" Virgil van Dijk told Amazon Prime Sport.\n\n\"It's deserved as well. We want to improve, we want to be consistent and win games. We're not doing it as much as we like. We have to stick together and be a unit as we have been. That's what Liverpool stands for.\n\nLeft-back Andy Robertson added: \"We all needed it. We know the results and performances aren't good enough. It's important that this club is in the Champions League. It was a huge result for all of us.\"",

    "description": "The Fed's final meeting of 2025 is expected to see a third interest rate cut from the central bank, with investors focusing on the outlook for 2026.",
    "fullText": "The Federal Reserve's final meeting of the year began on Tuesday morning, Dec. 9, with the central bank scheduled to announce its final monetary policy decision at 2:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nInvestors expect the Fed will cut rates by 0.25%, its third cut of the year, at the conclusion of its two-day meeting, with data from the CME Group showing a 90% chance the central bank will cut rates this week.\n\nAlong with its final policy decision of the year, the Fed will also publish its final Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) for 2025, which includes forecasts from Fed officials on economic growth, inflation, and interest rates for the coming years.\n\nIn September, the SEP showed the Fed's median forecasts calling for just one interest rate cut in 2026 following three reductions in 2025. Changes to this outlook will be top of mind for investors on Wednesday.\n\nInvestors will also be closely watching for further disagreement among Fed officials, as October's policy statement revealed two members of the FOMC voted against the decision to lower rates by 0.25%.\n\nUS stocks were little changed at Tuesday's close as traders bet that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to CME Group's FedWatch tool, traders assigned a 87.6% probability to the Fed cutting rates by 25 basis points, down marginally from odds placed on a cut a day ago.\n\nAlthough stocks were muted in the lead-up to the Fed decision, one strategist noted that Chair Jerome Powell's comments at the press conference will likely affect market sentiment heading into 2026.\n\n“A 25 basis point cut is important for investor sentiment, not necessarily for many of the companies that we invest in,\" Siebert Financial chief investment officer Mark Malek told Yahoo Finance about how the Fed decision could affect investments. \"This 25 basis points is not going to make or break a lot of these companies.\"\n\nBarring a major deterioration in the labor market, Malek expects the Fed to try to temper expectations for further rate cuts. That's why Powell's remarks on the labor market will be especially scrutinized, he said.\n\n\"It is important that the Fed is showing that they're concerned about the labor market,\" Malek said. \"It's good for the consumer to know that the Fed's got their backs, if people are worried about their jobs, or maybe they're going to pull back on spending after the holiday season.\"\n\nThe Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower short-term interest rates on Wednesday for the third time this year, affecting the interest consumers pay and receive on many of their accounts.\n\nYahoo Finance's Hal Bundrick breaks down how discounts to the federal funds rate will impact deposits, credit, and debt:\n\n2025 has been a year of modest earnings on deposit accounts. Another rate cut won't help.\n\nThe national average of interest paid on checking accounts has barely budged much this year and remains at 0.07%. Interest rates on savings accounts are only marginally better, remaining at 0.40%.\n\nImagine that moving even lower. Is it possible? Yes.\n\nStock prices often react to the Fed’s rate actions, but they are only one factor among many affecting the investing climate and stock prices.\n\nIf you intend to manage your investments to suit the current environment, keep watch on broader economic and corporate profit trends alongside interest rates. If you prefer to stay conservative, fill your portfolio with high-quality stocks that have proven themselves in all economic cycles.\n\nThen, wait patiently for long-term growth.\n\nRead more about how the Fed affects your money here.\n\nAs markets look ahead to the path of Federal Reserve policy in 2026, President Trump offered one clue in an interview with Politico released Tuesday.\n\nTrump responded “yes” when asked if quickly reducing interest rates would be a litmus test for his choice of central bank leader. Trump has a list of five candidates to replace current Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whose term expires in May 2026.\n\n“Yes. Well, this guy ... should too,” Trump said, referring to Powell. “I think he’s a combination of not a smart person and doesn’t like Trump.”\n\nStocks were muted at the market open on Tuesday after a Federal Reserve spokesperson confirmed the FOMC meeting was underway.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was flat and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.2%. All three indexes came off modest losses on Monday.\n\nTreasury yields steadied as investors awaited the release of jobs data and the Federal Open Market Committee's policy decision.\n\nThe benchmark 10-year yield (^TNX) fell 2 basis points to 4.14%. Meanwhile, the 30-year yield (^TYX) declined 3 basis points to 4.78% after hitting its highest level in about three months on Monday.\n\nRead more about today's market action here.\n\nThe consensus around the Federal Reserve’s policy move on Wednesday has firmed around a 25 basis point rate cut — even if the decision will be a close one, as Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger details.\n\nTraders are pricing in an 89% chance that the Fed lowers interest rates by 25 basis points at the conclusion of the FOMC meeting on Wednesday, according to CMEGroup's FedWatch.\n\nBut looking ahead to the January meeting and 2026 broadly, the path is even less certain.\n\nOne widely held view is that the Fed will move forward with a \"hawkish cut\" on Wednesday, in which the central bank lowers rates but hints at a pause in January, JPMorgan’s Michael Feroli wrote in a Dec. 5 note. Traders have put a 23% probability that the Federal Reserve will continue cutting rates at its Jan. 27-28 meeting.\n\n“At the press conference, we expect that Powell will stress that with policy rates close to neutral, the time for risk management cuts is past and that further cuts would only come with a material deterioration in the labor market,” Feroli wrote.\n\n\"We don’t expect him to comment directly on January,\" Feroli added, \"but instead to highlight that there is a lot of data to be released between now and the January meeting and that will guide their decision.\"\n\nFor the remainder of the year, views range from the Fed cutting rates at its next few policy meetings due to a deterioration in the labor market to additional rate cuts in the summer due to a change in Fed leadership.\n\nRead more about 2026 predictions for Federal Reserve policy here.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's eventful 2025 wraps up this week, and another 0.25% rate cut is expected.\n\nBut the real drama in the central bank's release will be in how much agreement, or not, there is with this decision.\n\nAs Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger noted in her preview of the event, at least three regional Fed presidents have signaled that the case for cutting rates this week does not appear obvious. One of those includes Kansas City Fed president Jeff Schmid, who voted against October's rate cut.\n\nAdd in that Fed Governor Stephen Miran has twice dissented in favor of a larger rate cut, the central bank could be looking at upward of four votes against the expected decision to lower rates by another 0.25% on Wednesday.\n\nRead Jennifer's full preview of the meeting here.",

    "description": "Eden Castleberry has sued Indian Hill schools alleging that her 9-year-old son was racially harassed and ultimately attacked on a school playground.",
    "fullText": "The mother of an Indian Hill Elementary School student who filed a federal lawsuit alleging that her son was racially harassed and beaten by a handful of students was barred from school property hours after a meeting that led the school's principal to call police, according to public records obtained by The Enquirer.\n\nPolice reports say the directive prohibiting Eden Castleberry from being on any school property without prior authorization was the result of \"multiple incidents\" during which she acted \"in an aggressive and inappropriate manner” toward staff.\n\nBut Castleberry's attorney said the police reports are not accurate.\n\n\"Eden has no history of aggressive behavior with the district or law enforcement and has never even received a warning,\" her attorney, Robert Thompson, said in an emailed response to questions.\n\n\"Any suggestion that her presence that morning was an 'in person confrontation' that justified banning her from school property misstates her conduct and the context,\" Thompson said. \"We are concerned that the school district’s response was not driven by any aggressive behavior by Eden, but rather is consistent with retaliation after she raised safety concerns and advocated for her son and other children.\"\n\nCastelberry's lawsuit, filed Nov. 19 against the district, Indian Hill Football Club and numerous school staff, says that her son, Will J, was racially harassed, ambushed after a football practice and then, on Oct. 28, attacked, called racial slurs and injured by several students on a school playground.\n\nTwo days after the playground incident, Castleberry went to the school. Thompson said that a social worker and others at Cincinnati Children's, where Will J was treated for a concussion, bruised ribs and wrists, among other injuries, told Castleberry \"that she needed to go to the school in order to press charges regarding the attack on her son.\"\n\nThe police reports, which The Enquirer obtained through a public records request, indicate that the school's principal, Whitney Buell, called police about \"an upset parent\" the morning of Oct. 30 after Castleberry went to the school.\n\nSometime after 9 a.m. that day, Indian Hill officers were directed to a conference room where Castleberry was talking to the district’s chief human resources officer.\n\nIndian Hill Officer Ryan Camardo told Castleberry, according to the reports, “We (will) not be arresting 9-year-olds” because they were too young.\n\nCastleberry \"disagreed,\" according to the reports, and said her attorney had told her charges should be filed.\n\nCamardo then contacted the assistant prosecutor at the Hamilton County Prosecutor’s Office who heads the juvenile division. According to the reports, Assistant Prosecutor Linda Scott said children that young cannot have criminal intent “and confirmed that the children involved would not be charged.\"\n\nThe reports say a school district official told Castleberry that the school “imposed appropriate disciplinary action” against the students involved.\n\nBut according to Thompson, Castleberry arrived at the school around 8:30 a.m., and she asked police to be present \"because her sole purpose was to file the report and then leave.\"\n\n\"Her goal was to seek appropriate accountability for what happened to her child, not to create a confrontation,\" Thompson said.\n\nTexts obtained through a public records request show that Buell filed an internal report about Castleberry's Oct. 30 visit to the school. In the text exchange with an unnamed person, Buell said she would not get \"into the weeds of the fight\" involving Will J in the report.\n\nBuell, who is listed as a defendant in the federal lawsuit, also said none of the kids the district identified as being involved in the attack would be named in the report she made Oct. 30.\n\nThat same day, Castleberry was formally barred from all Indian Hill schools at the request of Superintendent Kirk Koennecke. She is only permitted on school property for drop off and pick up or with prior authorization.\n\nThe timing of the directive froze Castleberry's ability to advocate for her 9-year-old son because of the severity of injuries he got in the October attack, the lawsuit says.\n\nCastleberry said the playground attack was the culmination of more than a year of racially charged harassment against Will J, who is of mixed race.\n\nIt began in the fall of 2024. Three white students, two of whom were the sons of coaches of Will J's club football team, repeatedly called him \"monkey,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\nThen a year later, on Sept. 18, 2025, two of Will J's football teammates, who are white, “ambushed” him after football practice, the lawsuit says. One charged at him and slammed him to the ground; the other grabbed his head and repeatedly slammed it into the ground, then began choking him while he was pinned down.\n\nAmong the claims is that Buell told Castleberry that the school wasn't responsible because the attack happened after practice for a club team not affiliated with the school. The lawsuit also alleges that the club team's coach didn't take appropriate action.\n\nAfter the Sept. 18 incident, Castleberry advertised a \"Protect Your Kids\" protest at a fourth grade football game at Indian Hill High School. According to screenshots of emails and a Facebook post obtained through a public records request, Castleberry said she hoped to expose the district and the football club's efforts to minimize the the incident at practice.\n\n\"This message is to every parent out there. Please protect (your) sons especially at practices. The schools and the clubs should do our children better,\" Castleberry said in an email obtained through a public records request.\n\nThompson said Castleberry organized the protest because she had become extremely concerned about student safety in the district \"and what she perceived as an inadequate response to serious issues affecting children.\n\n\"The purpose was to raise awareness and to advocate for better protection of students,\" he said. \"It was focused on safety and accountability for children, not on personal attacks against staff.\"\n\nCastleberry has been active in the district as a parent, serving as a chaperone on class trips and coaching recreational basketball, according to Thompson. She also runs a youth basketball program.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cincinnati Enquirer: Indian Hill schools barred mom for her response to her son's attack",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had no time to hold a traditional news conference during a whirlwind, 36-hour trip across Europe this week, so he improvised.\n\nFor the first time since Russia's full-scale invasion of his country, Zelenskyy — who usually takes reporters’ questions in person while trotting the globe — communicated with the news media via group chat. While flying between London and Brussels, he answered a long list of questions from Ukrainian and international reporters, relaying audio clips on WhatsApp.\n\nHis chosen mode of communication was, if not unprecedented, at the very least extremely rare for a world leader.\n\nThe low drone of the aircraft blended with his hoarse, tired-sounding voice, yet his message cut through clearly: Amid uncertain negotiations to end the war, Ukraine, he said, cannot surrender land.\n\n“Undoubtedly, Russia insists for us to give up territories,” he said in a crackling message late Monday. “According to the law, we don’t have such a right … and to be frank, we don’t have a moral right either.”\n\nWith the outlook for negotiations changing by the day, Zelenskyy’s team set out on a jam-packed schedule to shore up support in Europe.\n\nZelenskyy met the leaders of Britain, Germany and France in London, and the heads of NATO and the European Union in Brussels, before traveling on to Rome for talks with the Italian prime minister and Pope Leo XIV.\n\nA key issue being discussed is whether Ukraine should cede Russian‑occupied territory in return for security guarantees, but the talks have been complicated by uncertainty about the Trump administration’s commitment to European security.\n\nSince the start of the war, Zelenskyy has shown a desire to communicate in real-time in whatever way is necessary.\n\nWhen Kyiv came under siege shortly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, Zelenskyy tried to reassure the public through what appeared to be a cellphone video with three top officials — perhaps his best-known address.\n\n“We are all here,” he said at the time. “Our soldiers are here, the citizens of our country are all here protecting our independence, and we are going to continue to do so.”\n\nSince then, Zelenskyy has made frequent communication a strategic priority in a sleep-defying cycle of video messages, remote speeches to Western parliaments and conferences, late-night posts and high-security public appearances.\n\nMonday night’s WhatsApp exchange wound down as his plane landed in Brussels, just before he was whisked into his next round of meetings.\n\nHe asked reporters: “How did you like this format? If it works for you, then when we have the opportunity, we’ll share our thoughts and decisions this way again.”\n\nIt didn't take long. By Tuesday evening, Zelenskyy had sent reporters more audio messages on WhatsApp to explain how talks to end the war were proceeding with its Western allies.",

    "fullText": "LAS VEGAS (KLAS) — Officials have identified some of the more than 300 piles of cremated remains located in the desert outside of Las Vegas.\n\nThe 8 News Now Investigators first reported the discovery of more than 100 piles of cremated remains in August. The person who found the ashes later contacted 8 News Now and said he stumbled on the piles on July 28 in a desert area outside of Searchlight. Searchlight is a rural community about an hour south of the Las Vegas valley off U.S. 95.\n\nIn August, a Bureau of Land Management official confirmed the piles were human cremains and that the department was actively investigating. “Cremains,” the term the official provided, refers to human cremated remains. What are generally referred to as “ashes” are pulverized bone, which are left over after a person is cremated.\n\nIn late October, representatives from Palm Mortuaries and Cemeteries removed approximately 315 piles from the desert. A second area containing more piles was found near the dump site in the 8 News Now Investigators’ original report.\n\nAs of Wednesday, officials identified three of the 315 piles, officials said. It was unlikely that more identifications would be forthcoming. Officials declined to comment further, citing the open investigation.\n\nThere is no law in Nevada barring a person from scattering ashes on public land. State law requires funeral operators to preserve the “dignity” of any remains in their care. BLM policy allows for a person to scatter cremated remains; however, the policy limits “commercial distribution of cremated remains.” A mass dumping site, like this one, violates federal law.\n\nPalm was in the process of placing the remains in a crypt.\n\nSeveral sources have suggested to the 8 News Now Investigators that the remains came from a recently closed funeral home and that they were years unclaimed. A representative from that business, which is headquartered out of state, has repeatedly denied any involvement.\n\nTips can be submitted to the BLM at blm_law_enforcement@blm.gov.\n\n8 News Now Investigator David Charns can be reached at dcharns@8newsnow.com.",

    "fullText": "King Charles is a step closer to saying goodbye to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s kids before it’s too late.\n\nThe Sun reported on December 7 that Harry had a major win in his ongoing case to restore his security in the United Kingdom after he lost the taxpayer-funded benefit after he and his wife, Meghan Markle, stepped down as senior members of the British royal family and moved to the United States in 2020. According to The Sun, a review of Harry’s security by the official body that assesses how royals and VIPs are guarded is now underway by the U.K. government.\n\nHarry's Ex's Friend Called Their Breakup the 'Best Thing That Ever Happened to Her' Right Before Reports the Prince Saw Her as the '1 Person Who Really Understood' Him\n\nThe Sun also reported that evidence has already been collected by Harry’s team, the police, and the government, and any decision around Harry’s security will be known in January 2026. “The UK Government’s protective security system is rigorous and proportionate. It is our long-standing policy not to provide detailed information on those arrangements, as doing so could compromise their integrity and affect individuals’ security,” a U.K. government spokesperson said in a statement at the time.\n\nThe update means Harry, who has said that he doesn’t feel safe bringing Meghan and his two children, Archie and Lilibet, back to the U.K. unless they had security, is one step closer to reuniting his father, King Charles, with his grandchildren. According to BBC, Charles hasn’t seen Lilibet and Archie in person since the Sussexes’ visit to the U.K. in 2022 for the Platinum Jubilee.\n\nThe update also comes after Charles and Harry reunited for the first time in years during a meeting in September, which was seen as a “massive step” forward in their estrangement, according to People. The update also comes as a source told Us Weekly in December that Charles is viewing his 2025 Christmas celebration as his “last” holiday after he was diagnosed with cancer in 2024.\n\n“Charles prioritizes duty, but he’s also a family man who knows his time is precious,” the insider said. “He wants a special last Christmas in case it’s his last.”\n\nFor Charles’ “last Christmas,” the insider reported that the king planned on taking his St. Mary Magdalene Church on Christmas morning and recording his Christmas speech, which airs later that afternoon to million of listeners. “Nothing would stop Charles from doing that,” the insider said. “He will do everything expected of him and more.” Another source added, “His health isn’t the best.

    "description": "Carrie was married to Mitt's older brother, who filed for divorce months prior to her death",
    "fullText": "The County of Los Angeles Department of Medical Examiner has determined the cause of death for former U.S. Sen Mitt Romney's late sister-in-law, Carrie Elizabeth Romney\n\nCarrie died on Oct. 10 after she fell from a parking garage in California\n\nMitt said in a statement at the time that his family was \"heartbroken\" by her death\n\nA cause of death has been determined for Carrie Elizabeth Romney, the sister-in-law of former U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney.\n\nThe County of Los Angeles Department of Medical Examiner (DME) said on Tuesday, Dec. 9, that they determined Carrie had died as a result of blunt traumatic injuries. She was injured after falling from the roof of a parking garage in Valencia, Calif., on Oct. 10. The DME also noted that Carrie's death was a suicide. She was 64 years old.\n\nA rep for Mitt, 78, did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comment.\n\nA Los Angeles County Sheriff’s representative previously told PEOPLE that law enforcement responded to a call at about 8:30 p.m. PT on the night of Carrie's death and arrived at a Valencia parking garage located at the 24500 block of Town Center Drive, where they identified her body.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Sheriff’s representative told PEOPLE that a woman had jumped or fallen from the parking garage, which is five stories and near a Hyatt Regency hotel, as reported by NBC Los Angeles.\n\nIn a statement shared with PEOPLE shortly after Carrie's death, Mitt said, \"Our family is heartbroken by the loss of Carrie, who brought warmth and love to all our lives. We ask for privacy during this difficult time.\"\n\nMonths before Carrie's death, her husband George \"Scott\" Romney — Mitt's older brother — filed for divorce, according to court documents obtained by PEOPLE.\n\nThe filing showed that Scott, 84, filed on June 10 to divorce Carrie, who was his third wife. The filing cited May 25 as the couple's date of separation and named \"irreconcilable differences\" as the reason for their split.\n\nIn his filing, Scott asked the judge to eliminate potential spousal support for both himself and Carrie during divorce proceedings or at any point in the future. He noted, \"most of the assets and debts of the parties are separate property and were accumulated before marriage.”\n\nCarrie indicated to the court that she would no longer use the Romney surname after the divorce. Paulina Markey, Carrie's attorney, confirmed to PEOPLE that the divorce was not finalized at the time of Carrie's death.\n\nShe said in a statement, \"This is an immensely difficult time for Ms. Romney’s loved ones, and the family has requested privacy as they grieve. We extend our deepest condolences to them during this time.\"\n\nScott's attorney, Karen L. Goldman, previously told PEOPLE when reached for comment, \"My client has not authorized me to make any comments to media during this difficult and tragic time.\"\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nScott and Carrie wed on Nov. 16, 2016, and had no children together. Scott was married to his first wife, Ronna Romney, from 1967 to 1992, and was with his second wife, Sheri Jelalian, from 2011 to 2016.\n\nScott is a father to seven children from his previous marriages. One of his children is former Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with mental health challenges, emotional distress, substance use problems, or just needs to talk, call or text 988, or chat at 988lifeline.org 24/7.",

    "description": "Chris...",
    "fullText": "Democratic Representative Shri Thanedar has filed articles of impeachment against the secretary of defense over the murderous attacks on boats in the Caribbean.\n\nAs Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth becomes more deeply mired in the scandal surrounding the military strikes against alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean, familiar refrains of Beltway discourse have lurched into gear. Democrats in Congress, for instance, are issuing calls for greater “transparency” and official “accountability” and vowing to widen the probes into the murderous attacks.\n\nThere is certainly much to investigate about Hegseth, who appears to have issued a second order to kill two stranded survivors in the first strike, and then proceeded to lie about doing so. Yet, amid the well-worn rounds of congressional inquiries and special investigations, Justice Department task forces, military probes, and international court proceedings, a cabinet criminal’s forcible removal from office is an all-but-guaranteed non-result. That’s why it’s so maddening that Democratic lawmakers have largely balked at invoking the most effective tool to secure such accountability—a motion to impeach Hegseth.\n\nIt’s hard to think of a case where impeachment would be a more appropriate remedy. After all, if murder doesn’t qualify as a “high crime and misdemeanor,” what does? And an impeachment inquiry, closely targeted on documenting criminal charges, would be an encouraging first step in holding Hegseth accountable for his conduct in an actually meaningful way.\n\nOf course, an allied piece of conventional Beltway wisdom is that impeachments are inherently political—and therefore politically risky. And few Beltway operators are more conventional than the Democrats’ terminally risk-averse House leader, Hakeem Jeffries. So it wasn’t shocking when Jeffries made a point of ruling out an official impeachment inquiry not long after news of Hegseth’s role in the second strike first broke. Jeffries claimed that planned investigations by the House and Senate Armed Services Committees should produce “a meaningful investigation which we can hope would be bipartisan”—while also claiming that House Republican leaders were far too partisan to permit any impeachment articles to make it onto the legislative calendar.\n\nLeaving aside the plain self-contradictory nature of Jeffries’s stand, the mechanism of impeachment isn’t actually as cumbersome as he makes it out to be. Under Rule IX of the House, any member can bring a motion to impeach a member of the executive branch under a privileged vote—meaning that House leaders in either major party don’t need to approve it in advance. Once an impeachment resolution is introduced under Rule IX, the House has a two-day window to vote on it, in a straight up-or-down balloting—or else to endorse another resolution to dismiss the impeachment one.\n\nThis is precisely the course of action that Michigan Democratic Representative Shri Thanedar is now pursuing against Hegseth. On Tuesday, Thanedar announced that he had filed articles of impeachment against Hegseth.\n\nJust introduced House Resolution 935, Impeaching Peter B. Hegseth, Sec. of Defense for high crimes and misdemeanors.\n\nThanedar’s motion cites both the second strike carried out on September 2 and the recent damning Pentagon investigation into Hegseth’s unauthorized sharing of details of a bombing raid in Yemen on an unsecure Signal group chat. “Here’s a secretary of defense who is managing a trillion-dollar budget, sending people into harm’s way, and he needs to be acting responsibly,” Thanedar said in an interview with The Nation. “The fact that he gives out war plans on a Signal chat puts our service members in grave danger.”\n\nAs for the Caribbean strike, Thanedar added, “Really, this is murder; it has nothing to do with drugs and protecting the United States”—noting as well that President Donald Trump has recently pardoned former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernandez, who was convicted of trafficking some 450 tons of cocaine into the United States.\n\nThe first article in Thanedar’s resolution charges Hegseth with “murder and conspiracy to murder,” bypassing the more vague and euphemistic suggestion in most mainstream press reports that he may be guilty of “war crimes.” (An ancillary problem with this phrasing is that there is no declared war, or even a similarly euphemized “police action” that governs the US military’s rules of engagement in jury-rigged, barely rationalized attacks that are themselves illegal.) The article specifies that, in the September 2 attack, “in compliance with the order of Peter B. Hegseth, the Armed Forces carried out a second strike with the express, willful, and deliberate purpose of killing the shipwrecked survivors of the first strike,” citing provisions in the Defense Department’s Law of War Manual that proscribe actions that deprive survivors of quarter after attack—let alone actions that kill them outright after an initial attack. The second article calls for Hegseth to be impeached and removed from office for circulating the plans for the Yemen strike on the Signal group chat last spring.\n\nGiven that leaders in both parties want nothing to do with it, Thanedar’s resolution might not ultimately travel too far. But there’s a great deal to be said for simply initiating a serious discussion of Hegseth’s impeachment on the Hill. To begin with, an impeachment resolution represents a come-to-Jesus moment for all members of Congress to take a clear stand on Hegseth’s actions. For Democrats in particular, the continued invocation of the Trump White House’s criminal trespasses and threats to democratic self-rule start to ring hollow in the absence of clear measures to attach tangible consequences to the perpetrators. “That’s what makes them look weak,” said a consultant familiar with the Thanedar resolutions, who requested anonymity to speak candidly. “I’ve heard it before— it’s a bit of a DC elite bubble thing to say, ‘Oh, the last impeachments backfired or failed.’ But it’s not true—the Democrats didn’t really pay any price at the ballot box” after their successive bids to impeach Trump in 2019 and 2021. “I think you can’t go out there and say, ‘They’re criminals and [Trump’s] trying to be a dictator,’ which is true and important, without something to back it up. And it’s not like they’d be taking a run at this at a time when he’s at an even split in the polls; he’s got a 20 percent disapproval gap.”\n\nThat’s a key reason that, even before they were formally introduced, Thanedar’s articles of impeachment got resounding endorsements from members of the Democratic Party’s activist base. “Pete Hegseth is an incredibly unqualified Christian nationalist lackey and alleged abuser who never should have been nominated in the first place,” said Hunter Dunn, a spokesperson for the 50501 movement, which has been instrumental in organizing the successful wave of No Kings protests across the country. “His support of Russia’s war crimes, the Genocide in Gaza, his role in Signalgate, his attempts to censor press, and his overall incompetence would each be reason enough for his removal. After he murdered multiple sailors in the Caribbean, the only place he belongs is in a jail cell. As such, we’re working on a number of different avenues to push towards his ousting, including having our members contact congressional representatives and lobby for impeachment, leveraging our social media platforms to build public support for an investigation into Hegseth and his removal, and targeted demonstrations.” Thanedar, who had earlier sought to initiate an Article IX impeachment measure against Trump until Democratic leaders prevailed on him to withdraw it, is now looking for a better reception from the party’s rank-and-file members, together with some possible recruits from the chamber’s increasingly fractious GOP majority. “What we saw from the Epstein files vote was that Republicans are now willing to question this president, and are willing to go against him on the right issue.” And if nothing else, he added, a Hegseth impeachment vote should supply a record to keep organizing around. “The question is not ‘What is the politics?’ or ‘What do the polls say?’ It’s more about, “Does this amount to a crime?’ If it does, then we need to do what is right…. This puts members of Congress on notice to take a stand. That’s what we’re elected to do.”",
