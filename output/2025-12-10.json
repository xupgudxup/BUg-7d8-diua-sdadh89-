    "fullText": "The Avs had an opportunity to be the first team to 50 points tonight, but ultimately, they drop their second loss of the road trip in the shootout to the Nashville Predators 4-3, finishing their east coast trip 2-1-1.\n\nBrock Nelson starts out the scoring with a beautiful deke and a shot that cracks Jusse Saros early. Unfortunately, Scott Wedgewood, in his first game back has a few not-so-good bounces that lead to goals. Jonathan Marchessault capitalizes on a poorly-tracked puck, and Reid Schaefer catches a stagnant Wedgewood to find the league.\n\nArtturi Lehkonen keeps the Avs from heading into the first intermission down and ties it up to make it 2-2 heading into the second period.\n\nA second period that ends scoreless, a ‘no goals’ commercial come to life. The Avs drew a few power plays, but nothing comes of them, and they head into the third on a split power play.\n\nThe third period goes scoreless until just above the seven-minute mark. Wedgewood looks much better in this period, making the first initial saves, but the Preds get it back out high and Brady Skjei finds a lane through traffic (thanks to an unfortunate screen from Sam Malinski) to put Nashville back in the lead.\n\nFear not, with eight seconds left, Cale Makar finds his first goal on the power play in a while, and they grab a point out of a game that they maybe didn’t deserve to.\n\nOvertime is scoreless, but Ryan O’Reilly scores first in the shootout, and he’ll be the lone shootout scorer to push Nashville to win 4-3.\n\nI think he picked up his performance as the game went on, and there’s certainly a conversation to be had about defensive coverage…\n\nBut as far as routine saves go, seems like the two Nashville scored in the first were fairly textbook.\n\nIf at first you don't score, shoot again! pic.twitter.com/hjh5tISYc4\n\n— Nashville Predators (@PredsNHL) December 10, 2025\n\nAnd I get it, right. This is Wedgewood’s first game back since his injury (back tightness per Coach Jared Bednar). Totally fine, especially considering he earned this game back a bit with his performance in the third period. But if you track the puck on the first goal better and lateral movement isn’t nonexistent on the second goal, this game is infinitely easier for the Avs.\n\nDoesn’t help that concussion spotters pull him after Filip Forsberg’s shootout attempt… So, the Avs may have another Wedgewood injury to worry about.\n\nI mean, Cale Makar finally getting his first power play goal since April 3rd, 2025 is an accomplishment, sure. That’s also a goal at 6-on-4, so I’m not counting that one (as pretty as it might be).\n\n8 WITH 8 SECONDS TO GO🥬 pic.twitter.com/iiKIgWeFQ2\n\n— Colorado Avalanche (@Avalanche) December 10, 2025\n\nThis game has an entirely different identity if the Avs can convert on one of the three 5-on-4 opportunities they had in the second period.\n\nI’m not even sure what has to change, except for maybe putting more than just seven shots on goal in six minutes of having a man-advantage.\n\nUltimately, it’s the power play that saves them, but with the third-period lull, you have to get more out of your units in a game like this.",

    "fullText": "Knicks fans think a Giannis Antetokounmpo trade is guaranteed because of a misleading viral tweet originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New York Knicks are rumored to be interested in a trade for Milwaukee Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo. The rumor mill was once again ignited after a misleading yet viral post started gaining traction on the internet.\n\nA X user named @BigKnickEnergy_ posted an update, claiming that the Bucks star has just purchased a home in New York. The post has received over 400K impressions within a few hours. Naturally, some were made to believe that it suggests that the Greek Freak was considering a move to New York.\n\nHowever, it didn't take long to figure out why the post was false. The update came with a screenshot that had 18th Nov, 2025, as the date of purchase. That was almost a month ago.\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo just purchased a home in New York 😮😮 pic.twitter.com/tvsPYuzCOj\n\n— Big Knick Energy (@BigKnickEnergy_) December 9, 2025\n\nYes, he did purchase a property, but over a month ago.\n\nThe Bucks star splurged $14.1 million to acquire a 28-unit residential building at 111 Clarkson Avenue, in the Prospect Lefferts Gardens neighborhood of Brooklyn. It is an eight-story apartment building built in 2018. All 28 units in the building are rent-regulated, and the building has an existing tax-abatement benefit under a 421-a program.\n\nIt's a real estate investment with the intention to generate cash flow rather than a personal residence. The building joins his investment portfolio.\n\nMeanwhile, as far as the trade rumors tying Giannis to the Knicks are concerned, the parties were closer in August. Antetokounmpo confided in at least one Bucks teammate that he saw the Knicks as a preferred trade destination. Even the Bucks reportedly asked the Knicks to present them with offers involving the former NBA champion. However, it seems the negotiations or the offers were not enough for a deal to come through.\n\nKnicks’ Josh Hart says he and the Knicks are taking the NBA Cup seriously\n\nKnicks guard Tyler Kolek reveals how he spent NBA Cup prize money\n\nKnicks' Karl-Anthony Towns gets positive injury designation ahead of matchup vs, Raptors",

(Photo by Carl Recine/Getty Images)\n\n‘It’s really disappointing,’ Cole told TNT Sports after Chelsea’s 2-1 defeat at Atalanta. ‘Chelsea matched them comfortably in the first half and took the lead.\n\n‘But they looked shaky after that and the frailties are clearly there. It’s frustrating.\n\n‘The performances against Barcelona and Chelsea were statements but they’ve followed that up with three below-par performances where the standards haven’t been there.\n\n‘I just keep coming back to it, I feel like there needs to be a bit more experience in the squad to help the team get through these tricky games.\n\n‘The coaches would have told them what to expect tonight and at Elland Road but there’s something about having an experienced player in your team to get you through.\n\n‘Chelsea are just not quite there yet. There’s promise and some great performances but then there’s performances like tonight which drop off.\n\n‘It makes this weekend very, very important because that’s four games without a win now. The Everton game is must-win.’",

    "fullText": "Last season, when Ruben Amorim stepped into the Manchester United hotseat, he increasingly relied on the club’s youth to bail the team out of danger.\n\nHe handed debuts to Chido Obi, Tyler Fredricson, and Harry Amass, and at one stage, the Red Devils were second in the list for minutes afforded to teenagers.\n\nBut this season, the head coach has hardly put his faith in Carrington graduates, as Kobbie Mainoo will attest to.\n\nRather surprisingly, despite the obvious lack of quality on the left flank, the 20-time English league champions opted to send Amass out on loan to Sheffield Wednesday, while choosing to keep new recruit Diego Leon at the club.\n\nThe Paraguayan has not managed to make his first team debut, and has looked raw when playing for the U21s, and there are plans to loan him out in January.\n\nInterestingly, Amass’ loan contract with the Owls includes a break clause. The Championship side are desperate to keep him at the Hillsborough Stadium, but United want to revise certain terms before agreeing an extension.\n\nAs revealed by The Daily Mail, there is plenty of interest in the ex-Watford starlet’s services from both the Premier League and Championship.\n\nHarry Amass has two years left on his current United contract, and his parent club have been in touch over a new and improved long-term deal.\n\n“The phone has been ringing off the hook with loan interest from Premier League clubs and Championship rivals, United need to weigh up what their longer term plan is for the teenager – and how that impacts his contract.\n\n“The key word from sources on this one is ‘patience’. While there is optimism that Amass, 18, can remain at Hillsborough for the remainder of the season, and Wednesday’s head of recruitment Kevin Beadell is in talks with United, Confidential understands that nothing has been decided right now.\n\n“Amass has two years remaining on his deal at United, and while talks are ongoing about what the second half of the season holds, part of the discussions has also centred around a potential new and improved contract.”\n\nHis Player of the Month award at Sheffield Wednesday shows how quickly he has taken to life in the second division. United should ideally look to agree a new long-term deal and send him to a higher-placed Championship side or possibly even a Premier League team in the bottom half of the table.\n\nFeature image Matt McNulty via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "As we continue our build up to the visit of Newcastle, which of the Lads could be key to our chances on Sunday?",
    "fullText": "Well, just to start off, I’m absolutely bricking it. I always do, and I always will before the derby.\n\nOur main threat against Newcastle will be down the wings, I expect. Hopefully they field Dan Burn and Kieran Trippier as I feel Romaine Mundle, Bertrand Traoré, Wilson Isidor, Brian Brobbey, Chemsdine Talbi, Eliezer Mayenda, Enzo Le Fée and whoever else can play up top can cause real problems for their defence, irrespective of who’s playing.\n\nEveryone will say Granit Xhaka and Noah Sadiki, but I think the importance is on the attack and their ability to beat their man in the final third.\n\nLike a lot of teams, Newcastle won’t “like it up ’em”, so an on-fire Granit Xhaka is essential.\n\nThat may be a go-to answer, so I’ll also give a shout out to Dan Ballard. Apart from his defensive duties alongside Omar Alderete, I think he’ll be able to cause them great concerns from corners  and free kicks.\n\nBallard had an unfortunate FA Cup game in 2023/2024 so he has even more to prove about his development and improvement since then. His surging runs out from the back are becoming more of a feature of his game, as well as his deft chips to set off an attack, so he’s well capable hurting them in defence and in attack.\n\nCan you imagine a scenario where he scores a late winner? “BALLARD!!”\n\nA derby game can be decided in a single moment, with any individual player stepping forward to make a difference.\n\nWe’ll need a collective effort in terms of performance from all our starters and finishers, but I think Robin Roefs will be just as important as the likes of Dan Ballard, Granit Xhaka and whoever else completes the spine of our side.\n\nRoefs has been in superb form all season and there’ll be difficult moments where we’ll need our Dutch stopper to come to the rescue.\n\nFrom his aerial dominance — which will be tested against the likes of Nick Woltemade — to his shot-stopping ability, I back Roefs to make a string of vital saves which could tip the balance in our favour.\n\nIt was a tough loss to take at Manchester City but after playing them and Liverpool in such a short period of time, it was a touch too much for our strong but still-developing squad.\n\nThat said, we’ve always bounced back from the odd defeat this season, and doing that this weekend will be oh so sweet.\n\nIn terms of players, we’re so much better now than we were in that FA Cup tie, so I’m confident we can take them on all over the park, to be honest.\n\nRobin Roefs is an amazing goalkeeper and will boss his box and distribute very well.\n\nTrai Hume and Dan Ballard will want revenge for the cup loss — especially Ballard after his unfortunate own goal. They’ve both improved massively since that 0-3 loss and surrounded by Nordi Mukiele and Omar Alderete, they’ll be a formidable force for Newcastle’s attack to try and breach. Nick Woltemade will be a handful but if we can negate Erling Haaland, we can handle him too.\n\nIt’s in the middle and up front that I think we have the main upper hand.\n\nWe have the experience, energy and technical prowess in Noah Sadiki, Granit Xhaka and Enzo Le Fée to hold our own against any side, and they showed that against Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool.\n\nUp front, we not have not only Wilson Isidor and Eliezer Mayenda to choose from, but also Brian Brobbey, whereas in the FA Cup, we were playing Nazariy Rusyn with Jobe as a false nine, while a forlorn Hemir sat on the bench.\n\nThe step up in quality since that game is within the realms of trading in a battered old mini for a shiny Ferrari. I do hope they’re all thinking the delta is as it was then, as they’ll get a massive surprise and will be run ragged.\n\nI agree with Anth that the wide men will be key and with Romaine Mundle fit, we have even more options to create out wide and to feed the front men. Both Bertrand Traoré and Chemsdine Talbi have had great run outs of late too, scoring and working very hard, and Mundle is building up his fitness but is already showing glimpses of his ability.\n\nIn short, we have talent everywhere and most of all, we’re a team of great lads with camaraderie, confidence and spirit, led by a tactical genius.\n\nThe Mags only managed to beat Burnley 2-1 at the weekend — with an extra man for over half of the game and through a very dubious penalty, and if they play Dan Burn and Joe Willock down the left, I honestly think any of the above lads will have a field day.\n\nTino Livramento isn’t a bad right back, but with Jacob Ramsey in front of him, that side can be attacked too.\n\nWhen we get closer to the weekend I’ll start getting nervy, but I’m more excited than worried right now. These are the games we wanted back on the list. It’s more than about league points — it’s about bragging rights after centuries of rivalry.",

I’m sure he didn’t mean to shoot the second one, but oh well, I’ll ask him,” he added with a smile.\n\nKounde actually admitted he was a “bit surprised” to see his second effort end up in the back of the net but also made it clear he was thrilled to score the goals that sealed an important victory.",

    "title": "Luke O’Nien: From League One Losses To His Premier League Debut",
    "description": "Despite having an up and down week or so, Luke O’Nien’s legacy at Sunderland is one that should give many budding footballers inspiration.",
    "fullText": "Look, even though he got stupidly sent off at the weekend, Luke O’Nien has fully cemented his legacy as one of the greatest Sunderland players. I’d even argue that he could receive straight red cards for the rest of his career and still not lose the love of so many supporters.\n\nLuke O’Nien’s Sunderland journey is almost a tale as old as time. Brought to Sunderland in 2018 ahead of the club’s first season in League One, he had quite a rocky start. But O’Nien thrived at Sunderland, winning the 2018/19 Sunderland Young Player of the Year, featured in the 2020/21 EFL League One Team of the Season, and starred in the promotion winning squad of 2021/22.\n\nO’Nien’s real legacy at the club comes from the unhinged antics he gets up to on the pitch. We simply can’t forget the double whammy of February and March 2023 with the piggyback from Bristol City’s Alex Scott and the cheeky kiss gifted to Norwich City’s Jacob Sorensen.\n\nLuke also cemented his status off the pitch through his support for the local community and honesty about his tough adventure in football. This connection with the fans meant that he was awarded ‘Club Captain’ in 2024/25.\n\nRegardless of his new title, the antics didn’t stop there. On 31st August 2024, he scored an own goal which single-headedly ended Sunderland’s 389 minute run without conceding. He tweeted: ‘No celebrations for my third goal of the season, but delighted to be the only man to score past Anthony Patterson this season’. Despite causing us pain, at least he made us laugh along the way.\n\nIn December 2024, O’Nien made club history by shattering the record for the most appearances held at the Stadium of Light.\n\nHe then proceeded to get back up to mischief in February, taking out the linesman and deciding to wave his flag. Luke played 47 times in the Premier League promotion winning season and, despite a nasty injury in the 2nd minute of the Playoff Final, he claims he ‘covered more distance celebrating’ than he did playing.\n\nFast forward to 2025/26 and it’s been a tough few months for Luke. After having brought Sunderland all the way from League One for the last 7 years, it’s been painful for fans to watch him not get any game time due to his injury. However, following him finally being put on the substitute bench against Manchester United in October, O’Nien posted a very emotional statement to his Instagram:\n\n‘From sitting on the floor in non-league to walking out at the Theatre of Dreams, all in just over a decade. I remember sitting on the grass at Wealdstone because the bench was full, waiting for my chance and hoping for a moment to prove myself. Last weekend, after a long layoff, I was sitting on the bench at Old Trafford in the Premier League. It’s funny how life comes full circle’.\n\nThen, at long last, in Gameweek 14’s midweek clash between Sunderland and current title holders Liverpool, away at Anfield, Luke O’Nien finally made his Premier League debut.\n\nHe was substituted on in the 91st minute for goalscorer Talbi and our emotions were laid bare. I won’t confirm nor deny whether I shed a tear or two when he was brought on.\n\nIn an emotional most-match interview, O’Nien told: ‘my wife said my kids were up [and] they were jumping up and down when I came on’. He continued with: ‘to come this far with this incredible club, with the fanbase, I think, for the first time in my Sunderland career, I’m lost for words’.\n\nSo thank you, Mr Sunderland, for staying with us through thick and thin. At least you haven’t been given two straight red cards yet.\n\nLuke’s full post-match Instagram caption can be read below:\n\n“For years, I’ve dreamed about playing in the Premier League. Some people laughed at me. Some coaches I had when I was little said I’d never make it. Lots of people told me I wasn’t good enough and to give up. But I’ve always held on to that dream of playing at the highest level. Deep down I believed that if I just kept working, kept learning, kept showing up every single day, then one day it might happen.\n\n“Last night, that dream that 4 year old me had… came true.\n\n“And if you’d told me I’d make my debut at left wing, up against my mate Mo Salah, I’d have laughed as well. From non-league in 2014, to being released by Watford in 2015… there were moments where it felt like this day might never come.\n\n“Sunderland, you’ve been my home for seven years. I never knew I could fall in love with a club, a city, and its people the way I have. You’ve given me space to grow, to fail, to learn, and to find out who I am as a player and a person. To play even a small part in rebuilding this beautiful club and helping it climb back to where it belongs is something I’ll always be proud of.\n\n“Making my Premier League debut… I’m incredibly grateful. Taking a moment afterwards to stand with my mum and dad and breathe it all in… that was special. But that debut chapter is written now. The focus is on pushing on, improving, growing, and helping drive this club forward with this unbelievable group of players.\n\n“Seven years ago we were in League One. Fast forward to last night and we have a team giving everything, disappointed to only get one point against the Premier League champions. If that’s not a moment to stop, reflect, and feel proud, I don’t know what is.\n\n“Thank you to everyone who’s been part of this journey; my family, my friends, the staff, the supporters, and my teammates.",

    "fullText": "Tigers re-sign Kyle Finnegan to a two-year $19 million contract originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAfter dominating for much of the season last year and eventually making the American League Division Series, all eyes have been on the Detroit Tigers this offseason. Would they be able to land a top free agent like Alex Bregman? Would they seriously consider trading Tarik Skubal? Thus far, Detroit hasn't made any moves with the exception of Gleyber Torres signing his qualifying offer.\n\nOn Tuesday night, the Tigers signed their first big free agent of the 2025 offseason, agreeing to bring back Kyle Finnegan on a two-year $19 million contract. The contract can max out at $20 million with incentives.\n\nDetroit acquired Finnegan from the Nationals last season and he impressed in 16 games with the Tigers. Across those games, Finnegan posted a 3-0 record with a 1.50 ERA and four saves. Over the last three seasons, Finnegan has recorded 90 saves.\n\nGiven the familiarity with Finnegan, the price point and the thinning market for relievers, this is a solid deal for Detroit. Just like last season, Finnegan will work in tandem with Will Vest out of the bullpen, another Detroit reliever with closing experience.\n\nNow, apart from Robert Suarez, Pete Fairbanks and Kenley Jansen, there are few closers left on the free agent market. That said, set-up relievers are still available, including Brad Keller, Luke Weaver, Seranthony Dominguez and Tyler Rogers to name a few.\n\nWhile this is a good start for the Tigers, you have to think that they'll need to add a bit more to keep pace with other American League contenders.\n\nFormer GM predicts the Yankees to land Freddy Peralta in a trade with the Brewers\n\nSeattle rumored to trade for Cardinals left-hander\n\nDetroit once again showing strong interest in free agent Alex Bregman",

    "fullText": "The Baltimore Orioles are making it clear they want to be players in this year's free agent market, and the latest report suggests they have their eyes on the biggest prize available.\n\nAccording to MLB Network insider Jon Morosi, the Orioles have spoken with Kyle Tucker's camp about a potential deal.\n\nMorosi reported the news alongside Jon Heyman on Bleacher Report, noting that Orioles president of baseball operations Mike Elias has a history with the four-time All-Star outfielder since Elias was the scouting director in Houston when the Astros drafted Tucker fifth overall in 2015.\n\nThe Orioles have spoken with Kyle Tucker’s camp, as I reported with @JonHeyman on @BleacherReport today. \n\nMike Elias drafted him in Houston. @MLBNetwork\n\n— Jon Morosi (@jonmorosi) December 9, 2025\n\nTucker is coming off a solid 2025 campaign with the Chicago Cubs where he posted a .266 batting average with 22 home runs, 73 RBI, and 25 stolen bases in 136 games.\n\nHis .841 OPS and 143 OPS+ still ranked among the best in the National League even though he dealt with a hairline fracture in his right hand during the summer.\n\nThe 5 best hitters still on the FA Market by wRC+ (2025): \n\n-Pete Alonso (141)\n-Kyle Tucker (136)\n-Bo Bichette: (134)\n-Jorge Polanco (132)\n-Ryan O'Hearn (126) pic.twitter.com/tRnUNbjIIX\n\n— Past The Eye Test Baseball (@PastTheEyeTest) December 9, 2025\n\nOver his eight-year career, the 28-year-old has hit .273 with 147 home runs and 490 RBI while earning four All-Star selections, a Gold Glove Award, and a World Series ring with the Astros in 2022.\n\nTucker is expected to command one of the largest contracts in baseball history with projections putting his deal somewhere in the range of 11 years and $400 million.\n\nThe Orioles are coming off a season they would rather forget. After making the playoffs in back-to-back years in 2023 and 2024, Baltimore finished 2025 with a 75-87 record and landed in last place in the AL East.\n\nThey fired manager Brandon Hyde in May when the team sat at 15-28 and were officially eliminated from postseason contention on September 16.\n\nRosenthal: Orioles, Marlins discussing Edward Cabrera trade.\n\nOther teams are also in contact with Marlins regarding Cabrera. pic.twitter.com/tgBTDQLjZE\n\n— Underdog MLB (@UnderdogMLB) December 10, 2025\n\nThe organization used 70 different players throughout the season and had 29 players spend time on the injured list, which contributed to their struggles.\n\nNow under new ownership with David Rubenstein at the helm, Baltimore is signaling they are ready to spend like a big-market team.\n\nThis is not the first splash the Orioles have tried to make this offseason. Reports indicate they offered Kyle Schwarber a five-year, $150 million deal that matched what he eventually signed with the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nBaltimore has also already traded for slugging outfielder Taylor Ward from the Angels and signed All-Star closer Ryan Helsley.\n\nMLB agent Scott Boras talked Tuesday about the Orioles' interest in former Mets slugger Pete Alonso, who is one of the most sought-after free agents on the market this offseason.\n\nHe also said that Orioles president of baseball operations Mike Elias has been in regular… pic.twitter.com/c15Ugu8L7R\n\n— The Baltimore Sun (@baltimoresun) December 9, 2025\n\nAdding Tucker would give the Orioles an elite left-handed bat to pair with Gunnar Henderson, Adley Rutschman, and the rest of their young core.\n\nHis swing would also play well at Camden Yards, where left-handed hitters have historically thrived. If Baltimore lands Tucker, they could then package young outfielders like Colton Cowser or Dylan Beavers in trades to address their pitching needs.\n\nThe Orioles still have work to do if they want to compete in an AL East that sent three teams to the postseason in 2025, but talking to Tucker's camp is a sign that Baltimore is serious about getting back to contention.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFor the first time in a long while, the Atlanta Braves will not be led by Brian Snitker at the manager position. However, new manager Walt Weiss will get Ronald Acuña Jr. fully healthy to start the season. Acuña struggled at times last year coming off an ACL injury, but he still managed to make history.\n\n“Ronald Acuña Jr. is the only player to debut in the Divisional Era (1969) to average 30+ HR and 30+ SB per 162 games played (min. 800 games played),” MLB posted.\n\nHe performed well enough to earn NL Comeback Player of the Year, which shows just how good he still is despite two ACL injuries.\n\n“Acuña, 27, tore his left ACL on May 26, 2024, and returned to the Braves this past May 23 and made his fifth All-Star team. He hit .290 with 21 home runs, 42 RBIs and 9 stolen bases,” ESPN wrote in November.\n\nThe Braves are thrilled to begin the season with Acuña healthy, especially as he enters the prime of his career. Weiss is also considering putting him back in the leadoff spot.\n\n“It’s enticing to have him at the top of the order,” Weiss said. “I really like when a lineup turns over and there’s teeth right away. If you’re a pitcher, you’ve got to run through a gauntlet as soon as the lineup turns over.”\n\nGiven Weiss’s comments, it would not be surprising to see the Braves open the season with Acuña leading off. And with Antoan Richardson serving as the baserunning coach, Acuña could find even more success on the basepaths.\n\nAcuña is ready for another MVP-caliber season, and the leadoff spot is an ideal place to get that rolling. Weiss will ultimately do what he believes is best, but his comments now may hint that this will be the final decision come March.",

    "title": "What we’re hearing on Red Sox at Winter Meetings Day 2: Pete Alonso meeting & more",
    "description": "Here's what we're hearing on the Red Sox as the Winter Meetings continue in Orlando.",
    "fullText": "ORLANDO, Fla. — As of Tuesday evening, the Red Sox were still trying to finalize plans to meet with free agent slugger Pete Alonso in person.\n\nAccording to an industry source, the Sox and Alonso have already met via Zoom prior to the start of the Winter Meetings. Not surprisingly, the Red Sox would like to meet in person, too as they ramp up their pursuit of the top power hitter remaining on the free agent market. Plans were complicated somewhat Tuesday by high-ranking front office members battling cold/flu symptoms and limiting in-person interactions throughout the day,\n\nAlonso lives in Tampa, about 75 miles west of Orlando, and could potentially return to the Winter Meetings Wednesday for an in-person meeting. He is known to be bouncing around the Waldorf Astoria Orlando for in-person meetings and the Orioles were reportedly on his list as well.\n\nIt’s likely that Alonso’s ask price increased Tuesday with the news that Kyle Schwarber agreed to a five-year deal with the Phillies. If Schwarber can command a five-year deal just a few months shy of 33, it’s likely that Alonso will be seeking either a six- or seven-year deal. It’s unknown if the Red Sox would be willing to commit to a contract that would pay Alonso to his age 36 or age 37 season.\n\nWhile agent Scott Boras said he expected Alonso’s market to pick up in the wake of the Schwarber deal, a source with knowledge of the bidding said his expectation is that Alonso’s market drags past this week.\n\nIn addition to exploring some free agent solutions, the Red Sox continue to discuss some trade possibilities with several clubs.\n\nOn Monday, MassLive reported talks with the Arizona Diamondbacks centered around second baseman Ketel Marte, while also reporting that the Sox were known to be engaged with three or four other teams.\n\nOne of those potential deals, it’s now known, is with the Houston Astros for corner infielder Isaac Paredes, as The Athletic’s Ken Rosenthal reported Tuesday morning.\n\nParedes can play either first or third and would give the Red Sox a productive right-handed bat. He’ll turn 27 in February and would come with two years of control remaining.\n\nBut Paredes doesn’t have the same power profile as some of the other names being pursued by the Red Sox. He’s only hit more than 20 homers once – a career-high 31 in 2023 while with Tampa Bay.\n\nThe Astros are in the market for young, controllable pitching and have targeted either Payton Tolle or Connelly Early for their desired return. At least one member of the Red Sox organization Tuesday suggested that was too high an asking price. The Red Sox are getting hits on other controllable pitchers like Hunter Dobbins and Kutter Crawford, though, and those arms might interest teams like Houston.\n\nThe Red Sox are certainly open to adding two bats, though the chance of two high-priced free agent additions seems low.\n\nPart of the motivation for finding a taker for infielder Vaughn Grissom Tuesday was to clear a spot on the team’s 40-man roster to enable them to potentially make a selection in Wednesday’s Rule 5 draft.\n\nTrading Grissom leaves the Red Sox with an open spot; they’re currently at 39.\n\nIn recent years, the Red Sox have been fairly active in the Rule 5, landing Garrett Whitlock in the 2020 draft and fellow reliever Justin Slaten in the 2023 draft.\n\nBoth times, however, the Red Sox were in rebuilding mode with no real expectations to contend, making it somewhat easier to utilize a season-long active roster spot for an untested player.\n\nNow that the Red Sox, a playoff team last October, have designs on competing for a pennant, do they still have the ability to take a gamble on a Rule 5 choice?\n\n“We’re still working through what our approach will be tomorrow —collecting information, identifying areas of the roster that could benefit from the available player pool,“ said chief baseball officer Craig Breslow. ”But I’m not sure it’s necessarily true that it’s been informative of a competitive level or competitive window.\n\n“You can look at the success of some our recent Rule 5 picks and say that those guys were able to contribute on a championship-caliber team. We need to find the right fit. We need to make sure that we’re not going to hamstring ourselves because 2026 is really important season for us in terms of wins.”\n\nIn any case, Grissom had fallen out of favor with the Red Sox and was too low on their depth chart to continue holding a 40-man roster spot.\n\nIn his media availability with reporters, manager Alex Cora may have provided a hint as to how a divisional rival might use a new free agent signee.\n\nLefty Steven Matz, who reportedly agreed to a two-year, $15 million contract with the Rays late Monday, might return to starting despite making 51 of his 53 appearances as a reliever in 2025. During Matz’s two-month stint with the Sox after a trade deadline deal, Matz made it clear to Cora he felt like his days in a rotation aren’t over.\n\n“I talked to him throughout September and October,” Cora said. “He felt like he wanted to be a starter again, and no doubt about it, he’ll be fine. Strike-throwing machine, workaholic, good guy. They’ve got a good one.”\n\nRelief market a possibility for Sox\n\nDon’t discount the possibility of the Red Sox adding a veteran reliever or two via free agency. While adding power is clearly a priority at this point — and pitching additions are on the back-burner — there remains the possibility of Boston adding someone as a bridge to Garrett Whitlock and Aroldis Chapman.\n\nOne name the Red Sox have checked in on? Seranthony Dominguez, though nothing is hot there as of Tuesday night.\n\nRed Sox landed the perfect pitcher last winter; Finding the perfect hitter is proving considerably harder | Sean McAdam\n\nRed Sox trade rumors: Boston exploring deal for Rangers All-Star (report)\n\nRed Sox have new challenge for Wilyer Abreu in ‘26: ‘He has earned the right,’ says Craig Breslow\n\nMany key Red Sox will play in World Baseball Classic; what about Aroldis Chapman for Great Britain?\n\nAs Boston Red Sox pursue Alex Bregman, Alex Cora explains ‘less is more’",

    "fullText": "Paul Pogba has moved into the sport of camel racing after investing in Saudi Arabia-based team Al Haboob.\n\nThe Monaco midfielder has become a shareholder and ambassador for Al Haboob - the world's first professional camel racing team competing across the United Arab Emirates and the Gulf.\n\nPogba, 32, told BBC Sport: \"I've watched my fair share of [camel] races on YouTube and spent time doing research in my spare time trying to understand the techniques and strategies.\n\n\"And what stood out to me is how much dedication it takes from everyone involved. At the end of the day, sport is sport. It demands heart, sacrifice and teamwork.\"\n\nCamel racing is a traditional sport which is particularly popular in the Middle East.\n\nPogba set to make first appearance since doping ban\n\nWhy Monaco have gambled on 'wildcard' Pogba\n\n\"People might not realise it, but sport always connects in some way,\" added Frenchman Pogba.\n\n\"Whether it's football, camel racing, boxing - the foundations are similar. You need determination, you need focus, you need discipline and grit. That's what makes champions at the end of the day.\"\n\nPogba, who became the world's most expensive player when he joined Manchester United from Juventus in 2016 for £89m, added: \"Being the world's most expensive footballer was an honour, but it also came with a lot of hard work, pressure and responsibility.\n\n\"Owning the world's most expensive camel one day would be a beautiful full-circle moment - something fun, something meaningful and something that excites me. Maybe one day we make it happen.\"\n\nAl Haboob, founded by entrepreneurs Omar Almaeena and Safwan Modir, is the world's first modern camel racing team to compete internationally.\n\n\"Paul's involvement is transformational,\" said Almaeena.\n\n\"His influence, leadership, and passion for cultural storytelling reflect exactly what Al Haboob stands for. This partnership is about more than racing; it is about sharing a heritage that deserves global recognition.\"\n\nPogba made his long-awaited return to professional football on 22 November after coming on as a late substitute in Monaco's 4-1 Ligue 1 defeat by Rennes.\n\nThe 2018 World Cup winner had not played since featuring for Juventus against Empoli in September 2023, following an original four-year doping ban, that was cut to 18 months by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas).\n\nPogba maintained it was a mistake and he was given a supplement without knowing it contained a banned substance.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Italy’s failure to qualify automatically for the 2026 World Cup inevitably sparked plenty of debate across this once-proud footballing nation.\n\nLosing home and away to Norway consigned Italy to the play-offs and left them facing the prospect of missing out on the tournament for the third consecutive time.\n\nHead coach Gennaro Gattuso inevitably resorted to deflection tactics towards the end of European qualifying, bemoaning the revised system that seemingly favors other continents.\n\n“In my day, the best group runners-up went straight to the World Cup, now the rules have changed,” Gattuso said.\n\n“Italy’s record of six wins? You’d have to ask the people who make the groups and the rules. In 1990 and 1994, there were two African teams, now there are nine. It’s not a controversy, but there are difficulties, and we know it well.\n\n“If we look at South America, where six out of 10 teams go directly to the World Cup and the seventh heads into a play-off with a team from Oceania, that does give you regrets and a certain sadness. That is the disappointment. The system needs to change in Europe.”\n\nPutting aside the fact there are some factual inaccuracies in Gattuso’s comments, the 2020 European champions have only themselves to blame for their current situation.\n\nItaly were the top seeds in a relatively easy group, yet failed to get the job done. However, you flower it up, losing to Norway by a combined 7-1 scoreline is unacceptable.\n\nThe decision to appoint Gattuso to replace Luciano Spalletti looked questionable when it was announced, and subsequent events have done little to dispel that notion.\n\nGattuso was a fine player – a combative midfielder who helped AC Milan win the Champions League twice and Italy lift their last World Cup trophy in 2006.\n\nHowever, his managerial record at club level was hugely underwhelming and Italy’s decision to place him in charge may yet have a catastrophic ending.\n\n“When I heard Gattuso was online it just seemed to demonstrate the giant collapse of Italy,” Italian football journalist Mina Rzouki told the Euro Leagues podcast.\n\n“There were so many clips going around on social media about that Italy team just before they won the World Cup and you are talking about Paolo Maldini, [Fabio] Cannavaro, [Alessandro] Nesta, [Francesco] Totti, [Alessandro] Del Piero and it was just an embarrassment of riches.\n\n“Now when you look at Italy over the last few seasons, even though they won the Euros, there was just a fall – but the one thing you could rely on was that Italy created these great coaches. Yet none of these great coaches were called up or have succeeded.”\n\nPlay-off draw offers Italy hope\n\nItaly’s hopes of progressing to the World Cup were boosted after they were handed a relatively favorable draw in the play-offs.\n\nThey will host Northern Ireland in the semi-final, with the winners of that game visiting either Wales or Bosnia & Herzegovina in the final.\n\nThe last four tie against Northern Ireland should hold little fear for Italy. They suffered defeats at Germany and Slovakia in the group stage and generally don’t travel too well.\n\nHaving won seven and drawn three of their previous 11 meetings, Italy have little to fear from a team ranked 69th in the latest FIFA rankings.\n\nOn paper, Wales are the biggest threat to Italy. They are ranked 32nd in the world and are generally tough to beat on their own patch.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that they have never defeated Bosnia & Herzegovina in four previous attempts. The visitors will fancy their chances of enhancing that record.\n\nUltimately, given that Italy are currently ranked 12th in the world, they should be able to successfully navigate through the play-offs.\n\nThey have lost just twice to Wales in ten previous meetings and once to Bosnia & Herzegovina in six matches. If Italy fail to progress, they have no excuses.\n\nWhile suggesting that Italy could mount a challenge for the World Cup next summer is a little fanciful, stranger things have happened in football.\n\nThey demonstrated their credentials by winning the 2020 European Championship title and can draw inspiration from what they achieved on that occasion.\n\nAside from Spain and France, none of the other so-called main contenders for the World Cup are significantly better than Italy.\n\nIf they safely navigate the play-offs and land a favorable draw next summer, Italy are perfectly capable of making a deep run in the tournament.",

    "fullText": "ORLANDO, Fla. — The Red Sox don’t anticipate ace Garrett Crochet or star rookie Roman Anthony participating in the World Baseball Classic in the spring. Regardless, Boston will be well-represented in the tournament.\n\nIn addition to reliever Garrett Whitlock, who will pitch for Team USA, there are many other Boston players expected to participate, according to manager Alex Cora and chief baseball officer Craig Breslow. Outfielders Jarren Duran (Mexico) is committed and Ceddanne Rafaela (Netherlands) and Wilyer Abreu (Venezuela) appear likely to join him. Reliever Jovani Morán will pitch for Puerto Rico. There are plenty of players in the “maybe” category, too, including Marcelo Mayer (Mexico), Aroldis Chapman (Great Britain) and Brayan Bello (Dominican Republic)\n\nCatcher Carlos Narváez (Venezuela) and designated hitter Masataka Yoshida (Japan) are unlikely to suit up in the tournament considering the injuries they dealt with in 2025.\n\nCora, who played twice for Puerto Rico and served as the island’s general manager in 2017, said the Red Sox encourage all their players to participate if it makes sense for them to do so. The tournament, which will be played from March 5-17, will pull players out of spring training.\n\n“I love the tournament,” Cora said. “There’s some injury factor, and stuff happens. But it can happen in Houston. It can happen in Miami and Puerto Rico. It can happen in Fort Myers. But they have to play baseball.”\n\nCora said Crochet decided not to represent Team USA because his of his 2025 workload, which surpassed 200 innings. Narváez had offseason knee surgery and will be re-assessed in camp. Whitlock, Duran, Rafaela and Abreu all ended the season healthy and should be able to participate with no restrictions. Situations involving other players are more complicated.\n\nOne such case is Mayer, who after missing the last two months of the season with a wrist injury, will be looking to compete for a starting infield spot in camp. He has expressed his interest in suiting up for Mexico but is not yet committed because he’s recovering from surgery.\n\n“There’s certain rules within the tournament as far as injured players and insurance and surgeries and all that. So we’ll see where we’re at,” Cora said. “I know when we went to Monterrey, when he left Monterrey, he was like, ‘I want to play in the tournament.’ So we’ll see where we’re at. They’re kind of, like, 50/50, Mexico, understanding that he had surgery and there’s other stuff that comes up with the whole thing.\n\n“It’s complicated, to be honest with you. But if he gets cleared, from our standpoint, if he wants to do it, we’re OK with it.”\n\nBello, who pitched a career-high 166 ⅔ innings in the regular season, wants to pitch for the Dominican Republic but the team will be careful with his build-up to the season.\n\n“He’s potentially a candidate but also there will be conversations there,” Breslow said. “The last couple years, he has come into spring training a little bit behind so that’s something who we want to make sure we’re sensitive to.”\n\nChapman, who re-signed with the Red Sox in September toward the end of an All-Star first season in Boston, is leaning toward pitching for Great Britain, though his paperwork has not yet been finalized, in part because it has been hard to access records from the Cuban government. Chapman is eligible to pitch for Great Britain because of his Jamaican heritage, which makes him eligible for British citizenship and therefore, participation in the tournament.\n\nRed Sox landed the perfect pitcher last winter; Finding the perfect hitter is proving considerably harder | Sean McAdam\n\nRed Sox trade rumors: Boston exploring deal for Rangers All-Star (report)\n\nWhat we’re hearing on Red Sox at Winter Meetings Day 2: Pete Alonso meeting & more\n\nRed Sox have new challenge for Wilyer Abreu in ‘26: ‘He has earned the right,’ says Craig Breslow\n\nAs Boston Red Sox pursue Alex Bregman, Alex Cora explains ‘less is more’",

    "description": "The Red Sox have gone out of their way to limit Wilyer Abreu's exposure to left-handed pitching so far in his career. Assuming he's not traded, expect that to change in 2026.",
    "fullText": "ORLANDO, Fla. — In his first two major league seasons, Wilyer Abreu has been a platoon player. The Red Sox have made sure to limit his exposure to left-handed pitchers in an effort to maximize their lineup every day.\n\nAssuming Abreu isn’t traded before Opening Day, expect that to change in 2026. The Red Sox want to have a two-time Gold Glove right fielder in their lineup every day, and to do so, plan to challenge Abreu to face lefties in the batter’s box.\n\n“With Willy and some of the lefties, we have to see if they can do it,” said manager Alex Cora. “It’s about that time, especially with Abreu. If he can hit lefties and hit for power and play defense the way he’s done the last few years, he can be the guy.”\n\nSince debuting late in the 2023 season, Abreu has gotten just 15 starts against left-handed starters — and 145 total plate appearances. In those chances, he has struggled to a .205 average and .589 OPS, numbers markedly lower than his output against righties (.265 average, .827 OPS). In 2025, the Red Sox played 45 regular season games — and two \n\nSince Cora took over as manager in 2018, the Red Sox have slow-played their young left-handed hitters when it comes to like-handed matchups. Rafael Devers, Triston Casas, Abreu and Marcelo Mayer all come to mind. Others, like Casas and Mayer, might still get limited chances come Opening Day, but it sounds like the Red Sox are ready to take the training wheels off when it comes to the 26-year-old Abreu.\n\n“Wilyer is a really good player,” said chief baseball officer Craig Breslow. “We’ve seen the way he’s able to impact both sides of the ball. He has earned the right to get some added runway against left-handed pitching. We feel like it’s an adjustment he’s capable of making. He’s got such a solid defensive floor that having him out there more often than not is going to help the overall team.”\n\nIn recent years, the Red Sox were willing to play the matchup game on a daily basis because they had lefty-mashing platoon players like Rob Refsnyder and Romy Gonzalez on the roster. Refsnyder, though, is a free agent, and as MassLive reported Monday, has a strong market that includes other American League contenders and could lead to him receiving a two-year deal.\n\nIf Refsnyder departs, at-bats will be available, especially with southpaws on the mound. Abreu will likely get some of them with utility players Kristian Campbell and Nate Eaton serving as other candidates for increased playing time. It was notable Tuesday that Cora went out of his way to praise Eaton, potentially setting the table for him to take over as a Refsnyder replacement.\n\n“Nate, last year, the way he played in September, that was eye-opening,” said Cora. “The athlete. Actually, the at-bats were really good. So we’ve got some intriguing guys that can step up, very athletic guys that can help us.”\n\nRed Sox landed the perfect pitcher last winter; Finding the perfect hitter is proving considerably harder | Sean McAdam\n\nRed Sox trade rumors: Boston exploring deal for Rangers All-Star (report)\n\nWhat we’re hearing on Red Sox at Winter Meetings Day 2: Pete Alonso meeting & more\n\nMany key Red Sox will play in World Baseball Classic; what about Aroldis Chapman for Great Britain?\n\nAs Boston Red Sox pursue Alex Bregman, Alex Cora explains ‘less is more’",

    "description": "There's no perfect deal to make for a hitter. But the Red Sox have to do something.",
    "fullText": "ORLANDO, Fla. — It was almost exactly a year ago Wednesday, the final day of the 2024 Winter Meetings, that the Red Sox acquired Garrett Crochet in exchange for four prospects from the Chicago White Sox.\n\nIn almost every measurable way, it turned out to be the perfect trade for the Red Sox. Crochet soon signed a six-year extension to give the team additional control of him, making the player cost more tenable. Then, Crochet went out and pitched like the ace the Red Sox projected he could be, leading the league in strikeouts and innings pitched while finishing second in wins and third in ERA.\n\nIt was, from the benefit of 12 months later, the perfect offseason move. The Red Sox got precisely what they needed to head their rotation and locked him up for the foreseeable future.\n\nBut this winter has served as a reminder of how rare those kinds of transactions are.\n\nThe Red Sox are in search of at least one and possibly two hitters to improve a lineup that, while in the top third of the game in terms of runs scored, was otherwise perfectly ordinary when it came to power. They finished right smack dab in the middle in home runs and managed just one in three playoff games.\n\nTo date, they’ve come up empty, which doesn’t mean there aren’t still options available, even with the news that Kyle Schwarber is staying put in Philadelphia. There’s still time and still choices available.\n\nBut none is going to fit the club the way Crochet did a year ago, something Craig Breslow tacitly acknowledged Tuesday.\n\n“Everybody goes into the offseason with their ideal outcomes,” said Breslow, “and you quickly realize that that’s the most unlikely path. There is a sliding scale but our offensive profile lacks a little bit of thump and that’s where we’ve set our sights.\n\n“But there are other ways to improve the team. There will be other ways to improve the team. But I think we’re going to exhaust that type of power profile first before we look at alternatives.”\n\nSchwarber, good as he is — second in homers to only Shohei Ohtani over the last four years and able to hit lefties as well as righties — was a DH only, bringing next to no defensive value. And he’ll be 33 before next season begins.\n\nSort through the other possibilities for the Red Sox and they’re similarly flawed in one way or another.\n\n∗ Trade target Ketel Marte is signed for another five years at a cost of more than $100 million dollars and comes with some questions about his level of commitment after missing the first three games of the Arizona Diamondbacks first three games after the All-Star break.\n\n∗ Free agent Pete Alonso is regarded as a poor first baseman and is a slow baserunner. At 31, those deficiencies are only going to get worse.\n\n∗ Free agent Bo Bichette is a limited defender who, though he has very good bat-to-ball skills, doesn’t really profile as a power hitter. He’s never hit as many as 30 homers in a single season and, in fact, has hit more than 24 just once.\n\n∗ Trade target Isaac Paredes is versatile — able to play both first and third — but is at best average at both spots. His career OPS of .766 is somewhat underwhelming.\n\n∗ Free agent Alex Bregman, while a solid fit for both Boston and the Red Sox, isn’t so dynamic that he alone can lift the team’s offensive profile. They had him in the lineup last year and that wasn’t nearly good enough.\n\nThe list goes on and on, with every potential acquisition sporting a concerning weakness or negative.\n\nThen there’s the acquisition costs — nine-figure free agent contracts or, in the case of trade candidates, sacrificing some of the team’s precious young pitching.\n\nAnd that’s if a trade can be made\n\n“I think that, maybe more so than in past years, teams are really content to hold their really good players,” said Breslow. “In a lot of the conversations that we’ve had, a number of teams have conveyed that they’re very comfortable holding their players. As are we. So that does add a layer of difficulty in making these things work.”\n\nUltimately, though, none of that matters. The Red Sox can’t afford to let perfect be the enemy of good. Just because each of their upgrade options are flawed in one way or another doesn’t mean they should try to get by with what they have.\n\nThe Sox are at a crossroads. They’re good enough to be a playoff contender but not good enough to win a World Series. To reach that level, they need to be bold — bold enough to add two bats.\n\nAnd if the players aren’t as perfect on the hitting side as Crochet was on the pitching side, they’re just going to have to live with that.\n\nRed Sox trade rumors: Boston exploring deal for Rangers All-Star (report)\n\nWhat we’re hearing on Red Sox at Winter Meetings Day 2: Pete Alonso meeting & more\n\nRed Sox have new challenge for Wilyer Abreu in ‘26: ‘He has earned the right,’ says Craig Breslow\n\nMany key Red Sox will play in World Baseball Classic; what about Aroldis Chapman for Great Britain?\n\nAs Boston Red Sox pursue Alex Bregman, Alex Cora explains ‘less is more’",

Yet Andrey Santos was an unused sub.\n\nAlso, when Wesley Fofana got injured, instead of putting Josh Acheampong at centre back and using one of the two other right backs he had on the pitch, he took Fofana off and put Tosin Adarabioyo on, who has been awful in recent games.\n\nEven still, Maresca has defended his decisions and the subs he made, even doubling down on them in his post-match interview. Madness.\n\nJoe Cole was unhappy with the defeat in his post-match analysis for TNT Sports and once again highlighted the lack of experience being a big issue at this club, which is genuinely is and has been for years.\n\nAs things currently stand, Chelsea are 11th in the league stage of the UCL but could slip further down the table depending on results elsewhere today.\n\n16 points could be enough for a top eight finish to automatically qualify for the last 16, so Chelsea must beat Pafos and Napoli to have any chance of this.\n\nIf they do not get automatic qualification they will face playing two extra games in the playoffs to try and get there, and no club wants an extra games right now.\n\nThey will also have David Luiz and Antonio Conte stood in our way! Luiz currently plays for Pafos, and Conte is the Napoli manager! Yikes.",

    "fullText": "Is Victor Wembanyama playing tonight vs. Lakers? FInal status for Spurs star originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs will look to keep their dreams of winning the NBA Cup alive when they travel to Los Angeles to take on the Lakers in a cup quarterfinal game on Wednesday night. Unfortunately, the Spurs won’t have the services of star center Victor Wembanyama in the game.\n\nWembanyama has been sidelined since he suffered a left calf strain against the Golden State Warriors on Nov. 14. He’s missed 11 straight games for the Spurs, and he’s still not ready to return to game action quite yet.\n\nThe former No. 1 pick has been officially ruled out of the game against the Lakers as he continues to recover from the calf strain.\n\nThe good news for Spurs fans is that Wembanyama recently returned to practice as a full participant, so a return should be on the horizon. Following their game against L.A., the Spurs have a full week off from games. That extended stretch of rest could be beneficial for Wembanyama, who could potentially return when the Spurs host the Washington Wizards on Dec. 17.\n\nWhile the Spurs would obviously like to have Wemby available for what projects to be a challenging matchup with the Lakers, they’ve been able to hold it down without him. They’ve gone 8-3 in the 11 games that he missed and they currently sit fifth in the Western Conference standings with a record of 16-7.\n\nBefore he went down with the calf injury, Wembanyama was playing the best ball of his young career. In 12 appearances on the season, he’s averaging 26.2 points, 12.9 rebounds, 4.0 assists, 3.6 blocks and 1.1 steals per game. He was also the heavy favorite to win Defensive Player of the Year. His ability to win that award is now in jeopardy due to the 65-game minimum threshold that was established by the NBA a couple of years back.\n\nThe cup contest on Wednesday night will be the second meeting of the season between San Antonio and L.A. The Lakers pulled out a 118-116 victory over the Spurs in early November. Wembanyama played in that game and had 19 points, 8 rebounds and 3 assists in 33 minutes.",

With the Reds coasting to a 2-0 win, the 26-year-old jumped in on Willy Gnonto recklessly and gave away a penalty.\n\nLeeds duly scored and picked up their momentum - eventually earning a 3-3 Premier League draw.\n\nKonate’s drop in standards could not have come at a worse time for the player - with contract negotiations with sporting director Richard Hughes reportedly ongoing.\n\nThe France international is out of contract in 2026 - and would in theory be seeking a massive pay rise from his current wage of around £140k per week.\n\nShop the goalkeeper range today\n\nShop the third kit range today!\n\nHe will be available to speak to potentially interested clubs in a matter of weeks - and Liverpool could be left with an awkward decision to make.\n\nRight now he isn’t showing the form of a player worth a long-term contract of £200k per week or over. And so if he rejects Liverpool’s attempts to tie him down on the club’s terms then he could be considered for sale in January.\n\nLiverpool could then put the proceeds towards a replacement centre-back - either Marc Guehi or Nico Schlotterbeck.\n\nDefensa Central is now reporting that Real Madrid are set to commit a massive transfer U-turn over Konate - and a bid of €15m in the winter window is being prepared.\n\nMadrid have fallen apart under Xabi Alonso in recent weeks - and defensive totem Eder Militao is now expected to miss several months of action owing to an injury suffered over the weekend.\n\nLos Blancos therefore are ready to reverse their decision NOT to chase Konate - who they’d previously been chasing on a free transfer for summer 2026.\n\nThis could represent the ideal opportunity for Liverpool to get an underperforming high-earner off the books and rake in some money they’d miss out on if he left for free.\n\nOnce again the decision will come down to the sporting director - who really needs to put the defensive department right having missed out on Guehi last summer.",

    "fullText": "Mohamed Salah’s Liverpool future has been a source of intense speculation following his explosive interview.\n\nThe 33-year-old accused the club of throwing him under the bus and said his relationship with manager Arne Slot has collapsed.\n\nSlot dropped Salah from the squad for Tuesday’s Champions League game against Inter Milan, which the Reds won 1-0 following Dominik Szoboszlai’s late penalty goal.\n\nLiverpool still want to keep the Egyptian star at Anfield, but that scenario is looking unlikely at the moment.\n\nThe Gulf News report that Saudi Arabia is prepared to do ‘whatever it can’ to bring Salah to the Middle East in the winter transfer window.\n\nSaudi authorities are closely monitoring the player’s situation and seeking a move either on loan or through a permanent transfer.\n\nThere is competition within the Pro League to sign the experienced forward.\n\nThe Public Investment Fund (PIF) affiliated club Al-Hilal are keen on him, while Al Qadsiah (linked to state-owned energy giant Aramco) have also been credited with an interest.\n\nSalah has been integral to Liverpool’s recent success. He has bagged 250 goals and 116 assists in 420 senior appearances, helping his team win two Premier League titles and a Champions League.\n\nThe Egypt international scored 34 goals in 52 games last season, helping the Merseyside giants lift the Premier League trophy.\n\nBut he hasn’t been his usual self this campaign, netting just four times in 13 league appearances.",

I think everyone just saw how [emotional] I looked. It will sink in in a few days' time. I will let all the excitement settle down first.\"\n\nHedman had lost in three finals before arriving for her 15th tournament at Lakeside in November.\n\nRietbergen took the first set, but Hedman bounced back to secure victory, finally securing the title that had long eluded her.\n\n\"When [the dart] went in I just thought, 'Thank God, finally I've done it',\" she told Ian Puckey on BBC Essex Sport Extra.\n\n\"Most people saw I started blubbering like a child. It was just the relief.\n\n\"I didn't think it was ever going to come.\"\n\nIt topped off a remarkable year for the arrow expert, who was born in Jamaica but moved to England aged 13.\n\nHedman found out in June that she would be appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for her services to darts and charity.\n\n\"I can't put into words right now how I feel,\" she added.\n\nThe world champion stressed she was \"grateful and privileged\" to still be at the oche doing what she loved.\n\n\"Things are written, and if it's meant to be, it's meant to be.

    "fullText": "Australia captain Pat Cummins will return for what could be a decisive third Ashes Test against England in Adelaide next week.\n\nThe fast bowler missed the first two Tests - which Australia won - because of a back problem.\n\nHis addition is the only change to the Australia squad following the eight-wicket win in Brisbane.\n\nAustralia need only a draw in Adelaide to retain the Ashes, while victory will mean they win the five-Test series.\n\nEngland have never come from 2-0 down to win the Ashes.\n\nThe third Test starts on 17 December (23:30 GMT, 16 December).\n\nCummins has not played since July, but trained with the rest of the squad around the first two Tests.\n\nThere was a suggestion he may have played in the second Test, and he took part in a public selection meeting the day before the game, only for Steve Smith to remain in temporary charge.\n\n\"He looks like he's moving really well,\" said Australia wicketkeeper Alex Carey. \"He's been around the group the whole time with lots of energy.\"\n\nThe rest of the Australia squad is as expected, with pace bowler Josh Hazlewood absent for the rest of the series because of hamstring and Achilles problems.\n\nFast bowler Jhye Richardson will also train with Australia in Adelaide as he continues to recover from a shoulder injury, with a view to possibly playing later in the series.\n\nOff-spinner Nathan Lyon missed out on the team in Brisbane and is expected to return in Adelaide. If Lyon is included along with Cummins, it could mean seamers Brendan Doggett and Michael Neser are left out.\n\nAustralia have another decision to make over Usman Khawaja. The left-hander was unable to open in the first Test because of a back problem, which then caused him to miss the second Test.\n\nTravis Head and Jake Weatherald have formed an impressive opening partnership in his absence. Khawaja could therefore be competing with Josh Inglis for a place in the middle order.\n\nWhile Australia's players have returned home between Tests, the England squad have taken a break in the beach town of Noosa. They will return to training on Sunday.\n\nIn order to get back into the series, England must end a 17-Test winless run in Australia when they take the field at the Adelaide Oval.\n\nAlthough Australia have won the previous three Ashes series in this country, they squandered a 2-0 lead in England in 2023 to draw 2-2.\n\n\"The way we've started the series has been good,\" said Carey. \"To come to Adelaide 2-0 is a good position to be in, but we understand the series is definitely not over.\n\n\"You can get into trouble if you start looking at the end of the series in Sydney already.\n\n\"We know England are a very good cricket team and we know we were in a position like this in England, then we weren't able to win that series.\n\n\"We're excited for the opportunity we've got, but also understand we have to keep playing good cricket.\"\n\nAshes history offers little statistical hope for England - Zaltzman\n\nEngland need to win next Test or Ashes will get embarrassing - McGrath\n\nEngland fast bowler Wood out of Ashes tour",

    "fullText": "Ben Foster has poured praise on Manchester United summer signing Matheus Cunha.\n\nThe former goalkeeper’s comments came just before United’s win over Wolverhampton Wanderers on Monday night, which saw Cunha oversee a tremendous display on his first return to Molineux following his exit in June.\n\n(Photo by Alex Livesey/Getty Images)\n\nWhile the Brazilian was unable to get on the scoresheet, he recorded his first assist for United when selflessly setting up skipper Bruno Fernandes, when he very easily could’ve netted the opener – and his second goal – when one-on-one with Sam Johnstone.\n\nYet, it was Cunha’s performance against West Ham that had Foster completely wowed by what he’d seen.\n\n“Cunha is a player, by the way,” said Foster on his show, the Fozcast.\n\n“Honestly, I went to West Ham the other night. Honestly, he is unreal, by the way. He just looks like he’s getting even better.”\n\nRuben Amorim will certainly be intrigued by the latter claim, as he’ll need the 26-year-old to really step up to the mark in Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo’s absences when the African Cup of Nations gets underway later this month.\n\n(Photo by Justin Setterfield/Getty Images)\n\nIt’s expected Benjamin Sesko will be back at the coach’s disposal by the time United’s internationals depart, but Cunha, who boasts three-and-a-half seasons worth of Premier League experience over the young Slovenian, will likely occupy the main focal point of United’s attack.\n\nThat being said, Sesko has scored once more than his senior counterpart in one less appearance.\n\nNext up for the Reds is a visit from an out-of-form Bournemouth side in yet another Monday evening slot next week, followed by a trip to Villa Park on Sunday, December 21.\n\nBen Foster says Amorim has a player in his ranks who’s just ‘unreal’, and he’s ‘getting even better’\n\nConfirmed: Amorim will have to make do without ‘special’ star for crunch festive fixtures after new development\n\nAgent: £66m attacker will play for Man United ‘sooner than expected’ in huge boost to Amorim",

    "description": "Drama early and late gave Nashville the 4-3 victory.",
    "fullText": "One last stop on a four-game road trip, the Colorado Avalanche were hoping to end the jaunt on a high note but that didn’t come to fruition as they lost in a shootout to the Nashville Predators by a score of 4-3. This one was a doozy with high drama in both the opening and closing minutes with a real lull in the middle.\n\nCale Makar scored his elusive power play goal to send the game into overtime with eight seconds remaining. Ryan O’Reilly netted the lone shootout marker to give Nashville the win.\n\nIt was an eventful start to say the least with four goals scored at the net front in the opening 10 minutes of the game. Brock Nelson took advantage of some lackadaisical defending to put the visitors up by one just a minute into the contest. Jonathan Marchessault gathered his own rebound off of the returning Scott Wedgewood to quickly tie the game for Nashville three minutes later. Ninety seconds after that Nelson gave one back with some poor coverage on Reid Schaefer. Finally, Artturi Lehkonen worked his magic at the net front to get the Avalanche back to an even score at 2-2 by the halfway mark. And that’s how the first period would end after the flurry of goals concluded.\n\nThe second period was a stark contrast as no goals were scored. Colorado received three power plays, just about all in a row at the end of the period but couldn’t convert so the game remained tied 2-2 after 40 minutes of play.\n\nAction started to heat up again in the third period when Brady Skjei fired a low shot which went post-and-in just over the halfway point of the period. From there Nashville tried to shut the door, which almost worked until they took a penalty with under two minutes remaining. With the extra attacker the Avalanche flirted around the perimeter but a Cale Makar shot from the blue line finally found it’s way to the back of the net got his first power play goal of the season and sent the game into overtime with the score tied 3-3.\n\nNashville held a slight advantage in shots 5-4 in the extra frame as the play went back-and forth. The real drama ensued when the shootout began, however.\n\nRyan O’Reilly went first in the skills competition and put a tally on the board for Nashville. Martin Nečas missed his shot and then Filip Forsberg missed as well. But in the process Forsberg ran right over Scott Wedgewood who seemed a little stunned by the hard contact. Then Val Nichushkin’s shot was saved by Juuse Saros, Steven Stamkos missed his shot as well so it was up to Gabe Landeskog to give it one last shot for Colorado. Right before beginning his turn the officials notified the Avalanche bench that Wedgewood was being pulled by the concussion spotters and Mackenzie Blackwood was summoned to take his place in the Avalanche net. Landeskog then missed his shot and the game was over 4-3 in favor of Nashville.\n\nThe stars shone bright in this contest and nearly burned out. Cale Makar played over 30 minutes in this game Nathan MacKinnon over 28 minutes himself. Six forwards didn’t even get to the 13 minute mark. If you can’t trust your depth to beat the worst team in the league at the end of a long road trip do you truly have depth?\n\nIt’s curious as to why Gavin Brindley was taken off injured reserve but didn’t play in this contest. Yes, Martin Nečas was a game-time decision with illness and then eventually suited up but it shouldn’t take someone unable to play to get Brindley back in action. Zakhar Bardakov played five minutes in this game. If Brindley is really a key part of this lineup then why didn’t he play?\n\nWith his assist on the Lehkonen goal, Nathan MacKinnon became the first player in the NHL to score 50 points this season in his 900th career NHL game. MacKinnon was also first to the milestone last season as well. Congrats, Nate!\n\nA meeting at Ball Arena with the defending Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers is on tap. The game will be nationally televised on ESPN at 7:30 p.m. on Thursday, December 11th.",

    "fullText": "Enzo Maresca is still dividing opinion at Chelsea. Despite a Club World Cup win and a top 4 finish last year, as well as an overall bright start to this campaign, there are a lot of doubters about the Italian coach.\n\nChelsea icon Gianfranco Zola speaking on the pitch at Stamford Bridge.\n\nOne person who isn’t in any doubt about him is club legend Gianfranco Zola. He claims he saw the coach’s talent before he had even come to Stamford Bridge.\n\n“I didn’t know him personally before he came to Chelsea, but I had followed what he did at Leicester and could see that we were dealing with a serious coach,” Zola said.\n\n“He’s worked with and for [Arrigo] Sacchi, Manuel Pellegrini, [Pep] Guardiola. He’s had an excellent grounding.”\n\nThere are a lot of positives about Maresca which nobody can dispute – he seems to have a lot of respect from the players and as Zola says, he’s got a great background in terms of people he’s worked under.\n\nHowever many Blues fans still aren’t delighted with the football he has his teams playing, and there are other gripes about his rotation policy and team selection in general. There’s also a sense he doesn’t get the best out of our star player, Cole Palmer.\n\nIt will be very interesting to see how feelings change through the course of the coach’s second year in charge.\n\nChelsea’s social media silence over one player this week was very notable – it doesn’t look like things are getting sorted out in this case anytime soon.\n\nChelsea managed to get a player into the Premier League team of the week in the week just gone – but it’s not the sort of player you want to see in there.

    "description": "Even visitors from countries like Britain and France, whose citizens don’t need visas, would have to share five years’ worth of social media.",
    "fullText": "Travelers visiting the United States from countries like Britain, France, Germany and South Korea could soon have to undergo a review of up to five years of their social media history, according to a proposal filed on Tuesday by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nThe change would affect visitors eligible for the visa waiver program, which allows people from 42 countries to travel to the United States for up to 90 days without a visa as long as they first obtain electronic travel authorization.\n\nIn a document filed on Tuesday in the Federal Register, C.B.P. said it plans to ask applicants for a long list of personal data including social media, email addresses from the last decade, and the names, birth dates, places of residence and birthplaces of parents, spouses, siblings and children.\n\nUnder the current system, applicants from visa waiver countries must enroll in the Electronic System for Travel Authorization program. They pay $40 and submit an email address, home address, phone number and emergency contact information. The authorization is good for two years.\n\nThis move from C.B.P. follows similar actions by the U.S. government to conduct social media reviews for some visa applicants, including seekers of the H-1B visas awarded to skilled foreign workers, as well as applicants for student and scholar visas. It also follows the government’s pending plans to collect a new $250 visa integrity fee from many visitors, though visitors from visa waiver countries are exempt from that fee.\n\nThe travel industry has pushed back on the visa integrity fee. In November, a coalition of more than 20 tourism and travel businesses signed a letter of opposition, citing concerns that the fee would discourage millions of prospective international visitors to the United States, including those traveling to events like next year’s World Cup.\n\nA travel industry official who spoke anonymously because his organization had not yet had time to review the proposal said C.B.P. did not brief industry stakeholders on the plan, which he called a significant escalation in traveler vetting.\n\nIn the notice, C.B.P. said it would accept 60 days of public comments on the proposal.\n\nIf the plan is approved, C.B.P. could enact the changes gradually over the following weeks and months, the immigration law firm Fragomen said in an alert. Bo Cooper, a partner at Fragomen, called the government’s new approach to social media screening a “paradigm shift” from when agencies used social media to verify specific facts, such as criminal activity.\n\n“The new method involves looking at online speech, and then denying travel based on discretion and policy about the kinds of things that get said,” Mr. Cooper said, adding, “It’ll be interesting to watch the tourism numbers.”\n\nThe firm warned that the government’s increase in data collection could result in longer waits for travelers to get authorization to visit the United States, in addition to “an increased likelihood of being flagged for closer scrutiny.”\n\nSophia Cope, a senior staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, said in a statement that the mandatory social media disclosure and surveillance would “exacerbate civil liberties harms.”\n\n“It has not proven effective at finding terrorists and other bad guys,” she added. “But it has chilled the free speech and invaded the privacy of innocent travelers, along with that of their American family, friends and colleagues.”\n\nC.B.P. did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nFollow New York Times Travel on Instagram and Dreaming up a future getaway or just armchair traveling?

    "description": "Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis show that psychedelic compounds such as psilocybin appear to distort the link between blood flow and brain-cell functioning, which scientists use to track brain activity.",
    "fullText": "Psilocybin is a psychedelic drug with promising clinical applications for treating mood disorders and substance abuse disorders. Recent work in functional MRI (fMRI) studies show that psychedelics can reset brain network activity — and it is thought that this effect, which can linger for days, might explain its therapeutic benefits.\n\nPsychedelics such as psilocybin act on a chemical in the brain called serotonin that controls the relaxation and contraction of blood vessels. Because fMRI uses changes in blood flow and blood oxygen levels in the brain as a proxy for brain activity, a team of WashU Medicine researchers set out to determine if these signals remained an accurate measure of brain activity in subjects dosed with a similar psychedelic that acts on the same chemicals.\n\nThey observed, in mice given this drug, that blood flow did not change as it normally would in relation to the activity of brain cells called neurons. When combined with a second medication that blocks a specific receptor in the brain that responds to serotonin, the blood flow effects from the psychedelic drug were removed.\n\nThe team’s subsequent studies using psilocybin in mice produced similar results to those observed with the first drug. Reanalyzing results from an earlier fMRI study in human subjects given psilocybin revealed similar effects on brain responses.\n\nThese results have important implications for how researchers interpret fMRI scans of brain activity in people who have taken psychedelics, and they may aid the scientific search for how psychedelics achieve their potential therapeutic effects.\n\nThe research was led by Adam Q. Bauer, an associate professor at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis’ Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology; Jordan G. McCall, an associate professor of anesthesiology in the Center for Clinical Pharmacology; and Joshua S. Siegel, MD, PhD, who conducted the work at WashU Medicine and is now an assistant professor at New York University. The study was published in Nature Neuroscience.\n\nTogether, the results from mice and humans indicate that the neurovascular effects of psychedelics need to be better understood when interpreting blood flow-dependent neuroimaging. As compounds like psilocybin are increasingly studied for treating conditions including post-traumatic stress disorder, treatment-resistant depression, substance abuse and stroke, understanding how psychedelics affect the reliability of brain scans as a proxy for brain activity is important for clinicians and researchers examining the effects of these drugs.",

    "description": "We’re on a journey to advance and democratize artificial intelligence through open source and open science.",
    "fullText": "We gave Claude the ability to fine-tune language models using a new tool called Hugging Face Skills. Not just write training scripts, but to actually submit jobs to cloud GPUs, monitor progress, and push finished models to the Hugging Face Hub. This tutorial shows you how it works and how to use it yourself.\n\nClaude Code can use \"skills\"—packaged instructions, scripts, and domain knowledge—to accomplish specialized tasks. The hf-llm-trainer skill teaches Claude everything it needs to know about training: which GPU to pick for your model size, how to configure Hub authentication, when to use LoRA versus full fine-tuning, and how to handle the dozens of other decisions that go into a successful training run.\n\nWith this skill, you can tell Claude things like:\n\nThe model trains on Hugging Face GPUs while you do other things. When it's done, your fine-tuned model appears on the Hub, ready to use.\n\nThis isn't a toy demo. The skill supports the same training methods used in production: supervised fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. You can train models from 0.5B to 70B parameters, convert them to GGUF for local deployment, and run multi-stage pipelines that combine different techniques.\n\nHugging Face skills are compatible with Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini CLI. With integrations on the way for Cursor, Windsurf, and Continue.\n\nThis repo includes gemini-extension.json to integrate with the Gemini CLI.\n\nYou have to authenticate to your Hugging Face account with a write-access token so that the job can create a model repo.\n\nConfigure Hugging Face MCP Server to use your write token by sending it in either the HF_TOKEN or Authorization: Bearer HTTP Headers.\n\nFor Claude Code : claude mcp add --transport http hf-skills https://huggingface.co/mcp?bouquet=skills --header \"Authorization: Bearer $HF_TOKEN\"\n\nLet's walk through a complete example. We'll fine-tune a small model to see the full workflow, then explore more advanced capabilities.\n\nStart with a simple and clear instruction to fine tune a specific model\n\nThe coding agent analyzes your request and prepares a training configuration. For a 0.6B model on a demo dataset, it selects t4-small—enough GPU for this model size and the cheapest option available.\n\nThe open-r1/codeforces-cots dataset is a dataset of codeforces problems and solutions. It is a good dataset for instruction tuning a model to solve hard coding problems.\n\nBefore your coding agent submits anything, you'll see the configuration:\n\nThis is your chance to adjust anything. Change the output repo name, pick different hardware, or ask Claude to modify training parameters. Once you approve, the agent submits the job.\n\nFor example, you can ask the agent to try a test run:\n\nAfter submission, you get job details:\n\nThe skill includes Trackio integration, so you can watch training loss decrease in real-time. Jobs run asynchronously so you can close your terminal and come back later. When you want an update:\n\nThen the agent fetches the logs and summarizes progress.\n\nClick here for an example Trackio dashboard with some completed runs.\n\nWhen training completes, your model is on the Hub:\n\nThat's the full loop. You described what you wanted in plain English, and the agent handled GPU selection, script generation, job submission, authentication, and persistence. The whole thing cost about thirty cents.\n\nThe skill supports three training approaches. Understanding when to use each one helps you get better results.\n\nSFT is where most projects start. You provide demonstration data—examples of inputs and desired outputs—and training adjusts the model to match those patterns.\n\nUse SFT when you have high-quality examples of the behavior you want. Customer support conversations, code generation pairs, domain-specific Q&A—anything where you can show the model what good looks like.\n\nThe agent validates the dataset, selects hardware (a10g-large with LoRA for a 7B model), and configures training with checkpoints and monitoring.\n\nFor models larger than 3B parameters, the agent automatically uses LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) to reduce memory requirements. This makes training 7B or 13B models feasible on single GPUs while preserving most of the quality of full fine-tuning.\n\nDPO trains on preference pairs—responses where one is \"chosen\" and another is \"rejected.\" This aligns model outputs with human preferences, typically after an initial SFT stage.\n\nUse DPO when you have preference annotations from human labelers or automated comparisons. DPO optimizes directly for the preferred response without needing a separate reward model.\n\nDPO is sensitive to dataset format. It requires columns named exactly chosen and rejected, or a prompt column with the input. The agent validates this first and shows you how to map columns if your dataset uses different names.\n\nGRPO is a reinforcement learning task that is proven to be effective on verifiable tasks like solving math problems, writing code, or any task with a programmatic success criterion.\n\nThe model generates responses, receives rewards based on correctness, and learns from the outcomes. This is more complex than SFT or DPO, but the configuration is similar.\n\nThe agent selects hardware based on your model size, but understanding the tradeoffs helps you make better decisions.\n\nFor tiny models under 1B parameters, t4-small works well. These models train quickly—expect $1-2 for a full run. This is perfect for educational or experimental runs.\n\nFor small models (1-3B), step up to t4-medium or a10g-small. Training takes a few hours and costs $5-15.\n\nFor medium models (3-7B), you need a10g-large or a100-large with LoRA. Full fine-tuning doesn't fit, but LoRA makes these very trainable. Budget $15-40 for production.\n\nFor large models (7B+), this HF skills job is not suitable.\n\nWhen testing a workflow, start small:\n\nTh coding agent configures minimal training—enough to verify your pipeline works without real cost.\n\nAlways run a demo before committing to a multi-hour production job. A $0.50 demo that catches a format error saves a $30 failed run.\n\nDataset format is the most common source of training failures. The agent can validate datasets before you spend GPU time.\n\nThe agent runs a quick inspection on CPU (fractions of a penny) and reports:\n\nIf your dataset needs transformation, the agent can show you how:\n\nThe agent provides mapping code and can incorporate it directly into your training script.\n\nReal-time monitoring helps you catch problems early. The skill configures Trackio by default—after submitting a job, you can watch metrics at:\n\nThis shows training loss, learning rate, and validation metrics. A healthy run shows steadily decreasing loss.\n\nAsk the agent about status anytime:\n\nIf something goes wrong, the agent helps diagnose. Out of memory? the agent suggests reducing batch size or upgrading hardware. Dataset error? The agent identifies the mismatch. Timeout? The agent recommends longer duration or faster training settings.\n\nAfter training, you might want to run your model locally. The GGUF format works with llama.cpp and dependent tools like LM Studio, Ollama, etc.\n\nThe agent submits a conversion job that merges LoRA adapters, converts to GGUF, applies quantization, and pushes to Hub.\n\nWe've shown that coding agents like Claude Code, Codex, or Gemini CLI can handle the full lifecycle of model fine-tuning: validating data, selecting hardware, generating scripts, submitting jobs, monitoring progress, and converting outputs. This turns what used to be a specialized skill into something you can do through conversation.\n\nThe skill is open source. You can extend it, customize it for your workflows, or use it as a starting point for other training scenarios.\n\nIs this still usable without a Pro account? Will it be able to output everything up to \"Submit the job to Hugging Face Jobs\"?\n\nIs there data privacy when doing this?\n\nIs it posted privately to a personal/team hub?\n\nCould this be done locally without the push to the repo?\n\nAnother agentic way of wasting tokens\n\nis it possible to use this inside vscode's copilot extension ?\n\nSkill documentation is not available at the provided link - https://github.com/huggingface/skills/blob/main/hf-llm-trainer/SKILL.md\n\nAh, we moved a couple of bits around in the repo -- link for that is here: https://github.com/huggingface/skills/blob/main/hf-llm-trainer/skills/model-trainer/SKILL.md -- I'll update the article 👍.\n\n\"Really fascinating read! I found the explanation of Hugging Face’s “Skills Training” initiative — how it lets you use a coding‑agent (like Claude Code or other supported agents) to fine‑tune large language models, submit GPU jobs, monitor progress and push trained models to the Hub — particularly eye‑opening. The combination of high‑level instructions, hardware selection, monitoring, and automation makes the complex process of model training much more approachable, even for developers who may not be ML‑infrastructure experts.\n\nI also recently read a related guide: https://mobisoftinfotech.com/resources/blog/ai‑development/llm‑api‑pricing‑guide\n — which gives practical advice on LLM API usage, token‑based pricing, and how to plan costs when working with LLMs.\n\nPutting your article’s look into empowering accessible LLM fine‑tuning together with the cost‑management strategies from that guide gives a well‑rounded perspective: it helps developers understand not just what is possible now with modern tools, but also how to build and deploy responsibly, balancing capability and cost.\"\n\nGreat work and great article!\nRegarding the maximum models size we can train using this approach, at the beginning of the article it's mentioned \"models from 0.5B to 70B parameters\" but at the end you write that \"For large models (7B+), this HF skills job is not suitable\", which order of magnitude is correct?\nI suspect the max range is 7B, if it's the case, do you plan to support training of larger models?\nThanks!\n\nis the trained model now open source and / or available to the public?\n\n·\n Sign up or\n log in to comment",

    "description": "Here's the \"boring\" path to riches that doesn't involve starting a business, investing in real estate or inheriting the money.",
    "fullText": "You may be surprised to find out that about 18% of Americans are millionaires, translating to roughly 25 million individuals, according to a report by Wealth Management USA. And while there are plenty of ways to accumulate a seven-digit net worth, some avenues are more common than others.\n\nFind Out: 6 Money Moves Wealthy People Always Make Before New Year’s\n\nFor You: 6 Subtly Genius Moves All Wealthy People Make With Their Money\n\nMany millionaires start their own business or invest in real estate to earn their riches, while others imply inherit the money. But the number one way that Americans become millionaires is actually within reach of average workers, provided they start early and stick to their plan.\n\nHere’s the “boring” path to riches that doesn’t involve starting a business, investing in real estate or inheriting the money.\n\nWant the “easy” way to a million dollars? Continually investing regularly is the best way to build wealth.\n\nAccording to a report from Morningstar, investors who have $1 million or \n\nTrending Now: Here’s the Minimum Net Worth Considered To Be Upper Class in Your 70s\n\nThere are several reasons why consistent investing is the “easy” path to $1 million. First, regularly adding money to your investments regardless of the market environment ensures that you’ll get an average price. You’ll be buying more stock when prices are low and less when prices are high. You won’t be putting all your money in either at the absolute bottom or at the peak, but since the long-term trend of the market is up, getting that “average” price provides a significant return.\n\nSecond, by consistently investing in “boring” options like mutual funds, 401(k) funds or high-quality stocks, you won’t be taking on excess risk. With automated contributions coming out of your paycheck or bank account, you won’t get tempted to chase the latest investment fad, a mistake that costs many novice investors their entire bankroll. As preservation of capital is half the battle when it comes to building wealth, automatically contributing to relatively “boring” investments can help protect your bankroll over the long run.\n\nThe third reason why consistent investing works is a simple one. If you continually add money to your account, you’ll have more money in it. If you simply invest $30,000 and watch it grow, you may end up with $60,000, $120,000 or even $240,000 in your account, depending on how long you keep it invested. But if you regularly add $1,000 per month to your account for 40 years, you’ll have contributed $480,000. A simple double of your money over time would be nearly enough to reach that $1 million level.",

    "fullText": "Polish authorities have reported a case involving a truck stopped on the S3 expressway in western Lubuskie province, reported TVP World.\n\nThe routine check revealed over 22 tons of material that did not match the accompanying transport documents. This raised serious concerns about compliance, accountability, and traceability in cross-border shipments, as well as potential risks to public health and local communities, highlighting ongoing challenges in cross-border waste monitoring.\n\nThe driver, en route to the Silesia region, held documents allowing the transport of secondhand clothing. However, environmental protection officers found a wider mix of items, reporting \"discrepancies between the documents and the actual state of affairs.\"\n\nThe cargo included used clothing, electrical appliances, shoes, underwear, blankets, toys, and cosmetics. Classified as \"mixed waste,\" the shipment required a special import permit, which the driver did not have.\n\nHe was interrogated and fined 1,770 euros (about $2,055 USD), and the goods were seized for further investigation. The incident illustrates broader environmental concerns.\n\nWhile secondhand textiles are commonly imported and legally traded in Europe, improperly labeled or illegally imported waste can end up in facilities unequipped to handle it or be dumped or burned illegally, creating health and ecological hazards.\n\nCases like this serve as reminders that environmental protection depends on enforcement and responsible practices. Supporting policies that improve waste tracking, ensure proper recycling, and strengthen import regulations can help prevent harmful shipments from reaching communities.\n\nEvery decision, from border inspections to everyday consumer choices, contributes to a safer and cleaner environment.\n\nCommenters praised the authorities for intercepting the shipment, with one remarking, \"they wanted to dump it into our water.\" Others expressed relief that swift action prevented potential environmental damage.\n\nDo you recycle your old electronics?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "The US Food and Drug Administration is looking into whether deaths “across multiple age groups” have been related to Covid-19 vaccines, a spokesperson said Tuesday, weeks after a senior agency official claimed — without offering evidence – that Covid-19 vaccinations resulted in the deaths of 10 children.\n\nAndrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services, said the FDA is conducting “a thorough investigation” but declined to offer details on what data sources are being used and what potential changes, if any, are being considered to Covid vaccine approval or marketing.\n\nDr. Vinay Prasad, the FDA’s chief medical and scientific officer and director of its Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, claimed in a memo late last month that “Healthy young children who faced tremendously low risk of death were coerced, at the behest of the Biden administration, via school and work mandates, to receive a vaccine that could result in death.”\n\nPrasad did not provide details about the 10 deaths or how the FDA came to that conclusion but pointed to “an initial analysis” that examined 96 deaths and linked 10 to the Covid-19 vaccination. He also claimed that Covid “was never highly lethal for children” and that the effects of it “are comparable” to respiratory viruses for which there aren’t annual vaccines.\n\nMore than 700 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been administered in the US since they became available in late 2020, according to the World Health Organization. The shots have been extensively tested and continually monitored for safety, and serious side effects such as anaphylaxis or myocarditis have been generally rare.\n\nFDA regulations require health care providers to report deaths after vaccination to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), even if it’s not clear that vaccination was the cause of death. Members of the general public can also submit events to the database, which federal agencies use to generate further study on vaccine safety.\n\nPrasad said that as a result of the FDA analysis, the agency will adopt a new approval process for vaccines that will require more evidence of their safety and value before they can be marketed. Among the changes would be stricter requirements for authorization of vaccines used for pregnant women and trials for pneumonia vaccines that will need to prove the shots reduce disease, instead of showing that the vaccine produces enough antibodies to fight the illness.\n\nThe agency will also “revise the annual flu vaccine framework,” Prasad said, and “will re-appraise safety and be honest in vaccine labels.”\n\nHHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has repeatedly raised doubts about the effectiveness of vaccines and previously founded the anti-vaccine group Children’s Health Defense.\n\nAs secretary, Kennedy has slashed funding for mRNA vaccine development, replaced the members of the vaccine advisory committee at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and directed the CDC to change its website to include false claims that link autism and vaccines.\n\nCNN’s Kaanita Iyer, Adam Cancryn and Amanda Sealy contributed to this report.",

    "description": "The USS Arizona was one of the most historically significant warships in military history. The Navy just removed 150 tons of concrete from its remains.",
    "fullText": "After over 80 years in the water, the U.S. Navy has removed more than 150 tons of aging concrete mooring platforms from the USS Arizona. This move comes as the Navy and the Pearl Harbor National Memorial finish their months-long effort to protect and preserve the major U.S. Navy ship sunk during World War II. After years of planning, a team started this project in September 2025, taking the last of the two platforms from the water about a month later. Removing these concrete platforms was effectively the final step. Today, only small sections remain to avoid disturbing one of the most historically significant warships in military history.\n\nThe process involved using a crane barge and diamond wire saw to cut and lift concrete segments from the sunken battleship. Navy Mobile Diving and Salvage Unit 1 led the work alongside help from federal contractors. This was no small feat, as the team's schedule often involved many 12-to-14-hour days to get the job done on schedule.\n\nWhy now? Well, officials said the project addressed some long-standing concerns that the massive structures might eventually collapse through the USS Arizona's deteriorating decks. The concrete platforms were first installed after the attack at Pearl Harbor to support the salvage of guns and munitions. There they've remained ever since.\n\nSince it was an underwater job, several environmentalists were involved in the uninstallation process. Experts in marine resources, historic preservation, water quality, and water safety were on standby for continuous support. That way, the platforms could be removed without harming the surrounding harbor ecosystem, the memorial, or any of the people working to remove them in the first place.\n\nThe USS Arizona Memorial, managed by the National Park Service since 1980, spans the midsection of the sunken battleship and is accessible only by boat. Built in 1962, it serves as both a national monument and the final resting place for those hundreds of sailors and Marines who died aboard the ship — not to mention any survivors who later chose to have their ashes interred there. This major undertaking helps make sure the memorial is no longer under threat of damage, allowing future generations to still visit the U.S. battleship for years to come.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

While many saw it as a message to the West on international sanctions, the country has taken targeted steps to open its economy to the world’s largest cryptocurrency.\n\nDuring an investment conference in Moscow on Dec. 4, 2024, Putin argued that the influence of the dollar on the global economy was waning, paving the way for the growth of other instruments.\n\n“For instance – Bitcoin. Who can prohibit its use? No one,” Putin said. “Or the use of other electronic ways of settlement. No one can ban the use of them.”\n\nPutin added that the new instruments would “continue developing” regardless of what happens to the dollar.\n\nDon’t Miss: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nShortly after these comments, Russia’s Finance Minister Anton Siluanov revealed that Russian companies have started using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for cross-border transactions, described as a response to trade disruptions from sanctions imposed after the Ukraine war.\n\nThe minister said that it was possible to use the Bitcoin mined in Russia in foreign trade.\n\nIt’s worth noting that Putin greenlighted Bitcoin mining in the country earlier that year. He previously rejected the central bank's proposal to ban cryptocurrencies in 2022, arguing that the country possesses \"competitive advantages\" in the field of mining.\n\nIn accordance with Putin’s directives, the central bank proposed in March of this year to allow a limited number of “highly qualified” Russian investors to purchase and sell cryptocurrencies under a new three-year experimental legal regime.\n\nThe bank maintained that it still doesn’t see cryptocurrency as a means of payment and proposed a ban on all cryptocurrency transactions between Russian residents outside the experimental regime.\n\nSee Also: Fast Company Calls It a ‘Groundbreaking Step for the Creator Economy' — Investors Can Still Get In at $0.85/Share\n\nHowever, recent developments suggest attempts to expand cryptocurrency access for Russians. Bank of Russia First Deputy Governor Vladimir Chistyukhin said that rules should be eased beyond the “extremely narrow” category of qualified investors, given the sanctions in place, according to a Cryptopolitan report.",

    "description": "The latest JOLTS report shows hiring stuck at 3.2% and quits falling again as the Fed prepares to cut rates.",
    "fullText": "Mark Zandi is worried that the labor market no longer has a buffer.\n\nSo many Americans are “already living on the financial edge,” the chief economist for Moody’s Analytics told Fortune. If they start to pull back, that’s “fodder for a recession.”\n\nThe stark assessment comes as hiring has stalled, unemployment is rising—especially for the most vulnerable workers—and layoff announcements are piling up. To Zandi, the next stage is already visible: “If we actually do see layoffs pick up,” he told Fortune, “then it certainly would be a jobs recession.”\n\nZandi reached that assessment before the government released its long-delayed JOLTS report Tuesday, but the official numbers largely confirm the pullback he has been tracking through private data. Since the summer, job openings have risen by only a few hundred thousand and remain far below the highs seen in the frenzy of the pandemic. Layoffs upticked slightly, while quit rates fell, a sign that workers are increasingly hesitant to leave their current positions. Hiring, meanwhile, has held at 3.2%, a level consistent with employers who are not actively slashing staff but are no longer expanding their workforces either: a “low hire, low fire” market.\n\nIf the cooling in the official data looks slow, the private indicators tell a sharper story. ADP’s November report found that private employers cut 32,000 jobs, the steepest decline in more than two years. Nearly all of those losses came from small businesses, which eliminated 120,000 positions. Larger employers moved in the opposite direction and kept hiring.\n\nFor Zandi, the pattern is not random. He sees it as the continuation of a break that appeared earlier in the year, when the administration escalated reciprocal tariffs.\n\n“If you look at when job growth really came to a standstill, it is back soon after Liberation Day,” he said.\n\nBecause these firms often lack the financial cushions that larger corporations can draw upon, payroll becomes the most immediate and often the only mechanism through which they can respond to rising input costs. The result, Zandi argues, is a labor market in which the earliest fractures appear among precisely the kinds of employers most sensitive to policy and price shifts. Those fractures then begin to ripple outward, first through hiring freezes and only later, if conditions worsen, through broader layoffs.\n\nSo for Zandi, if ADP offers a snapshot of the present, the data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas hints at what may lie ahead. Employers have announced 1.1 million layoffs this year, a figure surpassed only during the pandemic shock of 2020 and the depths of the Great Recession.

    "fullText": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday that her country intends to send more water to the United States, but not immediately, even as U.S. President Donald Trump threatens to raise tariffs by 5% on Mexican imports if more water is not delivered as part of a water-sharing agreement.\n\nSheinbaum said Mexico is proposing a water delivery this month and another one in the coming years. The proposal will be discussed in a virtual meeting with U.S. officials Tuesday, she said.\n\nMexico is behind water deliveries to the United States from the Rio Grande River because of drought and pipeline limitations, Sheinbaum said.\n\nUnder a 1944 treaty, Mexico must deliver 1.7 million acre-feet of water to the U.S. from six tributaries every five years, or an average of 350,000 acre-feet every year. An acre-foot is the amount of water needed to cover 1 acre of land to a depth of 1 foot.\n\nTrump posted on social media Monday that Mexico has a water debt that has accumulated over five years and that is affecting farmers in Texas. He said that he has authorized a 5% increase on tariffs on Mexico if the water is not immediately released.\n\n“The U.S needs Mexico to release 200,000 acre-feet of water before December 31st, and the rest must come soon after,” Trump wrote. “As of now, Mexico is not responding, and it is very unfair to our U.S. Farmers who deserve this much needed water.”\n\nTrump first threatened tariffs over the water issue in April when he also threatened to impose 5% tariffs on Mexican imports and accused the country of continuing to violate the agreement.\n\nThe two countries have reached agreements on the issue in the past and the Mexican president said she hoped they would again find an understanding.\n\n“We have the best intention to deliver the amount of water that is owed from previous years,” Sheinbaum said.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",

    "fullText": "You know car culture has run amok when a parent is scolded for having their daughter walking … on the sidewalk. Yet, a Redditor shared a frustrating experience of just that with an anti-car subreddit.\n\n\"I was walking with my daughter on a sidewalk in the neighborhood,\" the user explained. \"She was about 5 ft behind me - we were playing with walkie talkies.\"\n\nDisrupting this wholesome fun was a man who said he was a former police officer. He offered his unsolicited two cents that the daughter was walking too far behind and could be accidentally hit by truck drivers during the holiday season. His rationale for that was unclear.\n\nThe OP didn't respond to the officer but expressed frustration over the encounter, considering he himself was in a large truck and \"he was part of the problem.\" Additionally, they added that moving to an area with good walkability and low car traffic was an intentional decision. They later noted the incident was at 6 a.m. on a barely-trafficked road.\n\n\"Yet, this truck man stopped to explain to me that I am wrong,\" the OP concluded. \"This makes me wish I didn't live in the US.\"\n\nThis unsettling story highlights real concerns about the country's priorities when it comes to walkability and pedestrian safety. There is ample evidence domestically and overseas that walkable cities are effective in reducing air and noise pollution while enhancing the richness of a place.\n\nFrustratingly, there are far too many places where cars are given the upper hand, leading to an overwhelming number of vehicles on the road. Even when this isn't the case, if the cars are increasingly monstrous trucks, they can both inconvenience or endanger pedestrians due to their huge size and poor visibility.\n\nThere are positive examples of communities exploring solutions like improving public transportation and enhancing pedestrian-friendly infrastructure. Still, the attitude the man showed toward the parent unfortunately remains in many drivers and lawmakers.\n\nCommenters empathized, with many expressing outrage at the retired cop's attitude.\n\n\"Sounds like he was projecting his intrusive thoughts of running over your kid,\" a user suggested.\n\nA commenter was baffled: \"They're in trucks because of the holidays. What the f*** does that even mean?\"\n\"GET THAT KID INTO A GIANT TRUCK, THERE ARE DANGEROUS GIANT TRUCKS OUT HERE,\" a Redditor joked.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump is touring swing states to defend his tariffs and sell the message that the economy is booming.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is standing by his tariffs, at least in theory.\n\nUnder the banner \"Lower Prices, Bigger Paychecks,\" Trump kicked off the first of a series of speeches to promote his economic message in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, as polls indicate the country is increasingly concerned about the rising cost of living.\n\n\"They always have a hoax,\" Trump told the crowd, referring to criticism from Democrats that his policies drove up prices. \"The new word is 'affordability.'\"\n\n\"Democrats are like, 'prices are too high.' Yeah, they're too high because they cause them to be too high,\" Trump added. \"But now they're coming down.\"\n\nLater, he said, \"I can't say affordability is a hoax because I agree the prices were too high. So I can't go to call it a hoax because they'll misconstrue that.\"\n\nTrump, during the 90-minute speech, also reiterated that his favorite word is \"tariff\" and credited his policies for bringing in \"hundreds of billions of dollars,\" presumably for the government in tariff revenue.\n\n\"You can give up certain products,\" Trump said at one point. \"You could give up pencils. Because under the China policy, you know, every child can get 37 pencils. They only need one or two, you know. They don't need that many.\"\n\nDespite standing by his tariff policies, Trump has, in reality, rolled back many of his earlier tariffs, especially ones enacted on April 2.\n\nTariffs are still higher than they have been in many decades, but the original 25% tariff on every import from Mexico and Canada was walked back to exclude all items covered in the USMCA trade agreement, which includes most imports from the two neighbors. Tariffs on imports from China, once more than 100%, have been reduced to a baseline tariff of 10%, which applies to all other countries.\n\nOn top of that, in an attempt to address the price of groceries, Trump also modified and removed tariffs on a range of food products in November, such as beef, coffee, bananas, and tomatoes.\n\nOf the remaining tariffs, evidence points to an impact on the price of consumer goods.\n\n\"Our analysis suggests that tariff measures are already exerting measurable upward pressure on consumer prices,\" according to a report published in October by the Federal Reserve of St. Louis that looked at data from January to August of this year. \"The rise in prices beginning in early 2025 coincides closely with tariff developments, and our model-based regressions confirm that these effects are statistically and economically significant.\"\n\n\"At the same time, the pass-through remains partial; only a portion of the model-predicted effect has materialized so far,\" the report added. \"This could reflect delays in price adjustments, competitive pressure limiting firms' ability to raise prices, or expectations that the tariffs may prove temporary.\"\n\nTrump's speech comes as consumer sentiment remains low. According to the University of Michigan's survey of consumers, sentiment dropped to 51 points in November, which is the second-lowest score the index has ever recorded since 1952, narrowly topped by a score of 50 in June 2022.\n\nEarlier on Monday, in an interview with Politico, Trump said that he would give his economy a grade of \"A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.\"\n\nSome Democrats have centered their pre-2026 midterm messaging on affordability, and several have explicitly blamed rising costs on Trump's tariff and trade policies. Zohran Mamdani, the New York City mayor-elect, with whom Trump had a meeting, also won while running primarily on making the city more affordable.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

Its more recent investments include prediction markets company Kalshi, and the legal tech startup Harvey.\n\nGrady, who has been with the firm for nearly 19 years, explained that before a startup gets a yes or no, everyone on the team votes on a scale of one to 10. A score above six is considered \"positive,\" and a score of four or below is considered \"negative.\"\n\n\"If everybody's a six, probably shouldn't make the investment. It's consensus, but nobody has conviction,\" he said. \"If three people are nines and three people are one, we should probably make the investment because the presence of the nines is a much more powerful signal than the presence of the ones.\"\n\nLin, who has been with the firm since 2010, said they follow this strategy because the firm is in the business of risk-taking.\n\n\"We need that volatility because the truth is not somewhere in the middle where everybody agrees,\" he said.\n\nThe partners said that they train their junior investors, who are historically \"A+\" students, to build a risk appetite.\n\n\"A lot of the people that join our team haven't had much failure, and we have to help them get comfortable with it because otherwise we're not going to get the outlier wins,\" Grady said.",

    "fullText": "Ground drones are growing more popular on Ukraine's front lines, but they're still vastly overshadowed by the small aerial drones made famous in the war.\n\nIn November, uncrewed ground vehicles accounted for less than 0.66% of Ukraine's total drone missions.\n\nUsage numbers were announced on Tuesday by Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander in chief of Ukraine's armed forces, as he gave a statement on the war situation this winter.\n\n\"At the current stage of the war, it is unmanned aerial vehicles that provide about 60% of all strikes on enemy targets,\" Syrskyi wrote.\n\nThe military chief said that in November alone, Ukrainian uncrewed aerial vehicles, or UAVs, carried out over 304,000 missions, striking or destroying roughly 81,500 targets.\n\n\"Over the past six months, this indicator has been constantly growing,\" Syrskyi added.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian uncrewed ground vehicles, or UGVs, carried out 2,000 missions in the same timeframe, he said.\n\nThe statistics underscore just how aerial drones continue to dominate the battlefield in Ukraine. UGVs, an emerging technology, are still finding their footing in the war as Kyiv moves to integrate them at a wider scale among its military units.\n\nAmid the push, dozens of Ukrainian companies and units have been debuting their own UGVs, which can range from miniature buggies to full-size trucks mounted with remote machine gun turrets.\n\nThe ground drones are particularly useful because they can perform dangerous frontline missions that human soldiers would otherwise be required to carry out. Ukrainians are building them to serve a variety of purposes, from direct assaults and mine-clearing to monitoring roads and delivering frontline supplies.\n\nSome units have begun using aerial and ground systems in tandem, such as troops in Pokrovsk who used a UGV to spot incoming Russian vehicles through fog and later attacked with exploding drones.\n\nRussia has also been pioneering new drones, including UGVs for logistics and rocket artillery. On the aerial front, the Kremlin's forces were the first to introduce unjammable, fiber-optic drones that are now proliferating on the battlefield.\n\nThis year, Moscow has repeatedly been reported to be more readily integrating drone warfare into its ranks, scaling up mass production, forming official drone units, and creating new warfighting doctrine after observing Ukrainian tactics.\n\nSyrskyi wrote that Russia had, at one point, reached a \"period of a certain parity\" with Ukraine in the use of first-person-view drones, or the small hobby drones souped up to fly explosives into targets.\n\n\"As reported by our intelligence bodies, the enemy seeks to reach monthly deliveries of up to half a million FPV drones to its troops,\" he wrote.\n\nNow, however, Syrskyi claimed that Ukraine has recently surpassed Russia in first-person-view drone usage.\n\n\"The Ukrainian response must be asymmetric and effective: strengthening the fight against enemy drones and destroying the infrastructure of the enemy's unmanned forces units,\" he added.\n\nSyrskyi's statement offered a grim recap of the war in recent months, saying that Ukraine's forces have \"faced some of the most serious challenges since the beginning of the full-scale war.\"\n\nBoth civilians and soldiers in the country must soon grapple with another brutal winter, as temperatures are expected to consistently drop below freezing in January and February. Russia has been targeting local energy grids, disrupting Ukraine's access to reliable heating.",

    "description": "Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said EV adoption in the US was hampered by a \"shocking lack of choice,\" compared to Europe or China.",
    "fullText": "Rivian's CEO and founder, RJ Scaringe, said the US needs a lot more cheap electric vehicles.\n\nSpeaking at the Fortune Brainstorm AI conference in San Francisco on Tuesday, Scaringe said a lack of choices was the reason for low EV penetration in the US.\n\nHe said that electric vehicle adoption in the US, at 8%, is significantly lower than in the rest of the world.\n\n\"I really think the constraint isn't the demand side, I think it's the supply side,\" Scaringe said. \"I think there's a shocking lack of choice, that there are much better choices in Europe. And by far, there's the most choice in China.\"\n\nHe said that for consumers interested in EVs, there were \"well under five great choices\" at a price point close to the average price of a new car in the US.\n\nHe added that, within a price range of $50,000, there was only one compelling choice of EV: a Tesla. In October, Tesla unveiled its most affordable models to date: the $36,990 Model 3 Standard and the $39,990 Model Y Standard.\n\n\"And that's not a reflection of a healthy market with lots of choice,\" Scaringe said. \"If you think of it as a consumer, you have 300 different internal combustion engine choices at that price or lower, and you have maybe one highly compelling EV choice.\"\n\nRivian is working to provide cheaper EV alternatives. It is gearing up to start production on its cheapest EV to date, the R2 model, a $45,000 SUV.\n\nIn the interview, Scaringe also said he agrees with the Trump administration's push to bring manufacturing back to the US.\n\n\"I think the push to industrialize in the United States is appropriate, and it's something we're very aligned with the administration on,\" he said.\n\nThe US EV industry comprises Rivian, Tesla, Ford, General Motors, Hyundai, BMW, and Kia, among others.\n\nBrands like Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Tesla dominate the EV market in Europe. Chinese brands like BYD, NIO, and MG also sell on the continent.\n\nMeanwhile, the EV industry in China is seeing fierce competition. BYD, Tesla's biggest global rival, saw its sales fall 12% in October compared to the same period a year earlier, as it faces a tough fight from local EV startups Xpeng, Nio, and Leapmotor.\n\nOther players, such as smartphone manufacturer-turned EV maker Xiaomi, are also seeing success in the country with strong sales.",

    "fullText": "Silver blew past $60 per troy ounce for the first time on Tuesday, extending its blistering rally as traders race into a metal increasingly linked to the build-out of AI infrastructure.\n\nThe milestone caps a stunning run in 2025: silver has more than doubled this year, far outpacing gold's roughly 60% gain and leaving many traditional commodity forecasts in the dust.\n\nWhile expectations of further Federal Reserve easing have helped fuel the move, surging industrial demand and persistent supply tightness are also powering silver's fierce price gains.\n\nVeteran Wall Street strategist Ed Yardeni wrote on Tuesday that silver's explosive rally can't be understood without acknowledging its growing importance to the AI economy.\n\nAs AI data-center construction accelerates and chip demand rises, he argues the metal has effectively become \"another AI play.\"\n\nIndustry association The Silver Institute and Oxford Economics reinforced that view in a report released on Tuesday, saying AI's rapid expansion is helping drive growing demand for silver across digital economy applications.\n\n\"As digitalisation and AI adoption accelerate, so too does the demand for critical materials involved in their applications — silver a critical one among them,\" they wrote.\n\nData centers increasingly rely on next-generation chips such as GPUs and TPUs equipped with high-performance semiconductors that use silver in their internal connections and packaging, the association wrote.\n\nAnd as AI moves into autonomous vehicles, robotics, and edge devices, the broader electronics ecosystem is set to draw even more heavily on silver-rich components.\n\nBeyond AI demand, silver remains entrenched in a tight market, with inventories strained and borrowing rates still high despite some easing after October's historic squeeze.\n\n\"This is unquestionably a tight market, stocks are falling, and traders want whatever scraps of silver they can get their hands on,\" wrote Chris Weston, the head of research at Pepperstone, in a Tuesday note.\n\nHe added that retail traders are taking sharp notice of silver's surge, and for good reason.\n\n\"It is an emphatic move, with trend and momentum accounts absolutely bossing the show,\" wrote Weston.\n\nDespite its red-hot rally, the silver trade remains a risky one, Goldman Sachs cautioned in October.\n\nSilver is far more cyclical because of its heavy industrial use, making it a less reliable hedge than gold, the bank said. It also lacks the support of central-bank buying that underpins the yellow metal, Goldman added.",

    "description": "Buford crushes Valdosta in Georgia's Class 6A semifinals then overtakes IMG Academy to move into the top spot in The SN Top 25",
    "fullText": "The Sporting News 2025 High School Football Top 25 — Week 18: December 9 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe run is finally over for the IMG Academy [Bradenton, FL] Ascenders as the No. 1 team in The Sporting News High School Football Top 25 as they give way to the new SN No. 1 Buford [GA] Wolves.\n\nEven worse for the Ascenders, with two undefeated top 5 teams squaring off for Georgia's GHSA Class 6A state championship next week, there's no viable path left for them to climb back into the No. 1 spot. Therefore, they've been officially eliminated from contention for the title of The Sporting News High School Football National Champions.\n\nFor now, the Ascenders settle into the No. 2 spot in The SN Top 25, but they still have to hold off several other teams in order to maintain that position. That includes the SN No. 3 Southlake [TX] Carroll Dragons, SN No. 4 St. Frances Academy [Baltimore, MD] Panthers,SN No. 5 Carrollton [GA] Trojans, and SN No. 6 Allen [TX] Eagles. Any of those teams that win all of their remaining games will also pass IMG Academy in the rankings.\n\nIMG Academy has one remaining hope at clinching a share of the national title. If they can maintain a high enough position in each of the selector lists that are used to compile The Sporting News Composite Rankings, they could theoretically collect enough points there to hold onto the No. 1 position. Currently, they are ranked behind Buford on that list, too, but it's unclear what effect a Wolves' loss to the Carrollton [GA] Trojans would have in that Georgia Class 6A title tilt.\n\nFor now, the Ascenders can only wait and hope that they've done enough.\n\nLike any set of rankings, things may not always make sense at first glance, and there are as many approaches to ranking teams as there are selectors. Some rankings are simply a reflection of what has happened to date, and many of these are algorithm-based, subject to wild weekly swings like the Massey Ratings that are part of The Sporting News Composite Rankings released on Wednesdays.\n\nOther rankings are more predictive – an attempt to account for what has happened, while attempting to line up teams in a way that will reflect potential future results. SN's approach falls somewhere in line with this way of thinking, and each week we first attempt to rank the teams by resume before considering wins and losses and head-to-head results. No system is perfect, but at least understanding our approach can help understand why we have the teams where we do.\n\nAs noted above, Buford has overtaken the previous No. 1 IMG Academy, and the Wolves are a win away from the school's first national championship.\n\nMORE NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL HEADLINES\n\nHow the nation's top teams fared last week including the teams ranked in our composite rankings\n\n2025 Record: 14-0\nLast Week: SN No. 2\n\nNext Game: 12/16/2025 — vs. No. 3/SN No. 5 Carrollton [GA] Trojans\nLast Game: 12/5/2025 — Buford 39, NR Valdosta [GA] Wildcats 7 (12-2)\nW/L Streak: 14 wins\n\nBuford has finally climbed the Top 25 mountain. Now, the question is ... can they stay there? The Wolves are the nation's new No. 1 team, moving ahead of the IMG Academy Ascenders by virtue of a 39-7 win over the Valdosta [GA] Wildcats – a team with a national championship pedigree of its own. Historically, the Wildcats are the Peach State's most successful program at the national level with at least six mythical national titles dating back to 1962. That's good enough to rank fourth in the nation all-time, so it's fitting that the Wolves' potential path to the title went through Valdosta. Now, the Wolves will face the SN No. 5 Carrollton Trojans for a chance to add their name to Georgia's small list of high school football national champions. It's the biggest game in Buford's school history next Tuesday night, and the stakes couldn't be any bigger.\n\n2025 Record: 9-0\nLast Week: SN No. 1\n\nNext Game: Season has concluded\nLast Game: 11/1/2025 — IMG Academy 31, NR Hun [Princeton, NJ] Raiders 13 (7-4)\nW/L Streak: 10 wins\n\nIMG Academy has finally fallen out of the No. 1 position here, and as noted above, there's no viable path remaining for them to regain this position. If anything, they are likely to slip even further, pending results of the four teams lined up directly below them in the rankings. And their only hope of a national title at this point is via the SN Composite Rankings or via one of the other national title selectors.\n\n2025 Record: 14-0\nLast Week: SN No. 4\n\nNext Game: 12/13/2025 — vs. No. 31 DeSoto [TX] Eagles (11-3)\nLast Game: 12/6/2025 — Southlake Carroll 51, NR Guyer [Denton, TX] Wildcats 19 (11-3)\nW/L Streak: 14 wins\n\nAfter fending off a feisty Prosper [TX] Eagles' squad two weeks ago, it was back to the blowouts last week as the Dragons dismantled the Guyer Wildcats. Next up is a DeSoto team that has had its up and downs, but as been riding the highs for several weeks now. This one could be a doozy, and it has the potential to knock Carroll out of the national title picture.\n\n2025 Record: 8-1\nLast Week: SN No. 3\n\nNext Game: 12/10/2025 — vs. NR Corner Canyon [Draper, UT] Chargers (12-1)\nLast Game: 11/1/2025 — St. Frances Academy 35, The St. James Performance Academy [Springfield, VA] Strivers 0 (8-1)\nW/L Streak: 7 wins\n\nSt. Frances Academy has been idle for almost six weeks, but it's finally game week again as the Panthers will take on the Corner Canyon [Draper, UT] Chargers Wednesday night at home in Baltimore in the Overtime Nationals Championship. The game is being billed as a national championship game, but neither the Panthers nor the Chargers remains in contention for the title here in SN's rankings.\n\n2025 Record: 14-0\nLast Week: SN No. 5\n\nNext Game: 12/16/2025 — vs. No. 1/SN No. 1 Buford [GA] Wolves (14-0)\nLast Game: 12/5/2025 — Carrollton 48, NR North Gwinnett [Suwanee, GA] Bulldogs 21 (12-2)\nW/L Streak: 14 wins\n\nCarrollton gets a weekend off, but they'll be busy preparing for their game against No. 1 Buford. The Wolves are guaranteed a national title if they win it; for Carrollton, it's a little shakier with No. 3 Southlake Carroll still ahead of them and in contention for a Texas UIL Class 6A Division II title. It may come down to how the game looks on the field, but either way, it's a game that will help paint the national championship picture here at The Sporting News.\n\n2025 Record: 14-0\nLast Week: SN No. 6\n\nNext Game: 12/13/2025 — vs. No. 18/SN No. 12 Duncanville [TX] Panthers (11-1)\nLast Game: 12/5/2025 — Allen 33, SN No. 25 North Crowley [Fort Worth, TX] Panthers 21 (12-2)\nW/L Streak: 14 wins\n\nFor Allen, the dream of a Sporting News national title is officially over with four teams still ahead of them in the rankings, including Buford and Carrollton, who will face off as noted in Georgia's Class 6A title game. The winner of that is guaranteed to stay ahead of Allen in The SN Top 25 so there is no viable path to the national title here. But, the Eagles are very much alive and in the running for the Texas UIL Class 6A Division I title. They knocked off the defending state champion North Crowley Panthers last week, and next up, is another group of Panthers eager to claim the trophy for their own case. This one could be epic.\n\n2025 Record: 13-1\nLast Week: SN No. 7\n\nNext Game: Season has concluded\nLast Game: 11/28/2025 — SN No. 10 Carrollton [GA] Trojans 34 (13-0), Grayson 14\nW/L Streak: 1 loss\n\nIt was an admirable run for Grayson. After losing their 5-star QB Travis Burgess for the season back in August, they turned the reins over to Deuce Smith who guided the Rams all the way to Georgia's Class 6A quarterfinals. It ended there, and with it, Grayson lost its best chance yet to capture an elusive national title. The good news for the Rams is they'll probably be right back in the thick of it again next year. But that's little consolation right now for a team that had a title within reach.\n\n2025 Record: 13-1\nLast Week: SN No. 8\n\nNext Game: 12/11/2025 — vs. NR Lakeland [FL] Dreadnaughts (12-2)\nLast Game: 12/5/2025 — St. Thomas Aquinas 45, NR Riverdale [Fort Myers, FL] Raiders 13 (12-2)\nW/L Streak: 13 wins\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas will play for Florida's FHSAA Class 5A state championship Thursday night against Lakeland in a rematch of last year's finale. That didn't go so well for the Dreadnaughts who lost their only game of the 2024 season in a 34-0 rout at the hands of the Raiders. And they'll be hard-pressed to overcome this edition of Florida's Class 5A juggernauts, too.\n\n2025 Record: 11-1\nLast Week: SN No. 9\n\nNext Game: Season has concluded\nLast Game: 11/25/2025 — Bishop Gorman 44, NR Arbor View [Las Vegas, NV] Aggies 7 (9-3)\nW/L Streak: 7 wins\n\nBishop Gorman throttled the Arbor View Aggies in Nevada's Open Division state championship game. It wasn't enough to lift them into the national title conversation, but the Gaels will be back next year for another run at national glory.\n\n2025 Record: 11-0\nLast Week: SN No. 11\n\nNext Game: Season has concluded\nLast Game: 11/23/2025 — DeMatha 20, NR Gonzaga [Washington, DC] Eagles 13 (7-5)\nW/L Streak: 21 wins\n\nDeMatha captured the WCAC championship in a hard-fought win over the Gonzaga Eagles. It should be enough to keep them here in the national Top 10 when the dust settles on the playoffs around the rest of the country.\n\n2025 Record: 13-0\nLast Week: SN No. 11\n\nNext Game: 12/13/2025 — vs. NR St. Augustine [New Orleans, LA] Purple Knights (12-1)\nLast Game: 12/5/2025 — Edna Karr 17, NR Catholic [Baton Rouge, LA] Bears 10 (10-3)\nW/L Streak: 27 wins\n\nIt's likely that the best game of Louisiana's Division I Select bracket has already been played; Edna Karr's close call against the Catholic Bears last week resulted in only the Cougars' second one-score game of the season. The first came against the American Heritage [Plantation, FL] Patriots back on September 12 in The Sporting News High School Football Game of the Week. The Patriots ultimately stumbled to a 5-5 finish in the regular season, but have since rebounded to make it to Florida's FHSAA Class 4A state championship game this week. Those results could indicate that this Edna Karr team is a little over-ranked at this point, and they'll have to hold off some undefeated Texas squads lined up behind them here in the Top 25. In the meantime, they can only take care of their own business, and this week, that means a rematch with St. Augustine in the state championship game – a team they beat 42-21 back on October 3. That's the Purple Knights' only loss to date, but we expect their loss column to double by the end of Saturday's matchup with the Cougars.\n\n2025 Record: 11-1\nLast Week: SN No. 12\n\nNext Game: 12/13/2025 — vs. SN No. 6 Allen [TX] Eagles\nLast Game: 12/6/2025 — Duncanville 35, NR Waxahachie [TX] Indians 27 (11-3)\nW/L Streak: 10 wins\n\nDuncanville's only loss this season is a 28-27 setback against Waxahachie way back on September 19. They avenged that loss last Saturday in the playoffs, holding off a furious Indians' rally to snag a 35-27 victory and move on to the state semifinals. Now, their redemption tour continues against No. 6 Allen – a team that just beat the defending state champions form North Crowley. We can't wait to see how this one plays out.\n\n2025 Record: 14-0\nLast Week: SN No. 13\n\nNext Game: 12/12/2025 — vs. NR Lone Star [Frisco, TX] Rangers (14-0)\nLast Game: 12/5/2025 — Aledo 43, NR Ryan [Denton, TX] Raiders 17 (12-2)\nW/L Streak: 14 wins\n\nTwo 14-0 squads will face off when Aledo meets Lone Star Friday night on neutral ground in Mansfield, Texas, and Aledo's championship pedigree – 11 state titles since 2009 – suggests that the Bearcats will be tough to beat. But Lone Star beat another championship program last week in their 58-38 takedown of the Highland Park [Dallas, TX] Scots, and the only way to settle a matchup like this is on the field. We lean toward Aledo, but this Lone Star squad has brought it every week in 2025.\n\n2025 Record: 14-0\nLast Week: SN No. 14\n\nNext Game: 12/12/2025 — vs. NR Boerne [TX] Greyhounds (13-1)\nLast Game: 12/5/2025 — Randle 45, NR Iowa Colony [TX] Pioneers 35 (12-2)\nW/L Streak: 30 wins\n\nRandle has survived two shootouts with Iowa Colony this year, and the gut feel here is that the Lions will have an easier go of it this week against a one-loss Boerne Greyhounds' squad that had its hands full with in a 56-49 shootout win over the Alamo Heights [San Antonio, TX] Mules last week.\n\n2025 Record: 10-3\nLast Week: No. 15\n\nNext Game: 12/13/2025 — vs. NR De La Salle [Concord, CA] Spartans (12-0)\nLast Game: 11/28/2025 — vs. SN No. 3 Centennial [Corona, CA] Huskies (11-1)\nW/L Streak: 5 wins\n\nIt's state championship bowl week in California, and the Santa Margarita Eagles will look to put a bow on their 2025 season against the undefeated former kings of California from De La Salle. Don't let the records fool you – this 10-3 Santa Margarita team is actually the favorite headed into this game, and we expect they'll emerge victorious with a California state title in their first season under Eagles' alum and Heisman Trophy winner Carson Palmer.\n\n2025 Record: 11-2\nLast Week: SN No. 16\n\nNext Game: Season has concluded\nLast Game: 11/28/2025 — SN No. 25 Santa Margarita [Rancho Santa Margarita, CA] Eagles (10-3) 42, Centennial 7\nW/L Streak: 1 loss\n\nThere was only one team Centennial couldn't beat in 2025, and unfortunately, they had to face them twice. In a season when the Huskies finally beat their nemesis Mater Dei twice, they also suffered two losses of their own to one team as Santa Margarita beat them, 33-27, in overtime on August 28 before blowing them out, 42-7, last in the Southern Section championship at the Rose Bowl. That second loss ended the Huskies' season, unfortunately, and they'll spend the offseason ruing their inability to avenge that earlier loss to Santa Margarita.\n\n2025 Record: 14-0\nLast Week: SN No. 17\n\nNext Game: 12/12/2025 — vs. NR Clayton [NC] Comets (12-2)\nLast Game: 12/4/2025 — Grimsley 13, NR Weddington [Matthews, NC] Warriors 7 (13-1)\nW/L Streak: 30 wins\n\nWe suspected Weddington would put up a good fight against Grimsley, and they did, losing just 13-7 last Thursday night. But for Grimsley, a win's a win, and now they'll take on the Clayton Comets in North Carolina's NCHSAA Class 7A state championship game Friday night.\n\n2025 Record: 8-3\nLast Week: SN No. 18\n\nNext Game: Season has concluded\nLast Game: 11/21/2025 — SN No. 3 Centennial [Corona, CA] Huskies (11-1) 28, Mater Dei 27\nW/L Streak: 1 loss\n\nThe Monarchs have finally, officially, abdicated their throne, and it came much earlier than anybody could have expected for a program that entered the season as the unanimous No. 1 team in the country. Mater Dei's loss to Centennial ended their back-to-back run of national titles, but ultimately, the Monarchs will be fine in the long run. They have the best talent in the country in any given year, and they've got a lot of young prospects who should be able to right the ship pretty quickly.\n\n2025 Record: 9-2\nLast Week: SN No. 19\n\nNext Game: Season has concluded\nLast Game: 11/14/2025 — NR Orange [CA] Lutheran Lancers 20 (3-8), St. John Bosco 19\nW/L Streak: 2 losses\n\nAfter a flashy 9-0 start that carried them into the No. 1 position in the SN Top 25, the Braves' season only lasted two more games. First, there was the loss to archrival Mater Dei in the regular-season finale. Then on a rainy Friday night in Southern California, the Braves were ousted from California's Southern Section playoffs in one of the most shocking postseason results in Golden State history. A season that once appeared destined to end in another national championship for St. John Bosco terminated instead in the opening round of California's postseason, and the Braves will spend the offseason assessing how it all unraveled so quickly.\n\n2025 Record: 13-1\nLast Week: SN No. 20\n\nNext Game: 12/12/2025 — vs. NR Melissa [TX] Cardinals (13-1)\nLast Game: 12/5/2025 — South Oak Cliff 28, NR Port Neches [TX]-Groves Indians 0 (13-1)\nW/L Streak: 12 wins\n\nThe Bears had no problem against the previously undefeated Port Neches-Groves Indians last week, and they won't have any issues this coming Friday night against the Melissa Cardinals. We're expecting them to roll and set up a meeting with Randle – a rematch of 2024's Texas UIL Class 5A Division II title game.\n\n2025 Record: 13-0\nLast Week: SN No. 21\n\nNext Game: Season has concluded\nLast Game: 12/6/2025 — Bixby 31, NR Owasso [OK] Rams 17 (10-3)\nW/L Streak: 16 wins\n\nBixby got a little bit of a fight from Owasso last Saturday, but it takes more than that to take down this group of Spartans who are now Oklahoma's OSSAA Class 6A Division I champions.\n\n2025 Record: 12-0\nLast Week: SN No. 22\n\nNext Game: Season has concluded\nLast Game: 12/4/2025 — Baylor 28, NR Brentwood [TN] Academy Eagles 24 (11-1)\nW/L Streak: 12 wins\n\nBaylor and Brentwood Academy put on quite a show in the rain, but in the end, it was the Red Raiders' night in what was the Red Raiders' season. They are your Tennessee TSSAA Division II-AAA state champions.\n\n2025 Record: 14-0\nLast Week: No. 23\n\nNext Game: 12/15/2025 — vs. NR Benedictine [Savannah, GA] Cadets (11-2)\nLast Game: 12/5/2025 — Creekside 35, NR Kell [Marietta, GA] Longhorns 6 (11-3)\nW/L Streak: 14 wins\n\nCreekside is one win away from being crowned Georgia's GHSA Class 4A state champions, and they've yet to play a game closer than 20 points this year. Benedictine didn't get here by laying down and surrendering to anybody, but we also expect they'll find this Seminoles' team to be a little beyond their reach.\n\n2025 Record: 15-0\nLast Week: SN No. 24\n\nNext Game: Season has concluded\nLast Game: 12/5/2025 — Clay-Chalkville 38, NR Saraland [AL] Spartans 21 (13-1)\nW/L Streak: 15 wins\n\nClay-Chalkville finished off a perfect season last Friday night in a 38-21 win over Saraland, and they conclude the 2025 season as the top-ranked team in Alabama as the AHSAA Class 6A champions.\n\n2025 Record: 12-0\nLast Week: Unranked\n\nNext Game: 12/13/2025 — vs. Santa Margarita [Rancho Santa Margarita, CA] Eagles (10-3)\nLast Game: 12/21/2025 — De La Salle 24, Pittsburg [CA] Pirates (11-3)\nW/L Streak: 10 wins\n\nDe La Salle hasn't seen the field in three weeks, waiting on California's Southern Section to be decided. They are 12-0, but it will take all they've got and then some to beat this 10-3 Santa Margarita. They'll likely have to do it by playing a defensive battle because it's unlikely they could score enough in a shootout against this Eagles' defense that might be the best in the country.\n\nSN No. 4 St. Frances Academy [Baltimore, MD] Panthers vs. NR Corner Canyon [Draper, UT] Chargers (12-1) — 7 p.m. EST local\n\nSN No. 8 St. Thomas Aquinas [Fort Lauderdale, FL] Raiders (13-1) vs. NR Lakeland [FL] Dreadnaughts (12-2) — 7:30 p.m. EST local\n\nSN No. 13 Aledo [TX] Bearcats (13-0) vs. NR Lone Star [Frisco, TX] Rangers — 8 p.m. EST (7 p.m. CST local)\n\nSN No. 14 Randle [Richmond, TX] Lions (13-0) vs. NR Boerne [TX] Greyhounds (13-1) — 8 p.m. EST (7 p.m. CST local)\n\nSN No. 17 Grimsley [Greensboro, NC] Whirlies (14-0) vs. NR Clayton [NC] Comets (12-2) — 8 p.m. EST local\n\nSN No. 20 South Oak Cliff [Dallas, TX] Bears (12-1) vs. NR Melissa [TX] Cardinals (13-1) — 8:30 p.m. EST (7:30 p.m. CST local)\n\nSN No. 3 Southlake [TX] Carroll Dragons (13-0) vs. NR DeSoto [TX] Eagles (11-3) — 3 p.m. EST (2 p.m. CST local)\n\nSN No. 6 Allen [TX] Eagles vs. SN No. 12 Duncanville [TX] Panthers (11-1) — 4 p.m. EST (3 p.m. CST local)\n\nSN No. 11 Edna Karr [New Orleans, LA] Cougars (13-0) vs. NR St. Augustine [New Orleans, LA] Purple Knights (12-1) — 4:30 p.m. EST (3:30 p.m. CST local)\n\nSN No. 15 Santa Margarita [Rancho Santa Margarita, CA] Eagles (10-3) vs. SN No 25 De La Salle [Concord, CA] Spartans (12-0) — 11 p.m. EST (8 p.m. PST local)\n\nSN No. 23 Creekside [Fairburn, GA] Seminoles (14-0) vs. NR Benedictine [Savannah, GA] Cadets (11-2) — 7 p.m. EST local\n\nSN No. 1 Buford [GA] Wolves (14-0); SN No. 2 IMG Academy [Bradenton, FL] Ascenders (9-0); SN No. 5 Carrollton [TX] Trojans (14-0); SN No. 7 Grayson [Loganville, GA] Rams (12-1); SN No. 9 Bishop Gorman [Las Vegas, NV] Gaels (11-1); SN No. 10 DeMatha [Hyattsville, MD] Stags (11-0); SN No. 16 Centennial [Corona, CA] Huskies (11-2); SN No. 18 Mater Dei [Santa Ana, CA] Monarchs (8-3); SN No. 19 St. John Bosco [Bellflower, CA] Braves (9-2); SN No. 21 Bixby [OK] Spartans (13-0); SN No. 22 Baylor [Chattanooga, TN] Red Raiders (12-0); SN No. 24 Clay-Chalkville [Pinson, AL] Cougars (15-0)\n\nMORE HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PLAYOFF HEADLINES\n\nFlorida 2025 playoff brackets (7A/6A/5A/4A)\n\nGeorgia 2025 playoff brackets (6A/5A/4A)\n\nLouisiana 2025 playoff brackets (Division I/II)\n\nOklahoma 2025 playoff brackets (6A/5A/4A)\n\nTexas 2025 playoff brackets (6A/5A/4A)",

    "description": "LPGA winners Ryann O'Toole, Hinako Shibuno and Jodi Ewart Shadoff all re-earn their full playing privileges in Q-Series Final",
    "fullText": "Ryann O’Toole didn’t imagine she would put this on her December itinerary, but there she was playing golf in Alabama this past week trying to salvage her LPGA Tour card. It was a wise decision.\n\nThe 38-year-old O’Toole, a UCLA alum who first gained recognition as a competitor on Golf Channel’s “Big Break,” has won one tournament on tour, and she has the chance to add more titles after shooting a bogey-free 65 with seven birdies on Tuesday in the final round of LPGA Q-Series Final Qualifying in Mobile. In the event shortened from 90 holes to 72 because of a day lost to bad weather, O’Toole finished tied for third at 11 under and was the top American qualifier. The top 25 and ties earned their tour card, with 31 golfers being the final total at Robert Trent Jones Trail Magnolia Grove.\n\nO’Toole has 20 career top-10s, but she made the cut in only half her 16 starts in 2025, with no top-10s, and finished 137th on the CME Points Rankings.\n\n“The last time I was here [at Q-Series] was 2014, and I told myself after that week, I never want to have to be back,” O’Toole said. “But you never know what happens, and here I was back having to re-qualify. It's stressful, it's a grind, it's mentally and emotionally draining. Then this week, with just the weather, I mean it being freezing, the delays, the rain, every single morning was early. … It became a physical grind.\n\n“I just think there's so much emotion that goes into this that it is a tough week. With 15 years on tour, there are mixed emotions going into it. I wasn't sure if I was even going to decide to go back to Q School or if I was just going to start the next chapter of my life. But at the same time it would be really weird to start January 1 and go, ‘What do you mean I don't have full status? What do you mean? I'm not a professional on the LPGA?’ That wasn't OK for me.”\n\nGerman golfer Helen Briem earned her LPGA Tour card in impressive fashion. She shot a four-under 68 to earn medalist honors at 13 under. Briem, 20, moves to the LPGA after having played on the Ladies European Tour.\n\n“Right now, I'm a bit lost for words. I entered this week with not a lot of expectations,” said Brie. “But, overall, I'm really happy that I am able to play LPGA next year, and that’s really cool.”\n\nMajor winner Hinako Shibuno, arguably the most popular Japanese golfer, got her tour card back again, too. The 2019 AIG Women’s British Open champion made it on the number at five under after closing with a 72. Shibuno, 27, struggled on the LPGA this season, making just 10 cuts in 23 starts while notching only one top-10 finish.\n\nAnother veteran to re-earn her card is former European Solheim Cup player Jodi Ewart Shadoff. The 37-year-old, who won her lone LPGA title in 2022 and has top-10 finishes in three of the tour’s five majors, shot 71 and was among the final eight players who tied for 24th.\n\nAmong the notable players who missed getting their cards was 17-year-old Floridian Gianna Clemente, who turned pro this year, advanced through Second Stage and fell three shots off the cut. Kim Kaufman, 34, who battled breast cancer this year and finished chemotherapy in the summer, finished at four over. Among the past college stars who didn’t get their cards were 2023 U.S. Women’s Amateur champion and Auburn alum Megan Schofill (even par), 2024 NCAA individual champion Adela Cernousek of Texas A&M (16 over), USC’s Amari Avery (one under) and Wake Forest’s Rachel Kuehn (eight over).",

    "description": "The Zac Taylor hot seat conversation is back.",
    "fullText": "The Cincinnati Bengals remain on track to miss the playoffs once again, which means the conversation about the Zac Taylor hot seat has fired up in a big way.\n\nIt didn’t take long for the topic to surface, either, given the loss in Buffalo that snatched hope from the franchise about the playoffs just as quickly as Joe Burrow’s return provided it.\n\nTechnically speaking, the Bengals aren’t mathematically eliminated from the playoffs right now. But the Bengals need a miracle in the form of help while also winning out.\n\nIf and when the Bengals do miss the playoffs, that will mean the Bengals have missed the playoffs five times over the course of Taylor’s seven years as head coach.\n\nSome of those years were spent rebuilding, of course, and the playoff appearances led to AFC title game appearances at a minimum.\n\nEven so, the luster of those big moments continues to fade, hence the conversation about Taylor’s hot seat this upcoming offseason.\n\nTODAY’s loss was not Zac Taylor’s fault.\n\nBUT… the reason that today’s loss was season-ending IS 100% Zac Taylor’s fault.\n\nZac Taylor lost us the Broncos, Lions, Steelers, Bears, and Jets games, among others. \n\nZAC TAYLOR NEEDS TO GO.\n\n— AndreBengals (@AndreBengals) December 7, 2025\n\nThe Bengals will at best have four full years between playoff games.

    "fullText": "The last time Brandon Royval had his hand raised in the octagon, fans witnessed one of the best fights in UFC flyweight history.\n\nBack in October 2024, Royval went to war with Japanese contender Tatsuro Taira in the main event of UFC Fight Night 244. It was a wild affair with many ups and downs for both fighters, but in the end, Royval was able to out-slug and outlast Taira to win a close, split decision. It was one hell of a fight that won the Fight of the Night award.\n\nYou can watch Royval's gutsy win over Taira in the video above.\n\nRoyval (17-8 MMA, 7-4 UFC) is scheduled to get back into action this Saturday in the main event of UFC Fight Night 266 (ESPN+), which takes place at the UFC Apex in Las Vegas.

A replay review confirmed the shot beat the buzzer.\n\nVille Husso made 45 saves, including seven in overtime, and stopped all three shots in the shootout.\n\nJackson LaCombe and Troy Terry also scored for the Ducks.

    "fullText": "Blake Lizotte hits the IR, so Danton Heinen is back in Pittsburgh to fill in. Connor Clifton is back in the game lineup and Arturs Silovs gets his first start since November 29th.\n\nTonight's lineup vs. the Ducks.#LetsGoPens pic.twitter.com/hId0VXXwHi\n\n— Pittsburgh Penguins (@penguins) December 9, 2025\n\nThe visiting, but still very loudly orange Anaheim Ducks have this lineup for the night:\n\nHere's who we fly with. #FlyTogether pic.twitter.com/xKADvUaTDl\n\n— Anaheim Ducks (@AnaheimDucks) December 10, 2025\n\nThe two teams have no problems trading end-to-end rushes and lots of shots and chances early. The first goal, however, comes on a bit of a broken play- Heinen got kicked out of the face off circle and Noel Acciari moved in as a replacement. The faceoff was a 50/50 play that Connor Dewar was able to direct back to Acciari with his skate. Acciari used the bounce to quickly fling a shot in goal, and it sailed right on by Ville Husso, thanks to the screen from Dewar and the Duck defending him. 1-0 Pens.\n\n🍪🚨 pic.twitter.com/Z4wK0F7CXI\n\n— Pittsburgh Penguins (@penguins) December 10, 2025\n\nJustin Brazeau is tripped, the Pens get the game’s first power play but can’t capitalize on it. Soon after that penalty ends, Dewar is cross-checked to give the Pens another chance, again they don’t do much with it in terms of generating chances.\n\nEnd of the first, 16-8 are the shots in favor of Pittsburgh.\n\nPittsburgh can’t score on the carryover power play and get a few other very close calls, can’t get the puck over the line again. Anaheim uses that to tie the game up. The Ducks win an offensive zone faceoff and defenseman Jackson Lacombe skates right by Bryan Rust. With almost no angle left, Lacombe lifts a shot way high that banks in off Silovs and into the net. 1-1 game.\n\nTalk about scoring from a sharp angle 📐 pic.twitter.com/KBPWGLx6iS\n\nThe Pens get a third power play, again no good. Ville Koivunen somehow avoids a hooking penalty despite going water skiing on a backcheck. Instead the refs call Heinen for a minor a bit later to give Anaheim a second crack at their power play. Pittsburgh kills that off but the Ducks are still able to find the next goal. Rust, Crosby and Karlsson all have opportunities to clear the puck, none can and before you know it Troy Terry has the puck on his stick and he quickly goes top shelf on Silovs. 2-1 ANA.\n\n🚨 Terry 🚨\n\nThe T stands for Top shelf! \nWe lead 2-1! #FlyTogether pic.twitter.com/DPkUoIk33i\n\n— Anaheim Ducks (@AnaheimDucks) December 10, 2025\n\nTommy Novak becomes a focal point late in the period, nearly scoring on a shot/pass with Crosby at the backdoor and the puck hitting Husso’s pads and somehow not trickling in. Novak creates better luck when he shoots from in tight, collects his rebound and even though his momentum took him behind the net Novak was able to quickly sling the puck off the back of Husso and in. 2-2 to go into intermission.\n\nShots are 29-18 PIT overall in the game, but the score is tied up 2-2.\n\nSome tied third periods teams are virtually watching the clock to get to overtime. This was not one of those games. Both teams were fine with trading odd man rushes and skating the puck as quickly as they could to generate offense.\n\nTowards the end of the period it was the Pens’ third line of young players that again amped up the pressure in a major way. A collision between Kris Letang and Radko Gudas left Gudas smarting and at times doubled over in pain. The Duck defenders were tiring and Husso had a to grab a stick to help his cause. The refs actually call the penalty on the goalie, late in the third period. Surprising, but warranted. Wouldn’t you know, the Pens power play comes through. It’s a very fortunate play, Anthony Mantha is centering the puck when Husso leans his stick out to try and break it up. Husso fails in a major way, turns out being bad luck for him to redirect the puck into his own net. 3-2 with just 3:55 to play.\n\nMANTHA BOUGHT EVERYBODY BIG MACS!\n\nHere's how to cash in your @McDonalds offer: https://t.co/QH7j1DPz1i pic.twitter.com/Ec13oX0OGf\n\n— Pittsburgh Penguins (@penguins) December 10, 2025\n\nAnaheim pulls their goalie, the Pens nearly score but can’t quite do it. Chris Kreider goes to the box for Anaheim with 17 seconds left and it seems like that should be about it for their chances. Turns out, it’s not. With time running down rookie Bennett Sennecke drives to the net. He swings in a desperation effort with one hand on his stick; more a centering pass than a shot. But the pucks hits off Karlsson’s glove and goes into the net with 0.1 seconds left. Unreal.\n\n🚨SENNECKE BEATS THE BUZZER!! 🚨\n\nWe tie the game with under 1 second left!#FlyTogether pic.twitter.com/CMYCB7T22J\n\n— Anaheim Ducks (@AnaheimDucks) December 10, 2025\n\nShocking goal to give up there with a game that should have been in the bag.\n\nThe Pens can’t score on the carryover power play, action goes back to 3v3. Kindel almost sets Letang up for a winner, Karlsson and Crosby make some magic but for some reason Connor Dewar is the third player out there with them at the time. Dewar has a wide open net but can only hit the post.\n\nPittsburgh uses their timeout to give the top players a breather. They come close, no cigar.\n\nNovak is the first up, his shot to the glove side is stopped by Husso.\n\nLeo Carlsson is up for Anaheim, a deke to the backhand works perfectly.\n\nCrosby goes for the Pens, shoots it right into the glove.\n\nTroy Terry takes his turn, shoots wide. Didn’t have much to shoot at.\n\nVille Koivunen comes in with speed, maybe a little too much as he runs out of space and barely gets a shot away. Doesn’t work.\n\nThe SNP broadcast mentioned this was the seventh straight game (highest active streak in league) for the Penguins to score a goal in the first period. Obvious but no less true that makes foe a great way to setup the rest of the game.\n\nThen again, with the Pens losing a lead in the third period for a third straight game, playing while ahead has proved to be a difficult proposition for them. Giving up the tying goal while on the power play with 0.1 seconds is a new low, even for them. It’s shuddering to think what new ways they’ll find to blow leads from here on out if this isn’t rock bottom in that category I don’t know what could be.\n\nThe Ducks are fun, but oh brother they don’t know how to defend a lick. Not sure how long they’re going to last near the top of the standings but they will be a great watch this season due to the wide-open style of play and all the quality young players that are figuring it out at the NHL level.\n\nMcGroarty’s getting close to a goal, love the way he’s grinding and his puck touches lately down by the net. You can tell it’s coming for him, three shots on goal in the first 8:34 of the game alone.\n\nThe whole line with McGroarty, Ville Koivunen and Ben Kindel has been aces. The Pens may have found something there, certainly for the foreseeable future. Nice players and complimentary skills blending together between that trio. Lots of players had great nights on the ol’ Corsi and expected goals outlook for the Pens given the way it played out, none better than those three who were at 27-11 in shot attempts and up 1.9 – 0.3 in expected goals while on the ice. Sadly, played it even in actuals.\n\n1 for 5 power play on the night that salvaged their efforts with the late (and somewhat fluky, if not fortunate) goal that they gave back in the game’s dying seconds. Gross night overall by the power play. It was o fer 5 since Evgeni Malkin has been hurt before that point. Replacing him and the whole unit strategy about who gets positioned where is all out of whack right now. By the second period power play it was Crosby out by the blueline passing harmlessly with Erik Karlsson and that’s not going to be the recipe for success. Team needs some work there to reconfigure things there.\n\nThe ice looked awful, puck was bouncing around and rolling a ton for both teams. Got worse as the night wore on. Ironically though the ice had nothing to do with the crazy bounces off goalies and defenders that caused goals late in the game.\n\nDon’t look now but that’s points in four straight games (and three goals in that stretch) for Novak. Nice for him to heat up, he’s up to five goals on the season. He’s streaky like that, now the only question will be how much hay can he make while the sun is shining? Nice to see a top-six winger step up and produce.\n\nSilovs hasn’t won a game since November 6th and he narrowly found a way to avoid breaking that streak. Moneypuck had expected goals at 7.03 – 1.88 in the Pens’ favor. Silovs gave up three and for being a big goalie he has a way to shrink away in the key moments (like the first and third goals of the game). At least by stopping 1 of 2 shootout efforts he somehow improved his stats in that metric.\n\nWell, at least the Pens tried new players for the shootout, but their over-arching problem of not having enough quality performers continues. They don’t have anyone who can reliably make the deke that Leo Carlsson did at the pace he did and then place a backhand shot to the top like that. Giving Novak a chance was a good move since he was a hot player and curling and dragging the puck all over, can’t knock using Koivunen either. The simple explanation, though frustrating, is that the Penguins are simply bound to lose more shootouts than they win until they acquire enough players who are good at that specific and toolsy skill. They don’t have it right now.\n\nOf course, a night like this shouldn’t have required a shootout in the first place. The Pens poured chances on Husso, but he stood tall. That’s pretty annoying considering he’s been waived and has played more AHL games than NHL games this season and isn’t particularly good, yet Pittsburgh made him look like a brick wall that stopped 45 out of 48 shots and was only beaten on a deception play (Acciari), a weird goal from behind the net (Novak) and a tough bounce (Mantha).\n\nWould have been nice to comeback with about 1:30 left on the 4v3 OT power play and seal the game up. Mantha had just scored a goal a few game minutes earlier so it’s tough to keep him off the ice in that situation but he looked like a fish out of water in that scenario. Easy to Monday Morning Quarterback it, but they needed someone for net-front to let Karlsson and Crosby create off the space opened up by that instead of Mantha hanging out by the blueline. Alas.\n\nFrustrating outcome, the Pens probably deserved a better result — but then again they got a little sloppy and were forced to pay for it too. They’ll need to shrug it off and get ready for the next one on Thursday against Montreal.",

    "fullText": "MADISON – This is a big offseason for the Wisconsin football team.\n\nThe Badgers have suffered two straight losing seasons. In order to avoid a third, the team is going to need to make some major acquisitions through the transfer portal. They will also say goodbye to some players who are in search of more playing time or a fresh start.\n\nHere is our running list of who is coming and going for the Badgers.\n\nThe transfer portal for football is open from Jan. 2-16, but some players have already announced their intention to transfer.\n\nGriffin announced his departure Dec. 9. He sat out the 2024 season, per NCAA transfer rules, and missed the final seven games of ’25 due to injury. The 6-4, 210-pound receiver caught one pass for 5 yards this season, but he showed the ability to be a quality red zone/jump ball threat during spring practice and fall camp and made 43 catches for 579 yards during his two seasons at Boston College. He has one year of eligibility remaining.\n\nThe backfield was crowded this season and with the Badgers’ top three rushers expected to return in 2026 it will be hard for a fourth back to get carries. Yacamelli's 38 carries this season were a career high. He finished fifth on the team with 128 rushing yards. He had 571 rushing yards and averaged 5.3 yards per carry in three seasons at UW. Yacameilli, who announced his decision on Dec. 9, has one year of eligibility remaining.\n\nThe native of Sydney, Australia, who announced his decision Dec. 6, was the Badgers’ starting punter in 2023 and ’24 and started the first half of the '25 season before redshirt freshman Sean West took over. During the second half of the season Bertrams was called on to punt near midfield where his touch and ability to pin opponents inside the 20 proved valuable. This season 18 of his 37 punts were downed inside the 20.\n\nMoss, a cousin of former Badgers star running back Brent Moss, redshirt this season. The 6-1, 194-pound defensive back who hails from Dumfries, Va., has four years of eligibility remaining. He announced his decision on Dec. 4.\n\nThe former four-star recruit never found his way on the field for the Badgers. The 5-10, 186-pound graduate of Bollingbrook High School near Chicago played five games for UW but didn’t have a catch. He has three years of eligibility remaining. He announced his decision on Dec. 4.\n\nThe 6-4, 234-pound outside linebacker from Shelby, Mich. announced his intention to transfer Dec. 2. He didn’t see any game action in two years. He has three years of eligibility remaining.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Wisconsin football transfer portal tracker. Who's going, arriving",

    "fullText": "Quarterback recruiting in the 2026 cycle was a breeze for Arizona State. It identified El Paso (Texas) Del Valle four-star quarterback Jake Fette as a top target and landed his commitment in September of 2024.\n\nThe Rivals top-100 prospect saw his stock soar heading into his senior season and that led to other high-profile programs checking in. Fette stayed solid with the Sun Devils, though, signing with the Big 12 program last week. He’s the No. 7 QB in the Rivals300.\n\nWith National Signing Day for the 2026 cycle now in the past, many are now getting a feel for the 2027 board. When looking at junior QBs, though, many are already committed. Of the top 25 signal-callers in the cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, 14 are pledged.\n\nAccording to the Rivals Recruiting Prediction Machine, Arizona State is trending for one of the top uncommitted 2027 QBs in the nation. Once again, he resides in the Lone Star State.\n\nBastrop (Texas) four-star QB Weston Nielsen told Rivals’ Sam Spiegelman at the end of September that no program was recruiting him harder than ASU. Now, Spiegelman has been joined by Rivals’ Steve Wiltfong, who logged a pick this month in favor of the Sun Devils landing Nielsen’s commitment.\n\nThe 6-foot-1, 175-pounder will announce his commitment this Saturday, Dec. 13. Arrows continue to point toward Tempe and Kenny Dillingham.\n\n“They still sit pretty high on my board after another visit,” Nielsen told Spiegelman this fall. “They are recruiting me the hardest. They were able to tell me about their program and why they are a good place to be. I definitely felt more connected with them when I left.”\n\nNielsen eclipsed 3,000 passing yards for the second season in a row this fall. Bastrop went 10-3 and the blue-chipper threw 44 touchdowns to just six interceptions. He also rushed for five scores and now has over 100 total TDs to his name at the high school level.\n\nNielsen is the No. 269 overall prospect and No. 20 QB in the 2027 cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, a weighted average that utilizes all major recruiting media companies. He’s also the No. 42 player in Texas.\n\nThe Sun Devils opened their 2027 class earlier this month by landing a pledge from Chino Hills (Calif.) Orange Lutheran four-star wide receiver Nico Bland. He checks in as the No. 188 recruit and No. 23 WR in the nation.\n\nAlong with Fette, ASU signed 18 other prospects and compiled the No. 35 class in the nation, according to the Rivals Industry Team Recruiting Rankings. The class can be seen here.",

    "description": "“When your plus-minus, and your offense and defense is where we’re at, we’re taking some strides. We understand there’s another level we can get to.”",
    "fullText": "At 15-6, the Houston Rockets have moved just past the quarter pole of the 82-game regular season. That total of six losses is tied for the second-fewest in the 2025-26 Western Conference.\n\nYet, the Rockets aren’t entirely satisfied. They rank second in the NBA in overall net rating (+10.8) and defensive rating, trailing only the defending champion Oklahoma City Thunder. They are fourth in offensive rating.\n\nOf those six losses, five were games that could have been won in the fourth quarter. Crunch-time execution, particularly in half-court situations, has been an occasional issue. So, with a team led by a pair of 2025 All-Stars in Kevin Durant and Alperen Sengun, the Rockets believe they’re capable of more.\n\nComing off Saturday’s short-handed loss at Dallas on night two of a split back-to-back, the Rockets are currently in a rare scheduling break, with their next game not coming until Thursday (home versus the Los Angeles Clippers).\n\nSo, in the aftermath of a stretch with five games in seven nights, head coach Ime Udoka allowed his weary team to take Sunday and Monday off, entirely.\n\nBut Tuesday, the Rockets were back at it inside their Houston practice facility, and team activities included both a film session and a competitive practice.\n\nSpeaking post-practice, Udoka offered this assessment to local reporters (via Space City Home Network, SCHN):\n\nIt’s always good to dive into what we’ve done, and look at some trends. And then, we attack those on the court.\n\nWe want to be great, but I think we’ve been good, overall. If you look at the record, 15-6, there are some positives there. But we also feel like we let some (games) slip away, so we’re trying to find the areas where we’ve grown or had some slippage in. Overall, it’s good, but we’re trying to be better than good.\n\nWhat we looked at, today, was where we were at after the first 10 games, and what was happening in the last 11. You see some good and bad trends, overall. But for the most part, when your plus-minus is where we’re at, and offense and defense is where we’re at, we’re taking some good strides. We understand there’s another level we can get to.\n\nAs far as identifying potential issues beyond crunch-time execution. the Rockets are also 0-2 on night two of back-to-backs and 15-4 in all other settings. Fortunately, they have only one back-to-back (at Denver and Sacramento on Dec. 20 and 21) remaining this month, and they hope to have additional roster reinforcements — namely, Tari Eason and Dorian Finney-Smith — before the volume of back-to-backs increases in January.\n\nThursday’s tipoff versus the Clippers (6-18) is at 7:00 p.m. Central from Toyota Center, and the game will be televised regionally on SCHN and nationally via NBA League Pass.\n\nMore: Tari Eason, Dorian Finney-Smith hope to rejoin Rockets in coming weeks\n\nIme Udoka meets with the media after the #Rockets returned to practice today\nThe team last played on Saturday the final game of 5 games in 7 days\nNext up the Clippers at home Thursday.@HoustonRockets I #AllFire pic.twitter.com/0odUbry02R\n\n— Space City Home Network (@SpaceCityHN) December 9, 2025\n\nThis article originally appeared on Rockets Wire: Ime Udoka: 15-6 Rockets are good, but striving for ‘better than good’",

    "title": "Caroline Dubois left BOXXER for Jake Paul's MVP because Ben Shalom 'can't bring what I'm looking for'",
    "description": "WBC lightweight champion Dubois is the latest addition to Paul's star-studded roster of women's boxing talent.",
    "fullText": "WBC lightweight champion Caroline Dubois is the latest addition to Most Valuable Promotion's star-studded roster of women's boxing talent. Dubois, 24, is considered to be one of the top rising stars of the female code and thus a key signing for Jake Paul's promotion, who aims to dominate that side of the sport.\n\nThere's no time to waste for the 2020 Olympian, who debuts for MVP in just 10 days when she defends her title against Camilla Panatta on the undercard of Paul's Netflix boxing match with Anthony Joshua on Dec. 19 in Miami.\n\n\"It was a decision that took a lot of thought,\" Dubois said Tuesday on Uncrowned's \"The Ariel Helwani Show\" about leaving her longtime promoter, Ben Shalom's BOXXER. \"It was a long process. We've been talking back and forth with [MVP co-founder] Nakisa [Bidarian], with the representatives from MVP, and it was just one of the moves that made the most sense. I'm at this point in my career where the sky's the limit, and there's such a massive ceiling, and there's so much on the line for myself.\n\n\"I want to become undisputed [champion]. I want to do this, I want to do that, and we have to make the decision in terms of what's going to be the best route to get me to where I want to be. MVP has signed up a lot of the females in my division. They're constantly putting the money where their mouth is, backing, supporting and investing in women's boxing, and I feel like it would've been stupid not to sign with them.\"\n\nDubois' previous promoter, BOXXER, lost its television deal with Sky Sports this past June, which allowed her to become a free agent and explore the market — although according to Dubois, that exploration went no further than speaking with MVP. The Brit said she rejected two prior offers from Paul's promotion but ultimately decided the third made by the American company was too good to turn down.\n\nNews of Dubois' impending exit from BOXXER was made apparent earlier this month when a clip of Shalom speaking about Dubois' status with the company gained traction on social media. Shalom claimed he was streamlining his talent stable and insinuated Dubois hadn't made the cut. However, Uncrowned understands — and Dubois confirmed — that BOXXER did offer her a renewal, which she declined.\n\n\"They did [try to re-sign me],\" Dubois said of BOXXER. \"Ben came with an offer, and they just couldn't compete with what MVP was offering. It's a shame, obviously, but I feel like I'm at this point right now where I need to be selfish and I need to think about what's going to push the Caroline Dubois train as far and as fast as it can go, and I feel like MVP is the best route for that.\"\n\n👀 Ben Shalom asked if Caroline Dubois is still a BOXXER fighter: \"We're in a situation now where we have to make decisions on who we can really invest in, who's going to sell the tickets, who's going to perform, who's going to do the big viewing numbers, and that's where we have… pic.twitter.com/pr77X2QNlD\n\n— EverythingBoxing | Darshan Desai (@EverythingBoxi2) December 2, 2025\n\n\"When I first read that — I'll be honest — the first reaction was to be slightly offended, because Ben did try very hard to re-sign me,\" Dubois added of Shalom's quote. \"I was actually sitting down in the living room with my sister when I first read the quote, watched the interview, and I was like, 'Oh, what's he trying to say?' I showed it to my sister, and I was like, 'Isn't that slightly offensive?' And she was like, 'Think about it from his point of view — what can he say?'\"\n\n\"Boxing is in such an interesting situation. All the promoters are trying to get at each other, they want to kick each other when they're down. Obviously me leaving him is going to be a soft spot for him. He tried to negate it and make it seem a different type of way. I understand why he said that, and I wish him the best. I believe if he's in it for the long run, he'll be able to come through whatever this dip is that he's going through right now. I'm not really upset by it anymore. It doesn't really matter to me. I'm focused on my own career, my own journey. I think you'll see that Caroline Dubois — she brings everything that [Shalom] says he is looking for. It's just unfortunately he can't bring what I'm looking for.\"\n\nDubois explained that a vital key to her decision to exit BOXXER was the company's switch from Sky Sports to the BBC, which is available in far more UK households but is paying a fraction of the rights fees and staging far fewer shows. MVP also houses two other champions at lightweight — Terri Harper and Stephanie Han — and has a host of big names Dubois can fight, including Alycia Baumgardner.\n\nIn Dubois' ideal world, she would unify with Harper first and then face the winner of Han vs. Holly Holm, which would put her in a prime position for a major fight against Baumgardner.\n\nMVP has a host of British talent but has yet to stage a show in the UK. Dubois expects 2026 to include MVP's expansion across the pond, where a fight between Dubois and Harper would be a perfect fit.\n\nBoth Dubois and Harper have been receptive to a unification fight, so it should be makeable with them both under the same banner. One match Dubois, however, doesn't think will be so easy to make is a fight with unified 130-pound champion Baumgardner, who has been dismissive of Dubois.\n\n\"100% she will [try to avoid the fight],\" Dubois said of Baumgardner. \"She will try to say, 'What has Caroline done? She's not on my level.' But if we're being honest, she needs me just as much as I need her. Women's boxing needs to have big fights happen. We're missing out on that, unfortunately. She needs to be involved in a big fight. She hasn't been involved in a big fight for a long time.\n\n\"I think me versus Alycia Baumgardner is a massive fight. I think it's the biggest fight in women's boxing. For that to happen, it needs to be built up, it needs to have the needle, it needs to have the belts on the line, and the way we can do that is by me unifying and collecting as many belts as I can. And I know that she wouldn't want to fight me unless I bring a massive dangling carrot to motivate her to get in the ring.\"",

    "fullText": "Ricky Saints cost Je'Von Evans the NXT Championship in his challenge against Oba Femi in the main event of \"WWE NXT.\"\n\nEvans interrupted Saints earlier in the show as the former champion sought a rematch for the title he had lost at Deadline. And given that Evans was the Iron Survivor coming out of the same event, he made the case that he should get the next opportunity at the title and didn't want to wait for New Year's Evil. Saints originally pushed back on the idea, but Evans appeared to talk him down and he stepped aside for Evans to challenge Femi in the main event.\n\nThe challenger went on to endure everything the champion could throw at him, getting the better of things on the outside of the ring before returning and seeming to have the match under wraps. He connected with his springboard cutter and went for what looked like the winning cover, only for the referee to be yanked from the ring before the three-count could be made.\n\nEvans turned to realize that it was Saints that had cost him, with them staring one another down as Femi got back to his feet. He clattered his challenger with a lariat, delivering the finishing powerbomb for the winning pinfall.\n\nAfter the match, Femi walked off with his title, confirming that it will be him going into this weekend's Saturday Night's Main Event against WWE Champion, Cody Rhodes. He gave a disapproving look to Saints, who simply shrugged it off and continued to smile at Evans defeated in the ring as the show went off air.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "description": "Award season is here",
    "fullText": "Postseason accolades are starting to roll across the country and on Tuesday the SEC announced that six Tigers were named to the All-Conference team as chosen by the league’s coaches.\n\nMansoor Delane and AJ Haulcy headline this year’s group, with both transfer DBs being named First-Team All-SEC. Sophomore tight end Trey’Dez Green was named to the second-team, while Harold Perkins, Damian Ramos, and Grant Chadwick all landed on the third-team.\n\nThis will be hopefully the first of many honors for Delane, who was named a finalist for the Thorpe Award. An All-American selection certainly appears to be in his future as well. Delane led the conference in passes defensed (13) and passes broken up (11), and per LSU he only allowed 13 receptions in 357 total pass coverage snaps.\n\nHaulcy gave LSU its best play at the safety position since Grant Delpit wore the purple and gold. Haulcy actually led the conference in tackles with 88 and also grabbed three interceptions this season.\n\nIf there was any type of bright spot for LSU’s anemic offense in 2025, it came in the form of Trey’Dez Green who had 29 receptions for 353 yards and a team-leading three touchdowns.\n\nConsidering Harold Perkins came into 2025 coming off an ACL tear, he had an excellent final season in Baton Rouge. Perkins had 56 tackles, led the Tigers with four sacks and tied for the team lead with eight TFLs. He also intercepted three passes and was credited with seven quarterback hurries. Perkins is no stranger to All-SEC honors, as he was voted Second-Team All-Conference in both 2o22 and 2023.\n\nYou may not realize it, but Damian Ramos is going to leave LSU as the most productive kicker in program history. Ramos broke the career field goal and scoring records this season, with 69 makes (nice……) and 404 points heading into the Texas Bowl. Ramos led the SEC this year with 24 field goals.\n\nGrant Chadwick quietly had one of the best punting seasons in school history. His 45.8 yards per punt was second best in the SEC this season and also the second-best in LSU history. Of his 54 punts this season, 21 went over 50 yards, and 18 of them were downed inside the 20. We all are hoping Lane Kiffin’s offense means we won’t see too much of Chadwick for the next couple of seasons, but if Kiffin does have to punt the ball away at least he’s got one of the best punters in the conference on his roster.",

They were also shut out 2-0 by the Washington Capitals' Logan Thompson on Dec. 7 at Capital One Arena before coming to Raleigh to take their usual pounding from the Hurricanes.\n\nThe Blue Jackets, who will start a four-game homestand Dec. 11 against the Ottawa Senators, are stuck in last place of the Metropolitan Division and have a -11 goal differential that's also worst in their division. They're now 7-8-3 in road games and just 2-6-2 against division opponents.\n\nBlue Jackets reporter Brian Hedger can be reached at bhedger@dispatch.com and @BrianHedger.bsky.social\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Columbus Dispatch: Hurricanes finish strong to deal Blue Jackets a third straight loss",

    "description": "Implant could restore lost senses, provide sensory feedback for prosthetic limbs",
    "fullText": "In a new leap for neurobiology and bioelectronics, Northwestern University scientists have developed a wireless device that uses light to send information directly to the brain — bypassing the body’s natural sensory pathways.\n\nThe soft, flexible device sits under the scalp but on top of the skull, where it delivers precise patterns of light through the bone to activate neurons across the cortex.\n\nIn experiments, scientists used the device’s tiny, patterned bursts of light to activate specific populations of neurons deep inside the brains of mouse models. (These neurons are genetically modified to respond to light.) The mice quickly learned to interpret these patterns as meaningful signals, which they could recognize and use. Even without touch, sight or sound involved, the animals received information to make decisions and successfully completed behavioral tasks.\n\nThe technology has immense potential for various therapeutic applications, including providing sensory feedback for prosthetic limbs, delivering artificial stimuli for future vision or hearing prostheses, modulating pain perception without opioids or systemic drugs, enhancing rehabilitation after stroke or injury, controlling robotic limbs with the brain and more.\n\nThe study will be published in the journal Nature Neuroscience.\n\n“Our brains are constantly turning electrical activity into experiences, and this technology gives us a way to tap into that process directly,” said Northwestern neurobiologist Yevgenia Kozorovitskiy, who led the experimental work. “This platform lets us create entirely new signals and see how the brain learns to use them. It brings us just a little bit closer to restoring lost senses after injuries or disease while offering a window into the basic principles that allow us to perceive the world.\n\n“Developing this device required rethinking how to deliver patterned stimulation to the brain in a format that is both minimally invasive and fully implantable,” said Northwestern bioelectronics pioneer John A. Rogers, who led the technology development. “By integrating a soft, conformable array of micro-LEDs — each as small as a single strand of human hair — with a wirelessly powered control module, we created a system that can be programmed in real time while remaining completely beneath the skin, without any measurable effect on natural behaviors of the animals. It represents a significant step forward in building devices that can interface with the brain without the need for burdensome wires or bulky external hardware. It’s valuable both in the immediate term for basic neuroscience research and in the longer term for addressing health challenges in humans.”\n\nKozorovitskiy is the Irving M. Klotz Professor of Neurobiology in Northwestern’s Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences. She also is a member of the Chemistry of Life Processes Institute. Rogers is the Louis Simpson and Kimberly Querrey Professor of Materials Science and Engineering, Biomedical Engineering and Neurological Surgery in the McCormick School of Engineering and Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. He also is the director of the Querrey Simpson Institute for Bioelectronics. Mingzheng Wu, a postdoctoral fellow in the Rogers and Kozorovitskiy laboratories, is the study’s first author.\n\nThe new study builds off previous work, in which Kozorovitskiy and Rogers introduced the first fully implantable, programmable, wireless, battery-free device capable of controlling neurons with light. Published in Nature Neuroscience in 2021, the previous study used a single micro-LED probe to influence social behavior in mice. While previous optogenetics (a method for controlling neurons with light) research required fiberoptic wires, which restrained mice, the wireless version allowed the animals to look and behave normally in social settings.\n\nThe new iteration takes this research a step further by enabling richer, more flexible communication with the brain. Going beyond the ability to activate and deactivate a single region of neurons, the new device features a programmable array of up to 64 micro-LEDs. With real-time control over each LED, researchers can send complex sequences to the brain that may resemble the distributed activity that occurs during natural sensations. Because real sensory experiences activate distributed cortical networks — not tiny, localized groups of neurons — the multi-region design mimics more natural patterns of brain activity.\n\n“In the first paper, we used a single micro-LED,” Wu said. “Now we’re using an array of 64 micro-LEDs to control the pattern of cortical activity. The number of patterns we can generate with various combinations of LEDs — frequency, intensity and temporal sequence — is nearly infinite.”\n\nRoughly the size of a postage stamp and thinner than a credit card, the new device also is less invasive. Instead of extending into the brain through a tiny cranial defect, the new soft, flexible device conforms to the surface of the skull and shines light through the bone.\n\n“Red light penetrates tissues quite well,” Kozorovitskiy said. “It reaches deep enough to activate neurons through the skull.”\n\nTo test the system, the team used mice engineered to have light-responsive cortical neurons. Then, they trained the mice to associate a particular pattern of brain stimulation with a reward. Typically, this task involved visiting a specific port in a chamber.\n\nIn a series of trials, the implant delivered a specific pattern across four cortical regions — like tapping a code directly onto neural circuits. The mice quickly learned to recognize this target pattern among dozens of alternatives. Using artificial signals carried by the target pattern, they chose the correct port to receive a reward.\n\n“By consistently selecting the correct port, the animal showed that it received the message,” Wu said. “They can’t use language to tell us what they sense, so they communicate through their behavior.”\n\nNow that the team has shown the brain can interpret patterned stimulation as meaningful signals, they plan to test more complex patterns and explore how many distinct patterns the brain can learn. Future iterations might include more LEDs, narrower spacing between LEDs, larger arrays covering more of the cortex and wavelengths of light that penetrate deeper into the brain.\n\nThe study was supported by the Querrey Simpson Institute of Bioelectronics, NINDS/BRAIN Initiative, National Institute of Mental Health, One Mind Nick LeDeit Rising Star Research Award, Kavli Exploration Award, Shaw Family Pioneer Award, Simons Foundation, Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and Christina Enroth-Cugell and David Cugell Fellowship.",

    "title": "The iFixit App Is Here",
    "description": "Wait, iFixit seriously didn’t have an app until 2025? Well, not since we got kicked out of the App Store. But we’re back, baby.",
    "fullText": "We’ve got big news: Today, you can download the iFixit app from the App Store and Google Play Store. All the repair guides you know and love, streamlined for mobile. A workbench that keeps track of your repairs. And some awesome app-only features, including a battery lifespan predictor and voice control with our brand-new AI repair buddy, FixBot.\n\nWait, iFixit seriously didn’t have an app until 2025? Well, not quite. We actually first launched an app back in 2011. But then, in 2015, we tore down a developer unit Apple TV and got kicked out of the App Store.\n\nSince then, we’ve been app-less. Our community, though, has kept asking for more mobile-native goodness. We’ve heard you, and we’re proud to finally share what we’ve been working on.\n\nNow, we’re back, baby. And better than ever.\n\nWe own more stuff than any generation in history, yet we know how to fix less of it. The diversity of what we own has outpaced our ability to learn how to fix it. Smart thermostats. E-bikes. Robot vacuums. Air fryers with WiFi. New products are hitting the market faster than ever.\n\nWhenever I fix something, I think about my grandfather. If something broke around the house, we called him. He’s the one who taught me to crack open a broken tube stereo instead of being afraid of it. His dad taught him on his hay farm; he taught me. That knowledge accumulated across generations because the fundamentals stayed stable long enough to pass down. But grandpa never saw a Nintendo Switch. Nobody’s grandmother knows how to fix a robot vacuum. We’re the first generation that has to figure most of this out alone.\n\nFortunately, more repair information is becoming available every day. Right to Repair laws are finally forcing manufacturers to share service manuals. iFixit and YouTube tutorials exist for everything. But Google has become a wasteland of AI-generated spam and affiliate marketing clickbait. We’ve all lived through the exhaustion of scrubbing through seven YouTube videos, each promising an “easy fix,” hunting for the one that actually shows the right screw.\n\nYet repair has never been more necessary. Life has gotten expensive. When an $800 phone breaks, that’s a month of groceries. We need to fix our stuff, and we can’t afford to waste hours hunting for answers. That’s where the iFixit app comes in: your trusted filter through the noise. Human-verified guides. Community-tested solutions. The wisdom of millions of successful repairs, distilled into one voice you can actually trust.\n\nSo what’s in the app? Well, it’s an app for your phone, so let’s start there. We built a complete toolkit for maintaining your phone, from tracking battery wear to more intensive fixes.\n\nYour phone doesn’t warn you that the battery is wearing out. It just gets worse and worse until one day you realize you’re tethered to a charger and your phone starts shutting down at 20%. This drives me crazy. I don’t understand why manufacturers don’t tell you when to expect to perform maintenance. Your car tells you when to change the oil!\n\nSo we built a tool that monitors your battery’s actual capacity in real time. Instead of abrupt shifts from “good” to “service needed,” we made some simple graphs plotting how your battery is wearing down. The app tells you months in advance when your battery will need replacing, so you can plan the repair on your schedule instead of scrambling when your phone dies at the airport.\n\nThis beta feature is a work in progress, because every phone reports its battery data a little differently. Apple doesn’t make the data available directly via an API, but allows access through an analytics file. Samsung makes it hard to get data on batteries that aren’t calibrated with secret software in their authorized service centers. But we’ve been able to pull together something that is useful in most situations. Give it a try and let us know your experience, and we’ll keep improving the accuracy as we go.\n\nFixBot: Your AI Repair Companion\n\nGrandpa isn’t around anymore, and I miss having someone to ask when I’m puzzled by a repair problem. FixBot is like having a patient repair expert on speed dial. Describe your problem by voice or text and it’ll walk you through diagnosis and repair, adapting to what you’re actually seeing. We gave FixBot a voice because it’s hard to use a device while you’re turning a screw. My hands are often covered in some kind of grease that I don’t want on my screen. And unlike generic AI, FixBot is trained on millions of successful iFixit community repairs, not internet averages and clickbait.\n\nWe’ve spent two years pouring everything we know about repair into FixBot, and we’re really thrilled with the result. I wrote more about what FixBot can do over here.\n\nLast week, my two year old decided my Pixel 7 Pro was a football and cracked the screen. The app knows what phone I have, and immediately routes me to the part and guide I need. No more paging through Google or fumbling with browser tabs mid-repair. Our goal was to streamline the process: Figure out what the fix will take, find the right part, and follow the guide to install it. Open the app and get to work.\n\nOf course, the app includes all of iFixit at your fingertips. Thousands of step-by-step guides, with photos at every stage. Save your devices to the app and skip the endless hunt for model numbers. Your stuff is right there when you need it. Search actually works: type “screen flickering” and get real answers, not SEO noise. Professional-grade documentation, built for first-timers.\n\nThere’s nothing worse than finishing a repair and having a low quality part let you down. I’ve suffered through shoddy parts from Amazon too many times, and I’m over it. We only sell parts I’d use myself. The app checks compatibility before you order, so you’re not returning the wrong battery for the third time. Tools are high quality and hand curated. When you know what you need, ordering is fast.\n\nWe had a ceiling fan that would only kick on if you banged the wall. Grandpa laughed and called it a poltergeist. I was intimidated to try fixing it myself. What if I made it worse?\n\nHelping him rewire that fan helped me realize how capable I really was. I flipped the switch, the ceiling fan started working again, and I thought: I can’t believe I did that. Now, I teach other people to fix things they never thought they could. The second repair is always easier. By the third, they start looking around their house differently. What else can I fix?\n\nThis is the confidence cascade, and it changes how you see yourself. You stop being a consumer who passively buys and abandons. You become a maintainer. An owner. You take care of your stuff instead of being at its mercy. Fixing things is the antidote to learned helplessness. Every successful repair is proof that you’re not dependent on the next available technician, on some company that would rather you just buy a new one.\n\nWe live in an era of planned obsolescence. Companies want you renting, not owning. The iFixit community has been pushing back against that. We’re a bunch of regular folks proving to ourselves, one repair at a time, that regular people can take care of their own stuff.\n\nThat’s the movement you’re joining. Repair is power. Your things belong to you. Being able to fix your own stuff is a skill worth having.\n\nAnd right now? It’s a skill we can’t afford not to have. Life has gotten expensive. Wages haven’t kept up. Your phone breaking shouldn’t mean choosing between a replacement and rent. Learning to fix what you own is incredibly satisfying. The iFixit app is a grandfather in your pocket: patient, knowledgeable, and ready to help you figure it out.\n\nThe iFixit app is in both Google Play and, rather shockingly, Apple’s App Store. Get it while it’s hot.\n\nThis is just the beginning: let us know what you think and what we should add next over on iFixit Meta.",

    "description": "Former Disney dealmaker Kevin Mayer predicts \"more fireworks\" in the bidding war for Warner Bros. between Netflix and Paramount.",
    "fullText": "A former Disney executive who oversaw its dealmaking expects \"more fireworks\" in the bidding war for Warner Bros.\n\n\"I would be very surprised if we don't see a sweetened, and perhaps meaningfully sweetened, offer\" from Netflix, Paramount Skydance, or both, said Kevin Mayer, Disney's former top dealmaker, on Tuesday at the UBS media conference.\n\nOn Friday, Netflix agreed to buy Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studio assets for $82.7 billion, including debt. Paramount Skydance then launched a hostile offer, saying on Monday that it's willing to pay $108.4 billion for the whole firm, including the TV networks like CNN and HGTV. Executives at Netflix and Paramount CEO David Ellison have each framed their offers as the best for employees, Hollywood, WBD shareholders, and TV viewers. Both suitors also said they're confident they can pass regulatory scrutiny.\n\nMayer, now the co-CEO of Cocomelon owner Candle Media, said he thinks Paramount's hostile bid will reignite the faceoff for Warner Bros. and force the eventual winner to fork over more money.\n\n\"From the Warner Bros. Discovery perspective, this is nothing but good news,\" Mayer said.\n\nMayer added: \"Does it move up another $5 billion or $10 billion? I think it probably does. That's what it's going to take to win it.\"\n\nMayer said the battle for Warner Bros. reminds him of the fight for control of 21st Century Fox between Disney and Comcast, which he was involved in during his tenure at the Mouse House.\n\nUnder Mayer, Disney agreed to buy Fox's studio, FX, and its stake in Hulu for $52.4 billion in equity, or $66.1 billion with debt, in December 2017. Six months later, cable giant Comcast made a $65 billion all-cash offer for those same assets. Disney ultimately won, but it was forced to pay a heftier price of $71.3 billion. Mayer helped engineer Disney's initial agreement with Fox, but had moved to a role atop Disney's streaming business by the time the acquisition closed.\n\n\"That was a difficult process,\" Mayer said of Comcast's bid for Fox. \"It added $19 billion to the price tag. Still a good deal, but not the exceptional deal that it was before we had to pay more.\"\n\nWhile Disney's deal with Fox gave it control over Hulu and bolstered its library, Disney activist investor Nelson Peltz argued that the Mouse House had shown \"poor judgment\" by \"overpaying for the 21st Century Fox assets.\"\n\nAs Netflix and Paramount vie for Warner Bros., Mayer said the Disney-Comcast showdown \"points to where we might see this going.\"\n\nThat's because Ellison's $30-per-share hostile bid, which Paramount also sent to WBD's board, might not be rich enough, Mayer said.\n\n\"David Ellison has already kind of hinted at that, that he hasn't done his best and final yet, and I suspect he hasn't,\" Mayer said.\n\nMayer was likely referencing a text message from Ellison to WBD CEO David Zaslav, which was made public as part of a Paramount filing on Monday: \"Please note importantly we did not include 'best and final' in our bid.\"\n\n\"The team at Paramount is aggressive,\" Mayer said. He pointed to the gargantuan amount of money that David Ellison and his father, Oracle billionaire Larry, have at their disposal.\n\n\"I don't think there's a whole lot of hesitancy to spend it,\" Mayer said.",

But even failures can have a silver lining.\n\nThe billionaire British inventor helped reshape what people expect from home appliances, particularly the modern vacuum cleaner. His company's history is one of overcoming failures and rejections to create successful products.\n\nHowever, some of Dyson's visions never got past the prototype phase. In 2014, the company decided that it would work on building an electric car since it already manufactured electric motors for its existing products. By 2019, though, the project was scrapped, as it was \"no-longer commercially viable,\" Dyson wrote in a 2020 blog post.\n\n\"Everybody said, 'You know, you must have learned a lot from that experience,' and the answer is I learned absolutely nothing,\" Dyson told podcast host David Senra in a Monday episode of his show.\n\nDyson spent about $750 million on research and development for its electric car. Then came the 2016 \"Dieselgate\" scandal in which Volkswagen was called out for misleading \"clean diesel\" ads, triggering billions in fines and reshaping the global auto industry. As automotive companies jumped into making EVs, Dyson said they became more expensive to produce.\n\nIt was \"fun to do,\" Dyson said, and it produced one model in its Singapore office and a somewhat drivable prototype in one of the company's hangars.\n\n\"It was a difficult decision to stop, because hundreds of engineers, scientists and designers, had poured everything into the project and it was a great engineering achievement,\" Dyson said in the blog post.\n\nHowever, the company said it simply couldn't afford to invest the money into overcoming the \"huge disadvantages\" that come along with only manufacturing EVs. He pointed to one competitor that had the funds to do so, and it's still around today.\n\n\"Tesla overcame that through sheer scale and might and investment, but we didn't have that sort of money,\" Dyson said on the podcast. \"We couldn't take that sort of risk, so we stopped it.\"\n\n\"Sadly, we didn't really learn anything from it,\" Dyson said.\n\nBuilding an EV isn't an easy undertaking even for companies that have billions to pour into research and development. In 2024, Apple reportedly decided to sunset its electric car project after pushing back the car's launch date to 2028 amid production challenges.\n\nDyson has previously said that he doesn't regret pursuing an EV even if nothing came of it. It brought in talented engineers, and while half the people who worked on the project ended up leaving for other manufacturers, the other half were put back to work on vacuum cleaners, Dyson said.\n\nA Dyson spokesperson told Business Insider that the inventor believes \"passionately in the importance of failure.\"\n\n\"The project brought a significant influx of talented engineers and scientists into Dyson, and those engineers have contributed to many successes across Dyson's R&D, with their expertise strengthening Dyson's innovation in multiple areas,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nAlthough Dyson said he doesn't test drive the prototype anymore, there is one scrapped project that remains close to Dyson's heart — or at least useful in his day-to-day life.\n\nThe Dyson CR01 Contrarotator is a washing machine that was discontinued in 2005 after it failed to gain traction with a $1,300 price tag that dwarfed that of the competition. However, Dyson said he still uses his.\n\n\"I use them,\" Dyson said. \"It's great, and people have now copied a lot of the ideas, like the big door.\"",

    "description": "I thought it would be hard to keep the Christmas spirit alive  in my interfaith family when my kids outgrew Santa. Then I found a new tradition.",
    "fullText": "\"Don't come into the attic, I'm wrapping Christmas gifts,\" I shouted to my youngest child last December, awaiting her response. She'd recently turned 11, and in my heart, I knew she no longer believed in Santa.\n\n\"Mom! Don't forget, I want Monopoly,\" she casually called back.\n\nI scrunched my eyelids together, holding back hot tears. Santa, the only arbiter of Christmas gifts in our household, was also the magic link to my Italian Catholic childhood for me and for my Jewish children, whom I'm raising in my husband's faith.\n\nEven though my kids go to synagogue and have been bar and bat mitzvah'd, it was important to me that they celebrate my Christmas traditions with my family, and Santa has always been an integral part of the holiday.\n\nBut now, my worst fear was confirmed. Without having to ask her, my daughter communicated that she realized St. Nick didn't exist in her world any more. I was left to wonder how our family would keep the holiday sparkle, my Christmas tradition, alive if Santa's magic had been put to rest.\n\nSure, Christmas would be easier now that my baby was wiser, but a dull ache still enveloped my heart. Knowing I was turning 50 in early December added to my melancholy.\n\nPart of the reason why I continued the Kris Kringle tradition was that watching my children blissfully tear open presents reminded me of my own childhood excitement, which was especially high the year I turned 8, when a brand-new tape recorder and microphone gleamed under the tree. I remember that magic, and wanted my children to keep feeling it, too.\n\nNow that Santa had vanished from our Christmas celebrations, I felt like I was left with a meaningless pile of boxes to wrap, a slog without his enchantment. I wished for a \"Back to the Future\" moment, one where I'd revisit my childhood for just one day.\n\nInstead, my night sweats, coupled with the shock that my face (amongst other body parts) was inching downward, caused me to wonder, \"Am I closer to where I'm going than where I came from? Will my children channel Santa when I'm gone?\" I'll admit, it was all very dramatic.\n\nAs the first week of December approached, I flipped through a childhood photo album, hoping, once again, to relive my youth. There, I saw a picture of myself with the recorder and microphone that I remembered so fondly. That's when my inner child whispered, \"karaoke,\" as I looked into an imaginary spotlight, and I made jazz hands.\n\nLater that month, I rang in my 50th birthday with friends at Baby Grand, a karaoke bar in New York City. High on the vocal vibrations of the night, I Amazon-primed a karaoke machine to my house as a birthday gift and pondered my annual Christmas Eve gala. I thought singing might make it a more cheerful occasion now that Santa wouldn't be getting the spotlight.\n\n\"I'm serving seven fishes, but not gefilte,\" I joked, as I invited my extended Jewish relatives to join our Italian festa, something I'd never done before. I hoped my cousins wouldn't be offended that I'd turned our annual Christmas gathering into a Broadway-like musical. I also worried that my three kids, aged 11 to 19 at the time, would be so embarrassed they'd refuse to participate.\n\nThat night, I tossed my hair like Janice Joplin and belted out, \"Busted down in Baton Rouge,\" a line from one of my favorite tunes. The crowd was quiet, so I opened my eyes and took a breath. Then, everyone woo-hoo'd as I crooned the rest of \"Me and Bobby McGee\" and bowed. Then my cousin and his fiancée started \"Sweet Caroline.\"\n\nMy kids' beaming smiles radiated joy, not embarrassment. For a moment, while they clapped and we harmonized together singing the line, \"Good times never felt so good,\" I was a kid again, and the Santa vibes surrounded us as a new tradition was born.\n\nThis year, I'll bust out the karaoke microphones again, lure my Dad to the stage with a little Frank Sinatra, and ply the Jewish side of the family with extra eggnog in hopes that they'll all indulge my new tradition again. I can't wait.",

    "description": "MIT researchers at the School of Architecture and Planning developed a speech-to-reality system that combines generative AI, natural language processing, and robotic assembly to fabricate physical objects from spoken prompts.",
    "fullText": "Generative AI and robotics are moving us ever closer to the day when we can ask for an object and have it created within a few minutes. In fact, MIT researchers have developed a speech-to-reality system, an AI-driven workflow that allows them to provide input to a robotic arm and “speak objects into existence,” creating things like furniture in as little as five minutes.\n\nWith the speech-to-reality system, a robotic arm mounted on a table is able to receive spoken input from a human, such as “I want a simple stool,” and then construct the objects out of modular components. To date, the researchers have used the system to create stools, shelves, chairs, a small table, and even decorative items such as a dog statue.\n\n“We’re connecting natural language processing, 3D generative AI, and robotic assembly,” says Alexander Htet Kyaw, an MIT graduate student and Morningside Academy for Design (MAD) fellow. “These are rapidly advancing areas of research that haven’t been brought together before in a way that you can actually make physical objects just from a simple speech prompt.”\n\nThe idea started when Kyaw — a graduate student in the departments of Architecture and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science — took Professor Neil Gershenfeld’s course, “How to Make Almost Anything.” In that class, he built the speech-to-reality system. He continued working on the project at the MIT Center for Bits and Atoms (CBA), directed by Gershenfeld, collaborating with graduate students Se Hwan Jeon of the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Miana Smith of CBA.\n\nThe speech-to-reality system begins with speech recognition that processes the user’s request using a large language model, followed by 3D generative AI that creates a digital mesh representation of the object, and a voxelization algorithm that breaks down the 3D mesh into assembly components.\n\nAfter that, geometric processing modifies the AI-generated assembly to account for fabrication and physical constraints associated with the real world, such as the number of components, overhangs, and connectivity of the geometry. This is followed by creation of a feasible assembly sequence and automated path planning for the robotic arm to assemble physical objects from user prompts.\n\n“This project is an interface between humans, AI, and robots to co-create the world around us,” Kyaw says. “Imagine a scenario where you say ‘I want a chair,’ and within five minutes a physical chair materializes in front of you.”\n\nThe team has immediate plans to improve the weight-bearing capability of the furniture by changing the means of connecting the cubes from magnets to more robust connections.\n\n“We’ve also developed pipelines for converting voxel structures into feasible assembly sequences for small, distributed mobile robots, which could help translate this work to structures at any size scale,” Smith says.\n\nThe purpose of using modular components is to eliminate the waste that goes into making physical objects by disassembling and then reassembling them into something different, for instance turning a sofa into a bed when you no longer need the sofa.\n\nBecause Kyaw also has experience using gesture recognition and augmented reality to interact with robots in the fabrication process, he is currently working on incorporating both speech and gestural control into the speech-to-reality system.\n\nLeaning into his memories of the replicator in the “Star Trek” franchise and the robots in the animated film “Big Hero 6,” Kyaw explains his vision.\n\n“I want to increase access for people to make physical objects in a fast, accessible, and sustainable manner,” he says. “I’m working toward a future where the very essence of matter is truly in your control. One where reality can be generated on demand.”\n\nThe team presented their paper “Speech to Reality: On-Demand Production using Natural Language, 3D Generative AI, and Discrete Robotic Assembly” at the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Symposium on Computational Fabrication (SCF ’25) held at MIT on Nov. 21.",

    "description": "Paul Thomas Anderson's movie \"One Battle After Another\" has a thrilling car-chase scene that was filmed on location in California.",
    "fullText": "\"One Battle After Another\" production designer Florencia Martin was driving near the California-Arizona border with director Paul Thomas Anderson on a location scout when they came across a unique stretch of road.\n\nAfter miles and miles of flat roadway cut through the middle of the desert, the topography was suddenly rocky, and the road's dips became so dramatic that they looked like big concrete waves stretching as far as the eye could see.\n\n\"Paul took out his phone and started recording out the car window,\" Martin told Business Insider.\n\nNo one in the car knew it yet, but they'd just found the thrilling ending to their movie.\n\nAnderson's latest epic, which stars Leonardo DiCaprio as an ex-revolutionary who is forced back into the cause to save his daughter Willa (Chase Infiniti) from a deranged military officer (Sean Penn), ends with a tense car-chase scene in which the contours of the road play a key role.\n\nThat only happened because of a stroke of luck. The movie's location manager, Michael Glaser, had taken Martin and Anderson on a three-hour drive from Los Angeles to Blythe, California, to scout a spot for the revolutionaries' camp. On the ride back to LA, they took a different route — one that sent them through a stretch of road outside Borrego Springs, California, that locals call \"The Texas Dip\" for the enormity of its drops.\n\nSoon after that trip, Martin received a new version of the script from Anderson in which the car chase scene ended on \"The Texas Dip.\"\n\nThe thrilling sequence, in which Infiniti's Willa outsmarts an assassin using the road's hills and the angle of the sun, wasn't easy to shoot. The team had scouted the location in the winter, but shot the scene in the summer, so they had to adjust their shooting schedule based on the sun's direction on the road at that time of year. And then there was the unforgiving environment.\n\n\"It was 110 degrees, people had heat exhaustion, there was wind, the dirt would get into the camera and jam it,\" said Martin, whose credits include 2022's \"Babylon\" and Anderson's 2021 movie \"Licorice Pizza.\" \"It was the harshest conditions you could imagine.\"\n\nIt was all worth it once Martin saw the car chase sequence for the first time with an audience.\n\n\"People actually gasped when watching it,\" she said. \"What's special about the way Paul works and being in these locations is you feel it on screen, the dirt on Willa's face, feeling the heat come off the road.\"\n\nMartin still can't believe the sequence is being compared to classic car-chase scenes in movie history.\n\n\"The fact that our movie is compared to movies we've watched like \"The French Connection\" and \"Vanishing Point,\" that are iconic, it's a huge honor,\" she said.\n\n\"One Battle After Another\" is now playing in theaters.",

    "description": "Tapestry, the parent company of Coach, is applying its Gen Z \"road map\" to Kate Spade as it looks to boost the brand.",
    "fullText": "Gen Z is carrying Coach — literally and figuratively.\n\nThat demographic of shoppers, born between 1997 and 2012, is the \"center of the bull's-eye\" for the luxury handbag brand, according to Scott Roe, CFO and COO of Coach's parent company Tapestry.\n\nNow, Tapestry wants to replicate the success it has had with Coach for Kate Spade, which it acquired in 2017.\n\nRoe talked at length about Tapestry's focus on Gen Z during an upcoming episode of Monica Langley's \"Office Hours: Business Edition\" podcast, set to release on Wednesday. Business Insider got an exclusive look at the episode's transcript.\n\nCoach zeroed in on Gen Z out of necessity. Roe told Langley that the company was looking at data, which estimated that, by 2030, about 70% of handbag purchases were going to be made by either Gen Z or millennial buyers. But the average age of Coach buyers was 40, he said.\n\n\"We said, well, that's a problem,\" Roe recounted. \"We got to get younger.\"\n\nDuring Tapestry's November earnings call, CEO Joanne Crevoiserat told investors that Coach had acquired 1.7 million new customers in its most recent quarter, driven by Gen Z. Tapestry also reported revenue of $1.7 billion for the quarter, an increase of 13% year-over-year.\n\nJust like Coach, Kate Spade is \"targeting\" Gen Z, Roe said.\n\n\"We like 18 years as a point of entry. That's when a young lady goes from upper school or high school into college,\" Roe said. \"They typically go from a backpack to a bag.\"\n\nFirst on Tapestry's \"road map\" to bring Kate Spade into the zeitgeist is getting young buyers to \"be aware that Kate Spade exists,\" Roe said, which means increasing marketing spend on the brand.\n\nOne example of a buzzy product that Kate Spade is pushing is its Duo Crossbody Bag, which Roe said is \"already a big bag\" and expects it to be a hit over the holidays.\n\nSocial media, such as videos on YouTube or posts on Reddit, play a role in getting Gen Z to \"consider whether they want to buy the brand,\" Roe said. (He didn't go into detail on Tapestry's strategy of paid social media partnerships with creators, however.)\n\nSome members of the younger Gen Z cohort have more spending power than meets the eye, Roe said.\n\n\"They have six wallets, right? Two grandparents and their parents,\" Roe said.\n\nGoing after Gen Z doesn't come without hurdles, however.\n\n\"As we thought about how we become more relevant to that younger generation, we were also faced with some dilemmas,\" Roe said.\n\nThe biggest obstacle: Gen Z has an endless array of options when it comes to shopping.\n\n\"Because there's so many more choices for them, it's more difficult to break through,\" Roe said.\n\nHow to break through? Marketing. And then more marketing.\n\nRoe said that Tapestry \"more than tripled\" its marketing spend. \"It's our intent to keep doing that.\"",

    "description": "Export-controlled technology worth US$30 million with fake brand labels was allegedly addressed to a facility near Toronto’s Pearson airport",
    "fullText": "A Chinese-born Canadian citizen who lives in Mississauga, Ont., was arrested in Virginia by the FBI and charged with trying to smuggle restricted high-tech Nvidia computer chips used in AI processing to China\n\nU.S. authorities seized export-controlled technology worth about $30 million that was addressed to an air freight facility in Mississauga, close to Toronto Pearson International Airport, according to allegations filed in court.\n\nNvidia labels on the components had been removed and replaced with labels for a fake company, authorities said.\n\nThe arrest of Benlin Yuan, of Mississauga, immediately west of Toronto, and the large shipment destined for Toronto are part of Operation Gatekeeper, described by U.S. authorities as targeting “a sophisticated illicit procurement conspiracy and smuggling network that orchestrates buying and exporting controlled high-tech computer chips to China.”\n\nYuan is described in U.S. prosecution documents as president of an information technology company based in Virginia that provides data centre services and IT support and consulting in Canada and the United States. The documents say it is a subsidiary of a Chinese company based in Beijing.\n\nHe was arrested in Sterling, Virginia, on Nov. 28 and charged with conspiring to violate export control acts.\n\nThe network is accused of purchasing at least US$50 million worth of GPUs from a large U.S. technology company.\n\nThe computer products Yuan is alleged to be involved in exporting are Nvidia A100, H100, and H200 Tensor Core graphic processing units, known as GPUs, and HGX baseboards. The equipment is used in artificial intelligence (AI) applications and in high-performance computing. The chips can handle huge amounts of data that is needed in AI applications, an exploding field that is revolutionizing technology.\n\nThe GPUs can perform calculations at higher speeds than most previous computers.\n\nSince about November 2023, a Chinese company has worked to import these chips from the United States, prosecutors allege. The entire plot is alleged to have involved US$160 million in tech goods.\n\nYuan is accused of joining the conspiracy this spring.\n\nIn a criminal complaint sworn by a special agent in the U.S. Department of Commerce, Yuan helped buy the technology using straw purchasers and intermediaries, meaning in the name of a person or company that is not the real end buyer.\n\nThe buyers allegedly declared the goods were for use by customers within the United States or in countries that do not require an export licence, including Taiwan and Thailand.\n\nAt various U.S. warehouses, Nvidia labels were allegedly removed from the computer circuits and relabeled with a fake manufacturing brand of SANDKYAN, according to the criminal complaint against Yuan.\n\nWhen preparing the items for export, the shipping paperwork misclassified the products as harmless and unrestricted pieces of tech: “adapters,” “adapter modules,” and “computer controllers,” authorities claim.\n\nThey were then shipped, directly or indirectly, to China.\n\nInvestigators received a tip about pallets of suspicious GPUs at a New Jersey warehouse that were addressed to companies in China.\n\nAn undercover agent was sent inside, where he spent an hour.\n\nThe agent allegedly saw two engineers who appeared to be of Chinese origin unboxing Nvidia components. One of the engineers spoke to the undercover agent in Mandarin, documents say. The engineers said they had to cover up all of the Nvidia branding on the equipment for “export purposes,” court filings allege.\n\nThe agent watched Nvidia labels being pulled off and new ones for the fake firm put in their place. The next day the agent returned and found the boxes had been resealed. The products were now labeled as having been “Made in Taiwan.”\n\nNot only were those packages addressed for shipping to Toronto, but warehouse employees told agents they recently had several similar tech exports to Canada.\n\nThe packages were removed and secured in a government warehouse. That sparked a flow of complaint calls and demand letters about the missing GPUs. The people expecting the goods believed the undercover officer had stolen the products and started negotiating to have them returned, authorities allege.\n\nThey offered $1 million to get their packages back, but insisted the equipment be inspected before payment was made.\n\nYuan is accused of organizing the “inspection.”\n\nHe is accused of recruiting and arranging the group of inspectors and of being one of the six who arrived to examine the packages, about two weeks after the seizure, court filings allege.\n\nThe inspection arrangements were allegedly planned in a group chat using an encrypted communication app and confirmed later over a video conferencing app.\n\nYuan was told by a high-level representative of the buyer in China to make sure no one said the items were destined for China, according to the criminal complaint. He is accused of helping them develop an elaborate “compliance backstory” to justify the products based on false information.\n\nThey also allegedly discussed how to make the million-dollar payment and Yuan was told to send copies of the driver’s licences of everyone on the inspection team. Three trucks were arranged for the pick up.\n\nHe is also accused of handling the storage of a different shipment of Nvidia products destined for China. A cooperating witness for U.S. prosecutors alleged that Yuan told him not to put fake labels on this one as he thought they looked suspicious; he would rather the Nvidia labels just be removed.\n\nAlexander Blanchard, a Virginia-based lawyer for Yuan, declined to comment about Yuan or the case when asked by National Post.\n\n“Operation Gatekeeper has exposed a sophisticated smuggling network that threatens our nation’s security by funneling cutting-edge AI technology to those who would use it against American interests,” said Nicholas Ganjei, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Texas.\n\n“These chips are the building blocks of AI superiority and are integral to modern military applications. The country that controls these chips will control AI technology; the country that controls AI technology will control the future.”\n\nU.S. regulation restricts the export of items that could make a significant contribution to the military potential of other nations or could be detrimental to the foreign policy or national security of the United States.\n\nAdvanced computing integrated circuits, including certain Nvidia-manufactured GPUs were added to the export restriction list in 2022. Some of the latest Nvidia chips have been classed by the U.S. as “critical technologies” that China could use to “modernize its military capabilities in ways that threaten the national security interests of the United States and its allies,” according to export regulations.\n\nThe chips require a special licence to export to China.\n\nOn Monday, the same day Operation Gatekeeper was announced, U.S. President Donald Trump said the United States will allow Nvidia’s H200 processors to be exported to China with a 25 per cent fee.\n\nAlan Hao Hsu, also known as Haochun Hsu, 43, of Missouri City, Texas, and his company both pleaded guilty to smuggling and unlawful export activities in October as part of Operation Gatekeeper.\n\nNewly unsealed court documents say Hsu received more than US$50 million in wire transfers from China to help fund the scheme. He is scheduled for sentencing in February.\n\nFanyue Gong, also known as Tom Gong, 43, a citizen of China who lives in Brooklyn, New York, was also charged in the probe. He is described as the owner of a New York technology company. He was arrested in New York on Dec. 3, and charged with conspiring to smuggle goods out of the United States.\n\nFive unnamed co-conspirators are linked to IT companies based in Hong Kong or Shenzhen, a city on the Pearl River that acts as a bridge between Hong Kong and mainland China.\n\n• Email: ahumphreys@postmedia.com | X: AD_Humphreys\n\nOur website is the place for the latest breaking news, exclusive scoops, longreads and provocative commentary.

    "description": "A detailed technical overview of the ModelMatch system, built on a commercial-grade multi-dimensional video generation benchmark.",
    "fullText": "This is a technical overview of our upcoming ModelMatch feature, scheduled to be released alongside GMI Studios (coming soon!)\n\nTechnical Overview editor: Colin Mo, Head of Content at GMI Cloud\n\nWe present a commercial-grade, multi-dimensional evaluation pipeline leveraging GMI Cloud’s large-scale dataset and RAG annotation. The framework evaluates six key dimensions—aesthetic quality, background consistency, dynamic degree, imaging quality, motion smoothness, and subject consistency—producing both aggregate scores and detailed diagnostic insights.\n\nAs AI-generated video rapidly transforms advertising, entertainment, and social media, the real challenge for businesses is identifying which models deliver reliable, high-quality results at scale.\n\nVideo generation is moving into commercial applications, from content creation to personalized media. With access to a large-scale generated video dataset, GMI Cloud provides a unique platform to benchmark models under realistic, production-level conditions.\n\nEvaluating video generation remains challenging:\n\nOur goal is to build the first commercial-grade, multi-dimensional evaluation pipeline for AI video generation. This framework delivers robust, multi-aspect metrics and actionable insights, enabling model selection and customer-specific optimization.\n\nAll evaluations were conducted using GMI Cloud’s elastic GPU clusters and inference pipelines—the same infrastructure available to customers for real-time video AI deployment. This ensures that benchmark results directly reflect the performance businesses can achieve in production.\n\nThis benchmark provides tangible benefits across the AI video ecosystem:\n\nGMI Cloud provides next-generation AI infrastructure for builders, offering scalable GPU clusters, inference engines, and model evaluation pipelines. Our platform enables anyone to build, evaluate, and deploy AI at scale, removing technical barriers and accelerating commercial adoption.\n\nWe collected a large-scale dataset of generated videos along with their corresponding prompts from GMI Cloud. The dataset is representative of real-world generation scenarios, providing a solid foundation for evaluating model performance under practical conditions.\n\nWe annotated video samples using two AI-assisted tools: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and DeepSeek.\n\nTogether, these tools allow us to efficiently annotate large datasets while maintaining diverse coverage and reliable dimension-level evaluations, without needing to manually watch and score thousands of videos.\n\nTakeaway: This hybrid approach combines the strengths of reference-based retrieval (RAG) and direct video analysis (DeepSeek), giving us a scalable, automated way to annotate and evaluate generated video content.\n\nOur evaluation builds on VBench/F-Bench/VM-Bench, with extensions designed for commercial-scale video generation:\n\nWe assess video quality along six key dimensions:\n\nNote: using vllm(tarsier-7b) is also applicable, new benchmarks in ICCV 2025 coming soon.\n\nScoring and Aggregation Methodology\n\nWe evaluated 271 videos generated by five major model families on GMI Cloud infrastructure, scoring them across six key dimensions: background consistency, aesthetic quality, subject consistency, dynamic degree, imaging quality, and motion smoothness. Each dimension was normalized between 0–1 and weighted (dynamic degree=0.1, others=1.0) to produce an overall ranking that informs practical decision-making.\n\nTakeaway: Seedance-1-0-pro-250528 delivers peak performance for high-motion and technically demanding videos, while Veo3 offers a balanced, reliable choice for a broad range of applications.\n\nBreaking down performance by dimension highlights which models excel for specific business needs:\n\nTakeaway: Multi-dimensional evaluation reveals complementary strengths, guiding clients to choose models based on specific priorities—motion, stability, or overall polish.\n\nConsistent performance across diverse prompts is critical for production reliability and scalability:\n\nA correlation heatmap was generated across the six evaluation dimensions to examine interdependencies between metrics. Preliminary observations include:\n\nTakeaway: Addressing these limitations will enhance evaluation fidelity, alignment with human perception, and practical deployment, positioning this benchmark as a foundation for next-generation AI video tools.\n\nOur evaluation of 271 videos across five major model families reveals several practical insights for model selection:\n\nOverall Performance vs. Dimension-Specific Strengths\n\nPerformance Consistency Matters\n\nPerformance Patterns Across Dimensions\n\nModel Recommendations by Use Case\n\nTakeaway: Selecting the right model depends on specific business needs, and multi-dimensional evaluation enables task-driven, customer-specific recommendations.\n\nFuture iterations will incorporate human perceptual scoring, prompt-style diversity tests, and support for multiple new benchmarks presented at ICCV 2025, establishing a foundation for the world’s first end-to-end commercial Video AI Benchmark. This roadmap enables continuous improvements in model design, evaluation methodology, and business-tailored AI video solutions, while keeping GMI Cloud at the forefront of commercial video AI evaluation and deployment.",

    "title": "Airbus CEO said the future of commercial aviation could be a B-2 bomber-like plane with a cabin in the wing",
    "description": "A blended-wing body aircraft is essentially one giant wing with the cabin built inside. Two California companies are racing Airbus to market.",
    "fullText": "The future of aviation could look surprisingly similar to the triangular paper airplanes you folded as a kid.\n\nIn an interview with Tobias Fuchs and Martin Murphy at the German newspaper Bild, Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said that over the next 30 or 40 years, planemakers may abandon the traditional tube-and-wing layout for a single, thick wing with the passenger cabin built inside.\n\nThis design — known as a \"blended-wing body,\" or BWB — distributes lift across the entire sweeping wing, allowing for heavier carrying capacity and greater efficiency than conventional jets. Faury said a widebody aircraft would be \"better suited\" for the concept.\n\nHe added that the BWB benefits come with trade-offs, including the possibility of eliminating windows. Passengers wouldn't receive any natural light, and some could get disoriented or experience claustrophobia.\n\nEmergency evacuations could also be challenging: passengers and crew would have no view of what's going on outside, and those in the cabin center would be farther from exits than on today's jets.\n\nFaury's comments are the latest sign that Airbus sees opportunity in the blended-wing design, an area where it faces competition from new aircraft makers seeking to beat Airbus to market. The BWB design has a long history.\n\nThe Northrop B-2 Spirit stealth bomber — often cited as the best-known \"flying wing\" aircraft — first flew in 1989. Although the BWB concept dates back even further, renewed interest emerged in the early 1990s when McDonnell Douglas explored a blended-wing transport idea that eventually evolved into the BWB-17 in partnership with NASA.\n\nAfter McDonnell Douglas merged with Boeing in 1997, Boeing continued the work with NASA to produce the X-48 series of subscale demonstrators until the program ended in 2013.\n\nBut, to date, no full-size passenger BWB has been certified or flown, and Boeing has not announced plans to develop its own.\n\nFor its part, Airbus has been exploring BWBs since 2017, and the company's 200-person design is a key pillar of its ZEROe initiative for zero-emission aviation.\n\nIn 2019, the company flew a small-scale demonstrator that showed potential major fuel savings — estimated at around 20% — and new cabin layouts made possible by the wider interior. The long-term vision includes running these aircraft on hydrogen rather than traditional jet fuel.\n\nBut despite the early momentum, Airbus has pushed its initial ZEROe 2035 timeline by as much as 10 years.\n\nAirbus has cited challenges surrounding certification complexity, limited global hydrogen infrastructure, and uncertainty around passenger acceptance — especially when some seats could be positioned far from natural light.\n\nStill, the BWB race is far from just an Airbus effort.\n\nAviation startups like Natilus and JetZero are betting that the unconventional BWB shape could help crack the traditional Boeing-Airbus duopoly, with both targeting launches in the early 2030s.\n\nSan Diego-based Natilus is developing a narrowbody version called Horizon to rival the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737, promising about 25% lower fuel burn but 40% more cabin space. And it can fit into existing airport infrastructure.\n\nCompany CEO Aleksey Matyushev previously told Business Insider that the industry could face a shortfall of roughly 40,000 narrowbody jets over the next 20 years — a number he said is far more than the two legacy players can realistically supply.\n\nMatyushev added that Horizon's larger cabin footprint could allow for wider seats, dedicated family areas, and other special features that go beyond what today's narrowbody jets offer.\n\nRenderings of Horizon's proposed cabin, released in July, show up to three aisles instead of the traditional one or two. Matyushev confirmed to Business Insider that the jet will have windows throughout.\n\nPassengers in the center seats will still be farther from the windows, but Natilus said it is adding skylights and other lighting strategies to mimic the outside.\n\nMeanwhile, 100 miles north in Long Beach, JetZero is pursuing a widebody version called the \"Z4\" that promises up to 50% lower fuel burn and could replace jets like the Boeing 767 and Airbus A330.\n\nThe plane would have similar advantages to Horizon in terms of airport compatibility and seat layout.\n\nJetZero has already attracted interest from United Airlines. In April, United Airlines Ventures, the division that invests in these innovative aircraft, said it planned to buy up to 200 of JetZero's 250-seat Z4s.\n\nManaging director Andrew Chang previously told Business Insider that the aircraft's expansive interior could be game changer that feels like a \"living room in the sky.\"\n\nJetZero successfully flew a subscale prototype called Pathfinder in 2024.",

    "fullText": "A pizza chain founded by the brother of tennis star Michael Chang, and once backed by NBA superstar Kevin Durant, is seeking bankruptcy protection after years of store closures.\n\nThe parent company of Pieology filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Tuesday in California, stating that its debts exceed its assets by at least double. The filing lists over 200 creditors, including many landlords and vendors.\n\nThe chain, founded in 2011, built its reputation on letting customers \"craft\" their own pizzas, calzones, and other foods. By 2022, it was boasting 130 locations in a press release announcing Shawn Thompson, a former Tim Hortons executive, as its CEO.\n\nIts website lists nearly 40 locations, mainly in California, but also in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii. Thompson, whose LinkedIn page suggests his term as CEO ended last month, didn't return a request for comment.\n\nRepresentatives for Pieology, which is expected to continue operating while the bankruptcy proceeds, didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn addition to the bankruptcy filing for Pieology's parent company, The Little Brown Box Pizza, Chang is also seeking bankruptcy protection for a company called Kustom Partner, which appears to be the administrative arm of Pieology.\n\nThe two companies filed for a form of Chapter 11 designed for small businesses that allows them to keep operating while they restructure their debts under court supervision.\n\nListed among Kustom Partner's creditors were numerous tax collectors from Florida, Oregon, Utah, Hawaii, Idaho, Georgia, Arizona, and more.\n\nIn a 2017 story about Durant's investment in Pieology, the basketball legend told ESPN that he was \"impressed with the quality\" of the pizza chain. Representatives for Durant didn't return a request for comment about the status of their investment. Pieology's bankruptcy filing said no one owns more than 10% of the company, suggesting no current institutional owners.\n\nThe Little Brown Box Pizza listed assets of between $100,000 and $500,000 compared to liabilities, or money owed, of between $1 million and $10 million.",

    "fullText": "Cracker Barrel released its Q1 results on Tuesday, reporting losses that sent its share price tumbling more than 9% in after-hours trading.\n\nThe beleaguered Southern restaurant chain reported a 5.7% drop in revenue compared to the prior year's first quarter, and a 4.7% decrease in comparable restaurant sales. It also reported a net income loss of $24.6 million.\n\n\"First quarter results were below our expectations amid unique and ongoing headwinds,\" Cracker Barrel president and chief executive Julie Masino said in a statement released ahead of the earnings call. \"We have adjusted our operational initiatives, menu, and marketing to ensure we are consistently delivering delicious food and exceptional experiences. Additionally, we are executing a variety of cost savings initiatives to bolster our financial performance. Although our recovery will take time, our teams are more committed than ever, and we are confident that we will regain momentum.\"\n\nAmong the headwinds are shifting consumer behaviors that have hit traditional sit-down chains especially hard, as budget-conscious diners trade down to cheaper, faster options and cut back on discretionary travel and dining out — both core drivers of Cracker Barrel's roadside business.\n\nThe company has also struggled to modernize its brand without alienating its base, a tension underscored by its botched logo redesign earlier this year, which sparked an online backlash and became an unexpected PR nightmare.\n\nDuring the earnings call, Masino mentioned that Cracker Barrel is working to \"rebuild trust\" with consumers following the rollback of the rebranding effort, with a focus on improving the guest experience through menu innovation and value-driven promotions — such as a recent all-you-can-eat pancake special and kids' meals that come with free toys.\n\n\"This team is absolutely committed to getting back to a positive trajectory and regaining the traffic momentum that we had and and getting getting back on our front foot here,\" Masino said. \"There's some brand rebuilding and trust rebuilding that we need to do, and there's a sales opportunity, and so we are doing both of those things.\"\n\nCracker Barrel's stock has fallen more than 50% so far this year.",

    "description": "After 15 years as a digital nomad, Kaisu Koskela went on her first cruise. She found it both exciting and overwhelming.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kaisu Koskela, 48, a postdoctoral researcher on digital nomads. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been a digital nomad for 15 years, so Nomad Cruise had been on my radar for a while. What began a decade ago as a relocation cruise for remote workers has grown into something much bigger — twice-yearly trips that feel like floating community conferences.\n\nAs a researcher and policy advisor on digital nomadism, I was especially curious. After some deliberation, my partner and I booked the 27-day Pacific crossing from Seattle to Sydney.\n\nNeither of us had ever been on a cruise before. It felt exciting, but also overwhelming.\n\nSomething was always happening: talks on life and work, meetups, and workshops. All of that was just the nomad program. The ship added even more, from cabaret shows to talks on local history. We also had full days ashore in places like Honolulu and Samoa.\n\nStarlink WiFi made working easy, and I met people in all kinds of fields, from AI to videography. But it was a long route, and no one was overly focused on productivity, including me.\n\nI'd planned to finish an article but never got to it, and honestly, I didn't mind. I was there for the experience.\n\nThe 230 passengers felt like a true snapshot of the nomad world. The youngest passenger was 23, and the oldest was in their 60s, but the majority were in their 30s.\n\nThe cruise is set up as a peer-learning conference: passengers give talks and share their expertise for free. I spoke about digital nomad visas and helped people one-on-one afterward. In return, before I got onstage a performance coach prepped me for my talk, and a designer explained a confusing part of my chart. Everyone gave something.\n\nI was surprised by how many passengers weren't nomads yet. They'd come for inspiration. Some were so enamored by the idea of location independence that they quit their jobs on the spot, pushed over the edge by burnout and encouraged by others to go freelance and build something of their own.\n\nA common theme kept coming up: Don't stay tied to an employer who's breaking you down.\n\nAs the days passed, we created more together. In the first week, someone formed a choir. I joined, and we rehearsed on every sea day before performing a full concert with professional lights and sound. I've had to sacrifice very little to be a digital nomad, but singing in a choir is off the table. Having one of my hobbies back for a month felt incredible.\n\nMeetups took off just as easily. I posted one for speed puzzling and ended up playing with a group that included someone who'd competed in the World Puzzling Championship. What started as a fangirl moment became real technique training.\n\nThe community was big enough that no matter how niche the interest, someone else shared it.\n\nLife onboard was easy — the staff were wonderful, and the vibe felt warm. But being a \"cruise tourist\" on land felt different\n\nVanuatu, an island archipelago in the South Pacific, was our final stop. It was also a new country for me. There, we were dropped on an otherwise uninhabited island where bars and food stalls had been set up just for us. Technically, I've now been to Vanuatu, but I had no contact with local life. I didn't love that.\n\nCruise stops are short; you're usually back onboard by 4:30 p.m. Early in the trip, after docking in Hawaii, we rushed around Maui trying to see everything. It felt pointless, a YouTube video would've given me the same overview.\n\nWe'd cracked the formula by the time we reached Savusavu in Fiji. It was a real town with a market, and we just wandered, with no agenda. I preferred those stops; even a tiny slice of local life beats racing through a checklist.\n\nThe remoteness of the Pacific was surreal. Seattle to Hawaii took a week; Hawaii to Samoa took another 16 days with no land, no ships — just ocean and the occasional pod of dolphins.\n\nThere was even a Crossing the Line ceremony for first-time equator crossers. We had to kiss a fish and jump into the pool. I loved it.\n\nNomad Cruise was expensive — €4,300, or about $5,000 each — so we thought hard before booking. We chose a basic cabin with a window and ate like royalty.\n\nAlcohol was extra, though happy hour made wine about $6 a glass. Onboard purchases came with an automatic 18% tip, plus a crew appreciation fee of about $17 per day. But reaching these destinations on our own would've cost more, and once we were on the ship, I stopped thinking about money; everything felt free.\n\nLeaving after a month on the cruise felt surreal; the community bubble was hard to step out of. I loved the people, the sunsets, and even the small things like watching the weather and birdlife change across the ocean.\n\nI'm sure I'll cross paths and deepen connections with some of the people I met on board. We shared something special.",

    "description": "AT&T CEO John Stankey said he was too slow on changing the company's culture, and that his viral employee memo was part of that process.",
    "fullText": "CEO John Stankey said he made some missteps in addressing company culture at AT&T — and shed some new light on his internal memo that went viral.\n\nThe lengthy memo, which was first reported by Business Insider in August, described how the company was moving to a \"more market-based culture,\" setting off discourse about the state of workplace loyalty.\n\nStankey gave some insight into the goal behind the memo during a conversation at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council Summit on Tuesday.\n\nWhen asked to name a mistake he's made, Stankey said he was too slow to tackle the \"culture evolution\" that was needed. He said he put it among several areas of focus for the company and that instead he should've put it at the forefront and forced specific actions to make it happen.\n\nAlan Murray, president of the WSJ Leadership Institute, suggested that was why Stanley sent that memo this year, rather than sooner.\n\n\"The memo shouldn't be over-rotated on. It's one of a series of steps in trying to put a framework out there and remove excuses for leaders to lead,\" Stankey said, adding the memo gave context on the framework he was building for the business.\n\n\"That memo outlined my point of view on it, and it gives leaders that want to lead all the air cover in the world they need to go and execute around that framework,\" he said.\n\nAT&T has undergone a number of changes as a company in the past year, including a return-to-office mandate of five days a week.\n\nIn the memo to employees, Stankey effectively said they should get on board with changes to the company culture, or get out.\n\n\"We run a dynamic, customer-facing business, tackling large-scale, challenging initiatives,\" Stankey said in the memo. \"If the requirements dictated by this dynamic do not align to your personal desires, you have every right to find a career opportunity that is suitable to your aspirations and needs.\"\n\nAt the event on Tuesday, Stankey also outlined how AT&T is pushing employees to adopt AI. He said the company has tutorials and other educational tools for employees to upskill with AI, and that he's paying attention to who is using them.\n\n\"I want to see who's building their skill set, where they're building, and this is just the next set of skills that people are going to have to have,\" he said.",

    "description": "Elon Musk said he wouldn't participate in the DOGE office again, adding that it was only \"somewhat\" successful in saving taxpayer money.",
    "fullText": "If he could do it all over again, Elon Musk says he wouldn't have participated in DOGE.\n\nSpeaking on \"The Katie Miller Podcast,\" the Tesla and SpaceX CEO said the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, a new office created at the beginning of President Donald Trump's second term, was only \"somewhat successful\" at saving taxpayer money, and Musk believes he could have better spent his time focused on his various business ventures.\n\n\"I guess I couldn't believe I was there for the most part. It's like — it all seemed extremely surreal at the time,\" Musk told Miller, who is married to Stephen Miller, who currently serves as White House deputy chief of staff.\n\nThe name DOGE itself, Musk said, was made up \"based on internet suggestions,\" and, while he still agrees that it's a worthwhile cause to try to slow government spending, he doesn't see his efforts as particularly effective during the months he worked alongside the Trump administration.\n\n\"We were a little bit successful. We were somewhat successful,\" Musk said. \"I mean, we stopped a lot of funding that really just made no sense, that was just entirely wasteful. For example, there was probably $100, maybe $200 billion worth of zombie payments per year, which simply by enforcing that there be a payment code and an explanation for the payment, the payment would not go out.\"\n\nWhile Musk had initially projected DOGE would save an estimated $2 trillion, he later revised his estimate to project nearly $150 billion in spending cuts for the 2026 fiscal year before he stepped back from the office in April, Business Insider has previously reported.\n\nWhile it is unclear exactly how much the office ultimately saved before it quietly disbanded in July, an August analysis by Politico verified $1.4 billion in confirmed contract cancellations and a decrease in federal spending.\n\nWhen asked directly by Miller whether he'd participate in the DOGE office if he could repeat history, Musk thought for just a moment before sighing and saying he would not.\n\n\"No, I don't think so. Would I do it? I think I probably — I don't know,\" Musk said. \"I think instead of doing DOGE, I would have basically built, you know, worked on my companies, essentially, and the cars — they wouldn't have been burning the cars.\"\n\nMusk faced intense public backlash and was the subject of numerous protests, including vandalism against Tesla, as a result of his work with the Trump administration. Musk described the backlash as \"a very strong reaction\" to his attempt to stop \"political corruption.\"\n\nThe fallout was also concerning to Tesla investors, some of whom worried Musk was spending too much time at the White House and not enough on the electric-vehicle maker.\n\n\"We think shareholders have legitimate concerns about Elon Musk being spread too thin, and it's become clear he's now spending more time on DOGE than anything else,\" Garrett Nelson, a senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, told Business Insider in March.\n\nTesla's stock plummeted in the first half of the year but began to rally after Musk announced he'd be leaving DOGE and officially stepped away in May. As of market close Tuesday, Tesla's stock was up over 17% this year.\n\nMusk's relationship with Trump soured in June after Musk criticized the president's \"Big Beautiful Bill.\" The pair publicly feuded for months, but Business Insider reported in November that the tension between the two had eased recently, and Musk was invited to Trump's White House dinner with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.",

    "title": "Wholesome Snack 2025: Everything Announced At The Cozy Showcase",
    "description": "Time to get wholesome!",
    "fullText": "on December 9, 2025 at 12:30PM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nWhile big, explosive video games with fast action and heavy drama are fun to play, sometimes you might be in the mood for something a little more lowkey, where you can simply turn on the game and lose yourself in it for a while. That's where the games featured in Wholesome Snack come in, as this showcase is tuned specifically to present games with a cozier, lighter side.\n\nTwenty-two games appeared on the menu in this year's Wholesome Snack, ranging from long-awaited sequels like Coffee Talk Tokyo, to new games like Arcane Eats and Fishbowl. The gallery below lists all 22 games shown off during today's presentation.\n\nThe Wholesome Games initiative, run by a team of just four people, is \"driven by the core values of finding and sharing games that are artistically driven, inclusive, and emotionally resonant.\" The organization also includes a publishing arm, Wholesome Games Presents, with its most recent published games including MakeRoom and Is This Seat Taken?\n\nSpellgarden Games began Wholesome Snack 2025 with Thrifty Business, in which players will own and operate a vintage thrift shop straight out of the 1990s. Everything in the store, from shelving arrangements to the decor on the walls, can be customized to the player's liking before customers come in and peruse the wares.\n\nLost and Found Co. stars the adorable Ducky, who works for a company that helps those in need find lost objects hidden in the world. Players will help Ducky find the hidden objects, solve puzzles, and more across multiple maps, from serene river scenes to bustling marketplaces.\n\nNext up was b-e-e-t-l-e: be right back, developed by a two-person team called Paul and Viv, which sees a cute little gator guy set off on a quest to find his pet beetle. Players will help the little fella find his friend through unique typing mechanics that help solve puzzles standing in his way.\n\nStudio Drydock's follow-up to popular Apple Arcade life sim Wylde Flowers, Wylde Society is a period drama that will mix afternoon tea with arcane magic within the magical boarding house known as Fairhaven.\n\nSpeaking of Wylde Flowers, Studio Drydock's first smash hit has been confirmed for release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox on PC ... and it's available now!\n\nTove Jansson's whimsical Moomin universe comes to life once again in Moomintroll: Winter's Warmth. The follow-up to Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley, Moomintroll sees the valley covered in snow and ice, and he must set off on a journey to free the land from Lady of the Cold.\n\nThe words \"post-apocalyptic adventure\" don't normally sound cozy, but Verdant's alternate version of 1980s Germany is trying to change that. Players will assume the role of a young adventurer trying to navigate this new world, while also finding their place within it.\n\nSpirit Crossing, the latest from Cozy Grove developer Spry Fox, is a cooperative life sim where players will build a village in a world of ancient ruins, spirits, and storms. Fishing, exploration, and even a little dancing will all be part of the village-building experience.\n\nTravel Pack is a narrative adventure with an interesting twist: The story is told through board games. As you meet new people and play games with them, you'll begin to learn more about them simply based on the way they use the on-screen tiles and figures to play the games with you.\n\nMirage: Miracle Quest is a new RPG from the team at the incredibly named Toe Bean Club. Players will control a \"freelance exorcist\" as they travel through a hand-painted world inspired by multiple real-world cultures, including France, Japan, and Madagascar.\n\nNext up was Cozy Caravan from 5 Lives Studios, in which players assume the role of a froggy caravan driver pulling into town for the annual Whizz Bang Fair. Cooking, baking, sewing, and more will all be part of the experience as the caravan travels between villages to help the citizens prepare to celebrate.\n\nFishbowl is a narrative game created by a two-person team in India, where it was supported by PlayStation's India Hero Project. The game follows a girl named Alo, both in the real world and in her dreams and memories, and weaves a tale about dreams, grief, and hope through Alo's everyday tasks, and the choices made while completing them.\n\nA new project from two members of Capybara Games, Find Your Words is a short and cozy adventure set at a children's summer camp. Players will play at the beach, hike through the forest, and more as they help a new camper find their way to new friendships.\n\nThis roguelike deckbuilder from Wonderbelly Games and Skystone Games puts players in the role of a master chef, who uses cards to concoct new and exotic meals to feed hungry customers. Decks are designed with specific food types in mind, and factors like cooking time and energy output must also be considered when building the perfect meal.\n\nCatchMaker mixes bug-catching and matching minigames in a cute and cozy new adventure from Grand Duck Games. Players will befriend a group of indigenous people on a faraway island, while exploring the player-character's past in order to unlock its secrets.\n\nIf you've ever played a merge game like Threes, PANdemonium: Merge takes that familiar setup and throws it into the frying pan, where pan movements will cause the food items within to merge together. Keep flipping to see what sort of wild merges you can make, but don't let your food fall out!\n\nZitifono is a light adventure game set on a line of tropical islands. Players will explore the islands using trains, boats, and other modes of transportation, while also solving puzzles to dig deep into the secrets the islands are keeping.\n\nChorus Worldwide Games brings its popular barista-like Coffee Talk to the shores of Japan with Coffee Talk Tokyo, where the patrons are a mixture of ordinary humans and otherworldly yokai. The clip shown during Wholesome Snack followed a child trying to share some good news, but who keeps getting overshadowed by the adults in the room.\n\nMandrake is a rural life sim set in a world inspired by British history and folklore and dotted with mystical powers and fantastical creatures. In the Wholesome Snack clip, our hero is greeted by the Yolf, a small creature looking to be repaid for long-standing debts, even though it was the character's ancestors who initially made the deal.\n\nThe creators of I Am Future are now in the technology-repair business, as ReStory is a shop-management simulator where players will restore game consoles, computers, and other tech from the era of Y2K. Dialogue-based choices will arise during the game as well, and the way players respond will affect the story's next direction.\n\nD-Topia places players in the role of a \"facilitator\" for a world-controlling AI, and his goal is to keep the residents of the titular D-Topia happy, however possible. Players will solve puzzles and interact with the AI in order to \"maximize happiness\" and keep the peace in D-Topia.\n\nThe final announcement from Wholesome Snack 2025 will appeal to rhythm fans, as the showcase gave us a new look at upcoming rhythm game Bits & Bops. Several new minigames were shown off in the new trailer, along with a big surprise: Bits & Bops is available on Steam now.",

So far in 2025, numerous developers lost their jobs, Microsoft canceled games, and the industry further consolidated with EA announcing plans to sell itself to Saudi Arabia.\nSpeaking to The Game Business, Keighley said the introduction of the Game Changer award in 2024 was an initial attempt to address this. Amir Satvat was given the prize for his work to support people who were laid off in the gaming industry.\nKeighley hasn't said if this award is coming back in 2025, but it would be a glaring omission if it did not.",

    "description": "Jewel thieves walked right past it.",
    "fullText": "They say one person's trash is another's treasure, but a chunk of 'rock' used to keep a door open for decades is a treasure by almost anyone's standards.\n\nA woman discovered the 3.5-kilogram (7.7-pound) stone in a stream bed in southeast Romania, brought it home, and used it as a doorstop.\n\nHer find turned out to be one of the biggest intact chunks of amber in the world, according to a report by El Pais.\n\nIts value? Somewhere in the region of €1 million – around US$1.1 million.\n\nWatch the video below for a summary:\n\nIn Romania, pieces of amber can be found around the village of Colti in sandstone from the banks of the River Buzau, where it has been mined since the 1920s.\n\nKnown as rumanite, this amber is famed and prized for its wide array of deep, reddish hues.\n\nThe elderly woman who found this particular rumanite nugget lived in Colti, where it remained performing a function so humble that it was missed even by jewel thieves who once targeted the home, reports say.\n\nAfter the woman died in 1991, the relative who inherited her home suspected the doorstop might be more than meets the eye.\n\nOn learning what he had, he sold the amber to the Romanian state, which had it appraised by experts at the Museum of History in Krakow in Poland.\n\nAccording to these experts, the amber is likely around 38 to 70 million years old.\n\n\"Its discovery represents a great significance both at a scientific level and at a museum level,\" Daniel Costache, director of the Provincial Museum of Buzau, told El Pais.\n\nClassified as a national treasure of Romania, the nugget has had a home at the Provincial Museum of Buzau – the county in which the relic was found – since 2022.\n\nThe discovery resembles that of a man in Michigan, who kept a large piece of rock as a doorstop, only to find out decades later that he was keeping his doors in place with a meteorite worth $100,000.\n\nA chunk of amber worth over a million dollars isn't a bad score, either, really. Just imagine how many doorstops you could buy.\n\nAmber is tree resin from millions of years in the past. Over time, the highly viscous substance fossilizes into a hard, warm-hued material widely recognized as a gemstone.\n\nAbove ground, tree resin can act like a sticky trap, collecting impressively intact specimens of the invertebrate population for us to study millions of years later.\n\nThough it is fairly common in the Northern Hemisphere, amber has only been discovered intermittently in the southern half of the planet.\n\nDuring the Barremian period, around 122 million years ago, massive amounts of resin were formed by coniferous trees around the world, which reigned over all plants until about 70 million years ago.\n\nIncredible, 112-million-year-old amber recently found at the Genoveva quarry in Ecuador has preserved at least five orders of insects, including a variety of flies, a fungus beetle, wasps, and a caddisfly.\n\nIt also caught evidence of arachnid activity, in the form of a fragment of spider web. The way the strands are oriented suggests the web may have been built in the style of modern orb-weavers, though it lacks the sticky droplets typical of these kinds of webs.\n\n\"These findings provide direct evidence of a humid, resinous forest ecosystem and its arthropod fauna in equatorial Gondwana during the Cretaceous Resinous Interval,\" paleobiologist Xavier Delclòs from the University of Barcelona and colleagues explain in their paper, published in September.\n\nIn 2024, scientists in Germany and the UK discovered amber in West Antarctica for the first time – the fossilized 'blood' of ancient coniferous trees that once grew on Earth's southernmost continent between 83 and 92 million years ago.\n\nAlong with fossils of roots, pollen, and spores, the finding provides some of the best evidence yet that a mid-Cretaceous, swampy rainforest existed near the South Pole, and that this prehistoric environment was \"dominated by conifers\", similar to forests in New Zealand and Patagonia today.\n\n\"Our goal now is to learn more about the forest ecosystem – if it burned down, if we can find traces of life included in the amber,\" said marine geologist Johann Klages from the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany.\n\n\"This discovery allows a journey to the past in yet another more direct way.\"\n\nThanks to the magic of amber, there are even a few ancient tardigrades that have been preserved for millions of years.\n\nAn earlier version of this article was published in September 2024.\n\nAn Animal Expert Explains Why Your Dog Keeps Hiding Everything\n\nComplex Life May Be a Billion Years Older Than We Thought\n\nThis Prehistoric Bird Choked to Death on 800 Rocks, And No One Knows Why",

    "description": "The virus spreads easily and in different ways than other winter viruses. Here’s what to know.",
    "fullText": "Stuffy noses and bothersome coughs aren’t the only winter illness symptoms making the rounds right now. Lots of people are also getting sick with norovirus, an unpleasant stomach bug. The highly contagious virus is on the rise in many states across the country.\n\nWhat is norovirus? “It is our most common cause of vomiting and diarrhea, and actually food-borne illness in the United States,” said Dr. Brintha Vasagar, a family physician in Wisconsin.\n\nHealth: 4 Parts Of Your Body You Shouldn't Forget To Exercise\n\nThose are the two most common symptoms, but fever, body aches and stomachaches are sometimes reported, too.\n\nHuffPost Life delivers practical, reliable advice to navigate life’s challenges and make informed decisions. Support journalism that empowers you — join our membership program today.\n\nWe typically experience higher rates of norovirus “from November to April, so we’re still pretty early in this season,” Vasagar added.\n\nNorovirus cases are currently elevated, but a little lower than where they were by this time last year, said Dr. Camile Gooden, an internal medicine physician at NYU Langone Hospital—Suffolk in New York. However, “Recently, there has been a surge in norovirus ... we’re seeing more positive testing,” Gooden added. This is due to a new strain of the virus.\n\nHealth: Norovirus Cases Are Surging. These Are The Most Common Symptoms Doctors Are Seeing Right Now.\n\nThe virus spreads easily and in different ways than other winter viruses. Here’s what to know:\n\nWhile common winter illnesses such as the flu and COVID-19 spread through coughs and sneezes, norovirus spreads differently.\n\n“Traditionally, it’s [spread through] what we call the fecal-oral route, so stool to mouth, but it’s a pretty darn resilient virus, so it’s not like you’re licking other people’s poop,” said Dr. Ross Newman, a pediatrician based in Oregon and a medical communicator on social media.\n\nInstead, contaminated particles end up on people’s hands or surfaces they touch — and can sometimes even spread through the air, he explained.\n\nHealth: I'm A Hip Surgeon. Here's The 1 Thing I'd Never Do If I Have Hip Pain.\n\nIf someone who has norovirus doesn’t wash their hands well after using the bathroom and then uses a towel to dry their hands, that towel can then become a carrier. Then, if a non-infected person uses that towel to dry their hands, they could pick up the virus.\n\n“It can exist on surfaces for long periods of time ... it can be on blankets, gloves, clothing, hair, skin ... or it can just be from filthy hands,” Newman added.\n\nContaminated surfaces can become a “source of spread,” added Gooden, which is how norovirus commonly rips through places with long-term care settings, day cares and cruise ships — all spaces where people are in close quarters and touching the same door handles, tables, light switches and toys.\n\nNorovirus can also spread through contaminated food, according to Gooden. “If you eat food that has not been washed properly and is contaminated, you could also get ill,” noted Gooden.\n\nHealth: 14 Popular 'Healthy' Habits From 2025 That Aren't Actually Healthy\n\nThis could be from a sick person preparing the food or even from contaminated raw produce, she said.\n\n“You want to make sure that when you are consuming raw vegetables and raw fruits, that those have been washed appropriately because sometimes, even on farms, there might be exposure through irrigation systems to norovirus,” Gooden said.\n\nYou don’t need any fancy produce soaps, instead washing produce well with water is enough to kill the virus, Gooden said.\n\nNorovirus can also spread through shellfish that becomes contaminated by infected water. In this case, fully cooking shellfish can kill the virus, according to Vasagar.\n\nHealth: New Study Reveals When The ‘Adulthood’ Brain Phase Actually Starts — And It’s Way Later Than You Think\n\n“The best way to protect yourself is really to perform good hand washing — and you have to use soap and water. You can’t rely on hand sanitizers necessarily, especially if you’ve touched contaminated surfaces or have come in contact with someone who is ill with norovirus,” Gooden said.\n\nA quick hand rinse isn’t good enough; use hot water and soap, and wash your hands for “the full Happy Birthday song, twice,” Vasagar stressed. “Most people don’t wash their hands long enough to really be effective.”\n\nBeyond hand-washing, disinfecting surfaces with bleach-based cleansers and washing linens frequently can kill the virus, Vasagar noted. This is especially important if someone in your home is sick.\n\n“The spread is ... so contagious that you’re really going to have to work hard to make sure everyone else in the family doesn’t get it,” Vasagar said.\n\n“The vomiting associated with norovirus is generally short-lived, 24 to 48 hours, but the diarrhea can last two weeks,” Newman said.\n\nPeople are most contagious the first one or two days after their symptoms start, but they can shed the virus for weeks after that point, Newman added.\n\nIf you get sick, stay home (and keep sick kids home) if you’re able, all three experts told HuffPost. Also watch out for dehydration, which is “the biggest concern with complications from most stomach bugs,” Newman said.\n\n“You’re losing a lot of fluids with vomiting, a lot of fluids with diarrhea,” Vasagar said. Signs of dehydration include decreased urination, dizziness, dry mouth, and confusion and fatigue. If you notice any of these symptoms, get to a doctor.\n\nTo combat dehydration, drink plenty of fluids, whether that’s water, tea, Gatorade or soup, Gooden noted. Even if you’re throwing up, you should still drink small amounts of fluids.\n\n“It’s really important to monitor for any development of severe symptoms,” Gooden said. “If your symptoms continue beyond 72 hours, usually, that’s a time that I would advise to reach out to your health care professional.”\n\nIf you have fevers, severe abdominal pain or develop blood in your stool, you should seek medical attention, Gooden added.\n\nThe Worst Things You Can Do During Cold And Flu Season\n\nExperts Warn This Winter Virus Will 'Likely Cause A Problem' — Here’s How To Prepare For It\n\nDoctors Say A Highly Infectious Virus Is 'Out Of Control' Right Now.

    "fullText": "A recent statewide ranking named the Austin-area suburb Leander as the No. 5 best city in Texas to move to for 2025, and other Austin neighbors made the list as well.\n\nThe analysis, conducted by a customer review and news platform called ConsumerAffairs, evaluated the 50 most populated Texas cities across five categories: affordability, safety, economy, health care and education, in addition to overall quality of life, to determine which cities were best to move to. Each city earned a score out of 100 possible points.\n\nLeander stood out, the analysis said, for its safety ranking — No. 1 statewide — and it also secured the No. 2 spot for its booming economy.\n\nHowever, the city’s rankings were more modest in other areas. The report ranked Leader No. 12 for health care and education, No. 32 for affordability and No. 40 for quality of life.\n\n“Leander’s origin dates back to the 1880s, when a rail line was constructed to connect Austin to Abilene,” the report said. “Nowhere among Texas’ largest cities is violent crime less common, and over the past five years, no metro area has experienced faster job growth.”\n\nThe suburb, which has a population of around 78,000, was also ranked as one of the top ten places to live by U.S. News and World Reports for 2025-2026.\n\nThe top four cities on the ConsumerAffairs list were all in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, followed by Leander and then Round Rock at No. 9.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK — Another round of bone-chilling air from the Polar Vortex could invade the central and northeastern U.s. this weekend and potentially produce the first significant snowstorm of the season for the Interstate 95 corridor if this cold air meets up with moisture that is expected to race across the country.\n\nCurrent computer forecast model guidance suggests that snow will move into the Midwest Saturday and into the Northeast by Sunday. However, uncertainty remains high regarding all aspects of any snowfall, and those who will be in the Midwest and Northeast should monitor forecast changes as the week progresses.\n\nAccording to the FOX Forecast Center, current forecast models show the circulation of the Polar Vortex weakening later this week into the weekend, which will allow more cold air to spill into the Midwest and Northeast.\n\nThis comes after record low temperatures were already set on Tuesday in New England.\n\nThe Polar Vortex is a large, persistent area of low pressure and cold air near the poles and sits about 10-30 miles above Earth’s surface. A strong Polar Vortex keeps the coldest air contained over the arctic circles; a weaker Polar Vortex allows that frigid air to drop into the lowest level of the atmosphere and dips in the Pacific jet stream usher that cold air from Canada into the Lower 48.\n\nIf enough cold air is able to take hold of the Midwest and Northeast this weekend, it would create prime snow-making conditions for a quick-moving storm system that is currently forecast to move east out of the Pacific Northwest.\n\nWatch: Virginia State Police Trooper Rescues Driver From Burning Vehicle During Dangerous Winter Weather\n\nThis system would also need additional moisture to move up from the south to produce significant snow.\n\nParade Of Fast-moving Clippers Threaten Midwest And Northeast With More Snow, Rain And Strong Winds\n\nIf all these conditions are met, an area of low pressure could form near the coast this weekend, increasing the chance for significant snow across the Northeast, including the Boston, Philadelphia and New York metro areas.\n\nThis would be the first significant snow for that portion of the Interstate 95 corridor.\n\nHowever, if one of these components is missing, snow totals would be depressed.\n\nThis latest storm bears out the long-range outlook from Noaa last month that forecast an active start to meteorological winter, due in part to the La Niña climate pattern.\n\nCheck back for updates on this developing story.\n\nOriginal article",

    "fullText": "Though the film series petered out after only a couple of movies, Rick Riordan's middle-grade Camp Half-Blood have been revived as a mega-popular Disney+ streaming series. The breathing room offered by a series format seems to have been the key to unlocking their potential as an adaptation, allowing for a more fully realized exploration of this atypical (at least on our side of Mount Olympus) coming-of-age story.\n\nIn its first season, the show found a good balance between fantasy action and teen drama while also having a ton of fun poking at the conventions of ancient myth. Season two is just out, and more is on the way, but it's likely to be a bit of a wait. In the meantime, here are 12 more shows that offer a similar mix of coming-of-age angst, action, and myths and legends.\n\nDoing for fairy tales what Percy Jackson does for Greek mythology, this long-running prime time drama stars Jennifer Morrison as Emma Swan, a struggling bail bond agent who travels to the Maine town of Storybrooke (subtle!) to reconnect with the son who she gave up for adoption. In the process, she discovers that she’s the daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming, given up to protect her from the machinations of Regina (Lana Parrilla), the evil queen who is also responsible for the curse that dropped an endless number of fairy tale characters into this small town to live dreary normal lives without any memories of their past adventures (at least at first). Stream Once Upon a Time on Disney+ and Hulu.\n\nThe tone is very different, but there are thematic and plot similarities aplenty in this appropriately dark fantasy, adapted from the beloved YA series by Philip Pullman and set in an alternate world in which human souls exist outside the body in the form of animal companions called daemons. Lyra Belacqua (Dafne Keen) is an orphaned girl living at Jordan College, Oxford who finds herself involved in a murder plot that brings her into the orbit of the powerful Magisterium, the world's overarching and oppressive religious authority—caught between her mother (Ruth Wilson), a powerful figure in the Magisterium, and her extremist heretic father (James McAvoy). From her steampunk-ish world, Lyra and her daemon Pan travel across a multiverse that includes our very own Earth. Stream His Dark Materials on HBO Max.\n\nAn update to the Winx Club Nickelodeon animated series from back in the day, this show follows five fairies attending a prestigious boarding school for magical types. Not entirely unlike Percy Jackson, our lead fire fairy Bloom soon discovers that her parentage is more alien (literally) than she'd ever known. After a slow start, the show builds into an impressive coming-of-age story, and a rare fantasy series genuinely geared to its teenage target audience. It was cancelled after two seasons, but if you find yourself hooked, a series of graphic novels continues the story. Stream Fate: The Winx Saga on Netflix.\n\nIf \"unacknowledged love children of gods\" is your thing, well, Greek mythology has you covered. Set in an ancient Greek of myth, this adult-oriented animated series introduces Heron, an original character who nevertheless fits firmly in the tradition; here, he's a young miner, illegitimate and thus scorned by his fellow villagers. When demons attack, Heron discovers he's the secret son of Zeus, and that he'll need to help lead humanity defeat flesh-eating creatures born from the blood of fallen titans. Intimately plotted and with an increasingly epic scope, the show blends Greek myth with anime style to tell an addictive original story. Stream Blood of Zeus on Netflix.\n\nThe South Korean import became Disney/Hulu's most-watched K-drama, and did solid business globally (even if the English-language title doesn't suggest major thrills). As the series opens, we meet Kim Bong-seok (Lee Jung-ha), literally weighted down by his mom (as in: she gives him weights to fill his pockets) as he's heading off to school; we soon learn that it's because he can't quite control his ability to fly, and is prone to floating off unexpectedly. Athlete Jang Hui-soo (Go Youn-jung) heals instantly from injuries, while class president Lee Gang-hoon (Kim Do-hoon) is fast and incredibly strong. As it turns out, all of these kids' parents were bred and trained as part of a black ops program from which they've escaped, passing along their abilities to their kids—who have to stifle their powers, lest they draw the attention of spies hunting them down. Stream Moving on Disney+ and Hulu.\n\nNo Greek mythology here (well, we do get a gorgon or two), but Sabrina is also the story of a young woman coming to terms with her destiny at a special school for people with unique powers while having (dark) adventures. Rather than the daughter of a god, Sabrina is a literal child of Lucifer. Sabrina Spellman (Kiernan Shipka) is an old-school witch in a household that’s not at all unlike the Addams family: two witchy aunts (played by Miranda Otto and Lucy Davis) alongside her warlock cousin (Chance Perdomo) and her loyal familiar, Salem the cat, all of them living their witchy lives just out of view of the local normies. At the outset, Sabrina's forced to choose between signing her name in Satan’s book and becoming a full-fledged witch, or staying in high school with her human friends. Instead, she refuses to choose. Cannibalism, human sacrifice, and blood rituals result, as Sabrina is called upon to save her family, and the world, from dark forces. Stream Chilling Adventures of Sabrina on Netflix.\n\nIn this animated series, teenager Luz Noceda (Sarah-Nicole Robles) finds herself trapped in the Demon Realm and there befriends a nonconformist witch Eda Clawthorne (Wendie Malick), who undertakes to teach the non-magical Luz everything she can about magic. Luz is determined to become a full-fledged witch despite her complete lack of prior experience, which is entirely refreshing given the volume of narratives about kids who just kinda discover that they're super-powered nepo babies. Busting open the doors for LGBTQ+ representation on the Disney Channel, this show is chock full of queer characters, and it remained both creatively offbeat and adorable throughout its now completed run. Stream The Own House on Disney+.\n\nA (sorta) standalone spin-off from the rather extensive Vampire Diaries universe, Legacies follows Hope Mikaelson (Danielle Rose Russell), an orphan descended from bloodlines that include vampires, witches, and werewolves—meaning the Salvatore School for the Young and Gifted suits her perfectly. Supernatural beings of all sorts attend, and it serves as a secret haven and training ground for those with powers. It's a place where they can learn to control and/or conceal their abilities—sort of a cross between Wednesday's Nevermore Academy and Camp Half-Blood. The drama is a little more YA to Percy's middle-grade, and naturally, teen angst and romance abound. Stream Legacies on Netflix.\n\nFifteen-year-old American Cece Parker Jones travels to Paris to join the prestigious dance school, only to discover that she's an actual witch from a family with a history of magic. She struggles to balance dance, magic, and her desire to be a normal teenager while dealing with the Mystics, natural enemies to Cece's type of witch. It's a solidly entertaining blend of teen drama, magical duels, and uniquely, ballet. (it's a standalone successor to the time travel-focused Find Me in Paris, which is also on Hulu). Stream Spellbound on Hulu.\n\nBased on the seminal, semi-autobiographical 2006 graphic novel from Gene Luen Yang, this adaptation introduces Jin Wang (Ben Wang), a nerdy and rather ordinary son of Taiwanese immigrants. He befriends confident, generally loud and proud exchange student Wei-Chen (Jimmy Liu), who's embarrassing and inspiring in equal measure. It's soon revealed that Wei-Chen is no ordinary kid, but rather the son of legendary Chinese figure the Monkey King, and he's on Earth looking for the ordinary teenager he believes can help him stop an uprising against Heaven. Ke Huy Quan co-stars as the former child star of a deeply stereotypical '80s sitcom, and Michelle Yeoh appears as goddess of compassion Guanyin. It's disappointing that this only lasted one season, but it tells a fairly complete story nonetheless. Stream American Born Chinese on Disney+.\n\nIn an alternate modern Britain, ghosts are an everyday sight, which is not to say they aren't a nuisance—their touch is deadly. Technological progress has largely ground to a halt, while ghost-hunting agencies are common and, since adults lose the ability to sense ghosts directly, kids and teens are the ones on the front lines. Ruby Stokes (Bridgerton) plays Lucy Carlyle, an extremely sensitive listener who was cast aside when she was unfairly blamed for several deaths at her first job. With nowhere else to go, she joins up with the shady, unregulated Lockwood & Co., a two-orphan operation working outside the law. It's a solidly spooky teen drama with a fair bit of action and a beating heart, in and among all of the dead people. Stream Lockwood & Co. on Netflix.\n\nThis one's definitely not for the young ones, but if you're a grown-up-type person looking for a bit more on Greek mythology, you could do worse than this BBC take on The Iliad (and other Trojan War narratives). Adapting events in and around Homer's work, we begin with the judgment of Paris (Louis Hunter), who's asked by Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite to award an apple to the one he favors most; the goddesses here appear as human-esque characters, marking a change from older takes that saw giants watching from Olympus, and more recent adaptations that do away with gods altogether. We then meet Helen (Bella Dayne), a Spartan citizen in a loveless marriage, before following the action to Troy. The show has a lush, bronze-age aesthetic and displays an impressive fidelity to its varied source material. Stream Troy: Fall of a City on Prime Video and Netflix.",

    "title": "10 Hacks Every iPhone User Should Know",
    "description": "Time to power up.",
    "fullText": "I'm routinely surprised by just how much technology Apple has managed to pack into the iPhone that I can carry in the palm of my hand. What's even more surprising is that underneath the layers, there's even more than what meets the eye. There's a better, faster way to use the keyboard, there's a faster way to select unread emails to archive, there are better ways to browse the web than just the usual Safari experience, and you can get way better photos out of the iPhone Pro cameras than what the stock Camera app shows you.\n\nThe iPhone has become such a default product in all our lives that we just take it for granted. Yes, it's a great way to stay in touch with friends and coworkers, to capture moments, and to doomscroll the night away. But spend some more time, and there's a whole new iPhone experience just waiting for you that will truly transform how your iPhone looks and works.\n\nApple installs the Shortcuts app on every device and even offers pre-built shortcut automations that you can install from the Gallery. But the fun starts when you explore the very active Shortcuts community online and start to integrate Automations into the mix.\n\nApple’s Shortcuts app lets you create automations that automatically follow pre-defined steps. They can be used to resize images, compress files, convert data, and even control aspects of your smartphone. For example, you can create an automation that automatically enables a VPN when you step out of your home, or sends a message to your partner when you leave work. Looking to get started? We have a list of seven automations that I feel every iPhone user should install.\n\nI’m a huge fan of custom widgets. Whenever someone picks up my iPhone, the response is usually something like, \"Your iPhone doesn’t look like a regular iPhone.\" That’s down to custom widgets that show the time, day, my appointments, the weather, my tasks, and more. The world of custom iPhone widgets is huge, and if you just want to dip your toes in, I would suggest you start with the Widgetsmith app, which lets you customize multiple widgets with the same theme and fonts. All together, it looks really aesthetically pleasing. When you’re ready, you can dive in with the Widgy app, where you can import and customize thousands of interactive widgets.\n\nThe iPhone has a hidden button, and it’s on the back of your iPhone. It’s an accessibility feature that you can access via Settings > Accessibility > Touch > Back Tap. You can then assign any app, shortcut, or action to either the Double Tap or Triple Tap gesture. It’s a great way to trigger Shortcuts automations, or to simply bring up the selfie camera. I personally find that the double-tap gesture has a tendency to misfire sometimes, and the triple-tap gesture is a lot more reliable.\n\nIf you don’t use Safari extensions, you’re sleeping on unrealized potential. Just like on the Mac, the Safari browser on the iPhone also supports extensions. And you can use extensions to do some really cool things, like blocking all ads and trackers (of course), but also to force every website to be in dark mode, all the time. You’ll also find extensions to improve the Reddit browsing experience and to take complete control of all the elements on the websites you use frequently.\n\nUsing a third-party browser, like Vivaldi, is a very power-user move. All third-party browsers on iOS are technically variations of Safari, as Apple forces developers to build their browsers on Safari's WebKit platform. However, these third-party browsers can include unique features that Safari doesn't. Vivaldi, for example, offers desktop-class tab browsing, including tab groups and pinned tabs. Then there’s Orion, which can run desktop-class extensions from Firefox and Chrome Web Store on your iPhone (something that Safari can’t do). And if you don’t like Safari’s new interface, try out Quiche, which is a completely customizable browser.\n\nFocuses have the potential to transform how your iPhone looks and works, based on your location, time, day, or the task at hand. It’s time to go beyond Do Not Disturb and embrace everything that Apple's Focuses can do.\n\nIt would be a good idea for you to set up Focuses for Work, Personal Time, and Sleep. In each Focus, you can decide which apps can send notifications, and which friends or family members can contact you. You can even choose which home screens to show in particular Focus, choosing to hide widgets and apps depending on the Focus (no work stuff at all in Personal Time Focus, for example). Focus also integrates with Shortcuts and Automations, so you can trigger a Focus when you start a video call on your Mac or reach a particular location (like your workplace). Go to Settings > Focus to get started.\n\nYou’ll be familiar with all the usual iPhone gestures, like swiping up from the Home bar, or tapping the top edge of the iPhone to instantly scroll to the top. But the iPhone has a lot more hidden gestures that can really speed things up. If you see a long list, try to swipe down with two fingers to instantly start selecting items. This works really well in Mail, Phone, and other Apple apps, but is also supported by third-party apps. Next, in iOS 26, Apple added back gesture support that’s arguably better than Android. You can swipe in from anywhere on the left edge to quickly go back.\n\nYou can also cut, copy, and paste with a three-finger gesture. To copy something, pinch it with three fingers. To cut, do it twice. To paste something, do a three-finger spread gesture (opposite of the pinch).\n\nThe iPhone keyboard is more than what meets the eye. It has a built-in Slide to Type feature where you can glide your finger over the keys to type words. It works really well, especially when using the phone one-handed. There’s a virtual trackpad built in, too. Just tap and hold the Space bar and move your finger to move the cursor around.\n\nIf you find your keyboard too large to type on, you can also enable the one-handed keyboard from the Keyboard Settings button (tap and hold the Globe icon). From here, you can go to Keyboard Settings to enable a multi-lingual keyboard and to try out Text Replacement, where you can create shortcuts for expanding your frequently used text snippets. For example, you can type “adrs” to expand to your full home address.\n\nYou might not know this, but there’s a really neat document scanner built into the Notes app and the Files app. I prefer to use the Files app for this because I get to save a PDF directly in the folder that I want. Open the Files app, go to any folder, tap the three-dotted Menu icon, and choose the Scan Documents feature. There’s an Auto Shutter feature that’s enabled by default that will automatically scan each new page you put in front of your camera (if you find this annoying, you can disable it as well). Scan as many pages as you want, and tap the Done button. Then, give the document a name. And it’s now stored as a PDF in the folder. You can now send it to where it needs to go, or back it up using iCloud Drive.\n\nThe cameras on the iPhone Pro are truly stellar. But the Camera app is not. The default Camera app does too much computational photography for my taste, and has trouble focusing on elements exactly when I need to capture something small. Plus, the Pro cameras can shoot in Log in ProRes, and to fully take control of the visuals from your iPhone, you’ll need to step out of the Camera app.\n\nFor shooting video in the best light, Blackmagic is a great choice. Here, you get full manual control over both photos and videos, with film-grade presets (including the ability to create your own custom ones).\n\nIf that feels a bit too Pro, try using a third-party app to capture much better photos. My colleague Pranay has highlighted a couple of great options, with Halide Mark II topping the list (I agree, as well). Halide gives you a lot more control over the look of your photos. There’s also a Process Zero feature that removes all of Apple’s computational processes from the photos.",

    "title": "You Might Be A 'Lower-Class' Retiree If Your Social Security Check Is Below This Number",
    "description": "Is your Social Security check below this number? You might only be earning a fraction of the average Social Security benefit -- here's how to change that.",
    "fullText": "To earn Social Security benefits, workers must reach an earnings benchmark during their career years and pay corresponding payroll taxes into the Social Security Administration (SSA). Other than self-employed workers, employees don't forward payroll taxes directly. Instead, employers withhold and pay an amount based upon each employee's compensation levels that SSA credits to the employee's account. To become eligible to receive Social Security retirement benefits, workers must earn 40 or more credits; since 1978, workers can earn up to four credits annually. So, someone might work ten years with maximum credits or more years with fewer annual credits to quality. The dollar amount needed to earn a credit may change annually: in 2025, earning $1,810 equalled one credit.\n\nThe amount of a person's check, however, is not based on credits earned. As described by SSA, the agency calculates a person's earnings over a 35-year period. SSA then adjusts those earnings to account for typical wage levels taking place during the person's employment years to determine that worker's indexed earnings. After SSA has gathered this information, the agency then focuses on years with the highest indexed earnings to calculate an average and the benefit amount. Higher earners will therefore receive bigger retirement checks from Social Security than lower earners. SSA doesn't directly label anyone as a lower earning retiree. If, though, this is defined as receiving less than the average Social Security income, as of August 2025, the SSA listed the average monthly benefit for retired workers as $2,008.31.\n\nIn 2024, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities — according to GOBankingRates reporting — defined low earners as people earning 45% less than the typical wage. Defined this way, the average annual Social Security benefit for lower earners who retired at age 65 came in at $14,824. Broken down, that's $1,235 monthly. As reported by SmartAsset, effective in 1972, very low-income workers could potentially benefit from a program that provides a Special Minimum Benefit based on working years rather than earnings. To qualify, the low-earning worker needs to work 11 or more years, paying in an undefined \"significant amount\" to the Social Security Trust Fund. Using 2025 figures, someone with 11 years of working experience would receive $52.10 monthly. To get the full special minimum benefit, someone must have worked 30 or more years. The benefit in 2025 would be $1,093.10.\n\nIf someone retires before their full retirement age, which currently ranges from 66 to 67, depending upon their birth year, they can still earn a certain amount of employment wages, although with potential negative tax consequences. In 2026, the Social Security earnings limit is increasing to $24,480. (This wouldn't have much of an income tax impact for those low earners who probably wouldn't earn this amount.) In general, if someone doesn't earn the current standard deduction amount, they may not even need to file a tax return. For a single taxpayer, in 2026, the standard deduction amount is $16,100.\n\nUnlock your financial potential. Add Money Digest to your preferred sources for smart money insights!",

    "title": "Pebble Is Releasing a $75 Ring, but It’s Not an Oura Competitor",
    "description": "The ring has a button for voice memos, but Pebble users don't seem too impressed.",
    "fullText": "When I hear that a smartwatch company is launching a ring, I assume it’s going to be a smart ring. But Pebble went a different direction, instead creating what’s basically a remote microphone that can work with your phone and other devices. It's available for pre-order for $75, and will sell for $99 after launch.\n\nPebble’s new ring is called the Index 01. It’s got a button you can click and hold, and a microphone that will listen to what you’re saying as you hold the button. The recording is then sent to your phone, where it’s processed on-device. That's it—no heart rate sensor, and no charging dock.\n\nEric Migicovsky, Pebble’s founder, describes using the Index to capture short messages and send instructions to his Pebble watch via his phone. The idea is that you wear the Index on your index finger (get it?) and press the button with your thumb. The ring comes in three colors: matte black with a black button, polished gold with a blue button, and silver with a white button.\n\nThere is no battery to charge, just a built-in battery that lasts a total of 12 to 15 hours. Migicovsky writes: “On average, I use it 10-20 times per day to record 3-6 second thoughts. That’s up to 2 years of usage.”\n\nThe ring doesn’t have a speaker and can’t vibrate for notifications; it’s just for input. Communication between the ring and your phone is encrypted, and the voice recordings are processed into text on your phone, without requiring an internet connection. The ring doesn’t talk directly to a Pebble watch, but it can talk to your phone and your phone can then display any output to the watch—for example, displaying the text of a reminder that you set.\n\nSo far, Pebble users don’t seem to be nearly as excited about this product as Migicovsky is. A Reddit thread discussing the announcement has comments like “Cool idea, weird product,” and “Why would I want this if I already have a Pebble that has all the capability to take voice notes?”\n\nMigicovsky explains in the company’s blog post that his goal was for the button to be operated with one hand, and gestures on the Pebble weren’t reliable enough. He also emphasizes the fact you don’t need to charge it, while some of the users seem to be more concerned that a device that can't be charged is basically disposable—\"manufactured e-waste.\"\n\nAfter about two years of use (or less, if you make longer recordings), the app will ask if you’d like to order another ring. The ring will cost $75 to pre-order, and $99 at its regular price. There hasn’t been any mention of a discounted rate for a replacement; it sounds like you’re supposed to buy a new $99 ring every two years.\n\nThe ring’s functionality could be extended in the future. A double click-and-hold could signal the Pebble app to process the data in a different way (perhaps sending it to ChatGPT, Migicovsky suggests) and developers could connect the voice processing in the app to other services like calendar and weather apps.",

    "fullText": "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nThe average American 65 years of age and up earns an annual income of approximately $65,468 in Q3 2025 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) (1). The latest data, from 2023, shows that same group spends roughly $60,087 yearly, or about $4,622 a month, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (2).\n\nThat income doesn’t leave a lot of extra cash for unexpected expenses or emergencies. The average American aged 65-69 has about $200,000 in retirement savings, according to an analysis of the 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) data (3), and might still need to work even when they reach retirement age. High expenses often play a role.\n\nThese four categories of spending tend to eat into monthly expenses — here’s how you can shave some zeros off them.\n\nHome costs represent the largest expense for retirees, amounting to $21,445 of their annual expenses in 2023, according to the Consumer Expenditures Surveys (CE) (4). Retirees who want to gain a leg up may want to consider downsizing as house prices remain high.\n\nThat could mean selling your current home for a profit, relocating to a less expensive market or seeking out cooperative living situations with other retired couples.\n\nIf you’re keen on staying where you are, you can make living there less expensive by getting the best deal on home insurance.\n\nOfficialHomeInsurance's digital insurance marketplace compiles the best home insurance rates for your unique needs. In just two minutes OfficialHomeInsurance will round up a list of offers from leading insurers, potentially saving you saving you an average of $482 a year.\n\nIf you aren’t working as much – or at all – you might want to swap the car for public transit or a bicycle. Transportation is the second-largest spending category, making up $9,033 in annual expenses for retirees, according to CE figures.\n\nIf your partner has a car, consider getting rid of one vehicle to cut costs. Even if you own your auto outright, car insurance, maintenance and repair costs for two cars add up.\n\nWhether you keep multiple cars or just have one, you want to make sure you’re not overpaying for car insurance.\n\nIn just two minutes, you could find rates as low as $29 per month.\n\nHealth spending makes up $8,027 in annual spending for retirees. One way to cut costs when health issues arise is to get easily affordable preventative care. That means staying up to date on screenings and vaccinations.",

    "fullText": "MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A Wisconsin judge on Tuesday refused to step aside as requested by President Donald Trump's former attorney who faces felony forgery case related to the 2020 election in the battleground state.\n\nThe judge also refused to cancel a Monday preliminary hearing for Trump's former attorney, who also previously worked as a judge in the same county where he is being prosecuted, and two other former Trump associates.\n\nThe three former Trump aides face 11 felony charges each in relation to their roles in the 2020 fake elector scheme. They are: Jim Troupis, who was Trump’s attorney in Wisconsin in the 2020 election; Kenneth Chesebro, an attorney who advised Trump's campaign; and Mike Roman, Trump’s director of Election Day operations in 2020.\n\nTroupis, joined by the other two defendants, argued in a motion filed Monday that all of the judges in Dane County were biased against him. Troupis was a judge in the county for one year from 2015 to 2016.\n\nHe also alleged that the judge hearing his case, Dane County Circuit Judge John Hyland, had solicited help from a retired judge in writing an August order refusing to dismiss the case against him.\n\nTroupis argued in the motion that the retired judge who “carries personal animus” toward Troupis from their time together on the bench actually wrote the order. Troupis asked for an evidentiary hearing in another county.\n\nHe included an expert analysis of the writing style that compares the order to the writing style of retired Dane County Judge Frank Remington. Troupis' attorney also attached a Nov. 25 letter he wrote to Hyland claiming that other attorneys told him that Remington actually wrote the August order because the writing style matched Remington’s in a civil case they litigated before him.\n\nHyland rejected those arguments and Troupis' call for moving the case to another county.\n\n“The Court is satisfied that no person other the assigned staff attorney and I had a hand in drafting or editing the decision which this Court signed and entered,” Hyland wrote.\n\nHyland also wrote that he had “no personal animus or prejudice toward any of the litigants” and was satisfied that he could fairly hear the case. He declined to step aside as requested.\n\nHyland also said that Troupis presented no evidence to support his claim that every other judge in the country was prejudiced against him and therefore can’t fairly hear the case.\n\nTroupis’ attorney, Joe Bugni, did not respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nTroupis, Chesebro and Roman each face 11 felony charges for allegedly using forgery in an attempt to defraud each of the 10 Republican electors who cast their ballots for Trump in 2020 as part of a plan to submit paperwork falsely claiming that the Republican had won the battleground state that year.\n\nTrump lost Wisconsin in 2020 but fought to have the defeat overturned. He won the state in both 2016 and 2024.\n\nThe Wisconsin Department of Justice, which is prosecuting the case, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nThe state charges against the Trump attorneys and aide are the only ones in Wisconsin. None of the electors have been charged. The 10 Wisconsin electors, Chesebro and Troupis all settled a lawsuit that was brought against them in 2023.\n\nFederal prosecutors who investigated Trump’s conduct related to the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, said the fake electors scheme originated in Wisconsin.\n\nThe Wisconsin complaint details how Troupis, Chesebro and Roman created a document that falsely said Trump had won Wisconsin’s 10 Electoral College votes and then attempted to deliver the document to then-Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nThe Trump associates have argued that no crime took place. But the judge in August rejected their arguments in allowing the case to proceed.\n\nA judge threw out a similar case in Michigan in September. And last year, a special prosecutor dropped a federal case alleging Trump conspired to overturn the 2020 election. A Georgia election interference case was dropped by prosecutors earlier last month, and another similar case remains in Nevada.",

    "title": "The Out-of-Touch Adults' Guide to Kid Culture: 'Millennial Optimism'",
    "description": "Young people are longing for the good old days of 2012.",
    "fullText": "This week, young people are longing for a past they were barely alive for, roasting people who dare to read books in public, and sharing videos of the last moments their lives made sense. So, not exactly an uplifting collection of cultural observations, but I threw in some truly banger Christmas carol mashups to lighten the mood. Everything is nostalgic, melancholic, or festive—sometimes all at once.\n\nNostalgia for Y2K is dying out, replaced by romanticization of the years around 2010, which some younger people are imagining as a more innocent, hopeful time that they missed out on. At the same time, many millennials who were setting those trends then are feeling nostalgic for their lost youth, so both groups are posting TikTok videos about \"millennial optimism.\" You see, supposedly post-2010 was an era marked by whimsical possibility and confidence in a bright future, which is decidedly not how kids feel today. Thus: Nostalgia.\n\nHere are some examples of videos about the time, one made by a young person:\n\nSo is \"millennial optimism\" really a thing? Yes and no. While it's hard for an older person to see a decade that included both the fallout from the 2008 recession and the election of 2016 as the best of times, a youth living through our current nightmare might see it that way. And I'm sure many millennial hipsters were having a lovely time back in the late-aughts and teens, growing funny mustaches, going to farmer's markets, and listening to Stomp Clap Hey music.\n\nBut whatever fun and whimsy was on order back then wasn't because of some overall cultural optimism; it was because that's when millennials were young, and it's fun to be young. Also, the urban hipsters at the center of these memes were only a tiny percentage of the population; everyone else was just living their lives—which were, more or less, the same lives people have always led. Anyway, if young people you know start talking about the golden age of optimism that was 2010-2020, this is the context behind their understanding of the recent past. It's flawed, but nostalgia for times we didn't live always is.\n\nThe rise of the term \"performative reading\" could be seen as an indicator that the recent past was actually more optimistic. Performative reading was coined around 2020 and originally referred to people who read books in public as a social status indicator. You might know it better as “acting pretentious” or “being a pseudo intellectual.” As an insult toward people who use books as fashion accessories, \"performative reading\" wasn’t widely employed back then, but lately, the term is being connected to the insult “performative male,” and is often used to refer to young men who read books written by women authors in public in an attempt to get women to notice/like them. I don't think this actually a widespread trend—it feels like one of those things that is commented upon more often than actually happens. Regardless, the result is the worst type of people posting photos (that I won't link to) of \"performative readers\" they spot on subways and coffeeshops, so other horrible people can comment like, \"look at this jerk, readin' a book! Written by a woman!\"\n\nThis is troubling on many levels—it’s anti-intellectual, it's sexist, it's bullying, and it’s also part of a larger trend among generations Z and A, who seem reluctant to do anything out-of-the-ordinary for fear of being publicly judged and/or ridiculed for it online. Before everything was online, you could sit at a coffeeshop reading bell hooks and the worst you might have to deal with would have been a smirk from a stranger. Now, a picture of you in a beret could end up online with a hundreds of thousands of faceless strangers dunking on your pretentious ass. The result is a drop in the number of annoying urban attention seekers, but also a drop in the number of people who do anything interesting at all. So maybe nostalgia for the aughts antwenty-d teens is warranted.\n\nIn Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, the main character chases after a white rabbit and is led into a surreal, troubling world. That's the basis of the White Rabbit trend on TikTok. The idea is to post a video of yourself experiencing a moment of happiness right before the \"white rabbit\" appeared to change the trajectory of your life. It's the calm before the storm, the tragic equivalent of the \"photo taken moments before disaster\" meme, but with the confessional intimacy of TikTok. The melancholic mood is driven home by a soundtrack of a metronome counting down, accompanied by a baleful lo-fi piano riff.\n\nHere's an example, in which a TikToker posted a graduation walk, taken two days before her white rabbit showed up in the form of a serious car accident.\n\nMany white rabbit videos don't offer any context, leaving you to fill in the blanks:\n\nIt's not exactly an uplifting trend, but if you like the camaraderie of knowing you're not the only person whose life has been suddenly uprooted by forces beyond your control, you can check out over 200,000 videos that use the \"white rabbit\" audio.\n\nBack in my day, \"hemmy\" was a word gearheads used to describe the engines in Ram trucks, but among a growing number of young people, \"hemmy\" now means \"homie,\" but as said by a white person. The originator of the word is Milk, a fan-favorite character in Legends of Chamberlain Heights, an \"edgy,\" crudely animated cartoon that premiered on Comedy Central in 2016 and ran for two seasons.\n\nIt's Christmas, so let's check out some Christmas carols that are going viral. TikTok DJ Noteliwood is blowing up (as they used to say) for his holiday-themed mash-ups, like this collision of \"Linus and Lucy\" from the Vince Guaraldi Trio and and GloRilla's \"Yeah Glo!\" that I cannot stop listening to (along with 3.3 million other people):\n\nIf that's not enough to get you in the Christmas spirit, how about \"Money in the Sleigh,\" a mashup of Wham!'s \"Last Christmas\" and Drake's \"Money in the Grave\" that's closing in on four million streams:",

    "title": "Instagram May Be Quietly Adding AI-Generated Headlines to Your Posts",
    "description": "No one asked for this.",
    "fullText": "Few of us are under the illusion that we own the content that we post on Instagram, but we do get a say in how that content is presented—w can choose which photos and videos we share, what captions appear (or don't appear) on each post, as well as whether or not we include where the image was taken or shared from. We might not control the platform, but we do control the content of our posts—unless those posts are found on search engines like Google.\n\nAs reported by 404 Media, it appears that Instagram is experimenting with AI-generated SEO titles for users' posts—without those users' input or permission. Take this post for example: Author Jeff VanderMeer uploaded a short video of rabbits eating a banana to his Instagram. The video was posted as-is: There was no caption, location tag, or any other public-facing information. It's just a couple of rabbits having a bite.\n\nA post shared by Jeff VanderMeer (@jeff_vandermeer123)\n\nInstagram, however, took it upon itself to add a headline to the post—at least when you stumble upon it on via Google. Rather than display a link featuring Jeff's Instagram handle and some metadata about the video, the Google entry comes back with the following headline: \"Meet the Bunny Who Loves Eating Bananas, A Nutritious Snack for...\" (the rest of the headline cuts off here).\n\nVanderMeer was less than pleased with the discovery. He posted a screenshot of the headline to Bluesky, writing, \"now [Instagram] appears to generate titles [and] headlines via AI for stuff I post...to create [clickbait] for [Google] wtf do not like.\"\n\nThis was not the only AI-generated headline VanderMeer was roped into. This post from the Groton Public Library in Massachusetts, which advertises VanderMeer's novel Annihilation as the library's December book group pick, was also given the \"clickbait\" treatment on Google. Just as with VanderMeer's post, the Groton Public Library didn't include any text in its Instagram post—just an image showing off the book. But if you see the post within a Google search, you'll see the following partial headline: \"Join Jeff VanderMeer on a Thrilling Beachside Adventure with Mesta...\"\n\n404 Media's Emanuel Maiberg says that they've confirmed that Instagram is also generating headlines for other users on the platform, all without permission or knowledge. Meta did not return 404 Media's request for comment. (I have also reached out for comment.) Google, on the other hand, did return 404 Media's messages, and confirmed the headlines are not coming from its AI generators—though it has been using deceptive AI-generated headlines of its own on Google Discover. In fact, the company says its search engine is simply pulling the text from Instagram itself. Maiberg found that these headlines do appear under title tags for Instagram posts when using Google's Rich Result Test tool. When digging through the code, Maiberg also discovered AI-generated descriptions for each post, which could be what Instagram is ultimately using to generate the headlines.\n\nI'll update this post if I hear back from Instagram regarding these AI-generated headlines. Until then, I can only speculate on their intended purpose (assuming Instagram is the one generating these headlines in the first place). And the likeliest reason is to boost engagement: Instagram probably wants to increase the visibility of its users' posts in search, which means giving Google more information to work with. If the user doesn't provide their own details about the image, Instagram's AI appears to be filling in the blanks, first generating a description, and from there, sticking a \"clicky\" headline onto it.\n\nThe results aren't actually all that appealing, though. Just because Meta AI may be capable of generating headlines, doesn't mean it is good at it, or even that it should—especially when users never consented to this practice in the first place. It'd be one thing if Instagram had an option before you post—something like \"Generate a headline for me using Meta AI that will appear in search engines for my post.\" Most of us would opt out of that, but it'd at least be a choice. However, it appears that Instagram decided that users like VanderMeer weren't capable of writing a headline as clever as \"Meet the Bunny Who Loves Eating Bananas.\"\n\nThe worst part is, the AI doesn't even accurately describe the posts. That Groton Public Library post was only about a book club meeting featuring VanderMeer's novel, but the headline says \"Join Jeff VanderMeer,\" as if he'd be making an appearance. Not only did Instagram add a headline without VanderMeer's consent, it spread misinformation about his whereabouts. And for what? Some extra engagement on Google?\n\nIf Instagram wants its posts to appear as headlines on search engines, it should include the actual posters in the conversation. As VanderMeer told 404 Media: \"If I post content, I want to be the one contextualizing it, not some third party.\"",

    "description": "“I am currently saving this money for him.”",
    "fullText": "Instead of giving my son a portion of some rental property I own 50/50 with my daughter,  I promised to give him $250,000 instead as an inheritance before I die.  The reason was simple: my son had no financial input into that property,\n\nI am currently saving this money for him. When the amount accrues to $250,000, including interest, do I give him that money or should he have the $250,000, plus whatever interest is paid? Obviously, I prefer the former scenario.\n\nNvidia’s stock rises as Trump blesses China sales. Here’s how big the opportunity could be.\n\nMy mother is selling my late father’s multimillion-dollar California real-estate portfolio — must I stand idly by?\n\nI’m desperately trying to do right by everyone. How do I make up for the equity in the property?\n\nIt may never be entirely equal. Whatever you decide, put it in writing.\n\nYour daughter invested in a house and, as you say, brought some of her own money. The house, given the long-term trajectory of the housing market, will increase in value. Your son has an opportunity to invest this $250,000 in the stock market or, perhaps, use it as seed money to buy a property of his own.\n\nIf you want to make sure each child gets exactly the same inheritance, down to the last red cent, you could give him the monetary equivalent of your share of the rental property, and allow your daughter to own the home outright. Forcing your daughter into becoming a joint landlord with her brother against her wishes and/or without her knowledge would be a weird flex, if you can afford to give your son the cash equivalent.\n\nThe clue is in your question: If the agreement was “I will give you $250,000…” then you should indeed gift him $250,000, with no additional interest on top. The interest is simply a method for you to accumulate the pledged amount. You are not functioning as a bank, and unless you promised him interest, he is not entitled to any. Ultimately, you want to ensure that they each receive a similar gift and/or inheritance.\n\nImagine you had entered into this real-estate transaction in 2009 and gifted your son $250,000. He would have made out like a bandit, given the fall in property prices, which took the best part of a decade to recover. You’re a generous parent, not a Federal Reserve committee member or a Nobel Prize-winning economist — and certainly not a fortune teller. Sometimes, non-cash inheritances leave a lot up to chance.",

    "description": "An infographics feature has arrived to Google's NotebookLM.",
    "fullText": "Another day, another update to Google's NotebookLM, the versatile AI tool that functions like a personal assistant focused only on you and your needs. The latest update is for visual learners: You can turn your source materials into helpful infographics that give you a clear picture—literally—of what the PDFs, websites, videos, or other materials you're studying or organizing are about.\n\nTo use the new feature, open any of your NotebookLM Notebooks (the name given to folders full of specific materials you've uploaded) and navigate to the panel on the right side. It's the same panel where you find the other offerings like the video creator and flashcard maker.\n\nAs with those tools, you just tap the associated button to generate the corresponding product, making sure the sources from your left panel that you want to include are all checked off. I tried it out this morning, first using the NotebookLM account associated with my personal Chrome profile and what I'm studying in my private life, then using the one I have set up for work, which has a tester notebook full of materials about how to study for the SAT. (I am strict about using different Chrome profiles for various parts of my life and am now up to seven.)\n\nIn my personal account, the button was labeled BETA—and it acted like it. After two failed attempts, NotebookLM could not produce an infographic based on my materials. In my work account, though, the beta label was missing and it performed the function just fine, spitting this out:\n\nThis is rolling out in full functionality to accounts at different times, obviously, but I was glad to see one of mine had easy access because I thought the infographic was solid.\n\nI don't consider myself a visual learner and primarily use NotebookLM to refine ideas or generate educational audio clips I can listen to while I clean the house, so I wasn't expecting to like this. I don't like the mind map creator within NotebookLM at all, for instance; flowcharts just aren't how I learn best, and that's fine.\n\nBut the infographic was concise, engaging, and just detailed enough to keep me interested and looking at it. It's unlikely I'll use this to study or refine my work often, but I can absolutely see how it would be useful to someone who learns more visually, especially if all the lines and boxes of a mind map can get too convoluted to be useful.",

Governor would be a disservice to both my constituents and the thousands of hardworking Georgians who have pledged their support for our vision,” Republican state Sen. John Kennedy said in a statement.\n\nThe Macon lawyer, who was elected president pro tem by his GOP colleagues in 2023, joined a crowded GOP field for lieutenant governor in June.\n\nAside from being unable to campaign full-time, if he kept serving the state Senate, Kennedy would not be allowed to raise campaign funds during the legislative session that typically runs from January to April. His resignation is effective immediately.\n\nDemocratic gubernatorial candidate Jason Esteves of Atlanta, a former state senator, was the first lawmaker running for statewide office in 2026 to step down.\n\nGov. Brian Kemp will call a special election to fill the seat in Senate District 18, which includes parts of Macon-Bibb county in middle Georgia, but that election will likely happen during the state's legislative session.\n\nBurt Jones, the current Republican lieutenant governor, is running for governor next year instead of seeking reelection.\n\nKennedy is banking on the support of Georgia’s business community after helping pass a law this year limiting lawsuits and civil verdicts. He was first elected to the state Senate in 2014.\n\nKennedy faces Georgia Senate Majority Leader Steve Gooch and state Sens. Greg Dolezal and Blake Tillery along with Rep. David Clark in the GOP primary. Democrat state Sen. Josh McLaurin is so far the only Democrat in the lieutenant governor race.\n\nKramon is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

    "fullText": "Mikel Arteta says Arsenal are caught in a \"really dangerous circle\" with injuries - but denied they are a result of overtraining.\n\nArsenal have suffered injuries to a number of key players throughout the season and will be without midfielder Declan Rice, defender William Saliba and forward Leandro Trossard for the match against Club Brugge in the league phase of the Champions League on Wednesday.\n\nTrossard, who scored in the loss to Aston Villa at the weekend, only just returned from injury but was brought off before the end of the game despite only being introduced as a second-half substitute.\n\nArsenal are still without forward Kai Havertz and defenders Gabriel Magalhaes and Cristhian Mosquera, while striker Viktor Gyokeres is just returning from injury.\n\nThe Gunners have also made a change to their Champions League squad because of injury, with Gabriel Jesus, who has been out since January after cruciate ligament surgery, replacing 15-year-old Max Dowman - who picked up his injury playing for Arsenal Under-21s in a friendly against Manchester United on Saturday.\n\nBut when asked if overtraining was the cause of the problems, Arteta rejected the idea.\n\n\"No, because we don't train.\" Arteta said referring to the short turnaround between games at this point in the season before saying his side trained for \"20 minutes\" on Tuesday.\n\n\"We don't have time to train. So training is not there but obviously the fact that you are missing players, you are loading other players more [as] a consequence. It's a really dangerous circle that one.\"\n\nArsenal also had to deal with long-term injuries to Havertz and Bukayo Saka last season, while centre-back Gabriel missed an important couple of months at the end of the last campaign.\n\nAnd Arteta said that alongside the Arsenal medical team he was always looking at the reasons for the injuries they suffer.\n\n\"Some of the players have played over 150 games in two seasons so it starts to get overloaded. You start to ask them again and again and again to do that [and] at some point they will break down,\" he said.\n\n\"It's something that we are constantly looking at. We have played a lot of games with a lot of players missing that puts a lot of stress and then more injuries but we are on it.\n\n\"I'm really happy what we're doing in terms of the medical stuff and everything that we are trying to bring together, but sometimes as well we need some things to go on our side.\"",

    "description": "The earthquakes are not believed to be connected. But they are a reminder of lurking danger.",
    "fullText": "Two earthquakes of a 7.0 or greater magnitude have struck within days of each other in Alaska and Japan, prompting worries another big temblor could be on the way.\n\nThe first quake hit in Alaska on Dec. 6 with a magnitude of 7.0, a major quake capable of producing serious damage if it hadn't happened in such a remote area near the Canada border. The second, a 7.6 mega-quake, hit northern Japan on Dec. 8, prompting tsunami warnings that were later lifted and causing at least 30 injuries. Tens of thousands evacuated their homes.\n\nAftershocks have been recorded for both earthquakes. On Dec. 8, Japanese authorities warned an even more powerful earthquake could strike within the next week and called on residents from the northernmost island of Hokkaido down to Chiba prefecture, east of Tokyo, to be on high alert.\n\nThe earthquakes were notable for their strength.\n\nIn an average year, the U.S. Geological Survey says about 16 major earthquakes are expected around the world, including 15 with a magnitude of 7.0 or higher and one 8.0 or higher. That's based on records dating back to about 1900. For the last four to five decades, the long-term average number of major quakes in a year has been surpassed about a dozen times.\n\nBut having two such quakes in a short period of time happens from time-to-time and doesn't necessarily signal another impending disaster.\n\n\"It's not all the time, but it's not that crazy,\" said Brandon Schmandt, professor at Rice University and seismology expert.\n\nIt's a reminder of an uncomfortable truth in earthquake science: Scientists know disastrous earthquakes are looming, but have no reliable way to predict when they will hit.\n\n\"No one can predict earthquakes. However, by investigating faults and past quakes, scientists can better assess the likelihood of future earthquakes and how intense their shaking might be,\" the USGS said.\n\n\"We average about one magnitude-7.0 per month somewhere in the world,\" Jones said.\n\nThe average of one per month is randomly distributed, Jones said. We might go several months without one, and then see multiple within a close span. Jones said she would estimate based on probabilities that paired magnitude-7 or higher earthquakes are likely to come within half a week of each other once every few years.\n\n\"It's not like it happens all the time, but we've looked for and can't find any physical correlation,\" she said.\n\nOne earthquake can trigger another, as in an aftershock, but that's not the relationship between the Alaska and Japan quakes, which appear to be wholly unrelated, Schmandt said. Aftershocks tend to happen in the same geographic area as the main earthquake.\n\nJones said there is about a 5% chance after any earthquake that another one will follow nearby within a few days that is bigger in magnitude. Though a 5% chance might not seem like much, it's a much greater than the baseline chances, and it's what's driving Japanese authorities to stay on high alert for the time being, she said.\n\nA recent example happened in 2019 near Ridgecrest, California, Jones noted. A 6.4-magnitude hit on the Fourth of July, and less intense aftershocks followed. Then, one day later, a 7.1 quake became the largest to strike Southern California in 20 years.\n\nMost of the United States is at risk for damaging earthquake shaking within the next century, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, which published a report last year that found hundreds of previously unidentified faults around the country.\n\nPeople in 37 states have experienced earthquakes with magnitudes of 5.0 or greater in the last two centuries, according to the USGS.\n\nThe danger is most concentrated along the West Coast and the southern part of Alaska, where the most active tectonic plate boundaries are found.\n\nConcerns of a so-called \"Big One\" event, a massive quake bringing untold devastation, have long rattled residents in these areas. It could happen at any time, or not for a long time, experts say. And there could be more than one \"Big One.\"\n\nThe Big One: Is California 'overdue' for a devastating major earthquake?\n\nSchmandt said the Cascadia Subduction Zone that stretches from Northern California up through Oregon and Washington and into Canada has the potential for a lurking event that could be considered \"the Big One.\" The last known quake in this fault happened in January 1700, with an estimated 9.0 magnitude, according to the Oregon Department of Emergency Management.\n\n\"Currently, scientists are predicting that there is about a 37% chance that a megathrust earthquake of 7.1+ magnitude in this fault zone will occur in the next 50 years. This event will be felt throughout the Pacific Northwest,\" the department said.\n\nAccording to Michigan Technological University, earthquake magnitudes can have the following effects:\n\n5.5 to 6.0: Slight damage to buildings\n\n7.0 to 7.9: Major earthquake. Serious damage\n\n8.0 or greater: Massive damage, can destroy communities\n\nContributing: Elizabeth Weise and Terry Collins, USA TODAY; Reuters\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Are the Alaska, Japan earthquakes a warning?",

    "fullText": "Who knows what the narrative would have been had Dominik Szoboszlai not converted from the penalty spot?\n\nThe noise surrounding Mohamed Salah would only have gotten louder. More dropped points for Liverpool without their star man.\n\nYet it was Liverpool's player of the season so far who took the responsibility from 12 yards out while the man who would have usually taken the penalty sat at home, almost 1000 miles away.\n\nThe sight of the players walking over to the away end and the travelling fans singing Arne Slot's name at the full-time whistle told you all you needed to know.\n\nAfter a horrid few days, Slot and Liverpool finally had something to smile about.\n\nThis was their fourth win at the San Siro in as many years but crucially their first away win in the Champions League without Salah since 2009.\n\nWhether or not it is a turning point for Slot and co remains to be seen but it certainly felt massive. Not least with Michael Edwards, the chief executive, in attendance in Milan.\n\nOn Monday, goalkeeper Alisson Becker insisted that the players were behind the manager after arguably the toughest spell of his career.\n\nOn the pitch, they delivered with an assured display after Slot's tactical tweaks and crucially kept a clean sheet following the capitulation at Leeds on Saturday.\n\nAbove all, the spirit and togetherness after a tumultuous 72 hours was notable. Liverpool travelled to Italy with a depleted 19-man squad and got the job done.\n\n\"It doesn't change anything. There's obviously so much noise from the outside world, which is normal when you don't perform,\" Virgil van Dijk told Amazon Prime Sport.\n\n\"It's deserved as well. We want to improve, we want to be consistent and win games. We're not doing it as much as we like. We have to stick together and be a unit as we have been. That's what Liverpool stands for.\n\nLeft-back Andy Robertson added: \"We all needed it. We know the results and performances aren't good enough. It's important that this club is in the Champions League. It was a huge result for all of us.\"",

    "fullText": "Son Heung-min, as he did so often in a magnificent Tottenham Hotspur career, arrived on the scene with perfect timing.\n\nThe great South Korean, who scored 173 goals in 454 games for Spurs, was back at the club for the first time since leaving for Los Angeles FC in the summer.\n\nIt was fitting that it was a big European night that marked the return of the talisman who played a key role when Spurs reached the Champions League Final in 2019 and made his farewell appearance as captain when they won their first trophy for 17 years by beating Manchester United in the Europa League Final in Bilbao last season.\n\nAn emotional Son addressed Spurs fans before kick-off, receiving a predictably rapturous reception, before watching Thomas Frank's team take another important step forward with a comfortable Champions League win against Slavia Prague.\n\nIt was almost as if Spurs were fated to deliver in the presence of one of their modern greats, who went to view a mural painted in his honour before kick-off having been unable to say goodbye when he left for the United States.\n\nSon's presence added a feel-good factor in an environment that has endured its share of toxicity this season as Frank has struggled to convince Spurs fans of his suitability to tackle a more high-profile task than at previous club Brentford.\n\nAnd there is no doubt this has been a vital week for Frank, whose short spell at Spurs hit a low after the recent defeat at home to Fulham, when he publicly criticised those who jeered keeper Guglielmo Vicario after a mistake led to a goal as \"not true Tottenham fans.\"\n\nThis is a high-risk, high stakes strategy. Frank needed results to back up that sort of confrontational talk and in the last three games Spurs have delivered.",

    "description": "The Fed's final meeting of 2025 is expected to see a third interest rate cut from the central bank, with investors focusing on the outlook for 2026.",
    "fullText": "The Federal Reserve's final meeting of the year began on Tuesday morning, Dec. 9, with the central bank scheduled to announce its final monetary policy decision at 2:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nInvestors expect the Fed will cut rates by 0.25%, its third cut of the year, at the conclusion of its two-day meeting, with data from the CME Group showing a 90% chance the central bank will cut rates this week.\n\nAlong with its final policy decision of the year, the Fed will also publish its final Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) for 2025, which includes forecasts from Fed officials on economic growth, inflation, and interest rates for the coming years.\n\nIn September, the SEP showed the Fed's median forecasts calling for just one interest rate cut in 2026 following three reductions in 2025. Changes to this outlook will be top of mind for investors on Wednesday.\n\nInvestors will also be closely watching for further disagreement among Fed officials, as October's policy statement revealed two members of the FOMC voted against the decision to lower rates by 0.25%.\n\nUS stocks were little changed at Tuesday's close as traders bet that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to CME Group's FedWatch tool, traders assigned a 87.6% probability to the Fed cutting rates by 25 basis points, down marginally from odds placed on a cut a day ago.\n\nAlthough stocks were muted in the lead-up to the Fed decision, one strategist noted that Chair Jerome Powell's comments at the press conference will likely affect market sentiment heading into 2026.\n\n“A 25 basis point cut is important for investor sentiment, not necessarily for many of the companies that we invest in,\" Siebert Financial chief investment officer Mark Malek told Yahoo Finance about how the Fed decision could affect investments. \"This 25 basis points is not going to make or break a lot of these companies.\"\n\nBarring a major deterioration in the labor market, Malek expects the Fed to try to temper expectations for further rate cuts. That's why Powell's remarks on the labor market will be especially scrutinized, he said.\n\n\"It is important that the Fed is showing that they're concerned about the labor market,\" Malek said. \"It's good for the consumer to know that the Fed's got their backs, if people are worried about their jobs, or maybe they're going to pull back on spending after the holiday season.\"\n\nThe Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower short-term interest rates on Wednesday for the third time this year, affecting the interest consumers pay and receive on many of their accounts.\n\nYahoo Finance's Hal Bundrick breaks down how discounts to the federal funds rate will impact deposits, credit, and debt:\n\n2025 has been a year of modest earnings on deposit accounts. Another rate cut won't help.\n\nThe national average of interest paid on checking accounts has barely budged much this year and remains at 0.07%. Interest rates on savings accounts are only marginally better, remaining at 0.40%.\n\nImagine that moving even lower. Is it possible? Yes.\n\nStock prices often react to the Fed’s rate actions, but they are only one factor among many affecting the investing climate and stock prices.\n\nIf you intend to manage your investments to suit the current environment, keep watch on broader economic and corporate profit trends alongside interest rates. If you prefer to stay conservative, fill your portfolio with high-quality stocks that have proven themselves in all economic cycles.\n\nThen, wait patiently for long-term growth.\n\nRead more about how the Fed affects your money here.\n\nAs markets look ahead to the path of Federal Reserve policy in 2026, President Trump offered one clue in an interview with Politico released Tuesday.\n\nTrump responded “yes” when asked if quickly reducing interest rates would be a litmus test for his choice of central bank leader. Trump has a list of five candidates to replace current Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whose term expires in May 2026.\n\n“Yes. Well, this guy ... should too,” Trump said, referring to Powell. “I think he’s a combination of not a smart person and doesn’t like Trump.”\n\nStocks were muted at the market open on Tuesday after a Federal Reserve spokesperson confirmed the FOMC meeting was underway.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was flat and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.2%. All three indexes came off modest losses on Monday.\n\nTreasury yields steadied as investors awaited the release of jobs data and the Federal Open Market Committee's policy decision.\n\nThe benchmark 10-year yield (^TNX) fell 2 basis points to 4.14%. Meanwhile, the 30-year yield (^TYX) declined 3 basis points to 4.78% after hitting its highest level in about three months on Monday.\n\nRead more about today's market action here.\n\nThe consensus around the Federal Reserve’s policy move on Wednesday has firmed around a 25 basis point rate cut — even if the decision will be a close one, as Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger details.\n\nTraders are pricing in an 89% chance that the Fed lowers interest rates by 25 basis points at the conclusion of the FOMC meeting on Wednesday, according to CMEGroup's FedWatch.\n\nBut looking ahead to the January meeting and 2026 broadly, the path is even less certain.\n\nOne widely held view is that the Fed will move forward with a \"hawkish cut\" on Wednesday, in which the central bank lowers rates but hints at a pause in January, JPMorgan’s Michael Feroli wrote in a Dec. 5 note. Traders have put a 23% probability that the Federal Reserve will continue cutting rates at its Jan. 27-28 meeting.\n\n“At the press conference, we expect that Powell will stress that with policy rates close to neutral, the time for risk management cuts is past and that further cuts would only come with a material deterioration in the labor market,” Feroli wrote.\n\n\"We don’t expect him to comment directly on January,\" Feroli added, \"but instead to highlight that there is a lot of data to be released between now and the January meeting and that will guide their decision.\"\n\nFor the remainder of the year, views range from the Fed cutting rates at its next few policy meetings due to a deterioration in the labor market to additional rate cuts in the summer due to a change in Fed leadership.\n\nRead more about 2026 predictions for Federal Reserve policy here.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's eventful 2025 wraps up this week, and another 0.25% rate cut is expected.\n\nBut the real drama in the central bank's release will be in how much agreement, or not, there is with this decision.\n\nAs Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger noted in her preview of the event, at least three regional Fed presidents have signaled that the case for cutting rates this week does not appear obvious. One of those includes Kansas City Fed president Jeff Schmid, who voted against October's rate cut.\n\nAdd in that Fed Governor Stephen Miran has twice dissented in favor of a larger rate cut, the central bank could be looking at upward of four votes against the expected decision to lower rates by another 0.25% on Wednesday.\n\nRead Jennifer's full preview of the meeting here.",

    "description": "Eden Castleberry has sued Indian Hill schools alleging that her 9-year-old son was racially harassed and ultimately attacked on a school playground.",
    "fullText": "The mother of an Indian Hill Elementary School student who filed a federal lawsuit alleging that her son was racially harassed and beaten by a handful of students was barred from school property hours after a meeting that led the school's principal to call police, according to public records obtained by The Enquirer.\n\nPolice reports say the directive prohibiting Eden Castleberry from being on any school property without prior authorization was the result of \"multiple incidents\" during which she acted \"in an aggressive and inappropriate manner” toward staff.\n\nBut Castleberry's attorney said the police reports are not accurate.\n\n\"Eden has no history of aggressive behavior with the district or law enforcement and has never even received a warning,\" her attorney, Robert Thompson, said in an emailed response to questions.\n\n\"Any suggestion that her presence that morning was an 'in person confrontation' that justified banning her from school property misstates her conduct and the context,\" Thompson said. \"We are concerned that the school district’s response was not driven by any aggressive behavior by Eden, but rather is consistent with retaliation after she raised safety concerns and advocated for her son and other children.\"\n\nCastelberry's lawsuit, filed Nov. 19 against the district, Indian Hill Football Club and numerous school staff, says that her son, Will J, was racially harassed, ambushed after a football practice and then, on Oct. 28, attacked, called racial slurs and injured by several students on a school playground.\n\nTwo days after the playground incident, Castleberry went to the school. Thompson said that a social worker and others at Cincinnati Children's, where Will J was treated for a concussion, bruised ribs and wrists, among other injuries, told Castleberry \"that she needed to go to the school in order to press charges regarding the attack on her son.\"\n\nThe police reports, which The Enquirer obtained through a public records request, indicate that the school's principal, Whitney Buell, called police about \"an upset parent\" the morning of Oct. 30 after Castleberry went to the school.\n\nSometime after 9 a.m. that day, Indian Hill officers were directed to a conference room where Castleberry was talking to the district’s chief human resources officer.\n\nIndian Hill Officer Ryan Camardo told Castleberry, according to the reports, “We (will) not be arresting 9-year-olds” because they were too young.\n\nCastleberry \"disagreed,\" according to the reports, and said her attorney had told her charges should be filed.\n\nCamardo then contacted the assistant prosecutor at the Hamilton County Prosecutor’s Office who heads the juvenile division. According to the reports, Assistant Prosecutor Linda Scott said children that young cannot have criminal intent “and confirmed that the children involved would not be charged.\"\n\nThe reports say a school district official told Castleberry that the school “imposed appropriate disciplinary action” against the students involved.\n\nBut according to Thompson, Castleberry arrived at the school around 8:30 a.m., and she asked police to be present \"because her sole purpose was to file the report and then leave.\"\n\n\"Her goal was to seek appropriate accountability for what happened to her child, not to create a confrontation,\" Thompson said.\n\nTexts obtained through a public records request show that Buell filed an internal report about Castleberry's Oct. 30 visit to the school. In the text exchange with an unnamed person, Buell said she would not get \"into the weeds of the fight\" involving Will J in the report.\n\nBuell, who is listed as a defendant in the federal lawsuit, also said none of the kids the district identified as being involved in the attack would be named in the report she made Oct. 30.\n\nThat same day, Castleberry was formally barred from all Indian Hill schools at the request of Superintendent Kirk Koennecke. She is only permitted on school property for drop off and pick up or with prior authorization.\n\nThe timing of the directive froze Castleberry's ability to advocate for her 9-year-old son because of the severity of injuries he got in the October attack, the lawsuit says.\n\nCastleberry said the playground attack was the culmination of more than a year of racially charged harassment against Will J, who is of mixed race.\n\nIt began in the fall of 2024. Three white students, two of whom were the sons of coaches of Will J's club football team, repeatedly called him \"monkey,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\nThen a year later, on Sept. 18, 2025, two of Will J's football teammates, who are white, “ambushed” him after football practice, the lawsuit says. One charged at him and slammed him to the ground; the other grabbed his head and repeatedly slammed it into the ground, then began choking him while he was pinned down.\n\nAmong the claims is that Buell told Castleberry that the school wasn't responsible because the attack happened after practice for a club team not affiliated with the school. The lawsuit also alleges that the club team's coach didn't take appropriate action.\n\nAfter the Sept. 18 incident, Castleberry advertised a \"Protect Your Kids\" protest at a fourth grade football game at Indian Hill High School. According to screenshots of emails and a Facebook post obtained through a public records request, Castleberry said she hoped to expose the district and the football club's efforts to minimize the the incident at practice.\n\n\"This message is to every parent out there. Please protect (your) sons especially at practices. The schools and the clubs should do our children better,\" Castleberry said in an email obtained through a public records request.\n\nThompson said Castleberry organized the protest because she had become extremely concerned about student safety in the district \"and what she perceived as an inadequate response to serious issues affecting children.\n\n\"The purpose was to raise awareness and to advocate for better protection of students,\" he said. \"It was focused on safety and accountability for children, not on personal attacks against staff.\"\n\nCastleberry has been active in the district as a parent, serving as a chaperone on class trips and coaching recreational basketball, according to Thompson. She also runs a youth basketball program.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cincinnati Enquirer: Indian Hill schools barred mom for her response to her son's attack",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had no time to hold a traditional news conference during a whirlwind, 36-hour trip across Europe this week, so he improvised.\n\nFor the first time since Russia's full-scale invasion of his country, Zelenskyy — who usually takes reporters’ questions in person while trotting the globe — communicated with the news media via group chat. While flying between London and Brussels, he answered a long list of questions from Ukrainian and international reporters, relaying audio clips on WhatsApp.\n\nHis chosen mode of communication was, if not unprecedented, at the very least extremely rare for a world leader.\n\nThe low drone of the aircraft blended with his hoarse, tired-sounding voice, yet his message cut through clearly: Amid uncertain negotiations to end the war, Ukraine, he said, cannot surrender land.\n\n“Undoubtedly, Russia insists for us to give up territories,” he said in a crackling message late Monday. “According to the law, we don’t have such a right … and to be frank, we don’t have a moral right either.”\n\nWith the outlook for negotiations changing by the day, Zelenskyy’s team set out on a jam-packed schedule to shore up support in Europe.\n\nZelenskyy met the leaders of Britain, Germany and France in London, and the heads of NATO and the European Union in Brussels, before traveling on to Rome for talks with the Italian prime minister and Pope Leo XIV.\n\nA key issue being discussed is whether Ukraine should cede Russian‑occupied territory in return for security guarantees, but the talks have been complicated by uncertainty about the Trump administration’s commitment to European security.\n\nSince the start of the war, Zelenskyy has shown a desire to communicate in real-time in whatever way is necessary.\n\nWhen Kyiv came under siege shortly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, Zelenskyy tried to reassure the public through what appeared to be a cellphone video with three top officials — perhaps his best-known address.\n\n“We are all here,” he said at the time. “Our soldiers are here, the citizens of our country are all here protecting our independence, and we are going to continue to do so.”\n\nSince then, Zelenskyy has made frequent communication a strategic priority in a sleep-defying cycle of video messages, remote speeches to Western parliaments and conferences, late-night posts and high-security public appearances.\n\nMonday night’s WhatsApp exchange wound down as his plane landed in Brussels, just before he was whisked into his next round of meetings.\n\nHe asked reporters: “How did you like this format? If it works for you, then when we have the opportunity, we’ll share our thoughts and decisions this way again.”\n\nIt didn't take long. By Tuesday evening, Zelenskyy had sent reporters more audio messages on WhatsApp to explain how talks to end the war were proceeding with its Western allies.",

    "fullText": "LAS VEGAS (KLAS) — Officials have identified some of the more than 300 piles of cremated remains located in the desert outside of Las Vegas.\n\nThe 8 News Now Investigators first reported the discovery of more than 100 piles of cremated remains in August. The person who found the ashes later contacted 8 News Now and said he stumbled on the piles on July 28 in a desert area outside of Searchlight. Searchlight is a rural community about an hour south of the Las Vegas valley off U.S. 95.\n\nIn August, a Bureau of Land Management official confirmed the piles were human cremains and that the department was actively investigating. “Cremains,” the term the official provided, refers to human cremated remains. What are generally referred to as “ashes” are pulverized bone, which are left over after a person is cremated.\n\nIn late October, representatives from Palm Mortuaries and Cemeteries removed approximately 315 piles from the desert. A second area containing more piles was found near the dump site in the 8 News Now Investigators’ original report.\n\nAs of Wednesday, officials identified three of the 315 piles, officials said. It was unlikely that more identifications would be forthcoming. Officials declined to comment further, citing the open investigation.\n\nThere is no law in Nevada barring a person from scattering ashes on public land. State law requires funeral operators to preserve the “dignity” of any remains in their care. BLM policy allows for a person to scatter cremated remains; however, the policy limits “commercial distribution of cremated remains.” A mass dumping site, like this one, violates federal law.\n\nPalm was in the process of placing the remains in a crypt.\n\nSeveral sources have suggested to the 8 News Now Investigators that the remains came from a recently closed funeral home and that they were years unclaimed. A representative from that business, which is headquartered out of state, has repeatedly denied any involvement.\n\nTips can be submitted to the BLM at blm_law_enforcement@blm.gov.\n\n8 News Now Investigator David Charns can be reached at dcharns@8newsnow.com.",

    "fullText": "King Charles is a step closer to saying goodbye to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s kids before it’s too late.\n\nThe Sun reported on December 7 that Harry had a major win in his ongoing case to restore his security in the United Kingdom after he lost the taxpayer-funded benefit after he and his wife, Meghan Markle, stepped down as senior members of the British royal family and moved to the United States in 2020. According to The Sun, a review of Harry’s security by the official body that assesses how royals and VIPs are guarded is now underway by the U.K. government.\n\nHarry's Ex's Friend Called Their Breakup the 'Best Thing That Ever Happened to Her' Right Before Reports the Prince Saw Her as the '1 Person Who Really Understood' Him\n\nThe Sun also reported that evidence has already been collected by Harry’s team, the police, and the government, and any decision around Harry’s security will be known in January 2026. “The UK Government’s protective security system is rigorous and proportionate. It is our long-standing policy not to provide detailed information on those arrangements, as doing so could compromise their integrity and affect individuals’ security,” a U.K. government spokesperson said in a statement at the time.\n\nThe update means Harry, who has said that he doesn’t feel safe bringing Meghan and his two children, Archie and Lilibet, back to the U.K. unless they had security, is one step closer to reuniting his father, King Charles, with his grandchildren. According to BBC, Charles hasn’t seen Lilibet and Archie in person since the Sussexes’ visit to the U.K. in 2022 for the Platinum Jubilee.\n\nThe update also comes after Charles and Harry reunited for the first time in years during a meeting in September, which was seen as a “massive step” forward in their estrangement, according to People. The update also comes as a source told Us Weekly in December that Charles is viewing his 2025 Christmas celebration as his “last” holiday after he was diagnosed with cancer in 2024.\n\n“Charles prioritizes duty, but he’s also a family man who knows his time is precious,” the insider said. “He wants a special last Christmas in case it’s his last.”\n\nFor Charles’ “last Christmas,” the insider reported that the king planned on taking his St. Mary Magdalene Church on Christmas morning and recording his Christmas speech, which airs later that afternoon to million of listeners. “Nothing would stop Charles from doing that,” the insider said. “He will do everything expected of him and more.” Another source added, “His health isn’t the best. They’re taking it day by day.”\n\n25 Celebrity Couples Who Stayed Together After Cheating Scandals\n\nEvery Celebrity Who Has Hosted the Golden Globes Through the Years\n\n29 Short Celebrity Marriages That Were Over Before They Started",

    "description": "Carrie was married to Mitt's older brother, who filed for divorce months prior to her death",
    "fullText": "The County of Los Angeles Department of Medical Examiner has determined the cause of death for former U.S. Sen Mitt Romney's late sister-in-law, Carrie Elizabeth Romney\n\nCarrie died on Oct. 10 after she fell from a parking garage in California\n\nMitt said in a statement at the time that his family was \"heartbroken\" by her death\n\nA cause of death has been determined for Carrie Elizabeth Romney, the sister-in-law of former U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney.\n\nThe County of Los Angeles Department of Medical Examiner (DME) said on Tuesday, Dec. 9, that they determined Carrie had died as a result of blunt traumatic injuries. She was injured after falling from the roof of a parking garage in Valencia, Calif., on Oct. 10. The DME also noted that Carrie's death was a suicide. She was 64 years old.\n\nA rep for Mitt, 78, did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comment.\n\nA Los Angeles County Sheriff’s representative previously told PEOPLE that law enforcement responded to a call at about 8:30 p.m. PT on the night of Carrie's death and arrived at a Valencia parking garage located at the 24500 block of Town Center Drive, where they identified her body.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Sheriff’s representative told PEOPLE that a woman had jumped or fallen from the parking garage, which is five stories and near a Hyatt Regency hotel, as reported by NBC Los Angeles.\n\nIn a statement shared with PEOPLE shortly after Carrie's death, Mitt said, \"Our family is heartbroken by the loss of Carrie, who brought warmth and love to all our lives. We ask for privacy during this difficult time.\"\n\nMonths before Carrie's death, her husband George \"Scott\" Romney — Mitt's older brother — filed for divorce, according to court documents obtained by PEOPLE.\n\nThe filing showed that Scott, 84, filed on June 10 to divorce Carrie, who was his third wife. The filing cited May 25 as the couple's date of separation and named \"irreconcilable differences\" as the reason for their split.\n\nIn his filing, Scott asked the judge to eliminate potential spousal support for both himself and Carrie during divorce proceedings or at any point in the future. He noted, \"most of the assets and debts of the parties are separate property and were accumulated before marriage.”\n\nCarrie indicated to the court that she would no longer use the Romney surname after the divorce. Paulina Markey, Carrie's attorney, confirmed to PEOPLE that the divorce was not finalized at the time of Carrie's death.\n\nShe said in a statement, \"This is an immensely difficult time for Ms. Romney’s loved ones, and the family has requested privacy as they grieve. We extend our deepest condolences to them during this time.\"\n\nScott's attorney, Karen L. Goldman, previously told PEOPLE when reached for comment, \"My client has not authorized me to make any comments to media during this difficult and tragic time.\"\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nScott and Carrie wed on Nov. 16, 2016, and had no children together. Scott was married to his first wife, Ronna Romney, from 1967 to 1992, and was with his second wife, Sheri Jelalian, from 2011 to 2016.\n\nScott is a father to seven children from his previous marriages. One of his children is former Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with mental health challenges, emotional distress, substance use problems, or just needs to talk, call or text 988, or chat at 988lifeline.org 24/7.",

    "title": "The Push to Impeach Pete Hegseth Is On",
    "description": "Chris...",
    "fullText": "Democratic Representative Shri Thanedar has filed articles of impeachment against the secretary of defense over the murderous attacks on boats in the Caribbean.\n\nAs Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth becomes more deeply mired in the scandal surrounding the military strikes against alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean, familiar refrains of Beltway discourse have lurched into gear. Democrats in Congress, for instance, are issuing calls for greater “transparency” and official “accountability” and vowing to widen the probes into the murderous attacks.\n\nThere is certainly much to investigate about Hegseth, who appears to have issued a second order to kill two stranded survivors in the first strike, and then proceeded to lie about doing so. Yet, amid the well-worn rounds of congressional inquiries and special investigations, Justice Department task forces, military probes, and international court proceedings, a cabinet criminal’s forcible removal from office is an all-but-guaranteed non-result. That’s why it’s so maddening that Democratic lawmakers have largely balked at invoking the most effective tool to secure such accountability—a motion to impeach Hegseth.\n\nIt’s hard to think of a case where impeachment would be a more appropriate remedy. After all, if murder doesn’t qualify as a “high crime and misdemeanor,” what does? And an impeachment inquiry, closely targeted on documenting criminal charges, would be an encouraging first step in holding Hegseth accountable for his conduct in an actually meaningful way.\n\nOf course, an allied piece of conventional Beltway wisdom is that impeachments are inherently political—and therefore politically risky. And few Beltway operators are more conventional than the Democrats’ terminally risk-averse House leader, Hakeem Jeffries. So it wasn’t shocking when Jeffries made a point of ruling out an official impeachment inquiry not long after news of Hegseth’s role in the second strike first broke. Jeffries claimed that planned investigations by the House and Senate Armed Services Committees should produce “a meaningful investigation which we can hope would be bipartisan”—while also claiming that House Republican leaders were far too partisan to permit any impeachment articles to make it onto the legislative calendar.\n\nLeaving aside the plain self-contradictory nature of Jeffries’s stand, the mechanism of impeachment isn’t actually as cumbersome as he makes it out to be. Under Rule IX of the House, any member can bring a motion to impeach a member of the executive branch under a privileged vote—meaning that House leaders in either major party don’t need to approve it in advance. Once an impeachment resolution is introduced under Rule IX, the House has a two-day window to vote on it, in a straight up-or-down balloting—or else to endorse another resolution to dismiss the impeachment one.\n\nThis is precisely the course of action that Michigan Democratic Representative Shri Thanedar is now pursuing against Hegseth. On Tuesday, Thanedar announced that he had filed articles of impeachment against Hegseth.\n\nJust introduced House Resolution 935, Impeaching Peter B. Hegseth, Sec. of Defense for high crimes and misdemeanors.\n\nThanedar’s motion cites both the second strike carried out on September 2 and the recent damning Pentagon investigation into Hegseth’s unauthorized sharing of details of a bombing raid in Yemen on an unsecure Signal group chat. “Here’s a secretary of defense who is managing a trillion-dollar budget, sending people into harm’s way, and he needs to be acting responsibly,” Thanedar said in an interview with The Nation. “The fact that he gives out war plans on a Signal chat puts our service members in grave danger.”\n\nAs for the Caribbean strike, Thanedar added, “Really, this is murder; it has nothing to do with drugs and protecting the United States”—noting as well that President Donald Trump has recently pardoned former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernandez, who was convicted of trafficking some 450 tons of cocaine into the United States.\n\nThe first article in Thanedar’s resolution charges Hegseth with “murder and conspiracy to murder,” bypassing the more vague and euphemistic suggestion in most mainstream press reports that he may be guilty of “war crimes.” (An ancillary problem with this phrasing is that there is no declared war, or even a similarly euphemized “police action” that governs the US military’s rules of engagement in jury-rigged, barely rationalized attacks that are themselves illegal.) The article specifies that, in the September 2 attack, “in compliance with the order of Peter B. Hegseth, the Armed Forces carried out a second strike with the express, willful, and deliberate purpose of killing the shipwrecked survivors of the first strike,” citing provisions in the Defense Department’s Law of War Manual that proscribe actions that deprive survivors of quarter after attack—let alone actions that kill them outright after an initial attack. The second article calls for Hegseth to be impeached and removed from office for circulating the plans for the Yemen strike on the Signal group chat last spring.\n\nGiven that leaders in both parties want nothing to do with it, Thanedar’s resolution might not ultimately travel too far. But there’s a great deal to be said for simply initiating a serious discussion of Hegseth’s impeachment on the Hill. To begin with, an impeachment resolution represents a come-to-Jesus moment for all members of Congress to take a clear stand on Hegseth’s actions. For Democrats in particular, the continued invocation of the Trump White House’s criminal trespasses and threats to democratic self-rule start to ring hollow in the absence of clear measures to attach tangible consequences to the perpetrators. “That’s what makes them look weak,” said a consultant familiar with the Thanedar resolutions, who requested anonymity to speak candidly. “I’ve heard it before— it’s a bit of a DC elite bubble thing to say, ‘Oh, the last impeachments backfired or failed.’ But it’s not true—the Democrats didn’t really pay any price at the ballot box” after their successive bids to impeach Trump in 2019 and 2021. “I think you can’t go out there and say, ‘They’re criminals and [Trump’s] trying to be a dictator,’ which is true and important, without something to back it up. And it’s not like they’d be taking a run at this at a time when he’s at an even split in the polls; he’s got a 20 percent disapproval gap.”\n\nThat’s a key reason that, even before they were formally introduced, Thanedar’s articles of impeachment got resounding endorsements from members of the Democratic Party’s activist base. “Pete Hegseth is an incredibly unqualified Christian nationalist lackey and alleged abuser who never should have been nominated in the first place,” said Hunter Dunn, a spokesperson for the 50501 movement, which has been instrumental in organizing the successful wave of No Kings protests across the country. “His support of Russia’s war crimes, the Genocide in Gaza, his role in Signalgate, his attempts to censor press, and his overall incompetence would each be reason enough for his removal. After he murdered multiple sailors in the Caribbean, the only place he belongs is in a jail cell. As such, we’re working on a number of different avenues to push towards his ousting, including having our members contact congressional representatives and lobby for impeachment, leveraging our social media platforms to build public support for an investigation into Hegseth and his removal, and targeted demonstrations.” Thanedar, who had earlier sought to initiate an Article IX impeachment measure against Trump until Democratic leaders prevailed on him to withdraw it, is now looking for a better reception from the party’s rank-and-file members, together with some possible recruits from the chamber’s increasingly fractious GOP majority. “What we saw from the Epstein files vote was that Republicans are now willing to question this president, and are willing to go against him on the right issue.” And if nothing else, he added, a Hegseth impeachment vote should supply a record to keep organizing around. “The question is not ‘What is the politics?’ or ‘What do the polls say?’ It’s more about, “Does this amount to a crime?’ If it does, then we need to do what is right…. This puts members of Congress on notice to take a stand. That’s what we’re elected to do.”",
